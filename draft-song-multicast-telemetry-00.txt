1.  Introduction

   Multicast traffic is an important traffic type in today's Internet.
   Multicast provides services that are often real time (e.g., online
   meeting) or have strict QoS requirements (e.g., IPTV, Market Data).
   Multicast packet drop and delay can severely affect the application
   performance and user experience.

   It is important to monitor the performance of the multicast traffic.
   Existing OAM techniques cannot gain direct and accurate information
   about the multicast traffic.  New on-path telemetry techniques such
   as In-situ OAM [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] and Postcard-based
   Telemetry [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry] provide promising
   means to directly monitor the network experience of multicast
   traffic.  However, multicast traffic has some unique characteristics
   which pose some challenges on efficiently applying such techniques.

   This document describes the requirement for multicast traffic
   telemetry and shows the issues of the existing on-path telemetry

   techniques.  We then propose modifications to make these techniques
   adapt to the multicast application.

2.  Requirements for Multicast Traffic Telemetry

   Multicast traffic is forwarded through a multicast tree.  With PIM
   and P2MP (MLDP, RSVP-TE) the forwarding tree is established and
   maintained by the multicast routing protocol.  With BIER, no state is
   created in the network to establish a forwarding tree, instead, a
   bier header provides the necessary information for each packet to
   know the egress points.  Multicast packets are only replicated at
   each tree branch node for efficiency.

   There are several requirements for multicast traffic telemetry:

   o  Reconstruct and visualize the multicast tree through data plane
      monitoring.

   o  Gather the multicast packet delay and jitter performance.

   o  Find the multicast packet drop location and reason.

   o  Gather the VPN state and tunnel information in case of P2MP
      multicast.

   All of these requirements need to directly monitor the multicast
   traffic and derive data from the multicast packets.  The conventional
   OAM mechanisms such as multicast ping and trace are insufficient to
   meet these requirements.

3.  Issues of Existing Techniques

   On-path Telemetry techniques that directly retrieve data from
   multicast traffic's live network experience are ideal to address the
   above mentioned requirements.  The representative techniques include
   In-situ OAM (IOAM) [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] and Postcard-based
   Telemetry (PBT) [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry].  However,
   unlike unicast, multicast poses some unique challenges to applying
   these techniques.

   Multicast packets are replicated at each branch node in the
   corresponding multicast tree.  Therefore, there are multiple copies
   of a packets in the network.

   If IOAM is used for on-path data collection, the partial trace data
   will also be replicated into multiple copies.  The end result is that
   each copy of the multicast packet has a complete trace.  Most of the
   data is redundant.  Data redundancy introduces unnecessary header



Song & McBride           Expires January 2, 2020                [Page 3]

   overhead, wastes network bandwidth, and complicates the data
   processing.  In case the multicast tree is large and the path is
   long, the redundancy problem becomes severe.

   PBT can be used to eliminate such data redundancy, because each node
   on the tree only sends a postcard covering local data.  However, PBT
   cannot track the tree branches properly so it can bring confusion
   about the multicast tree topology.  For example, Node A has two
   branches, one to Node B and one to node D, and Node B leads to Node C
   and Node D leads to Node E.  From the received postcard, one cannot
   tell whether or not Node C(E) is the next hop of Node B(D).

   The fundamental reason for this problem is that there is not an
   identifier (either implicit or explicit) to correlate the data on
   each branch.

4.  Proposed Modifications to Existing Techniques

   We propose two solutions to address the above issues.  One is built
   on PBT and requires augmentation to the instruction header of PBT-I;
   the other combines the IOAM trace mode and PBT for an optimized
   solution.

4.1.  Per-hop postcard

   The straightforward way to mitigate the PBT's drawback is to augment
   it with a branch identifier field.  Note that this only works for the
   PBT-I variation where an instruction header is present.  To make the
   branch identifier globally unique, the branch node ID plus an index
   is used.  For example, if Node A has two branches, to Nodes B and C,
   Node A will use [A, 0] as the branch identifier for the branch to B,
   and [A, 1] for the branch to C.  The identifier is unchanged and
   carried with the multicast packet until the next branch node.  Each
   postcard needs to include the branch identifier in the export data.
   The branch identifier and the other fields such as flow ID and
   sequence number are sufficient for the data analyzer to reconstruct
   the topology of the multicast tree.

   Figure 1 shows an example of this solution.  "P" stands for the
   postcard packet.  The square brackets contains the branch identifier.
   The curly brace contains the telemetry data about a specific node.

4.2.  Per-section postcard

   The second solution is a combination of the IOAM trace mode and PBT.
   To avoid the data redundancy, at each branch node, the trace data
   accumulated so far is exported by a postcard before the packet is
   replicated.  In this case, each branch still needs to keep some
   identifier to help correlate the postcards for each tree section.
   The natural way is to simply carry the branch node's data (including
   its ID) in the trace of each branch.  This is also necessary because
   each replicated multicast packet can have different telemetry data
   pertaining to this particular copy (e.g., node delay, egress
   timestamp, and egress interface).  As a consequence of, the local
   data exported by each branch node can only contain partial data
   (e.g., ingress interface and ingress timestamp).

   Figure 2 shows an example in a part of a multicast tree.  Node B and
   D are two branch nodes so they will export a postcard covering the
   trace data for the previous section.  The end node of each path need
   to export the data of the last section as a postcard as well.

                      Figure 2: Per-section Postcard

   There is no need to modify the IOAM trace mode header format.  We
   just need to configure the branch node to export the postcard and
   refresh the IOAM header and data.

5.  Considerations for Different Multicast Protocols

   MTRACEv2 [RFC8487] provides an active probing approach for the
   tracing of an IP multicast routing path.  Mtrace can also provide
   information such as the packet rates and losses, as well as other
   diagnostic information.  New on-path telemetry techniques will
   enhance Mtrace, and other existing OAM solutions, with more granular
   and realtime network status data through direct measurements.  There
   are various multicast protocols that are used to forward the
   multicast data.  Each will require their own unique on-path telemetry
   solution.

5.1.  Application in PIM

   PIM-SM [RFC7761] is the most widely used multicast routing protocol
   deployed today.  Of the various PIM modes (PIM-SM, PIM-DM, BIDIR-PIM,
   PIM-SSM), PIM-SSM is the preferred method due to its simplicity and
   removal of network source discovery complexity.  With all PIM modes,
   control plane state is established in the network in order to forward
   multicast UDP data packets.  But with PIM-SSM, the discovery of
   multicast sources is performed outside of the network via HTTP, SDN,
   etc.  IP Multicast packets fall within the range of 224.0.0.0 through

Internet-Draft             Multicast Telemetry                 July 2019


   239.255.255.255.  The telemetry solution will need to work within
   this address range and provide telemetry data for this UDP traffic.

   The proposed solutions for encapsulating the telemetry instruction
   header and metadata in IPv4/IPv6 UDP packets are described in
   [I-D.herbert-ipv4-udpencap-eh] and
   [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-deployment].

5.2.  Application in P2MP

   Multicast Label Distribution Protocol (MLDP) and P2MP RSVP-TE are
   commonly used within a Multicast VPN (MVPN) environment.  MLDP
   provides extensions to LDP to establish point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
   and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) label switched paths (LSPs) in
   MPLS networks.  P2MP RSVP-TE provides extensions to RSVP-TE for
   establish traffic-engineered P2MP LSPs in MPLS networks.  The
   telemetry solution will need to be able to follow theses P2MP paths.
   The telemetry instruction header and data should be encapsulated into
   MPLS packets on P2MP paths.  A corresponding proposal is described in
   [I-D.song-mpls-extension-header].

5.3.  Application in BIER

   BIER [RFC8279] adds a new header to multicast packets and allows the
   multicast packets to be forwarded according to the header only.  By
   eliminating the requirement of maintaining per multicast group state,
   BIER is more scalable than the traditional multicast solutions.

   OAM Requirements for BIER [I-D.ietf-bier-oam-requirements] lists many
   of the requirements for OAM at the BIER layer which will help in the
   forming of on-path telemetry requirements as well.

   There is also current work to provide solutions for BIER forwarding
   in ipv6 networks.  For instance, a solution, BIER in Non-MPLS IPv6
   Networks [I-D.xie-bier-ipv6-encapsulation], proposes a new bier
   Option Type codepoint from the "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop
   Options" IPv6 sub-registry.  This is similar to what IOAM proposes
   for IPv6 transport.

   Depending on how the BIER header is encapsulated into packets with
   different transport protocols, the method to encapsulate the
   telemetry instruction header and metadata also varies.  It is also
   possible to make the instruction header and metadata a part of the
   BIER header itself, such as in a TLV.

   the IOAM and PBT drafts.
