   Probabilistic Loss Ratio Search for Packet Throughput (PLRsearch)
                     draft-vpolak-bmwg-plrsearch-00

Abstract

   This document addresses challenges while applying methodologies
   described in [RFC2544] to benchmarking NFV (Network Function
   Virtualization) over an extended period of time, sometimes referred
   to as "soak testing".  More specifically to benchmarking software
   based implementations of NFV data planes.  Packet throughput search
   approach proposed by this document assumes that system under test is
   probabilistic in nature, and not deterministic.

1.  Motivation

   Network providers are interested in throughput a device can sustain.

   RFC 2544 assumes loss ratio is given by a deterministic function of
   offered load.  But NFV software devices are not deterministic
   (enough).  This leads for deterministic algorithms (such as MLRsearch
   with single trial) to return results, which when repeated show
   relatively high standard deviation, thus making it harder to tell
   what "the throughput" actually is.

   We need another algorithm, which takes this indeterminism into
   account.

2.  Model

   Each algorithm searches for an answer to a precisely formulated
   question.  When the question involves indeterministic systems, it has
   to specify probabilities (or prior distributions) which are tied to a
   specific probabilistic model.  Different models will have different
   number (and meaning) of parameters.  Complicated (but more realistic)
   models have many parameters, and the math involved can be very
   complicated.  It is better to start with simpler probabilistic model,
   and only change it when the output of the simpler algorithm is not
   stable or useful enough.

   TODO: Refer to packet forwarding terminology, such as "offered load"
   and "loss ratio".

   TODO: Mention that no packet duplication is expected (or is filtered
   out).

   TODO: Define critical load and critical region earlier.

   This document is focused on algorithms related to packet loss count
   only.  No latency (or other information) is taken into account.  For
   simplicity, only one type of measurement is considered: dynamically
   computed offered load, constant within trial measurement of
   predetermined trial duration.

   Also, running longer trials (in some situations) could be more
   efficient, but in order to perform trial at multiple offered loads
   withing critical region, trial durations should be kept as short as
   possible.

3.  Poisson Distribution

   TODO: Give link to more officially published literature about Poisson
   distribution.

   Note-1: that the algorithm makes an assumption that packet traffic
   generator detects duplicate packets on receive detection, and reports
   this as an error.

   Note-2: Binomial distribution is a better fit compared to Poisson
   distribution (acknowledging that the number of packets lost cannot be
   higher than the number of packets offered), but the difference tends
   to be relevant in loads far above the critical region, so using
   Poisson distribution helps the algorithm focus on critical region
   better.

   When comparing different offered loads, the average loss per second
   is assumed to increase, but the (deterministic) function from offered
   load into average loss rate is otherwise unknown.

   Given a loss target (configurable, by default one packet lost per
   second), there is an unknown offered load when the average is exactly
   that.  We call that the "critical load".  If critical load seems
   higher than maximum offerable load, we should use the maximum
   offerable load to make search output more stable.

   Of course, there are great many increasing functions.  The offered
   load has to be chosen for each trial, and the computed posterior
   distribution of critical load can change with each trial result.

   To make the space of possible functions more tractable, some other
   simplifying assumption is needed.  As the algorithm will be examining

   (also) loads close to the critical load, linear approximation to the
   function (TODO: name the function) in the critical region is
   important.  But as the search algorithm needs to evaluate the
   function also far away from the critical region, the approximate
   function has to be well- behaved for every positive offered load,
   specifically it cannot predict non-positive packet loss rate.

   Within this document, "fitting function" is the name for such well-
   behaved function which approximates the unknown function in the
   critical region.

   Results from trials far from the critical region are likely to affect
   the critical rate estimate negatively, as the fitting function does
   not need to be a good approximation there.  Instead of discarding
   some results, or "suppressing" their impact with ad-hoc methods
   (other than using Poisson distribution instead of binomial) is not
   used, as such methods tend to make the overall search unstable.  We
   rely on most of measurements being done (eventually) within the
   critical region, and overweighting far-off measurements (eventually)
   for well-behaved fitting functions.

4.  Fitting Function Coefficients Distribution

   To accomodate systems with different behaviours, the fitting function
   is expected to have few numeric parameters affecting its shape
   (mainly affecting the linear approximation in the critical region).

   The general search algorithm can use whatever increasing fitting
   function, some specific functions can be described later.

   TODO: Describe sigmoid-based and erf-based functions.

   It is up to implementer to chose a fitting function and prior
   distribution of its parameters.  The rest of this document assumes
   each parameter is independently and uniformly distributed over common
   interval.  Implementers are to add non-linear transformations into
   their fitting functions if their prior is different.

   TODO: Move the following sentence into more appropriate place.

   Speaking about new trials, each next trial will be done at offered
   load equal to the current average of the critical load.

   Exit condition is either critical load stdev becoming small enough,
   or overal search time becoming long enough.

   The algorithm should report both avg and stdev for critical load.  If
   the reported averages follow a trend (without reaching equilibrium),

   avg and stdev should refer to the equilibrium estibated based on the
   trend, not to immediate posterior values.

   TODO: Explicitly mention the iterative character of the search.

5.  Algorithm Formulas

5.1.  Integration

   The posterior distributions for fitting function parameters will not
   be integrable in general.

   The search algorithm utilises the fact that trial measurement takes
   some time, so this time can be used for numeric integration (using
   suitable method, such as Monte Carlo) to achieve sufficient
   precision.

5.2.  Optimizations

   After enough trials, the posterior distribution will be concentrated
   in a narrow area of parameter space.  The integration method could
   take advantage of that.

   Even in the concentrated area, the likelihood can be quite small, so
   the integration algorithm should track the logarithm of the
   likelihood, and also avoid underflow errors bu ther means.

6.  Known Implementations

   The only known working implementatin of Probabilistic Loss Ratio
   Search for Packet Throughput is in Linux Foundation FD.io CSIT
   project. https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT. https://git.fd.io/csit/.

6.1.  FD.io CSIT Implementation Specifics

   In a sample implemenation in FD.io CSIT project, there is around 0.5
   second delay between trials due to restrictons imposed by packet
   traffic generator in use (T-Rex), avoiding that delay is out of scope
   of this document.

   TODO: Describe how the current integration algorithm finds the
   concentrated area.
