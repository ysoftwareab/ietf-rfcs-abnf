            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992




            Abstract

            This memo is intended to facilitate the multi-protocol
            management coexistance and interworking for networks that
            are managed using the OSI Common Management Information
            Protocol (CMIP) and networks that are managed using the
            Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  This RFC
            contains translation and registration procedures that are
            applicable to translation of Internet MIBs defined according
            to the Internet Structure of Management Information (SMI)
            into ISO/CCITT SMI defined MIBs.  It also defines management
            information and SNMP trap to ISO/CCITT event mappings
            required for ISO/CCITT-Internet proxy.

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            1. Introduction

            The past decade has witnessed the development of enterprise
            wide networks composed of a multi-vendor environment
            containing heterogeneous protocol and hardware suites.
            Organizations have become increasingly dependent on these
            enterprise networks for their daily operations.  This
            dependence has focussed attention on the need for operation,
            administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) of the
            multi-vendor enterprise network on an end-to-end basis.

            1.1 Background

            This memo is part of a package of ISO/CCITT and Internet
            Management Coexistence (IIMC) drafts.  Other memos included
            in this package are:

            - Translation of ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs to Internet MIBs
            (Newnan) [IIMCOMIBTRANS]

            - Translation of Internet MIB-II (RFC1213) to ISO/CCITT GDMO
            MIB (LaBarre) [IIMCMIB-II]

            - Translation of Internet Party MIB (RFC1353) to ISO/CCITT
            GDMO MIB (LaBarre) [IIMCPARTY]

            - ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Proxy (Chang) [IIMCPROXY]

            These memos together comprise a package aimed at integrating
            ISO/CCITT-based and Internet-based management systems.
            These memos are offered as input to coexistence and
            interworking efforts underway throughout the
            industry,including organizations such as:

            - IETF OSI Internet Management (OIM),
            - Network Management Forum Technology Convergence Team,
            - X/Open Systems Management (SysMan),
            - OIW Network Management Special Interest Group (NMSIG), and
            - OSF Management Special Interest Group (MANSIG).

            This work was initiated, in part, by NM Forum efforts to
            translate RFC 1214 for use with OMNIPoint 1 implementations.
            Through this effort, it became obvious that end-to-end
            management requires an integrated, unified view of the
            managed network, despite differences in management protocol
            and information structure.  Integrated management can be
            facilitated by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent service, protocol,
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.  MIB
            translation procedures can be used to support proxy
            management, as well as to take advantage of existing MIB
            definition and avoid duplication of effort.  In this way,
            commercial investment in both ISO/CCITT and Internet-based

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            management technologies can be preserved through deployment
            of common methods and tools which support integration.

            This overall strategy was outlined in a joint publication
            developed by the NM Forum and X/Open entitled "ISO/CCITT and
            Internet Management: Coexistence and Interworking Strategy"
            [NMFMC92].  The memos included in the IIMC package are
            intended as detailed specifications which implement several
            of the methodologies identified in this strategy.

            1.2 Overview

            The response to the need for OAM&P of enterprise networks
            has been the development of network management standards
            within various networking communities - most notably the
            ISO/CCITT and Internet community.  However, coordination of
            standards activities between these two communities has not
            occurred.  As a result, although they share a nearly common
            management model, differences in their management protocols
            and structure of management Information (SMI) have developed
            due to differing management philosophies.

            The ISO/CCITT community has developed the Common Management
            Information Protocol (CMIP) [ISO9596], and related SMI
            documents [ISO10165-1,3,4].  The Internet community has
            developed the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
            [RFC1157], and is developing its successor, SNMP-2, based on
            [SMPPROT]. The Internet SMI is defined in [RFC1155] and
            [SMPSMI]. Although functionally similar, the Internet and
            ISO/CCITT protocols and SMIs differ in terms of their
            complexity and specific operations.

            The focus on the need for end-to-end enterprise management
            has indicated the need to integrate the management of
            components managed by ISO/CCITT management, Internet
            management and proprietary management mechanisms in a manner
            which presents a unified view of the network despite
            protocol and SMI differences.  One way to integrate
            management is by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent services, protocol
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.

            A body of telecommunications and computer vendors,
            represented by organizations such as the Network Management
            Forum (NMF), and the U.S. government, as specified in the
            Government Network Management Profile (GNMP) have based
            their integrated management model on the ISO/CCITT
            management model using CMIP and the ISO/CCITT SMI.  These
            organizations are particularly interested in the development
            of proxies for devices that use the Internet management
            protocols and SMI.  Their interest is primarily due to the
            widespread commercial implementation and use of such devices
            within their enterprises, especially devices that use the
            Internet TCP/IP protocol suite.

            The proxy architecture provides emulation of CMIS services
            by mapping to the corresponding SNMP message(s) necessary to
            carry out the service request.  The service emulation allows
            management of Internet objects by an ISO/CCITT manager.  The
            left hand side of the proxy behaves like an ISO/CCITT agent,
            communicating with the ISO/CCITT manager using CMIP
            protocols.  The right hand side  of the proxy behaves like
            an Internet manager, communicating with the Internet agent
            using SNMP protocols.

            The proxy relies on the existence of a pair of directly-
            related MIB definitions, where the Internet MIB has been
            translated into ISO/CCITT GDMO using the procedures
            specified in [IIMCMIBTRANS]. The proxy defined in
            [IIMCPROXY] uses these MIB definitions and rules to provide
            run-time translation of management information carried in
            service requests and responses.

            The proxy architecture is designed with a specified
            interface between the proxy and the underlying protocol


            LaBarre                                               Page 3


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            stacks, and so deals primarily in terms of CMIS services and
            SNMP "services".  The proxy emulates services such as CMIS
            scoping and filtering, processing of CMIS operations, and
            forwarding/logging of CMIS notifications by performing a
            mapping process which must be tailored for each protocol
            (for example, SNMP, Secure SNMP, and SNMP-2 are all variants
            of the same protocol mapping process).

            Finally, [IIMCOMIBTRANS] specifies translation procedures
            for converting ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs into Internet MIBs.  MIBs
            generated by this translation process cannot be utilized by
            the Proxy defined in [IIMCPROXY], although another kind of
            Proxy could be defined for this purpose in the future.

            1.3 Scope

            A major reason for the rapid commercialization of devices
            manageable via the Internet management protocol is due to
            the speed with which the vendors in the Internet community
            have been able to develop MIBs based on the Internet SMI.
            To capitalize on this continuing Internet MIB development
            and their deployment in commercial devices, communities
            interested in integrated management via ISO/CCITT-Internet
            proxies require that procedures be defined for translation
            of Internet MIBs into ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs, i.e., MIBs
            defined according to the ISO/CCITT SMI Guidelines for
            Definition of Managed Objects [ISO10165-4].  Such MIB
            translations may also minimize the independent development
            of ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs for the same resources and thereby
            reduce the incompatibilities with the Internet MIBs.

            Of particular interest to the community interested in
            ISO/CCITT-Internet proxies, are translation procedures which
            may be automated to a high degree and include unambiguous
            automated registration procedures.  This memo defines such
            procedures.

            This memo also defines the ISO/CCITT-Internet proxy
            management information and generic SNMP trap to CMIS
            notification mappings required for ISO/CCITT-Internet proxy
            managers, as well as common naming conventions and ASN.1
            modules applicable to such proxies.

            This memo assumes that the reader is familiar with the
            ISO/CCITT SMI and Internet SMI, and the terminology of each.
            The term SNMP will be used throughout the memo to indicate
            either SNMP or SNMP-2, unless a distinction needs to be
            made.

            As of the publication date of this memo, the SNMP-2 SMI and
            protocol are evolving.  It is expected that the [SMPPROT],
            [SMPSMI], [SMPMIB], [SMPTC] and related documents will be
            the basis of that evolution, and that changes will not

            significantly affect the registration, naming, and
            translation procedures described in this memo.

            Many, but not all, of the procedures defined in this memo
            are subject to automation.  Comments are provided concerning
            possible aids to automation; however, it is not the intent
            of this memo to provide automated translation algorithms.

            2. Registration and Naming Procedures

            Registration and naming procedures are crucial to the unique
            identification of management information.  Registration
            assures the uniqueness of management information element
            types, while naming provides a way of distinguishing
            instances of a type and locating them within the MIB.

            2.1 Registration Procedures

            Registration procedures specify that changes in the syntax
            or semantics of registered entities require them to be
            registered as new entities.  The process of converting
            Internet MIBs into the ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs inevitably
            introduces subtle semantic changes in how data can be
            operated on, and changes in the content of the MIB element.
            For example, ISO/CCITT attributes that are converted from
            Internet Object Types acquire matching rules for use in
            filtering operations.  ISO/CCITT object classes that are
            created from Internet groups acquire semantics related to
            their inheritance of new attributes from the "top" managed
            object class.  The end result is that all the new ISO/CCITT
            object classes, attributes, and notifications created during
            the translation process must be registered.  In addition,
            name bindings for inserting object instances into the naming
            hierarchy must be registered.

            Registration procedures are critical to the goals of
            automating the translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT
            GDMO format, and the efficient implementation of ISO/CCITT-
            Internet proxies.  Registration involves assignment of an
            ASN.1 Object Identifier (OID) to the entity.  Management
            entities defined according to the principles of the Internet
            SMI may be registered under the IAB's "internet" arc, or
            registered under an arc in another organization's
            proprietary registration subtree.  The effect of the
            registration procedure specified in this document is to
            graft the MIB elements defined as a subtree under the
            "internet", or proprietary, registration arc into another
            part of the registration tree without changing the subtree
            structure.

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992



            For example, OIDs registered under the internet arc are of
            the form:

                 OID = <internet> <internetEntityId>

            where <internet> is the full registration path to the
            "internet" arc; and <internetEntityId> is the portion of the
            OID that uniquely identifies entities under that arc, i.e.,
            the remainder of the OID.

            OIDs registered under another organization's arc are of the
            form:

                 OID =  <organization> <internetEntityId>

                 and <organization> = <org arc> <org internet part>

            where <org arc> is the arc assigned to the organization by
            ISO, CCITT, ANSI, or some other registration authority; <org
            internet part> is the path within the organization's subtree
            down to the subtree that identifies MIB entities defined
            according to the Internet SMI (an organization's internet
            subtree); and <internetEntityId> is that portion of the OID
            that uniquely identifies entities within the organization's
            internet subtree.

            Registration is accomplished by replacing the <internet> or
            <organization> portion of the OID with a new registration
            arc allocated for proxy registration such that the OID is of
            the form:

                 OID = <cmipsnmpProxyXX> <internetEntityId>

            This procedure preserves the unique identification of the
            entities within the subtree, and since the new arc to which
            it is attached is unique, assures a unique OID.  Also, since
            the original subtree information is present in the new OID,
            implementation of proxy translation of the corresponding
            management entities identified differently in the two SMIs
            is made easier.

            Internet defined groups and objects must be registered as
            ISO/CCITT object classes and attributes; Internet traps must
            be registered as ISO/CCITT notifications; and ISO/CCITT name
            bindings must be defined and registered.  This memo assumes
            that an arc has been allocated in the registration hierarchy
            for use in ISO/CCITT-Internet proxy registration.  The arc
            is named "cmipsnmpProxy".  This memo assigns sub-arcs under
            "cmipsnmpProxy" as follows:

            cmipsnmpProxy       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {...}

            cmipsnmpProxyIMIB   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {cmipsnmpProxy 1}

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


                 -- for ISO/CCITT derived object classes and attributes

            cmipsnmpProxyNB     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {cmipsnmpProxy 2}
                 -- for ISO/CCITT derived NAME BINDINGS

            cmipsnmpProxyNOT    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {cmipsnmpProxy 3}
                 -- for ISO/CCITT Notifications

            This memo assigns OIDs in 4.5 for registration of ISO/CCITT
            entities derived from internet entities registered under the
            "internet" arc, and for registration of entities defined in
            this memo.

            The following describes registration procedures to
            facilitate automated translation and assure uniqueness of
            registered ASN.1 object identifiers for ISO/CCITT object
            classes, attributes, and notifications derived from internet
            entities; and a registration procedure for their name
            bindings.

            2.1.1 Object Classes and Attributes Registration

            Follow the procedure described in 2.1, using the internet
            assigned OID for the group, conceptual table, or conceptual
            table entry from which the object is derived, with
            {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB} substituted for {cmipsnmpProxyXX}.

            2.1.2 Notifications Registration

            Notifications are registered using the OID corresponding to
            the value of the Internet smpTrapOID object defined in
            [SMPMIB].

            For SNMP trap PDUs the smpTrapOID is derived as stated in
            the SNMP/SNMP-2 Coexistance memo [SMPCOEX] 4.1.2(2).  That
            definition is repeated below:

            "... if the value of the generic-trap field is
            'enterpriseSpecific' then the value used is the
            concatenation of the enterprise field from the trap PDU with
            additional sub-identifiers, '0', and the value of the
            specific-trap field."

            For traps defined according to the SNMP-2 SMI, the
            registered OID for the TRAP-DEFINITION macro is the value of
            the smpTrapOID.

            The registered OID for the ISO/CCITT derived notification is
            then translated from the value for smpTrapOID according to
            the procedures in 2.1 with {cmipsnmpProxyNOT} substituted
            for {cmipsnmpProxyXX}.

            2.1.3 NAME BINDINGs Registration



            LaBarre                                               Page 7


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            As described in 2.2.2 , the ISO/CCITT SMI requires that
            managed object instances be bound into a naming hierarchy,
            or tree, for purposes of naming.  ISO/CCITT NAME BINDING
            templates are used to register the manner in which such
            instances may be bound.  These name bindings must be
            registered.

            The Internet SMI does not include the concept of a naming
            tree and name binding.  Thus, there exists no registered
            Internet entity from which an OID for the ISO/CCITT NAME
            BINDING template can be derived.  One solution is to use the
            object class OID to register name bindings under an special
            registration arc {cmipsnmpProxyNB} which is different from
            the arc used to register notifications, object classes and
            attributes. The following procedure is recommended for
            registration of name bindings for an object class to be
            inserted into the naming hierarchy, i.e., the subordinate
            object class:

                o  Replace the {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB} portion of the
                  ISO/CCITT defined OID for the object class, derived
                  using the procedures of  2.1.1, with {cmipsnmpProxyNB
                  <sub-dentifier>}.  The integer <sub-identifier> is
                  used to distinguish possible multiple name bindings
                  for the same object class.  Sub-identifier values
                  shall be greater than or equal to 1.

            2.2 Naming Procedures

            ISO/CCITT object instances are identified by specifying
            read-only attributes within the object class as naming
            attributes.  The naming attribute is used to form the
            relative distinguished name of the object instance.  The
            sequence of relative distinguished names that trace the path
            in the naming hierarchy from the root to the object forms a
            distinguished name that uniquely identifies the object
            instance.

            2.2.1 Naming Attribute

            The conversion of Internet MIBs into ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs
            requires that naming attributes be defined and registered
            for each ISO/CCITT object class.

            This paper specifies a generic naming attribute, and the
            conventions for its value definition, to facilitate
            automated generation of naming attributes for object classes
            derived from Internet MIBs.  This generic naming attribute
            is applicable to all ISO/CCITT object classes derived from
            Internet defined MIBs.

            The generic naming attribute, "internetClassId",  is of
            ASN.1 type OBJECT IDENTIFIER with the following conventions
            for its value, as per the conventions in [RFC1212]:

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992



                 o For ISO/CCITT object classes that may have only a
                    single instance per managed system, the value is the
                    OID for the object class concatenated with a "0".
                    Object classes derived from the Internet TCP, UDP,
                    and IP groups are examples of such object classes.

                 o For object classes that may have multiple instances
                   per managed system, such as table entries, the value
                   is the concatenation of the ISO/CCITT object class
                   OID and the Internet object instance identification
                   (an OID) of the form specified for the table entry
                   instance identification in the original Internet MIB
                   definition.  The Internet object instance
                   identification is the the concatenation of the values
                   of the Internet OBJECT-TYPE(s) identified in the
                   conceptual table entry OBJECT-TYPE INDEX clause.  If
                   an SNMP-2 AUGMENTS clause is present, the instance
                   identification is the concatenation of the values of
                   the OBJECT-TYPE(s) identifed in the INDEX clause of
                   the table entry referenced in the value of the
                   AUGMENTS clause.

                   The formats for naming attributes of table entries
                   are compatible with instance identification
                   conventions used by the Internet, thereby
                   facilitating the automated conversion of Internet
                   MIBs into ISO/CCITT SMI format and the name mapping
                   required for proxy management.

            2.2.2 ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy Naming Tree

            The ISO/CCITT SMI requires that managed object instances
            (conventionally just called managed objects) be bound into a
            naming hierarchy, or tree, for purposes of naming.  This
            hierarchy is often called the containment hierarchy.  The
            binding must specify for each managed object class: the
            object class which is superior to it in the containment
            hierarchy; and a naming attribute in the object class that
            is used to distinguish instances of the object class at a
            given level in the hierarchy.  The name binding is specified
            after the object class has been defined.  Multiple name
            bindings may be defined and registered that locate the
            object instances at different places in the naming
            hierarchy.

            This memo defines a subtree of the naming hierarchy for the
            ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy MIB to be used in ISO/CCITT-
            Internet proxies.  The subtree is rooted at the
            "cmipsnmpProxyTable" object defined in 4.  Each entry in the
            table, called "cmipsnmpProxyAgent", corresponds to an SNMP
            agent in a managed system.  MIB elements specific to each
            agent are subtrees of a "cmipsnmpProxyAgent" instance.

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            One name binding for the "cmipsnmpProxyTable" object is
            specified which binds it to the ISO/CCITT "system" object
            class defined in [ISO10165-2].  Other name bindings may be
            specified.

            The ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy MIB is organized using the
            conventions of tables and table entries to optimize the
            benefits of CMIS scoping.  While this is not required by the
            ISO/CCITT SMI or CMIS, it minimizes the number of objects to
            which filtering must be applied, or the number of objects
            that are returned if filtering is not applied with scoping.

            A Naming Tree diagram for the ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy MIB
            defined in this memo, the object classesdefined in the Party
            MIB [IIMCPARTY], and the MIB-II [IIMCMIB-II] is illustrated
            below.  Although the ISO/CCITT "system" object class is
            shown to be the root of the tree, other object classes may
            be used.  Object classes derived from groups in other
            Internet defined MIBs, that are specific to an SNMP agent,
            are bound to the "cmipsnmpProxyAgent" managed object, or to
            other objects within the cmipsnmpProxyAgent sub-tree as
            appropriate.

            2.2.3 Distinguished Names

            The distinguished name (DN) of a managed object consists of
            a sequence of relative distinguished names (RDN), one for
            each managed object on the naming path from the root to the
            managed object.  Each relative distinguished name contains
            exactly one attribute, the "naming" attribute for the
            corresponding class, as specified by a NAME BINDING
            template.  This DN is used as the CMIP ManagedObjectInstance
            parameter for identifying managed objects.

            For example, a distinguished name designating a particular
            routing table entry (of class ipRouteEntry) might be

            {
                      O O O
                                          -- higher level object RDNs
            {internetClassId = {cmipsnmpProxyPMIB 1 0}}
                                          -- cmipsnmpProxyTable
            {cmipsnmpProxyAgentId = "troi.mitre.org" }
                                          -- cmipsnmpProxyAgent
            {internetClassId = {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB 2 1 4 0}} 
                                          -- ip
            {internetClassId = {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB 2 1 4 21 0}} 
                                          -- ipRouteTable
            {internetClassId = {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB 2 1 4 21 129 83 2 17}}
                                          -- ipRouteEntry
            }

            The "internetClassId" naming attribute definition, to be
            used for object classes derived from the Internet MIBs, can
            be found in the ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy MIB defined in 4 of
            this memo.

            2.3 OID Translation
            The procedures required to translate between Internet
            registered OIDs and names, and ISO/CCITT registered
            attribute and class OIDs are described in this section.

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992



            2.3.1 OID/Name Translation ISO/CCITT to Internet

            The general procedure for deriving ISO/CCITT registered OIDs
            from Internet OIDs was explained in 2.1, and the structure
            of the naming attribute value was explained in 2.2.  This
            paragraph explains how the information used in an ISO/CCITT
            class OID, attribute OID, and the naming attribute value may
            be used to create the identifier for naming Internet
            objects.

            The following definitions apply: ((c) and (a) refer to class
            and attribute, respectively)

            From 2.1,

                 {classOID}     ::= {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB
                                     <internetEntityId>(c)}

            For example

                 ipRouteTable ::= {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB 2 1 4 21 }
                 where <internetEntityId>(c) ::= 2 1 4 21.

                 {attributeOID}  ::= {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB
                                     <internetEntityId>(a)}

            For example,

                 ipRouteNextHop ::= {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB 2 1 4 21 1 7}
                 where <internetEntityId>(a) ::= 2 1 4 21 1 7.

            From 2.2, the naming attribute value contains the OID formed
            as, (the "( )" indicates "contents of"):

                 (naming attribute)  ::=  {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB
                                           <internetEntityId>(c)
                                           <internet instanceId>}

            where the <internet instanceId>, the OID created uniquely
            for each Internet object instance, is "0" for object classes
            that may only have a single instance.

            For example, the naming attribute value for the instance of
            ipRouteEntry specific to IP address 129 83 2 17 is
            {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB 2 1 4 21 1 129 83 2 17}, where
            <internetEntityId>(c) ::= 2 1 4 21 1, and <internet
            instanceId> ::=  129 83 2 17.

            The Internet uses the following convention to uniquely
            identify an Internet object instance:

                 {internet object name}::= {<internet> or <organization>
                                           <internetEntityId>(a)


            LaBarre                                              Page 12


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


                                           <internet instanceId>}

            For example, the internet object name for ipRouteNextHop
            corresponding to IP address 129 83 2 17 is {internet 2 1 4
            21 1 7 129 83 2 17}, where <internetEntityId>(a) ::= 2 1 4
            21 1 7, <internet instanceId> ::=129 83 2 17.

            Therefore, given the contents of the naming attribute for
            the ISO/CCITT object instance being accessed the <internet
            InstanceId> and <internet> or <organization> are extracted.
            Given the attributeOID for the attribute being operated
            upon, the <internetEntityId>(a) is extracted.  The {internet
            object name} is then formed from the results.

            For example, assume that a CMIS request is issued specifying
            a distinguished name for an ipRouteEntry managed object as
            illustrated in 2.2.3; and an attribute for ipRouteEntry, say
            ipRouteNextHop.  The ipRouteNextHop attribute has been
            assigned the identifier {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB 2 1 4 21 1 7} in
            the MIB defined in [IIMCMIB-II].  Therefore, the
            ipRouteNextHop attribute identifier would first have to be
            translated into the corresponding Internet identifier
            {internet 2 1 4 21 1 7} by substituting "internet" for
            "cmipsnmpProxyIMIB".  Then, from the RDN value for the
            ipRouteEntry extract the <internet instanceId> {129 83 2
            17}.  Finally the Internet identification for this piece of
            management information would be constructed according to
            RFC1213 as {ipRouteNextHop 129 83 2 17}, or equivalently,
            {internet 2 1 4 21 1 7 129 83 2 17}.  The system in which
            this information resides is identified in the
            "cmipsnmpProxyAgent" RDN as "troi.mitre.org."

            2.3.2 OID/Name Translation Internet to ISO/CCITT

            Given the definitions shown in 2.3.1, the ISO/CCITT
            {classOID}, {attributeOID}, and distinguished name can be
            derived from Internet OIDs and names.

            - The cmipsnmpProxyIMIB value is known.

            - The <internetEntityId>(a) value is extracted from the
            {internet object name}, and combined with the
            cmipsnmpProxyIMIB value to form the {attributeOID}.

            - The {classOID} can be determined by finding the ISO/CCITT
            object class to which the attribute identified as
            {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB <internetEntityId>(a) } belongs.

            NOTE:  Avoid the temptation to derive the {classOID} from
            the {attributeOID} by assuming that the {attributeOID}
            ={classOID <integer>}.  Sometimes post-processing procedures
            may combine attributes from multiple classes into a single
            class.  See 3.3 for a discussion on this issue.

            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            2.4 Inheritance for Object Classes

            The "top" class defined by [ISO10165-2] is the ultimate
            superior in the ISO/CCITT inheritance hierarchy.  The class
            "top" contains attributes which are inherited by all managed
            object classes that are defined using the ISO/CCITT SMI and
            GDMO templates.

            Not all attributes of "top" need to be instantianted in any
            single managed object.  All objects should instantiate the
            mandatory "objectClass", and "nameBindings" attributes.  If
            multiple packages may apply, an object should instantiate
            the "packages" attribute.

            2.5 Reference Labels for Derived Entities

            The labels used to reference Internet entities (groups,
            objects, traps) should be used to reference the
            corresponding templates for the derived ISO/CCITT entity
            (object class, attribute, notification).


            3. Internet to ISO/CCITT MIB Translation Procedures

            The procedures for translating Internet SMI MIBs into
            ISO/CCITT SMI MIBs consist of pre-translation procedures,
            GDMO template translation procedures, and post-translation
            procedures.  Many of the procedures are subject to
            automation; some are not.  Comments are provided concerning
            possible aids to automation; however, it is not the intent
            of this memo to provide automated translation algorithms.

            3.1 Pre-translation Procedures

            Pre-translation procedures are outlined below.  The
            rationale for steps (a) - (e) is that the ISO/CCITT object
            classes and associated attributes must be identified.  The
            rationale for steps (f) - (g) is that all ASN.1 syntax
            references in templates must be an ASN.1
            Externaltypereference or Externalvaluereference, i.e., must
            reference a label that appears on the left side of an ASN.1
            construct within some ASN.1 module that appears in the
            document that defines the derived MIB.  Internet MIBs often
            reference basic ASN.1 constructs, such as INTEGER and OCTET
            STRING, which must be converted into an
            Externaltypereference.  Default values must reference an
            Externalvaluereference.

                 (a) Identify Internet groups and OBJECT-TYPEs
            associated with each group.  For SNMP-2 defined MIBs, the
            OBJECT-GROUP macro includes this information.  For SNMP
            defined MIBs, the group may be identified manually and then
            the members of the group identified by the fact that their



            LaBarre                                              Page 14


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            OIDs contain the group object identifier.  For SNMP defined
            MIBs, procedure (c) must be followed.

                 (b) Identify conceptual table OBJECT-TYPEs, conceptual
            table entry (row) OBJECT-TYPEs associated with each table,
            and columnar OBJECT-TYPEs associated with each conceptual
            table entry.

            Note: For SNMP-2 defined MIBs, the MAX-ACCESS clause of the
            OBJECT-TYPES macro will have a value of 'not-accessible' and
            the convention often used is to include the word "Table" or
            "Entry" in the macro label.  Once a table has been
            identified the corresponding entry OBJECT-TYPE macro can be
            identified via its registered object identifier through the
            convention of appending a 1 to the table object identifier.
            SNMP defined MIBs are not so consistent in their use of
            "not-accessible"; however, the other conventions apply.

            Note: For SNMP-2 defined MIBs, tables may be defined with
            table entries that augment (SNMP-2 AUGMENT clause) entries
            for an existing table.  The table object classes derived
            from such tables will be deleted from the ISO/CCITT MIB
            during post-translation (see 3.3.3).  The table entry object
            class for the deleted table will be bound to the table entry
            object class that corresponds to the reference in the
            AUGMENTS clause.

                 (c) For each group, the OBJECT-TYPEs not identified in
            procedure (b) and not having an ACCESS clause value of "not-
            accessible" are identified for translation into attributes
            of an ISO/CCITT object class.

                 (d) For each conceptual table entry OBJECT-TYPE, the
            columnar OBJECT-TYPEs associated with the table entry and
            not having an ACCESS clause value of "not-accessible" are
            identified for translation into ISO/CCITT attributes of an
            ISO/CCITT object class.

                 (e) For each conceptual table, an ISO/CCITT object
            class is created that contains the generic naming attribute
            "internetClassId".  OBJECT-TYPES that are directly
            associated with the table become attributes of that table.

                 (f) Create an ASN.1 module.  For each OBJECT-TYPE that
            is to be translated into an ISO/CCITT attribute, check the
            value of the SYNTAX clause, and if it is not one of the
            Internet attribute types defined by the SNMP or SNMP-2 SMI
            (Counter, IpAddress, Gauge, TimeTicks, Opaque, Counter32,
            Gauge32, Counter64, NsapAddress), or defined using an SNMP-2
            TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro, then do one of the following:

                      i)  If the value is not an Externaltypereference:
                      create an Externaltypereference for the value in



            LaBarre                                              Page 15


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


                      the SYNTAX clause and put it into the ASN.1 
                      module.


                      ii) If the value is an Externaltypereference:
                      put the Externaltypereference value into the
                      ASN.1 module.  The ASN.1 module is used for the
                      GDMO template translations.

                 g) Create an Externalvaluereference which has the type
            indicated by the OBJECT-TYPE SYNTAX clause and is assigned
            the value of the DEFVAL clause.

            For convenience, an ASN.1 module of common definitions for
            Externaltypereferences of the basic ASN.1 types included in
            the SNMP SMI and SNMP-2 SMI (e.g., INTEGER, OCTET STRING) is
            defined in 4.5.  The Externaltypereferences in this module
            must either be imported into a local ASN.1 module within the
            document that defines the derived MIB, or appropriate
            equivalent references need to be declared within the local
            ASN.1 module.

            3.2 GDMO Translation Procedures

            Readers of this memo are assumed to have familiarity with
            the GDMO templates and their format.  The templates
            presented here should be considered exemplar, and not
            definitive.

            The GDMO templates in this paragraph contain elements
            indicated by "< x >", where "x" is to be interpreted and the
            result substituted into the template.

            The "||" symbol indicates concatenation of elements.

            Adjacent elements that are not concatenated should be
            separated by at least one space.

            The "[ ]" symbols surrounding a construct indicate that it
            may be present or absent in any particular instance of the
            template.

            The "[ ]*" symbols surrounding a construct indicate that it
            may be present or absent in any particular instance of the
            template an undefined number of times.

            An "|" symbol is used to indicate  that a choice must be
            made between alternate constructs.

            The "!" symbol is used to delimit text strings in the
            templates.  Other delimiters may be used, as specified by
            the GDMO.  The delimiter may not be used in the text string
            unless it is "doubled", e.g., "!!".



            LaBarre                                              Page 16


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            Elements that are defined in one template are not repeated
            for other templates unless changes are made to its
            interpretation.

            Note: other SNMP-2 SMI macro clauses contain textual or
            other information that may be inserted into the BEHAVIOUR
            clause of the an ISO/CCITT template, e.g., UNITS, REFERENCE.
            Provisions for including information in these macro clauses
            are not explicitly described in the translation procedures
            below, however the contents of these clauses should be
            included in the BEHAVIOUR clause.

            The Internet SNMP-2 SMI also includes macros for specifying
            compliance with the MIBs.  These macros correspond to
            ISO/CCITT managed object conformance statements (MOCS), and
            are not addressed here.

            3.2.1 Translation of Groups

            Internet groups may be translated to ISO/CCITT managed
            object classes by filling in the following GDMO template:

            <group label>  MANAGED OBJECT CLASS
                      DERIVED FROM
                          "Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 : 1992" :top
                 CHARACTERIZED BY
                          <group label> || "Pkg" PACKAGE
                     [BEHAVIOUR
                      <group label> || "PkgBehaviour" BEHAVIOUR
                      DEFINED AS !<optional textual definition>!;;]
                     ATTRIBUTES
                      internetClassId     GET
                      ["," <OBJECT-TYPE label n>
                      <OBJECT-TYPE label n ACCESS clause translation>
                      [DEFAULT VALUE  <DEFVAL clause translation>]]*;
                 [NOTIFICATIONS  <notification label>
                            ["," <notification label>]*;];;
            REGISTERED AS  { {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB} <internetEntityId>(c)
            };

            The following definitions apply:

                 <group label> - The label associated with the Internet
                 group.

                 <optional textual definition> - Any textual description
                 that is applicable to the resource modelled by this

                 in the SNMP-2 DESCRIPTION clause of the OBJECT-GROUP

                 The mapping of the ACCESS (or SNMP-2 MAX-ACCESS) clause

                 clause in the form of an Externalvaluereference, i.e.,
                 <module-name>.<value-name>, where the module-name is 
                 the name of an ASN.1 module within the document in 
                 which this object class is defined, and the value-name 
                 is the label assigned to the ASN.1 value definition 
                 contained in the DEFVAL clause.  Where it is necessary 
                 to refer to the label of a definition contained in 
                 another document, this may be achieved by means of a 
                 local ASN.1 module which makes use of the ASN.1 IMPORTS
                 mechanism to import the appropriate value definition.

            3.2.4 Translation of Other OBJECT-TYPES

            Other Internet OBJECT-TYPEs are translated into ISO/CCITT
            attributes by filling in  the following GDMO template:

            <OBJECT-TYPE label> ATTRIBUTE
                 [WITH ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
                     <module identification>|| "." ||
                                     <SYNTAX clause translation 1>
                  [MATCHES FOR <SYNTAX clause type matching rules>;] ]
               |  [DERIVED FROM <SYNTAX clause translation 2>]
                  [BEHAVIOUR
                      <OBJECT-TYPE label>  || "Behaviour" BEHAVIOUR
                      DEFINED AS  !<DESCRIPTION clause text>!;;]
            REGISTERED AS {{cmipsnmpProxyIMIB} <internetEntityId>(a)};

            The following definitions apply:

                 <module identification> - The label of the ASN.1 module
                 that contains the ASN.1 syntax being referenced.  The
                 module must appear in the document that defines the
                 translated MIB.

            ISO/CCITT have the concept of a generic "attribute type",
            which is a defined type that can be used in the definition
            of specific attributes.  Attribute types have a defined
            syntax, generic semantics, and matching rules.  For example,
            counter and gauge are attribute types.

            The SNMP-2 SMI has a similar concept embodied in the
            TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS macro, which allows the definition of
            "Internet attribute types"  with associated syntax and
            semantics.  See 3.2.6 for translation procedures associated
            with the TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS macro.

            Attributes of the defined SNMP types (Counter, IpAddress,
            Gauge, TimeTicks, Opaque, Counter32, Gauge32, Counter64,
            NsapAddress) should inherit the semantics associated with
            the type - not just the syntax.  As such, they could have
            been defined as Internet attribute types using a TEXTUAL
            CONVENTIONS macro.  See 4.3 for the conversion of these
            types into ISO/CCITT attribute types.  In addition, 4.3
            contains ISO/CCITT attribute type definitions derived from
            [SMPTC].

            Attribute templates derived from OBJECT-TYPE macros that
            specify these Internet attribute types in their SYNTAX
            clause should contain the DERIVED FROM clause.  Attribute
            templates derived from other ASN.1 types should contain the
            WITH SYNTAX and MATCHING RULES clauses.

                 the ASN.1 Externaltypereference notation as GDMO 
                 requires.

                 <SYNTAX clause type matching rules> - The matching 
                 rules for use in CMIS filtering operations.

                 Note: This normally is a manual process; however
                 matching rules that generally apply for some specific
                 types are provided in the table below.  These rules 
                 also to Externaltypereferences that reference the 
                 syntax type.  These matching rules may be applied by 
                 automated mechanisms and then examined in the post-
                 translation.

                      The * indicates the matching rules that are
                      inherited from the ISO/CCITT attribute type as
                      defined in 4.3.

                      The (x) indicates counters and gauges of differing

                 NsapAddress),and Internet attribute types defined using

                 as ISO/CCITT attribute types.  Specific attributes are

            3.2.5 Translation of Traps

            The Concise MIB Definitions [RFC1212] for SNMP does not
            contain a macro for representing traps since, in SNMP, traps
            were considered part of the protocol and not part of the
            MIB.  A subsequent attempt was made to correct this problem
            in [RFC1215] by defining a TRAP-TYPE macro.  The SNMP-2 SMI
            [SMPSMI] defines a TRAP-DEFINITION macro and its mapping
            onto an SNMP-2 PDU.  The memo on SNMP/SNMP-2 Coexistance
            [SMPCOEX] defines a mapping between SNMP and SNMP-2 trap
            PDUs.  Therefore, by inference, there exists a mapping of
            SNMP trap PDUs into an SNMP-2 TRAP-DEFINITION macro.  This
            memo assumes that SNMP trap PDUs will be translated into
            SNMP-2 trap PDUs, and that by inference the mapping into a
            SNMP-2 TRAP-DEFINITION exists.

            The translation of Internet traps, as defined for SNMP Trap
            PDUs and the SNMP-2 TRAP-DEFINITION macro, may be translated
            to ISO/CCITT notifications by filling in the following GDMO
            template:

            <trap label>  NOTIFICATION

                 <DESCRIPTION and OBJECTS/VARIABLES clause translation>-
                 The value of the TRAP-DEFINITION OBJECTS (or TRAP-TYPE
                 VARIABLES) clause indicates the names of the attributes
                 to be inserted into the monitoredAttributes field of 
                 the trap.  A sentence indicating this fact should be
                 inserted into the text of the DESCRIPTION clause and 
                 the result becomes the text for the template BEHAVIOUR
                 clause.  The text describing behaviour for SNMP traps
                 and the attributes to be inserted into the
                 monitoredAttributes field for traps not specified using
                 a macro is not defined.

            The IpAddress of the SNMP agent in the SNMP Trap PDU is
            missing from the SNMP-2 TRAP-DEFINITION macro.  The address
            may be inferred from the managed system's domain name in the
            "cmipsnmpProxyEntryId" RDN of the DN contained in the
            ManagedObjectInstance field of the CMIP event report that
            carries the notification.

            Similarly, the SNMP PDU "generic-trap", and "specific-trap"
            fields are missing from the SNMP-2 trap PDU and SNMP-2 TRAP-
            DEFINITION macro.  The information contained in these fields
            are combined into the registered object identifier for the
            SNMP-2 TRAP-DEFINITION macro.  This object identifier
            corresponds to the smpTrapOID object defined in [SMPMIB].

                 <notificationOID> - The OID for the notification as
                 derived in 2.1.2.

            3.2.6 Translation of Internet Attribute Types

            ISO/CCITT has the concept of a generic "attribute type",
            which is a defined type that can be used in the definition
            of specific attributes.  Attribute types have a defined
            syntax, generic semantics, and matching rules.  For example,
            counter and gauge are attribute types.

            The SNMP-2 SMI has a similar concept embodied in the
            TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro, which allows the definition of


            LaBarre                                              Page 23


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            "Internet attribute types" with associated syntax and
            semantics.

            Attributes of the defined SNMP types (Counter, IpAddress,
            Gauge, TimeTicks, Opaque, Counter32, Gauge32, Counter64,
            NsapAddress) should inherit the semantics associated with
            the type - not just the syntax.  As such, they could have
            been defined as Internet attribute types using a TEXTUAL-
            CONVENTION macro.

            ISO/CCITT attribute types are defined using the ATTRIBUTE
            template, without the REGISTERED AS clause.

            <Internet attribute type label> ATTRIBUTE
                      [WITH ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
                       <module identification>|| "." ||
                                <SYNTAX clause translation 1>
                      [MATCHES FOR
                           <SYNTAX clause type matching rules>;] ]
                  |   [DERIVED FROM <SYNTAX clause translation 2>]
                      [BEHAVIOUR
                      <Internet attribute type label>   || "Behaviour"
                           BEHAVIOUR
                           DEFINED AS  !<DESCRIPTION clause text>!;;]

            The following definitions apply:

                 <Internet attribute type label>  - The label associated
                 with the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro, or with the
                 generic type that could have been defined using that
                 macro.

            Attribute templates derived from OBJECT-TYPE macros that
            specify Internet attribute types in their SYNTAX clause
            should specify the corresponding ISO/CCITT attribute types
            in their DERIVED FROM clause.

            3.3 Post-translation Procedures

            Post-translation procedures generally includes manual
            checking of the BEHAVIOUR clause text for proper behaviour
            definitions, the addition of information concerning
            variables for creation and deletion, the assignment of
            notifications to an appropriate ISO/CCITT object class, and
            the creation of name bindings for placing the derived
            ISO/CCITT objects into the containment hierarchy.  However,
            sometimes the procedures are not so straightforward.

            Post-translation procedures may result in deletion of some
            ISO/CCITT MIB elements derived from the procedures described
            in 2.2. For example, if the table object class contains
            entries that were derived from Internet OBJECT-TYPES that
            contained an AUGMENTS clause, then the table is deleted from
            the MIB.


            LaBarre                                              Page 24


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992



            Post-translation procedures may also result in the
            combination multiple ISO/CCITT MIB object classes to form
            one class.  The multiple object classes should perhaps
            belong to a single object class, but were created as
            separate object classes due to specific SNMP SMI
            requirements.  The resulting multiple object classes may be
            constrained to synchronize their behaviour, e.g., to
            synchronize creation and deletion procedures.  However, when
            viewed from an ISO/CCITT context, the rationale for using
            multiple objects may disappear, or ISO/CCITT SMI and
            protocol constraints may prohibit their use.  See
            [IIMCPARTY] for an example of this situation.

            3.3.1 Post-translation of BEHAVIOUR Cause

            The SNMP and SNMP-2 text descriptions often contain
            SNMP/SNMP-2 protocol, or SMI, relevant information that is
            inappropriate for an ISO/CCITT object class or attribute;
            such text should be removed or properly modified.

            A reference to the Internet MIB entity from which the
            ISO/CCITT entity was derived should be added.

            Descriptions of circumstances that cause the generation of
            specific notifications should be included.

            Information should be added that is relevant to attributes
            for instance identification and creation/deletion status.
            Such information should be added in a way that facilitates
            automated parsing of the BEHAVIOUR clause.  The use of
            keywords is recommended.

            Multiple instance objects should be indicated by the
            keywordS "MULTIPLE INSTANCE" in the text.

            The text should include relevant information related to
            instance identification in the form of the full INDEX or
            AUGMENTS clause.

            The status variable, and its value for deletion, must be
            described for table entries that may be created and deleted
            by management action.  The following format should be used:

                 STATUSVAR      ::= <label>
                 STATUSDELETE   ::= <value>

            where <label> is the label of the attribute used to indicate
            deletion of an entry,  and <value> is the value which
            indicates deletion.  The value specification should be
            consistent with the type of the status attribute.

            3.3.2 Post-translation of Notifications



            LaBarre                                              Page 25


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


            The ISO/CCITT SMI models notifications as being emitted by
            specific managed objects.  As a consequence, notifications
            must be assigned to appropriate object classes at the time
            the object class is defined.  New notifications cannot be
            added to an object class without changing its registration.

            The fact that the ISO/CCITT SMI models notifications as
            being emitted by specific managed objects implies that
            notifications may only contain information known to the
            managed object.  However, the Internet SMI has no explicit
            concept of traps being associated with an object.  They may
            contain information related to multiple internet objects.
            Consequently, some notifications may be derived from SNMP
            traps that contain variables not affiliated with the same
            derived ISO/CCITT object class.  This memo allows variables
            to be placed into a notification even if they are not
            attributes of the object class from which the notification
            is emitted.

            The following procedures should be applied:

                 1) identify the object class that corresponds to the 
                 resource to which the notification applies.

                 2) insert the notification into the NOTIFICATIONS 
                 clause of the object class.

            3.3.3 Creation of NAME BINDING Templates

            The ISO/CCITT name bindings for object classes to be bound
            into the naming hierarchy described in 2.2.2 are created by
            filling in the GDMO template defined below.

            <object class label>-NB  NAME BINDING
                          SUBORDINATE OBJECT CLASS
                           <object class label>  AND SUBCLASSES;
                          NAMED BY SUPERIOR OBJECT CLASS
                           <superior object class label> AND SUBCLASSES;
                          WITH ATTRIBUTE internetClassId;
                          [CREATE [<create modifier>] ;]
                          [DELETE [<delete-modifier>];]
            REGISTERED AS { <name binding OID>};

                 <object class label> - the reference label of the 
                 object class to which the name binding applies.

                 <superior object class label> - the reference label of
                 the superior object class in the naming hierarchy.

                 Object classes derived from groups normally have the
                 "cmipsnmpProxyAgent" object class as their superior.

                 Table object classes, derived from conceptual tables,
                 have the object class derived from the group in which


            LaBarre                                              Page 26


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


                 they were defined as their superior.  One way to
                 determine the group is to use the structure of the OID
                 for the table object, i.e., it contains the internet
                 specific portion of the OID for the group.  However, if
                 the table object class contains entries that were
                 derived from Internet OBJECT-TYPES that contained an
                 AUGMENTS clause, then the table is deleted from the 
                 MIB. The reason for this is that the ISO/CCITT SMI 
                 prohibits adding attributes to an object class.  The 
                 solution used in this memo is to make a table entry 
                 object class that augments another table entry the 
                 direct subordinate of the table entry object class 
                 being augmented.  The table is no longer needed.

                 Table entry object classes, derived from conceptual
                 table entries, have the corresponding table object 
                 class as their superior.  One way to determine the 
                 table is to use the structure of the OID for the table 
                 entry object class, i.e., it contains the internet 
                 specific portion of the OID for the table.However, 
                 table entry object classes derived from OBJECT-TYPES 
                 that contain an AUGMENTS clause have the table entry 
                 object class derived from the OBJECT-TYPE referenced in
                 the AUGMENTS clause as their superior.

            The Internet SMI only allows the possibility of conceptual
            table entries being created and deleted.  Many table entries
            are automatically created and deleted as a result of normal
            resource operation.

            For SNMP-2 defined MIBs, if the table entry contains an
            OBJECT-TYPE that has a SYNTAX clause value of "RowStatus"
            and a MAX-ACCESS clause value of "read-create", then the
            table entry may be created and deleted.

            For SNMP defined MIBs, the use of an OBJECT-TYPE within a
            table entry which indicates "RowStatus" is inconsistant.
            Usually, the text definition for the table entry may need to
            be consulted to determine if creation and deletion are
            allowed, and the columnar object and associated value which
            indicates deletion.

                 <create modifier> - the "WITH-AUTOMATIC-INSTANCE-
                 NAMING" modifier should be part of the CREATE clause if
                 the object class is being used for proxy.  This allows
                 the proxy, which is closer to the resource than the
                 manager, to assign instance names.  The "WITH-
                 REFERENCE-OBJECT" may also be be used.

                 <delete-modifier> - The delete modifier for the DELETE
                 clause should be "DELETES-CONTAINED-OBJECTS"
                 if the table entry contains an object class added as a
                 result of an SNMP-2 OBJECT-TYPE AUGMENTS clause.

            4.  ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy MIB

            The ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy MIB defines a set of objects
            for specifying the information that is needed for both
            community-based and party-based SNMP management on a per
            SNMP agent basis.

            The ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy MIB defines the
            "cmipsnmpProxyTable" object class which contains entry
            object classes named "cmipsnmpProxyAgent".   The
            "cmipsnmpProxyAgent" has information to identify SNMP agents
            and how they may be reached.  Its naming attribute, which
            contains the administratively assigned name of the managed
            device where the SNMP agent is located, is used in the
            naming hierarchy to identify the SNMP managed device.

            The definition of these two object classes and their
            attributes are defined in 4.1.

            4.1 Object and Attribute Definitions

            ISO/CCITT-Internet proxy MIB object classes and attributes
            are assigned OIDs under the {cmipsnmpProxyPMIB} arc.  The
            Internet convention of registering attributes under the
            object class to which they belong is followed in this memo.

            cmipsnmpProxyAgent MANAGED OBJECT CLASS
                        DERIVED FROM
                           "Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 : 1992" :top;

                           cmipsnmpProxyAgentPkgBehaviour BEHAVIOUR
                      DEFINED AS
                      !This managed object class is used to represent an
                      SNMP/SNMP-2 agent in the proxy MIB.  Each agent
                      that the proxy manages is represented by an
                      instance of this object class.

                      The cmipsnmpProxyAgentId attribute contains the
                      administratively assigned name of the managed
                      system that contains the SNMP/SNMP-2 agent.
                      Usually this is an Internet Domain Name.  The 
                      value is determined by the manager when the object
                      is created.

                      The proxyOID attribute contains the proxy arc
                      used in the re-registration and derivation of
                      OIDs.  The following sub-arcs are assigned:

                           {<proxyOID> 1} - object classes, attributes


            LaBarre                                              Page 28


            Draft  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT MIBs 10/9/1992


                           {<proxyOID> 2} - name bindings
                           {<proxyOID> 3} - notifications

                      The replaceByProxyOID attribute contains the
                      "internet" OID or an organization specific OID.
                      The portion of the OID for an internet defined
                      object that corresponds to the replaceByProxyOID
                      contents is replaced by {<proxyOID> 1} when
                      translating internet object OIDs into ISO/CCITT
                      OIDs, and {<proxyOID> 3} when translating internet
                      trap OIDs into ISO/CCITT notification OIDs.

                      The managementProtocol attribute specifies the
                      Internet management protocol used by the proxy to
                      manage devices.  It may be an OID indicating
                      SNMP, SNMP-2, or some other protocol.  This
                      attribute is assigned a value (an OID) by the 
                      manager that is appropriate to the agent.

                      The supportedMIBs attribute contains the set of
                      OIDs of registered MIBs that the agent supports.
                      The manager may add or remove elements to/from
                      this attribute.

                      The specificAccessControlUsed attribute indicates
                      whether access control specific to an SNMP agent
                      is none, uses Internet defined mechanisms and MIB
                      elements, or uses ISO/CCITT defined mechanisms and

                      The accessControlEnforcement attribute indicates
                      where access control is applied: SNMP agent, 
                      proxy, or both.

                      The operationalState attribute indicates the
                      perceived state of the agent in the managed
                      system:

                           The "enabled" state means that the agent
                           is operational, as perceived by the proxy,
                           i.e., it can be reached.

                           The "disabled" state means that the agent
                           is not operational, as perceived by the
                           proxy, i.e., it cannot be reached.

                      The administrativeState attribute is used to
                      suspend and resume the proxy activity relative to
                      the agent.

                           The "unlocked" state means that proxy
                           must continue to perform, or resume
                           performing, proxy activities on behalf of the
                           agent.

                           The "locked" state means that the proxy
                           must not perform, or suspend performing, 
                      proxy activities on behalf of the agent.

                      The authenticationFailure notification is
                      emitted when the SNMP agent is the addressee of a
                      protocol message that is not properly
                      authenticated.

                      The coldStart notification is emitted when the 
                      SNMP agent reinitializes itself such that its
                      configuration may be altered.

                      The warmStart notification is emitted when the 
                      SNMP agent reinitializes itself such that its
                      configuration is not altered.

            {cmipsnmpProxyMISC 2} arc.  The name bindings are registered
            by appending two sub-identifiers: the first sub-identifier
            is associated with the object class to which the name
            binding applies, the second sub-identifier identifies the
            instance of the name binding for that object class.  The
            second sub-identfier must be greater than or equal to 1.

            Internet Attribute types defined by the SNMP-2 TEXTUAL-
            CONVENTION macro are translated into ISO/CCITT attribute
            types.  Attributes of the defined SNMP/SNMP-2 types
            (Counter, IpAddress, Gauge, TimeTicks, Opaque, Counter32,
            Gauge32, Counter64, NsapAddress), which could also have been
            defined in a TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro, are also considered
            to be Internet attribute types.

            ISO/CCITT Attribute templates derived from these types
            should contain the DERIVED FROM clause.

            The following ISO/CCITT attribute types, listed in
            alphabetical order, are derived from Internet attribute
            types to facilitate Internet MIB translation.  Other
            attributes may be derived from these types.

            4.4 Notifications for SNMP/SNMP-2 Traps

            Notification templates for the SNMP generic traps are listed
            here in alphabetical order.  They are registered under the
            {cmipsnmpProxyNOT} arc with sub-identifiers allocated
            according to the SNMP-2 assignment for generic traps.

            Pending progression of SNMP-2 to an Internet standard, and
            the subsequent assignment of OIDs under the "internet" arc,
            this memo has not assigned OIDs for the standard
            notifications defined in [RFC1157] and [SMPMIB].

                      An authenticationFailure notification signifies
                      that the SNMP/SNMP-2 entity, acting in an agent
                      role, has received a protocol message that is not
                      properly authenticated. The snmpEnableAuthentraps
                      attribute of the snmp object class indicates
                      whether this notification will be generated by an

            4.6 ISO/CCITT-Internet Proxy Communications

            An ISO/CCITT-Internet proxy requires knowledge of the SNMP
            agent's "community string" or SNMP "party" values to
            communicate with the agent.  This information may be placed
            in MIB elements defined in the SNMP Party MIB [IIMCPARTY]
            which is derived from the Internet MIB defined in [RFC1353].
            Therefore the proxy must also include, at a minimum, the
            "partyTable" and "partyEntry" object classes defined in
            [IIMCPARTY].  These object classes contain the information
            required for party-based security (including authentication,
            integrity, and confidentiality services), and are adapted
            for use with community-based security.  The MIB defined in
            [RFC1353] is also included in the SNMP-2 MIB [SMPMIM].

            The Party MIB may also contain information required for
            controlling access to operations on management information
            based on an access control list mechanism.  Access control
            list information is contained the "aclTable" entries.
            Constraints on what information may be accessed may be
            placed in the "viewTable" entries.
