1.  Introduction

1.1.  Abbreviations

   o  TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

   o  MPTCP: Multi-Path TCP

1.2.  Multi-Path TCP

   The Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) extension for the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) has been defined in [3], [4], [1], [2], [5].  There
   are also detailed introductions provided for example by [8], [9] as
   well as lots of further information material on [6].  MPTCP is
   therefore not introduced in more detail here.

1.3.  Scope

   The scope of this document is to collect some experiences with the
   usage of MPTCP in the NorNet testbed, a large-scale Internet testbed
   for multi-homed systems.

2.  Testbed Evaluation

2.1.  The NorNet Testbed

   The NorNet testbed (https://www.nntb.no) introduced in [11], [15],
   [10] is a programmable testbed platform with focus on the evaluation
   of multi-homed systems.  It consists of programmable nodes that are
   distributed all over Norway as well as further locations in other
   countries.  NotNet is built and operated by the Simula Research
   Laboratory and financed by Forskningsraedet (the Research Council of
   Norway) through their INFRASTRUKTUR program (project number 208798/
   F50).

   NorNet has two main components: NorNet Core and NorNet Edge.  NorNet
   Core consists of currently 20 programmable sites
   (https://www.nntb.no/pub/nornet-configuration/NorNetCore-Sites.html),
   most of them multi-homed to several network providers.  Details can
   be found in [12], [14], [11] and [16].  NorNet Edge consists of
   several hundreds of smaller nodes connected to all mobile broadband
   providers in Norway (http://robustenett.no/map), details can be found
   in [13].  Together, these two components offer a unique platform for
   experimental networking research.  NorNet is made available to the
   international networking research community.

   Further details on NorNet can be found on the NorNet website [17].

2.2.  Multi-Path TCP in NorNet

   The NorNet nodes are Linux-based and therefore run the Linux MPTCP
   implementation by Universite catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve (see
   [18]).  With support by all NorNet Core nodes (circa 100 nodes at
   currently 20 sites) and most NorNet Edge nodes (several hundreds),
   NorNet probably provides the world's largest MPTCP experimentation
   platform.

2.3.  NetPerfMeter

   NetPerfMeter [19], [7] is a network performance meter for the UDP,
   TCP, MPTCP, SCTP and DCCP transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.  It
   simultaneously transmits bidirectional flows to an endpoint and
   measures the resulting flow bandwidths and QoS.  The results are
   written as vector and scalar files.  NetPerfMeter is provided in
   NorNet to allow for transport protocol comparisons and transport
   protocol performance evaluations.

3.  Research Results and Work in Progress

   So far, work has been done on evaluating MPTCP in the real-world
   Internet.  The following list is a short overview of current
   research:

   o  [20] examines the different properties of 3G paths (UMTS as well
      as CDMA2000) in NorNet Edge.  These results provide an overview of
      the QoS characteristics that can be expected by multi-path
      transport protocols (and particularly by MPTCP) on different
      paths.

   o  [21] analyzes the impact of buffer bloat on MPTCP connections over
      mobile broadband (2G, 3G) and WLAN paths.  Furthermore, it
      proposes and evaluates Multi-Path Transport Bufferbloat Mitigation
      (MPT-BM), a bufferbloat mitigation algorithm to improve MPTCP
      performance in buffer-bloated wireless networks.

   o  [22] examines the performance benefits of multi-path transport
      with MPTCP under heterogeneous wireless networks.  It furthermore
      introduces and evaluates the Dynamic Relative Path Scoring
      (DRePaS) algorithm that optimizes the path management in such
      setups.

   o  [23] examines the performance benefits of the state-of-the-art
      Linux MPTCP implementation in a large-scale NorNet setup, covering
      sites in multiple countries on different continents.  It
      particularly also shortly introduces the NetPerfMeter measurement
      tool that is used to perform the measurements, and particularly
      its extension for MPTCP.

   o  [24] examines how the IPv4/IPv6 identity duality can be utilized
      with MPTCP in order to improve performance even in case of only a
      single ISP connection.

   o  [25] provides an introduction to the NetPerfMeter tool for MPTCP
      experiments.

   o  [26] presents MPTCP's architecture and multi-path congestion
      control algorithm concepts.  Then, it examines three test
      scenarios in the NorNet testbed, particularly highlighting the
      performance difference between using uncoupled and coupled
      congestion controls in multi-homed, real-world Internet setups.

   o  [27] introduces a scanning infrastructure to search for MPTCP-
      capable hosts in the Internet.  In a study, it used the top-1M
      Alexa servers to test the platform and gain insight about server
      support for MPTCP.

   o  [28] proposes a practical shared bottleneck detection (SBD)
      algorithm for MPTCP, namely MPTCP-SBD.  Through extensive
      emulations, it is shown that MPTCP-SBD outperforms all currently
      deployed MPTCP coupled congestion controls by accurately detecting
      bottlenecks resulting in throughput gains in the absence of shared
      bottlenecks, while remaining fair to TCP in shared bottlenecks
      scenarios.

   o  [29] proposes a send-window BLocking ESTimation scheduler, BLEST,
      which aims to minimise head-of-line-blocking in heterogeneous
      networks.  BLEST increases the potential for capacity aggregation
      by reducing the number of spurious retransmissions.

   o  [30] examines path management strategies for MPTCP in real-world,
      multi-homed Internet setups.  Particular goal is to highlight the
      performance impact of different path management and congestion
      control settings in such realistic scenarios.

   o  [31] analyses the actual buffer size requirements for MPTCP in
      heterogeneous, multi-homed Internet setups.  Particular goal is to
      provide some guidelines on buffer size requirements for achieving
      a reasonable throughput, while on the other hand not wasting
      resources.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations on MPTCP are described in [3].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
