Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the RTCP XR extended report
   packet type blocks to support the monitoring of video over IP 
   and the associated audio streams, if present, for video encapsulated
   in MPEG Transport carried over RTP.
   [Note: this draft contains the MPEG transport metrics that were
   formerly in the draft-ietf-avt-rtcpxr-video-00.txt draft, which has
   now been divided into four drafts]

1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined
   in RFC3611 for use in Quality of Service reporting for video over IP.
   The new block type defined in this draft is the MPEG Transport
   Metrics Report Block. It is intended to support both the
   identification of problems affecting performance and the collection
   of data that may be useful in optimizing system configuration.

   The metrics defined in this document are based on terminology and
   error events described in ETSI TR 101 290 [5] that relate to MPEG
   Transport packets.  The metrics that define summaries and counts
   of these error events are based on work within the ATIS IIF QoSM
   Working group [4] (Author's note, this is expected to be a published
   ATIS standard by Q3, 2007).

2.  Definitions

2.1 MPEG-2 Transport Protocol

   The MPEG-2 Transport Protocol is a simple encapsulation of video
   or audio data into fixed length packets with a header.  MPEG-2
   Transport packets are often multiplexed and may be carried over
   RTP or directly over UDP.

   3.2.1 Header
   The header comprises:
     (i) Block Type for this report block
     (ii) Reserved (set to 0xFF)
     (iii) Block length in words (set to 0x0008)
     (iv) SSRC of the received RTP stream that this report refers to
     (v) Program ID (PID) for the audio or video stream to which
         this report relates
     (vi) Reserved (set to 0xFFFF)

   3.2.2 Report Timestamp
   The time at which this report was generated (format?)

   3.2.3 Measurement Interval
   The interval of time over which these metrics were measured,
   expressed in milliseconds.

   3.2.4 Continuity Error Count
   A count of the number of Continuity_count_errors (as defined in
   TR 101 290 [5]).  This count shall not be reset if the maximum
   value is reached.


Clark                                                          [Page  3]

draft-ietf-avt-rtcpxr-mpts-00.txt                              July 2007

   Continuity count errors are defined as out-of-sequence, duplicate
   and lost packets.

   3.2.5 TS Sync Loss Count
   A count of the number of TS_sync_loss errors (as defined in
   TR 101 290 [5]).  This count shall not be reset if the maximum
   value is reached.

   TS sync loss errors are defined as a loss of sychronization
   by the transport stream.

   3.2.6 Sync Byte Error Count
   A count of the number of Sync_byte_error errors (as defined in
   TR 101 290 [5]).  This count shall not be reset if the maximum
   value is reached.

   Sync byte errors are defined as the value 0x47 not being
   present as the first byte of the MPEG transport header.

   3.2.7 PSI Error Count
   A count of the number of PSI (Program Specific Information) errors.
   This count shall not be reset if the maximum value is reached.

   PSR errors are defined (in [4]) as TR 101 290 PAT and PMT errors
   including PAT_error, PAT_error_2, PMT_error, PMT_error_2, CRC
   error on PAT or PMT.

   3.2.8 PID Error Count
   A count of the number of PID_errors (as defined in TR 101 290 [5]).
   This count shall not be reset if the maximum value is reached.

   A PID error is the condition that a packet with the specified PID
   has not occurred for a specified threshold period of time.

   3.2.9 PCR Jitter
   The PCR Overall Jitter, as defined in TR 101 290 [5] expressed in
   microseconds.

   Video systems that do not rely on the accuracy of the PCR clock
   MAY set this value to 0.

   3.2.10 PCR Failure Count
   A count of the number of PCR failures. This count shall not be reset
   if the maximum value is reached.
   
   PCR failures are defined as TR 101 290 PCR_error, PCR_repitition_
   error, PCR_discontinuity_indicator_error, PCR_accuracy_error.

   Video systems that do not rely on the accuracy of the PCR clock
   MAY set this value to 0.

4. Summary

  This draft defines an RTCP XR report block for MPEG Transport, for
  use in video quality reporting.  This is intended for in-service
  monitoring of video streaming, IPTV and IP videoconferencing
  services to provide real time performance feedback and support
  performance management. 


5. IANA Considerations

  The block type "mmm" will need to be replaced with an IANA assigned
  number within those allocated for RTCP XR report blocks (RFC 3611).

6.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.

7. Acknowledgments

   The metrics in this draft are based on work performed in the ATIS
   IIF QoSM WG.
