1.  Introduction

   This draft uses short and skippable extension header format defined
   by [RFC3344] and offers a generalized solution to exchange
   information like address of DNS server, address of previous FA etc.

1.1  Glossary of Terms

      FA	Foreign Agent

      HA	Home Agent

      MN	Mobile Node

      HA	Home Agent

      DNS	Domain Name Server

      DHCP	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

      SIP	Session Initiation Protocol


1.2  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

2.  Mobile IP Extension for Configuration Options Exchange

   The Mobile IP extension SHALL have the format shown in this section
   to carry information like IPv4 address.  Note that this extension MAY
   be included as a part of Mobile IP Registration Request.  If this
   extension is requested in the Registration Request, the network
   entity (mentioned in the Entity-Type field) SHOULD provide requested
   information in the Registration Reply.  If multiple Sub-Types are
   needed in the same message, the configuration options header SHOULD
   be repeated for each Sub-Type.

            Figure 1: Configuration Options Exchange Extension

      Type

         IPV4-CONF-OPTIONS-EXT-TYPE=TBD.  This extension value will be
         assigned by IANA from the numbering space defined in [RFC3344]
         for skippable extensions.

      Length

         Represents 8-bit unsigned integer (in octets).  Length of the
         extension includes the extension type and the extension Length
         fields.  This field MUST be set to 1 plus the total length of
         the Data and Entity-Type fields.

      Sub-Type

         This field describes the type of entity, whose information is
         requested from the network entities (mentioned in Entity-Type
         field) when used in a configuration options extension for
         Registration Request.  But it describes the type of entity,
         whose information is included in Data field when used in a
         configuration options extension for Registration Reply.
         Currently the following types are defined:

         PRIMARY-DNS-SERVER = TBD

         SECONDARY-DNS-SERVER = TBD

Internet-Draft                                                 July 2005


         PREVIOUS-FOREIGN-AGENT = TBD

         PRIMARY-SIP-SERVER = TBD

         SECONDARY-SIP-SERVER = TBD

         DHCP-SERVER = TBD

         MULTIMEDIA-MESSAGING-SERVER = TBD

         BROADCAST-MULTICAST-CONTROL-SERVER = TBD

      Entity-Type

         This field in a configuration options extension for
         Registration Request includes the type of the network entity
         from whom the information is requested.  When this field is
         included in the configuration options extension for
         Registration Reply, it refers to the network entity that
         inserts the Data field.  Currently the following types are
         defined:

         HOME-AGENT = TBD

         FOREIGN-AGENT = TBD

      Data

         This field is inserted in a Registration Reply by the network
         entity mentioned in the Entity-Type of the Registration
         Request.  This field represents the data of the network entity
         mentioned in the Sub-Type.

3.  Processing of Configuration Options Extension

   When a network entity (mentioned in the extension format of the
   Entity-Type) adds a configuration options extension to a Registration
   Request or Registration Reply message, this extension MUST appear
   prior to any authentication extensions added by that entity.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This draft defines new Mobile IPv4 extension of types IPV4-CONF-
   OPTIONS-EXT-TYPE as defined in Section 2 of this document.  This
   value MUST be assigned by IANA from the Mobile IP numbering space for
   skippable extensions.  Additionally, unique values MUST be assigned
   to each member of the Sub-Type and Entity-Type fields.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security aspects imposed by this document in
   addition to the one defined in [RFC3344].
