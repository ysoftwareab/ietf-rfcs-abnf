Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


1. Introduction

   Location information needs to be protected against unauthorized
   access to preserve privacy of the owner of the location information.
   The GEOPRIV working group has defined a protocol-independent model
   for access to geographic information.  The model includes a location
   generator (LG) that produces location information, a location server
   (LS) that authorizes access to location information, a location
   recipient (LR) that requests and receives information, and a
   rulemaker (RM) that provides policy rules to the LS which enforce
   access control policies on access to a target.

   Two policy rule namespaces have been defined.  The first basic rule
   set [10]  can restrict how long the receiver can retain the
   information and it can prohibit any further distribution of the
   information.  It does not allow to customize information to specific
   receivers, for example.  This document describes an enhanced rule set
   that provides richer constrains on location objects, including the
   basic rules in [10].

   We refer to any element that uses the rules in this document to
   restrict the retention or distribution of information as a rule
   enforcer. Typically, these are LS and LR.

   This rule set allows the rule enforcer to enforce access restrictions
   on location data, including prohibiting any dissemination to
   particular individuals or during particular times.  The rule maker
   can also stipulate that only certain parts of the location object are
   distributed to recipients or that the resolution of parts of the
   location object is limited.

   Below, we describe how different types of using protocols might
   employ the rules described in this document.  We assume that a basic
   location object [10] can contain a reference to additional rule sets.
   Note that the protocols used to query location information (between
   LS and LR), update policies at the location server and the protocol
   between the LG to LS and from LS to LR do not have to be the same.

   In all cases, the abstract sequence of operations is similar.  The LS
   receives either a query for location data or receives an update for
   the location of the target, via the using protocol.  The using
   protocol provides the identity of the requestor, either at the time
   of the query or subscription to the location information.  This
   verified location recipient identity, together with other information
   contained in the location information or generally available to the
   server, is then used to search the rule set.  All matching rules are
   combined according to a merging algorithm described in this document.
   The resulting rule is applied to the location data, yielding a

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


   possibly modified location object that is delivered to the location
   recipient.

   A single LS may serve location data in more than one mode.  Rather
   than having different rulesets for different modes, this document
   takes the approach of supporting all three modes in one ruleset
   schema. Specific instances of the ruleset can omit elements that are
   only applicable to the subscription model.  The three different modes
   are explained below.

1.1 Passive Request-Response - LS as Server (Responder)

   In a passive request-response scenario, the LR queries the LS for
   location information about the target.  Examples of protocols
   following this mode of operation include HTTP, ftp, LDAP, finger or
   various RPC protocols, including Sun RPC, DCE, DCOM, Corba and SOAP.

   The LS uses the rule set to prevent the transmission of information
   to the LR by refusing the request or to filter the information by
   removing elements or by reducing the resolution of elements.

1.2 Request-Response - LS as Client (Initiator)

   Alternatively, the LS may contact the LR and convey the location
   information, e.g., to obtain some location-specific service.
   Examples include HTTP, SIP session setup (INVITE request), H.323
   session setup or SMTP.

1.3 Event Notification

   Event notification adds a subscription phase to the "LS as client"
   mode of operation.  A watcher or subscriber asks to be added to the
   notification list for a particular presentity [cite] or event.  When
   the presentity changes state or the event occurs, the LS sends a
   message to the LR containing the updated state.  (Presence is a
   special case of event notification; thus, we often use the term
   interchangeably.)

   In addition, the subscriber may itself add a filter to the
   subscription, limiting the rate [cite] or content [cite] of the
   notifications.  If an event, after filtering by the
   rulemaker-provided rules and by the subscriber-provide rules, only
   produces the same notification content that was sent previously, no
   event notification is sent.

   For SIP, the model is described in more detail in [cite].

   Thus, for this model, a policy is needed for both subscription and

   notification operations.  While both can be expressed in separate
   policy rulesets, it is often helpful to synchronize the two.  For
   example, it allows the location server to indicate to the subscriber
   what kind of information the subscriber can obtain.  A subscriber may
   decide that the information is too limited to be of use and thus drop
   the subscription before wasting its own resources or those of the LS.
   (This does not reveal any additional information since the
   notification has to indicate the data received.)

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


2. Goals and Assumptions

   Below, we summarize our design goals and constraints.

   Table representation: Each rule must be representable as a row in a
      relational database.  This design goal should allow efficient
      policy rule implementation by utilizing standard database
      optimization techniques.

   Permit only: Allowing both 'permit' and 'deny' actions requires some
      rule ordering which has implications to the update operations
      executed on these rules.  Additionally it makes distributed rule
      sets more complicated.  An advantage is the more efficient rule
      handling.  However, to avoid complex conflict resolution with
      these rules only 'permit'.  This also implies that rule ordering
      is not important.  Consequently, to make achieve a policy decision
      it is necessary to process all policy rules.

   Additive permissions: A query of the location recipient is matched
      against the rules in the rule database.  If several rules fire
      then, the location recipient obtains the permissions of all rules.

   Upgradeable: It should be possible to add additional rule elements
      later, without breaking location servers that have not been
      upgraded.  Any such upgrades must not degrade privacy constraints,
      but may reveal less information than the rulemaker would have
      chosen.

   Versioning support: In addition to the previous goal, a rule maker
      should be able to determine which types of rule elements are
      supported by the LS.  We assume that the number of different
      versions of rule sets is best kept modest, so that a capability
      indication rather than an enumeration of fields is sufficient.
      This capability indication may take the form of indicating support
      for an XML namespace.

   Protocol-independent: The rule set supports constraints on both
      notifications or queries as well as subscriptions for event-based
      systems such as presence systems.

   No false assurance: It appears more dangerous to give the user the
      impression that the system will prevent disclosure automatically,
      but fail to do so with a significant probability of operator error
      or misunderstanding, than to force the user to explicitly invoke
      simpler rules.  Among the rules proposed in earlier working group
      discussion, rules based on weekday and time-of-day ranges seem
      particularly subject to misinterpretation and false assumptions on
      part of the rulemaker.  (For example, a non-technical rulemaker

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


      would probably assume that the rules are based on the timezone of
      his current location, which may not be known to other components
      of the system.)

3. Non-Goals

   We explicitly decided that a number of possibly worthwhile
   capabilities are beyond the scope of this first version.  Future
   versions may include these capabilities, using the extension
   mechanism described in this document.  Non-goals include:

   No queries: Following the model being pursued for presence
      information, we do not support the notion of queries where the LR
      requests only a subset of the information available. This can
      readily be separated into a separate rule set and has different
      properties and authentication models.

   No external references: Attributes within specific rules cannot refer
      to external rule sets, databases, directories or other network
      elements.  Any such external reference would make simple database
      implementation impossible and would severely impact the
      scalability of the LS.  External references also add significant
      failure handling complexity.  An LS would have to make decisions
      on how long or often to attempt, what credentials to use and how
      to query.  Thus, any such queries would have to be constrained to
      queries expressible as URIs.

   No regular expression or wildcard matching: Conditions are matched on
      equality or 'greater-than'-style comparisons, not regular
      expressions, partial matches such as the SQL LIKE operator (e.g.,
      LIKE "%foo%") or glob-style matches ("*@example.com").  Most of
      these are better expressed as explicit elements.  For example, if
      it were desired to allow domain matches, the domain of the LR
      should be identified as a separate condition element.

   No all-except conditions: It is not possible to express exclusion
      conditions based on identities such as "everybody except Alice".
      This is not only a ruleset limitation, but a limitation inherent
      in many access control systems (such as [8]).  Limitations on the
      identity of this type do not provide rich functionality since it
      is easy for users such as Alice to acquire a different identity
      that is not blacklisted.

   No repeat times: Repeat times are difficult to make work correctly,
      due to the different time zones that LG, LS and LR may occupy.  It
      appears that suggestions for including time intervals are often
      based on supporting work/non-work distinctions, which
      unfortunately are difficult to capture by time alone.

4. Basic Data Model

   A rule set consists of zero or more rules.  The ordering of these
   rules is immaterial.  The rule set can be stored in the LS and
   conveyed from RM to LS as a single document, in subsets or as
   individual rules. In addition, the LO can carry these rules as a data
   object, e.g., as multi-part MIME, or reference them via a URI. These
   alternatives are described in more detail in Section Section 4.2.

   While the rules are encoding in XML, this is purely an exchange
   format between RM and LS.  Additionally, if rules are attached to the
   location object then the rules are encoded in XML.  The format does
   not imply that the RM or the LS use this format internally, e.g., in
   matching a query with the policy rules.  The rules are designed so
   that a LS may translate the rules into a relational database table,
   with each rule represented by one row in the database.  The database
   representation is by no means mandatory; we will use it as a
   convenient and widely-understood example of an interna
   representation.  The database model has the advantage that operations
   on rows have tightly defined meanings.  In addition, it appears
   plausible that larger-scale implementations will employ a backend
   database to store and query rules, as they can then benefit from
   existing optimized indexing, access control, scaling and integrity
   constraint mechanisms.  Smaller-scale implementations may well choose
   different implementations, e.g., a simple traversal of the set of
   rules.

   A rule consists of three types of elements (or fields):  conditions,
   transformations and actions.  (Some people have also used the term
   matching rules, matching conditions or constraints for what we term
   conditions.) One can think of the "conditions" part as the 'if' part
   of a statement, the transformations and actions as the "then" part of
   the statement.  Since only one type of action i.e. 'permit' is
   allowed it does not need to be represented.

   Transforming permissions ask the entity using the rules to modify the
   location object, e.g., to remove or modify a particular element.
   Actions cause the location server to take a certain action, such as
   adding a subscription.

4.1 Civil Location

   TBD:  The description below is only included for concreteness, since
   a civil location object has not yet been defined and the description
   does not make sense without.  It will migrate to a separate document.

   This designation offers street-level precision.

                                Table 1


4.2 Rule Transport

   We make no assumption as to how rules are conveyed to entities within
   the network.  Purely as examples, we below describe a few plausible
   options.  None of the elements depend on the properties of how rule
   sets are conveyed to an LS or LR.  Mechanism may allow partial
   updates of rule sets.  To simplify such partial updates, we include
   an identifier in each rule.  This identifier is only unique among all
   the rules for a single target.

   Transaction semantics for policy rule update is not required since
   'permit only' and 'additive permissions' properties have to be used
   (as described in Section 2).  These properties also prevent
   inconsistency during concurrent query and update operations.

4.2.1 HTTP

   A rule set could be uploaded to the LS via an HTTP POST operation or
   more fully-featured WEBDAV.  Each rule could be modeled as a single
   'file', with the rule identifier as a file name.  (Since multiple
   rules may have the LR identity in the condition part of the rule, the
   LR identity cannot be used.) One example of this approach includes
   XCAP [6].

   The rule set can also be referenced from within a location object.
   The attribute 'ruleset-reference' specified in Section 2.2.2 of [10]
   and contains a URI that indicates where a fuller ruleset of policies
   related to this object can be found. The URI MAY alternatively use
   the CID URI scheme in which case it MUST denote a MIME body carried
   with the Location Object by the using protocol.

4.2.2 SIP Message Body

   The rule set can be carried, as a separate MIME message body, in the



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


   SIP message that conveys location information from a LG (a SIP UAC)
   via an LS (a SIP proxy) to an LR (a SIP UAS).  The ruleset would then
   govern the behavior expected of the LR.

4.2.3 Location Object

   The ruleset can be carried in location objects in two ways:  by
   reference and by value.  In any case the 'ruleset-reference'
   attribute inside the LO [10] points to to the location of the rules.

   Instead the LG or LS can include the ruleset itself.

   One of the transformations of the ruleset is the removal of the
   ruleset described here before further transmission.  Only the whole
   ruleset can be removed.

4.3 Securing the Location Object

   The Geopriv requirements draft [2] addresses the minimal security
   protection required for the Location Object:  Mutual end-point
   authentication, data object integrity, data object confidentiality
   and replay protection.  These security properties are implemented via
   S/MIME and between elements.  Protection for the LO includes any
   attached authorization rules.

   Protection is likely to be necessary against adversaries who
   eavesdrop on the communication between the LS and the LR or the LG
   and the LS, who tamper with the location object or who replay
   previously recorded LOs.  Securing the communication between rule
   maker and the LS depends on the protocol which is used to perform the
   desired actions (e.g., https).  The communication between the LG and
   the LS can also be secured using channel security.

   If the LO is integrity and confidentiality-protected then the
   receiving entity (LS or LR) has to be able to decrypt and to verify
   the LO.  Since the policy rules described in this document allow the
   modification of the LO (via granularity reduction or by setting
   flags), it is not possible to forward the LO without reapplying the
   cryptographic protection.  This is particularly true for the LS as it
   is not the final consumer of the LO.

   When the LS protects the LO for transmission to the LR (after
   successful authorization), then the authenticated identity can be
   used to select a security association to apply proper protection of
   the location object.  Securing the LO for multiple LRs is not
   provided.

   Instead of encrypting the LO, the LG could digitally sign the LO,



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


   offering integrity, but no confidentiality.  However, if the LS needs
   to perform modifications on the LO, then it would have to break the
   digital signature and may apply its own digital signature.

   Since the LO is generally distributed to more than one LR, the LG
   lacks the necessary information about the recipient and thus cannot
   usually apply confidentially protections.

   By default, the LS re-signs LOs if the signed LO has been modified
   according to the rule set.  If the LS receives an LO that it cannot
   decrypt, it discards it if and only if the rule requires modification
   of the content.

   It remains for further study whether there should be an action that
   discards an LO that is signed or encrypted and needs to be modified
   according to the matching rule set.

4.4 Extensions

   The format is meant to be extensible.  Each new extension needs to
   define a new namespace for its conditions and actions.  A
   rule-enforcing entity MUST drop any rules where one or more of the
   <applies-to> elements or actions has an unknown namespace.  It SHOULD
   simply ignore any transformations with unknown elements.

   This behavior is privacy-safe since it prevents adding any
   permissions where the rule enforcer would not test for a particular
   condition.  Consider an example:  If a condition "Dow Jones
   Industrial Average" is added and a rule enforcer would ignore this
   condition, a watcher may obtain additional information even though
   the stock market condition is not met.  Similarly, rules with unknown
   actions must be dropped since these actions may provide additional
   privacy protections, such as logging.  Omitting transformations is
   safe, however, since this will only prevent the inclusion of data.

4.5 Identification

   Each rule has an identifier, using the 'id' parameter of the rule
   element, which serves the purpose of partial updates as mentioned in
   Section 4.2. The identifier is an opaque token chosen by the
   rulemaker.  A rule maker MUST NOT use the same identifier for two
   rules that are available to the LS at the same time for a given
   target. The combination <target identity, rule-id> uniquely
   identifies a rule.

4.6 Conditions

   Conditions are identified by the <applies-to> element in a rule. In



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


   all cases, conditions elements that are missing or empty are treated
   as if they contain a NULL value and always match.

4.6.1 Identity of the requestor (URI)

   Location recipients are identified by URIs and matched by string
   matching on the <uri> element.  Matching rules are governed by the
   URI scheme.

   For some using protocols, the identity is encoded in the URI. It does
   not have to be the same identity that the protocol-specific
   authentication mechanism uses. For example, SIP URIs are sufficient
   to describe a requestor, but the user name for the SIP Digest
   authentication may differ from that identifier.  (Some domains, for
   example, only require a name as the user identifier, while other use
   the full user@host form.)

   For HTTP, the user name is not encoded in the URI. Thus, we define a
   new pseudo-URI scheme, http-auth, that carries the user name found in
   the authentication operation. For example,
   http-auth:alice@example.com.

   It is left to the URI scheme and the using protocol to designate an
   identifier that denotes an 'anonymous user', i.e., a user that has
   not authenticated themselves. This allows to restrict anonymous
   access to users of a particular protocol, for example.

   As an example, SIP can use the anonymous Digest authentication
   mechanism to grant access to holders of a particular secret.  The
   rule sip:anonymous:myticket@anonymous.invalid would then match a
   requestor that includes the 'secret' myticket in the password part of
   the SIP request URI.  This requires no special capabilities in the
   ruleset described here.

   The definition of pseudonyms is left to each URI scheme and the
   related using protocol and any domain that it implies.  For example,
   in SIP, a pseudonym might be 'sip:user42@coldmail.example', assuming
   that coldmail.example offers pseudonym accounts.

   Anonymous users are treated by omitting this attribute in the rule
   which causes a 'NULL' value to be created in the ruleset table of a
   relational database. Any request for a location object (for a given
   target) would match with respect to this attribute in a rule.

4.6.2 Validity

   The rule validity period is expressed as a two elements, a starting
   and ending time.  Times are expressed in XML schema dateTime format.



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


   An example of a rule fragment is shown below:


     <valid-from>2003-08-15T10:20:00.000-05:00</valid-from>
     <valid-until>2003-09-15T10:20:00.000-05:00</valid-until>


4.6.3 Sphere

   The rule matches only if the target is currently in the state
   indicated.  The state may be conveyed by manual configuration of the
   LS or by some protocol.  For example, RPID provides the LG with the
   ability to inform the LS of its current sphere.  The 'sphere' element
   is an XML schema token.  An example of a rule fragment is shown
   below:


     <sphere>work</work>


4.6.4 Civil Location

   The Civil Location matches if the current civil location of the
   target matches all elements in the description given in the rule.

   The civil location match includes a number of fields, including the
   timezone, the country (expressed as a two-letter ISO 3166 code), and
   the administrative units of [12] A1 through A6.  This designation
   offers street-level precision.

   If the civil location of the target is not known, rules that contain
   a civil location never match.  (This case may occur, for example, if
   location information has been removed by earlier transmitters of
   location information or if only the geospatial location is known.)

   If any of the elements <a1> through <a6> are specified, <country>
   also MUST to be specified.  The schema does not enforce that the
   specification uniquely identifies a particular location.  For
   example, it would be possible to omit the region and match only on
   city name, so that any city sharing that name within a country would
   match. This 'feature' is primarily designed to deal with users that
   may not know the administrative divisions between country and city
   level.  For example, many users may not know the county for cities in
   the United States.

   An example of a civil location condition fragment is shown below:

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


     <country>US</country>
     <a1>NJ</a1>
     <a2>Bergen</a2>
     <a3>Leonia</a3>
     <a6>Westview</a6>


4.6.5 Geospatial Location

   The geospatial location conditions make the rule apply if the target
   is currently located within the area bounded by a set of two
   longitude (longitude1, longitude2) and two latitude (latitude1,
   latitude2) values, describing a spherical trapezoid.

   These four elements define a spherical trapezoid that is
   characterized as follows: the northern boundary of the spherical
   trapezoid is on the latitude given by the latitude1 element, and the
   southern boundary is on the latitude given by the latitude2 element -
   the western boundary is on the longitude given by the longitude1
   element, and the eastern boundary is on the longitude given by the
   longitude2 element.

4.7 Conditions

   Conditions are in conjunctive normal form, i.e., all defined elements
   in the rule have to match the query.  It is possible to leave some
   attributes within a row empty or omit the element altogether; these
   attributes then assume the default value of NULL.  NULL entries
   always match.

   Expressed in database terms, queries on the rule set can be modeled
   as SELECT queries, as in


     SELECT permission1,permission2, ... FROM ruleset
     WHERE (condition1='p1' OR condition1 IS NULL)
     AND (condition2='p2' OR condition2 IS NULL)
     AND (...)

   Here, p1, p2, etc.  are properties of the querier, time of day or
   properties of the target, such as its current location.  The
   attributes available for these conditions are described in Section
   4.6.  After determining the rules which fire for a given query the
   permissions have to be combined.  Combining the permissions is
   described in Section 7 and leads to a final result which is applied
   to the location object.

   Expressed in programming terms, the process of determining a result



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


   can be written as (the first part represents the query):


     for each policy rule in ruleset do {
       if ((condition1 == 'p1' || condition1 == NULL)
         && (condition2 == 'p2' || condition2 == NULL)
         ,..
       then {
         collect permissions and add them to the firing-ruleset
       } // end if
     } // end for
     result = Apply permission-combining algorithm on firering-ruleset
     Transform location object based on result

   Conditions can be of four datatypes:

      a string (e.g. civil location)

      an integer

      a date (e.g. validity)

   Naturally, sets are equivalent from an implementation perspective to
   integers.

   In addition to the equality operator, range operators ("is between"),
   set intersection and inequality operators are also supported.  Only
   one type of operator is defined for each element.

4.8 Procedure for combining Permissions

   This section describes the procedure for combining permissions in
   case that multiple rules fire.  As indicated in Section 2 permissions
   are additive i.e. a LR obtains permissions of multiple firing rules.
   The assumption is made that the attributes are ordered and that the
   value of one attribute does not depend on the value of another
   (different) attribute.

   Combining permissions depends on the following four datatypes:

      undefined (NULL)

      an integer or enumeration

      a boolean (true or false)

   A query will be matched against all rules and any number of rules
   might fire.  The permissions of all fireing rules are combined



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


   according to permission-specific combining rules.  The combining
   rules are simple and depend on the datatype:

   Boolean: If any boolean row for a transformation is true, the result
      is true.  If all rows are either undefined or false, the result is
      false.

   Integer or enumeration: The result is the maximum across all rows.
      If all rows are 'NULL', the interpretation depends on the
      permission type.

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


5. Access Control for Policies

   Each rule set is logically associated with exactly one target; we can
   consider this target to be another condition column in the rule set.
   A single rule maker can manage rule sets for a large number of
   targets, and a location server can be provided with rules for
   different targets by different rule makers.

   Access restrictions to the rule set itself are beyond the scope of
   this document.  A complete geo-privacy system would need to specify
   how a location server can verify the identity and authorization of a
   rule maker to insert, update or delete a particular rule.

   A simple mechanism, followed in XCAP Section 2, restricts
   modifications to the target itself, but third-party authorizations
   are likely to be useful.

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


6. Actions

   Actions describe what the recipient of the rule is allowed to do if
   the rule matches.  Note that subscriptions are automatically allowed
   for any subscriber that matches a ruleset, possibly after
   confirmation.  To refuse a subscription, the rulemaker simply omits
   the undesirable subscriber from the ruleset.

   Actions that modify the location object have a default value of NULL.
   The behavior of NULL actions differs for parts of the LO describing
   the location and parts of the LO describing usage rules. For the
   former, only components that are explicitly included through non-NULL
   actions are kept by the LS. For the usage rules, elements are left
   unchanged unless a non-NULL action modifies the rule.

   This approach ensures that extensions in the capabilities of the
   location server do not suddenly change the behavior of the location
   server for the same rule set.  The behavior is also
   privacy-preserving, under the assumption that removing location
   objects can only enhance privacy and that keeping unknown usage rules
   also does not diminuish privacy.

   The operations defined in Section 4.8 are also applicable in this
   context if multiple rules fire.

6.1 Subscription Duration

   The Subscription Duration action only applies to event-based or
   presence systems.  It indicates the duration, measured in seconds,
   that the watcher is allowed to subscribe to this event.  This action
   is ignored for queries.  The default value is 3600 seconds (one
   hour).

6.2 Confirm Subscription

   This action only applies to using protocols that follow a
   subscription model.

   If the Confirm Subscription flag is set, the principal whose
   information is being desired has to approve the subscription.  The
   subscription is marked as 'pending' while the server waits for the
   presentity to decide.  The approval mechanism depends on the using
   protocol and is beyond the scope of this document.  As an example,
   SIP defines a mechanism where the presentity is notified of the
   subscription attempt [cite] and then updates the ruleset to either
   allow or refuse the subscription.

   It is an error if both the Confirm Subscription and Subscription

   Duration action are non-null.

   The default value for this attribute is 'true'.

7. Transformations

   In addition to the transformations below, LS MAY translate and add
   location information.  For example, they may add timezone information
   based on civil information.

   All transformations are privacy-safe, i.e., if a transformation is
   NULL (i.e., if the attribute is not present or empty in a policy
   rule), the LS removes the corresponding location information from the
   LO and leaves the LO flags undisturbed.

   Extensions to this document may define other transformations.

7.1 Set D (Distribute) Flag

   This transformation sets the D flag in the location object to either
   'true' or 'false'.  A value of 'true' means the recipient of the LO
   is allowed to further distribute it.  A value of 'false' prevents
   further distribution.

   The value NULL keeps the D flag in the LO as is.

7.2 Set R (Retention) Time

   The retention transformation sets the retention value in the location
   object to the current time plus the time provided in the element,
   measured in seconds.

   The value NULL keeps the retention time in the LO as is.

7.3 Keep Rule (RR)

   If the Keep Rule (RR) flag is set, any extended rules included in the
   location object are kept.

7.4 Provide Civil Location

   The Provide Civil Location transformation restricts the civil
   location to one of six levels, from lowest to highest:  null,
   country, region, city, building, full.  Each level includes all
   elements included by the lower levels.  The 'country' level includes
   only the <country> element; the 'region' level adds the <a1> element;
   the 'city' level adds the <a2> and <a3> elements; the 'building'
   level and the 'full' level add further civil location data as shown
   below.

   If this action is NULL, all civil information is removed from the LO.

                               {}



7.5 Provide Geospatial Location

   The Provide Geospatial Location transformation restricts the
   resolution of the geospatial location information to the number of
   bits provided, separately for longitude and latitude.  The default
   value is zero.

   For purposes of this transformation, longitude and latitude are
   treated as a 34 bit fixed point value consisting of 9 bits of integer
   and 25 bits of fraction.  Altitude is treated as a fixed-point 22-bit
   integer part with a 8-bit fraction, measured in meters.  This
   corresponds to the representation in [7], but does not constrain the
   representation in the location object.

   If the transformation value is NULL, all geospatial location
   information is removed from the LO.

7.6 Provide Timezone Flag

   The Provide Timezone transformation includes the timezone of the
   target, i.e., the offset from UTC.  The value of 'false' causes
   timezone information to be excluded from the LO.

8. Example

   This section lists some basic examples to show the functionality.

8.1 Example for a rule

   This example rule illustrates a ruleset with a single rule.  The rule
   consists of three parts:  an <applies-to> part which represents the
   conditions, an <action> part and a <transformations> part.  The
   conditions match to a location requestor named alice@example.com.
   The rule is valid for one month (2003-08-15 to 2003-09-15).  Requests
   only match if the target has set its sphere identifier to "work" and
   it is currently located at the indicated civil location.  The
   <transformations> indicate that the granularity of the location
   information is reduced for both civil and for geospatial location
   information.  The D flag is set to 'true' and the rules included in
   the LO are kept.


   <ruleset>
     <rule id="1234567890">
       <applies-to>
         <uri>pres:alice@example.com</uri>

9. XML Schema

   This section describes an XML schema for the authorization policies
   described in the previous sections.  It does not extend other
   schemas. It is a preliminary version primarily to show the simplicity
   of the policies.  In [5] the XML schema in the XCAP Usages for
   Setting Presence Authorization draft [4] to have a better alignment
   with policies used in SIP presence.  It is expected that future
   versions of [4] will experience some changes.  We do not abandon
   either one of the approaches.

10. Security Considerations

   This document aims to make it simple for users to prevent the
   unintended disclosure of private information to third parties.  The
   described policies accomplish this task.  Threats applicable to this
   draft are described in [3] and requirements are addressed in [2].
   Section 4.3 addresses issues of protecting the policy rules within
   the LO and location information itself.  Aspects of privacy-safe
   combining permissions is illustrated in Section 7.

11. Open Issues

   Some open issues have been identified during the process of working
   on this draft:

   Transformation: A default behavior for transformation attributes (see
      Section 7) has to be defined to indicate what behavior has to be
      assumed for omitted values (i.e. for values how appear as 'NULL'
      values in an attribute of row. Currently it seems that it is not
      sufficient to specify a single default behavior rule for all
      transformation attributes in order for them to be privacy-safe.
      Instead at least a differentiation between

         Attributes whose removal may lessen privacy (the R/D/microwave
         flags) and

         Attributes whose removal can only increase privacy (location
         objects).

   Extensions: More text needs to be provided on how to deal with
      extensions and version conflicts.

   Logging: Functionality for triggering logging has been started with
      [14] and continued in [5]. For this draft it was decided not to
      provide encryption and logging functionality as part of the policy
      rules. For logging a simple mechanism would be to just have this
      be a binary flag. It is then up to the LS to decide where to log
      this and how. One problem with logging is that it does not apply
      if the rule set is included in the LO. Asking the LR to log the
      information is meaningless in most cases since the target/RM would
      not be able to access this information. While logging seems
      simple, it also causes interactions with the retention mechanism.
      If someone sends a LO that says "do no retain" and "log", you have
      a problem. Additionally, you may want to specify exactly what gets
      logged: Just the fact that user A got location information at a
      certain time? The precise location information he did get, after
      filtering? Just the fact that location information was distributed
      to some set of users, which you can derive by looking at the rule
      set? Finally, logging would be done in general for each target,
      not just for one recipient. Hence there is a question why it
      should be done based on one particular rule.

   Encryption: For encryption similar concerns are applicable as for
      logging. It needs to be decided whether encryption should be
      handled on a per-rule basis and whether a single flag would be
      sufficient. Some further issues deserve attention such as:





Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires April 19, 2004                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft            Geopriv Policy Rules              October 2003


         What happens if the public key is not known for the recipient?

         What encryption technique should I use?

         Should an identity be provided within the rule?

         What happens if this identity specifies a SIPS URI (i.e.,
         requiring that the request be via SIP-over-TLS) and the flag is
         not set, should it be refused?

         If encryption is specified and the request was HTTP (not
         HTTPS), should the request be refused?

   Identities: A number of issues have been discussed with regard to
      identities of the LR (specified in the URI attribute).

   Authentication Types: Element E (Permission to disclose only to
      someone presenting a specified key) of [14] was implemented in [5]
      as authentication levels (see Section 2.1 in ). [4] specifies the
      elements <auth-mechanism> and <anonymous> inside the acceptance
      permission which allows to refer to SIP specific authentication
      mechanisms such as None, TLS, Digest, SMIME and P-Asserted-ID. For
      this draft is was decided to omit these attributes since they
      might be difficult to understand for end users, difficult to
      realize since authentication levels are not universally defined
      and in case of specific authentication mechanisms it is difficult
      to imply the meaning for Geopriv.

   Notifications: A concept which appears to be simple is to require
      notice to the rule maker if location is provided (Element K of
      [14]. The concept of 'notice' might be meaningless without saying
      how. Currently there is no such mechanism define in Geopriv and
      therefore there are no parameters which might be needed for this
      operation.There are certainly many possible protocols on how to
      notify the RM, including event notification (using SIP, Jabber,
      SOAP events, etc.), email, some kind of RPC mechanism, an HTTP
      request to a specific address, syslog. Currently we think that
      this issues deserves further discussion.

   Permission-Combining Example: An example describing the
      permission-combining algorithm has to be provided for Section 8.
      Working on this example the concept of a 'default' rule was
      discussed. The term default rule refers to a rule where the
      condition elements are all set to 'NULL'. This rule will fire with
      every query.

   Lying: Functionality for lying by the LS is not supported.

   A number of other minor issues are still buried in the drafts [5],
   [14] and in [4].

   participants. We would to particularly thank Jon Peterson for his
   helpful comments. Additionally, we would like to thank Christian
   Guenther for his work on the XML schema.
