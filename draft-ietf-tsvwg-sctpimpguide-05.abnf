   E) Then, the sender can send out as many new DATA chunks as Rule A
      and Rule B above allow.

   o  When cwnd is less than or equal to ssthresh an SCTP endpoint MUST
      use the slow start algorithm to increase cwnd (assuming the
      current congestion window is being fully utilized).  If an
      incoming SACK advances the Cumulative TSN Ack Point, cwnd MUST be
      increased by at most the lesser of 1) the total size of the
      previously outstanding DATA chunk(s) acknowledged, and 2) the
      destination's path MTU. This protects against the ACK-Splitting
      attack outlined in [SAVAGE99].

   o  When cwnd is less than or equal to ssthresh an SCTP endpoint MUST
      use the slow start algorithm to increase cwnd only if the
      current congestion window is being fully utilized and an
      incoming SACK advances the Cumulative TSN Ack Point. Only when
      these two conditions are met can the cwnd be increased otherwise
      the cwnd MUST not be increased. If these conditions are met then
      cwnd MUST be increased by at most the lesser of 1) the total 
      size of the previously outstanding DATA chunk(s) acknowledged, 
      and 2) the destination's path MTU. This protects against the 
      ACK-Splitting attack outlined in [SAVAGE99].

   o  When the endpoint does not transmit data on a given transport
      address, the cwnd of the transport address should be adjusted to
      max(cwnd/2, 2*MTU) per RTO.
