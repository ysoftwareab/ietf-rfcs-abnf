3. Introduction  
           
   [VPIM2] does not place any restrictions on the email address format. 
   However, it does RECOMMEND to use a numeric LHS since many legacy 
   voice mail systems only use digits to identify mailboxes. Further, 
   it RECOMMENDS a structure to handle private, international and 
   extensions. The private format has become deployed in most existing 
   VPIM v2 systems, further some systems will only accept messages from

   addresses with a numeric LHS.  
    
   [IVM] does not describe addressing at all. The LHS format is left to 
   the discretion of the mailbox owner. However, it is useful in some 
   cases (like submission or tunneling) to specify a LHS format. A 
   format based on GSTN addressing [GSTN] is presented.  
    
    
4. VPIM v2 Addressing 
    
   This is defined in section 4.1.1 of [VPIMv2], but is repeated here 
   for convenience: 
    
   4.1.1 VPIM Addressing 
       
      The local part of the address shall be a US-ASCII string uniquely 
      identifying a mailbox on a destination system.  For voice 
      messaging, the local part is a printable string containing the 
      mailbox ID of the originator or recipient.  While alpha 
      characters and long mailbox identifiers are permitted, most voice 
      mail networks rely on numeric mailbox identifiers to retain 
      compatibility with the limited 10-digit telephone keypad.  As a 
      result, some voice messaging systems may only be able to handle a 
      numeric local part.  The reception of alphanumeric local parts on 
      these systems may result in the address being mapped to some 
      locally unique (but confusing to the recipient) number or, in the 
      worst case the address could be deleted making the message 
      unreplyable.  Additionally, it may be difficult to create 
      messages on these systems with an alphanumeric local part without 
      complex key sequences or some form of directory lookup (see 
      [VPIMV2R2] section 6).  
        
      The use of the Domain Name System should be transparent to the 
      user.  It is the responsibility of the voice mail machine to 
      lookup the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) based on the 
      address entered by the user (see [VPIMV2R2] section 6). 
       
      In the absence of a global directory, specification of the local 
      part is expected to conform to international or private telephone 
      numbering plans.  It is likely that private numbering plans will 
      prevail and these are left for local definition.  However, it is 
      RECOMMENDED that public telephone numbers be noted according to 
      the international numbering plan described in [E.164]. The 
      indication that the local part is a public telephone number is 
      given by a preceding `+' (the `+' would not be entered from a 
      telephone keypad, it is added by the system as a flag).  Since 
      the primary information in the numeric scheme is contained by the 
      digits, other character separators (e.g. `-') may be ignored 
      (i.e. to allow parsing of the numeric local mailbox) or may be 
      used to recognize distinct portions of the telephone number (e.g. 
      country code).  The specification of the local part of a VPIM 
      address can be split into the four groups described below: 
       
      1) mailbox number 
         - for use as a private numbering plan (any number of digits) 
         - e.g.  2722@lucent.com 
       
      2) mailbox number+extension 
         - for use as a private numbering plan with extensions

                           VPIM Addressing            November 16 2000 

           any number of digits, use of `+' as separator 
         - e.g.  2722+111@Lucent.com 
       
      3) +international number 
         - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164 
           maximum of 15 digits 
         - e.g.  +16137637582@vm.nortel.ca 
       
      4) +international number+extension 
         - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164 
           maximum of 15 digits, with an extension (e.g. behind a 
           PBX) that has a maximum of 15 digits.  
         - e.g.  +17035245550+230@ema.org 
       
      Note that this address format is designed to be compatible with 
      current usage within the voice messaging industry.  It is not 
      compatible with the addressing formats of RFCs 2303-2304.  It is 
      expected that as telephony services become more widespread on the 
      Internet, these addressing formats will converge.  
            
    
5. VPIM Addressing 
 
   VPIM places no restrictions on the form of the Internet address. 
   VPIM systems must be capable of receiving an arbitrary email address 
   and generating a reply to that address. No inferences about the 
   structure of the local part (LHS) should be necessary.  
           
   Recipients email addresses must be created in a form compatible with 
   the recipients system and consistent with the address entry 
   capabilities of a telephone user interface. 
    
   The following sections use formal syntax compliant with RFC 2234, 
   "Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF". 
    
            
           
5.1 VPIM Submission LHS   
           
   Limited capability voice mail machines may send messages by default 
   to an external message submission gateway.  These gateways will 
   convert the unresolved telephone number of the recipient into a 
   legitimate email address.  Messages requiring address resolution 
   must be sent to a submission system which will convert the submitted 
   address into the route-able email address.   
    
   Additionally, limited capability email systems may send messages to 
   a VPIM onramp system indicated on the RHS. The LHS would indicate 
   that the message is to be sent as a VPIM message to the telephone 
   number indicated. In this case, address and message translation is 
   performed by the gateway.  
           
   Telephone numbers sent in a VPIM submission mode MUST be sent in one 
   of the following forms.  
           
   This is based on the format defined in [GSTN-ADDR] and extensions in 
   [GSTN].

                           VPIM Addressing            November 16 2000 

5.1.1 The VPIM address  
    
   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as VPIM messages the  
   service-selector element is defined to be: 
    
   vpim-service-selector = "VPIM"  
    
   The resultant vpim-address and vpim-mbox are formally  
           
   vpim-address = vpim-mbox  
                 [ pstn-recipient ]  
           
   vpim-mbox = [ "VPIM=" ] ( global-phone / local-phone )  
               [ sub-addr-spec ext-addr-spec dl-addr-spec]  
    
   dl-addr-spec = "/DL=" sub-addr  
                         ;note that "/DL=" is case INSENSITIVE              
   ext-addr-spec = [ ext-sep sub-addr ]  
   ext-sep = ( "/EXT=" / "+" )  
                         ; note that "/EXT=" is case INSENSITIVE  
                         ; "+" is used for compatibility with current  
                         ; VPIM v2 addressing  
           
   For clarity, here is an example of a very simple vpim-mbox:  
        VPIM=6137637582  
    
   The extension syntax, that is a phone number followed by "/EXT=" 
   defining the extension, would be used where the mailbox does not 
   have a direct dial number associated with it (e.g., typically behind 
   a non-ISDN PBX).   For example: 
    
        VPIM=7035255550/EXT=227 
    
   The distribution list syntax, that is a phone number followed by 
   "/DL=" defining the list, would be used to refer to a distribution 
   list associated with the phone number (with or without an 
   extension).  For example: 
    
    
        VPIM=+14165977230/DL=93  
    
           
           
5.1.2 The Voice address  
           
   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as a voice 
   outdialing at the destination system, the service-selector element 
   is defined to be:       
    
   voice-service-selector = "VOICE"  
           
   The resultant voice-address and voice-mbox are formally  
           
   voice-address = voice-mbox  
                  [ pstn-recipient ]  
           
   voice-mbox = "VOICE=" ( global-phone / local-phone )  
                      [ sub-addr spec ] [post-sep post-dial]

   For more clarity, here is an example of a very simple voice-mbox:  
           
   VOICE=+3940226338  
           
           
5.1.3 The AMIS address  
           
   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as AMIS (Audio 
   Messaging Interchange Specification) voice mail messages, the 
   service-selector element is defined to be:   
    
   amis-service-selector = "AMIS"  
           
   The resultant amis-address and amis-mbox are formally  
           
   amis-address = amis-mbox  
          
   amis-mbox = "AMIS=" amis-mailbox   
               [ "/SYSNUM=" amis-sysnum ]  
               ; note that "/SYSNUM=" is case INSENSITIVE  
           
   amis-mailbox = ( amis-a / amis-d )  
           
   amis-a = amis-a-number  
           
   amis-d = [ amis-mailbox-numberplan ][ "+" ] amis-mailbox-id   
               [ "+" ] [ amis-mailbox-extension ]  
               ; The "+" separators are used to be compatible   
               ; the X.400 AMIS-D mailbox definition --   
               ; if more than one element is present, both  
               ; "+" must appear.  Note also that the total  
               ; length of this field is restricted to 32  
               ; characters by AMIS-D.

   As defined in [FAX-ADDR],section 2. 
    
    
5.2 VPIM Submission Addresses  
              
   Based on RFC2303, these are the resultant email addresses for the 
   LHS presented above.  VPIM and IVM  systems that support submission 
   MUST accept, translate (if necessary), and forward messages sent to 
   these addresses.   
                
           
5.2.1 The vpim-email  
               
   The vpim-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for VPIM 
   over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-
   selector distinction is set to "VPIM". 
    
   vpim-email =  ["/"] vpim-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                
   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a VPIM capable   
   messaging system where the attached message will be delivered 
   properly.  
                
           
5.2.2 The voice-email  
               
   The voice-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the 
   voice outdialing over the Internet e-mail transport system, where 
   the service-selector distinction is set to "VOICE".  
    
   voice-email =  ["/"] voice-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                
   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that will 
   perform an outdial, that is for example, make a telephone call to 
   the specified number and play a voice attachment.  
                
           
5.2.3 The amis-email  
           
   The amis-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the 
   AMIS over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-
   selector distinction is set to "AMIS".  
    
   amis-email =  ["/"] amis-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn

                           VPIM Addressing            November 16 2000 

   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that acts 
   as a gateway to an AMIS network where the attached voice message 
   will be delivered properly.              
           
 
5.2.4 The fax-email  
                
   As defined in [FAX-ADDR], section 4. 
    
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
 
   Most security considerations are already identified in [VPIM2] and 
   [IVM].  
    
   An additional concern would be that the sender must trust and also 
   be aware of the policies of the submission MTA to which the message 
   is submitted.  This is because, that MTA will make the determination 
   of where the final destination is and how it will be delivered based 
   on the VPIM submission LHS.  
    
    
7. IANA Considerations
