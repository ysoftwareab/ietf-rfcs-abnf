                           APONF Architecture
                    draft-zhou-aponf-architecture-00

Abstract

   Currently, there are transport applications that have specific 
   demands on a communication network. This document describes the APONF 
   basic architecture, its elements and interfaces. The main APONF 
   architecture entity is the Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD), 
   which supports groups/classes of application models. Each of these 
   models supports application demands that are similar in nature and 
   therefore can be grouped/classified together. Moreover, the ABPD maps 
   the classified application models into network capabilities, 
   e.g., network management and traffic policies.

1.  Introduction

   As the Internet grows, more and more new services keep on arising, 
   and network traffic is rapidly increased, which may result in slow
   performance of network devices (e.g., BRAS) and poor end-user
   experience. In addition, especially for cloud applications, the
   cloud tenants and developers usually need to use the communication 
   network capabilities, such as dynamic network management and dynamic 
   traffic steering, easily, accurately and efficiently.   
   In this way, the deployment of new applications and services may be 
   accelerated and the user experience can be improved.

   There are transport applications, see e.g., 
   [ID.montpetit-transport-use-cases], that have specific and real time 
   demands on the communication network. In particular, these 
   demands require the use of specific network management and traffic 
   policies which are currently not directly provided by the 
   communication network to these applications. This introduces 
   difficulties for the applications to use these network capabilities 
   efficiently and may cause user experience degradation, e.g., 
   congestion and delay. It is therefore, required that the 
   communication network manages and/or controls the application traffic 
   according to the requirements imposed by the application.

Internet-Draft         APONF architecture                    June 2014

   The application's demands on a communication network may be 
   different, but there are several application demands that may be 
   similar, such as Web Surfing/Browsing applications, IoT 
   applications, virtual network function services, which can be 
   grouped/classified together. The classified application demands on a 
   communication network can be presented and modeled as classified 
   application-based policies. A set of application-based policy models 
   may be needed for auto-mapping of application's demands to existing 
   network management and/or traffic policies.

   This will allow applications to use the network capabilities in a 
   more accurate and efficient way.    
   The main goal of this document is to specify the APONF basic 
   architecture, its elements and interfaces. The main APONF 
   architecture entity is the Application-based Policy 
   Decision (ABPD), which supports classified application models. 
   The Application-based Policy Decision entity provides an interface to
   the application to generate the classified application models and
   to map these models to the network management and traffic policies 
   that can be used by the communication network. The definition of 
   these network management and traffic policies is out of the APONF 
   scope. 

2.  Terminology

   VNF (Virtualized Network Function): An implementation of an
   executable software program that constitutes the whole or a part of
   an NF and can be deployed on a virtualisation infrastructure.

   TAPS (Transport Services): The main goal of this activity (currently 
   BOF) is to provide the means to applications to specify the services 
   they can receive from the transport protocol, but

   NFVcon (Network Functions Virtualization configuration): The main 
   goal of this activity (BOF status) is to support the dynamic 
   configuration of NFV instances.

   AECON (Application Enabled Collaborative Network): The main goal of 
   the AECON activity (currently BOF) is to allow applications to 
   explicitly signal their flow characteristics to the network.

   Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN): The main goal 
   of this activity is to enable discussion of the architecture, use-
   cases, and requirements that provide abstraction and virtual control 
   of transport networks to various applications.

3.  Overview of the APONF Architecture

   This section depicts an overview of the architecture of application-
   based policy on network functions. Figure 1 shows the basic 
   architecture of the application-based policy on network functions. 
   The entities used in the APONF architecture are:

   O) Application: A transport application that needs to observe the
      network or manipulate the network to achieve its service
      requirements.  Several applications may communicate with the
      Application Based Policy Decision block. 

   O) Application Based Policy Decision (ABPD): A functional entity 
      Which provides an interface to the application to generate the 
      grouped/classified application models and to map these models to 
      existing network management and traffic policies that can be used 
      by the communication network. It can communicate with multiple 
      applications simultaneously.

       Figure 1: Architecture of application-based policy on network
                                 functions


   o) Network Element (NE): A NE handles incoming packets based on the
      policy information communicated with the applications and enforces
      the corresponding network management and traffic manipulation. 

4.  Transport Applications

   The Transport Architecture entity represents transport applications. 
   This architecture is expected to be used for several categories of
   transport applications, e.g., Web Surfing/Browsing, Streaming Video,
   Real-time Communications, Data storage, etc.  

Zhou, et al.            Expires December 6, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         APONF architecture                    June 2014

   These transport Applications provide a set of application-based 
   policy models which are imposing similar network management and 
   traffic policy requirements on the communication network.  
   The application's demands on the network may be different, but some 
   application's demands on the communication network may be similar, 
   and can be grouped/classified together. Such similar application's 
   demands can be: Web Surfing/Browsing applications, IoT 
   applications, virtual network function services, etc. The classified 
   application demands on a communication network can be presented and 
   modeled as classified application-based policies and models. 

   The traditional applications can communicate real time, using an
   existing interface, e.g., netconf, restconf, or some new protocols 
   proposed by interested parties, with the transport applications and 
   exchange information requested by the Application-Based Policy 
   Decision entity. The definition of this interface is out of the scope 
   of this document.

   The Transport Applications entity will use the APONF interface to 
   communicate with the Application Based Policy Decision (ABPD) entity. 

5.  Application Based Policy Decision

   The Application-Based Policy Decision (ABPD) block, is a an entity
   used between the Transport Application entity and the network 
   elements to provide and maintain the application-based policies.  It 
   supports the APONF interface/protocol and is a software repository, 
   which stores the information associated with each NE, and maps the 
   classified  application models to existing network management and 
   traffic policies.  In particular, by creating application-based 
   policies that mirror application semantics, a better mapping to 
   existing traffic and network management policies can be realized.  
   This provides a simple, self-documenting mechanism for capturing 
   application-based policy requirements and mapping them to existing 
   traffic and network management policies. This will allow applications 
   to use the network capabilities in a more accurate and efficient way.

   The definition of these network management and traffic policies is 
   out of the APONF scope. Examples of such existing network management 
   and traffic policies that are considered by APONF are the following:

      o) Manage dynamically network semantics (supported by e.g., 
         SNMP/MIB, COPS-PR/PIB, NetConf/Yang, CLI, Web Services/MIB, 
         nfvcon (Network Function Virtualization configuration) 
         activity). 

      o) Orchestrate dynamically virtualized functions (supported by 
         e.g., SCF WG, nfvcon activity, Abstraction and Control of 
         Transport Networks (ACTN) activity).

      o) Permit/Block/Redirect the traffic (supported by e.g., I2RS WG, 
         FORCES WG, Application Enabled Collaborative Network (AECON) 
         activity).

Internet-Draft         APONF architecture                    June 2014

      o) Log the traffic (supported by e.g., I2RS WG, FORCES WG, 
         AECON activity).

      o) Copy the traffic (supported by e.g., I2RS WG, FORCES WG, 
         AECON activity).

      o) Set the traffic (supported for/by e.g., NAT, Firewall, I2RS WG, 
         FORCES WG, AECON 
         activity).

      o) Mark the traffic (supported for/by e.g., Intserv, Diffserv, 
         PCN, MPLS).

   These application-based policy models can meet the application's 
   demands on the communication network and map these demands to network 
   management and traffic policies that can be understood by the 
   communication network. 


6.  Network Elements

   The Network Element (NE) handles incoming packets based on the policy
   information communicated with the ABPD block and makes corresponding
   policy enforcement, which is based on existing network management and 
   traffic policies, see Section 5.
   A NE may be a physical entity or a virtual entity and is locally
   managed, whether via CLI, SNMP, or NeTConf.  Examples of NEs can
   include:

   o  A router that has an extended function module.  The extended
      module handles incoming packets basing on the flow table of the
      module.

   o  A server that runs vRouter or vSwitch.

   o  A CGN that runs NAT, Tunnel En/De-capsulation functions.

   o  A virtual network function (VNF) entity.


7.  The APONF Interface/Protocol

   This APONF Interface/Protocol, needs to be specified by the APONF WG 
   and is used to support the communication between the Transport 
   Application entity and the ABPD entity, see Section 5. 

8.  Security Considerations

   Authentication and authorization mechanisms are needed to ensure that 
   the transport applications communicating with the ABPD entity are 
   indeed authenticated and authorized. Furthermore, the privacy of the 
   end users running the applications that make use of APONF must be 
   protected.
