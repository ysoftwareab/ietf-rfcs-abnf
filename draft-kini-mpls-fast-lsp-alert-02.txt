Internet Draft         A fast LSP-alert Mechanism       January 13, 2011


Abstract          

   There are applications (e.g. fault-management, OAM) that need to
   alert LSRs along an LSP. Currently defined alert mechanisms for
   labeled packets (e.g., TTL expiry, GAL, etc) alert a single LSR along
   the LSP with one alert message. To alert multiple LSRs along the LSP,
   multiple alert messages have to be generated. This results in
   increasing delays in generating the message as the number of LSRs
   increase. If the message is used to recover from faults, it results
   in increasing traffic loss. This document defines a simple and fast
   mechanism that can alert all the LSRs along a LSP.

Internet Draft         A fast LSP-alert Mechanism       January 13, 2011


1.  Introduction

   MPLS defines mechanisms to alert a LSR to perform exception
   processing on a labeled packet. The trigger for the exception
   processing is based on TTL expiry and/or an alert label. OAM
   applications can use these mechanisms to perform application specific
   functions. A typical application is MPLS ping described in [RFC4379].

   Some OAM applications require multiple LSRs along a LSP to be
   alerted. When the application is doing fault recovery it is important
   to deliver the alert message quickly to the LSR(s) that performs the
   recovery action so that traffic loss is minimized. If the message is
   generated as a labeled packet the currently defined alert mechanisms
   can alert only a single LSR along the LSP. When the application
   requires multiple LSRs along the LSP to be alerted, multiple messages
   (one per LSR) must be generated. This causes delays and consequently
   increased traffic loss.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALLNOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Solution

   This solution is designed such that a single message originated by an
   LSR is delivered to multiple LSRs along the LSP. To do this,
   intermediate LSRs have to create a copy of the incoming packet for
   local processing and at the same time forward the packet to another
   LSR. The semantics of the packet processing, encoding and addressing
   to achieve this uses currently defined MPLS mechanisms as much as
   possible.

   A Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is defined in [RFC5586] and can
   be used to encode OAM messages for an LSP. The solution defined in
   this document uses the G-ACh to encode an alert message and defines
   additional mechanisms such that a single G-ACh message is delivered
   to multiple LSRs along the LSP.

   In order to quickly deliver a G-ACh message to multiple LSRs along
   the LSP, the forwarding semantics of a labeled packet on the LSP is
   used. This is combined with the existing MPLS alert mechanism that
   uses TTL expiry. To effect the combined semantics, the TTL in the GAL
   is used to preserve the TTL semantics of MPLS forwarding whereas the
   TTL (expiry) of the LSP label is used to deliver the packet locally.
   A bit in the ACH is used to indicate that the packet has to be
   locally delivered as well as forwarded along the LSP. This bit is

   henceforth referred to as Fast-LSP-Alert bit or FLA-bit. 

   The solution is designed to be simple so that it can be easily
   implemented in hardware. Implementations that are incapable of doing
   this in hardware should implement it in firmware. The details of the
   packet format are described in section 3.1. Packet processing
   procedures are described in section 3.2.

3.1.  Packet Format

   The 16th bit in the ACH is suggested to be defined (by IANA) as the
   FLA-bit and the resultant ACH is shown below

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0 0 0 1|Version|   Reserved  |X|         Channel Type          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   X = FLA-bit

                       Figure 1 ACH with FLA-bit

3.2.  Packet processing

   This section describes the rules for origination, receiving and
   forwarding a G-ACh message with FLA-bit set. It is also illustrated
   via an example in Section 3.3.

3.2.1.  Origination

   When a LSR originates an alert message that has to be delivered to
   multiple LSRs along the LSP, it encodes it as a G-ACh message for the
   LSP (with GAL at the bottom of the stack) and sets the FLA-bit in the
   ACH. In the outer Label (i.e., LSP label) the TTL is set to 1. The
   GAL's TTL SHOULD be set to 255 if all LSRs along the LSP have to be
   alerted. If not all LSRs need to be alerted then the GAL's TTL MUST
   be set to the number of LSRs that need to be alerted.

3.2.2.  Receiving and Forwarding

   When a LSR receives a packet with LSP label's TTL=1 it is identified
   as an alert packet. Since S=0, the next label in the label stack (in
   this case the GAL) is processed. If the GAL's TTL is 0, the packet is
   dropped. Else, the packet is treated as a G-ACh message to be
   processed by the local LSR. All of these processing steps are
   currently defined in MPLS.

   This document defines an additional step when processing the ACH. If
   the FLA-bit is set and the Incoming Label Map (ILM) entry indicates
   that the packet must be forwarded along the LSP, an additional copy
   of the packet MUST be made. For this copy of the packet the GAL's TTL
   is processed as would have been done on an incoming packet's LSP
   label TTL. Following a successful TTL processing, the labeled packet
   (with the LSP label stacked on top of the GAL) is operated in
   accordance with the ILM. An LSP label on the forwarded packet MUST
   continue to have TTL set to 1. Thus the difference in the TTL between
   the incoming and outgoing packet is that the outgoing packet would
   have the GAL's TTL decremented.

                Figure 2 Fast LSP-alert packet traversal


   L1-4 are LSRs and an LSP (LSP1) is routed along L1->L2->L3->L4. L1
   needs to send a message that has to be delivered to LSRs (L2, L3, L4)
   along the LSP. It generates the message in the G-ACh with FLA-bit
   set. In this example the GAL TTL is set to 255. The packet's
   traversal along the LSP's G-ACh is shown in Figure 2. Each of the
   LSRs along the LSP delivers the packet locally as an alert message
   and also sends a copy of the packet (with the GAL TTL decremented)
   along the LSP.

4.  Addressing in ACH TLVs and G-ACh Message

   The mechanism described in this document is independent of any
   addressing scheme of the ACH TLVs or the G-ACh message. Since the
   same message is delivered as an alert packet to multiple LSRs, any
   address that indicates where this message must be processed, must be
   chosen such that it is accepted by each of those LSRs for local
   processing. This document borrows on the requirements in [RFC4379]
   and places the following requirements on addressing:

      1. The likelihood that this alert message is delivered to a user
         of the service should be kept to an absolute minimum.

      2. The alert message must not be forwarded further based on the
         address in the ACH TLVs or the G-ACh message.

   For G-ACh Channel Type IPv4, an address from the 127/8 range should
   be used. For G-ACh Channel Type IPv6 an address from the same range
   embedded in as IPv4-mapped IPv6 address should be used. For
   additional Channel Types, addresses that satisfy the above stated
   requirements should be used.

5.  Applicability to LSP types

   The mechanism described in this document is applicable to point-to-
   point as well as point-to-multipoint TE tunnels that have G-ACh
   (using GAL) enabled. Applicability to other types of LSPs is for
   further study.

6.  Future Work

   If an LSR does not support FLA-bit then it would not make a copy of
   the packet to forward. To address this an LSR that supports the FLA-
   bit and has a neighbor that doesn't, can set the LSP label TTL such
   that it skips such LSRs. If the LSP is statically configured the
   outgoing TTL to be set such that non supporting LSRs are skipped, can
   be configured. If the LSP is signaled then the RRO object can be used
   to detect the number of LSRs to be skipped. Defining the objects and
   procedures to do this is for future study.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC5586] are applicable. An
   additional consideration is loops. That is prevented using the GAL
   TTL.

Internet Draft         A fast LSP-alert Mechanism       January 13, 2011


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should allocate a reserved bit in the ACH as the FLA-bit.

9.  Conclusion

   This document defines a mechanism that by which messages can be
   quickly delivered to multiple LSRs along a LSP. It re-uses currently
   defined MPLS mechanisms and keeps the principles of MPLS forwarding
   intact. A reserved bit in the ACH is defined to enable forwarding a
   copy of the packet. This change is defined to be simple enough to
   enable implementation in hardware or firmware.
