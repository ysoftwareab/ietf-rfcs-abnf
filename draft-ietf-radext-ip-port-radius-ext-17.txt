       RADIUS Extensions for IP Port Configuration and Reporting
                draft-ietf-radext-ip-port-radius-ext-17

Abstract

   This document defines three new RADIUS attributes.  For devices that
   implement IP port ranges, these attributes are used to communicate
   with a RADIUS server in order to configure and report IP transport
   ports, as well as mapping behavior for specific hosts.  This
   mechanism can be used in various deployment scenarios such as
   Carrier-Grade NAT, IPv4/IPv6 translators, Provider WLAN Gateway, etc.
   This document defines a mapping between some RADIUS attributes and
   IPFIX Information Element Identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   In a broadband network, customer information is usually stored on a
   RADIUS server [RFC2865].  At the time when a user initiates an IP
   connection request, if this request is authorized, the RADIUS server
   will populate the user's configuration information to the Network
   Access Server (NAS), which is often referred to as a Broadband
   Network Gateway (BNG) in broadband access networks.  The Carrier-
   Grade NAT (CGN) function may also be implemented on the BNG.  Within
   this document, the CGN may perform NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146],
   or Dual-Stack Lite AFTR [RFC6333] function.  In such case, the CGN IP
   transport port (e.g., TCP/UDP port) mapping(s) behavior(s) can be
   part of the configuration information sent from the RADIUS server to
   the NAS/BNG.  The NAS/BNG may also report to the RADIUS Server the IP
   port mapping behavior applied by the CGN to a user session to the
   RADIUS server, as part of the accounting information sent from the
   NAS/BNG to a RADIUS server.

   When IP packets traverse the CGN, it performs mapping on the IP
   transport (e.g., TCP/UDP) source port as required.  An IP transport
   source port, along with source IP address, destination IP address,
   destination port and protocol identifier if applicable, uniquely
   identify a mapping.  Since the number space of IP transport ports in
   CGN's external realm is shared among multiple users assigned with the
   same IPv4 address, the total number of a user's simultaneous IP
   mappings is likely to be subject to port quota (see Section 5 of
   [RFC6269]).

   The attributes defined in this document may also be used to report
   the assigned port range in some deployments such as Provider WLAN
   [I-D.gundavelli-v6ops-community-wifi-svcs].  For example, a visiting
   host can be managed by a CPE (Customer Premises Equipment ) which
   will need to report the assigned port range to the service platform.
   This is required for identification purposes (see TR-146 [TR-146] for
   more details).

   This document proposes three new attributes as RADIUS protocol's
   extensions, and they are used for separate purposes as follows:

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Extensions for IP Port        November 2016


   1.  IP-Port-Limit-Info: This attribute may be carried in a RADIUS
       Access-Accept, Access-Request, Accounting-Request or CoA-Request
       packet.  The purpose of this attribute is to limit the total
       number of IP source transport ports allocated to a user,
       associated with one or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

   2.  IP-Port-Range: This attribute may be carried in a RADIUS
       Accounting-Request packet.  The purpose of this attribute is for
       an address sharing device (e.g., a CGN) to report to the RADIUS
       server the range of IP source transport ports that have been
       allocated or deallocated for a user.  The port range is bound to
       an external IPv4 address.

   3.  IP-Port-Forwarding-Map: This attribute may be carried in RADIUS
       Access-Accept, Access-Request, Accounting-Request or CoA-Request
       packet.  The purpose of this attribute is to specify how an IP
       internal source transport port together with its internal IPv4 or
       IPv6 address are mapped to an external source transport port
       along with the external IPv4 address.

   IPFIX Information Elements [RFC7012] can be used for IP flow
   identification and representation over RADIUS.  This document
   provides a mapping between some RADIUS TLVs and IPFIX Information
   Element Identifiers.  A new IPFIX Information Element is defined by
   this document (see Section 3.2.2).

   IP protocol numbers (refer to [ProtocolNumbers]) can be used for
   identification of IP transport protocols (e.g., TCP [RFC0793], UDP
   [RFC0768], DCCP [RFC4340], and SCTP [RFC4960]) that are associated
   with some RADIUS attributes.

   This document focuses on IPv4 address sharing.  IPv6 prefix sharing
   mechanisms (e.g., NPTv6) are out of scope.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  IP Port: refers to IP transport port (e.g., TCP port number, UDP
      port number).

   o  IP Port Type: refers to the IP transport protocol as indicated by
      the IP transport protocol number, refer to (refer to
      [ProtocolNumbers])

   o  IP Port Limit: denotes the maximum number of IP ports for a
      specific (or all) IP transport protocol(s), that a device
      supporting port ranges can use when performing port number

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Extensions for IP Port        November 2016


      mappings for a specific user/host.  Note, this limit is usually
      associated with one or more IPv4/IPv6 addresses.

   o  IP Port Range: specifies a set of contiguous IP ports, indicated
      by the lowest numerical number and the highest numerical number,
      inclusively.

   o  Internal IP Address: refers to the IP address that is used by a
      host as a source IP address in an outbound IP packet sent towards
      a device supporting port ranges in the internal realm.  The
      internal IP address may be IPv4 or IPv6.

   o  External IP Address: refers to the IP address that is used as a
      source IP address in an outbound IP packet after traversing a
      device supporting port ranges in the external realm.  This
      document assumes that the external IP address is an IPv4 address.

   o  Internal Port: is an IP transport port, which is allocated by a
      host or application behind an address sharing device for an
      outbound IP packet in the internal realm.

   o  External Port: is an IP transport port, which is allocated by an
      address sharing device upon receiving an outbound IP packet in the
      internal realm, and is used to replace the internal port that is
      allocated by a user or application.

   o  External realm: refers to the networking segment where external IP
      addresses are used as source addresses of outbound packets
      forwarded by an address sharing device.

   o  Internal realm: refers to the networking segment that is behind an
      address sharing device and where internal IP addresses are used.

   o  Mapping: denotes a relationship between an internal IP address,
      internal port and the protocol, and an external IP address,
      external port, and the protocol.

   o  Address sharing device: a device that is capable of sharing an
      IPv4 address among multiple users.  A typical example of this
      device is a CGN, CPE, Provider WLAN Gateway, etc.

3.  Extensions of RADIUS Attributes and TLVs

   These three new attributes are defined in the following sub-sections:

   1.  IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute

   2.  IP-Port-Range Attribute

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Extensions for IP Port        November 2016


   3.  IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute

   All these attributes are allocated from the RADIUS "Extended Type"
   code space per [RFC6929].

   These attributes and their embedded TLVs (refer to Section 3.2) are
   defined with globally unique names and follow the guideline in
   Section 2.7.1 of [RFC6929].

   In all the figures describing the RADIUS attributes and TLV formats
   in the following sub-sections, the fields are transmitted from left
   to right.

3.1.  Extended Attributes for IP Ports

3.1.1.  IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute

   This attribute is of type "TLV" as defined in the RADIUS Protocol
   Extensions [RFC6929].  It contains some sub-attributes and the
   requirement is as follows:

   o  The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-Type TLV
      (see Section 3.2.1).

   o  The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute MUST contain the IP-Port-Limit
      TLV (see Section 3.2.2).

   o  The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-Ext-
      IPv4-Addr TLV (see Section 3.2.3).

   The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute specifies the maximum number of IP
   ports as indicated in IP-Port-Limit TLV, of a specific IP transport
   protocol as indicated in IP-Port-Type TLV, and associated with a
   given IPv4 address as indicated in IP-Port-Ext-IPv4-Addr TLV for an
   end user.

   Note that when IP-Port-Type TLV is not included as part of the IP-
   Port-Limit-Info Attribute, the port limit applies to all IP transport
   protocols.

   Note also that when IP-Port-Ext-IPv4-Addr TLV is not included as part
   of the IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute, the port limit applies to all
   the IPv4 addresses managed by the address sharing device, e.g., a CGN
   or NAT64 device.

   The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in an Access-Request packet as a

   preferred maximum number of IP ports indicated by the device
   supporting port ranges co-located with the NAS, e.g., a CGN or NAT64.

   The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute MAY appear in a CoA-Request packet.

   The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute MAY appear in an Accounting-Request
   packet.

   The IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The format of the IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute is shown in Figure 1.

         end user.  This TLV MUST be included in the IP-Port-Limit-Info
         Attribute.  Refer to Section 3.2.2.  This limit applies to all
         mappings that can be instantiated by an underlying address
         sharing device without soliciting any external entity.  In
         particular, this limit does not include the ports that are
         instructed by an AAA server.

      IP-Port-Ext-IPv4-Addr TLV

         This TLV contains the IPv4 address that is associated with the
         IP port limit contained in the IP-Port-Limit TLV.  This TLV is
         optionally included as part of the IP-Port-Limit-Info
         Attribute.  Refer to Section 3.2.3.

   IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute is associated with the following
   identifier: 241.5.

3.1.2.  IP-Port-Range Attribute

   This attribute is of type "TLV" as defined in the RADIUS Protocol
   Extensions [RFC6929].  It contains some sub-attributes and the
   requirement is as follows:

   o  The IP-Port-Range Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-Type TLV (see
      Section 3.2.1).

   o  The IP-Port-Range Attribute MUST contain the IP-Port-Alloc TLV
      (see Section 3.2.8).

   o  For port allocation, the IP-Port-Range Attribute MUST contain both
      the IP-Port-Range-Start TLV (see Section 3.2.9) and the IP-Port-
      Range-END TLV (see Section 3.2.10).  For port deallocation, the
      IP-Port-Range Attribute MAY contain both of these two TLVs; if the
      two TLVs are not included, it implies that all ports that were
      previously allocated are now all deallocated.

   o  The IP-Port-Range Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-Ext-IPv4-Addr
      TLV (see Section 3.2.3).

   o  The IP-Port-Range Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-Local-Id TLV
      (see Section 3.2.11).

   The IP-Port-Range Attribute contains a range of contiguous IP ports.
   These ports are either to be allocated or deallocated depending on
   the Value carried by the IP-Port-Alloc TLV.

   If the IP-Port-Type TLV is included as part of the IP-Port-Range
   Attribute, the port range is associated with the specific IP

   transport protocol as specified in the IP-Port-Type TLV, but
   otherwise is for all IP transport protocols.

   If the IP-Port-Ext-IPv4-Addr TLV is included as part of the IP-Port-
   Range Attribute, the port range as specified is associated with IPv4
   address as indicated, but otherwise is for all IPv4 addresses by the
   address sharing device (e.g., a CGN device) for the end user.

   This attribute can be used to convey a single IP transport port
   number; in such case the Value of the IP-Port-Range-Start TLV and the
   IP-Port-Range-End TLV, respectively, contain the same port number.

   The information contained in the IP-Port-Range Attribute is sent to
   RADIUS server.

   The IP-Port-Range Attribute MAY appear in an Accounting-Request
   packet.

   The IP-Port-Range Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The format of the IP-Port-Range Attribute is shown in Figure 2.

      This field contains a set of TLVs as follows:

      IP-Port-Type TLV

         This TLV contains a value that indicates the IP port type.
         Refer to Section 3.2.1.

      IP-Port-Alloc TLV

         This TLV contains a flag to indicate that the range of the
         specified IP ports for either allocation or deallocation.  This
         TLV MUST be included as part of the IP-Port-Range Attribute.
         Refer to Section 3.2.8.

      IP-Port-Range-Start TLV

3.1.3.  IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute

   This attribute is of type "TLV" as defined in the RADIUS Protocol
   Extensions [RFC6929].  It contains some sub-attributes and the
   requirement is as follows:

   o  The IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-Type
      TLV (see Section 3.2.1).

   o  The IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MUST contain both IP-Port-
      Int-Port TLV (see Section 3.2.6) and the IP-Port-Ext-Port TLV (see
      Section 3.2.7).

   o  If the internal realm is with IPv4 address family, the IP-Port-
      Forwarding-Map Attribute MUST contain the IP-Port-Int-IPv4-Addr
      TLV (see Section 3.2.4); if the internal realm is with IPv6
      address family, the IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MUST contain
      the IP-Port-Int-IPv6-Addr TLV (see Section 3.2.5).

   o  The IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-Ext-
      IPv4-Addr TLV (see Section 3.2.3).

   o  The IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MAY contain the IP-Port-
      Local-Id TLV (see Section 3.2.11).

   The attribute contains a 2-byte IP internal port number and a 2-byte
   IP external port number.  The internal port number is associated with
   an internal IPv4 or IPv6 address that MUST always be included.  The
   external port number is associated with a specific external IPv4
   address if included, but otherwise with all external IPv4 addresses
   for the end user.

   If the IP-Port-Type TLV is included as part of the IP-Port-
   Forwarding-Map Attribute, the port mapping is associated with the
   specific IP transport protocol as specified in the IP-Port-Type TLV,
   but otherwise is for all IP transport protocols.

   The IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in an Access-Request packet to indicate a
   preferred port mapping by the device co-located with NAS.  However
   the server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MAY appear in a CoA-Request
   packet.

   The IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute MAY also appear in an
   Accounting-Request packet.

3.2.  RADIUS TLVs for IP Ports

   The TLVs that are included in the three attributes (see Section 3.1)
   are defined in the following sub-sections.  These TLVs use the format
   defined in [RFC6929].  As the three attributes carry similar data, we
   have defined a common set of TLVs which are used for all three
   attributes.  That is, the TLVs have the same name and number, when
   encapsulated in any one of the three parent attributes.  See

   Section 3.1.1, Section 3.1.2, and Section 3.1.3 for a list of which
   TLV is permitted within which parent attribute.

   The encoding of the Value field of these TLVs follows the
   recommendation of [RFC6158].  In particular, IP-Port-Type, IP-Port-
   Limit, IP-Port-Int-Port, IP-Port-Ext-Port, IP-Port-Alloc, IP-Port-
   Range-Start, and IP-Port-Range-End TLVs are encoded in 32 bits as per

   The primary issue addressed by this TLV is that there are CGN
   deployments that do not distinguish internal hosts by their internal
   IP address alone, but use further identifiers for unique subscriber
   identification.  For example, this is the case if a CGN supports
   overlapping private or shared IP address spaces (refer to [RFC1918]
   and [RFC6598]) for internal hosts of different subscribers.  In such
   cases, different internal hosts are identified and mapped at the CGN
   by their IP address and/or another identifier, for example, the
   identifier of a tunnel between the CGN and the subscriber.  In these
   scenarios (and similar ones), the internal IP address is not
   sufficient to demultiplex connections from internal hosts.  An
   additional identifier needs to be present in the IP-Port-Range
   Attribute and IP-Port-Forwarding-Mapping Attribute in order to
   uniquely identify an internal host.  The IP-Port-Local-Id TLV is used
   to carry this identifier.

4.  Applications, Use Cases and Examples

   This section describes some applications and use cases to illustrate
   the use of the attributes proposed in this document.

4.1.  Managing CGN Port Behavior using RADIUS

   In a broadband network, customer information is usually stored on a
   RADIUS server, and the BNG acts as a NAS.  The communication between
   the NAS and the RADIUS server is triggered by a user when it signs in
   to the Internet service, where either PPP or DHCP/DHCPv6 is used.
   When a user signs in, the NAS sends a RADIUS Access-Request message
   to the RADIUS server.  The RADIUS server validates the request, and
   if the validation succeeds, it in turn sends back a RADIUS Access-
   Accept message.  The Access-Accept message carries configuration
   information specific to that user, back to the NAS, where some of the
   information would pass on to the requesting user via PPP or DHCP/
   DHCPv6.

   A CGN function in a broadband network is most likely be co-located on
   a BNG.  In that case, parameters for CGN port mapping behavior for
   users can be configured on the RADIUS server.  When a user signs in
   to the Internet service, the associated parameters can be conveyed to
   the NAS, and proper configuration is accomplished on the CGN device
   for that user.

   Also, CGN operation status such as CGN port allocation and
   deallocation for a specific user on the BNG can also be transmitted
   back to the RADIUS server for accounting purpose using the RADIUS
   protocol.

   RADIUS protocol has already been widely deployed in broadband
   networks to manage BNG, thus the functionality described in this
   specification introduces little overhead to the existing network
   operation.

   In the following sub-sections, we describe how to manage CGN behavior
   using RADIUS protocol, with required RADIUS extensions proposed in
   Section 3.

4.1.1.  Configure IP Port Limit for a User

   In the face of IPv4 address shortage, there are currently proposals
   to multiplex multiple users' connections over a number of shared IPv4
   addresses, such as Carrier Grade NAT [RFC6888], Dual-Stack Lite



Cheng, et al.             Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Extensions for IP Port        November 2016


   [RFC6333], NAT64 [RFC6146], etc.  As a result, a single IPv4 public
   address may be shared by hundreds or even thousands of users.  As
   indicated in [RFC6269], it is therefore necessary to impose limits on
   the total number of ports available to an individual user to ensure
   that the shared resource, i.e., the IPv4 address, remains available
   in some capacity to all the users using it.  The support of IP port
   limit is also documented in [RFC6888] as a requirement for CGN.

   The IP port limit imposed to an end user may be on the total number
   of IP source transport ports, or a specific IP transport protocol as
   defined in Section 3.1.1.

   The per-user based IP port limit is configured on a RADIUS server,
   along with other user information such as credentials.

   When a user signs in to the Internet service successfully, the IP
   port limit for the subscriber is passed by the RADIUS server to the
   BNG, acting as a NAS and co-located with the CGN, using the IP-Port-
   Limit-Info RADIUS attribute (defined in Section 3.1.1), along with
   other configuration parameters.  While some parameters are passed to
   the user, the IP port limit is recorded on the CGN device for
   imposing the usage of IP transport ports for that user.

   Figure 15 illustrates how RADIUS protocol is used to configure the
   maximum number of TCP/UDP ports for a given user on a CGN device.

   The IP port limit created on a CGN device for a specific user using
   RADIUS extension may be changed using RADIUS CoA message [RFC5176]
   that carries the same RADIUS attribute.  The CoA message may be sent
   from the RADIUS server directly to the NAS, which once accepts and
   sends back a RADIUS CoA ACK message, the new IP port limit replaces
   the previous one.

   Figure 16 illustrates how RADIUS protocol is used to increase the
   TCP/UDP port limit from 1024 to 2048 on a CGN device for a specific
   user.

4.1.2.  Report IP Port Allocation/Deallocation

   Upon obtaining the IP port limit for a user, the CGN device needs to
   allocate an IP transport port for the user when receiving a new IP
   flow sent from that user.

   As one practice, a CGN may allocate a block of IP ports for a
   specific user, instead of one port at a time, and within each port
   block, the ports may be randomly distributed or in consecutive
   fashion.  When a CGN device allocates a block of transport ports, the
   information can be easily conveyed to the RADIUS server by a new
   RADIUS attribute called the IP-Port-Range (defined in Section 3.1.2).
   The CGN device may allocate one or more IP port ranges, where each
   range contains a set of numbers representing IP transport ports, and
   the total number of ports MUST be less or equal to the associated IP
   port limit imposed for that user.  A CGN device may choose to
   allocate a small port range, and allocate more at a later time as
   needed; such practice is good because its randomization in nature.

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Extensions for IP Port        November 2016


   At the same time, the CGN device also needs to decide the shared IPv4
   address for that user.  The shared IPv4 address and the pre-allocated
   IP port range are both passed to the RADIUS server.

   When a user initiates an IP flow, the CGN device randomly selects a
   transport port number from the associated and pre-allocated IP port
   range for that user to replace the original source port number, along
   with the replacement of the source IP address by the shared IPv4
   address.

   A CGN device may decide to "free" a previously assigned set of IP
   ports that have been allocated for a specific user but not currently
   in use, and with that, the CGN device must send the information of
   the deallocated IP port range along with the shared IPv4 address to
   the RADIUS server.

   Figure 17 illustrates how RADIUS protocol is used to report a set of
   ports allocated and deallocated, respectively, by a NAT64 device for
   a specific user to the RADIUS server. 2001:db8:100:200::/56 is the
   IPv6 prefix allocated to this user.  In order to limit the usage of
   the NAT64 resources on a per-user basis for fairness of resource
   usage (see REQ-4 of [RFC6888]), port range allocations are bound to
   the /56 prefix, not to the source IPv6 address of the request.  The
   NAT64 devices is configured with the per-user port limit policy by
   some means (e.g., subscriber-mask [RFC7785]).

4.1.3.  Configure Forwarding Port Mapping

   In most scenarios, the port mapping on a NAT device is dynamically
   created when the IP packets of an IP connection initiated by a user
   arrives.  For some applications, the port mapping needs to be pre-
   defined allowing IP packets of applications from outside a CGN device
   to pass through and "port forwarded" to the correct user located
   behind the CGN device.

   Port Control Protocol [RFC6887], provides a mechanism to create a
   mapping from an external IP address and port to an internal IP
   address and port on a CGN device just to achieve the "port
   forwarding" purpose.  PCP is a server-client protocol capable of

   a few, typically just one pre-configured port mapping for
   applications such as web cam at home, and the lifetime of such a port
   mapping remains valid throughout the duration of the customer's
   Internet service connection time.  In such an environment, it is
   possible to statically configure a port mapping on the RADIUS server
   for a user and let the RADIUS protocol to propagate the information
   to the associated CGN device.

   Note that this document targets deployments where a AAA server is
   responsible de instructing NAT mappings for a given subscriber and
   does not make any assumption about the host's capabilities with
   regards to port forwarding control.  This deployment is complementary
   to PCP given that PCP targets a different deployment model where an
   application (on the host) controls its mappings in an upstream CPE,
   CGN, firewall, etc.

   Figure 18 illustrates how RADIUS protocol is used to configure a
   forwarding port mapping on a NAT44 device by using RADIUS protocol.

   A port forwarding mapping that is created on a CGN device using
   RADIUS extension as described above may also be changed using RADIUS
   CoA message [RFC5176] that carries the same RADIUS association.  The
   CoA message may be sent from the RADIUS server directly to the NAS,

   port forwarding mapping then replaces the previous one.

                                  mapping

4.1.4.  An Example

   An Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns TCP/UDP 500 ports for the
   user Joe. This number is the limit that can be used for TCP/UDP ports
   on a CGN device for Joe, and is configured on a RADIUS server.  Also,
   Joe asks for a pre-defined port forwarding mapping on the CGN device
   for his web cam applications (external port 5000 maps to internal
   port 1234).

   When Joe successfully connects to the Internet service, the RADIUS
   server conveys the TCP/UDP port limit (500) and the forwarding port
   mapping (external port 5000 to internal port 1234) to the CGN device,
   using IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute and IP-Port-Forwarding-Map
   attribute, respectively, carried by an Access-Accept message to the
   BNG where NAS and CGN co-located.

   Upon receiving the first outbound IP packet sent from Joe's laptop,
   the CGN device decides to allocate a small port pool that contains 40
   consecutive ports, from 3500 to 3540, inclusively, and also assign a
   shared IPv4 address 192.0.2.15, for Joe. The CGN device also randomly
   selects one port from the allocated range (say 3519) and use that
   port to replace the original source port in outbound IP packets.



Cheng, et al.             Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 30]

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Extensions for IP Port        November 2016


   For accounting purpose, the CGN device passes this port range
   (3500-3540) and the shared IPv4 address 192.0.2.15 together to the
   RADIUS server using IP-Port-Range attribute carried by an Accounting-
   Request message.

   When Joe works on more applications with more outbound IP mappings
   and the port pool (3500-3540) is close to exhaust, the CGN device
   allocates a second port pool (8500-8800) in a similar fashion, and
   also passes the new port range (8500-8800) and IPv4 address
   192.0.2.15 together to the RADIUS server using IP-Port-Range
   attribute carried by an Accounting-Request message.  Note when the
   CGN allocates more ports, it needs to assure that the total number of
   ports allocated for Joe is within the limit.

   Joe decides to upgrade his service agreement with more TCP/UDP ports
   allowed (up to 1000 ports).  The ISP updates the information in Joe's
   profile on the RADIUS server, which then sends a CoA-Request message
   that carries the IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute with 1000 ports to the
   CGN device; the CGN device in turn sends back a CoA-ACK message.
   With that, Joe enjoys more available TCP/UDP ports for his
   applications.

   When Joe is not using his service, most of the IP mappings are closed
   with their associated TCP/UDP ports released on the CGN device, which
   then sends the relevant information back to the RADIUS server using
   IP-Port-Range attribute carried by Accounting-Request message.

   Throughout Joe's connection with his ISP Internet service,
   applications can communicate with his web cam at home from external
   realm directly traversing the pre-configured mapping on the CGN
   device.

   When Joe disconnects from his Internet service, the CGN device will
   deallocate all TCP/UDP ports as well as the port-forwarding mapping,
   and send the relevant information to the RADIUS server.

4.2.  Report Assigned Port Set for a Visiting UE

   Figure 20 illustrates an example of the flow exchange which occurs
   when a visiting User Equipment (UE) connects to a CPE offering WLAN
   service.

   For identification purposes (see [RFC6967]), once the CPE assigns a
   port set, it issues a RADIUS message to report the assigned port set.

5.  Table of Attributes

   This document proposes three new RADIUS attributes and their formats
   are as follows:

   o  IP-Port-Limit-Info: 241.5.

   o  IP-Port-Range: 241.6.

   o  IP-Port-Forwarding-Map: 241.7.

   The following table provides a guide as what type of RADIUS packets
   that may contain these attributes, and in what quantity.

   0+      0+     0      0         0+       241.7 IP-Port-Forwarding-Map

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

   0  This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+ Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue other than the
   ones already identified in RADIUS [RFC2865] and [RFC5176] for CoA
   messages.  Known RADIUS vulnerabilities apply to this specification.
   For example, if RADIUS packets are sent in the clear, an attacker in
   the communication path between the RADIUS client and server may glean
   information that it will use to prevent a legitimate user to access
   the service by appropriately setting the maximum number of IP ports
   conveyed in an IP-Port-Limit-Info Attribute, exhaust the port quota
   of a user by installing many mapping entries (IP-Port-Forwarding-Map
   Attribute), prevent incoming traffic to be delivered to its
   legitimate destination by manipulating the mapping entries installed
   by means of an IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute, discover the IP
   address and port range assigned to a given user and which is reported
   in an IP-Port-Range Attribute, etc.  The root cause of these attack
   vectors is the communication between the RADIUS client and server.

   The IP-Port-Local-Id TLV includes an identifier of which the type and
   length is deployment and implementation dependent.  This identifier
   might carry privacy sensitive information.  It is therefore
   RECOMMENDED to utilize identifiers that do not have such privacy
   concerns.

   If there is any error in a Radius Accounting-Request packet sent from
   a RADIUS client to the server, the RADIUS server MUST NOT send
   response to the client (refer to [RFC2866]).  Examples of the errors
   include the erroneous port range in IP-Port-Range Attribute,
   inconsistent port mapping in IP-Port-Forwarding-Map Attribute, etc.

   This document targets deployments where a trusted relationship is in
   place between the RADIUS client and server with communication
   optionally secured by IPsec or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC6614].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires new code point assignments for both IPFIX
   Information Elements and RADIUS attributes as explained in the
   following sub-sections.

7.1.  IANA Considerations on New IPFIX Information Elements

   The following is a new IPFIX Information Element as requested by this
   document (refer to Section 3.2.2) :

   o  sourceTransportPortsLimit:

      *  Name: sourceTransportPortsLimit.

      *  Element ID: 458.

      *  Description: This Information Element contains the maximum
         number of IP source transport ports that can be used by an end
         user when sending IP packets; each user is associated with one
         or more (source) IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  This IE is
         particularly useful in address sharing deployments that adhere
         to REQ-4 of [RFC6888].  Limiting the number of ports assigned
         to each user ensures fairness among users and mitigates the
         denial-of-service attack that a user could launch against other
         users through the address sharing device in order to grab more
         ports.

      *  Data type: unsigned16.

      *  Data type semantics: totalCounter.

      *  Data type unit: ports.

      *  Data value range: from 1 to 65535.

7.2.  IANA Considerations on New RADIUS Attributes

   The authors request that Attribute Types and Attribute Values defined
   in this document be registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) from the RADIUS namespaces as described in the "IANA
   Considerations" section of [RFC3575], in accordance with BCP 26
   [RFC5226].  For RADIUS packets, attributes and registries created by
   this document IANA is requested to place them at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types.

   In particular, this document defines three new RADIUS attributes,
   entitled "IP-Port-Limit-Info" (see Section 3.1.1), "IP-Port-Range"

   (see Section 3.1.2) and "IP-Port-Forwarding-Map" (see Section 3.1.3),
   with assigned values of 241.5, 241.6 and 241.7 from the Short
   Extended Space of [RFC6929]:

      Type       Name                   Meaning
      ----       ----                   -------
      241.5     IP-Port-Limit-Info     see Section 3.1.1
      241.6     IP-Port-Range          see Section 3.1.2
      241.7     IP-Port-Forwarding-Map see Section 3.1.3

7.3.  IANA Considerations on New RADIUS TLVs

   IANA has created a new registry called "RADIUS IP Port Configuraion
   and Reporting TLVs".  All TLVs in this registry have one or more
   parent Radius attributes in nesting (refer to [RFC6929].  This
   registray contains the following TLVs:

      Value  Name                     Definition
      -----  -----                    ----------
      0      Reserved
      1      IP-Port-Type             see Section 3.2.1
      2      IP-Port-Limit            see Section 3.2.2
      3      IP-Port-Ext-IPv4-Addr    see Section 3.2.3
      4      IP-Port-Int-IPv4-Addr    see Section 3.2.4
      5      IP-Port-Int-IPv6-Addr    see Section 3.2.5
      6      IP-Port-Int-Port         see Section 3.2.6
      7      IP-Port-Ext-Port         see Section 3.2.7
      8      IP-Port-Alloc            see Section 3.2.8
      9      IP-Port-Range-Start      see Section 3.2.9
      10     IP-Port-Range-End        see Section 3.2.10
      11     IP-Port-Local-Id         see Section 3.2.11
      12-255 Unsigned

   The registration procedure for this registry is Standards Action as
   defined in [RFC5226].
