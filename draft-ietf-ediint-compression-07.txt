Keywords

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      [RFC2119].
 
Abstract
 
   The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as an
   Informational RFC.
 
   The EDIINT AS1 and AS2 message formats don't currently contain any
   transport neutral provisions for compressing data when utilizing
   S/MIME as the secure packaging standard. Compressing data before
   transmission provides a number of advantages including
 
   1. reducing data redundancy, and so reducing opportunities for
      attacks exploiting redundancy, and
   2. reducing the amount of data and so speeding up cryptographic
      processing such as signing, encryption, archiving, and
   3. reducing the overall transmitted message size, reducing both time
      and bandwidth needed for transport.
 
1. Introduction
 
   This document describes an additional mime layer of compressed data
   utilizing a new ContentInfo type for S/MIME. This new compressed-data
   content type is defined in S/MIME 3.1, RFC RFC 3851. Further
   reference can be found in the reference section under
   [COMPRESSED-DATA]. The method of compression outlined in this
   document will support any type of business related media. Documents
   containing a large percentage of ASCII characters like xml, x12 or
   edifact will experience greater compression ratios than documents
   consisting largely of binary data. Ex: MSWord documents.
 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
 
1.1 Compressed-Data Mime Wrapper
 
   The compressed-data cms object will encapsulate a mime wrapped
   business document. Implementors are to follow the appropriate
   specifications identified under "References" in [MIME-TYPES], for
   the type of object being transmitted. For example, to send an XML
   object, the MIME media type of application/xml is used in the
   Content-type MIME header field and the specifications for 
   enveloping the object are contained in [XMLTYPES];

INTERNET DRAFT         Compressed Data for EDIINT          December 2007

   for example:
 
        Content-type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
 
   The mime wrapped object will be compressed and placed inside a CMS
   compressed-data object as outlined in [COMPRESSED-DATA]. The
   compressed data object will be mime wrapped according to details
   outlined in [S/MIME3.1], RFC 3851, Section 3.5. 
 
Example: 
 
   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=compressed-data; 
           name=smime.p7z
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=smime.p7z

   Note: Content-Transfer-Encoding would only be required if the mime
   wrapped CMS object was transferred via a 7-bit protocol like SMTP
   and it was visible in the outer layer of the mime message. If the
   compressed-data mime bodypart was place inside of an encrypted mime 
   bodypart, content-transfer-encoding would not be required on the 
   compressed-data mime bodypart, but would be required on the
   encrypted mime bodypart.
 
1.2 Structure of an EDI MIME message utilizing compression
 
   When compressing a document which will be signed, the application
   MAY compress the inner most MIME body before signing, see Section 
   1.2.2.1and 1.2.4.1 or MAY compress the outer multipart/signed mime 
   body, see Section 1.2.2.2 and 1.2.4.2. but MUST not do both within
   the same document. The receiving application MUST support both
   methods of compression when unpackaging an inbound document.

2. MIC Calculations For Compresed Messages Requesting Signed Receipts
 
   For any signed messages, the MIC to be returned is calculated over
   the same data that was signed in the original message as per AS1.
 
   For encrypted, unsigned messages, the MIC to be returned is
   calculated over the uncompressed data content including all 
   mime header fields and any applied Content-Transfer-Encoding.

Harding                                                        [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT         Compressed Data for EDIINT          December 2007

 
   For unsigned, unencrypted messages, the MIC is calculated
   over the uncompressed data content including all mime header
   fields and any applied Content-Transfer-Encoding.
 
3. Error Disposition Modifier
 
   For a received message where a signed receipt has been requested
   and decompression fails, the following disposition modifier will be
   returned in the signed mdn.
 
    "Error: decompression-failed" - the receiver could not decompress
    
4. AS2 Version Header Field
 
   Any application that supports the compression methods outlined within
   this document MUST use a version identifier value of "1.1" or greater
   within the AS2 or AS3 Version header field as describe in HTTP 
   Transport for Secure Peer-to-Peer EDI over the Internet, see 
   reference[AS2] and FTP Transport for Secure Peer-to-Peer EDI over the
   Internet, see reference[AS3].
 
5. Compression Formats
 
   Implementations SHOULD support ZLIB [ZLIB] which utilizes
   DEFLATE[DEFLATE], and is free of any intellectual property
   restrictions and has a freely-available, portable and efficient
   reference implementation.
 
6. Security Considerations
 
   This document is not concerned with security, except for the fact
   that compressing data before encryption can enhance the security by
   reducing redundancy of the file. The lower the redundancy of the
   plaintext being encrypted, the more difficult the cryptanalysis, see
   reference[CRYPTANALYSIS].
 
7. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
