Abstract

   This document proposes a mechanism to obtain a Kerberos Ticket
   Granting Ticket based on a successful EAP authentication and key
   agreement message exchange.  The initial network access
   authentication procedure based on EAP is ideal for this purpose.
   This proposal allows Kerberos to be used within a local network
   without relying on a global Kerberos infrastructure.  It should allow
   an incremental deployment of Kerberos and a wider distribution of
   Kerberos into roaming environments.

1.  Introduction

   Kerberos (see [RFC1510] and
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications]) is a well-known security
   protocol which provides authentication, authorization and key
   distribution and is used to secure a number of protocols - a list too
   large to mention here.  It is widely deployed in enterprise networks
   where cross-realm authentication is not required at all or only to a
   certain extend (in a environment with a hierarchical organizational
   structure).  In mobility environments Kerberos is, unfortunately, not
   widely deployed since AAA protocols (such as RADIUS and DIAMETER),
   which have different cross-realm (or inter-domain) signaling message
   exchanges, are heavily used.  The security properties of AAA
   protocols and Kerberos also differ.  The EAP key management framework
   is described in [I-D.ietf-eap-keying].  This proposal tries to
   combine the two protocols: Kerberos is used within the local network
   and the AAA protocol is used as part of the network access
   authentication and for communication between the visited network and
   the home network.

3.  Problem Statement

   RADIUS [RFC2865] and DIAMETER [RFC3588] are used in an environment
   where accounting and charging is an important functionality.
   Kerberos was never designed to provide these features.  Kerberos
   provides cross-realm functionality in a way which is different to
   EAP/AAA protocols.  Even though the cross-realm authentication
   approach used by Kerberos might provide better security properties
   (such as denial of service protection) the EAP/AAA is gaining
   importance.

   By combining the functionality of AAA protocols (cross-realm/
   inter-domain behavior, accounting functionality and the existing AAA
   infrastructure) with the benefits of Kerberos (support by a number of
   existing protocols, authorization capabilities, key distribution and
   protection of messages) a number of advantages can be achieved.

   Section 3.4.4 of [I-D.iab-research-funding] points to the importance
   of providing solutions for inter-realm Kerberos deployments: 'The
   need for scalable inter-domain user authentication is increasingly
   acute as ad-hoc computing and mobile computing become more widely
   deployed.  Thus, work on scalable mechanisms for mobile, ad-hoc, and
   non-hierarchical inter-domain authentication would be very helpful.'

4.  Solution Approach

   At its abstract level this proposal suggests to start with a regular
   AAA communication which might inludes the usage of EAP
   [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis].  EAP acts as a container for a number of
   authentication and key agreement mechanisms.  The AAA infrastructure
   is used to route, to transport and to secure AAA messages and their
   payloads.  As a result of the network access authentication the user
   is authenticated to its home AAA server (in the subscription based
   scenario) and the AAA protocol is ready to exchange collected
   accounting records.  In addition to this exchange the visited network
   (to which the user's device is attached) receives the gurantee
   through the execution of the AAA protocol and the AAA infrastructure
   (roaming agreements etc.) that the home network can be hold liable
   for the payment for the consumed resources by the end user.

   Subsequently to a successful authentication and authorization the AAA
   protocol does not only transmit a session key to the AAA attendant
   but also creates a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).  This TGT
   is only valid for the local network and is sent to the end host.  The
   session key is only sent to the Authenticator and not to the end host
   whereas the TGT has to be made available to the end host itself.  A
   protocol between the end host and the Authenticator is therefore
   required to carry the TGT.

   Using the obtained TGT the user is able to request further service
   tickets using a standard Kerberos service ticket request.  A user
   might also request service tickets for various applications, to
   secure infrastructure services (DHCP, SLP, DNS, etc.), to secure QoS
   signaling protocols (see [RFC3182] for RSVP security based on
   Kerberos) or might even request a service ticket to subsequently
   execute KINK [I-D.ietf-kink-kink] for the purpose of establishing
   IPsec security associations.

   Figure 1 shows a typical message exchange executed when an end host
   moves to a new network.  First, in step (1) some sort of address
   configuration procedure takes place.  If the network access
   authentication procedure is executed as part of the link layer
   protocol as for example in IEEE 802.11 then address configuration is
   executed after step (2).  The network access procedure (2) might
   require many roundtrips depending on the authentication and key
   exchange protocol used.  Finally, after a sucessful completion of the
   protocol exchange a TGT is attached to the final message and send to
   the end host in step (3).  This requires an additional Radius/
   Diameter attribute to carry the TGT from the local AAA server (if we
   assume that it is created at the local AAA server), which is assumed
   to be co-located with the Kerberos Authentication Server (labeled as
   KDC in Figure 1).  Co-locating these two entities is done mainly for

   simplicity reasons since an additional protocol would be required for
   commuication rather than an API call.  The TGT must, additionally, be
   sent from the AAA attendant to the end host.  Subsequently Kerberos
   service tickets can be requested using the standard Kerberos message
   exchange (step (4)).

   FOR DISCUSSION: Should we create

   o  a Ticket Granting Ticket which is sent to the end host or

   o  bootstrap a security association (and in particular a session key)
      which is then used by the end host to request the Ticket Granting
      Ticket.

   The latter approach would not modify the inital TGT Kerberos
   exchange.  Further issues are discussed in Section 8.

   EAP acts as a container for a number of authentication and key
   exchange protocols.  As such some observations have to be made
   concerning the properties of the used mechanisms: Since the Ticket
   Granting Ticket has to include the AAA distributed session key (key
   field in the encrypted part of the ticket) this proposal requires an
   EAP mechanism which provides session key distribution.  This session
   key is then used by the end host to create an Authenticator for a
   subsequent service ticket requests.

                         Figure 1: Message Flow

   Figure 2 shows a Ticket Granting Ticket with the relevant fields.
   The ticket consists of two parts - one unencrypted and an encrypted
   part.  The unencrypted part contains only information for the
   recepient (in our case for the Ticket Granting Server) to be able to
   recognize a ticket for which a key to decrypt the ticket is
   available.  In the described case these fields contain the ticket
   version number, the realm name of the visited network and the
   principal name of the Ticket Granting Server (TGS).  The remaining
   fields of the ticket are encrypted with the key known only to the TGS
   and the Authentication Server (AS).  Note that the AS is co-located
   with the local AAA server in our scenario.  The encrypted part of the
   ticket contains information about the user's realm and its identity
   which are obtained from the initial authentication procedure.  The
   flags field contains a flag which provides an indication of this
   Kerberos bootstrapping procedure to differentiate it to a regular
   AS_REQ/AS_REP exchange.  The key field is important since it contains
   the session key distributed during the initial authentication

   procedure as described in Figure 1 in step (2).  This session key is
   subsequently only relevant for the TGS.  For service authentication
   between the end host and application servers and new service ticket
   has to be requested from the TGS using a standard Kerberos TGS_REQ/
   TGS_REP message exchange.

   Note that a protocol is required to carry the EAP messages and the
   TGT from the AAA attendant to the end host.  Such a protocol is
   required to exchange the necessary parameters.  This document does
   not mandate a particular protocol.  However, PANA
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] is suitable for this purpose since it is a
   flexbile and extensible protocol and allows the secure exchange of
   parameters between the end host and the network.

                Figure 2: Ticket Granting Ticket Content

   It is important to highlight that the proposal described in this
   document makes an assumption which has to be satisified in order for
   this bootstrapping mechanism to work:

   The authentication and key exchange protocol shown in Figure 1 (step
   2) assumes that a session key is distributed and after a successful
   protocol execution established between the end host and the AAA
   attendant.  The session key distribution with the help of AAA also
   allows the local AAA server to learn the session key.  Since the
   Ticket Granting Ticket requires a session key to be placed in the Key
   field as shown in Figure 2.  Hence authentication and key exchange
   protocol which do not establish a session key between the end host
   and the local network (AAA attendant/local AAA server) cannot be used

   for bootstrapping a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket.

   Additionally it should be noted that the proposed bootstrapping
   protocol does not necessarily require the execution of a EAP
   protocol.  Protocols such as described in [I-D.perkins-aaav6], in
   [I-D.mun-aaa-dbu-mobileipv6] and in [I-D.le-aaa-diameter-mobileipv6]
   would also provide the desired functionality without relying on EAP
   methods for authentication.  Instead a custom authenthication and key
   exchange protocol is defined.  Even the protocols developed in the
   SACRED working group would provide the necessary pre-requisity to
   return a Ticket Granting Ticket and to use this proposal.  To focus
   on an increasingly common deployment environment we have focused on
   EAP.

5.  What are the advantages?

   The authors think that this proposal has the following advantages:

   o  A large number of protocols support Kerberos as an authentication
      and key distribution protocol.  Enabling Kerberos to be used for
      these environments would also enable these protocols to be secured
      with Kerberos.

   o  Initial cross-realm/inter-domain authentication can be done using
      an arbitrary protocol (in case of EAP).

   o  Kerberos relies on symmetric keys (ignoring PKINIT
      [I-D.ietf-cat-kerberos-pk-init] and PKCROSS
      [I-D.ietf-cat-kerberos-pk-cross]) for authentication and key
      distribution.  The usage of symmetric keys is highly efficient and
      the risk of denial of service attacks often found in public key
      based protocols is reduced.

   o  Kerberos tickets are designed to allow authorization information
      to be added to the ticket itself.  Authorization information can
      be added by the KDC and allows services to base their access
      control policies not only on the identity of the principal.

   o  When passwords are used with Kerberos (without PKINIT or other
      mechanisms) then there might be a vulnerability to dictionary
      attacks.  Replacing the AS exchange with an EAP authentication
      this vulnerability can be prevented.  Note that this assumes that
      the chosen EAP method is not vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

   o  Some EAP methods provide user identity confidentiality of the EAP
      peer against either active or passive adversaries.  If a Kerberos
      Ticket Granting Ticket is created with the help of the EAP derived
      key and the user identity is not copied to the Ticket Granting
      Ticket then there is no indication for an eavesdropper about the
      identity of a user.  This approach therefore adds user identity
      confidentiality to Kerberos.

6.  What are the disadvanges?

   Despite the advantages listed in the previous section there are some
   disadvantages or constraints with the following proposal:

   o  A Kerberos implementation has to be supported by end hosts.

   o  Kerberos heavily relies on timestamps.  If the clocks of the end
      host and the various servers in the access network suffer from a
      clock-drift then some procedure is required for clock-
      synchronization.  Such procedures are for example described
      in[I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications].  It requires further
      investigation whether a secure time distribution mechanism should
      be included in this proposal.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security of the proposed mechanism relies on the selected EAP
   mechanism, on Kerberos and on the AAA key distribution mechanism.  A
   security analysis of different EAP methods is outside the scope of
   this document.  It is assumed that the AAA key distribution
   mechanism, the selected EAP method and Kerberos is secure.

   Hence this section can only describe threats related to the proposed
   distribution of the TGT.

   Stealing of the TGT:

      An adversary might eavesdrop on the wireless link between the end
      host and the AAA attendant to learn the exchanged TGT.  Without
      confidentiality protection of the TGT an adversary might be able
      to retrieve the TGT.  Since the TGT is encrypted with the key of
      the ticket granting server (TGS).  It is assumed that this key has
      sufficient length.This assures that an adversary is able to learn
      the encrypted content of the ticket.  Hence we can conclude that
      an adversary might not be able to request further service tickets
      only based on the knowledge of the ticket granting ticket.  This
      is inline with the basic principles of Kerberos.


   Modification of the TGT:

      An adversary might want to modify the content of the TGT.  A TGS
      would immediately detect such a modification because most parts of
      the ticket are encrypted.  The unencrypted parts only contain
      information about the TGS and its realm and are useless for an
      adversary.


   Replay of the TGT:

      An adverary (malicious end host) might want to reuse a TGT of a
      previous message exchange.  Since the TGT contains a lifetime
      field it is not possible to use TGTs with an expired lifetime.  In
      order to request a service ticket the end host has to know the
      session key to build an Authenticator.

Internet-Draft           Bootstrapping Kerberos                July 2004


8.  Open Issues

   This section lists some open issues which have been identified during
   the work on this approach:

   o  Packet formats (e.g., AAA AVP, PANA AVPs, etc.) are missing.

   o  As an alternative to provide the end host (i.e., user) with a TGT
      it would be possible to create a tentaive user account at the KDC.
      This allows the end host to request a TGT and subsequently service
      tickets.  This approach would not require a TGT to be transferred
      to the end host with the initial AAA exchange.

   o  In order to provide a service ticket to run KINK for achieving
      secure network access an additional roundtrip is required.
      Solutions are possible which allow the establishment of an IPsec
      security association with a fewer number of roundtrips.

   o  Should it be possible to request more than a TGT (for example a
      service ticket for secure network access) with the help of this
      proposal?

   o  It might be helpful to have a flag inside the ticket to indicate
      that the ticket presented to a server was not obtained by a
      regular AS exchange but rather with this bootstapping mechanism.

   o  It would also be possible to provide the client with a secure
      network time by protecting the timestamp as part of a PANA
      exchange.

   o  Should the proposed extension return a full AS_REP instead of only
      the TGT? This would allow the end host to learn the current time
      based on the information inside the ticket.  The TGT also contains
      time information but it is not accessible for the end host (i.e.
      it is included in the encrypted part).

   o  In this proposal the TGT is created at the local AAA server.
      Therefore the local AAA server needs to wait until a succuessful
      network access authentication indication is available.  The
      EAP-Success message indicates a succesful EAP method protocol run.
      Hence, it is necessary for the AAA server to bind the EAP run to
      the TGT.  Furthermore, the local AAA server needs to inspect the
      session key transferred with the AAA attribute in order to create
      the TGT.  More details need to be provided.  It might be possible
      to create the TGT at the Authenticator itself rather than in the
      local AAA server.  This would, however, cause an increase in the
      number of entities which need to be trusted by the KDC.

   o  Finally, it might be possible to replace this entire bootstrapping
      mechanism with a new AS_REQ/AS_REP protocol exchange which uses
      EAP.  This exchange could use EAP and the KDC would act as the
      Authenticator in the EAP architecture.  The main advantage of this
      approach is achieved by protocol separation.  A full EAP roundtrip
      might not be required since the local AAA server might have stored
      the session key of the previous protocol run already.

   o  Some discussions with regard to the EAP keying framework should go
      in Section 7.  A future version of this document will contain a
      formal verification of the proposed approach.

   o  The relationship with the work done in the 3GPP Bootstrapping
      architecture and the SACRED work needs to be described.
