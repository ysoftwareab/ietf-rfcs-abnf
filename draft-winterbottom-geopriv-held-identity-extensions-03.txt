Internet-Draft                 HELD-ID-EXT                  October 2007


1.  Introduction

   Protocols such as HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] need
   to identify a device in order to perform some task.  Basic HELD only
   provides device identity through the IP address of the requesting
   Target, while [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] provides examples of where
   this may be insufficent.  This memo defines a set of URIs an a
   containment schema that allow the specification of device identity
   beyond source IP address and may be used with HELD and general
   presence documents as described in [RFC4479].

2.  Terminology

   The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined
   as follows:

   This document reuses the terms Device and Target, as defined in
   [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Information Server, LIS as
   described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Details

   The details of this memo consist of a simple schema extension for
   HELD to support the inclusion of a device identity in the form of a
   URI or typed-token, and a set of URI definitions that can be used for
   device identities.

3.1.  URI Definitions

   The URIs defined in this section are designed to identify a device.
   The URIs identify the Device, they do not identify measurements or
   sighting data associated with a Device, such as the switch and port
   information to which the Device is attached (which can be acquired
   using DHCP relay information [RFC3046] or LLDP [LLDP].  Device
   measurements and sighting data are described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].  The identity provided may
   be transitory, such as an IP address that is leased from a DHCP
   server pool, but it MUST uniquely identify a device within a network
   at the time it is used.

   The URIs in this section are defined using ABNF (augmented Backus-
   Naur form) described in [RFC2234].

3.1.1.  Ethernet MAC URI

   This is the Ethernet hardware address of the device.  The form of
   this URI is used as example in [RFC4479] and this section provides
   the ABNF for this URI type.  An example of its use is provided in
   Figure 5.

   mac-uri = "mac:" 12*12HEXDIG

3.1.2.  IP Address URIs

   This section provides the ABNF for IP version 4 and IP version 6
   URIs.  One application of this URI scheme is described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps], where an outbound SIP proxy needs to
   make location requests to a LIS on-behalf-of a Device because, for
   some reason, the necessary information was not provided by the
   Device.

   ip-uri = "ip:" ipv4 / ipv6
   ipv4 = "IPv4+" IPv4-Address
   IPv4-Address = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   ipv6 = "IPv6+" hexpart [ ":" IPv4-Address ]
   hexpart =  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq  =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
   hex4    =  1*4HEXDIG

   An example of a location request including a URI in this form to
   identify the Target device is shown in Figure 3.

   <locationRequest
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held" responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <heldDevice  xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
       <uri>ip:IPv4+192.0.2.5</uri>
     </heldDevice>
   </locationRequest>

            Figure 3: HELD Location Request Using an IP Address

   Note that the URI types are not case sensative and the iP:ipv4+
   192.0.2.5 is still a valid URI.

3.2.  Device Identity Schema

   This section defines a schema that can be used to provide device
   identities in a HELD location request.

   The schema provided in Figure 4 allows a URI and/or token to be
   provided so a Device can identify itself by more than just its IP
   address.  The URI can also include an optional "type" attribute so
   that URIs that might otherwise look the same can be distinguished
   based on their usage.

   For example <uri type="gruu">sip:callee@example.com</uri> or <uri
   type="aor">sip:callee@example.com</uri>

   When the <identifier> element is used the "type" attribute is
   mandatory as this tells the LIS or receiving entity how to interpret
   the identifier.  An IANA registry is established for the central
   repository for recognized identifier types.  The set of initial types
   is provided in Section 5.3.

   A HELD location request sent by a device using the schema shown in
   Figure 4 to provide its identity as a mac URI would look similar to
   Figure 5.

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                    responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <heldDevice xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
          <uri>mac:01ab34ef690c</uri>
     </heldDevice>
   </locationRequest>

                Figure 5: HELD Location Request URI example

   Similarly a device identifying itself using its DHCP client
   identifier (DHCP option 61 in [RFC2132]) in a location request to a
   LIS would send something similar to Figure 6.

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                    responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <heldDevice xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
          <identifier type="dhcpClientId">035552764</identifier>
     </heldDevice>
   </locationRequest>

4.  Security Considerations

   An Operator of a LIS that supports this schema extension needs to
   ensure that location provided to nodes requesting location in this
   manner are entitled to the location information being requested.  In
   some circumstances support of this schema extension will be
   inappropriate and alternative measures will need to be employed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers an XML namespace and schema with IANA in
   accordance with guidelines in [RFC3688].  It also creates a new
   registry for device identity types, and stipulates how new types are
   to be added.

5.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id

   This section registers a new XML namespace,
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id", as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id

      Registrant Contact: IETF, GEOPRIV working group,
      (geopriv@ietf.org), James Winterbottom
      (james.winterbottom@andrew.com).

   Registrant Contact:  IETF, GEOPRIV working group, (geopriv@ietf.org),
      James Winterbottom (james.winterbottom@andrew.com).

   Schema:  The XML for this schema can be found as the entirety of
      Figure 4 of this document.

5.3.  Identifier 'type' Attribute values

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry for
   identifier 'type' attribute values.  These are text strings that
   clarify how the value identifies the Device.  Referring to [RFC2434]
   this registry operates under the "Expert Review" rule.

   The following identifier types are registered as part of this memo:

   o  'dhcpClientId' The DHCP client identifier as defined by DHCP
      option 61 in [RFC2132]

   o  'msisdn' The Mobile Station International Subscriber Dial Number.
      This is an E.164 number made up of 6 to 15 digits

   o  'imsi' The International Mobile Subscriber identifier.  A unique
      identifier for GSM or UMTS mobile terminal made up of 6 to 15
      digits that identify the country code, the network code and
      device.

   o  'imei' The International Mobile Equipment identifier.  This is an
      electronic serial number for a mobile device and is consists of up
      to 15 digits

   o  'min' Mobile Identification Number.  A unique equipment identifier
      assigned to CDMA handsets.

   o  'mdn' Mobile Dial Number.  An E.164 number made up of 6 to 15
      digits.

   o  'hostname' The hostname or FQDN of the device.

Appendix A.  Alternatives

   An alternative to providing the mobile identifiers as an <identifier>
   'type' they could be defined as URI types as shown below.  This would
   fit seeming well as other telephony device identifiers are already
   specified using telephone URIs [RFC3966].

   mobile-uri    = "mob:" mobile-identifier
   mobile-identifier = imsi / msisdn / imei / min / mdn
   imsi = "imsi:" 6*15DIGIT
   msisdn = "msisdn:" 6*15DIGIT
   imei = "imei:" 1*15DIGIT
   min = "min:" 1*15DIGIT
   mdn = "mdn:" 6*15DIGIT

   The URIs defined above allow an easy way for the Device to specify
   this binding to a LIS by using a HELD location request.  When the LIS
   receives the location request in Figure 9 it is able to bind the
   source IP address of the location request with the provided MSISDN.

   <locationRequest
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held" responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <heldDevice xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
         <uri>mob:msisdn:61448266004</uri>
     </heldDevice>
   </locationRequest>
