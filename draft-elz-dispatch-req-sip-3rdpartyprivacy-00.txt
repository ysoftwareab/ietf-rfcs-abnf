INTERNET DRAFT Requirements for 3rd Party Privacy in SIP   March 7, 2011


1  Introduction

   The introduction of the Privacy mechanism {RFC3323only allows the
   setting of privacy for 'user' and 'header' identities from a UAC
   perspective in the Request and the UAS in the Response. The privacy
   mechanism was extended by {RFC3325] to include the 'id' privacy. At
   the time this was all that was required as  SIP did not provide
   headers for carrying a third party identity in a Request or Response.
   The introduction of the REFER Method [RFC3515] and then the Referred-
   by mechanism [RFC3892] allowed for passing of a third party identity.

   The introduction of History-info [RFC4244] introduced an additional
   mechanism for passing of third part identities and modified the
   privacy specifically for History-info by use of the 'history' tag.

   There is still no mechanism in SIP for indicating the privacy of
   third party identities in a Request or Response other than the
   specific extension for History-info.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Problem Scenarios

   Two individual issues arise from the addition of new headers and
   their impact on privacy:

   - How to specify the Privacy of 3rd Party Identities which occurs due
   to passing of these identities; e.g. Referred-by

   - The precedence of privacy values when there is a Privacy header and
   and privacy parameter as specified for History-info

2.1 Privacy of 3rd Party Identities 

   The following scenario describes the case where a third party
   identity is passed in a SIP Request but the existing Privacy
   mechanism does not allow for the setting of privacy for the third
   party identity.

   Alice                       Bob                      Charlie
     |    1. REFER Alice        |                          | 
     |<-------------------------|                          | 
     | Refer-to: Charlie        |                          | 
     | Referred-by: Bob         |                          | 
     | Privacy: user,header,id  |                          | 
     |                          |                          | 
     |  2. INVITE Charlie Privacy: none  Referred-by: Bob  | 
     |---------------------------------------------------->| 
     |                                                     | 
   Figure 1 - Referred-by privacy?

   1. Bob sends a REFER to Alice to advise how she may contact Charlie.
   Bob includes a Privacy header as he does not want his identities made
   available. In the REFER request this should also be applicable to the
   Referred-by header as it also contains Bob's identity.

   2. Alice sends and INVITE to Charlie following receipt of the REFER.
   The INVITE request has an explicit Privacy header of "none". This
   indicates that Alice does not require privacy for any of the
   identities included in the INVITE. This will also be applicable to
   the Referred-by header.

   As Bob has explicitly requested privacy when he sent the REFER
   request it is implicit that his identity should be kept private. The
   INVITE request has no mechanism for indicating that the Referred-by
   should be private as it is a third party identity whilst other
   identities may be revealed. 

2.2 Precedence of Privacy Headers

   The following scenario illustrates a conflict in privacy settings
   where the existing standards do not define which value has
   precedence.

   Alice                       Bob                      Charlie
     |    1. INVITE Bob         |                          | 
     |------------------------->|                          | 
     |     Privacy: none        |                          | 
     |                          |                          | 
     |                          |  2. INVITE Charlie       | 
     |                          |------------------------->| 
     |                          |    Privacy: none         | 
     |                          |    H-I: <sip:Bob;Privacy=history>;index=1
     |                          |    H-I: <sip:Charlie>;index=1

   1. Alice sends an INVITE to Bob and sets Privacy as "none".

   2. Bob forwards the INVITE to Charlie and includes History-info
   headers. As Bob does not want his identity revealed to Charlie he
   includes a Privacy header parameter.

   The second INVITE has an issue as the Privacy header of "none"
   conflicts with the "history" privacy value included in the History-
   info header. What privacy should be applied by Charlie to the
   received message. Should the "none" apply which would allow Bob's
   identity in the History-info to be revealed? Should the privacy
   associated with the URI in the History-info take precedence over the
   "none"?

   At present the existing standards do not specify any precedence in
   this case.

2.3  Requirements

   Additional standardization work is required to fulfil the following
   requirements.

   1. Capability is required to allow passing of privacy values related
   to third party identity in SIP messages.

   2. When privacy is set for a third party identity in a SIP message
   the precedence of conflicting privacy values must be understood.

3  Security Considerations

   Not applicable

4  IANA Considerations
