1.  Introduction

   When using QR or Aztec codes a different encoding scheme is needed
   than the already established base 64, base 32 and base 16 encoding
   schemes that are described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648].  The difference
   from those and base 45 is the key table and that the padding with '='
   is not required.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Interpretation of Encoded Data

   Encoded data is to be interpreted as described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648]
   with the exception that a different alphabet is selected.

4.  The Base 45 Encoding

   A 45-character subset of US-ASCII is used, the 45 characters that can
   be used in a QR or Aztec code.  If we look at Base 64, it encodes 3
   bytes in 4 characters.  Base 45 encodes 2 bytes in 3 characters.

   The two bytes [A, B] are turned into [ C, D, E] where (A*256) + B = C
   + (D*45) + (E*45*45).  The values C, D and E are then looked up in
   Table 1 to produce a three character string and the reverse when
   decoding.

   If the number of octets are not dividable by two, the last remaining
   byte is represented by two characters.  [A] is turned into [ C, D]
   where A = C + (D*45).

4.1.  Encoding example

   A series of bytes is turned into groups of two.  Each such 16 bit
   value is turned into a series of three values calculated by doing
   successive calculations modulo 45.  The values are in turned looked
   up in what is displayed in Table 1.

   Encoding example 1: The string "AB" is the byte sequence [65 66].
   The 16 bit value is 65 * 256 + 66 = 16706. 16706 equals 11 + 45 * 11
   + 45 * 45 * 8 so the sequence in base 45 is [11 11 8].  By looking up
   these values in the table we get the encoded string "BB8".

   Encoding example 2: The string "Hello!!" is the byte sequence [72 101
   108 108 111 33 33].  If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [18533
   27756 28449 33].  Note the 33 for the last byte.  When looking at the
   values modulo 45, we get [[38 6 9] [36 31 13] [9 2 14] [33 0]] where
   the last byte is represented by two.  By looking up these values in
   the table we get the encoded string "%69 VD92EX0".

   Encoding example 3: The string "base-45" is the byte sequence [98 97
   115 101 45 52 53].  If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [25185
   29541 11572 53].  Note the 53 for the last byte.  When looking at the
   values modulo 45, we get [[30 19 12] [21 26 14] [7 32 5] [8 1]] where
   the last byte is represented by two.  By looking up these values in
   the table we get the encoded string "UJCLQE7W581".

4.2.  Decoding example

   The series of characters are lookup up in Table 1, and the indices
   three and three are interpreted as the numbers

   Decoding example 1: The string "QED8WEX0" represents when lookup in
   Table 1 the values [26 14 13 8 32 14 33 0].  We look at the numbers
   in three number sequences (except last) and get [[26 14 13] [8 32 14]
   [33 0]].  In base 45 we get [26981 29798 33] where the bytes are
   [[105 101] [116 102] [33]].  If we look at the ascii values we get
   the string "ietf!".

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no considerations for IANA in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   When implementing encoding and decoding it is important to be very
   careful so that buffer overflow does not take place, or anything
   similar.  This includes of course the calculations of modulo 45 and
   lookup in the table of characters.  Decoder also must be robust
   regarding input, including proper handling of the NUL character
   (ASCII 0).

   Specifically it should be noted that Base 64 (for example) pad the
   string so that the encoding has the correct number of characters.
   This is something that Base 45 does not do, i.e. Base 45 do not
   include padding.  Because of this, special care is to be taken when
   odd number of octets are to be encoded which results not in N*3
   characters, but (N-1)*3+2 characters in the encoded string and vice
   versa, when the number of encoded characters are not divisible by 3.

   Jakob Schlyter for the feedback.  Also everyone that have been
   working with Base64 during the years that have proven the
   implementions are stable.
