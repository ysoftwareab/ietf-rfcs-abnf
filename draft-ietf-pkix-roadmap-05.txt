Abstract

   This document provides an overview or "roadmap" of the work done by
   the IETF PKIX working group. It describes some of the terminology
   used in the working group's documents, and the theory behind an
   X.509-based Public Key Infrastructure and Privilege Management
   Infrastructure (PMI). It identifies each document developed by the
   PKIX working group, and describes the relationships among the various
   documents. It also provides advice to would-be PKIX implementors
   about some of the issues discussed at length during PKIX development,

INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   in hopes of making it easier to build implementations that will
   actually interoperate.

1 Introduction

1.1 This Document

   This document is an informational Internet draft that provides a
   "roadmap" to the documents produced by the PKIX working group. It is
   intended to provide information; there are no requirements or
   specifications in this document.

   Section 2 of this document defines key terms used in this document.
   Section 3 covers "PKIX theory;" it explains what the PKIX working
   group's basic assumptions were. Section 4 provides an overview of the
   various PKIX documents. It identifies which documents address which
   areas, and describes the relationships among the various documents.
   Section 5 contains "Advice to implementors." Its primary purpose is
   to capture some of the major issues discussed by the PKIX working
   group, as a way of explaining WHY some of the requirements and
   specifications say what they say. This should cut down on the number
   of misinterpretations of the documents, and help developers build
   interoperable implementations. Section 6 contains a list of
   contributors we wish to thank. Section 7 provides a list references.
   Section 8 discusses security considerations, and Section 9 provides
   contact information for the editors. Finally, Section 10 provides a
   disclaimer.

1.2 Changes Since Last Version

   Updated references to current drafts.

   Add references to 2459bis (son-of-rfc 2459), 2510bis, Technical
   Requirements for a Non-Repudiation Service, A String Represenation of
   General Name.

   Revised 5th paragraph in clause 3.2 as per comments.

   Updated clause 5.2.2 as per comments.

   Rewrote clause 5.3 Key Usage to addres more issues with respect to
   the DS and NR bits. Also to change its focus from when to set the
   bits to driving the definition of non-repudiation service
   requirements.

   Added a new clause 5.4 to talk about non-repudiation requirements.

2 Terminology

   There are a number of terms used and misused throughout PKI-related
   and PMI-related literature. To limit confusion caused by some of
   those terms, throughout this document, we will use the following
   terms in the following ways:


     - Attribute Authority (AA) - An authority trusted by one or more
       users to create and sign attribute certificates. It is important
       to note that the AA is responsible for the attribute certificates
       during their whole lifetime, not just for issuing them.

     - Attribute Certificate (AC) - A data structure containing a set of
       attributes for an end-entity and some other information, which is
       digitally signed with the private key of the AA which issued it.

     - Certificate - Can refer to either an AC or a public key
       certificate.  Where there is no distinction made the context
       should be assumed to apply to both an AC and a public key
       certificate.

     - Certification Authority (CA) - An authority trusted by one or
       more users to create and assign public key certificates.
       Optionally the CA may create the user's keys. It is important to
       note that the CA is responsible for the public key certificates
       during their whole lifetime, not just for issuing them.

     - Certificate Policy (CP) - A named set of rules that indicates the
       applicability of a public key certificate to a particular
       community or class of application with common security
       requirements. For example, a particular certificate policy might
       indicate applicability of a type of public key certificate to the
       authentication of electronic data interchange transactions for
       the trading of goods within a given price range.

     - Certification Practice Statement (CPS) - A statement of the
       practices which a CA employs in issuing public key certificates.

     - End-entity - A subject of a certificate who is not a CA in the
       PKIC or an AA in the PMI. (An EE from the PKI can be an AA in the

INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


       PMI.)

     - Public Key Certificate (PKC) - A data structure containing the
       public key of an end-entity and some other information, which is
       digitally signed with the private key of the CA which issued it.

     - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) - The set of hardware, software,
       people, policies and procedures needed to create, manage, store,
       distribute, and revoke PKCs based on public-key cryptography.

     - Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI) - A collection of ACs,
       with their issuing AA's, subjects, relying parties, and
       repositories, is referred to as a Privilege Management
       Infrastructure.

     - Registration Authority (RA) - An optional entity given
       responsibility for performing some of the administrative tasks
       necessary in the registration of subjects, such as: confirming
       the subject's identity; validating that the subject is entitled
       to have the values requested in a PKC; and verifying that the
       subject has possession of the private key associated with the
       public key requested for a PKC.

     - Relying party - A user or agent (e.g., a client or server) who
       relies on the data in a certificate in making decisions.

     - Root CA - A CA that is directly trusted by an EE; that is,
       securely acquiring the value of a Root CA public key requires
       some out-of-band step(s). This term is not meant to imply that a
       Root CA is necessarily at the top of any hierarchy, simply that
       the CA in question is trusted directly.

     - Subordinate CA - A "subordinate CA" is one that is not a Root CA
       for the EE in question. Often, a subordinate CA will not be a
       Root CA for any entity but this is not mandatory.

     - Subject - A subject is the entity (AA, CA, or EE) named in a
       certificate. Subjects can be human users, computers (as
       represented by Domain Name Service (DNS) names or Internet
       Protocol (IP) addresses), or even software agents.

     - Top CA - A CA that is at the top of a PKI hierarchy.

     Note: This is often also called a "Root CA," since in data
     structures terms and in graph theory, the node at the top of a tree
     is the "root." However, to minimize confusion in this document, we
     elect to call this node a "Top CA," and reserve "Root CA" for the
     CA directly trusted by the EE. Readers new to PKIX should be aware



Arsenault & Turner                                              [Page 4]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


     that these terms are not used consistently throughout the PKIX
     documents, as [FORMAT] uses "Root CA" to refer to what this and
     other documents call a "Top CA," and "most-trusted CA" to refer to
     what this and other documents call a "Root CA."


3 PKIX Theory

3.1 Certificate-using Systems

3.1.1 Certificate-using Systems and PKIs

   At the heart of recent efforts to improve Internet security are a
   group of security protocols such as Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions (S/MIME), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Internet
   Protocol Security (IPSec). All of these protocols rely on public-key
   cryptography to provide services such as confidentiality, data
   integrity, data origin authentication, and non-repudiation. The
   purpose of a PKI is to provide trusted and efficient key and public
   key certificate management, thus enabling the use of authentication,
   non-repudiation, and confidentiality.

   Users of public key-based systems must be confident that, any time
   they rely on a public key, the associated private key is owned by the
   subject with which they are communicating. (This applies whether an
   encryption or digital signature mechanism is used.) This confidence
   is obtained through the use of PKCs, which are data structures that
   bind public key values to subjects. The binding is achieved by having
   a trusted CA verify the subject's identity and digitally sign each
   PKC.

   A PKC has a limited valid lifetime, which is indicated in its signed
   contents. Because a PKC's signature and timeliness can be
   independently checked by a certificate-using client, PKCs can be
   distributed via untrusted communications and server systems, and can
   be cached in unsecured storage in certificate-using systems.

   PKCs are used in the process of validating signed data. Specifics
   vary according to which algorithm is used, but the general process
   works as follows:

     Note: there is no specific order in which the checks listed below
     must be made; implementors are free to implement them in the most
     efficient way for their systems.


     - The recipient of signed data verifies that the claimed identity
       of the user is in accordance with the identity contained in the



Arsenault & Turner                                              [Page 5]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


       PKC;

     - The recipient validates that no PKC in the path is revoked (e.g.,
       by retrieving a suitably-current Certificate Revocation List
       (CRL) or querying an on-line certificate status responder), and
       that all PKCs are within their validity periods at the time the
       data was signed;

     - The recipient verifies that the data are not claimed to have any
       values for which the PKC indicates that the signer is not
       authorized;

     - The recipient verifies that the data have not been altered since
       signing, by using the public key in the PKC.

   If all of these checks pass, the recipient can accept that the data
   was signed by the purported signer. The process for keys used for
   encryption is similar.

     Note: It is of course possible that the data was signed by someone
     very different from the signer, if for example the purported
     signer's private key was compromised. Security depends on all parts
     of the certificate-using system, including but not limited to:
     physical security of the place the computer resides; personnel
     security (i.e., the trustworthiness of the people who actually
     develop, install, run, and maintain the system); the security
     provided by the operating system on which the private key is used;
     and the security provided the CA. A failure in any one of these
     areas can cause the entire system security to fail. PKIX is limited
     in scope, however, and only directly addresses issues related to
     the operation of the PKI subsystem. For guidance in many of the
     other areas, see [POLPROC].

3.1.2 Certificate-using Systems and PMIs

   Many systems use the PKC to perform identity based access control
   decisions (i.e., the identity may be used to support identity-based
   access control decisions after the client proves that it has access
   to the private key that corresponds to the public key contained in
   the PKC). For many systems this is sufficient, but increasingly
   systems are beginning to find that rule-based, role-based, and rank-
   based access control is required. These forms of access control
   decisions require additional information that is normally not
   included in a PKC, because the lifetime of the information is much
   shorter than the lifetime of the public-private key pair. To support
   binding this information to a PKC the Attribute Certificate (AC) was
   defined in ANSI and later incorporated into ITU-T Recommendation
   X.509. The AC format allows any additional information to be bound to



Arsenault & Turner                                              [Page 6]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   a PKC by including, in a digitally signed data structure, a reference
   back to one specific PKC or to multiple PKCs, useful when the subject
   has the same identity in multiple PKCs. Additionally, the AC can be
   constructed in such a way that it is only useful at one or more
   particular targets (e.g., web server, mail host).

   Users of a PMI must be confident that the identity purporting to
   posess an attribute has the right to possess that attribute. This
   confidence may be obtained through the use of PKCs or it may be
   configured in the AC-using system. If PKCs are used the party making
   the access control decision can determine "if the AC issuer is
   trusted to issue ACs containing this attribute."

3.2 PKIX History

   In the beginning there was ITU-T Recommendation X.509. It defines a
   widely accepted basis for a PKI, including data formats and
   procedures related to distribution of public keys via PKCs digitally
   signed by CAs. X.509 does not however include a profile to specify
   the support requirements for many of the PKC data structure's sub-
   fields, for any of the extensions, nor for certain data values. PKIX
   was formed in October 1995 to deliver a profile for the Internet PKI
   of X.509 version 3 PKCs and version 2 CRLs. The Internet PKI profile
   [FORMAT] went through eleven draft versions before becoming an RFC.
   Other profiles have been developed in PKIX for particular algorithms
   to make use of [FORMAT]. There has been no sense of conflict between
   the authors that developed these profiles as they are seen as
   complimentary.

   The development of the management protocols has not been so
   straightforward. The Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) was
   developed to define a message protocol that is used between entities
   in a PKI [CMP]. The demand for an enrollment protocol and the desire
   to use PKCS-10 message format as the certificate request syntax lead
   to the development of two different documents in two different
   groups. The Certificate Request Syntax (CRS) draft was developed in
   the SMIME WG which used PKCS-10 [PKCS10] as the certification request
   message format. Certificate Request Message Format [CRMF] draft was
   also developed but in the PKIX WG. It was to define a simple
   enrollment protocol that would subsume both the CMP and CRS
   enrollment protocols, but it did not use PKCS-10 as the certificate
   request message format. Then the certificate management message
   format document, was developed to define an extended set of
   management messages that flow between the components of the Internet
   PKI. Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC) was developed to
   allow the use of an existing protocol (S/MIME) as a PKI management
   protocol, without requiring the development of an entirely new
   protocol such as CMP [CMC]. It also included [PKCS10] as the



Arsenault & Turner                                              [Page 7]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   certificate request syntax, which caused work on the CRS draft to
   stop. Information from the certificate management message format
   document was moved into [CMP] and [CMC] so work on the certificate
   management message format document was discontinued.

   Another long debated topic in the WG dealt with certificate
   revocation. Numerous drafts have been developed to address different
   issues related certificate revocations.  CMP supports revocation
   request, response, revocation announcement, and requests for CRL
   messages. CMC defines revocation request, revocation response, and
   requests for CRL messages, but uses CMS as the encapsulating
   protocol. [OCSP] was developed to address concerns that not all
   relying parties want to go through the process checking CRLs from
   every CA in the certification path. It defines an on-line mechanism
   to determine the status of a given certificate, which may provide
   more timely revocation information than is possible with CRLs. The
   Simple Certification Verification Protocol (SCVP) was produced to
   allow relying parties to off-load all of their certification
   verification to another entity [SCVP]. The WG was arguable split over
   whether such a function should be supported and whether it should be
   its own protocol or included in OCSP. In response, a draft defining
   OCSP Extensions [OCSPX] was produced to include the functions of
   SCVP. One other draft called Open CRL Distribution Point (OCDP) was
   produced which documented two extensions: one to support an
   alternative CRL partitioning mechanism to the CRL Distribution Point
   mechanism documented in [FORMAT] and one to support identifying other
   revocation sources available to certificate-users.  The work from
   this draft was subsumed by an ITU-T | ISO/IEC Amendment to X.509,
   hence work on this draft was halted.

   Development of the operational protocols has been slightly more
   straightforward. Three documents for the Light Weight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) have been developed one for defining LDAPv2 as
   an access protocol to repositories [PKI-LDAPv2]; one for storing PKI
   information in an LDAP directory [SCHEMA]; and one for LDAPv3
   requirements for PKI [PKI-LDAPv3]. Using the File Transfer Protocol
   (FTP) and the Hyper Text Transmission Protocol (HTTP) to retrieve
   PKCs and CRLs from PKI repositories was documented in [FTPHTTP].

   In late 1998 the PKIX charter was revised to include protocols for
   time stamping and data certification services. [TSP] was developed to
   define protocols required to interact with a Time Stamp Authority
   (TSA) who asserts that a datum existed at a given time. [DVCS] allows
   to verify and assert the validity of all signatures attached to the
   signed document using all appropriate status information and PKCs or
   to verify and assert the validity of one or more PKCs at the
   specified time. Both [DVCS] and [TSP] use [CMS] as an encapsulating
   (though in [TSP] request for a time stamp are not required to use



Arsenault & Turner                                              [Page 8]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   [CMS]). [ETNPT] was developed to use [DCVS] to maintain the trust in
   a token issued by a non-repudiation Trusted Third Party (NR TTP)
   after the key initially used to establish trust in the token expires.

   Around the same time, a work item for ACs, defined in [X.509], was
   added. ACs are similar to PKCs, but they do not bind public keys to
   identities rather they bind attributes to identities. The attributes
   bound to the identity can represent anything, but are mostly used to
   support rule-based, role-based, and rank-based access control
   decisions.  Two drafts have since been developed: the Internet
   Attribute Certificates Profile for Authorizations [AC] and the
   Limited AttributeCertificate Acquisition Protocol [LAAP]. The first
   profiles the fields and extensions of the AC and the second provides
   a deliberately limited protocol to access a repository when LDAP is
   not appropriate.

   Other drafts have been produced to address specific issues. [DHPOP]
   was developed to define two mechanisms by which a signature can
   produced using a Diffie-Hellman pair.  This draft provides a
   mechanism to Diffie-Hellam key pairs to issue a PKCS-10 certification
   request. After some operational experience with [CMP], two drafts,
   one for using HTTP as the transport protocol [CMP-HTTP] and one for
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [CMP-TCP], were written to solve
   problems encountered by implementors.

   From the alphabet soup above, it is clear why this roadmap is
   required.

   Note that [FORMAT] and [CMP] are currently being updated based on
   implementation experience, see [2459bis] and [2510bis].

3.3 Overview of the PKIX Approach

3.3.1 PKI

   PKIX is an effort to develop specifications for a PKI for the
   Internet using PKCs. A PKI is defined as:

   The set of hardware, software, people, policies and procedures needed
   to create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke PKCs based on
   public-key cryptography.

   A PKI consists of five types of components [MISPC]:


     - Certification Authorities (CAs) that issue and revoke PKCs;

     - Organizational Registration Authorities (ORAs) that vouch for the
       binding between public keys and certificate holder identities and
       other attributes;

     - Certificate holders that are issued certificates and can sign
       digital documents and encrypt documents;

     - Clients that validate digital signatures and their certification
       paths from a known public key of a trusted CA;

     - Repositories that store and make available certificates and
       Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).


   Figure 1 is a simplified view of the architectural model assumed by
   the PKIX Working Group.

3.3.2 PMI

   PKIX is also an effort to develop specifications for a Privilege
   Management Infrastructure for the Internet using ACs. A Privilege
   Management Infrastructure, or PMI, is defined as:

   The set of hardware, software, people, policies and procedures needed
   to create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke ACs.

   A PMI consists of five types of components [AC]:

     - Attribute Authorities (AAs), or Attribute Certificate Issuer,
       that issue and revoke ACs;

     Note: AAs may implicitly revoke ACs by using very short validity
     periods.

     - Attribute Certificate Users that parses or processes an AC;

     - Attribute Certificate Verifiers that check the validity of an AC
       and then makes use of the result;

     - Clients that request an action for which authorization checks are
       to be made;

     - Repositories that store and make available certificates and
       Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

3.4 Certificates

3.4.1 Public Key Certificates

   ITU-T X.509 (formerly CCITT X.509) or ISO|IEC/ITU 9594-8, which was
   first published in 1988 as part of the X.500 Directory
   recommendations, defines a standard public key certificate format
   [X.509]. The public key certificate format in the 1988 standard is



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 12]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   called the version 1 (v1) format.

   When X.500 was revised in 1993, two more fields,
   subjectUniqueIdentifier and issuerUniqueIdentifier were added,
   resulting in the version 2 (v2) format. These two fields may be used
   to support directory access control.

   The Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) RFCs, published in 1993,
   include specifications for a public key infrastructure based on X.509
   v1 public key certificates [PEM]. The experience gained in attempts
   to deploy [PEM] made it clear that the v1 and v2 public key
   certificate formats are deficient in several respects. Most
   importantly, more fields were needed to carry information which PEM
   design and implementation experience has proven necessary. In
   response to these new requirements, ISO/IEC/ITU and ANSI X9 developed
   the X.509 version 3 (v3) public key certificate format. The v3 format
   extends the v2 format by adding provision for additional extension
   fields. Particular extension field types may be specified in
   standards or may be defined and registered by any organization or
   community. In June 1996, standardization of the basic v3 format was
   completed [X.509].

   ISO/IEC/ITU and ANSI X9 have also developed standard extensions for
   use in the v3 extensions field [X.509][X9.55]. These extensions can
   convey such data as additional subject identification information,
   key attribute information, policy information, and certification path
   constraints. However, the ISO/IEC/ITU and ANSI X9 standard extensions
   are very broad in their applicability. In order to develop
   interoperable implementations of X.509 v3 systems for Internet use,
   it is necessary to specify a profile for use of the X.509 v3
   extensions tailored for the Internet. It is one goal of PKIX to
   specify a profile for Internet, electronic mail, and IPSec
   applications, etc. Environments with additional requirements may
   build on this profile or may replace it.

3.4.2 Attribute Certificates

   ANSI X.9 first published the Attribute Certificate format in [put
   date in here] as part of [put reference in here]. It defined the
   standard version 1 (v1) AC format. They later created a version 2
   (v2) AC by modifying the owner field to point to either an identity
   or a specific PKC and including an extension mechanism. In 1997 ITU-T
   included it in [X.509].

   ANSI, ITU-T, and IETF have developed standard extensions and
   attributes for use in the v2 ACs. Extensions can convey such
   informatoin as an audit identity that can be used to create an audit
   trail, identity specific servers and services where the AC owner can



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 13]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   use their AC, point to a specific issuer's key, and indicate where to
   get revocation information. The AC is generic enough to allow any
   attribute to be conveyed in the data structure. Without limiting the
   attributes and extensions that can be included in an AC it is very
   difficult to develop interoperable implementations for Internet use.
   It is the goal of PKIX to specify a profile for the Internet,
   electronic mail, IPSec applications, etc. Environments with
   additional requirements may build on this profile or replace it.

3.5 Functions of a PKI

   This section describes the major functions of a PKI. In some cases,
   PKIs may provide extra functions.

3.5.1 Registration

   This is the process whereby a subject first makes itself known to a
   CA (directly, or through an RA), prior to that CA issuing a PKC or
   PKCs for that subject. Registration involves the subject providing
   its name (e.g., common name, fully-qualified domain name, IP
   address), and other attributes to be put in the PKC, followed by the
   CA (possibly with help from the RA) verifying in accordance with its
   Certification Practice Statement (CPS) that the name and other
   attributes are correct.

3.5.2 Initialization

   Initialization is when the subject (e.g., the user or client system)
   gets the values needed to begin communicating with the PKI. For
   example, initialization can involve providing the client system with
   the public key or PKC of a CA, or generating the client system's own
   public-private key pair.

3.5.3 Certification

   This is the process in which a CA issues a PKC for a subject's public
   key, and returns that PKC to the subject or posts that PKC in a
   repository.

3.5.4 Key Pair Recovery

   In some implementations, key exchange or encryption keys will be
   required by local policy to be "backed up," or recoverable in case
   the key is lost and access to previously-encrypted information is
   needed. Such implementations can include those where the private key
   exchange key is stored on a hardware token which can be lost or
   broken, or when a private key file is protected by a password which
   can be forgotten. Often, a company is concerned about being able to



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 14]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   read mail encrypted by or for a particular employee when that
   employee is no longer available because she is ill or no longer works
   for the company.

   In these cases, the user's private key can be backed up by a CA or by
   a separate key backup system. If a user or her employer needs to
   recover these backed up key materials, the PKI must provide a system
   that permits the recovery without providing an unacceptable risk of
   compromise of the private key.

3.5.5 Key Generation

   Depending on the CA's policy, the private-public key pair can either
   be generated by the user in his local environment, or generated by
   the CA. In the latter case, the key material may be distributed to
   the user in an encrypted file or on a physical token (e.g., a smart
   card or PCMCIA card).

3.5.6 Key Update

   All key pairs need to be updated regularly (i.e., replaced with a new
   key pair) and new PKCs issued. This will happen in two cases:
   normally, when a key has passed its maximum usable lifetime; and
   exceptionally, when a key has been compromised and must be replaced.

3.5.6.1 Key Expiry

   In the normal case, a PKI needs to provide a facility to gracefully
   transition from a PKC with an existing key to a new PKC with a new
   key. This is particularly true when the key to be updated is that of
   a CA. Users will know in advance that the key will expire on a
   certain date; the PKI, working together with PKC-using applications,
   should allow for appropriate keys to work before and after the
   transition. There are a number of ways to do this; see [CMP] for an
   example of one.

3.5.6.2 Key Compromise

   In the case of a key compromise, the transition will not be
   "graceful" in that there will be an unplanned switch of PKCs and
   keys; users will not have known in advance what was about to happen.
   Still, the PKI must support the ability to declare that the previous
   PKC is now invalid and shall not be used, and to announce the
   validity and availability of the new PKC.

     Note: compromise of a private key associated with a Root CA is
     catastrophic for users relying on that Root CA. If a Root CA's
     private key is compromised, that CA's PKC must be revoked and all



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 15]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


     PKCs subordinate to it must also be revoked. Until such time as the
     Root CA has been issued a new PKC and the Root CA issues PKCs to
     users relying upon it, users relying on that Root CA are cut off
     from the rest of the system, as there is no way to develop a valid
     certification path back to a trusted node.

   Further, users will likely have to be notified by out-of-band
   mechanisms about the change in CA keys. If the old key is
   compromised, any "update" message telling subordinates to switch to a
   new key could have come from an attacker in possession of the old
   key, and could point to a new public key for which the attacker
   already has the private key. It is possible to have anticipated this
   event, and "pre-placed" replacement Root CA keys with all relying
   parties, but some secure, out-of-band mechanism will have to be used
   to tell users to make the switch, and this will only help if the
   replacement key has not been compromised.

   Additionally, once the Root CA is brought back up with a new key, it
   will likely be necessary to re-issue PKCs, signed with the new key,
   to all subordinate users, since their current PKC would be signed
   with a now-revoked key.

3.5.7 Cross-certification

   A cross-certificate is a PKC issued by one CA to another CA which
   contains a public CA key associated with the private CA signature key
   used for issuing PKCs. Typically, a cross-certificate is used to
   allow client systems orend entities in one administrative domain to
   communicate securely with client systems or end users in another
   administrative domain. Use of a cross-certificate issued from CA_1 to
   CA_2 allows user Alice, who trusts CA_1, to accept a PKC used by Bob,
   which was issued by CA_2. Cross-certificates can also be issued from
   one CA to another CA in the same administrative domain, if required.

   Cross-certificates can be issued in only one direction, or in both
   directions, between two CA's. That is, just because CA_1 issues a
   cross-certificate for CA_2, CA_2 does not have to issue a cross-
   certificate for CA_1.

3.5.8 Revocation

   When a PKC is issued, it is expected to be in use for its entire
   validity period. However, various circumstances may cause a PKC to
   become invalid prior to the expiration of the validity period. Such
   circumstances include change of name, change of association between
   subject and CA (e.g., an employee terminates employment with an
   organization), and compromise or suspected compromise of the
   corresponding private key. Under such circumstances, the CA needs to



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 16]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   revoke the PKC.

   X.509 defines one method of PKC revocation. This method involves each
   CA periodically issuing a signed data structure called a certificate
   revocation list (CRL). A CRL is a time stamped list identifying
   revoked PKCs which is signed by a CA and made freely available in a
   public repository. Each revoked PKC is identified in a CRL by its PKC
   serial number. When a certificate-using system uses a PKC, that
   system not only checks the PKC signature and validity but also
   acquires a suitably-recent CRL and checks that the PKC serial number
   is not on that CRL. The meaning of "suitably-recent" may vary with
   local policy, but it usually means the most recently-issued CRL. A CA
   issues a new CRL on a regular periodic basis (e.g., hourly, daily, or
   weekly). CA's may also issue CRLs aperiodically. For example, if an
   important key is deemed compromised, the CA may issue a new CRL to
   expedite notification of that fact, even if the next CRL does not
   have to be issued for some time. (A problem of aperiodic CRL issuance
   is that end-entities may not know that a new CRL has been issued, and
   thus may not retrieve it from a repository.)

   An entry is added to the CRL as part of the next update following
   notification of revocation. An entry may be removed from the CRL
   after appearing on one regularly scheduled CRL issued beyond the
   revoked PKC's validity period. Leaving the revoked PKC on the CRL for
   this extra period allows for PKCs that are revoked prior to issuing a
   new CRL and whose invalidity date falls before the CRL issuing time
   to be accounted for. If the revoked PKC is not retained on the CRL
   for this extra period then the possibility arises that a revoked PKC
   may never appear on a CRL.

   An advantage of the CRL revocation method is that CRLs may be
   distributed by exactly the same means as PKCs themselves, namely, via
   untrusted communications and server systems.

   One limitation of the CRL revocation method, using untrusted
   communications and servers, is that the time granularity of
   revocation is limited to the CRL issue period. For example, if a
   revocation is reported now, that revocation will not be reliably
   notified to certificate-using systems until the next CRL is issued -
   this may be up to one hour, one day, or one week depending on the
   frequency that the CA issues CRLs.

   As with the X.509 v3 PKC format, in order to facilitate interoperable
   implementations from multiple vendors, the X.509 v2 CRL format needed
   to be profiled for Internet use. This was done as part of [FORMAT].
   However, PKIX does not require CAs to issue CRLs. On-line methods of
   revocation notification may be applicable in some environments as an
   alternative to the X.509 CRL. PKIX defines a protocol known as OCSP



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 17]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   to facilitate on-line checking of the status of PKCs [OCSP].

   On-line revocation checking may significantly reduce the latency
   between a revocation report and the distribution of the information
   to relying parties. Once the CA accepts the report as authentic and
   valid, any query to the on-line service will correctly reflect the
   PKC validation impacts of the revocation. However, these methods
   impose new security requirements; the PKC validator must trust the
   on-line validation service while the repository does not need to be
   trusted.

3.5.9 Certificate and Revocation Notice Distribution and Publication

   As alluded to in sections 3.1 and 3.5.8 above, the PKI is responsible
   for the distribution of PKCs and PKC revocation notices (whether in
   CRL form or in some other form) in the system. "Distribution" of PKCs
   includes transmission of the PKC to its owner, and may also include
   publication of the PKC in a repository. "Distribution" of revocation
   notices may involve posting CRLs in a repository, transmitting them
   to end-entities, or forwarding them to on-line responders.

3.6 Parts of PKIX

   This section identifies the five different areas in which the PKIX
   working group has developed documents. The first area involves
   profiles of the X.509 v3 PKC standards and the X.509 v2 CRL standards
   for the Internet. The second area involves operational protocols, in
   which relying parties can obtain information such as PKCs or PKC
   status. The third area covers management protocols, in which
   different entities in the system exchange information needed for
   proper management of the PKI. The fourth area provides information
   about certificate policies and certificate practice statements,
   covering the areas of PKI security not directly addressed in the rest
   of PKIX. The fifth area deals with providing time stamping and data
   certification services, which can be used to build such services as
   non-repudiation.

3.6.1 Profiles

   An X.509 v3 PKC is a very complex data structure. It consists of
   basic information fields, plus a number of optional extensions. Many
   of the fields and numerous extensions can take on a wide range of
   options. This provides an enormous degree of flexibility, which
   allows the X.509 v3 PKC format to be used with a wide range of
   applications in a wide range of environments. Unfortunately, this
   same flexibility makes it extremely difficult to produce independent
   implementations that will actually interoperate with one another. In
   order to build an Internet PKI based on X.509 v3 PKCs, the PKIX



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 18]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   working group had to develop a profile of the X.509 v3 PKC
   specification.

   A profile of the X.509 v3 PKC specification is a description of the
   contents of the PKC and which extensions must be supported, which
   extensions may be supported, and which extensions may not be
   supported. [FORMAT] provides such a profile of X.509 v3 PKC for the
   Internet PKI. In addition, [FORMAT] suggests ranges of values for
   many of the extensions.

   [FORMAT] also provides a profile for Version 2 CRLs for use in the
   Internet PKI. CRLs, like PKCs, have a number of optional extensions.
   In order to promote interoperability, it is necessary to constrain
   the choices an implementor supports.

   In addition to profiling the PKC and CRL formats, it is necessary to
   define particular Object Identifiers (OIDs) for certain encryption
   algorithms, because there are a variety of OIDs registered for some
   algorithm suites. Many of the OIDs are defined in [FORMAT] to promote
   interoperability. Also, PKIX has produced two documents ([ECDSA] and
   [KEA]) which provide guidance on the proper implementation of
   specific algorithms.

   Some countries are in a process of updating their legal frameworks in
   order to regulate and incorporate recognition of signatures in
   electronic form. Many of these frameworks introduce certain basic
   requirements on PKCs, often termed Qualified Certificates, supporting
   these types of "legal" signatures. Partly as a result of this there
   is a need for a specific PKC profile providing standardized support
   for certain related issues such as a common structure for expressing
   unambiguous identities of certified subjects (unmistakable identity).
   In December 1998, PKIX adopted as a work item the development of a
   refinement of [RFC2459] that further profiles PKIX PKC into qualified
   certificates. This work is reflected in [QC].

   Like the X.509 v3 PKC, the AC also a very complex data structure
   consisting of basic information fields, a number of optional
   extensions, and a virtually unlimited number of attributes. Again,
   many of the fields, extensions, and attributes can take on a wide
   range of options allowing an enormous degree of flexibility. In order
   to build an Internet PMI based on ACs, the PKIX working group had to
   develop a profile of the AC.

   The AC profile is description of the contents of the AC, the allowed
   and required extensions, and applicable attributes. [AC] provides
   such a profile of the X.509 v2 AC.

3.6.2 Operational Protocols

   Operational protocols are required to deliver certificates and CRLs
   (or other certificate status information) to certificate using
   systems. Provision is needed for a variety of different means of
   certificate and CRL delivery, including distribution procedures based
   on LDAP, HTTP, FTP, and X.500. Operational protocols supporting these
   functions are defined in [FTPHTTP], [OCSP], [PKI-LDAPv2], and [PKI-
   LDAPv3]. A limited protocol to support AC retrieval has also been
   document in [LAAP].

   [DHPOP] defines a procedure for producing signatures withg the
   Diffie-Hellman key agreement algorithm. This signature mechanism was
   developed to support PKCS-10 certificate requests.

3.6.3 Management Protocols

   Management protocols are required to support on-line interactions
   between PKI user and management entities. For example, a management
   protocol might be used between a CA and a client system with which a
   key pair is associated, or between two CAs which cross-certify each
   other. A management protocol can be used to carry user or client
   system registration information, or a request for revocation of a
   certificate.

   There are two parts to a "management protocol." The first is the
   format of the messages that will be sent, and the second is the
   actual protocol that governs the transmission of those messages.
   Originally, the PKIX working group developed two documents, [CRMF]
   and certificate management message format (CMMF), that together
   described the necessary set of message formats, and two other
   documents, [CMP] and [CMC], that described protocols for exchanging
   those messages. However, the message formats defined in the CMMF
   draft were inserted into both [CMP] and [CMC], and thus the (CMMF)
   draft has been dropped as a PKIX document.

   [CMP-HTTP] and [CMP-TCP] were developed, after some implementation
   experience, to update the procedure documented in [CMP] for using CMP
   with HTTP and TCP and the transport protocols [CMP].

3.6.4 Policy Outline

   As mentioned before, profiling certificates and specifying
   operational and management protocols only addresses a part of the
   problem of actually developing and implementing a secure PKI. What is
   also needed is the development of a certificate policy (CP) and
   certification practice statement (CPS), and then following those
   documents. The CP and CPS should address physical and personnel

INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   security, subject identification requirements, revocation policy, and
   a number of other topics. [POLPROC] provides a framework for
   certification practice statements.

3.6.5 Time-Stamp, Data Verification, and Data Certification Services

   In late 1998, the PKIX working group began two efforts that were not
   in the original working group charter, but were deemed to be
   appropriate because they described infrastructure services that could
   be used to provide desired security services. The first of these is
   time stamping, described in [TSP]. Time stamping is a service in
   which a trusted third party - a Time Stamp Authority, or TSA - signs
   a message, in order to provide evidence that it existed prior to a
   given time. Time stamping provides some support for non-repudiation,
   in that a user cannot claim that a transaction was later forged after
   compromise of a private key, because the existence of the signed time
   stamp indicates that the transaction in question could not have been
   created after the indicated time.

   [TSP] also defines the role of a Temporal Data Authority, or TDA. A
   TDA is a Trusted Third Party (TTP) that creates a temporal data
   token. This temporal data token associates a message with a
   particular event and provides supplementary evidence for the time
   included in the time stamp token. For example, a TDA could associate
   the message with the most recent closing value of the Dow Jones
   Average. The temporal data with which the message is associated
   should be unpredictable in order to prevent forward dating of tokens.
   The third iteration of the draft removed support for TDAs as no one
   in the WG expressed a requirement for the role.

   At the Minneapolis IETF meeting, it was disclosed that the materials
   covered in [TSP] draft may be covered by patent(s). Use of the
   material covered by the patent(s) in question has not be granted by
   the patent holder. Thus, anyone interested in implementing the PKIX
   [TSP] draft must be aware of this intellectual property issue.

   The second new effort is the definition of a Data Validation and
   Certification Server, or DVCS, protocol [DVCS]. A DVCS is a Trusted
   Third Party that verifies the correctness of specific data submitted
   to it. It also allows the delegation of trustworthy servers and
   allows for chaining of verifications.

   This services offered by DVCS are different from the TSP service in
   that a TSA will not attempt to parse or verify a message sent to it
   for certification; instead, it will merely append a reliable
   indication of the current time, and sign the resulting string-of-
   bits. This offers an indication that the given string-of-bits existed
   at a specified time; it does not offer any indication of the



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 21]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   correctness or relevance of that string of bits. By contrast, the
   DVCS certifies possession of data or the validity of another entity's
   signature. As part of this, the DVCS verifies the mathematical
   correctness of the actual signature value contained in the request
   and also checks the full certification path from the signing entity
   to a trusted point (e.g., the DVCS's CA, or the Root CA in a
   hierarchy).

   The DVCS supports non-repudiation in two ways. First, it provides
   evidence that a signature or PKC was valid at the time indicated in
   the token. The token can be used even after the corresponding PKC
   expires and its revocation information is no longer available on CRLs
   (for example). Second, the production of a data certification token
   in response to a signed request for certification of another
   signature or PKC also provides evidence that due diligence was
   performed by the requester in validating the signature or PKC.

4 PKIX Documents

   This section describes each of the documents written by the PKIX
   working group. As PKIX progresses, this section will need to be
   continually updated to reflect the status of each document (e.g.,
   Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, Standard, Informational Draft,
   Informational RFC, something-that-was-just-thrown-out-for-
   consideration, etc.).

4.1 Profile

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and CRL Profile (RFC 2459)

   DESCRIPTION: This document describes the profiles to be used for
   X.509 v3 PKCs and version 2 CRLs by Internet PKI participants. The
   profiles include the identification of ISO/IEC/ITU and ANSI
   extensions which may be useful in the Internet PKI. The profiles are
   presented in the 1988 Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) rather
   than the 1994 syntax used in the ISO/IEC/ITU standards. Would-be PKIX
   implementors and developers of certificate-using applications should
   start with [FORMAT] to ensure that their systems will be able to
   interoperate with other users of the PKI.

   [FORMAT] also includes path validation procedures. The procedures
   presented are based upon the ISO/IEC/ITU definition, but the
   presentation assumes one or more self-signed trusted CA PKCs. The
   procedures are provided as examples only. Implementations are not
   required to use the procedures provided; they may implement whichever
   procedures are efficient for their situation. However,
   implementations are required to derive the same results as the

   Qualified Certificates. A "Qualified Certificate" is a PKC that is
   issued to a natural person (i.e., a living human being); contains an
   unmistakable identity based on a real name or a pseudonym of the
   subject; exclusively indicates non-repudiation as the key usage for
   the certificate's public key; and meets a number of requirements.

4.2 Operational Protocols

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational
   Protocols - LDAPv2 (RFC 2559)

   DESCRIPTION: This document describes the use of LDAPv2 as a protocol
   for PKI elements to publish and retrieve certificates and CRLs from a
   repository. [LDAPv2] is a protocol that allows publishing and
   retrieving of information.

   STATUS: Proposed Standard.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure LDAPv2
   Schema (RFC 2587)

   DESCRIPTION: This document defines a minimal schema necessary to
   support the use of LDAPv2 for PKC and CRL retrieval and related
   functions for PKIX. This document supplements [LDAPv2] by identifying
   the PKIX-related attributes that must be present.

   Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP (RFC 2560)




Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 24]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   DESCRIPTION: This document specifies a protocol useful in determining
   the current status of a certificate without the use of CRLs. A major
   complaint about certificate-based systems is the need for a relying
   party to retrieve a current CRL as part of the certificate validation
   process. Depending on the size of the CRL, this can cause severe
   problems for bandwidth-challenged devices. Depending on the frequency
   of CRL issuance, this can also cause timeliness problems. (E.g., if
   CRLs are only published weekly, with no interim releases, a
   certificate could actually have been revoked for just short of one
   week without it being on the current CRL, and thus improper use of
   that certificate could still be occurring.)

   OCSP attempts to address those problems. It provides a mechanism
   whereby a relying party identifies one or more certificates to an
   approved OCSP "responder", and the responder sends back the current
   status of the certificate(s) - e.g., "revoked", "notRevoked",
   "unknown". This can dramatically reduce the bandwidth required to
   transmit revocation status - a relying party does not have to
   retrieve a CRL of many entries to check the status of one
   certificate. It can (although it is not guaranteed to) improve the
   timeliness of revocation notification, and thus reduce the window of
   opportunity for someone trying to use a revoked certificate.

   STATUS: Proposed Standard.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational
   Protocols: FTP and HTTP (RFC 2585)

   DESCRIPTION: This document describes the use of the File Transfer
   Protocol (FTP) and the Hyper-text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to obtain
   certificates and CRLs from PKI repositories.

   STATUS: Proposed Standard.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Diffie-Hellman Proof-of-Possession Algorithms <draft-
   ietf-pkix-dhpop-02.txt>

   DESCRIPTION: This documents describes two signing algorithms using
   the Diffie-Hellman key agreement process to provide a shared secret
   as the basis of the signature. It allows Diffie-Hellman, a key
   agreement algorithm, to be used instead of requiring that the public
   key being requested for certification correspond to an algorithm that
   is capable of signing and encrypting. The first algorithm generates a
   signature for a specific verifier where the signer and recipient have
   the same public key parameters. The second algorithm generates a
   signature for arbitrary verifiers where the signer and recipient do
   not have the same public key parameters.

4.3 Management Protocols

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Certificate Management Messages over CMS <draft-ietf-
   pkix-cmc-05.txt>

   DESCRIPTION: This document defines the means by which PKI clients and
   servers may exchange PKI messages when using S/MIME's Cryptographic
   Message Syntax [CMS] as a transaction envelope. CMC supports the
   certificate request message body specified in the Certificate Request
   Message Format [CRMF] documents, as well as a variety of other
   certificate management messages. The primary purpose of this
   specification is to allow the use of an existing protocol (S/MIME) as
   a PKI management protocol, without requiring the development of an
   entirely new protocol such as CMP. A secondary purpose is to codify
   in IETF standards the current industry practice of using PKCS-10
   messages [PKCS10] for certificate requests.

   STATUS: IETF Last Call.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Certificate Request Message Format
   (RFC 2511)

   DESCRIPTION: CRMF specifies a format recommended for use whenever a
   relying party is requesting a certificate from a CA or requesting
   that an RA help it get a certificate. The request message format was
   needed before many of the other message formats had to be finalized,
   and so it was put into a separate document. This document only
   specifies the format of a message. Specification of a protocol to
   transport that message is beyond the scope of CRMF.

   STATUS: Proposed Standard.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   Management Protocols (RFC 2510)

   DESCRIPTION: This document specifies a new protocol specifically
   developed for the purpose of transporting messages like those
   specified in CRMF among PKI elements. In general, CMP will be used in
   conjunction with CRMF, and will then be run over a transfer service
   (e.g., S/MIME, HTTP) to provide a complete PKI management service.

   DESCRIPTION: This document describes how to layer [CMP] over [HTTP].
   A simple method for doing so is described in [CMP], but that method
   does not accommodate a polling mechanism, which may be required in
   some environments. This document specifies an alternative method
   which uses the polling protocol defined in [CMP]. A new Content-Type
   for messages is also defined.

   STATUS: Under WG review.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Using TCP as a Transport Protocol for CMP <draft-
   ietf-pkix-cmp-tcp-00.txt>

   DESCRIPTION: This document describes how to layer Certificate
   Management Protocols [CMP] over [TCP]. A method for doing so is
   described in [CMP], but that method does not solve problems
   encountered by implementors. This document specifies an enhanced
   method which extends the protocol.

   Policy and Certification Practices Framework (RFC 2527)

   DESCRIPTION: As noted before, the specification and implementation of
   certificate profiles, operational protocols, and management protocols
   is only part of building a PKI. Equally as important - if not more
   important - is the development and enforcement of a certificate
   security policy, and a Certification Practice Statement (CPS). The
   purpose of this document (PKIX-4) is to establish a clear
   relationship between certificate policies and CPSs, and to present a
   framework to assist the writers of certificate policies or CPSs with
   their tasks. In particular, the framework identifies the elements
   that may need to be considered in formulating a certificate policy or
   a CPS. The purpose is not to define particular certificate policies
   or CPSs, per se.

   STATUS: Informational RFC.

4.5 Time-Stamp, Data Validation, and Data Certification Services

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time Stamp
   Protocols <draft-ietf-pkix-time-stamp-06.txt>

   DESCRIPTION: This document defines the specification for a time stamp
   service. It defines a Time Stamp Authority, or TSA, a trusted third
   party who maintains a reliable time service. When the TSA receives a
   time stamp request, it appends the current time to the request and
   signs it into a token to certify that the original request existed
   prior to the indicated time. This helps provide non-repudiation by
   preventing someone (either a legitimate user or an attacker who has
   successfully compromised a key) from "back-dating" a transaction. It
   also makes it more difficult to challenge a transaction by asserting
   that it has been back-dated. Note that the TSA does not provide any
   data parsing service; that is, the TSA does not attempt to validate
   that which it signs; it merely regards it as a string of bits whose
   meaning is unimportant, but existence is vital.

   STATUS: In WG Last.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Data
   Certification Server Protocols <draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-04.txt>

   DESCRIPTION: This document defines a data validation and
   certification service, or DVCS, which can be used to certify both the
   existence and correctness of a message or signature. In contrast to
   the time stamp service described above, the DVCS certifies possession
   of data or the validity of another entity's signature. As part of
   this, the DVCS verifies the mathematical correctness of the actual
   signature value contained in the request and also checks the full



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 29]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   certification path from the signing entity to a trusted point (e.g.,
   the DVCS's CA, or the Root CA in a hierarchy).

   The DVCS supports non-repudiation in two ways. First, it provides
   evidence that a signature or public key certificate was valid at the
   time indicated in the token. The token can be used even after the
   corresponding public key certificate expires and its revocation
   information is no longer available on CRLs (for example). Second, the
   production of a data certification token in response to a signed
   request for certification of another signature or public key
   certificate also provides evidence that due diligence was performed
   by the requester in validating the signature or public key
   certificate.

   STATUS: Under WG review.

   DOCUMENT TITLE: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Technical
   Requirements for a non-Repudiation Service <draft-ietf-pkix-
   technr-01.txt>

   DESCRIPTION: This document describes those features of a service
   which processes signed documents which must be present in order for
   that service to constitute a "technical non-repudiation" service.  A
   technical non-repudiation service must permit an independent verifier
   to determine whether a given signature was applied to a given data
   object by the private key associated with a given valid certificate,
   at a time later than the signature.  The features of a technical non-
   repudiation service are expected to be necessary for a full non-
   repudiation service, although they may not be sufficient.

   This document is intended to clarify the definition of the "non-
   repudiation" service in RFC 2459.  It should thus serve as a guide to
   when the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage extension should be set
   and to when a Certificate Authority is required to archive CRL's.

5 Advice to Implementors

   This section provides guidance to those who would implement various
   parts of the PKIX suite of documents. The topics discussed in this
   section engendered significant discussion in the working group, and
   there, was at times, either widespread disagreement or widespread
   misunderstanding of them. Thus, this discussion is provided to help
   readers of the PKIX document set understand these issues, in the hope
   of fostering greater interoperability among eventual PKIX
   implementations.

5.1 Names

   PKIX has been referred to as a "name-centric" PKI because the PKCs
   associate public keys with names of entities. Each PKC contains at
   least one name for the owner of a particular public key. The name can
   be an X.500 distinguished name, contained in the subjectDN field of
   the PKC. There can also be names such as RFC822 e-mail addresses, DNS
   domain names, and uniform resource identifiers (URIs) associated with
   the key; these attributes are kept in the subjectAltName extension of
   the PKC. A PKC must contain at least one of these name forms, it may
   contain multiple forms if deemed appropriate by the CA based on the
   intended usage of the PKC.

5.1.1 Name Forms

   There are two possible places to put a name in an X.509 v3 PKC. One
   is the subject field in the base PKC (often called the "Distinguished
   Name" or "DN" field), and the other is in the subjectAltName
   extension.

5.1.1.1 Distinguished Names




Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 32]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   According to [FORMAT], a CA's PKC must have a non-null value in the
   subject field, while EE's PKCs are permitted to have an empty subject
   field. If a PKC has a non-null subject field, it MUST contain an
   X.500 Distinguished Name.

5.1.1.2 SubjectAltName Forms

   In addition to the DN, a PKIX PKC may have one or more values in the
   subjectAltName extension.

   The subjectAltName extension allows additional identities to be bound
   to the subject of the PKC (e.g., it allows "umbc.edu" and
   "130.85.1.3" to be associated with a particular subject, as well as
   "C=US, O=University of Maryland, L=Baltimore, CN=UMBC").
   X.509-defined options for this extension include: Internet electronic
   mail addresses; DNS names; IP addresses; and URIs. Other options can
   exist, including locally-defined name forms.

   A single subjectAltName extension can include multiple name forms,
   and multiple instances of each name form.

   Whenever such alternate name forms are to be bound into a PKC, the
   subjectAltName (or issuerAltName) extension must be used. It is
   technically possible to embed an alternate name form in the subject
   field. For example, one could make a DN contain an IP address via a
   kludge such as "C=US, L=Baltimore, CN=130.85.1.3". However, this
   usage is deprecated; the alternative name extension is the preferred
   location for finding such information. As another example, some
   legacy implementations exist where an RFC822 name is embedded in the
   subject distinguished name as an EmailAddress attribute. Per
   [FORMAT], PKIX-compliant implementations generating new PKCs with
   electronic mail addresses MUST use the rfc822Name in the
   subjectAltName extension to describe such EEs. Simultaneous inclusion
   of the EmailAddress attribute in the subject distinguished name to
   support legacy implementation is deprecated but permitted.

   In line with this, if the only subject identity included in a PKC is
   an alternative name form, then the subject distinguished name must be
   empty (technically, an empty sequence), and the subjectAltName
   extension must be present. If the subject field contains an empty
   sequence, the subjectAltName extension must be marked critical.

   If the subjectAltName extension is present, the sequence must contain
   at least one entry. Unlike the subject field, conforming CAs shall
   not issue PKCs with subjectAltNames containing empty GeneralName
   fields. For example, an rfc822Name is represented as an IA5String.
   While an empty string is a valid IA5String, such an rfc822Name is not
   permitted by PKIX. The behavior of clients that encounter such a PKC



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 33]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   when processing a certification path is not defined by this working
   group.

   Because the subject's alternative name is considered to be
   definitively bound to the public key, all parts of the subject's
   alternative name must be verified by the CA.

5.1.1.2.1 Internet e-mail addresses

   When the subjectAltName extension contains an Internet mail address,
   the address is included as an rfc822Name. The format of an rfc822Name
   is an "addr-spec" as defined in [RFC-822]. An addr-spec has the form
   local-part@domain; it does not have a phrase (such as a common name)
   before it, or a comment (text surrounded in parentheses) after it,
   and it is not surrounded by "<" and ">".

5.1.1.2.2 DNS Names

   When the subjectAltName extension contains a domain name service
   label, the domain name is stored in the dNSName attribute(an
   IA5String). The string shall be in the "preferred name syntax," as
   specified by [DNS]. Note that while upper and lower case letters are
   allowed in domain names, no significance is attached to the case. In
   addition, while the string " " is a legal domain name, subjectAltName
   extensions with a dNSName " " are not permitted. Finally, the use of
   the DNS representation for Internet mail addresses (wpolk.nist.gov
   instead of wpolk@nist.gov) is not permitted; such identities are to
   be encoded as rfc822Name.

5.1.1.2.3 IP addresses

   When the subjectAltName extension contains an iPAddress, the address
   shall be stored in the octet string in "network byte order," as
   specified in [IP]. The least significant bit (LSB) of each octet is
   the LSB of the corresponding byte in the network address. For IP
   Version 4, as specified in [IP], the octet string must contain
   exactly four octets. For IP Version 6, as specified in [IPv6], the
   octet string must contain exactly sixteen octets.

5.1.1.2.4 URIs

   [FORMAT] notes "When the subjectAltName extension contains a URI, the
   name MUST be stored in the uniformResourceIdentifier (an IA5String).
   The name MUST be a non-relative URL, and MUST follow the URL syntax
   and encoding rules specified in [RFC 1738]. The name must include
   both a scheme (e.g., "http" or "ftp") and a scheme-specific-part. The
   scheme-specific-part must include a fully qualified domain name or IP
   address as the host. As specified in [RFC 1738], the scheme name is



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 34]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   not case-sensitive (e.g., "http" is equivalent to "HTTP"). The host
   part is also not case-sensitive, but other components of the scheme-
   specific-part may be case-sensitive. When comparing URIs, conforming
   implementations MUST compare the scheme and host without regard to
   case, but assume the remainder of the scheme-specific-part is case
   sensitive."

5.1.2 Scope of Names

   The original X.500 work presumed that every subject in the world
   would have a globally-unique distinguished name. Thus, every subject
   could be easily located, and there would never be a conflict. All
   that would be needed is a sufficiently-large name space, and rules
   for constructing names based on subordination and location.

   Obviously, that is not practical in the real world, for a variety of
   reasons. There is no single entity in the world trusted by everybody
   to reside at the top of the name space, and there is no way to
   enforce uniqueness on names for all entities. (These were among the
   reasons for the failure of PEM to be widely implemented.)

   This does not mean, however, that a name-based PKI cannot work. It is
   important to recognize that the scope of names in PKIX is local; they
   need to be defined and unique only within their own domain.

   Suppose for example that a Top CA is established with DN "O=IETF,
   OU=PKIX, CN=PKIX_CA". That CA will then issue PKCs for subjects
   subordinate to it. The only requirement, which can be enforced
   procedurally, is that no two distinct entities beneath this Top CA
   have the same name. We can't prevent somebody else in the world from
   creating her own CA, called "O=IETF, OU=PKIX, CN=PKIX_CA", and it is
   not necessary to do so. Within the domain of the original Top CA,
   there will be no conflict, and the fact that there is another CA of
   the same name in some other domain is irrelevant.

   This is analogous to the current DNS or IP address situations. On the
   Internet, there is only one node called www.ietf.org. The fact that
   there might be 10 different intranets, each with a host given the DNS
   name www.ietf.org, is irrelevant and causes no interoperability
   problems - those are different domains. However, if there were to be
   another node on the Internet with domain name www.ietf.org, then
   there would be a problem due to name duplication.

   The same applies for IP addresses. As long as only one node on the
   Internet responds to the IP address 130.85.1.3, there is no problem,
   despite the fact that there are 100 different corporate Intranets,
   each using that same IP address. However, if two different nodes on
   the Internet each responded to the IP address 130.85.1.3, there would



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 35]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   be a problem.

5.1.3 Certificate Path Construction

   Certificate path construction has been the topic of many discussions
   in the WG. The issue centered around how best to get a certificate
   when the connection between the subject's name and the name of their
   CA, as well as the CA's repository (or directory), may not be
   obvious. Many proposals were put forth, including implementing a
   global X.500 Directory Service, using DNS SRV records, and using an
   extension to point to the directory provider. At the end of the
   discussion the group decided to use the authority information access
   extension defined in [FORMAT], which allows the CA to indicate the
   access method and location of CA information and services. The
   extension would be included in subject's certificates and could be
   used to associate an Internet style identity for the location of
   repository to retrieve the issuer's certificate in cases where such a
   location is not related to the issuer's name.

   Another discussion related to certificate path construction was where
   to store the CA and EE PKCs in the directory (specifically LDAPv2
   directories). Two camps emerged with different views on where to
   store CA and cross-certificates. In the CA's directory entry, one
   camp wanted self-issued PKCs stored in the cACertificate attribute,
   PKCs issued to this CA stored in the forward element of the
   crossCertificatePair, and PKCs issued from this CA for other CAs in
   the reverse element of the crossCertificatePair attribute. The other
   camp wanted all CA PKCs stored in the cACertificate attribute, and
   PKCs issued to and from another domain stored in the
   crossCertificatePair attribute. There was a short discussion that the
   second was more efficient than first, and that one solution or the
   other was more widely deployed. The end result was to indicate that
   self-issued PKCs and PKCs issued to the CA by CAs in the same domain
   as the CA are stored in the cACertificate attribute. The
   crossCertificatePair attribute's forward element will include all but
   self-issued PKCs issued to the CA. The reverse element may include a
   subset of PKCs issued by the CA to other CAs. With this resolution
   both camp's implementations are supported and are free to chose the
   location of CA PKCs to best support their implementation.

5.1.4 Name Constraints

   A question that has arisen a number of times is "how does one enforce
   Name constraints when there is more than one name form in a PKC?"
   That is, [FORMAT] states that:

     Subject's alternative names may be constrained in the same manner
     as subject distinguished names using the name constraints extension



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 36]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


     as described in section 4.2.1.11.

   What does this mean? Suppose that there is a CA with DN "O=IETF,
   OU=PKIX, CN=PKIX_CA", with the subjectAltName extension having
   dNSName "PKIX_CA.IETF.ORG". Suppose that that CA has issued a PKC
   with an empty DN, with subjectAltName extension having dNSName set to
   "PKIX_CA.IETF.ORG", and rfc822Name set to Steve@PKIX_CA.IETF.ORG. The
   question is, are name constraints enforced on these two PKCs - is the
   name of the EE PKC considered to be properly subordinate to the name
   of the CA?

   The answer is "yes". The general rules for deciding whether a PKC
   meets name constraints are:


     - If a PKC complies with name constraints in any one of its name
       forms, then the PKC is deemed to comply with name constraints.

     - If a PKC contains a name form that its issuer does not, the PKC
       is deemed to comply with name constraints for that name form.


   In deciding whether a name form meets name constraints, the following
   rules apply (in all cases Name B is the name in the name constraints
   extension):

5.1.4.1 rfc822Names

   Three variations are allowed:

     - If the name constraint is specified as "larry@mail.mit.edu", then
       Name A is subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree) if Name A
       contains all of Name B's name (specifies a particular mailbox).
       For example, larry@mail.mit.edu is subordinate, but
       larry_sanders@mail.mit.edu is not.

     - If the name constraint is specified as "mail.mit.edu", then Name
       A is subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree) if Name A contains
       all of Name B's name (specified all mailboxes on host
       mail.mit.edu). For example, curly@mail.mit.edu and
       mo@mail.mit.edu are subordinate, but mo@mail6.mit.edu and
       curly@smtp.mail.mit.edu are not.

     - If the name constraint is specified as ".mit.edu", then Name A is
       subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree) if Name A contains all of
       Name B's name, with the addition of zero or more additional host
       or domain names to the left of Name B's name. That is,
       smtp.mit.edu is subordinate to .mit.edu, as is pop.mit.edu.



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 37]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


       However, mit.edu is not subordinate to .mit.edu. When the
       constraint begins with a "." it specifies any address within a
       domain. In the previous example, "mit.edu" is not in the domain
       of ".mit.edu".

   Note: If rfc822 names are constrained, but the PKC does not contain a
   subjectAltName extension, the EmailAddress attribute will be used to
   constrain the name in the subject distinguished name. For example (c
   is country, o is organization, ou is organizational unit, and em is
   EmailAddress), Name A ("c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS, em=curly@mail.mit.edu")
   is subordinate to Name B ("c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS") (in B's subtree) if
   Name A contains all of Name B's names.

5.1.4.2 dNSNames

   Name A is subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree) if Name A contains
   all of Name B's name, with the addition of zero or more additional
   domain names to the left of Name B's name. That is, www.mit.edu is
   subordinate to mit.edu, as is larry.cs.mit.edu. However, www.mit.edu
   is not subordinate to web.mit.edu.

5.1.4.3 x.400 addresses

   Name A is subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree) if Name A contains
   all of Name B's name. For example (c is country-name, admd is
   administrative-domain-name, and o is organization-name, ou is
   organizational-unit-name, pn is personal-name, sn=surname, and gn is
   given-name in both Name A and B), the mnemonic X.400 address (using
   PrintableString choices for c and admd) "c=US, admd=AT&T, o=MIT,
   ou=cs, pn='sn=Doe,gn=John'" is subordinate to "c=US, admd=AT&T,
   o=MIT, ou=cs" and "c=US, admd=AT&T, o=MIT, pn='sn=DOE,gn=JOHN'" (pn
   is a SET that includes, among other things, sn and gn).

5.1.4.5 DNs

   Name A is subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree), if Name A contains
   all of Name B's name, treating attribute values encoded in different
   types as different strings, ignoring case in PrintableString (in all
   other types case is not ignored), removing leading and trailing white
   space in PrintableString, and converting internal substrings of one
   or more consecutive white space characters to a single space. For
   example, (c is country, o is organization, ou is organizational unit,
   and cn is common name):

     - Assuming PrintableString types for all attribute values in Name A
       and B, "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS" is subordinate to "c=us, o=MIT,
       ou=cs", as is "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS, ou=administration". Another
       example, "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS, cn= John Doe" (note the white



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 38]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


       spaces) is subordinate to "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS, cn=John Doe".

     - Assuming UTF8String types for all attribute values in Name A and
       B, "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS, ou=administration" is subordinate to
       "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS", but "c=US, o=MIT, ou=cs,
       ou=Administration". "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS, cn= John Smith" (note
       the white spaces) is not subordinate to "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS, cn=
       John Smith".

     - Assuming UTF8String types for all attribute values in Name A and
       PrintableString types for all attribute values in Name B, "c=US,
       o=MIT, ou=cs" is subordinate to "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS" if the
       verification software supports the full comparison algorithm in
       the X.500 series. "c=US, o=MIT, ou=cs" is NOT subordinate to
       "c=US, o=MIT, ou=CS" if the verification software supports the
       comparison algorithm in [FORMAT].

5.1.4.6 URIs

   The constraints apply only to the host part of the name. Two
   variations are allowed:

     - If the name constraint is specified as ".mit.edu", then Name A is
       subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree) if Name A contains all of
       Name B's name, with the addition of zero or more additional host
       or domain names to the left of Name B's name. That is,
       www.mit.edu is subordinate to .mit.edu, as is curly.cs.mit.edu.
       However, mit.edu is not subordinate to .mit.edu. When the
       constraint begins with a "." it specifies a host.

     - If the name constraint is specified as "abc.mit.edu", then Name A
       is subordinate to Name B (in B's subtree) if Name A contains all
       of Name B's name. No leftward expansion of the host or domain
       name is allowed.

5.1.4.7 iPaddresses

   Two variations are allowed depending on the IP version:

     - For IPv4 addresses: Name A (128.32.1.1 encoded as 80 20 01 01) is
       subordinate to Name B (128.32.1.0/255.255.255.0 encoded as 80 20
       00 00 FF FF FF 00) (in B's subtree) if Name A falls within the
       net denoted in Name B's CIDR notation.

     - For IPv6 addresses: Name A (4224.0.0.0.8.2048.8204.16762 encoded
       as 10 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 08 00 20 0C 41 7A) is
       subordinate to Name B (4224.0.0.0.8.2048.8204.0/
       65535.65535.65535.65535.65535.65535.65535.0 encoded as 10 80 00



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 39]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


       00 00 00 00 00 00 08 08 00 20 0C 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
       FF FF FF FF FF 00 00) (in B's subtree) if Name A falls within the
       net denoted in Name B's CIDR notation.

5.1.4.8 Others

   As [FORMAT] does not define requirements for the name forms
   otherName, ediPartyName, or registeredID there are no corresponding
   name constraints requirements.

5.1.5 Wildcards in Name Forms

   A "wildcard" in a name form is a placeholder for a set of names
   (e.g., "*.mit.edu" meaning "any domain name ending in .mit.edu", and
   *@aol.com meaning "email address that uses aol.com"). There are many
   people who believe that allowing wildcards in name forms in PKIX PKCs
   would be a useful thing to do, because it would allow a single PKC to
   be used by all members of a group. These members would presumably
   have attributes in common; e.g., access rights to some set of
   resources, and so issuance of a PKC with a wildcard for the group
   would simplify management.

   After much discussion, the PKIX working group decided to permit the
   use of wildcards in PKCs. That is, it is permissible for a PKIX-
   conformant CA to issue a PKC with a wildcard. However, the semantics
   of subjectAltName extension that include wildcard characters are not
   addressed by PKIX. Applications with specific requirements may use
   such names but must define the semantics.

5.1.6 Name Encoding

   A very important topic that consumed much of the WG's time was the
   implementation of the directory string choices. While the long term
   goal of the IETF was clear, use UTF8String, the short term goals were
   not so clear. Many implementations only use PrintableString, others
   use BMPString, and still others use Latin1String (ISO 8859-1) and tag
   it as TeletexString (there are others still). To ensure that there is
   consistency with encodings [FORMAT] defines a set of rules for the
   string choices. PrintableString was kept as the first choice because
   of it's widespread support by vendors. BMPString was the second
   choice, also for it's widespread vendor support. Failing support by
   PrintableString and BMPString, UTF8String must be used. In keeping
   with the IETF mandate, UTF8String can be used at any time if the CA
   supports it. Also, processing implementations that wish to support
   TeletexString should handle the entire ISO 8859-1 character set and
   not just the Latin1String subset.

5.1.7 Uniqueness

INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   [Add text in here about the QC uniqueness issues.]

5.2 POP

   Proof of Possession, or POP, or also CA POP, means that the CA is
   adequately convinced that the entity requesting a PKC containing a
   public key Y has access to the private key X corresponding to that
   public key.

   There has been some debate whether POP was or not needed.

   This question needs to be addressed separately considering the
   context of use of the key, in particular whether a key is used for an
   authentication or non repudiation service, or in a confidentiality
   service. Note that this does not map to the key usage bit directly,
   since it is possible to use a confidentiality key to perform an
   authentication service, e.g. by asking to decrypt an encrypted
   challenge.

5.2.1 POP for Signing Keys

   It is important to provide POP for keys used to sign material, in
   order to provide non-repudiation of transactions. For example,
   suppose Alice legitimately has private key X and its corresponding
   public key Y. Alice has a PKC from Charlie, a CA, containing Y. Alice
   uses X to sign a transaction T. Without POP, Mal could also get a PKC
   from Charlie containing the same public key, Y. Now without POP,
   there are two possible threats: Mal could claim to have been the real
   signer of T; or Alice can falsely deny signing T, claiming that it
   was instead Mal. Since no one can reliably prove that Mal did or did
   not ever possess X, neither of these claims can be refuted, and thus
   the service provided by and the confidence in the PKI has been
   defeated. (Of course, if Mal really did possess X, Alice's private
   key, then no POP mechanism in the world will help, but that is a
   different problem.)

   Protection can be gained by having Alice, as the true signer of the
   transaction, include in the signed information her PKC or an
   identifier of her PKC (e.g., a hash of her PKC). This makes
   impossible for Mal to claim authorship because he does not know the
   private key from Alice and thus is unable to include his certificate
   under the signature.

   The adequate protection may be obtained in the general case, by
   mandating the inclusion of a reference of the certificate every time
   a signature (or non repudiation) key is being used in a protocol.

   However, because all the protocols were not doing so, a conservative



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 41]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   measure has been taken by requesting POP to be performed by CAs. It
   should thus be understood, that this measure is not strictly
   necessary and is only a temporary measure to make old protocols
   secure. New protocols or data formats are being developed. If the key
   being used is always used in a context where the identifier of the
   certificate is included in the protocol, then POP by the CA is not
   necessary. The inclusion of the identifier of the certificate in the
   protocol or data format may be understood as POP being performed at
   the transaction time rather than by the CA, at the registration time
   of the user in the PKI.

5.2.2 POP for Key Management Keys

   Suppose that Al is a new instructor in the Computer Science
   Department of a local University. Al has created a draft final exam
   for the Introduction to Networking course he is teaching. He wants to
   send a copy of the draft final to Dorothy, the Department Head, for
   her review prior to giving the exam. This exam will of course be
   encrypted, as several students have access to the computer system.
   However, a quick search of the PKC repository (e.g., search the
   repository for all records with subjectPublicKey=Dorothy's-value)
   turns up the fact that several students have PKCs containing the same
   public key management key as Dorothy. At this point, if no POP has
   been done by the CA, Al has no way of knowing whether all of the
   students have simply created these PKCs without knowing the
   corresponding private key (and thus it is safe to send the encrypted
   exam to Dorothy), or whether the students have somehow acquired
   Dorothy's private key (and thus it is certainly not safe to send the
   exam).

   The later case may seem unsafe. However, if the other students have
   acquired the key, they do not even need to publish their certificates
   and can simply decrypt in parallel.

   The end story is that, if the key only known to Dorothy, there is no
   problem. Thus POP by the CA is not needed.

   If the key, like a Diffie-Hellman key, is used for an authentication
   service the answer depends from the protocol being used. In the
   former example, the decryption was done locally and no data was sent
   back on the wire. In an authentication protocol, the story is
   different because either some encrypted or decrypted data is sent
   back. If the data sent back contains the identifier of the
   certificate in a way that it cannot be modified without that
   modification being detected, then there is no need for POP. On the
   contrary, POP by the CA is needed.

   As a conservative measure, POP for encryption keys is recommended,



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 42]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   but it should be realized that it is not always needed.

   In general it should be noticed that POP at the time of the
   transaction is much superior than POP made by the CA, since it is
   possible in real time to be sure that everything is correct, rather
   than rely on that verification to be done at the time of registration
   by the CA. Should the CA fail in that verification, then there is a
   security breach. On the contrary, doing POP at the time of the
   transaction, eliminates that problem.

   CMP requires that POP be provided for all keys, either through on-
   line or out-of-band means. There are any number of ways to provide
   POP, and the choice of which to use is a local matter. Additionally,
   a PKC requester can provide POP to either a CA or to an RA, if the RA
   can adequately assure the CA that POP has been performed. Some of the
   acceptable ways to provide POP include:

     - Out-of-band means:

       - For keys generated by the CA or an RA (e.g., on a token such as
         a smart card or PCMCIA card), possession of the token can
         provide adequate proof of possession of the private key.

       - For user-generated keys, another approach can be used in
         environments where "key recovery" requirements force the
         requester to provide a copy of the private key to the CA or an
         RA. In this case, the CA will not issue the requested PKC until
         such time as the requester has provided the private key. This
         approach is in general not recommended, as it is extremely
         risky (e.g., the system designers need to figure out a way to
         protect the private keys from compromise while they are being
         sent to the CA/RA/other authority, and how to protect them
         there), but it can be used.

     - On-line means:

       - For signature keys that are generated by an EE, the requester
         of a PKC can be required to sign some piece of data (typically,
         the PKC request itself) using the private key. The CA will then
         use the requested public key to verify the signature. If the
         signature verification works, the CA can safely conclude that
         the requester had access to the private key. If the signature
         verification process fails, the CA can conclude that the
         requester did not have access to the correct private key, and
         reject the request.

       - For key management keys that are generated by the requester,
         the CA can send the user the requested public key, along with



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 43]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


         the CA's own public key, to encrypt some piece of data, and
         send it to the requester to be decrypted. For example, the CA
         can generate some random challenge, and require some action to
         be taken after decryption (e.g., "decrypt this encrypted random
         number and send it back to me"). If the requester does not take
         the requested action, the CA concludes that the requester did
         not possess the private key, and the PKC is not issued.

   Another method of providing POP for key management keys is for the CA
   to generate the requested PKC, and then send it to the requester in
   encrypted form. If the requester does not have access to the
   appropriate private key, the requester cannot decrypt the PKC, and
   thus cannot use it. After some period of time in which the PKC is not
   used, the CA will revoke the PKC. (This only works if the PKC is not
   made available to any untrusted entities until after the requester
   has successfully decrypted it.)

5.3 Key Usage Bits

   The key usage extension defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment,
   signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the PKC. This
   extension is used when a key that could be used for more than one
   operation is to be restricted. For example, if a CA's RSA key should
   be used only for signing CRLS, the cRLSign bit would be asserted.
   Likewise, when an RSA key should be used only for key management, the
   keyEncipherment bit would be asserted. When used, this extension
   should be marked critical.

   [FORMAT] includes some text for how the bits in the KeyUsage type are
   used. Developing the text for some of the bits was easy; however,
   many discussions were needed to arrive at a common agreement on the
   meaning of the digitalSignature (DS bit) and nonRepudiation (NR bit)
   bits and when they should be set. The group quickly realized that key
   usage extension mixes services and mechanisms. The DS bit indicates a
   mechanism - a public key used to verify a digital signature. The NR
   bit indicates a service - a public key used to verify a digital
   signature and to provide a non-repudiation service. When trying to
   indicate when each bit should be indicated arguments were based on:

     - The lifetime of the object being singed.  Some felt that the DS
       bit should be set when the certificate is used to sign ephemeral
       objects (e.g., bind tokens) while the NR bit should be set for
       things that are survive longer (e.g., documents). Of course, the
       problem with this distinction to determine how long is the time
       period for ephemeral?

     - A concious act taken by the signer. Many felt that the NR bit
       should be set only when the subject has expressly acknowledged



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 44]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


       that they want to use the private key to sign an object. Signing
       a document say where there is a concious decision by the subject
       would be appropriate for the key usage extension to contain NR,
       but when the key is used for authentication purposes, which can
       occur automically and more frequently, the DS bit is more
       appropriate. The discussion also concluded that since some
       authentication schemes occur automatically, that the DS bit and
       NR bit should never be set together in the same certificate. Some
       agreed to the differentiation of the bits based on the time, but
       did not agree that the two could not be in the same key usage
       extension.

     - The procedures followed by the CA. Some felt that NR bit was kind
       of 'quality mark' indicating to the verifier that the verifier
       could be assured that the CA is implementing appropriate
       procedures for checking the subject's identity, performing
       certificate archival, etc. Other felt that it was not entirely
       the CAs job and that some other entity must be involved.

   In the end the WG agreed to a few things:

     - Provision of the service of non-repudiation requires more than a
       single bit set in a PKC. It requires an entire infrastructure of
       components to preserve for some period of time the keys, PKCs,
       revocation status, signed material, etc., as well as a trusted
       source of time. However, the nonRepudiation key usage bit is
       provided as an indicator that such keys could be used as a
       component of a system providing a non-repudiation service.

     - The certificate policy is the appropriate place to indicate the
       permitted combinations of key usages. That is, a policy may
       indicate that the DS and NR bits can not be set in the same
       certificate while another may say that the DS and NR bits can be
       set in the same certificate.

   [2459bis] includes new text indicating the above agreements.

   5.4 Non-Repudiation

   The major benefit of the whole DS bit vs NR bit discussion is
   development of the Technical Requirements for Non-Repudiation
   [TECHNR] draft. To fill this void [TECHNR] was developed to "describe
   those features of a service which processes signed documents which
   must be present in order for that service to constitute a 'technical
   non-repudiation' service." The basic understanding of nonon-
   repudiation is that it requires that a digital signature be preserved
   in such a manner that it can convince a neutral third party that it
   was actually created by someone with access to the private key of a



Arsenault & Turner                                             [Page 45]





INTERNET DRAFT                PKIX Roadmap               22 October 1999


   certified key pair. Whether this definition of non-repudiation is
   enough to form a legally bind agreement is still being debated.

   [Add text to describe the different modes.]

5.5 Trust Models

   An important design decision is where in the PKI the trust point for
   a particular EE should be located (i.e., where is the EE's Root CA) .
   There are two extremes: the Top CA or the CA who issues the EE's
   certificate. Of course, the trust point for a particular EE can be
   anywhere in the PKI, but the following presents the advanatages and
   disadvantages of locating the the trust point at these two places.
