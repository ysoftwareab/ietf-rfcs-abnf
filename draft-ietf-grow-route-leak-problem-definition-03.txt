        Problem Definition and Classification of BGP Route Leaks
            draft-ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition-03

Abstract

   A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing
   system, known as 'route leaks', has received significant attention in
   recent years.  Frequent incidents that result in significant
   disruptions to Internet routing are labeled "route leaks", but to
   date we have lacked a common definition of the term.  In this
   document, we provide a working definition of route leaks, keeping in
   mind the real occurrences that have received significant attention.
   Further, we attempt to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different
   types of route leaks based on observed events on the Internet.  We
   aim to provide a taxonomy that covers several forms of route leaks
   that have been observed and are of concern to Internet user community
   as well as the network operator community.

1.  Introduction

   Frequent incidents [Huston2012][Cowie2013][Toonk2015-A][Toonk2015-B][
   Cowie2010][Madory][Zmijewski][Paseka][LRL][Khare] that result in
   significant disruptions to Internet routing are commonly called
   "route leaks".  Examination of the details of some of these incidents
   reveals that they vary in their form and technical details.  Before
   we can discuss solutions to "the route leak problem" we need a clear,
   technical definition of the problem and its most common forms.  In
   Section 2, we provide a working definition of route leaks, keeping in
   view many recent incidents that have received significant attention.

   Further, in Section 3, we attempt to enumerate (though not
   exhaustively) different types of route leaks based on observed events
   on the Internet.  We aim to provide a taxonomy that covers several
   forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of concern to
   Internet user community as well as the network operator community.
   This document builds on and extends earlier work in the IETF by
   Dickson [draft-dickson-sidr-route-leak-def][draft-dickson-sidr-route-
   leak-reqts].

2.  Working Definition of Route Leaks

   A proposed working definition of route leak is as follows:

   A "route leak" is the propagation of routing announcement(s) beyond
   their intended scope.  That is, an AS's announcement of a learned BGP
   route to another AS is in violation of the intended policies of the
   receiver, the sender and/or one of the ASes along the preceding AS
   path.  The intended scope is usually defined by a set of local
   redistribution/filtering policies distributed among the ASes
   involved.  Often, these intended policies are defined in terms of the
   pair-wise peering business relationship between ASes (e.g., customer,
   transit provider, peer).  For literature related to AS relationships
   and routing policies, see [Gao] [Luckie] [Gill].  For measurements of
   valley-free violations in Internet routing, see [Anwar] [Giotsas]
   [Wijchers].

   The result of a route leak can be redirection of traffic through an
   unintended path which may enable eavesdropping or traffic analysis,
   and may or may not result in an overload or black-hole.  Route leaks
   can be accidental or malicious, but most often arise from accidental
   misconfigurations.

   The above definition is not intended to be all encompassing.
   Perceptions vary widely about what constitutes a route leak.  Our aim
   here is to have a working definition that fits enough observed
   incidents so that the IETF community has a basis for developing
   solutions for route leak detection and mitigation.

3.  Classification of Route Leaks Based on Documented Events

   As illustrated in Figure 1, a common form of route leak occurs when a
   multi-homed customer AS (such as AS3 in Figure 1) learns a prefix
   update from one transit provider (ISP1) and leaks the update to
   another transit provider (ISP2) in violation of intended routing
   policies, and further the second transit provider does not detect the
   leak and propagates the leaked update to its customers, peers, and
   transit ISPs.

        Figure 1: Illustration of the basic notion of a route leak.

   We propose the following taxonomy for classification of route leaks
   aiming to cover several types of recently observed route leaks, while
   acknowledging that the list is not meant to be exhaustive.  In what
   follows, we refer to the AS that announces a route that is in
   violation of the intended policies as the "offending AS".

3.1.  Type 1: U-Shaped Turn with Full Prefix

   Description: A multi-homed AS learns a route from one upstream ISP
   and simply propagates it to another upstream ISP.  Neither the prefix
   nor the AS path in the update is altered.  This is similar to a
   straight forward path-poisoning attack [Kapela-Pilosov], but with
   full prefix.  It should be noted that leaks of this type are often
   accidental (i.e. not malicious).  The update basically makes a
   U-shaped turn at the offending AS's multi-homed AS.  The leak often
   succeeds because the second ISP prefers customer announcement over
   peer announcement of the same prefix.  Data packets would reach the
   legitimate destination albeit via the offending AS, unless they are
   dropped at the offending AS due to its inability to handle resulting
   large volumes of traffic.

   o  Example incidents: Examples of Type 1 route-leak incidents are (1)
      the Dodo-Telstra incident in March 2012 [Huston2012], (2) the
      Moratel-PCCW route leak of Google prefixes in November 2012
      [Paseka], (3) the VolumeDrive-Atrato incident in September 2014
      [Madory], (4) the Hathway-Airtel route leak of 336 Google prefixes
      causing widespread interruption of Google services in Europe and
      Asia [Toonk2015-A], and (5) the massive Telekom Malaysia route-

Internet-Draft        Route Leak Problem Definition         October 2015


      leaks of about 179,000 prefixes, which in turn Level3 accepted and
      propagated [Toonk2015-B].

3.2.  Type 2: Lateral ISP-ISP-ISP Leak

   Description: The term "lateral" here is synonymous with "non-transit"
   or "peer-to-peer".  This type of route leak typically occurs when,
   for example, three sequential ISP peers (e.g.  ISP-A, ISP-B, and ISP-
   C) are involved, and ISP-B receives a route from ISP-A and in turn
   leaks it to ISP-C.  The typical routing policy between laterally
   (i.e. non-transit) peering ISPs is that they should only propagate to
   each other their respective customer prefixes.

   o  Example incidents: In [Mauch-nanog][Mauch], route leaks of this
      type are reported by monitoring updates in the global BGP system
      and finding three or more very large ISP ASNs in a sequence in a
      BGP update's AS path.  Mauch [Mauch] observes that these are
      anomalies and potentially route leaks because very large ISPs such
      as ATT, Sprint, Verizon, and Globalcrossing do not in general buy
      transit services from each other.  However, he also notes that
      there are exceptions when one very large ISP does indeed buy
      transit from another very large ISP, and accordingly exceptions
      are made in his detection algorithm for known cases.

3.3.  Type 3: Leak of Transit-Provider Prefixes to Peer

   Description: This type of route leak occurs when an offending AS
   leaks routes learned from its transit provider to a lateral (i.e.
   non-transit) peer.

   o  Example incidents: The incidents reported in [Mauch] include the
      Type 3 leaks.

3.4.  Type 4: Leak of Peer Prefixes to Transit Provider

   Description: This type of route leak occurs when an offending AS
   leaks routes learned from a lateral (i.e. non-transit) peer to its
   (the AS's) own transit provider.  These leaked routes typically
   originate from the customer cone of the lateral peer.

   o  Example incidents: Some of the example incidents cited for Type 1
      route leaks above are also inclusive of Type 4 route leaks.  For
      instance, in the Dodo-Telstra incident [Huston2012], the leaked
      routes from Dodo to Telstra included routes that Dodo learned from
      its transit providers as well as lateral peers.

Internet-Draft        Route Leak Problem Definition         October 2015


3.5.  Type 5: U-Shaped Turn with More Specific Prefix

   Description: A multi-homed AS learns a route from one upstream ISP
   and announces a subprefix (subsumed in the prefix) to another
   upstream ISP.  The AS path in the update is not altered.  Update is
   crafted by the offending AS to have a subprefix to maximize the
   success of the attack while reverse path is kept open by the path
   poisoning techniques as in [Kapela-Pilosov].  Data packets reach the
   legitimate destination albeit via the offending AS.

   o  Example incidents: One example is the demo performed at DEFCON-16
      in August 2008 [Kapela-Pilosov].  Another example is the earlier-
      mentioned incident of route leaks from Telekom Malaysia via
      Level3, in which out of about 179,000 total route-leaked prefixes,
      about 10,000 were more specifics of previously announced less
      specific prefixes [Toonk2015-B].  [Note: An attacker who
      deliberately performs a Type 1 route leak (with full prefix) can
      just as easily perform a Type 5 route leak (with subprefix) to
      achieve a greater impact.]

3.6.  Type 6: Prefix Re-Origination with Data Path to Legitimate Origin

   Description: A multi-homed AS learns a route from one upstream ISP
   and announces the prefix to another upstream ISP as if it is being
   originated by it (i.e. strips the received AS path, and re-originates
   the prefix).  This can be called re-origination or mis-origination.
   However, somehow (not attributable to the use of path poisoning trick
   by the offending AS) a reverse path is present, and data packets
   reach the legitimate destination albeit via the offending AS.  But
   sometimes the reverse path may not be there, and data packets get
   dropped following receipt by the offending AS.

   o  Example incidents: Examples of Type 6 route leak include (1) the
      China Telecom incident in April 2010 [Hiran][Cowie2010][Labovitz],
      (2) the Belarusian GlobalOneBel route leak incidents in February-
      March 2013 and May 2013 [Cowie2013], (3) the Icelandic Opin Kerfi-
      Simmin route leak incidents in July-August 2013 [Cowie2013], and
      (4) the Indosat route leak incident in April 2014 [Zmijewski].

3.7.  Type 7: Accidental Leak of Internal Prefixes and More Specifics

   Description: An offending AS simply leaks its internal prefixes to
   one or more of its transit-provider ASes and/or ISP peers.  The
   leaked internal prefixes are often more specifics subsumed by an
   already announced less specific prefix.  The more specifics were not
   intended to be routed in eBGP.  Further, the AS receiving those leaks
   fails to filter them.  Typically these leaked announcements are due
   to some transient failures within the AS; they are short-lived, and



Sriram, et al.           Expires April 14, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Route Leak Problem Definition         October 2015


   typically withdrawn quickly following the announcements.  However,
   these more specifics may momentarily cause the routes to be preferred
   over other aggregate route announcements, thus redirecting traffic
   from its normal best path.

   o  Example incidents: Leaks of internal routes occur frequently (e.g.
      multiple times in a week), and the number of prefixes leaked range
      from hundreds to thousands per incident.  One highly conspicuous
      and widely disruptive leak of internal routes happened recently in
      August 2014 when AS701 and AS705 leaked about 22,000 more
      specifics of already announced aggregates [Huston2014][Toonk2014].

4.  Additional Comments about the Classification

   It is worth noting that Types 1 through 4 are similar in that a route
   is leaked in violation of policy in each case, but what varies is the
   context of the leaked-route source AS and destination AS roles.

   It is also worth noting that Type 5 route leak involves a subprefix
   and is a special case of Type 1, which involves a full prefix.
   Similarly, subprefix versions of other types of route leaks may also
   be considered, for example, for Types 2, 3, and 4.  Similarly, Type 6
   (i.e. prefix mis-origination with data path to legitimate origin) can
   be also conceived to happen in conjunction with Types 2, 3, and 4.
   While these possibilities are acknowledged, simply enumerating more
   types to consider all such special cases does not add value as far as
   solution development for route leaks is concerned.  Hence, the
   special cases mentioned here are not included in enumerating route
   leak types.

5.  Summary

   We attempted to provide a working definition of route leak.  We also
   presented a taxonomy for categorizing route leaks.  It covers not all
   but at least several forms of route leaks that have been observed and
   are of concern to Internet user and network operator communities.  We
   hope that this work provides the IETF community a basis for pursuing
   possible BGP enhancements for route leak detection and mitigation.

6.  Security Considerations

   No security considerations apply since this is a problem definition
   document.
