Abstract 
    
   This document describes an extensible mechanism that allows a BGP   
   speaker to advertise multiple BGP paths for a destination to its   
   peers, by describing a new BGP capability, termed "Multiple-Hop   
   Capability".   
        
   The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to all 
   routers, both those with the ability to inject multiple routing 
   entries in their forwarding table and those without.

1. Introduction 
    
   Currently BGP [BGP4] speakers cannot announce multiple paths, even if 
   it is desirable in certain scenarios.  This is because the BGP 
   specification allows only one "best" route to be inserted into the   
   Loc-RIB, and to be announced to other BGP speakers.  If another route   
   for a destination that has previously been announced to a BGP peer, 
   is sent later, then the receiver “implicitly withdraws” the former 
   route and replaces it with the new one. 
     
   Because of this behavior, BGP speakers are never able to advertise   
   multiple paths for the same destination to their peers. 
    
   Lifting this restriction would have benefit for at least the   
   following scenarios in BGP:

   o Persistent route-oscillation conditions in BGP [MED] 
    
   o eBGP mesh scaling at Internet Exchanges 
    
   o Interaction between ECMP capable BGP speakers 
    
   The first concerns route-reflectors [RR], where in certain 
   topologies, persistent route-oscillation conditions can arise due to 
   the clients of route-reflectors being never fully informed of each 
   others best paths, particularly where MED/Router ID values are 
   considered as part of the best-path selection.  If BGP were to 
   provide a means to allow route-reflectors to share all the collective 
   best-paths with its clients, then these conditions could be 
   alleviated, as has been shown in the Appendix. 
    
   The second concerns scaling of eBGP meshes at Internet Exchanges 
   (referred to as an IX from now on, or IXes in the plural).  IX   
   operators have deployed eBGP route-servers, in a variety of guises,   
   in order to reduce the need for customers to establish direct   
   sessions with other customers.  These route-servers however have   
   severe limitations because of the single-path restriction in BGP. 
   Removing this limitation would allow for efficient deployment of IX   
   route-servers. 
    
   The third concerns BGP implementations which are capable of 
   considering multiple routes for inclusion into their RIB, and hence 
   likely their FIB, but do not have a way to relay the full resulting   
   state of their BGP RIB to their peers. 
    
   This document specifies the mechanism by which Multiple-Hop operates; 
   however it will not attempt to fully describe the usages.  In 
   particular this document anticipates that the ECMP scenario will be 
   described fully in another document, as it would have to be even if 
   documented without consideration of the Multiple-Hop capability.   
    
   It is anticipated however that any speaker implementing the 
   functionality described in this document would be able to 
   interoperate with Multiple-Hop capable route-servers and route-
   reflectors, just as BGP speakers interoperate with Route-Reflectors 
   in the absence of the Multiple-Hop capability. 
    
2. Multiple-Hop Capability 
    
   Multiple Hop capability is a new capability that can be used by a BGP 
   speaker to indicate its ability to understand Multiple-Hop Updates 
   from a remote peer. 
    
   This capability is defined as follows:

       Capability Code: TBD 
    
       Capability Length: Variable 
    
       Capability Values: Consists of one or more of the tuples <AFI,  
       SAFI, Flags for the address family> as follows: 
    
             +--------------------------------------------------+ 
             |  Address Family Identifier (16 bits)             | 
             +--------------------------------------------------+ 
             |  Subsequent Address Family Identifier (8 bits)   | 
             +--------------------------------------------------+ 
             |  Flags for the Address Family (8 bits)           | 
             +--------------------------------------------------+ 
    
                                 Figure 1 
    
   The use and meaning of the fields are as follows: 
    
   Address Family Identifier 
    
       This field carries the identity of the Network Layer protocol 
       for which the Multiple Hop support is advertised. Presently 
       defined values for this field are specified in [IANA-AFI]. 
    
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI): 
    
       This field provides additional information about the type of 
       the Network Layer Reachability Information carried in the  
       attribute. Presently defined values for this field are specified  
       in [IANA-SAFI]. 
    
   Flags for Address Family: 
    
       This field contains bit flags for the <AFI, SAFI>.

       BGP paths, other than just the best path from the receiver. 
    
       A speaker sets this bit in its MULTIPLE_NEXT_HOP capability to  
       indicate that it is prepared to receive additional path 
       advertisements, beyond just the best path, by way of the 
       MULTIPLE_NEXT_HOP capability. 
    
       As such, speakers implementing the MULTIPLE_NEXT_HOP capability 
       MUST not send additional paths, beyond the single best path  
       allowed by BGP-4 [BGP4], unless the remote speaker has  
       indicated its preparedness with the RM bit. 
       
2.1 Multiple-Hop attribute - MULTIPLE_HOP 
    
   This attribute is an optional, non-transitive attribute that can be 
   used for advertising multiple next-hops associated with a NLRI. 
    
   The attribute data contains one or more tuples of (AFI,SAFI, List   
   of Next Hop Information), where each tuple is encoded as shown   
   below: 
    
    
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |      Address Family Identifier (2 octets)      | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (1 octet) | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |          Number of Next Hops (1 octet)         | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |     Length of the First Next Hop (1 octet)     | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |  Network Address of First Next Hop (variable)  | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |     Length of the Second Next Hop (1 octet)    | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |  Network Address of Second Next Hop (variable) | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |                      . . .                     | 
               |                      . . .                     | 
               +------------------------------------------------+ 
               |      Length of the Nth Next Hop (1 octet)      |

   Address Family Identifier: The AFI field carries the identity of      
   the Network Layer protocol associated with the Network Address      
   that follows. 
    
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier: The SAFI field in      
   combination with the Address Family Identifier field identifies      
   the Network Layer context associated with the Network Address of      
   the Next Hop(s). 
    
   Number of Next-Hops: This field carries the total number of Multiple-      
   Hop BGP routes for the given NLRI. 
    
   Length of Nth Next Hop Network Address: A 1 octet field whose value      
   expresses the length of the "Network Address of Next Hop" field as      
   measured in octets.  For IPv6 routes the value shall be set to 16,      
   when only a global address is present, or 32 if a link-local      
   address is also included in the Next Hop field [BGP-IPv6]. 
    
   Network Address of Nth Next Hop: This is a variable length field that      
   contains the Network Address of the next router on the path to the      
   destination. 
    
   The N next-hops listed in the MULTIPLE_HOP path attribute define the   
   Network Layer address of the routers that should be used as next-hops   
   to the destinations listed in the UPDATE message. 
    
3. Operation when both peers are Multiple-Hop capable 
 
   In the following sections, "Local speaker" refers to a router which 
   is advertising the BGP Multiple-Hop routes, and the "Receiving   
   Speaker" refers to a router that peers with the former to accept   
   multiple BGP routes for a destination. 
    
   Consider that the Multiple-Hop Capability has been exchanged between   
   the Local speaker and the Receiving speaker, and a BGP session   
   between them is established.  The following sections detail the   
   procedures that shall be followed by the Local speaker as well as the   
   Receiving speaker once the Multiple-Hop capability has been   
   exchanged, and the local speaker wants to advertise some BGP   
   Multiple-Hop routes. 
    
   Note that for operation within the confines of this document and BGP,   
   the local speaker almost certainly will be acting as an eBGP route-
   server or iBGP route-reflector, with the receiver asserting the RM 
   bit in the Multiple-Hop capability, and therefore acting as a client 
   of that speaker. 
    
   Other uses, such as ECMP speakers exchanging Multiple-Hop routes will   
   require further consideration, not addressed in this document as   
 
 
Bhatia, Halpern and Jakma                                      [Page 6] 
Internet Draft                                              August 2006 
 
 
   stated previously, considerations not per se related to the Multiple-   
   Hop capability itself. 
    
3.1 Advertisement of Multiple-Hop BGP routes 
 
   The extensions proposed in this draft allow BGP paths to be 
   identified by their NLRI and next-hop address, rather than just by 
   their NLRI.  This extended identification is indicated by the 
   presence of the MULTIPLE_HOP attribute. Given that this is used when 
   there are multiple paths sharing NLRI, this attribute allows for the 
   representation of multiple such paths in a single advertisement. 
    
   Thus between Multiple-Hop capable speakers, the MULTIPLE_HOP 
   attribute MUST be used in addition to the existing NEXT_HOP in order 
   to announce multiple next-hops for the destinations listed in the 
   NLRI field of the UPDATE message. 
       
   All prefixes announced using this attribute MUST NOT replace the   
   previous advertisements and thus, multiple BGP paths for a prefix can   
   be advertised by the Local Speaker. If the same prefix is later   
   announced with ONLY the NEXT_HOP attribute then it MUST be taken as   
   an implicit withdraw for all the previous paths advertised by that   
   peer for that destination. 
    
   It should be noted that transmission of multiple paths is only valid 
   for the same NLRI that differ on the next-hop.  
    
   An UPDATE message which contains feasible routes and carries   
   MULTIPLE_HOP and no NEXT_HOP attribute MUST NOT be considered as an   
   implicit withdrawal.  The Receiving Speaker MUST append these   
   routes in its Adj-RIBs-In [BGP4], as additional paths to that   
   destination. 
    
   When advertising multiple paths which do not have identical path 
   attributes, separate BGP UPDATE messages MUST be sent, each with a 
   MULTIPLE_HOP attribute even if there is only one next-hop in each 
   MULTIPLE_HOP attribute. Presence of MULTIPLE_HOP suppresses route 
   replacement at the receiving end. 
    
3.2 Withdrawal Procedures 
    
   An UPDATE message which contains an IP address prefix in the 
   WITHDRAWN ROUTES marks all the associated routes as being no longer 
   available for use. 
    
   An UPDATE message consisting of an IP address prefix in the NLRI 
   field and only the NEXT_HOP attribute implicitly withdraws all the 
   routes to that address prefix and replaces it with the one advertised 
   by the NEXT_HOP. 
 
 
Bhatia, Halpern and Jakma                                      [Page 7] 
Internet Draft                                              August 2006 
 
 
    
   An UPDATE message which contains an IP address prefix in the 
   WITHDRAWN ROUTES and the MULTIPLE_HOP attribute only removes the path 
   associated with that next-hop. 
    
   An UPDATE message announced with a MULTIPLE_HOP attribute for a given 
   IP address prefix implicitly withdraws any previous route announced 
   with the same next-hop.  
    
3.3 Procedures for the Receiving Speaker 
    
   The Receiving Speaker upon receiving the MULTIPLE_HOP attribute will   
   understand that the Local Speaker has advertised Multiple-Hop BGP   
   routes.  Within a single UPDATE message all the prefixes will have   
   identical attributes, except for the next-hops, which will be carried   
   in the MULTIPLE_HOP attribute. 
    
   A series of further UPDATE messages for the same NLRI, with or 
   without the same set of attributes and containing the MULTIPLE_HOP 
   attribute will be understood to be additive. Each UPDATE message 
   would append these additional feasible routes, to the appropriate 
   Adj-RIBs-In, where after the receiving speaker may run its normal 
   decision process to select the best path to install in its Local-RIB.  
    
   Upon receiving an UPDATE message for the same NLRI, without the 
   MULTIPLE_HOP attribute, the receiver will consider this as a 
   replacement route for all the previously announced routes to that 
   destination. 
    
   If the BGP Speaker wants to withdraw all the BGP routes for a 
   particular address prefix then it can send a normal BGP UPDATE 
   message listing the IP address prefix in the WITHDRAWN ROUTES field. 
   The Receiving Speaker upon receiving this message MUST remove all the 
   routes associated with that destination. 
    
   If the Receiving Speaker receives an UPDATE message with the   
   MULTIPLE_HOP attribute listing both, the feasible and the   
   unfeasible routes, then it MUST consider the path attributes for the   
   feasible routes.  All the destinations listed in the WITHDRAWN ROUTES 
   MUST be removed as per [BGP4]. 
    
3.4 Working with Multiple-Hop capable IBGP peers 
 
   This section explains how multiple-hop feature will work in the 
   normal scenarios. 
    
   Assume that the two IBGP speakers A and B exchange this capability.   
   Consider a case where A receives multiple UPDATE messages for NLRI X 
   with next-hops Nj, Nk and Nm. Assume that all these routes are valid 
 
 
Bhatia, Halpern and Jakma                                      [Page 8] 
Internet Draft                                              August 2006 
 
 
   and A wants to pass on this set to B. Also assume that Nj and Nk 
   share the same path attributes (Origin, AS Path, Local Pref, etc) and 
   can be thus advertised in a single UPDATE message. 
    
   A makes an UPDATE message and uses the MULTIPLE_HOP path attribute.   
   It puts the AFI, SAFI, number of next-hops as 2, length of the first 
   next-hop Nj, network address of Nj, length of Nk and the network 
   address of Nk. 
    
   When this UPDATE message reaches B, it looks at the MULTIPLE_HOP 
   attribute and understands that there are multiple routes to reach X. 
   It inserts the two routes for X with the next-hops Nj and Nk in its 
   Adj-RIBs-In.  
    
   A also needs to announce the remaining route to X with next-hop Nl.  
   It makes an UPDATE message, fills the path attributes, and uses the 
   MULTIPLE_HOP attribute to encode next-hop information about Nl. This 
   UPDATE message is sent to B. 
    
   When B receives this UPDATE message it knows that this is not a 
   replacement route for X as it comes with the MULTIPLE_HOP   
   attribute. It simply appends this new route in its adj-RIBs-In,   
   runs the decision process, and proceeds as normal. 
    
   Assume that at some point later, A needs to withdraw the route   
   associated with the tuple [X, nexthop Nk]. It makes an UPDATE 
   message, puts X in the WITHDRAWN ROUTES and inserts the MULTIPLE_HOP 
   attribute, encoding the next-hop Nk inside. 
    
   When B receives this UPDATE message it understands that A wants to 
   remove one (or more) of the routes associated with X. To determine 
   which exact route(s) needs to be removed, it looks at the 
   MULTIPLE_HOP attribute and goes about removing all the routes 
   associated with the next-hops listed therein. 
    
3.5 Implicit Withdrawal for one of the Next-Hops 
    
   In the same scenario to replace a route associated with the tuple [X, 
   next-hop Nk], A can advertise a fresh route with a new set of path 
   attributes. B would consider the new advertisement as an implicit 
   withdrawal for the previously announced route for the tuple [X, next-
   hop Nk]. 
    
4. Multiprotocol Extensions to BGP 
 
   Since the MULTIPLE_HOP includes both the AFI and SAFI, it is possible   
   to advertise multiple MPBGP routes.  In this case, MP_REACH_NLRI

   To suppress route replacement the additional routes must be 
   advertised by keeping the length of the next-hop as 0 in the 
   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute. The same should be encoded in the 
   MULTIPLE_HOP attribute. 
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues   
   inherent in the existing BGP.

9. Appendix A 
 
   This section explains some scenarios where advertising multiple BGP 
   paths may prove to be useful. 
 
9.1 Suboptimal Routing in Route Reflector clients 
    
   Route Reflection can result in suboptimal routing due to the client   
   not having full visibility to all the BGP paths in the AS.  This is   
   because the RR selects the best path and reflects only that best path   
   to its clients.  In case the RR has equal cost BGP routes, then it   
   shall select the one based on the lower Router ID.  As a result, the   
   clients do not receive the full view of the available paths, or at   
   least the paths that are equidistant from the RR.  This can result in   
   suboptimal routing from the client's perspective.  A client may have   
   selected a different best path if more paths had been made visible to   
   it.  With Multiple-hop BGP, the RR can advertise all the equal cost   
   BGP routes that it has to its client, giving the client more options   
   to choose from. 
    
   The extensions proposed in this draft provide provision for the RR to 
   reflect all the routes to its clients.

   Consider the topology as shown in Figure 1.  Say, AS X consists of 
   Route Reflector (RR) and two clients Ra and Rb.  Ra is connected to 
   R2 in AS Y and R1 in AS Z. Rb is connected to R3 in AS Z. Assume that 
   the Router ID of R1 < R2 and IGP cost c1 < c2.  The dashed lines 
   between the routers shows BGP peering.  Assume that the BGP speakers   
   in AS Y and AS Z receive a BGP UPDATE for 10.0.0.0/8 from AS W.   
   Assume that they advertise the following path attributes to BGP   
   speakers in AS X: 
    
   R2: NLRI 10.0.0.0/8, AS_PATH Y W, MED 100, NEXT_HOP R2

   R1: NLRI 10.0.0.0/8, AS_PATH Z W, MED 300, NEXT_HOP R1 
    
   R3: NLRI 10.0.0.0/8, AS_PATH Z W, MED 200, NEXT_HOP R3 
    
   Scenario 1: Traditional BGP in AS X 
    
   The following events happen: 
    
   1. Ra receives UPDATE messages from R2 and R1.  Since they are from 
      different ASes, MEDs are not compared and the tie breaks on the        
      lower Router ID.  Since R1 < R2, route from R1 is selected and         
      advertised to the RR.  Ra thus has the following path as the         
      best one for 10.0.0.0/8: 
    
      AS_PATH Z W, MED 300, NEXT_HOP R1 
    
   2. Rb receives the UPDATE from R3, installs this and advertises the 
      same to the RR.  Rb thus has the following path for 10.0.0.0/8: 
    
      AS_PATH Z W, MED 200, NEXT_HOP R3 
    
   3. RR receives two UPDATE messages from its clients. Since the  
      neighboring AS is the same in both of them, the tie breaks on the  
      route having the lower value of MED.  It thus selects the route it 
      learns from Rb as the best one and advertises this to Ra. 
    
   4. Ra now has all the three paths.  Route learnt from Rb wins over 
      the route learnt from R1 (lower MED) and the route learnt from 
      R2 wins over the route learnt from Rb (EBGP > IBGP). 
    
   5. Ra thus sends an implicit WITHDRAW to the RR, replacing the 
      earlier announcement with the route learnt from R2. 
    
   6. RR thus has the following paths for 10.0.0.0/8: 
    
      AS_PATH Y W, MED 100, NEXT_HOP R2 
      AS_PATH Z W, MED 200, NEXT_HOP R3 
    
    
      It selects the first path because the IGP cost to reach the 
      NEXT_HOP (R2) is lesser for the first one.  It thus, advertises  
      this path to Rb and sends a WITHDRAW message to Ra, removing the  
      path it had initially announced (one learnt from Rb) 
    
   7. Ra receives the WITHDRAW message from the RR and removes the path.   
      Nothing is done as it is currently not the best path. 
    
   8. Rb receives the advertisement from RR, but doesn't do anything, as  
      the path learnt from R3 is better (EBGP > IBGP).

   9. Ra at this time has only two routes.  One, learnt from R1 and the  
      other learnt from R2: 
    
      AS_PATH Z W, MED 300, NEXT_HOP R1 
    
      AS_PATH Y W, MED 100, NEXT_HOP R2 
    
      It has selected the route learnt from R2.  After some time, this 
      router runs its scanner process for validating the NEXT_HOPs. 
      There it runs the best path algorithm and finds that the route 
      learnt from R1 is better than the route learnt from R2, because 
      of the lower Router ID. 
    
   10.Ra sends an implicit WITHDRAW to RR, replacing the earlier  
      announcement with the route learnt from R2. 
    
   11... 
    
   The loop follows and it cycles again and again. 
    
   Scenario 2: Multiple-Hop BGP is implemented in AS X 
    
   1. If everything happens the same as in the preceding example then 
      Ra will have two paths to reach 10.0.0.0/8.  Since everything 
      else is the same, it will advertise both these routes to the RR. 
      Note that Ra will not look at the Router ID, etc. for tie 
      breaking if Multiple-Hop capabilities are implemented. 
    
   2. RR will now have three paths for 10.0.0.0/8.  Path 3, from Rb and 
      Paths 1 and 2 from Ra. 
    
      Path 1: AS_PATH Y W, MED 100, NEXT_HOP R2 
    
      Path 2: AS_PATH Z W, MED 300, NEXT_HOP R1 
    
      Path 3: AS_PATH Z W, MED 200, NEXT_HOP R3 
    
      Out of Path 2 and Path 3, it will select Path 3 (lower MED).From  
      Path 1 and Path 3, it will select Path 1, based on the lower 
      IGP cost. RR thus selects the Path 1 as the best route. 
    
   3. RR will advertise the new path to Rb. Rb will thus have the  
      following two paths: 
    
      Path 1: AS_PATH Y W, MED 100, NEXT_HOP R2 
       
      Path 2: AS_PATH Z W, MED 200, NEXT_HOP R3 
       
 
 
Bhatia, Halpern and Jakma                                      [Page 14] 
Internet Draft                                              August 2006 
 
 
      Path 2 will win because of the EBGP > IBGP rule, and it will 
      continue using R3. There is thus, no change on Rb and it 
      continues using the same path as before. 
       
   4. The network is stable and there are no route oscillations. 
    
9.3 eBGP mesh scaling at IXes via Route Servers 
    
   IXes today sometimes offer their customers the facility to peer with 
   a neutral IX route-server as a means to reduce the direct peering   
   requirements for their customers.  The peering overhead may be   
   considerable given the many hundreds of ASes which may be present at   
   some of the larger IXes today, and it is quite plausible that IXes   
   will continue to grow in terms of attached customers and ASes. 
    
   However, the single-path limitation of BGP imposes great operational   
   difficulty in allowing such a route-server to be effective. 
    
   There are typically two kinds of route-server, one which is a normal   
   BGP speaker and simply provides a single-best-path-for-all service,   
   and the type which are configured with each customer’s policies and   
   calculate the best-path separately for each.  Both approaches have 
   their limitations: 
    
   o  Route-servers which simply advertise the current best known IX  
      path according to normal BGP procedures, without applying any  
      customer-specific policy, require the customers to often still  
      establish direct sessions with each other for cases where they  
      wish to apply policy.  Much of the scaling benefits are never  
      realised. 
    
   o  Route-servers which apply policy on their customers behalf, 
      selecting the best-path on a per-customer basis and then 
      advertising each customer a tailor-made best-path, require 
      extensive co-ordination of policy between the IX operators and 
      each of their customers.  Further, it may be difficult for 
      customers to keep their policies private due the operational 
      requirements of policy co-ordination between IX and customer. 
    
   If there were a mechanism in BGP to allow an IX route-server to pass   
   all other advertisements to a customer peer, without performing any   
   path selection or applying any policy, then this would remove the   
   need for policy co-ordination between each customer and the IX, and   
   address the other shortcomings listed above.  Such a mechanism would   
   be easy for both the IX operator and each customer to deploy and   
   maintain. 
    
9.4 Advertising a subset of routes in BGP 
    
 
 
Bhatia, Halpern and Jakma                                      [Page 15] 
Internet Draft                                              August 2006 
 
 
   Providers can tag some selected routes with certain communities 
   [COMM]. An administrator could write a policy that would advertise 
   all the paths carrying a known community within that AS to another 
   router capable of understanding the Multiple-Hop extensions.  This is 
   a form of policy implementation and a detailed study of what could be 
   achieved using such techniques is beyond the scope of this draft. 
 
9.5 Equal Cost Multiple Path BGP 
 
   Currently some implementations, when they receive multiple equal cost   
   BGP routes from different peers, are able to insert all of them (or a   
   subset of those, based on their local policies) in their forwarding   
   table to locally split the load for the destination, while announcing   
   only one "best" BGP path to its other peers.  This however has   
   implications for those other peers which receive such an announcement   
   from this ECMP capable BGP speaker.  The implication, as per route   
   aggregation, is these other peers potentially will not posses the   
   full path information, which can lead to loops.  Hence, such an ECMP   
   capable BGP speaker can only enable this feature if great care is   
   taken, if at all, or must act as if it had aggregated the set of   
   routes concerned. 
    
   While this document does not directly address the question of ECMP,   
   the mechanism introduced can be built upon in order to do so.  It   
   would be feasible to introduce additional semantics on top of the   
   Multiple-Nexthop Capability so as to allow the ECMP BGP speaker to   
   fully communicate the details of all the paths it is forwarding on,   
   and hence allow those other peers to have full visibility of path   
   information and be able to avoid selecting paths which would   
   otherwise loop, while still maintaining compatibility with speakers   
   not implementing ECMP and Multiple-Hop.
