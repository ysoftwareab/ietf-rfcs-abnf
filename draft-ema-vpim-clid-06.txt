Abstract 
         
This document describes a method for identifying the originating 
calling party in the headers of a stored voice mail message.  Two new
header fields are defined for this purpose: Caller ID and Called Name.
Caller ID is used to store sufficient information for the recipient to 
callback, or reply to, the sender of the message.  Called-name provides
the name of the person sending the message.

1. Introduction 
         
     There is currently a need for a mechanism to identify the
originating party of a voice mail message, outside of the "FROM" header
information. The telephone number and name of the caller are 
typically available from the telephone network, but there is no 
obvious header field to store this in an Internet Mail message. 
         
This information is intended for use when the VPIM message format is
used for storing "Call Answer" voice messages in an Internet Mail 
message store, i.e. the calling party leaves a voice message for the 
recipient, who was unable to answer the call. 
         
[VPIMV2R2] suggests the originating number be included as an Internet
address, using the first method shown below. There are several other
ways to store this information, but they all involve some
manipulation of the "From" field.  For example: 
         
      1. From: "416 555 1234" <non-mail-user@host> 
      2. From: "John Doe" <4165551234@host> 
      3. From:  unknown:; 
         
     As a result, it is useful to be able to store the calling party's
name and number as presented to the called party without manipulation.
This would allow future generation of the proper Internet address, 
and also display of this information to the recipient.  Note that 
there is no requirement to store meta-data (e.g., type of number, 
presentation restricted) as this information is not presented to the 
called party and is generally not available to voice mail systems.  
The intent is to store the information available to an analog 
(non-ISDN) phone (e.g., per [T1.401] in North America). 
         
     [RFC2076] currently lists "phone" as an Internet message header
which would hold the originating party's telephone number, but it is
listed as "non-standard", i.e. usage of this header is not generally
recommended. It also has no defined format, making the information
unparsable. There is no similar entry for the originator's name. 
         
     It is proposed that two new message header fields be included to
hold this information, namely the Calling Line Identification
("Caller-ID"), and Caller Name ("Caller-Name"). 
         
         
2. Conventions used in this document 
         
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3. Calling Line Identification Field 
         
     The Calling Line Identification header ("Caller-ID") is to hold
sufficient information for the recipient to call back, or reply to,
the sender of the message.  This leads to two distinct possibilities:
internal and external calling. 
         
     Note that for both possibilities, the number field MUST contain
only the digits of the number and MUST be representable using the
American Standard Code for Information Interchange [ASCII] character
set; it does not include any separating character (e.g. "-").  
         
     It is expected that default, and likely most common case, will not
have any numbering plan semantic associated with the number. However,
in the case that it is known, an optional "NumberingPlan" parameter
MAY be used to indicate the semantic. 
         
         
3.1 Internal Call 
         
     For an internal call (e.g. between two extensions within the same
company), it is sufficient to relay only the extension of the calling
party, based on the company dialing plan. 
         
         
3.2 External Call 
         
     For an international call, the calling party's number must be the
full international number as described in [E.164], i.e. Country Code
(CC), National Destination Code (NDC) and Subscriber Number (SN).
Other information, such as prefixes or symbols (e.g. "+"), MUST NOT
be included.  This requires provisioning for up to 15 digits. 
         
     For a call within North America, it is also suggested to support
15 digits per [T1.625].  However, some service providers may only
support 10 digits as described in [T1.401] and [GR-31-CORE].  Though 
it is desirable that an international number NOT be truncated to 10
digits if it contains more, it is recognized that this will happen 
due to limitations of various systems. 
         
     Also note that the date and time can be included with the calling
party's telephone number per [T1.401].  This MAY be used, as there is
an existing "Date" Internet header to hold this information.  It is a
local implementation decision whether this time or the local system
time be recorded in the "Date" header.

Note that the other defined fields available to non-analog systems 
(e.g., subaddress, redirecting number), as well as the meta-data, are 
not intended to be stored in this header. 
         
3.3 Numbering Plan 
         
     In this baseline case (i.e., analog lines), no numbering plan
information is known or implied.  However, in the case that a
numbering plan is known, an optional "NumberingPlan" parameter MAY be
used to indicate the semantic.  Only two semantics are defined "local"
and "e164".  "local" is the default if no numbering plan semantic is
included.  Further, "local" has meaning only within the FQDN of the
sending system identified in the RFC 2822 "From" field. "e164".
"e164" indicates that the number is as described in [E.164]. "x-" may
be used to indicate vendor specific dialing plans. 
         
         
4. Caller Name Field 
         
     The name of the person sending the message is also important.  If 
available, it is to be included whether the call is internal or 
external.  This field may not be available on an international call.
         
     Further, the exact format for this field is typically a service
provider option per [T1.641].  It is possible for the caller's name
to be sent in one of several character sets depending on the service
provider signaling transport (e.g., ISDN-UP, SCCP, TCAP).  These
include: 
     1)International Reference Alphabet (IRA), formerly know as 
       International Alphabet No.5 or IA5 [T.50]  
     2)Latin Alphabet No. 1 [8859-1] 
     3)American National Standard Code for Information Interchange 
       [ASCII] 
     4)Character Sets for the International Teletex Service [T.61] 
         
     Of these, the IRA and T.61 character set contains a number of
options that help specify national and application oriented versions.
If there is no agreement between parties to use these options, then the
7-bit character set in which the graphical characters of IRA, T.61
and ASCII are coded exactly the same, will be assumed.  Further, the
7-bit graphical characters of [8859-1] are the same as in [ASCII].
         
     Note that for delivery to customer equipment in North America, the
calling name MUST be presented in ASCII per [T1.401]. 
      
     As a result, for the caller name header defined in this document,
characters are represented with ASCII characters.  However, if a name
is received that cannot be represented in 7-bit ASCII, it MAY be
stored using its native character set as defined in [RFC2047].

In the networks, the length of the name field MUST NOT exceed 50 
characters, as defined in [T1.641].  However, service providers may
chose to limit this further to 15 characters for delivery to customer
equipment, e.g., [T1.401] and [GR-1188-CORE].   
         
         
5. Formal Syntax 
         
     Both Calling Line Identification and Caller Line follow the syntax
specification using the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as described
in [RFC2234].  While the semantics of these headers are defined in
sections 4 and 5, the syntax uses the `unstructured' token defined in
[RFC2822]: 
         
      unstructured = *([FWS] utext) [FWS] 
          
         
5.1 Calling Line Identification Syntax 
         
      "Caller-ID" ":" 1*DIGIT [ "," "NumberingPlan="  
      ( "local" / "e164" / ietf-token / x-token ) ] CRLF 
         
        ietf-token := <An extension token defined by a 
                       standards-track RFC and registered 
                       with IANA.> 
         
        x-token := <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with 
                    no intervening white space, by any token> 
         
         
5.2 Caller Name Syntax 
         
      "Caller-Name" ":" unstructured CRLF 
         
         
5.3 Examples 
         
       To: +19725551212@vm1.mycompany.com 
       Caller-ID: 6137684087 
       Caller-Name: Derrick Dunne 
         
       To: 6137637582@nortelnetworks.com 
       Caller-ID: 6139416900  
       Caller-Name: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Jean_Chr=E9tien?=  
         
         
6. Security Considerations 
         
     There are a few scenarios of how this mechanism may fail that must
be considered.  The first is mentioned in section 3.2 - the truncation
of an international number to 10 digits.  This could result in a 
  
  
       
       
Parsons & Marusak         Expires: 10/06/03                          6
                    Calling Line Identification          January 2003 
      
misinterpretation of the resulting number.  For instance, an 
international number (e.g. from Ireland) of the form "353 91 73 3307"
could be truncated to "53 91 73 3307" if received in North America, 
and interpreted as "539 112 3456" - a seemingly "North American"
style number.  Thus leaving the recipient with the incorrect
information to reply to the message and possibly with an annoyed callee
at the North American number. 
         
     The second scenario is the possibility of sending an internal
extension to an external recipient when a Call Answer message is
forwarded.  This poses two problems, the recipient is given the wrong
phone number, and the company's dialing plan could be exposed. 
         
The final concern deals with exercising character options that are 
available in coding the Calling Name field. An international system
may send a message with coding options that are not available on the 
receiving system. Thus giving the recipient an incorrect Caller Name. 
         
Note that unlisted and restricted numbers are not a concern as these 
header fields are defined to contain what the called party would see 
(e.g., 'Private Name'), as opposed to the complete details exchanged 
between service providers. 
         
     However, it must also be noted that this mechanism allows the 
explicit indication of phone numbers in the headers of an email
message (used to store voice messages).  While the rationale for this
is reviewed in section 1, the recipient of this message may not be 
aware that this information is contained in the headers unless the 
user's client presents the information.  Its use is intended to be 
informative as it is when it would appear on a telephone screen. 
         
7.   IANA Considerations 
         
     This document defines an IANA-administered registration space for 
Caller-ID numbering plans in section 5.1. Each registry entry
consists of an identifying token and a short textual description of
the entry. There are two initial entries in this registry: 
         
     local - The number only has meaning within the FQDN of the  
             sending system identified by the RFC 2822 From field  
             of the message. 
         
     e164  - The number's semantics are described in [E.164]. 
         
The only way to add additional entries (ietf-token in section 5.1) to 
this registry is with a standards-track RFC.
