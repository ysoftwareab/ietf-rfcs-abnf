1. Introduction 
    
   Within the context of this document, the term ?PCELS? (Policy Core 
   Extensions LDAP Scheme) is used to refer to the LDAP class definition 
   that this document contains. 
    
2. Relationship to other Policy Framework Documents 
   
  This document contains an LDAP schema representing the classes 
  defined in the Policy Core Information Model Extensions [PCIM_EXT]. 
  Other documents may subsequently be produced, with mappings of the 
  same PCIM extensions to other storage or transport technologies. 
  The document is an extension to [PCLS], which defines the LDAP 
  mapping of the Policy Core Information Model [PCIM] to an LDAP 
  schema.

4. General Discussion of Mapping the Model Extensions to LDAP 
    
   The classes described below contain certain optimizations for a 
   directory that uses LDAP as an access protocol. One example is the 
   use of auxiliary classes to represent some of the associations 
   defined in the information model. Note that other storage types might 
   need to implement the association differently. 
    
4.1 Summary of Class and Association Mappings 
    
   Twenty of the classes in the PCELS come directly from the sixteen 
   corresponding classes in the information model extensions. The prefix 
   ?pcime? is used to identify these LDAP classes.

4.2 Attaching PolicyVariable and PolicyValues to PolicySimpleCondition 
   and PolicySimpleAction 
    
   A PolicySimpleCondition as well as a PolicySimpleAction includes a 
   single PolicyValue and a single PolicyVariable. Each of them can be 
   attached or referenced by a DN. Both values and variables SHOULD be 
   attached only, because referencing them by a DN places reusability on 
   too low level. Referencing would allow for reusability of a varibale 
   or value but makes it unrealisiticly to retrive policies in a large 
   number, if they contain a number of references to other objects. 
   Using attachment allows the retrieval of the association class and 
   the condition itself in a single LDAP search.  
 
5. Class Definitions  
    
5.1 The five PolicySet Classes 
    
   The abstract class PolicySet in the PCIMe is introduced to provide an 
   abstraction for a set of rules. The class value ?pcimePolicySet? is 
   used as the mechanism for identifying group and rule- related 
   instances in the DIT. PCLS maps this class into three LDAP classes 
   called pcimePolicySet, pcimePolicySetAuxClass and 
   pcimePolicySetInstance.  
    
   In PCIMe [PCIM EXT], PolicyGroup Class and PolicyRule Class are 
   moved, so that they are now derived from PolicySet Class. The class 
   definitions for the other three-remainder classes are listed below. 
   These class definitions do not include attributes to realize the 
   PolicySetComponent, PolicySetInSystem, PolicyGroupInSystem and 
   PolicyRuleInSystem associations from the pcime. This is because a 
   pcimeSetComponent object refers to instances of 
   pcimePolicySetComponent via the attribute 
   pcimeSetComponentAuxContainedSet in the 
   pcimeSetComponentsContainmentAuxClass object class.

   Also, the pcimeSet object refers to instances of pcimSet, pcimeGroup 
   and pcimeRule via, respectively, the attributes: 
   pcimeSetAuxContainedSet, pcimeGroupsAuxContainedSet and 
   pcimeRulesAuxContainedSet in the pcimeSystemContainmentAuxClass 
   object Class. First, the definition of the abstract class 
   pcimePolicySet: 
    
   (<oid- >    NAME "pcimePolicySet" 
      DESC    "An abstract class that is the base class for all classes    
               that describe group and rule-related instances."

      ABSTRACT 
      MAY     (pcimePolicySetName $ pcimRoles) 
   ) 
    
   There are two attributes in the pcimePolicySet: The attribute 
   pcimRoles, which is already defined in [2] and the pcimePolicySetName 
   attribute. 
   The pcimePolicySetName attribute definition is: 
    
   (<oid- >    NAME "pcimePolicySetName"

   ) 
    
   The subclasses of PolicySet are defined as follows. The class 
   pcimePolicySetAuxClass is an auxiliary class that is used to define 
   the evaluation relationship among the rules in the policy set. 
    
   (<oid- >   NAME "pcimePolicySetAuxClass"

      AUXILIARY 
      MAY    (pcimePolicyDecisionStrategy)

   The attribute pcimePolicyDecisionStrategy is used to define the 
   evaluation relationship among the rules in the policy set. 
    
   (<oid- >   NAME "pcimePolicyDecisionStrategy" 
      DESC   "This is the evaluation method used for policies contained   
              in the PolicySet."

   A DIT content rule could be written to enable an instance of 
   pcimePoliySetComponent to have attached to it references to one or 
   more policy set components (using 
   pcimeSetComponentsContainmentAuxClass). Since these semantics do not 
   include specifying any properties of the SetComponent class, the 
   content rule would not need to specify any attribute. 
    
    
5.2 The Auxiliary Class pcimeSimplePolicyCondition 
    
   This class indicates if a specific <variable> match with a specific 
   <value>. The "match" relationship is to be interpreted by analyzing 
   the variable and value instances associated with the simple 
   condition. 
   There is an attribute to realize 
   pcimePolicyValueinSimplePolicyCondition and 
   pcimePolicyVariableinSimplePolicyCondition associations  
   The class definition is as follows:

   There are two attributes that must be in the 
   pcimeSimplePolicyCondition class: The attribute pcimeVariable and 
   pcimeValue. 
   The pcimeVariable attribute definition is:

   This class contains an attribute to represent one property of the 
   PCIMe PolicyVariableInSimplePolicyCondition association, 
   pcimeVariableDN and one property of the PCIMe 
   PolicyValueInSimplePolicyCondition association, pcimeValueDN.  The 
   first property is used to attach a variable to a 
   SimplePolicyCondition and the second one is used to attach a value to 
   a SimplePolicyCondition. The SimpleConditions themselves are 
   represented by auxiliary subclasses of the auxiliary class 
   pcimeSimplePolicyCondition. 
    
   The class definition is as follows: 
    
   (<oid- >   NAME "pcimeSimpleConditionAssociation" 
      DESC   "This class contains attributes characterizing the

   This class represents a compound policy condition, formed by 
   aggregation of simple policy conditions. There is an attribute 
   representing a Boolean combination of simpler conditions. 
    
   The class definition is as follows: 
    
   (<oid- >   NAME "pcimeCompoundPolicyCondition"

      MUST   (pcimeConditionListType) 
   ) 
    
   The attribute pcimeConditionListType is used to specify whether the 
   list of policy conditions associated with this compound policy 
   condition is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) or conjunctive normal 
   form (CNF). It is defined as follows: 
    
   (<oid- >   NAME "pcimeConditionListType"

5.5 The Class pcimeConditionStructuresContainmentAuxClass 
    
   The compound policy conditions apply the DNF/CNF logic from PCIMe 
   policyConditionInPolicyRule aggregation to a compound condition that 
   aggregates simpler conditions, to achieve this purpose there is a 
   class pcimeConditionStructuresContainmentAuxClass that has two 
   sublcasses: pcimeConditionAssociation and 
   pcimeRuleConditionAssociation (moved from PCIM). 
    
    (<oid- >  NAME "pcimeConditionStructureContainmentAuxClass"

   The PCIMe [1] defines a PolicyVariable abstract class. PCLS maps this 
   class into three LDAP classes called pcimePolicyVariable, 
   pcimePolicyVariableAuxClass and pcimePolicyVariableInstance. Also, 
   pcimePolicyExplicitVariableAuxClass and 
   pcimePolicyImplicitVariableInstance are subclasses of the 
   pcimePolicyVariable.  
   Variables specify the property of a flow or an event that should be 
   matched when evaluating the condition. A given variable selects the 
   set of matchable value types through the 
   ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association. 
   The classes definitions are as follows. First, the definition of the 
   abstract class pcimePolicyVariable: 
    
   (<oid- >   NAME "pcimePolicyVariable" 
      DESC   "An auxiliary class that set the value to the variable"  
      SUP     pcimPolicy

      MUST   (pcimeVariable $ pcimeValue)

   The subclasses of pcimePolicyVariable are defined as follows. The 
   class pcimePolicyVariableAuxClass is an auxiliary class that is used 
   to define the relationship among the variables into Simple Policy 
   Actions

   needed to add the pcimeReusablePolicyContainer and two subclasses: 
   pcimeReusablePolicyContainerInstance (structural) and 
   pcimeReusablePolicyContainerAuxClass(auxiliary). The class 
   pcimeReusablePolicyContainer is defined as an abstract class so 
   pcimeReusablePolicyContainer subclasses are needed in order to 
   instanciate classes in the directory. 
    
   2.We have to add the subclasses pcimeRuleActionAssociationAuxClass 
   and pcimeActionAssociationauxClass  
    
   3. We have to clarify next classes  
   pcimePolicyVariableAuxClass. 
    pcimePolicyVariableInstance. 
    pcimePolicyExplicitVariableAuxClass. 
    pcimePolicyImplicitVariableInstance. 
    
   4. We have to clarify the mapping of next classes  
   PolicyValue and their subclasses. 
    PolicyImpliciyVariable subclasses. 
    
    
   We also consider the next points: 
   5. To define classes to search errors and classes to detect failures 
   in the system 
   6. Because of the policy server is centralized and the LDAP is 
   distributed hierarchically could be necessary to add classes in order

   to find duplicates in the information. It can occur, for example when 
   updating is excessively often. 
   7. Mapping between Network domains and the updating of information. 
    
   Servers via resource management programs could manage some of these 
   topics, even though it is necessary to add specific classes.
