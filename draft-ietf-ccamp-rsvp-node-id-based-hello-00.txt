Abstract 
    
   Use of node-id based RSVP Hello messages is implied in a number of 
   cases, e.g., when data and control plan are separated, when TE links 
   are unnumbered. Furthermore, when link level failure detection is 
   performed by some means other than RSVP Hellos, use of node-id based 
   Hellos is optimal for detecting signaling adjacency failure for RSVP-
   TE. Nonetheless, this implied behavior is unclear and this document

1. Terminology 
                   
   Node-id: Router-id as advertised in the Router Address TLV for OSPF 
   [OSPF-TE] and Traffic Engineering router ID TLV for ISIS [ISIS-TE]. 
    
   Node-id based Hello Session: A Hello session such that local and 
   remote node-ids are used in the source and destination fields of the 
   Hello packet, respectively. 
    
   Interface bounded Hello Session: A Hello session such that local and 
   remote addresses of the interface in question are used in the source 
   and destination fields of the Hello packet, respectively.  
       
2. Introduction 
 
   The RSVP Hello message exchange was introduced in [RFC 3209]. The 
   usage of RSVP Hello has been extended in [RFC 3473] to support RSVP 
   Graceful Restart (GR) procedures. Specifically, [RFC 3473] specifies 
   the use of the RSVP Hellos for GR procedures for Generalized MPLS 
   (GMPLS). GMPLS introduces the notion of control plane and data plane 
   separation. In other words, in GMPLS networks, the control plane 
   information is carried over a control network whose end-points are IP 
   capable, and which may be physically or logically disjoint from the 
   data bearer links it controls. One of the consequences of separation 
   of data bearer links from control channels is that RSVP Hellos are 
   not terminated on  data bearer links’ interfaces even if (some of) 
   those are numbered. Instead RSVP hellos are terminated at the control 
   channel (IP-capable) end-points. The latter MAY be identified by the 
   value assigned to the node hosting these control channels i.e. Node-
   Id. Consequently, the use of RSVP Hellos for GR applications 
   introduces a need for clarifying the behavior and usage of node-id 
   based Hellos. 
    
   Even in the case of packet MPLS, when link failure detection is 
   performed by some means other than RSVP Hellos (e.g., [BFD]), the use 
   of node-id based Hellos is also optimal for detection of signaling 
   adjacency failures for RSVP-TE. Similarly, when all TE links between 
   neighbor nodes are unnumbered, it is implied that the nodes will use 
   node-id based Hellos for detection of signaling adjacency failures. 
   This document also clarifies the use of node-id based Hellos when all 
   or a sub-set of TE links are unnumbered. This draft also clarifies 
   use of node-id based Hellos in these scenarios.  
 
3. Node-id based RSVP Hellos

   A node-id based Hello session is established through the exchange of 
   RSVP Hello messages such that local and remote node-ids are 
   respectively used in the source and destination fields of Hello 
   packets. Here, node-id refers to a router-id as defined in the Router 
   Address TLV for OSPF [OSPF-TE] and the Traffic Engineering router ID 
   TLV for ISIS [ISIS-TE]. This section formalizes a procedure for 
   establishing node-id based Hello sessions. 
    
   If a node wishes to establish a node-id based RSVP Hello session with 
   its neighbor, it sends a Hello message with its node-id in the source 
   IP address field of the Hello packet. Furthermore, the node also puts 
   the neighbor’s node-id in the destination address field of the IP 
   packet.  
    
   When a node receives a Hello packet where the destination IP address 
   is its local node-id as advertised in the IGP-TE topology, the node 
   MUST use its node-id in replying to the Hello message. In other 
   words, nodes must ensure that the node-ids used in RSVP Hello 
   messages are those derived/contained in the IGP-TE topology. 
   Furthermore, a node can only run one node-id based RSVP Hello session 
   per IGP instance (i.e., per node-id pair) with its neighbor. 
    
   In the case of packet MPLS, when link failure detection is performed 
   by some means other than RSVP Hellos, use of node-id based Hellos is 
   also optimal in detecting signaling adjacency failures, e.g., for 
   RSVP GR procedure. Similarly, if all interfaces between a pair of 
   nodes are unnumbered, the optimal way to use RSVP to detect signaling 
   adjacency failure is to run node-id based Hellos. Furthermore, in the 
   case of optical network with single or multiple, numbered or 
   unnumbered control channels, use of node-id based Hellos for 
   detecting signaling adjacency failure is also optimal. Therefore, 
   when link failure detection is performed by some means other than 
   RSVP Hellos, or if all interfaces between a pair of nodes are 
   unnumbered, or in GMPLS network with data and control plane 
   separation, a node MUST run node-id based Hellos for detection of 
   signaling adjacency failure for RSVP-TE. Nonetheless, if it is 
   desirable to distinguish between signaling adjacency and link 
   failures, node id based Hellos can co-exist with interface bound 
   Hellos messages. Similarly, if a pair of nodes share numbered and 
   unnumbered TE links, node id and interface based Hellos can co-exist.  
    
4. Backward Compatibility Note 
    
   The procedure presented in this document is backward compatible with 
   both [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
