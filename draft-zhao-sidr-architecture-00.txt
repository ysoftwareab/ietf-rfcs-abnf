1. Introduction 

1.1. Overview 

   This document describes an architecture for secure inter-domain 
   routing (BGP [RFC4271]). The architecture consists of components (i.e. 
   functional modules) which address the requirements mentioned in 
   [REQUIREMENT]. The draft describes interfaces (i.e. security services) 
   that the architecture provides to routing engine as well. 

   EDITORS NOTE: This is an early draft. Additional work will be needed. 
   Functional models should be refined and interfaces should be defined 
   as well. 

1.2. Traditional Inter-Autonomous Routing System 

   An inter-autonomous routing system can be modeled simply as follow: 

   o ASes (autonomous systems). Each has a single interior routing plan 
      and uses inter-domain routing protocol (BGP) to determine how to 
      route packets to others. 

   o BGP sessions. ASes are interconnected to each other by EBGP 
      session and form a network of ASes. 

   o Route objects. A route object consisting of network reachability 
      information and relevant attributes is transmitted between ASes. 
      In general it is contained in the BGP UPDATE. ASes originate and 
      re-generate route objects and exchange them through established 
      BGP sessions. 

1.3. Goals of the architecture 

     1. The architecture should use existing SIDR (Secure Inter-Domain 
     Routing) solutions as a reference and should be consistent to them 
     mostly. BGP security has been studies during the past decade and a 
 
 
Zhao                  Expires January 20, 2007                [Page 3] 

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

     number of solutions have been proposed. Each solution addresses 
     some aspects of the issues, so one important goal of this 
     architecture is consistency to these ideas and different deployment 
     scenarios.  

     2. Potential requirements must be taken into account. For example, 
     when a new attributes type is introduced in the future, the 
     architecture still can be kept stable. 

     3. Incremental deployment is a MUST requirement listed in section 
     3.2 of [REQUIREMENT] and is an architecture requirement as well. A 
     proposed security system MUST be able to coexist with traditional 
     systems (compatible with prior BGP system) and support incremental 
     additions of functional module.

                      Figure 1: Architecture of SIDR 

   The figure above depicts the architecture of BGP security and its 
   relationship with the BGP routing engine. The routing engine invokes 
   the interfaces to obtain security services. 

2.1. BGP Routing engine 

   From an implementation point of view, a BGP routing engine consists 
   of three functional modules. Each functional module may be affected 
   by BGP security requirements. 

   o Input Policy. 

   Input policy contains rules to filter route information received from 
   peers. In a SIDR system, input policy may be affected through 
   introducing security rules. 

   o Route Selection. 

   Route selection is a complex procedure to determine a best path to a 
   specific destination. In a SIDR system, security should be considered 
   in this procedure.

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

   o Output Policy. 

   Output policy contains rules to determine which routes could be 
   advertised to peers. The output policy may be affected by introduced 
   security rules as well. 

2.2. BGP Security Architecture 

   This BGP security architecture includes several components: 

   o Payload Security 

   As mentioned in section 1.3 of [REQUIREMENT], the data payload of the 
   protocol is one primary point where BGP may be secured. "Payload 
   security" functional module serves for this purpose.  

   o Semantics Security 

   This module is used to verify authenticity of entities of BGP system 
   and relationships among them.  

   o Security Mechanism 

   These mechanisms are basic security components which will be invoked 
   by payload and semantics security components. 

   Some standard security protocols such as IPSec, TLS and so on are all 
   included. 

   o Other mechanisms 

   This section describes the mechanisms which will not be invoked 
   directly by the routing engine, but is necessary to SIDR system. 
   Generally, they are not directly correlative with security 
   requirements. 

   These mechanisms may include key management, trust module, 
   transportation and storage of security data. 

2.3. Interface provided to BGP Routing engine 

   The architecture provides interfaces through which the routing engine 
   obtains security services. These services include verifying the 
   validation of an entity in BGP system, verifying the relationship 
   between entities, inserting security information into PDUs (Protocol 
   Data Unit), processing security information in received PDUs and so 
   on.

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

   NOTE: Such interfaces are not necessarily implemented in one device. 
   For example, [IRV] proposes a solution in which a router consults a 
   dedicated server to verify an UPDATE. 

3. BGP Security Architecture 

   The architecture focuses on functional partitioning, which concerns 
   more about what to do. Each component in it is a functional module. 
   [REQUIREMENT] is a guideline and restriction document to implement 
   these functional modules.  

   Section 1.3 of [REQUIREMENT] mentions two primary points in BGP 
   security, the data payload and the data semantics security of the 
   protocol which are all basic components of the architecture. Section 
   3 of [REQUIREMENT] lists some operational restrictions which could be 
   referenced during designing specific functions. 

3.1. Payload Security 

   o Payload Security of a BGP session 

   This module mainly offers services to secure a BGP session between 
   ASes including protecting establishment and closure of a BGP session 
   and transportation of BGP protocol data. These services may include 
   data integrity, anti-replay, data origin authentication, peer entity 
   authentication and so on. 

   Generally, the security services will affect the efficiency of a 
   routing system, which is one restriction when designing this 
   functional module. Requirements in section 3.1 and 3.5 of 
   [REQUIREMENT] should be referenced.  

   A feasible solution may be implemented in different layers, such as 
   the network layer, the transport layer and the application layer. 
   IPSec, TCP MD5 option, TLS are all candidates. [TCPAUTH] proposes a 
   new option to secure a TCP session, which can be regarded as an 
   enhance version of the TCP MD5 option and can provide a integrality 
   service to a BGP session.  

   o Payload Security during the Propagation of an UPDATE Message 

   This module provides security services to protect propagation of a 
   UPDATE Message.  

   For example, an origin AS may sign specific attributes in a UPDATE in 
   order to make other ASes in the AS_PATH to verify whether information 
   has been modified during the transportation. 
 
 
Zhao                  Expires January 20, 2007                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

   Since this is a BGP problem, relevant services should be provided in 
   the application layer. 

3.2. Semantics Security 

   Semantics Security is a central component of the architecture. It 
   focuses on the authenticity of SIDR entities and relationships 
   between them. Whether an AS number is valid is an example of the 
   former. Whether an AS is authorized to originate an address prefix by 
   its address holder is an example of the latter. 

   Current deployment mechanisms, such as route filters, are used to 
   deal with some semantics problems. One example is to filter bogon 
   address prefixes. Another example is to determine whether an origin 
   AS is listed in AS_PATH attribute. 

   Generally, semantics security protects two aspects: authenticity of 
   entities and authenticity of relationships. 

3.2.1. Semantics Security of SIDR entities 

   Authenticity of entities is the precondition to validate relationship. 
   There are several top level entities in a SIDR system: ASes, address 
   holders, route objects.  

   NOTE: In current BGP system, ASes trust each other and address 
   holders need not participate. However, in a SIDR system, an address 
   holder needs to authorize ASes to originate its prefix so it is a 
   necessary entity. 

3.2.1.1. AS (autonomous system) 

   o the authenticity of an AS 

   An AS number is an identity of an AS. This functional module is used 
   to determine if a specific AS number is valid and to verify related 
   identity claimed by an AS. 

3.2.1.1.1. Entities inside an AS 

   An AS is a complicated system and consists of various components, 
   such as ASBR (AS border router), RR (route reflector), PE (provider 
   edge) and so on. Not all BGP entities need to participate in a SIDR 
   system or at least different entities may play different roles. 

   On the one hand route information is originated from inside of an AS 
   such as static route and IGP route, on the other hand 
 
 
Zhao                  Expires January 20, 2007                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

   misconfigurations and deliberate attacks toward AS are root of 
   problems we faces. Therefore, a complete SIDR system may include 
   components to ensure security inside an AS and should protect AS from 
   advertising invalid UPDATEs. 

   o the authenticity of an ASBR 

   An ASBR (AS border router) is a BGP speaker router which is 
   responsible for advertising route information representing the AS. 
   This functional module is to validate if a speaker has the identity 
   claimed by it. 

   o the authenticity of other entities 

   TBD. 

3.2.1.2. Address Holder 

   o the authenticity of an address holder 

   An address holder, such as IANA, RIR, did not appear in the 
   traditional BGP system. Since validation of a prefix and whether an 
   AS is authorized to advertise a prefix are all concerned by SIDR. An 
   address holder is supposed to participate in the SIDR system. 

   This module is to validating if an address holder is a valid holder. 

3.2.1.3. Route Object 

   The term "route object" mainly refers to prefixes and related path 
   attributes conveyed in a BGP UPDATE message.  

3.2.1.3.1. Authenticity of a Prefix 

   A valid prefix should be an allocated global unicast address. 
   Allocation of IPv4 address space can be consulted from [IANA]. 

3.2.1.3.2. Authenticity of Attributes 

   EDITORS NOTE: attributes should be classified in order to be 
   compatible with new attributes. This may be potential work items. 

   o Authenticity of an AS_PATH attribute 

   Validation of AS_PATH is mentioned in section 1.3 of [REQUIREMENT]. 
   The first category summarized in it is whether the AS_PATH actually 
   exists. Since BGP is a path vector protocol and does not maintain a 
 
 
Zhao                  Expires January 20, 2007                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

   topology, there is not a protocol mechanism to resolve this problem. 
   This functional module focuses on the problem. It is used to check if 
   an AS_PATH is a valid path in the network. 

   NOTE [SoBGP] proposes a topology map to resolve this problem. 
   Existence of an AS path may not mean its validation. A further demand 
   may be a valley-free path, but it is difficult to validate such 
   semantics. 

   o Authenticity of Other path attributes 

   TBD. 

3.2.2. Semantics Security of Entities Relationship 

   This section describes relationships between the entities mentioned 
   above. In particular this includes relationships about prefixes 
   authorization and relationship occurring during propagation of route 
   information.  

3.2.2.1. Relationship about Prefix Authorization 

   Following table depict potential relationships about prefixes 
   authorization. 

   +--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+

   |              |                |                |                  |

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

   o Ownership of an Address 

   The ownership of an address is the anchor of subsequent authorization.  

   This functional module is used to verify whether an address holder 
   own specific prefixes. 

   o Prefix Authorization 

   This function module involves several types of authorization as 
   follows: 

   - Is a subordinate address holder authorized to own specific prefixes 
   by an upper address holder? 

   - Is an AS authorized to originate specific prefixes by an address 
   holder or another AS? 

   - Is a router authorized to advertise specific prefixes representing 
   a specific AS? 

3.2.2.2. Relationship during Transitive of Route Objects 

   Since route processing is a per-hop based behavior, except for 
   immediate ASes, a receiver could not tell which AS an UPDATE has 
   arrived at. 

   o Authenticity of AS_PATH Travel. 

   This function is used to verify whether the UPDATE has actually 
   traveled the ASes listed in AS_PATH. 

3.2.2.3. Other Relationship 

   o Relationship between ASes 

   Do two ASes really interconnect each other? 

3.3. Security Mechanism 

3.3.1. Certificate Mechanism 

   In this document, a certificate means a public-key certificate which 
   binds a public/private key pair to a specific subject. It may also 
   include extensions about the subject. 


 
 
Zhao                  Expires January 20, 2007               [Page 11] 

Internet-Draft    Architecture to Secure Inter-Domain Routing  July 2006 
    

   In SIDR system, a certificate mechanism serves for identity 
   authentication, data integrality validation and prefix authorization.  

   NOTE: Generally lifetime of a subject is longer than validity period 
   of authorization, so it may be not adequate to convey a short-term 
   authorization in a public-key certificate. 

3.3.2. Signed Digital Data Object 

   A signed digital data object is used to convey authorizations and 
   policies to specific subjects and is protected by a digital signature. 
   For example, it can be used to verify whether an AS is authorized to 
   advertise a block of address space. 

3.3.3. Protection Mechanisms of BGP Session 

   Mechanisms to protecting BGP sessions serve for payload security, 
   which may include data integrity, anti-replay, peer authentication, 
   etc. 

   Some standardized security protocols provide these mechanisms, such 
   as IPSec, TLS. [TCPAUTH] proposes a lightweight solution to provide 
   an integrality service to  a TCP session. 

3.3.4. Others 

   TBD.

   With regard to trust models in SIDR systems, there are two issues 
   involved. One is which type of underlying trust model to choose. The 
   other is how to cooperate with a SIDR system which has a different 
   trust model. The former is a business issue which depends on 
   practical requirements. The latter is an unsolved technical issue.  

   Section 5 of [REQUIREMENT] mentions some requirements about the trust 
   model. From the point of view of this architecture, an underlying 
   trust model should be transparent to the routing engineer. 

3.4.2. Transportation and Storage of Security Data 

   TBD.
