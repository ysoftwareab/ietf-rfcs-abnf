1. Introduction 

   Simple IP Multi-homing means the host connects to more than one 
   physical network through different network interfaces, and assigns 
   different network flows to each interface, and ensure all the 
   interfaces can deliver the flow simultaneously.  

   Current the operating systems only allow one default network 
   connection. If there are multiple connections of the host, all the 
   flows will go to the default gateway based on RFC1122 description. 
   One default gateway guarantees the host always has one entry to the 
   network, but lead to the multiple connections be difficult. The most 
   convenient way to make the host work under several networks at the 
   same time is to add specific static route in the host route table, so 
   that certain flow can use the assigned interface while others use the 
   default one, but it is not easy for the ordinary users to handle it. 
   We analyze this problem statement in another IETF draft 'draft-hui-
   ip-multiple-connections-ps-01'. 

   In this document we will illustrate the specific scenario and give a 
   probable solution by extending DHCPv4.

2. Scenario  

   Simple IP Multi-homing is a necessary part of daily life. For example, 
   Mike must connect with the VPN by Ethernet interface when he is at 
   work, at the same time he wants to watch the stock market, which is 
   prohibited in the VPN, so he needs another connection to the GPRS 
   network simultaneously. 

   The problem is Mike can not use two connections at the same time for 
   his different service requirement, because all the IP flows go to the 
   same interface which is related to the default gateway in the host 
   routing table. That is the point need to be solved in simple IP 
   multi-homing.

3. Solution  

   The default gateway problem can be solved by applying routing policy 
   in the host. 

3.1. Routing policy 

   The routing policy can be applied in the host so that different IP 
   flows can go to different interfaces depending on the polices. To 
   maintain a simple host routing table, the policy can be allocated by 
   the network side, i.e. the gateway. The policy is distributed to the 
   host as soon as it attaches to the gateway, and the policy will be 
   applied in the initial procedure of the host. 

   The routing policy information should contain the proper interface 
   allocation according to IP destination and service type. For doing 
   this, IP flows can go to the appropriate network, and all connections 
   can work simultaneously.    

3.2. DHCP extension 

   DHCP is a proper message to carry the host routing policy information, 
   for DHCP take effect when host first attach to the network, and DHCP 
   is a universal protocol used in the host IP deployment between 
   network gateway and host. 

   To carry the host routing information, DHCP should make an extension 
   in the DHCP option field. The format is showed as follow:

                      Figure 1 DHCP extension format. 

   Code is a number represents the specific DHCP option, which needs to 
   be assigned by IANA. 

   Len represents the length of the option form the byte after the Len 
   field. 

   Destination is the Destination IP address of the datagram, occupying 
   4 byte. Mask field represents the subnet mask of the destination.   

   TOS follows the definition in RFC1349, and it represents the 
   requirement of specific IP flow, such as bandwidth and delay.  

   Router is the IP address of the network gateway. Either the router 
   interface address or the corresponding host interface address is 
   suitable. 

3.3. Configuration procedure 

   The DHCP routing policy is carried in the DHCP message, when host 
   requires IP configuration as soon as it first attaches the network, 
   DHCP server will send the routing policy together with the IP 
   configuration to the host. 

   Then the routing policy carried on the DHCP message is obtained by 
   the host, and applied as the static routing entries in the host 
   routing table.

Internet-Draft         IP Multiple Connections           November 2008 
    

   When it comes to the source address selection of the datagram, the 
   host operating system will look up the routing table according to the 
   destination IP address first, if it finds an available routing, the 
   interface of this routing will be used to send out the datagram, and 
   the IP address of this interface is selected to be the source address 
   of the datagram. The detail of the source address selection is 
   described in RFC1122 and RFC3484. 

   So that the static routing entry can constrain specific IP flow to 
   certain interface. Depending on the destination and TOS, the IP flow 
   can find a proper router as the next hop, and goes out through the 
   corresponding interface. Thus different IP flows can use multiple 
   connections properly and simultaneously.
