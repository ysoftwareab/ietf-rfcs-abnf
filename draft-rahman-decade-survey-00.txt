1. Introduction

   The DECADE (DECoupled Application Data Enroute) working group is
   chartered to design and standardize an architecture and protocol
   that will enable Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications to utilize network

Internet-Draft       An Additional DECADE Survey              June 2010


   based storage systems as described in [I-D.draft-song-decade-
   problem-statement].

   In this draft, we propose considering two key systems in addition to
   the DECADE survey of existing in-network storage [I-D.draft-song-
   decade-survey]. These systems include both P2P and other modes and
   help provide further useful insights for DECADE. This document
   responds to the call made at the IETF #77 meeting by the WG chair,
   requesting the group to contribute to enhancing the existing survey.


2. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3. Photo Sharing

   There are a growing number of popular on line Photo Sharing
   (storing) systems.  For example, the Kodak Gallery system
   [KodakGallery01] serves over 60 million users and stores billions of
   images [KodakGallery02].  Other well known examples of Photo Sharing
   systems include Flickr [Flickr] and ImageShack [ImageShack].  Also
   there a number of popular blogging services, such as Tumblr
   [Tumblr], which specialize in also sharing large number of photos
   and other multimedia content (e.g. video, text, audio, etc.) as part
   of their  service.  All these in-network storage systems utilize
   both free and paid subscription models.

   Most Photo Sharing systems use traditional client-server
   architecture.  However, a minority of systems also offer a P2P mode
   of operation.



3.1. Data Access Interface

   Users can read (view) and write (store) objects (photos).

Internet-Draft       An Additional DECADE Survey              June 2010


3.2. Data Management Operations

   Users can delete previously stored objects (photos).



3.3. Data Search Capability

   Users can tag objects (photos) and/or organize them using
   sophisticated web photo album generators. Users can then search for
   objects (photos) matching desired criteria.



3.4. Access Control Authorization

   We consider three types of Access Control Authorization: Public-
   unrestricted, Public-restricted, and Private. Public-unrestricted
   refers to content that is widely available to anyone (e.g.
   Wikipedia.com). Public-restricted refers to content that is
   available to a public which is restricted by certain criteria (e.g.
   country or region), but does not require any confidential
   credentials from the client. Finally, Private refers to content that
   is only made available to clients presenting the required
   credentials (e.g. password or key).

   In the case of Photo Sharing, access to stored objects (photos)
   typically can be Private, or Public-unrestricted.



3.5. Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.



3.6. Discovery Mechanism

   Usually by logging on to a central web page for the service and
   entering the appropriate information to access the desired
   information.

Internet-Draft       An Additional DECADE Survey              June 2010


3.7. Storage Mode

   Objects (photos) are usually stored as files.  They can then be
   organized into meta-structures (e.g. albums, galleries, etc.) using
   sophisticated web photo album generators.



4.  Web Mail

   Web Mail systems are email services primarily accessed via a web
   browser as opposed to a desktop email client.  Well known examples
   of Web Mail systems are Google Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Microsoft
   Hotmail.  A key aspect of these web based mail systems is that they
   offer a relatively large amount of in-network storage to store
   emails and attachments.  The amount of network storage typically
   starts from 1GB free of charge, and goes up to larger amounts which
   may be charged.  Some Web Mail systems, such as Yahoo, now claim to
   offer "unlimited amount of (network) storage" [WebMail].  All Web
   Mail systems use traditional client-server architecture.



4.1. Data Access Interface

   Users can read and write objects (email).



4.2. Data Management Operations

   Users can delete previously stored objects (email).



4.3. Data Search Capability

   Users can tag objects (email) and/or organize them into folders.
   Users can then search for objects (email) matching desired criteria
   (including searching text within the body of the email).



4.4. Access Control Authorization

   Access is Private.

4.5. Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.



4.6. Discovery Mechanism

   Not provided.



4.7. Storage Mode

   Objects (email) are usually stored as files.  They can then be
   organized into directories.



5. Conclusions

   This draft describes two additional key in-network storage systems,
   Photo Sharing and Web Mail, to be considered for the DECADE survey
   of existing storage technologies.  These two systems are very
   popular and store a large amount of cumulative data in the network
   and thus are instructive to consider for DECADE.



6. Security Considerations

   This draft is a survey of existing in-network storage systems, and
   does not introduce any security considerations beyond those of the
   surveyed systems.



7. IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
