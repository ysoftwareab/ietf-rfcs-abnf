Abstract

   This draft addresses the problems of routing datagrams to nodes
   located in an IPv6 mobile network. A mobile network is one or more
   IP-subnets attached to a mobile router and mobile as a unit.  The
   mobile router dynamically changes its point of attachment.
   Applications of mobile networks include networks attached to people
   (PANs) and networks of sensors deployed in an aircraft, a boat, or a
   car.

   Mobile IPv6 [4] is a solution that has been developed to support
   mobile nodes, i.e. mobile hosts and mobile routers. We discuss its
   ability to support an entire network attached to a mobile router and

   show, by means of an experiment, that the Home Agent is unable to
   redirect packets to the mobile network, and that optimal routing can
   not be performed.  Indeed, some implementations may interpret the
   Mobile IPv6 specification in a way that would allow the HA to
   redirect packets to the mobile network, but we advocate that is
   surely leading to misinterpretation and therefore pitfalls.

   We therefore propose to extend Mobile IPv6 with Prefix Scope Binding
   Updates to support mobile networks in the Internet.  Prefix Scope
   Binding Updates both allow redirection from the HA to the mobile
   network in a clean way and optimal routing.  Prefix Scope Binding
   Updates contain a binding between a prefix and a care-of address.
   All nodes in the mobile network share the same Mobile Network Prefix
   and the care-of address belongs to the Mobile Router.  As a result of
   the reception of a Prefix Scope Binding Update, the receiver is able
   to route via the care-of address of the Mobile Router all packets
   intended to nodes in the mobile network.

Introduction

   Mobile IPv4 [8] and Mobile IPv6 [4] have introduced mobility support
   for IPv4 and IPv6 [3] nodes respectively. The purpose of mobility
   support is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to mobile
   nodes. Mobile IP is a solution to support mobile nodes but does not
   handle mobile networks.

   There are situations where an entire network might move and attach to
   different places in the Internet topology. In this draft, we refer to
   a network as a set of nodes that share the same IP prefix and that
   are attached to the Internet through a single border router. We refer
   to a mobile network as a network whose border router dynamically
   changes its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its
   reachability in the IP topology. A mobile network may be composed by
   one or more IP-subnets.  The internal architecture of a mobile
   network is preserved while it is roaming. As such, nodes in the
   mobile network do not move with respect to the others and shouldn't
   take part in mobility management.

   Applications of mobile networks include networks attached to people
   (Personal Area Network or PANs) and networks of sensors deployed in
   aircrafts, boats, cars, trains, etc. (see [8] section 4.5).  As an
   example of a mobile network, we could imagine that an airways company
   provides permanent on-board Internet connectivity. This allows all
   passengers to use their laptops to connect to remote hosts, download
   music or video from any provider, or browse the web. The Internet
   could also be used to exchange information between the aircraft and
   air traffic control stations. During the flight, the aircraft changes

   its point of attachment to the Internet and is reachable by distinct
   IP addresses owned by distinct Internet service providers. This
   scenario justifies that mobile networks may be of a big size,
   containing hundreds of hosts and several routers and may attach to
   very distant parts of the Internet topology.

   Although the designers of Mobile IPv4 claim that it could support
   mobile networks equally as mobile nodes ([8] section 4.5, [9] section
   5.12, [7] section 11.2), we argue that this is not true for Mobile
   IPv6.  Indeed, we have carefully studied the adequacy of Mobile IPv6
   for supporting mobile networks and we came to the conclusion that
   some modifications are needed to support them.

 2.2. Mobile Network specific terms

      Mobile Network
         A set of nodes which are mobile, as a unit, with respect to the
         rest of the Internet, i.e. a Mobile Router and all its attached
         nodes.  The Mobile Router is dynamically changing its point of
         attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the IP
         topology.  All nodes in the mobile network share the same IP
         prefix: the Mobile Network Prefix.  Note that a Mobile Network
         may be composed by one or more IP-subnets.

      Mobile IP-subnet
         A Mobile Network that is limited to a single IP-subnet.

      Mobile Router (MR)

         The border router of the mobile network which attaches the
         mobile network to the rest of the Internet.  The MR has (at
         least) two interfaces. The first interface is attached to the
         home link if the mobile network is at home, or it is attached
         to a foreign link if the mobile network is in a foreign

         network.  Other interfaces are attached to links internal to
         the mobile network and are configured with the Mobile Network
         Prefix (see below).  The Mobile Router maintains the Internet
         connectivity for the mobile network.  It is used to route
         packets between the mobile network and the fixed Internet.

      Stationary Node (SN)
         Any host or router permanently located within the mobile
         network and that is fixed with respect to the MR.

      Visiting Mobile Node (VN)
         A Mobile Node mobile with respect to the mobile network that is
         temporarily visiting the mobile network and whose home network
         is not the mobile network itself.  A VN may visit the mobile
         network and obtain a care-of address from a router within the
         mobile network.

      Local Mobile Node
         A Mobile Node mobile with respect to the mobile network whose
         home network is the mobile network itself.

      Node behind the MR
         A node behind the MR is a Mobile Network Node (MNN).  See
         definition of MNN.

      Mobile Network Node (MNN)
         Any host or router located within the mobile network, either
         permanently or temporarily. (Mobile Router, Stationary Node,
         Visiting mobile Node or a Local mobile Node).  From the fixed
         network, a MNN is seen as a "Node behind the Mobile Router".

      Correspondent Node (CN)
         External nodes corresponding with one or more MNNs of the
         mobile network.

      Foreign Gateways (FGs)
         Subsequent points of attachment of the mobile network

      Mobile Network Prefix

         The network prefix that is common to all IP addresses in the
         Mobile Network when the Mobile Router is attached to the home
         link. For a mobile network containing only one subnet, the
         Mobile Network Prefix is the prefix of this subnet ("home
         subnet prefix" as defined in [4]). Note that the Mobile Network
         Prefix is NOT the home subnet prefix (i.e. the IP subnet prefix
         corresponding to the mobile node's home address, as defined in
         [4]).

         An organization wishing to support larger mobile networks may
         decide to split the SLA field of the IPv6 address in several
         sub-fields (SLA1, SLA2).  In this case, the mobile network may
         be identified by a unique SLA1 field.  If the length of the
         SLA1 field is 8 bits, the length of the Mobile Network Prefix
         is 60 bits and the mobile network could contain up to 2^4
         subnets.

      Figure 1 illustrates a mobile network attached to its home link.
      In figure 2, the mobile network has moved and attaches to a
      foreign link.  Figure 3 illustrates a larger mobile network.

 2.3. Assumptions

   In order to keep things as simple as possible, we make the following
   assumptions in our draft:

      o the mobile network attaches to the Internet through only one



Ernst & Bellier         Expires 22 December 2001                [Page 7]

      mobile router.

      o the mobile router is not multihomed.

      o all nodes and interfaces in the mobile network are configured
      with a common and unique prefix: the mobile network prefix.

      o nodes behind the Mobile Router (MNNs) are only Stationary Nodes
      (SNs).  We therefore do not consider nodes mobile with respect to
      the mobile network, i.e. neither local nor visiting mobile nodes
      (see section 2.2 for the terminology) as this is illustrated on
      figure 4.

   Note that the proposal outlined in this draft is not limited to the
   above assumptions.  The purpose of this draft is to allow
   communication between a CN and a SN.  It may also be adapted to the
   particular case of Visiting Mobile Nodes but we have not already
   investigated the particular issues that may arise in this case. Note
   that Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Extended Mode [12] proposes to handle
   this case, but may need additional features such as the ones proposed
   in this draft.

3. Why can't Mobile IPv6 support mobile networks ?

   In this section, we first review how the Mobile IP specifications
   deal with mobile networks. We then show the results of an
   experimentation we have conducted to outline Mobile IPv6's inability
   to support mobile networks.  Then we discuss why the existing Mobile
   IPv6 specification is unable to support mobile networks if the mobile
   router MR performs Mobile IPv6.

 3.1. Review of Mobile IP and Mobile Networks

      The Mobile IPv4 specification proposes to support mobile networks
      as standard mobile nodes (see [8] section 4.5, [9] section 5.12,
      [7] section 11.2). In this situation, the mobile node is the
      border router MR of the mobile network. It has a permanent home
      address on its home link and gets a new care-of address at each
      subsequent point of attachment.  As any mobile node, MR sends a
      Binding Update to its home agent HA to instruct it to intercept
      and tunnels packets to its care-of address.  The HA is therefore
      able to intercept packets destined to the home address of MR.

      In order to intercept packets intended to Stationary Nodes on the
      mobile network:

         o either the Home Agent may be configured to have a permanent
         registration for each Stationary Node that indicates the Mobile
         Router's address as the Stationary Node's care-of address.

         o either the mobile router may advertise connectivity to the
         entire mobile network using normal IP routing protocols.

      Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 with Routing Optimization [11] could
      actually support mobile networks similarly as in Mobile IPv4.
      However, although mentioned in the Mobile IPv4 specification, the
      current specifications of Mobile IPv4 with Routing Optimization
      and Mobile IPv6 don't mention them anymore.

 3.2. Experimentation

      The following sections describe an experimentation that shows that
      the existing Mobile IPv6 specification does not allow to route a
      packet from the fixed Internet to a Stationary Node on the mobile
      network.  This experimentation has been conducted on our IPv6 test
      bed using Francis Dupont "INRIA" IPv6 implementation under
      FreeBSD.

      As this is illustrated on figure 5, the Mobile Router MR has two
      interfaces.  The first is attached to the home link
      (3ffe:306:1130:100::/64) and is configured with the home address
      (3ffe:306:1130:100::eui64).  The second interface is on the Mobile
      Network (3ffe:306:1130:200::/64).

      The Mobile Router MR performs Mobile IPv6. The mobile network
      moves and attaches to the foreign link (3ffe:306:5555:7777::/64).
      In a first experiment, a Correspondent Node CN in the fixed
      Internet sends a ping packet to MR.  In a second experiment, the
      CN sends a packet to SN1, a Stationary Node on the mobile network.

  3.2.2.  Registration with the Home Agent

      MR obtains a care-of address on the foreign link and registers its
      primary care-of address with its Home Agent HA.  Once it receives
      a valid Binding Update, HA records in its Binding Cache the
      binding between the home address of the sender and its care-of
      address.  The home address is used as the key for searching the
      Binding Cache ([4] section 4.6). In order to intercept packets, HA
      claims it is the MR.  This is performed by the way of a
      "gratuitous" Neighbor Advertisement message on behalf of the
      mobile node (i.e. MR), as described in section 9.5 of the Mobile
      IPv6 specification.

      More precisely, when it receives a home registration from MR, the
      HA:

         o opens a NDP proxy to intercept packets addressed to the home
         address of MR.

         o opens a tug (a virtual interface, i.e. IPv6 in IPv6 tunnel)
         between the care-of address of MR and itself.

         o adds a host-specific route (a route to a host, not to a
         prefix) for the home address of MR via its care-of address
         through the tug.

  3.2.3. First experiment: Communication between CN and MR

      CN sends a ping packet to MR's home address
      (3ffe:306:1130:100::eui64).  When the packet gets to the home
      network, BR sends NDP messages to discover the MAC address of MR.
      HA answers with its address on behalf of MR. The packet gets
      routed to the HA. In the standard IPv6 input function of the HA,
      the packet is routed through the tug, i.e. tunneled to MR's care-
      of address.

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6      22 June 2001


  3.2.4. Second experiment: Communication between CN and SN1

      CN sends a ping packet to node SN1's IP address
      (3ffe:306:1130:200::eui64). When the packet gets to the home
      network, BR checks its routing table to reach SN1. BR has a route
      to the mobile network; MR's home address is the next hop towards
      SN1. BR sends NDP messages to discover the MAC address of MR. HA
      answers with its address on behalf of the MR. The HA intercepts
      the packet, but does not have a route to the mobile network. So it
      sends the ping packet to its default route (i.e. the BR) wich
      forward it again to the HA. THE PING PACKET ENTERS A ROUTING LOOP
      UNTIL THE TTL EXPIRES.

 3.3. Discussion

      We see that obtaining a care-of address and requesting the HA to
      redirect incoming packets intended for the MR doesn't require

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6      22 June 2001


      modifications in the Mobile IPv6 specification as this could be
      done independently for a host or for a router.  As a result,
      packets destined to the MR are correctly intercepted by the HA and
      tunneled to the MR.

      However, although the HA is able to intercept datagrams intended
      to the Stationary Nodes on the mobile network, it is unable to
      encapsulate them to the care-of address of the MR because it does
      not have a route to the mobile network.  The MR registration only
      tells the HA to record a host-specific route in its routing table.
      A network route for the mobile network prefix (prefix of the
      second interface of MR) via the care-of address of MR is missing.

      Indeed, some other implementations of the Mobile IPv6
      specification interpret the behavior of the Home Agent in face of
      a Mobile Router registration.  In such implementation, the HA may
      have a network route for the mobile network via the care-of
      address of the MR.  We advocate that such implementations do not
      strictly follow the Mobile IPv6 specification and may probably not
      complain with it.  Leaving too much room for interpretation surely
      leads to misinterpretation and pitfalls, not to say security
      holes.  Then, this lack should at least be clarified in an updated
      version of the Mobile IPv6 specification.

 3.4. Conclusion

      Since the HA is unable to redirect packets intended to the
      Stationary nodes and CNs don't have an entry in their Binding
      Cache to route packets directly to the Stationary Nodes, no
      communication at all is possible between CNs and the Stationary
      Nodes.

      We conclude that the Mobile IPv6 specification needs:

         o to be at least explicitly clarified in order for the HA to
         redirect all packets intended to the mobile network, but
         extensions are more likely needed.

         o to be extended in order to transmit packets from the CN to
         the Stationary Nodes by the most optimal route.

4. Mobile IPv6 extensions to support mobile networks

 4.0. Overview

   According to the observations made in section 3.2.4, we propose to
   extend Mobile IPv6 with "Prefix Scope Binding Updates".  Instead of
   establishing a one-to-one relationship between a home address and a



Ernst & Bellier         Expires 22 December 2001               [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6      22 June 2001


   care-of-address, the binding establishes a many-to-one relationship
   between the set of nodes that share the same mobile network prefix
   and a care-of-address.  Prefix Scope Binding Updates are Binding
   Updates that associate a care-of address with the mobile network
   prefix instead of the full 128-bits IPv6 home address.  The mobile
   network prefix is used as a netmask in the Binding Cache.

   The Mobile Router sends Prefix Scope Binding Updates containing both
   its care-of address and the mobile network prefix to all the
   Correspondent Nodes that communicate with itself or any Stationary
   Node on the mobile network it is serving.  The Prefix Scope Binding
   Update instructs its recipients to use the care-of address of the
   Mobile Router for all packets which destination address corresponds
   to the mobile network prefix.

   As a result, a sole copy of the Prefix Scope Binding Update allows
   optimal routing between a CN and any Stationary Node on the same
   mobile network.

   The mobile network prefix is carried in a new Sub-Option and requires
   a new flag in the Mobile IPv6 Binding Update Option. The procedure
   for searching the Binding Cache is slightly modified.

 4.1. Packet Format of the Binding Update

      We propose to extend the Mobile IPv6 Binding Update Option with an
      extra flag "Prefix Scope Registration" (P) taken from the
      "Reserved" field.  In addition, the "Mobile Network Prefix" is a
      new sub-option that contains the mobile network prefix.

  4.1.1. New Binding Update Option format

         The Binding Update option is encoded in type-length-value (TLV)
         format as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

         Prefix Scope Registration (P)

            When set, it indicates that the sending mobile node attempts
            to register a care-of address for an entire network.  It
            also requests the receiving node to process the Mobile
            Network Prefix Sub-Option and to re-route packets with a
            destination address that corresponds to the Mobile Network
            Prefix.

         Rsrvd

            This field is reduced from a 4-bit field to a 3-bit field to
            account for the addition of the "Prefix Scope Registration"
            bit.  The remaining 3 bits are unused and MUST be
            initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
            receiver.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


         The Mobile Network Prefix is filled by the sending mobile node
         to request the receiving node to record a Prefix Scope entry in
         the Binding Cache (see section 4.2).

         The Prefix Length field is set to the (nonzero) length of the
         mobile network prefix.

         The Mobile Network Prefix field is set to the prefix of the
         mobile network.

 4.2. Cache Management

  4.2.1. Binding Cache entries

         Each Binding Cache entry contains the same fields as defined in
         [4]. A new "Prefix Scope Registration" flag is added:

             - a flag "Prefix Scope Registration" (P) indicating whether



Ernst & Bellier         Expires 22 December 2001               [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6      22 June 2001


            or not this Binding Cache entry represents a mobile network
            served by a mobile router whose prefix is recorded in the
            "Home Address" field.

            - the value of the "Prefix Length" field received in the
            Binding Update that created or last modified this Binding
            Cache entry.  This field is only valid if the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" flag or the "Home Registration" flag is set on
            this Binding Cache entry.  If the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" flag is set, the "Prefix Length corresponds to
            the length of the mobile network prefix, otherwise the
            meaning is as defined in [4].

            - if the "Prefix Scope Registration" (P) flag is set, the
            "home address" field is filled with the mobile network
            prefix.

  4.2.2. Searching the Binding Cache entries

         The Binding Cache is searched for an entry corresponding to the
         destination address of the packet.  The destination address is
         compared with the home address field of entries recorded in the
         Binding Cache.

         If the "Prefix Scope Registration" flag is set in the entry
         under comparison, the comparison is made between the "Prefix
         Length" set of initial bits of the destination address and the
         "home address" field.  If the prefix of the destination matches
         the mobile network prefix recorded in the entry, the
         destination is located in a mobile network.

         If the "Prefix Scope Registration" flag is not set, the
         comparison is made on the 128-bits addresses. If the
         destination address matches the home address, the destination
         is a mobile node.

         In both case, the care-of address of the corresponding entry is
         returned.

 4.3.  Extended Mobile IPv6 protocol operation

      The Mobile Node operation is extended to set the (P) bit to 1 and
      to fill the Mobile Network Prefix Sub-Option when it is a Mobile
      Router that serves as the gateway of a mobile network.  It is also
      extended to send Binding Updates to all CNs that communicate with
      any Stationary Node on the mobile network.

      The Correspondent Node and the Home Agent operations are extended



Ernst & Bellier         Expires 22 December 2001               [Page 15]

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6      22 June 2001


      to process Mobile Network Prefix Sub-Option and to transmit
      packets to the care-of address of the Mobile Router.  The Mobile
      Network Prefix Sub-Option is processed if the (P) bit from the
      Binding Update Option is set.  Packets are transmitted to the
      care-of address of the Mobile Router if the destination address
      matches the Mobile Network Prefix.

      The following sections only describe changes according to sections
      8, 9 and 10 of the Mobile IPv6 specification [4].

  4.3.1. Correspondent Node Operation

         Receiving (Prefix Scope) Binding Updates

            Upon receiving a Binding Update, the CN performs validity
            checks as described in [4] section 8.2.  In addition, if the
            "Prefix Scope Registration" (P) bit in the Binding Update
            Option is set, the CN received a Binding Update from a
            Mobile Router serving a mobile network. The Mobile Network
            Prefix Sub-Option MUST be ignored if the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" (P) bit from the Binding Update Option is not
            set.

            If the Binding Update is valid, the CN creates a new entry
            in its Binding Cache for this mobile node.  This is
            performed as described in [4].

            In addition, if the (P) bit is set, the CN creates a second
            Binding Cache entry similar to the first one and copies in
            the Binding Cache entry the "Prefix Scope Registration" bit
            from the Binding Update Option, the "Prefix Length" field
            from the Mobile Network Prefix Sub-Option. The "Home
            Address" field in the Binding Cache is filled from the
            Mobile Network Prefix" field in the Mobile Network Prefix
            Sub-Option.

            Figure 6 shows the content of the Binding Cache.

         Sending Packets

            Before sending any packet, the sending node examines its
            Binding Cache for an entry for the destination address to
            which the packet is being sent (see section 4.2.2 "Searching
            the Binding Cache").  If the sending node has a Binding
            Cache entry, the sending node uses a routing header to route
            the packet to the destination node via the returned care-of
            address.

  4.3.2. Home Agent Operation

         Primary care-of address registration

            Upon receiving a Binding Update, the HA performs validity
            checks as described in [4] section 9.3.  In addition, if the
            "Prefix Scope Registration" (P) bit in the Binding Update
            Option is set, the HA received a Binding Update from a
            Mobile Router serving a mobile network. The Mobile Network
            Prefix Sub-Option MUST be ignored if the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" (P) bit from the Binding Update Option is not
            set.

            If the Binding Update is valid, the HA creates a new entry
            in its Binding Cache for this mobile node as it is performed
            in [4].

            In addition, if the (P) bit is set, the sending node is a
            Mobile Router and the HA creates a second Binding Cache
            entry similar to the first one and copies the "Prefix Scope
            Registration" bit from the Binding Update Option, the
            "Prefix Length" field from the Mobile Network Prefix Sub-
            Option. The "Home Address" field in the Binding Cache is
            filled from the Mobile Network Prefix" field in the Mobile
            Network Prefix Sub-Option.

            Figure 6 shows the content of the Binding Cache.

         Intercepting Packets

            Datagrams sent by the CN to the IP address of the Stationary
            Node are routed towards the home link of the mobile router
            where they are intercepted by the HA as specified in [4]
            section 9.5.

         Tunneling Intercepted Packets to a Mobile Node

            For any packet sent to a mobile node or a Stationary Node
            for which the Home Agent is the original sender of the
            packet, the Home Agent is operating as a Correspondent Node
            and the procedures described in section 4.3.2 applies.

            While acting as a Home Agent, the Home Agent intercepts any
            packet on the home link addressed to a mobile node or to a
            Stationary Node. The Home Agent examines its Binding Cache
            for an entry for the destination address to which the packet
            is being sent (see section 4.2.2 "Searching the Binding
            Cache").  If the sending node has a Binding Cache entry, the

            Home Agent tunnels the packet to the care-of address
            recorded in that Binding Cache entry.

  4.3.3. Mobile Router Operation

         Obtaining a care-of address

            Similarly to a standard mobile node as defined in the Mobile
            IPv6 specification [4], the Mobile Router obtains a new
            care-of address at each of its subsequent points of
            attachment using either stateless or stateful DHCPv6 address
            configuration.

         Receiving encapsulated packets from the Home Agent

            The Mobile Router may receive packet encapsulated to its
            care-of address.  Those packets may indeed be intended to
            the Mobile Router itself or to any MNN served by the Mobile
            Router. The reception of an encapsulated packet tunneled
            from the Mobile Router's Home Agent is an indication that
            the original sender may not have a Binding Cache entry for
            the Mobile Network Prefix. In this case, the Mobile Router
            may deduce that a Prefix Scope Binding Update should be sent
            to the original sender of the packet.

         Sending Prefix Scope Binding Updates

            A Mobile Router serving as a gateway to a mobile network
            sends Prefix Scope Binding Update datagrams to its Home
            Agent, its own CNs, and CNs of the Stationary Nodes it is
            serving.  Prefix Scope Binding Updates are sent as specified
            in [4] section 10.6 and 10.8 and the Binding List is filled
            accordingly.  In addition, the Mobile Router sets the
            "Prefix Scope Registration" bit in the Binding Update Option
            and inserts a Mobile Network Sub-Option.  The "Prefix
            Length" and the "Mobile Network Prefix" fields are filled
            according to the Mobile Network Prefix owned by the Mobile
            Router.

         Bypassing ingress filtering

            In order to bypass ingress filtering, the Mobile Router may
            encapsulate all outgoing packets to the destination with its
            care-of address as the outer source address.

5. Security Issues

 5.1. Authentication

      The registration of the Mobile Router's care-of address for a set
      of nodes that share the same network prefix (Mobile Network
      Prefix) does not break authentication and does not differ from the
      standard Mobile IPv6 registration for a mobile node.  In Mobile
      IPv6, the Mobile Node is authenticated by the CN based on its home
      address, whatever the content of the Binding Update. Similarly,
      nothing breaks the authentication of the sender of a Prefix Scope
      Binding Update.  The Mobile Router operates as a standard Mobile
      Node and has a home address. Authentication is still based on this
      home address.  Recipients of the prefix scope Binding Updates are
      not misled about the identity of the sender. The mobile router is
      clearly authenticated by its HA and CNs whatever is contained in

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6      22 June 2001


      the Binding Update.

 5.2. Authorization

      Recent discussion in the mailing list and IETF meetings have
      advocated a need to extend Mobile IPv6 with authorization.  In the
      standard Mobile IPv6, the Mobile Node is authenticated by its HA
      and CNs but those have no guarantee that the Mobile Node is
      allowed to send a Binding Update for the home address specified in
      the Binding Update.  Indeed, the Mobile IPv6 policy is to accept
      whatever is being carried in the Binding Update as long as the
      sender is authenticated.

      A Mobile Router willing to send Prefix Scope Binding Updates faces
      the same authorization issue.  In addition, a means is required to
      authorize a Mobile Router to register a binding between the Mobile
      Network Prefix and its care-of address.  In other words, we need a
      means to certify that the Mobile Router actually serves the Mobile
      Network Prefix.

  5.2.1. How to certify that the MR owns the prefix

         Proposals [14,15,16] that require the participation of the Home
         Agent to authorize a Mobile Node are suitable to operate with
         Mobile Routers as well.  We consider only BAKE [16] in the
         following since it appears to be the most advanced submission
         as well as the one that introduces the less computational
         overhead. The very aim of BAKE is to distribute keys between a
         Mobile Node and a Correspondent Node, making the CN aware that
         the MN has actually the right to send a Binding Update for a
         specific Home Address.  Prior to sending the Binding Update,
         three new messages are supposed to be exchanged within that
         proposal:

            o Binding Warning (MN --> CN)

            o Binding Request (CN --> HA & HA --> MN)

            o Binding Key Establishment (MN --> CN)

         This kind of messaging (involving the Home Agent to check
         whether the Mobile Node can be reached at the Home Address it
         provided) can be reused with a Mobile Router.  A few
         modifications are however required to make BAKE support Mobile
         Networks.  Basically, the authorization mechanism should be
         extended so that is supports a Binding Update for a prefix.
         Obviously, we must avoid a situation where any node served by
         the Mobile Router would be able to send a Prefix Scope Binding



Ernst & Bellier         Expires 22 December 2001               [Page 20]

INTERNET-DRAFT  Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6      22 June 2001


         Update instead of the Mobile Router.

         To do so, the easiest way would be to add a flag to the Binding
         Request message, telling the HA that the Binding Warning the CN
         just received was sent by a Mobile Router (at least claiming to
         be one). The HA would then have to check whether this claim is
         true; according to the result of this check, the Binding
         Request would be either silently discarded or would be
         forwarded to the Mobile Router.

  5.2.2. Assumptions concerning the Home Agent

         The HA MUST be aware that the Mobile Router is not a basic host
         but actually a Router.  The HA MUST know the Mobile Network
         Prefix served by the Mobile Router.

         A means MUST be given to the Mobile Router to make it able to
         securely (i.e. being both authenticated and authorized) send a
         Binding Update to its HA, thus updating the HA binding cache
         prior to initiating BAKE procedure (in case of BAKE
         implementation).
