Abstract

   The architecture of Sender ID follows from a set of design
   decisions.  Those decisions were motivated by philosophical,
   engineering, and political considerations.  This document reviews
   some of the important choice that distinguish Sender ID from
   alternative possibilities in the same space.

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The Aspen Framework
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sender ID fits into a larger framework which was devised at a
 conference held at the Aspen Institute in December 2003.  That
 framework has these parts:

 1) authentication
 2) accreditation
 3) reputation

 Authentication tries to answer the question: "How confident can a 
 receiver be that an email message really is from who it claims to be 
 from?"  It counters forgery and fraud.

 Accreditation lets third parties vouch for senders with whom they have 
 a prior relationship.

 Reputation systems help receivers decide the disposition of incoming 
 messages.  Reputation systems rate senders and their accreditors.

 Receivers may develop local reputation systems, employ third party 
 reputation services, trust certain accreditors directly, or do all of 
 the above.

 The absence of prior trust between arbitrary senders and receivers 
 implies a potentially skeptical relationship between accreditation and 
 reputation services.

 This framework resonates with real-world models of human interaction.
 For example, reputation services exist today in the form of credit 
 bureaus and movie reviews.  Accreditation services exist today in the 
 form of passports and university diplomas.

 Sender ID directly enables authentication and accreditation, and 
 indirectly supports reputation technologies.

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Two Cultures Of Authentication
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sender ID provides syntax and semantics that help answer the
 authentication question: "How confident can a receiver be that an
 email message really is from who it claims to be from?"  But there are
 at least two ways to ask and answer the question.

 In a designated sender scheme, the question becomes: "is the SMTP
 client of an incoming message authorized by the purported sender of
 that message to send the message?"  The primary identity is the sender
 of the message --- the (administratively independent) entity
 responsible for the most recent injection of the message into the
 mailstream.

 Designated sender schemes consider the channels  through which a 
 message is transported.  They do not consider the content of the 
 message.  In a store-and-forward model of email, designated sender 
 schemes apply to hops between administratively independent domains.

 In a cryptographic scheme, the question becomes: "do the credentials 
 embedded in the message validate its purported authorship, according to 
 a public-key cryptosystem?"  The primary identity is the author of the 
 message --- the entity which created the content.

 Cryptographic schemes consider the content of a message.  They do not 
 consider the means by which it was delivered.  Cryptographic schemes 
 are congruent with an end-to-end model of email.

 Note that designated sender schemes are generally better suited to 
 identifying senders and cryptographic schemes are better suited to 
 identifying authorsship. 

 Sender ID defines mechanisms that implement a designated sender scheme.  
 Sender ID can also be extended to describe cryptographic schemes.

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004



----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Architectural Considerations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The greatest virtue of Internet email is openness.  Open systems suffer 
 the problem of abuse.  Sender ID tries to curtail domain spoofing as 
 much as possible  while encroaching upon virtues as little as 
 possible.  It does this by aiming for mechanism, not policy.

 A number of competing requirements inform the design.  On the one hand, 
 position A is valid; on the other, so is position B.

   - Zombies versus hobbyists.
   - Spam folders versus SMTP rejects.
   - Rejecting before DATA vs rejecting after DATA.
   - 100% backward compatibility versus an unacceptable status quo.
   - Nipping the innocent in the bud.
   - Inconveniencing non-participants.
   - The perfect is the enemy of the good.
   - There is no such thing as an interim standard.
   - This is a job for sysadmins.
   - DNS: Caching versus parsing.
   - DNS: speed vs expressiveness.
   - DNS: ease of writing vs ease of reading.
   - DNS: use of XML vs development of a little language.


 Zombies versus hobbyists:

  A - A majority of spam today originates from end-user machines
      infected by viruses that send spam directly to receivers' MX
      servers.  Such zombies should no longer be able to send
      direct-to-mx spam.

  B - Linux hobbyists should still be able to send mail from their
      consumer-grade broadband connections.  They may have no control
      over the PTR records of their assigned IP addresses, but the
      concept of first-class and second-class citizenship rankles many
      idealists who believe in an unfettered end-to-end model of pure
      IP connectivity.

 Spam folders versus SMTP rejects:

  A - Rejecting messages at SMTP time is too abrupt.  Filing to a
      spam folder is better; that way, recipients have a chance to pull
      false positives back from the brink without embarrassment.



Wong                                                      [Page 05]

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


  B - Filing to a spam folder often means nobody sees a message, and
      false positives silently disappear.  If a sender receives no
      notification that a message was lost, the integrity of the email
      system suffers.

 Rejecting before DATA vs rejecting after DATA.

  A - If the protocol makes spoofs rejectable before DATA, we save
      bandwidth.  We can even honour per-user policies.

  B - If the protocol rejects spoofs only after the message DATA has
      been received, we have the opportunity to review the message
      content in greater detail.

 100% backward compatibility versus an unacceptable status quo:

  A - the Old Email is broken in many ways, and spam will continue to
      be a problem until it is fixed.

  B - the New Email should be 100% backward compatible with the Old
      Email, and nobody should have to change anything for the New
      Email to work.

 Nipping the innocent in the bud:

  A - Spam should be stopped before it starts; to limit the cost of a
      spam attack, receivers should by default adopt a skeptical stance
      to any unknown input.  In big cities, people don't talk to
      strangers.

  B - In small towns, people smile at strangers.  Senders should be
      assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Any person should be able
      to get onto the Internet, register a domain, and immediately
      email a hundred of his closest friends.

 Inconveniencing non-participants:

  A - The designated sender model works correctly for the vast majority
      of all mail, which is sent directly from sender to recipient.  In
      its strong form, Sender ID permits rejection of unwanted mail
      before the DATA command; this represents a significant bandwidth
      savings.

      Under the designated sender model, the strategy that minimizes
      the global amount of work requires non-conformant sites
      (primarily, forwarders and web-generated emailers) to work toward
      conformance (ie. Pre-pending headers and adding SUBMITTER
      support


Wong                                                      [Page 06]

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004



  B - Forwarders and web-generated emailers are merely operating
      according to time-honoured traditions.  Sender ID changes the
      terms of their unwritten contract; it is unfair to demand that
      they change.  Placing the good of the many above the good of the
      few can lead to a tyranny of the majority.


 The perfect is the enemy of the good:

  A - people who are losing money every day due to spam want the New
      Email to be done quickly.

  B - people who worry about the overall architectural integrity of the
      Internet want the New Email to be done right, even if that takes
      longer.

 There is no such thing as an interim standard:

  A - it is important to experiment with new protocols on a large scale
      before officially blessing anything.

  B - there is no such thing as an "interim" standard: anything that
      rolls out at all will be there forever.

      Perhaps this conflict can be solved by moving to a "controlled
      burn" model of change management on the Internet.

 This is a job for sysadmins:

  A - the New Email should be fully transparent to the end-user and
      require no reconfiguration.

  B - no disagreement!

 DNS: Caching versus parsing.

  A - To reduce the burden on clients, records should be easily cached.
      Records that describe the full set of designated senders up front
      are easily cached and require no subsequent lookups.  However,
      such records require parsing.

  B - To reduce the burden on clients, records should require minimal
      parsing.  Records that answer "yes/no" for a given query aganst a
      domain/IP tuple can be easily parsed using existing DNSBL logic.
      However, such records are not easily cached, particularly when a
      wide range of IP addresses produce multiple negative results.

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


 DNS: speed vs expressiveness.

  A - The protocol should minimize the number of DNS queries needed,
      particularly serial queries.  This reduces start-to-finish time.

  B - The protocol should be rich and expressive, even if that means
      multiple lookups are needed to resolve an answer.  This increases
      start-to-finish time.

 DNS: ease of writing vs ease of reading

  A - it should be easy for senders to publish records.  Maybe senders
      should describe their designated sender policies in a high-level
      form and leave correct interpretation up to the receivers.  If
      they change an MX server's IP address, Sender ID should be smart
      enough to do the right thing automatically.  The whole point of
      the DNS is to map symbolic names to lower-level data.
      Unnecessary redundancy is undesirable.

  B - It should be easy for receivers to query records.  Maybe senders
      should be expected to precompile designated sender information
      into a canonical form.  Every time an MX server changes its IP
      address, it's the sender's job to remember to republish the
      designated sender data.

 DNS: use of XML vs development of a little language

  A - The syntax should be easy for receivers to implement.  The
      adoption of existing data formats such as XML means that existing
      libraries can be used to parse the data.  XML is popular among
      the Microsoft community.

  B - The syntax should be easy for receivers to implement.  The use of
      a custom-made little language means that heavyweight XML
      libraries are not required.  XML is generally unpopular among the
      open community.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Design Goals and Guidelines
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 This section discusses a way to broadly measure the success of the
 project.  It also lays out the design philosophy which guides
 decision-making.


 * Market-based metrics.

 Sender ID is not the only specification to take aim at the problem of 
 authentication.  Other designs reflect different goals.  Some designs 
 are within the LMAP family (eg. DMP, RMX).  Other designs are not 
 (Call-Back Verification, Challenge/Response).

 With a variety of designs on the market, the success of this effort can 
 be measured by relative market share; how many domains publish Sender 
 ID records, and how many receivers check them?


 * The Fax Effect

 The value to a domain of adopting the standard depends, in part, on the 
 number of other domains who have already adopted the standard.

 This is commonly called the fax effect: the first two people to buy a 
 fax machine could only use it to communicate with each other, but every 
 subsequent adopter could use it to communicate with everybody else who 
 already had one.  Today, faxes are everywhere.

 Sender ID represents a major shift in the paradigm of email.  For the 
 fax effect to fully manifest, a significant majority of legitimate 
 email on the Internet should be covered by Sender ID.

4.1 Design Goals

 The design goals follow logically.











Wong                                                      [Page 09]

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004



4.1.1 Fast widespread adoption.

 To get the fax effect on our side quickly, we want to make it possible 
 for people to quickly and easily adopt the standard.

 On the publishing end, this meant that the syntax and semantics must be 
 easily learned by busy people whose level of DNS technological savvy we 
 could not take for granted.  Alternatively, a wizard can help them set 
 up records which they can treat as opaque.

 On the receiving end, this meant that the standard should be reasonably 
 straightforward to implement for the most popular MTAs.

 There are many more sender domains than receiving MTA implementors.
 Therefore, the design should optimize for ease of publishing over ease 
 of implementation.


4.1.2 Minimizing friction.

 Even the least amount of friction will impede adoption.  The Design 
 should take advantage of existing capabilities wherever possible.  The 
 design should optimize for the path of least resistance.  The less 
 overhead needed to publish a record, the better.


4.2 Design Guidelines

 The design guidelines that result from the above goals are:

4.2.1: optimize for ease of publishing over ease of implementation.

4.2.2: follow the path of least resistance.

4.2.3: Find a middle way by setting mechanism, not policy.

 Where design alternatives appear to conflict, find a
 technical compromise that lets each school operate; do
 not mandate or prohibit any of the choices.

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Life Cycle Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The designed protocol is a thing that does not stand in isolation, but 
 moves through a life cycle; to be successful, it must be pass both 
 economic and marketing muster at each stage in its life.

 Cautious people will want to transition gradually toward full 
 acceptance of Sender ID.  Therefore Sender ID cannot be designed with 
 only on/off states; it should have a transitional adoption strategy.

 Over-specifying the protocol leads to untimely ossification.
 Under-specifying the protocol leads to a lack of expressiveness.
 The solution to both over-specification and under-specification is to 
 ensure extensibility.  Extensibility should be well defined on both 
 syntactic and semantic levels.

 A well-designed protocol often finds itself being legitimately used in 
 ways the original designers did not anticipate.  Unexpected uses 
 validate the expression model.  To date, a number of unexpected uses 
 have arisen: for example, use of the "exists" mechanism to perform 
 basic logging.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Choices reflected in Sender ID's Architecture
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Given the above architectural considerations, design goals, and
 design guidelines, Sender ID makes a number of choices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1. Identity
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Authentication schemes can focus on a number of identities.

 The simplest schemes ask if the IP address of the SMTP client should be 
 permitted to send mail or not.

 More complex designated sender schemes add a domain-name dimension.
 They ask if the IP address is permitted to send mail *for that domain*.







Wong                                                      [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004






6.1.1. Am I MTA or Not?

 The simplest scheme asks a network owner if a given IP address is 
 allowed to send mail to the public Internet.  Instances of this scheme
 include:

   - .mxout.
   - MTAMark
   - Selective Sender

 Such schemes generally store the permission information in the PTR 
 tree, alongside it, or in a parallel domain tree.

 These schemes make the "zombies versus hobbyists" tradeoff in favour of 
 blocking zombies.  If we assume that a hobbyist has no control over 
 their PTR record, and will have no control over their 
 MTAMark/SS/.mxout. record either, these schemes disenfranchise 
 hobbyists.

 In accordance with its "mechanism, not policy" design philosophy, 
 Sender ID makes the "zombies versus hobbyists" tradeoff in favour of 
 hobbyists who are assumed to control the forward DNS of a domain they 
 own.  The important thing is to establish accountability: if a spammer 
 wishes to designate a zombie as a permitted sender, the message is 
 Sender ID conformant; it is the responsibility of the reputation system 
 to reject the message.


6.1.2. Am I an MTA for the HELO domain?

 The next simplest scheme asks the domain of the HELO command if the IP 
 address is a permitted sender for that domain.

   - DRIP
   - CSV

 Authenticating the HELO identity is useful for whitelisting by MTA 
 hostname.

 Reputation services could evaluate relays  identified in the HELO 
 domain.





Wong                                                      [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


6.1.3. Am I an MTA for the MAIL FROM domain?

 Schemes that ask this question include:

   - DMP
   - RMX
   - FSV
   - DVP
   - SPF

 DMP allows the HELO domain to override the MAIL FROM.

 SPF uses the HELO domain only when the MAIL FROM is null.


 Using the MAIL FROM address is considered useful for fighting joe-job 
 bounce blowback, but it has the disadvantage of requiring forwarders to 
 use some sort of return-path rewriting scheme and thereby become 
 transport remailers.  Paul Vixie alluded to this in his 2002 paper.


6.1.4. Am I an MTA for the responsible sender according to the 2822 headers?

 It is useful to use Designated Sender techniques to validate sender 
 information seen in the MUA.  If conforming mailers prepend an 
 appropriate header to indicate a relay hop, MUAs can extract a 
 Purported Responsible Address (PRA) from the headers and display that 
 information.

 The SUBMITTER parameter to MAIL FROM is a preview of the Purported 
 Responsible Address from the 2822 headers.

 If present, it overrides MAIL FROM.

 Using 2822 sender information is considered useful for fighting 
 phishing.

 However, it requires that MUAs display both author and sender 
 information.  Outlook already does this, with "from X on behalf of Y".
 Other MUAs who wanted to use the benefits of 2822 Sender ID 
 authentication would have to also display "from X via Y" information.

 If a message was forwarded through multiple hops, it may be necessary 
 to display "from X via Y via Z".

 In the simple legitimate case, the Purported Responsible Address would 
 be the "From" header, and there would be no "Sender" or "Resent-From"
 type headers.  MUAs might be able to mark mail from certain domains 


Wong                                                      [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


 with a "trusted" hint.  In a phishing attempt, spoofs would lack the 
 "trusted" hint.  The "trusted" hint would also be missing in a message 
 sent through a forwarding system, but presumably the end-user would 
 know what messages were forwarded, and adjust their expectations 
 accordingly.




6.1.5. Why use SUBMITTER instead of the HELO name?


 Promoting the Purported Responsible Address into the MAIL command 
 provides two benefits: it makes it possible to reject spoofs before 
 DATA, and it potentially makes adoption easier for forwarders.

 The HELO name may still be authenticated using an SPF check; however, 
 it is not the subject of this document.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2. Per User Lookups
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Doing per-user lookups reduces cacheability but increases granularity.

 Per-user lookups can be supported all of the time, some of the time, or 
 none of the time.

 Sender ID chooses to support per-user lookups some of the time using 
 the "exists" mechanism, with the expectation  that only low volume 
 senders will use this feature; therefore the burden on DNS is believed 
 to be acceptable.




----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3. Response Codes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The simplest scheme has only two response codes: good or bad.

 More complex schemes expand the set of responses to good, bad, and 
 unknown.

 In response to criticism from Steve Bellovin , Sender ID provides a 
 range of seven response codes.



Wong                                                      [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


   "Error" and "Unknown" correspond to temporary and permanent failures.  

   "Neutral" indicates the queried domain explicitly wishes to pretend
   it does not publish Sender ID records.

   "None" indicates the queried domain does not, in fact, publish
   Sender ID records.

   "Pass" means the administrator of the sender's domain states that the 
   message comes from an IP address assigned to one of that domain's 
   authorized outbound e-mail servers.

   "Fail" means the administrator of the sender's domain states that the 
   IP address from which the message was received is not assigned to one 
   of that domain's authorized outbound e-mail servers.

   "Softfail" indicates a transitional state: while not as strong as
   "fail", it means the administrator of the sender's domain states
   that the IP address from which the message was received is not
   assigned to one of that domain's authorized outbound e-mail servers,
   however, the message may still be legitimate.  Receivers should
   treat it with skepticism.  This has significance for spam scoring
   systems.  The adoption path is greatly smoothed by the presence of
   "softfail" as a standard result code.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4. Block or Factored 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 In a purely block-style protocol, published records completely describe 
 the sets of designated senders.  Receivers are expected to figure 
 everything out based on those records.  Receivers only need to fetch 
 information from senders the first time a query occurs; subsequent 
 fetches can be retrieved from the DNS resolver cache or from a nearer 
 application cache.

 In a purely factored-style protocol, receivers include pertinent 
 information in the DNS query; sender servers are expected to return a 
 response based on those inputs.  While the parsing burden tends to be 
 lower with factored-style protocols, receivers need to perform a DNS 
 lookup for each new IP client for that domain.

 Large receiving sites tend to prefer the block style because it avoids 
 repeated lookups; for efficiency they can also transform the block 
 records into an internal representation that is locally cached and 
 distributed.

Internet-Draft           Sender ID Rationale            Jun 23 2004


 Specifications which use purely factored-style records are not 
 transformable.  They include MTAMark, SS, DVP, and DMP.

 Specifications which use purely block-style records are fully 
 transformable.  They include Caller-ID and RMX.

 FSV offers both block and factored record styles.

 Sender ID is largely a block-style protocol but provides for factored 
 lookups using the "exists" mechanism.  Sender ID is therefore partly 
 transformable.  Publishing domains which refrain from using "ptr", 
 "exists", and per-user macros can be cached.  Most high-volume senders 
 are expected to publish data in IP-only notation as a courtesy to 
 receivers.  Noncacheable mechanisms are therefore expected to be used 
 only by smaller sites.  This is considered an acceptable tradeoff.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.5. Set-theoretic or Procedural
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Block-style declarations can be further expressed in two ways:
 set-theoretic or procedural.

 In a set-theoretic scheme, publishers explicitly partition the input 
 space into result codes.  Receivers locate the input tuple in that 
 space and return the result.

 In a procedural scheme, publishers provide an ordered list of 
 mechanisms which are evaluated sequentially.  The first mechanism to 
 match determines the result.

 With the exception of the "exists" mechanism, the procedural scheme can 
 be mapped to a set-theoretic representation.  The two schemes are 
 therefore isomorphic except when "exists" is used.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.6. Record Type
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Several alternatives are possible:

 * new, custom RR type.
 * TXT record.
 * record with underscore subdomain.

 The record type is still being decided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.7. Record Syntax
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Two alternatives include:

 * Ad-hoc SPF notation
 * XML

 Receiver systems should not have trouble supporting both using a "two
 parsers, one interpreter" model.  The ad-hoc SPF notation has been
 specified and field-tested, and is not expected to change.  The XML
 representation is presented in the marid-core document.  Sender ID
 will be compatible with both.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Business Analyses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Where deployment and adoption are concerned, business and marketing
 considerations are as important as technical considerations.

7.1. Economic Analysis: Market failure and collective action

 To successfully deploy, the New Email requires significant resource
 allocation: at the minimum, it needs implementation labour,
 interoperability testing, and a big, expensive, PR campaign.  Given
 the amount of work that needs to be done, a single organization is
 unlikely to create a pure public good at its own expense.  On the
 multinational Internet, this is as true when the organization is a
 corporation as when the organization is a state.  The technical name
 for this problem "market failure", though it encompasses the absence
 of government provision as well.

 Intellectual property rights over the developed standard are one way
 out of the market failure problem.  However, the public's distaste for
 kingmaking reduces the chances of successful adoption of any licensed
 technology.

 Economically speaking, market failure in this case is solved by 
 collective action by major ISPs.  A mechanism that reduces the existing 
 cost of imperfect spam filtering will be adopted and evangelized by 
 ISPs who bear that cost.

7.2. Marketing Analysis: Chasm Theory

 The designed product, and the augmentations that surround it, must 
 survive each phase of Geoffrey Moore's Chasm model.

 The core specification should be attractive enough to the visionaries 
 to seed the fax effect by publishing records and writing libraries.

 After an initial round of discovery and experimentation by the early 
 adopters, the mainstream must be encouraged to start publishing 
 records.  This is the first chasm, on the publishing side.  They need 
 the assurance that publishing records will, first, do no harm.

 The beachhead for crossing the publishing-side chasm turned out to be 
 industry leaders.  When enough well known domains published records, 
 they seeded the second round of the fax effect.  The second round turns 
 potential receiver-side implementors into actual implementors:
 the early adopters here are the makers of antispam email appliances and 
 edge MTAs such as CipherTrust, IronPort, Postini, and Brightmail.
 They are ideally positioned to implement Sender ID checking on inbound 
 mail and have a business reason to do so.

 The second chasm, on the receiving side, requires major ISPs to start 
 implementing inbound checking.  Their initial motivation is to reduce 
 the costs of whitelisting.  Major ISPs negotiate email peering 
 relationships with major senders and maintain, often by hand, 
 whitelists of IP addresses.  Conversion to Sender ID-based whitelisting 
 is an obvious step.  Note that while Sender ID is often viewed as an 
 anti-forgery mechanism, using it as a whitelisting mechanism is simply 
 the other side of the coin.

 After these chasms are crossed, there remains the challenge of getting 
 publishers to transition through increasing levels of severity: from 
 "?" to "~" to "-".  This effort requires cooperation from receivers.

7.3. The need for coordinated deployment.

 The chicken-and-egg problem is this: until forwarders are Sender ID 
 compliant, publishing domains will be reluctant to advance their 
 defaults from "neutral" to "softfail" to "fail".  Until publishing 
 domains have a default of "fail", forwarders may see no reason to 
 comply.

 This problem can be overcome if industry can collectively agree on a 
 deployment schedule that gives all parties enough notice to make the 
 necessary changes.
