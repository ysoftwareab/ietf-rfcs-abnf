INTERNET-DRAFT                              IANA Ethernet Considerations


1. Introduction

   Some IETF protocols make use of Ethernet/802.3 or other IEEE [IEEE]
   802 related communications frame formats and parameters [IEEE802].
   These include addresses and protocol identifiers.

   This document specifies IANA considerations for the allocation of
   code points under the IANA OUI and related parameters.



1.1 Notation in This Document

   This document uses what is called Hexadecimal Notation. Each octet
   (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits giving
   the value of the octet as an unsigned integer and successive octets
   are separated by a hypnen.

   In this document "IAB" standards for Individual Address Block, not
   for Internet Architecture Board.



1.2 MAC Addresses and OUIs

   IEEE 48-bit MAC "Addresses" are the most commonly used Ethernet
   device identifiers and are also called EUI-48 (Extended Unique
   Identifier) identifiers. They are structured into an initial 3 octet
   OUI (Organizarionally Unique Identifier) and an additional 3 octets
   of address assigned by the OUI holder. In addition, for organizations
   not requiring 3 octets worth of identifiers, the IEEE makes IABs
   (Individual Address Blocks) where the first 4 1/2 octets are fixed
   giving the holder of the IAB 1 1/2 octets (12 bits) they can set.
   [802] [IEEE]

   Two bits within the initial 3 bytes have special significance, the
   Group bit (01-00-00) and the Local bit (02-00-00). OUIs are only
   allocated with the Local bit off and the Group bit unspecified.  OUI
   holders may use them to construction multicast addresses by turning
   on the Group bit or unicast addresses by leaving the Group bit zero.

   For globally unique EUI-48 identifiers allocated by an OUI owner, the
   Local bit should be zero. If the Local bit is a one, the identifier
   is normally considered a local identifier under the control of the
   local administrator. The holder of an OUI (or IAB) has no special
   authority over EUI-48 identifiers whose first three (or 4 1/2) octets
   correspond to their OUI (or IAB) with the Local bit on.

   For the SNAP (Subnet Access Protocol) LLC (Local Link Control) frame
   format, OUIs can also be the basis for the allocation of 5 bytes


D. Eastlake                                                     [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT                              IANA Ethernet Considerations


   protocol identifiers that have that OUI as their first three bytes.

   An OUI has been assigned to IANA as described in Section 3 below.
   Allocations of MAC addresses outside this block and of other IEEE 802
   parameter code points may be obtained from the IEEE Registration
   Authority as described in Section 2 below.



2. The IEEE Registration Authority

   At this time, the ultimate source authority for IEEE 802 parameters
   is the IEEE Registration Authority, currently available on the we at
   <http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/>.  Application may be made to
   that authority for parameters.  Fees and other requirements may apply
   although fees are commonly waived for applications from standards
   development organizations.

   A list of allocated OUIs and IABs and their holders is downloadable
   from the IEEE Registration Authority site.

INTERNET-DRAFT                              IANA Ethernet Considerations


3. Allocations under the IANA OUI

   The OUI 00-00-5E has been allocated to IANA by IEEE 802.

   This includes 2**24 multicast addresses from 01-00-5E-00-00-00 to
   01-00-5E-FF-FF-FF and 2**24 unicast addresses from 00-00-5E-00-00-00
   to 00-00-5E-FF-FF-FF.  In addition, 2**16 five octet SNAP SAP
   protocol identifiers are available from 00-00-5E-00-00 to 00-00-5E-
   FF-FF.



3.1 EUI-48 Allocations

   Of these EUI-48 identifiers addresses, the following allocations have
   been made up to now:

      o  The 2**23 multicast addresses from 01-00-5E-00-00-00 through
         01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF have been allocated form IPv4 multicast
         [RFC1112].

      o  The 2**8 unicast addresses from 00-00-5E-00-00-00 through
         00-00-5E-00-00-FF are reserved and require IESG approval for
         allocation.

      o  The 2**8 unicast addresses from 00-00-5E-00-01-00 through
         00-00-5E-00-01-FF have been allocated for the Virtural Router
         Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC3768].



3.1.1 EUI-48 Allocation Considerations

   To simplify recording keeping, all future allocations shall have the
   Group bit unspecified, that is, shall be allocations of parallel
   blocks of multicast and unicast addresses even if one of these two
   types is not needed for the proposed use, except that requests for
   unicast only address blocks may be satisfied out of the available
   addresses in the very large unicast range from 00-00-5E-00-00-00 to
   00-00-5E-7F-FF-FF.

   Allocations must meeting the following requirements:

      must be for standards purposes,

      must be for a block of a power of two addresses starting at a
         boundary which is a not lower power of two, including the
         allocation of one (2**0) address,

      are not to be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain


D. Eastlake                                                     [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT                              IANA Ethernet Considerations


         their own block of addresses from the IEEE, and

      must be documented in an internet-draft or RFC.

   Finally, Expert or IESG approval must be obtained as listed below:

      Small allocations of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 addresses require the
         approval of any one member of the pool of Experts using the
         procedure specified in Section 5 below.

      Medium allocations of 32, 64, 128, or 256 addresses require the
         approval of any two members of the pool of Experts using the
         procedure specified in Section 5 below.

      Allocations of any size, including 512 or more addresses, may be
         made with IESG approval.



3.2 SNAP LLC Protocol Allocation Considerations

   When using the IEEE 802.3 LLC format for a frame, an OUI based
   protocol identifier can be expressed as follows:

         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

   where xx-xx is the frame length and must be small enough not to be
   confused with an Ethertype, yy-yy-yy is an OUI, and zz-zz is a
   protocol number under that OUI allocated by the OUI owner. Such zz-zz
   protocol numbers are available for standards use under the IANA OUI,
   as in

         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-5E-zz-zz

   A number of such allocations have been made. See www.iana.org.

   Such protocol numbers are not to be allocated for any protocol that
   has an Ethertype because that can be expressed in this SNAP SAP
   format by putting an all zeros "OUI" before the Ethertype.
   Allocation of a new SNAP SAP protocol number under the IANA OUI
   requires approval of two Experts from the pool and using the
   procedure specified in Section 5 below.



3.3 EUI-64 Identifier Allocations

   IEEE also defines a system of 64-bit EUIs. Uptake of EUI-64
   identifiers has been limited. They are currently used by the
   following IEEE standards:


D. Eastlake                                                     [Page 6]


INTERNET-DRAFT                              IANA Ethernet Considerations


   o  IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire and i.Link),
   o  IEEE 802.15.4 (also known as ZigBee).
   They are also used to form local use IPv6 addresses ([RFC3513],
   section 2.5.1 and Appendix A).

   Modified EUI-64 identifiers under an OUI are formed by adding a
   5-octet (40-bit) extension as illustrated below where aa-bb-cc-dd-ee
   is the extension.  [RFC4214]

      02-00-5E-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee

   The first octet is show as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified
   EUI-64 identifiers, the sense of the local/global bit is inverted
   compared with EUI-48 identifiers.  It is the globally unique values
   (universal scope) under the IANA OUI that have the 02 bit on while
   those with this bit off are locally assigned and out of scope for
   IANA. As with EUI-48 identifiers, the 01 bit on would indicate a
   group address.

   When the first two octets of the extension are FF-FE, the remainder
   of the extension is a 24 bit vendor-supplied ID as follows:

      02-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy

   where yy-yy-yy is the vendor-supplied ID.

   Certain EUI-64 identifiers under the IANA OUI are reserved for
   holders of IPv4 addresses as follows:

      02-00-5E-FE-xx-xx-xx-xx

   where xx-xx-xx-xx is a 32-bit IPv4 address.



3.4 Other IETF Used MAC Address Prefixes

   All multicast addresses prefixed "33-33", that is the 2**32 multicast
   MAC addresses in the range from 33-33-00-00-00-00 to 33-33-FF-FF-FF-
   FF, have been adopted by the IETF for global IPv6 multicast
   [RFC2464]. These addresses all have the Group bit (the bottom bit of
   the first byte) on as is required to work properly with existing
   hardware as a multicast address; however, they also have the Local
   bit on.  (Historical note: It was the custom during IPv6 design to
   use "3" for example or unknown values and 3333 is the street address
   number of Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center).)

   All "OUIs" prefixed "CF", that is, "OUIs" from CF-00-00 to CF-FF-FF
   are declared by Information RFC [RFC2153] to be available to software
   vendors when allocated by IANA for use in PPP [RFC1661] or for other


D. Eastlake                                                     [Page 7]


INTERNET-DRAFT                              IANA Ethernet Considerations


   uses where an IEEE allocation is "inappropriate". These "OUIs" have
   both the Group and Local bits on. The Group bit, or "multicast", is
   meaningless for PPP.  To quote [RFC2153]: "The 'CF0000' series was
   arbitrarily chosen to match the PPP NLPID 'CF', as a matter of
   mnemonic convenience."

   "OUI" CF-00-00 is reserved and IANA lists multicast address
   CF-00-00-00-00-00 as used for Ethernet loopback tests.



3.3.1 Allocation in the 'CF Series'

   In over a decade of availability, only one "OUI" in the 'CF Series'
   has been allocated thus far ('CF-00-01'). Use of these addresses
   based on IETF allocation is deprecated. IANA is directed not to
   allocate any further "OUIs" in the 'CF Series'.



4. Exhaustion

   When the available space for either multicast or unicast addresses
   under OUI 00-00-5E have been 90% or more exhausted, IANA should
   request an additional OUI from the IEEE Registration Authority for
   IETF standards use.

5. IANA Considerations

   The entirety of this document concerns IANA Considerations for the
   allocation of Ethernet parameters.

   The Expert Pool referred to in this document shall consist of all
   voting members of the IAB and IESG.

   While finite, the universe of numbers from which these allocations
   being made is felt to be sufficiently large that no guidance beyond
   the Expert's good judgment is needed.

   The procedure for Expert approval is that the applicant completes the
   appropriate Template from the Template Annex below and sends it to
   IANA. The Template includes a suggested Expert or Experts from the
   pool.  IANA contacts one or tow of the suggested experts as
   appropriate and obtains their opinion. If, within 30 days, IANA
   receives approvals from the one or two required expert and numbers
   are available, IANA will make the requested allocation. Otherwise,
   the application will be denied.

   A wise applicant will have discussed their application in advance
   with the person or persons they suggest to IANA as Exerts.



6. Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with IANA allocation of parameters under
   the IETF OUI and is not directly concerned with security.
