    Customizing DHCP Configuration on the Basis of Network Topology
                      draft-ietf-dhc-topo-conf-06

Abstract

   DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant
   functionality beyond that which is described in the DHCP base
   specifications.  One aspect of this functionality is support for
   context-specific configuration information.  This memo describes some
   such features and makes recommendations as to how they can be used.

1.  Introduction

   The DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] protocol specifications
   describe how addresses can be allocated to clients based on network
   topology information provided by the DHCP relay infrastructure.
   Address allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP.

   The DHCP protocol also describes mechanisms for provisioning devices
   with additional configuration information; for example, DNS [RFC1034]
   server addresses, default DNS search domains, and similar
   information.

   Although it was the intent of the authors of these specifications
   that DHCP servers would provision devices with configuration
   information appropriate to each device's location on the network,
   this practice was never documented, much less described in detail.

   Existing DHCP server implementations do in fact provide such
   capabilities; the goal of this document is to describe those
   capabilities for the benefit both of operators and of protocol
   designers who may wish to use DHCP as a means for configuring their
   own services, but may not be aware of the capabilities provided by
   most modern DHCP servers.

2.  Terminology

   o  CPE device: Customer Premise Equipment device.  Typically a router
      belonging to the customer that connects directly to the provider
      link.

   o  DHCP, DHCPv4, and DHCPv6.  DHCP refers to the Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol in general and applies to both DHCPv4 and
      DHCPv6.  The terms DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 are used in contexts where it
      is necessary to avoid ambiguity and explain differences.

   o  PE router: Provider Edge router.  The provider router closest to
      the customer.

   o  Routable IP address: an IP address with a scope of use wider than
      the local link.

   o  Shared subnet: a case where two or more subnets of the same
      protocol family are available on the same link.  'Shared subnet'
      terminology is typically used in Unix environments.  It is
      typically called 'multinet' in Windows environment.  The
      administrative configuration inside a Microsoft DHCP server is
      called 'DHCP Superscope'.

3.  Identifying Client's Location by DHCP Servers

   Figure 1 illustrates a small hierarchy of network links with Link D
   serving as a backbone to which the DHCP server is attached.

   Figure 2 illustrates a more complex case.  Although some of its
   aspects are unlikely to be seen in actual production networks, they
   are beneficial for explaining finer aspects of the DHCP protocols.
   Note that some nodes act as routers (which forward all IP traffic)
   and some are relay agents (i.e. run DHCP specific software that
   forwards only DHCP traffic).

   Those diagrams allow us to represent a variety of different network
   configurations and illustrate how existing DHCP servers can provide
   configuration information customized to the particular location from
   which a client is making its request.

   It is important to understand the background of how DHCP works when
   considering those diagrams.  It is assumed that the DHCP clients may
   not have routable IP addresses when they are attempting to obtain
   configuration information.

   The reason for making this assumption is that one of the functions of
   DHCP is to bootstrap the DHCP client's IP address configuration; if
   the client does not yet have an IP address configured, it cannot
   route packets to an off-link DHCP server, therefore some kind of
   relay mechanism is required.

   The details of how packet delivery between clients and servers works
   are different between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, but the essence is the same:
   whether or not the client actually has an IP configuration, it
   generally communicates with the DHCP server by sending its requests
   to a DHCP relay agent on the local link; this relay agent, which has
   a routable IP address, then forwards the DHCP requests to the DHCP
   server (directly or via other relays).  In later stages of the
   configuration when the client has acquired an address and certain
   conditions are met, it is possible for the client to send packets
   directly to the server, thus bypassing the relays.  The conditions
   for such behavior are different for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 and are
   discussed in sections Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.

   To determine the client's point of attachment and link specific
   configuration, the server typically uses the client facing IP address
   of the relay agent.  In some cases the server may use the routable IP
   address of the client, if the client has the routable IP address
   assigned to its interface and it is transmitted in the DHCP message.
   The server is then able to determine the client's point of attachment
   and select appropriate subnet- or link-specific configuration.

   Sometimes it is useful for the relay agents to provide additional
   information about the topology.  A number of extensions have been
   defined for this purpose.  The specifics are different, but the core
   principle remains the same: the relay agent knows exactly where the
   original request came from, so it provides an identifier that will
   help the server to choose appropriate address pool and configuration
   parameters.  Examples of such options are mentioned in the following
   sections.

   Finally, clients may be connected to the same link as the server, so
   no relay agents are required.  In such cases, the DHCPv4 server
   typically uses the IPv4 address assigned to the network interface
   over which the transmission was received to select an appropriate
   subnet.  This is more complicated for DHCPv6, as the DHCPv6 server is
   not required to have any globally unique addresses.  In such cases,
   additional configuration information may need to be required.  Some

Internet-Draft         DHCP Topology Customization          October 2015


   servers allow indicating that a given subnet is directly reachable
   over a specific local network interface.

3.1.  DHCPv4 Specific Behavior

   In some cases in DHCPv4, when a DHCPv4 client has a routable IPv4
   address, the message is unicast to the DHCPv4 server rather than
   going through a relay agent.  Examples of such transmissions are
   renewal (DHCPREQUEST) and address release (DHCPRELEASE).

   The relay agent that receives client's message sets giaddr field to
   the address of the network interface the message was received on.
   The relay agent may insert a relay agent option [RFC3046].

   There are several options defined that are useful for subnet
   selection in DHCPv4.  [RFC3527] defines the Link Selection sub-option
   that is inserted by a relay agent.  This option is particularly
   useful when the relay agent needs to specify the subnet/link on which
   a DHCPv4 client resides, which is different from an IP address that
   can be used to communicate with the relay agent.  The Virtual Subnet
   Selection sub-option, specified in [RFC6607], can also be added by a
   relay agent to specify information in a VPN environment.  In certain
   cases, it is useful for the client itself to specify the Virtual
   Subnet Selection option, e.g. when there are no relay agents involved
   during the VPN set up process.

   Another option that may influence the subnet selection is the IPv4
   Subnet Selection Option, defined in [RFC3011], which allows the
   client to explicitly request allocation from a given subnet.

3.2.  DHCPv6 Specific Behavior

   In DHCPv6 unicast communication is possible in case where the server
   is configured with a Server Unicast option (see Section 22.12 in
   [RFC3315]) and clients are able to take advantage of it.  In such
   cases, once a client is assigned a, presumably global, address, it is
   able to contact the server directly, bypassing any relays.  It should
   be noted that such a mode is completely controllable by
   administrators in DHCPv6.  (They may simply choose to not configure
   server unicast option, thus forcing clients to send their messages
   always via relay agents in every case).

   In the DHCPv6 protocol, there are two core mechanisms defined in
   [RFC3315] that allow a server to distinguish which link the relay
   agent is connected to.  The first mechanism is the link-address field
   in the Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages.  Somewhat contrary to
   its name, relay agents insert in the link-address field an address
   that is typically global and can be used to uniquely identify the



Lemon & Mrugalski        Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         DHCP Topology Customization          October 2015


   link on which the client is located.  In normal circumstances this is
   the solution that is easiest to maintain, as existing address
   assignments can be used and no additional administrative actions
   (like assigning dedicated identifiers for each relay agent, making
   sure they are unique and maintaining a list of such identifiers) are
   needed.  It requires, however, for the relay agent to have an address
   with a scope larger than link-local configured on its client-facing
   interface.

   The second mechanism uses Interface-Id option (see Section 22.18 of
   [RFC3315]) inserted by the relay agent, which identifies the link
   that the client is connected to.  This mechanism may be used for
   example, when the relay agent does not have a globally unique address
   or ULA [RFC4193] configured on the client-facing interface) on the
   client facing interface, thus making the first mechanism not
   feasible.  If the interface-id is unique within an administrative
   domain, the interface-id value may be used to select the appropriate
   subnet.  As there is no guarantee for the uniqueness ([RFC3315] only
   mandates the interface-id to be unique within a single relay agent
   context), it is up to the administrator to check whether the relay
   agents deployed use unique interface-id values.  If the interface-id
   values are not unique, the Interface-id option can not be used to
   determine the client's point of attachment.

   It should be noted that Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages are
   exchanged between relays and servers only.  Clients are never exposed
   to those messages.  Also, servers never receive Relay-reply messages.
   Relay agents must be able to process both Relay-forward (sending
   already relayed message further towards the server, when there is
   more than one relay agent in a chain) and Relay-reply (when sending
   back the response towards the client, when there is more than one
   relay agent in a chain).

   For completeness, we also mention an uncommon, but valid case, where
   relay agents use a link-local address in the link-address field in
   relayed Relay-forward messages.  This may happen if the relay agent
   doesn't have any address with a larger scope on the interface
   connected to that specific link.  Even though link-local addresses
   cannot be automatically used to associate relay agent with a given
   link, with additional configuration information the server may still
   able to select the proper link.  That requires the DHCP server
   software to be able to specify relay agent link-address associated
   with each link or a feature similar to 'shared subnets' (see
   Section 8).  Both may or may not be supported by the server software.
   Network administrator has to manually configure additional
   information that a given subnet uses a relay agent with link-address
   X.  Alternatively, if the relay agent uses link address X and relays
   messages from a subnet A, an administrator can configure that subnet

   recommended configuration, but in cases where it is impossible for
   relay agents to get an address from the subnet they are relaying
   from, it may be a viable solution.

   DHCPv6 also has support for more finely grained link identification,
   using Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC6221] (LDRA).  In this
   case, the link-address field is set to Unspecified_address (::), but
   the DHCPv6 server also receives an Interface-Id option from the relay
   agent that can be used to more precisely identify the client's
   location on the network.

   What this means in practice is that the DHCP server in all cases has
   sufficient information to pinpoint, at the very least, the layer 3
   link to which the client is connected, and in some cases which layer
   2 link the client is connected to, when the layer 3 link is
   aggregated out of multiple layer 2 links.

   In all cases, then, the DHCPv6 server will have a link-identifying IP
   address, and in some cases it may also have a link-specific
   identifier (e.g.  Interface-Id Option or Link Address Option defined
   in Section 5 of [RFC6977]).  It should be noted that there the link-
   specific identifier is unique only within the scope of the link-
   identifying IP address.  For example, link-specific identifier of
   "eth0" for a relay agent with IPv4 address 2001:db8::1 means
   something different than "eth0" for a relay agent with address
   2001:db8::2.

   It is also possible for link-specific identifiers to be nested, so
   that the actual identifier that identifies the link is an aggregate
   of two or more link-specific identifiers sent by a set of LDRAs in a
   chain; in general this functions exactly as if a single identifier
   were received from a single LDRA, so we do not treat it specially in
   the discussion below, but sites that use chained LDRA configurations
   will need to be aware of this when configuring their DHCPv6 servers.

   The Virtual Subnet Selection Options, present in DHCPv4, are also
   defined for DHCPv6.  The use case is the same as in DHCPv4: the relay
   agent inserts VSS options that can help the server to select the
   appropriate subnet with its address pool and associated configuration
   options.  See [RFC6607] for details.

4.  Simple Subnetted Network

   Consider Figure 1 in the context of a simple subnetted network.  In
   this network, there are four leaf subnets: links A, B, F and G, on
   which DHCP clients will be configured.  Relays A, B, C and D in this
   example are represented in the diagram as IP routers with an embedded

   relay function, because this is a very typical configuration, but the
   relay function can also be provided in a separate node on each link.

   In a simple network like this, there may be no need for link-specific
   configuration in DHCPv6, since local routing information is delivered
   through router advertisements.  However, in IPv4, it is very typical
   to configure the default route using DHCP; in this case, the default
   route will be different on each link.  In order to accomplish this,
   the DHCP server will need link-specific configuration for the default
   route.

   To illustrate, we will use an example from a hypothetical DHCP server
   that uses a simple JSON notation [RFC7159] for configuration.
   Although we know of no DHCP server that uses this specific syntax,
   most modern DHCP server provides similar functionality.

       }
   }

   In Figure 3, we see a configuration example for this scenario: a set
   of prefixes, each of which has a set of options and a list of links
   for which it is on-link.  We have defined one option for each prefix:
   a routers option.  This option contains a list of values; each list
   only has one value, and that value is the IP address of the router
   specific to the prefix.

   When the DHCP server receives a request, it searches the list of
   prefixes for one that encloses the link-identifying IP address
   provided by the client or relay agent.  The DHCP server then examines
   the options list associated with that prefix and returns those
   options to the client.

   So for example a client connected to link A in the example would have
   a link-identifying IP address within the 192.0.2.0/26 prefix, so the
   DHCP server would match it to that prefix.  Based on the
   configuration, the DHCP server would then return a routers option
   containing a single IP address: 192.0.2.1.  A client on link F would
   have a link-identifying address in the 192.0.2.128/26 prefix, and
   would receive a routers option containing the IP address 192.0.2.129.

5.  Relay Agent Running on a Host

   A relay agent is DHCP software that may be run on any IP node.
   Although it is typically run on a router, this is by no means
   required by the DHCP protocol.  The relay agent is simply a service
   that operates on a link, receiving link-local multicasts (IPv6) or
   broadcasts (IPv4) and relaying them, using IP routing, to a DHCP
   server.  As long as the relay has an IP address on the link, and a
   default route or more specific route through which it can reach a
   DHCP server, it need not be a router, or even have multiple
   interfaces.

   A relay agent can be run on a host connected to two links.  That case
   is presented in Figure 2.  There is router B that is connected to
   links D and E.  At the same time there is also a host that is
   connected to the same links.  The relay agent software is running on
   that host.  That is uncommon, but a valid configuration.

6.  Cascaded Relays

   Let's observe another case, shown in Figure 2.  Note that in this
   configuration, the clients connected to link G will send their
   requests to relay D which will forward its packets directly to the
   DHCP server.  That is typical, but not the only possible
   configuration.  It is possible to configure relay agent D to forward
   client messages to relay E which in turn will send it to the DHCP

   server.  This configuration is sometimes referred to as cascade relay
   agents.

   Note that the relaying mechanism works differently in DHCPv4 and in
   DHCPv6.  In DHCPv4 only the first relay is able to set the giaddr
   field in the DHCPv4 packet.  Any following relays that receive that
   packet will not change it as the server needs giaddr information from
   the first relay (i.e. the closest to the client).  The server will
   send the response back to the giaddr address, which is the address of
   the first relay agent that saw the client's message.  That means that
   the client messages travel on a different path than the server's
   responses.  A message from client connected to link G will travel via
   relay D, relay E and to the server.  A response message will be sent
   from the server to relay D via router B, and relay D will send it to
   the client on link G.

   Relaying in DHCPv6 is more structured.  Each relay agent encapsulates
   a packet that is destined to the server and sends it towards the
   server.  Depending on the configuration, that can be a server's
   unicast address, a multicast address or next relay agent address.
   The next relay repeats the encapsulation process.  Although the
   resulting packet is more complex (may have up to 32 levels of
   encapsulation if the packet traveled through 32 relays), every relay
   may insert its own options and it is clear which relay agent inserted
   which option.

7.  Regional Configuration Example

   In the Figure 2 example, link C is a regional backbone for an ISP.
   Link E is also a regional backbone for that ISP.  Relays A, B, C and
   D are PE routers, and Links A, B, F and G are actually link
   aggregators with individual layer 2 circuits to each customer--for
   example, the relays might be DSLAMs or cable head-end systems.  At
   each customer site we assume there is a single CPE device attached to
   the link.

   We further assume that links A, B, F and G are each addressed by a
   single prefix, although it would be equally valid for each CPE device
   to be numbered on a separate prefix.

   In a real-world deployment, there would likely be many more than two
   PE routers connected to each regional backbone; we have kept the
   number small for simplicity.

   In the example presented in Figure 4, the goal is to configure all
   the devices within a region with server addresses local to that
   region, so that service traffic does not have to be routed between
   regions unnecessarily.

   In this example, when a request comes in to the DHCP server with a
   link-identifying IP address in the 2001:DB8::/40 prefix, it is
   identified as being on link A.  The DHCPv6 server then looks on the
   list of links to see what region the client is in.  Link A is
   identified as being in omashu.  The DHCPv6 server then looks up
   omashu in the set of regions, and discovers a list of region-specific
   options.

Internet-Draft         DHCP Topology Customization          October 2015


   The DHCP server then resolves the domain names listed in the options
   and sends a sip-server option containing the IP addresses that the
   resolver returned for sip.omashu.example.org, and a dns-server option
   containing the IP addresses returned by the resolver for
   dns1.omashu.example.org and dns2.omashu.example.org.  Depending on
   the server capability and configuration, it may cache resolved
   responses for specific period of time, repeat queries every time or
   even keep the response until reconfiguration or shutdown.  For more
   detailed discussion see Section 7 of [RFC7227].

   Similarly, if the DHCP server receives a request from a DHCP client
   where the link-identifying IP address is contained by the prefix
   2001:DB8:300::/40, then the DHCP server identifies the client as
   being connected to link G.  The DHCP server then identifies link G as
   being in the gaoling region, and returns the sip-servers and dns-
   servers options specific to that region.

   As with the previous example, the exact configuration syntax and
   structure shown above does not precisely match what existing DHCP
   servers do, but the behavior illustrated in this example can be
   accomplished with most existing modern DHCP servers.

8.  Multiple subnets on the same link

   There are scenarios where there is more than one subnet from the same
   protocol family (i.e. two or more IPv4 subnets or two or more IPv6
   subnets) configured on the same link.  Such a configuration is often
   referred to as 'shared subnets' in Unix environments or 'multinet' in
   Microsoft terminology.

   The most frequently mentioned use case is a network renumbering where
   some services are migrated to the new addressing scheme, but some
   aren't yet.

   Second example is expanding the allocation space.  In DHCPv4 and for
   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, there could be cases where multiple subnets
   are needed, because a single subnet may be too small to accommodate
   the client population.

   The third use case covers allocating addresses (or delegation
   prefixes) that are not the same as topological information.  For
   example, the link-address is on prefix X and the addresses to be
   delegated is on prefix Y.  This could be based on differentiating
   information (i.e., whether device is CPE or CM in DOCSIS) or just
   because the link-address/giaddr is different from the actual
   allocation space.

Internet-Draft         DHCP Topology Customization          October 2015


   The fourth use case is a cable network, where cable modems and the
   devices connected behind them are connected to the same layer 2 link.
   However, operators want the cable modems and user devices to get
   addresses from distinct address spaces, so users couldn't easily
   access their modems management interfaces.

   To support such a configuration, additional differentiating
   information is required.  Many DHCP server implementations offer a
   feature that is typically called client classification.  The server
   segregates incoming packets into one or more classes based on certain
   packet characteristics, e.g. presence or value of certain options or
   even a match between existing options.  Servers require additional
   information to handle such configuration, as they cannot use the
   topographical property of the relay addresses alone to properly
   choose a subnet.  Exact details of such operation is not part of the
   DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 protocols and is implementation dependent.

9.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to Dave Thaler for suggesting that even though "everybody
   knows" how DHCP servers are deployed in the real world, it might be
   worthwhile to have an IETF document that explains what everybody
   knows, because in reality not everybody is an expert in how DHCP
   servers are administered.  Thanks to Andre Kostur, Carsten Strotmann,
   Simon Perreault, Jinmei Tatuya, Suresh Krishnan, Qi Sun, Jean-
   Francois Tremblay, Marcin Siodelski and Bernie Volz for their

10.  Security Considerations

   This document explains existing practice with respect to the use of
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC2131] and Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol Version 6 [RFC3315].  The security
   considerations for these protocols are described in their
   specifications and in related documents that extend these protocols.
   This document introduces no new functionality, and hence no new
   security considerations.
