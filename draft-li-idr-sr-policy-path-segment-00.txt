      SR Policy Extensions for Path Segment and Bidirectional Path
                 draft-li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-00

Abstract

   A Segment Routing (SR) policy is a set of candidate SR paths
   consisting of one or more segment lists with necessary path
   attributes.  For each SR path, it may also have its own path
   attributes, and Path Segment is one of them.  A Path Segment is
   defined to identify an SR path, which can be used for performance
   measurement, path correlation, and end-2-end path protection.  Path
   Segment can be also used to correlate two unidirctional SR paths into
   a bidirectional SR path which is required in some scenarios, for
   example, mobile backhaul transport network.

   This document defines extensions to BGP to distribute SR policies
   carrying Path Segment and bidirectional path information.

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that
   explicitly indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress
   node.  The ingress node steers packets into a specific path according
   to the Segment Routing Policy ( SR Policy) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  For distributing SR
   policies to the headend, [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy]

Internet-Draft   Path ID and Bi-directional Path in BGP        June 2019


   specifies a mechanism by using BGP, and new sub-TLVs are defined for
   SR Policies in BGP UPDATE message.

   In many use cases such as performance measurement, the path to which
   the packets belong is required to be identified.  Futhermore, in some
   scenarios, for example, mobile backhaul transport network, there are
   requirements to support bidirectional path.  However, there is no
   path identification information for each Segment List in the SR
   Policies defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  Also,
   the SR Policies defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]
   only supports unidirectional SR paths.

   Therefore, this document defines the extension to SR policies that
   carry Path Segment in the Segment List and support bidirectional
   path.  The Path Segment can be a Path Segment in SR-MPLS
   [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment] , or a Path Segment in SRv6
   [I-D.li-spring-srv6-path-segment], or other IDs that can identify a
   path.  Also, this document defines extensions to BGP to distribute SR
   policies carriying Path Segment and bidirectional path information.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8402] and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

3.  Path Segment in SR Policy

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] , the SR
   Policy encoding structure is as follows:

      SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
      Attributes:
         Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
            Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                Binding SID
                Preference
                Priority
                Policy Name
                Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                Segment List
                    Weight
                    Segment
                    Segment
                    ...
                ...

   An SR path can be specified by an Segment List sub-TLV that contains
   a set of segment sub-TLVs and other sub-TLVs as shown above.  As

Internet-Draft   Path ID and Bi-directional Path in BGP        June 2019


   defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], a candidate path
   includes multiple SR paths specified by SID list.  The Path Segment
   can be used for idendifying an SR path(specified by SID list).  Also,
   it can be used for identifying an SR candidate path or an SR Policy
   in some use cases if needed.  New SR Policy encoding structure is
   expressed as below:

      SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
      Attributes:
         Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
            Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                Binding SID
                Preference
                Priority
                Policy Name
                Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                Path Segment
                Segment List
                    Weight
                    Path Segment
                    Segment
                    Segment
                    ...
                Segment List
                    Weight
                    Path Segment
                    Segment
                    Segment
                    ...
                ...


   The Path Segment can appear at both segment-list level and candidate
   path level, and generally it SHOULD also appear only at one level
   depending upon use case.  Path segment at segment list level and at
   candidate path level may be same or may be different based on usecase
   and the ID allocation scope.  When multiple Path Segments appear in
   both levels, it means the the Path Segment associated with candidate
   path and segment list SHOULD both be inserted into the SID list.

3.1.  SR Path Segment Sub-TLV

   This section defines an SR Path Segment sub-TLV.

   An SR Path Segment sub-TLV can be included in the segment list sub-
   TLV to identify an SID list, and it MUST appear only once within a
   Segment List sub-TLV.  It has the following format:

   MUST be ignored on receipt.

   following types:

   o  0: SR-MPLS Path Segment

   o  1: SRv6 Path Segment

   o  2-255:Reserved

   Path Segment: The Path Segment of an SR path.  The Path Segment type
   is indicated by the Segment Type(ST) field.  It can be a Path Segment
   in SR-MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment], which is 32-bits
   value, or a Path Segment in SRv6 [I-D.li-spring-srv6-path-segment],
   which is a 128-bits value, or other IDs that can identify a path.

4.  SR Policy for Bidirectional Path

   In some scenarios, for example, mobile backhaul transport network,
   there are requirements to support bidirectional path.  In SR, a
   bidirectional path can be represented as a binding of two
   unidirectional SR paths.  This document also defines new sub-TLVs to
   describe an SR bidirectional path.  An SR policy carrying SR
   bidirectional path information is expressed as below:

       SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
           Attributes: Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
           Tunnel Type: SR Policy
               Binding SID
               Preference

4.1.  SR Bidirectional Path Sub-TLV

   This section defines an SR bidirectional path sub-TLV to specify a
   bidirectional path, which contains a Segment List sub-TLV
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] and an associated Reverse
   Path Segment List as defined at section 4.2.  The SR bidirectional
   path sub-TLV has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   Sub-TLVs:

   o  An Segment List sub-TLV

   o  An associated Reverse Path Segment List sub-TLV

4.2.  SR Reverse Path Segment List Sub-TLV

   An SR Reverse Path Segment List sub-TLV is defined to specify an SR
   reverse path associated with the path specified by the Segment List
   in the same SR Bidirectional Path Sub-TLV, and it has the following
   format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   o  An mandatory SR Path Segment sub-TLV that contains the Path
      Segment of the reverse SR path.

   o  Zero or more Segment sub-TLVs to specify the reverse SR path.

   The Segment sub-TLVs in the Reverse Path Segment List sub-TLV
   provides the information of the reverse SR path, which can be used
   for directing egress BFD peer to use specific path for the reverse
   direction of the BFD session [I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed] or other
   applications.

5.  Operations

   The document does not bring new operation beyong the description of
   operations defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  The
   existing operations defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] can apply to this document
   directly.

   Typically but not limit to, the unidirectional or bidirectional SR
   policies carrying path identification infomation are configured by a
   controller.

   After configuration, the unidirectional or bidirectional SR policies
   carrying path identification infomation will be advertised by BGP
   update messages.  The operation of advertisement is the same as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy], as well as the
   receiption.

   The consumer of the unidirectional or bidirectional SR policies is
   not the BGP process, it can be any applications, such as performance
   measurement [I-D.gandhi-spring-udp-pm].  The operation of sending
   information to consumers is out of scope of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations
