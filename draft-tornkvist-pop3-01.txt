   Notification - An extension to the Post Office Protocol version 3
		<draft-tornkvist-pop3-01.txt>

Abstract

   This memo describes an optional extension to the Post Office Protocol
   version 3 (POP3), which introduces a possibility for a POP3 client to
   be notified by a  POP3  server  whenever  the  clients  mail-drop  is
   accessed.

2. Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol version 3, as described in [POP3], is a
   simple and low-cost method of enabling mail access. The host making
   use of the POP3 service is referred to here as the "client", and
   the host providing the service as the "server". When a client
   wants to retrieve mail from a server, a TCP connection to the
   server is established. The client then uses various POP3 commands to
   access the mail-drop. Thus every time a client wants to check for
   new mail he has to poll the server. For a mail-drop
   which seldom receives new mails this is obvious not economical.
   It may also be a security issue since repeated attempts to
   access the server are more vulnerable to interception. This
   memo tries to remedy this by introducing the concept of notification,
   and describes how a client can request that the server shall
   notify the client when any changes have been made to the clients
   mail-drop.

3. Operation

   Two new POP3 command named NTFY and +NTFY are added. The NTFY
   command is used by the client in order to request the server that
   it should notify the client whenever the clients mail-drop is
   accessed. The +NTFY command is used by the server to notify a
   client that the clients mail-drop has been accessed.

   After the server has sent a +NTFY command, both the client and
   the server MUST enter the AUTHORIZATION state, as described in
   [POP3].

   As soon as a server tries to establish a TCP connection to be
   used for notification, it also removes the request for notification.
   It is up to the client to issue a new NTFY command if he wants
   to be notified again.

   The client can only issue the NTFY command in the TRANSACTION state.

   A request for notification will not be activated until the
   POP3 session enters the UPDATE state. During the TRANSACTION
   state it is possible to cancel the request for notification as
   described in the chapter: "NTFY Sent by the Client".

4. NTFY Sent by the Client

   This command can only be sent when the client is in the TRANSACTION
   state.

      NTFY timeout [hostname port-number [timestamp]]

         Arguments:
             a timeout value in minutes, specified as an integer,
             greater or equal to zero, an optional hostname and
             port-number that specifies where to deliver the
             notification, an optional timestamp to be used as
             an APOP challenge

         Restrictions:
             may only be given in the TRANSACTION state

         Discussion:
             The POP3 server issues a positive response if requests
             for notification can be serviced. The timeout value
             specifies for how long time the server shall maintain
             the request for notification. A timeout value of zero
             shall remove any existing request for notification at
             the server.

             A server shall only store one request per user. Hence,
             a zero timeout value need not be accompanied by any other
             argument. As a result of this, a request for notification
             should not be activated until the POP3 session enters the
             UPDATE state.

             A server which implements this command must be able to
             serve timeout values ranging from 0 - 255. However, by
             using the capability extension [CAPA], a server may however
             announce a greater maximim value for the timeout (see also
             the chapter: "New Capabilities"). A negative timeout value
             should result in an error response.

             If APOP authentication is to be used. A challenge timestamp
             can be include as the last argument. Later, when the server
             issues the notification, it sends the corrsponding digest
             message (see also the description of +NTFY command and the
             chapter: "Security Considerations").

         Possible Responses:
             +OK
             -ERR

INTERNET DRAFT    Notification - An extension to POP3   11 December 1998


         Examples:
             C: NTFY 60 campari.rmit.edu.au 9411
             S: +OK Request for notification accepted

             C: NTFY 300 campari.rmit.edu.au 9411
             S: -ERR Timeout value too big
             C: NTFY 255 campari.rmit.edu.au 9411
             S: +OK Request for notification accepted

             C: NTFY 0
             S: +OK Request for notification removed

5. +NTFY Sent by the Server

   When a client is to be notified about changes made to his mail-drop,
   the server establish a TCP connection to the specified host and port
   number. As soon this is done, the request for notification is erased
   from the server. This is done regardless if the connection was
   successful or not.

      +NTFY name [digest]

         Arguments:
             A name, specifying the mail-drop in question, and
             if APOP authentication is to be used, a digest
             argument.

         Restrictions:
             Only one attempt to contact the client will be made.

         Discussion:
             As soon the server has sent this command, both the
             client and the server are supposed to enter the
             AUTHORIZATION state. The digest argument shall correspond
             to the msg-id sent by the client in a preceding NTFY
             command.

         Examples:
             S: +NTFY mrose c4c9334bac560ecc979e58001b3e22fb

6. Alteration to the UPDATE State

   A server which has received a request for notification shall not
   make it valid until the UPDATE state has been entered. This is
   needed so that a client can change or clear a request for
   notification previously done in the same POP3 session.

7. New capabilities

   For those servers which implements capabilities [CAPA]. The
   following new capability SHOULD be used.

         CAPA tag:
           NTFY capability

         Arguments:
           The maximum timeout value the server will
           maintain a request for notification.

         Added commands:
           NTFY
           +NTFY

         Standard commands affected:
           none

         Announced states / possible differences:
           both / no

         Commands valid in states:
           TRANSACTION

         Specific reference:
           this document

         Discussion:
           The NTFY capability indicates that the server implements
           the method described in this memo for handling request
           for notification. The timeout value returned is the maximum
           time in minutes the server will maintain such a request.
           A server MUST at least be able to maintain a request for
           notification for 255 minutes.

8. Security Considerations

   After a client has been notified by a server, the session MUST
   enter the AUTHORIZATION state. The main reason for this is to
   not introduce a new method for POP3 authentication. Ways
   to perform POP3 authentication is described in [POP3], [POP-AUTH]
   and [SASL].

   NB: When APOP is used for authentication, it is important that a
   client really check that the digest, sent from the server in the
   +NTFY command, really match the challenge most previously sent by
   the client. This MUST be done in order to avoid possible masquerade

   attacks, where an attacker may have obtained the host and port
   information (e.g by sniffing earlier packets being sent).
