  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The Message Session Relay Protocol <a href="#RFC4975">(MSRP)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4975]</cite> expects to use <a href="#RFC4976">MSRP relays</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4976]</cite> as a means for Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement. However, many Session Initiation Protocol <a href="#RFC3261">(SIP)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3261]</cite> networks, which deploy MSRP, contain Middleboxes. These Middleboxes anchor and control media, perform tasks such as NAT traversal, performance monitoring, lawful intercept, address domain bridging, interconnect Service Layer Agreement (SLA) policy enforcement, and so on. One example is the Interconnection Border Control Function <a href="#GPP23228">(IBCF)</a> <cite title="NONE">[GPP23228]</cite>, defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The IBCF controls a media relay that handles all types of SIP session media such as voice, video, MSRP, etc.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">MSRP, as defined in <a href="#RFC4975">RFC 4975</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4975]</cite> and <a href="#RFC4976">RFC 4976</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4976]</cite>, cannot anchor through Middleboxes. The reason is that MSRP messages have routing information embedded in the message. Without an extension such as CEMA, Middleboxes must read the message to change the routing information. This occurs because Middleboxes modify the address:port information in the Session Description Protocol <a href="#RFC4566">(SDP)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4566]</cite> c/m-line in order to anchor media. Since the active MSRP UA establishes the MSRP TCP connection based on the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, this means that the MSRP connection will not, unless the Middlebox also modifies the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute, be routed through the Middlebox. In many scenarios this will prevent the MSRP connection from being established. In addition, if the Middlebox modifies the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, then the MSRP URI comparison procedure <a href="#RFC4975">[RFC4975]</a>, which requires consistency between the address information in the MSRP messages and the address information carried in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, will fail. Also the matching will fail if Middleboxes modify the address information in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The only way to achieve interoperability in this situation is for the Middlebox to be a MSRP back-to-back User Agent (B2BUA). Here the MSRP B2BUA acts as the endpoint for the MSRP signaling and media, performs the corresponding modification in the associated MSRP messages, and originates a new MSRP session towards the actual remote endpoint.  However, this interoperability comes at the cost of exposing the MSRP message in clear text to the MSRP B2BUA. This is a serious violation of the <a href="#RFC3724">end-to-end principle</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3724]</cite>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This specification defines an MSRP extension, Connection Establishment for Media Anchoring (CEMA). CEMA in most cases allows MSRP endpoints to communicate through Middleboxes without a need for the Middleboxes to be a MSRP B2BUA. In such cases, Middleboxes that want to anchor the MSRP connection simply modify the SDP c/m-line address information, similar to what it does for non-MSRP media types. MSRP endpoints that support the CEMA extension will use the SDP c/m-line address information for establishing the TLS connection for sending and receiving MSRP messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">The CEMA extension is fully backward compatible. In scenarios where MSRP endpoints do not support the CEMA extension, an MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA extension behaves in the same way as an MSRP endpoint that does not support it. The CEMA extension only provides an alternative mechanism for negotiating and providing address information for the MSRP TCP connection. After the creation of the MSRP TCP connection, an MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA extension acts according to the procedures for creating MSRP messages, performing checks when receiving MSRP messages defined in RFC 4975 and, when it is using a relay for MSRP communications, RFC 4976.</p>

Note the MSRP B2BUA is distinct from a SIP B2BUA. A SIP B2BUA terminates a SIP session and reoriginates that session towards the SIP endpoint. In the context of MSRP, a first SIP endpoint initiates a SIP session towards the remote SIP endpoint. However, that INVITE may go through, for example, an outbound Proxy or inbound Proxy to route to the remote SIP endpoint.  That SIP session negotiates a MSRP session that may or may not follow the SIP session path. Although often the case, there is no requirement to co-locate the SIP network elements with the MSRP network elements.</dd>

<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Applicability Statement</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This document defines an MSRP extension, Connection Establishment for Media Anchoring (CEMA). Support of the extension is optional. MSRP endpoints implement the extension in order to allow MSRP communication in networks where Middleboxes anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for the Middleboxes to decode and rewrite MSRP messages and enabling end-to-end security. The document also defines a Session Description Protocol (SDP) <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a> attribute, a=msrp-cema, that can be used by MSRP endpoints to indicate support of the CEMA extension.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">An important use case for CEMA are Third-Generation Partnership Program Internet Multimedia System (3GPP IMS) SIP networks. These networks use Middleboxes for various functions. Moreover, these networks have the capability for all endpoints to use Name-based TLS Authentication.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">There is nothing special about 3GPP IMS SIP networks to indicate the use of CEMA. Rather, CEMA is an important update to MSRP that closes a number of existing security issues and creates a foundation for closing other security issues in the future. Therefore, CEMA is for all MSRP deployments that use Middleboxes. Moreover, because of the presence of secure transport, CEMA is for all MSRP deployments, including those without Middleboxes.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">When a CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint sends an SDP offer for MSRP, it generates the SDP offer according to the procedures in RFC 4975. In addition, the endpoint follows RFC 4976 if it is using a relay for MSRP communication. The endpoint also performs the following additions and modifications:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The MSRP endpoint MUST include an SDP a=msrp-cema attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP offer.</li>
<li>If the MSRP endpoint is not using a relay for MSRP communication, it MUST include an SDP a=setup attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP offer, according to the procedures in <a href="#RFC6135">RFC 6135</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6135]</cite>.</li>
<li>If the MSRP endpoint is using a relay for MSRP communication, it MUST include the address information of the relay (the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute), rather than the address information of itself, in the SDP c/m-line associated with the MSRP media description. In addition, it MUST include an SDP a=setup:actpass attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP offer.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">The MSRP endpoint then receives the first SDP answer to the SDP offer above. The SDP answer indicates that the remote MSRP endpoint accepted the offered MSRP media if the port number of the MSRP media description is not zero. If the MSRP media description of the SDP answer does not contain an SDP a=msrp-cema attribute, the MSRP endpoint makes the following checks. If either or both of these checks fails, the MSRP endpoint MUST fallback to RFC 4975 behavior, by sending a new SDP offer according to the procedures in RFC 4975 and RFC 4976. The new offer MUST NOT contain an SDP a=msrp-cema attribute.</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP media description does not match the information in the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute, and the MSRP media description contains an SDP a=setup:active attribute (indicating that the remote MSRP endpoint is "active").</li>
<li>The MSRP media description contains multiple SDP a=path attributes, indicating the use of MSRP relays.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.5">In the absence of the SDP a=msrp-cema attribute in the new offer, the Middlebox MUST act as an MSRP B2BUA to anchor MSRP media. Note the originating endpoint should reject the session if it can detect the MSRP B2BUA is not the desired remote endpoint.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.6">The MSRP endpoint can send the new offer within the existing <a href="#RFC3261">early dialog</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3261]</cite>, or it can terminate the early dialog and establish a new dialog by sending the new offer in a new initial INVITE request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.7">In all other cases, where the MSRP endpoint becomes "active", it MUST use the SDP c/m-line for establishing the MSRP TLS connection. If the MSRP endpoint becomes "passive", it will wait for the remote MSRP endpoint to establish the TLS connection, according to the procedures in RFC 4975.</p>

The MSRP endpoint MUST NOT insert an SDP a=msrp-cema attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP answer.</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Both MSRP endpoints are using relays for MSRP communication. An endpoint can detect the remote MSRP endpoint is using a relay for MSRP communication if the MSRP media description of the SDP offer contains multiple SDP a=path attributes.</li>
<li>The remote MSRP endpoint uses a relay for MSRP communication, and will become "active" either by default or if the MSRP media description of the SDP offer contains an SDP a=setup:active attribute. This case indicates the remote MSRP endpoint does not support the CEMA extension. A CEMA-enabled endpoint would include an SDP a=setup:actpass attribute in the SDP offer, as described in <a href="#S.offerer">Section 4.2</a>.</li>
<li>The MSRP endpoint uses a relay for MSRP communication and is not able to become "passive". The indication for this is the MSRP media description of the offer contains an SDP a=setup:passive attribute. This will not occur with a CEMA-enabled endpoint, as it cannot include an SDP a=setup:passive attribute in an SDP offer, as described in RFC 6135.</li>
<li>The MSRP media description of the SDP offer does not contain an SDP a=msrp-cema attribute, the SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP media description does not match the information in the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute, and the remote MSRP endpoint will become "active", either by default, or if the MSRP media description of the SDP offer contains an SDP a=setup:active attribute.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">An MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA extension MUST support the mechanism defined in RFC 6135, as it extends the number of scenarios where one can use the CEMA extension. An example is where a MSRP endpoint is using a relay for MSRP communication, and it needs to be "passive" in order to use the CEMA extension, instead of doing a fallback to RFC 4975 behavior.</p>

</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> General</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">This document does not specify explicit Middlebox behavior, even though Middleboxes enable some of the procedures described here.  However, as one rationale for the CEMA extension is to allow MSRP endpoints to communicate over end-to-end secure paths in networks where Middleboxes that want to anchor media are present, this document makes certain assumptions regarding to how such Middleboxes behave.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> MSRP Awareness</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">In order to support interoperability between UAs that support the CEMA extension and UAs that do not support the extension, the Middlebox is MSRP aware. This means that it implements MSRP B2BUA functionality. The Middlebox enables that functionality in cases where the remote endpoint does not support the CEMA extension. In cases where at least one MSRP endpoint supports the CEMA extension, the Middlebox can simply modify the SDP c/m-line address information for the MSRP connection.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.3">5.3.</a> TCP Connection Reuse</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">Middleboxes do not need to parse and modify the MSRP payload when endpoints use the CEMA extension. A Middlebox that does not parse the MSRP payload probably will not be able to reuse TCP connections for multiple MSRP sessions. Instead, in order to associate an MSRP message with a specific session, the Middlebox often assigns a unique local address:port combination for each MSRP session.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.4">5.4.</a> SDP Integrity</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">This document assumes that Middleboxes are able to modify the SDP address information associated with the MSRP media. Middleboxes cannot be deployed in environments that require end-to-end SDP protection using <a href="#RFC4916">SIP identity</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4916]</cite>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.5">5.5.</a> TLS</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.1">The Middlebox relays MSRP media packets at the transport layer. The TLS handshake and resulting security association (SA) are established peer-to-peer between the MSRP endpoints. The Middlebox will see encrypted MSRP media packets, but is unable to inspect the clear text content.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">In some cases, the CEMA extension could make it easier for a man in the middle (MiTM) to transparently insert itself in the communication between MSRP endpoints in order to monitor or record unprotected MSRP communication. Therefore, endpoints MUST use encrypted channels. For base interoperability, a CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint MUST implement TLS.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> <a href="#sec-security-tls" id="sec-security-tls">TLS Usage</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">The CEMA extension supports the usage of name-based authentication for TLS in the presence of Middleboxes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">If a Middlebox acts as a TLS B2BUA, MSRP endpoints will be able to use fingerprint based authentication for TLS, no matter if they support the CEMA extension or not. In such cases, as the Middlebox acts as TLS endpoints, MSRP endpoints might be given an incorrect impression that there is an end-to-end security association (SA) between the MSRP endpoints.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.3">If a Middlebox does not act as a TLS B2BUA, fingerprint based authentication will not work, as the "SIP Identity" based integrity protection of SDP will break. Therefore, in addition to the authentication mechanisms defined in RFC 4975, an MSRP endpoint supporting the CEMA extension MAY support an authentication mechanism that does not rely on peer-to-peer SDP integrity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.4">It is RECOMMENDED that an MSRP endpoint support one of the following authentication mechanisms:</p>

<ol>
<li>TLS certificates together with support of interacting with a <a href="#RFC6072">Certificate Management Service</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6072]</cite>, to which it publishes the public version of its own self-signed certificate and from which it fetches on demand the public certificates of other endpoints.</li>
<li>TLS-PSK managed by MIKEY-TICKET Based Key Management and Key Management Service<a href="#RFC6043">[RFC6043]</a>. Note that 3GPP has specified the MIKEY-TICKET based Key Management and Key Management Service authentication mechanism for the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).  Thus it will be available in that environment.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.5">When an MSRP endpoint generates an SDP offer for MSRPS, in addition to the SDP attributes associated with the TLS authentication mechanisms described in RFC 4975, it MUST include any information elements associated with the other authentication mechanisms that it supports.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.6">Unless the MSRP endpoints are able to use name-based authentication, and they support a common authentication mechanism, they MUST use that mechanism. If the MSRP endpoints do not support such common authentication mechanism, they MUST try fingerprint-based authentication, which will succeed if there are no Middleboxes present. If that also fails, the MSRP endpoints MUST either:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Consider the TLS authentication as failed, in accordance with RFC 4975; or</li>
<li>If something like SIPS protects the SIP signaling between the MSRP endpoints, use fingerprint based authentication without requiring peer-to-peer SDP integrity, and thus trust the network endpoints in the signaling path for SDP integrity.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.8">As defined in RFC 4975, if TLS authentication fails, the user needs to be able to decide whether to try to establish an MSRP connection in the likely scenario of intercepted, altered, or forged connections</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.3">6.3.</a> TLS and Insecure Signaling</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">MSRP is the only SIP-based media transport that has a layer violation. MSRP media includes routing information, including from and to URIs. Other SIP-based media can have separate paths for signaling and media and can have end-to-end integrity of the media. Except for MSRP, SIP-based media can flow through routers, NATs, <a href="#RFC5766">TURN servers</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5766]</cite>, <a href="#RFC5389">STUN servers</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5389]</cite>, and so on without modification.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">CEMA provides an environment necessary for end-to-end integrity of MSRP media. CEMA makes it possible to route MSRP media without requiring modification of the media. This is what enables end-to-end, cryptographic integrity assurance. However, while CEMA is a necessary prerequisite for end-to-end integrity, it is not sufficient.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.3">CEMA mandates an integrity-protected media channel. At the base level, all CEMA endpoints MUST support TLS. Unless the CEMA endpoints negotiate a stronger communications mechanism, the endpoints MUST use TLS, even if they happen to not use a Middlebox for routing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.4">One issue with mandating TLS is the availability of a certificate infrastructure. Endpoints can always provide self-signed certificates.  However, this is problematic in that any endpoint can masquerade as another, by providing a self-signed certificate with the victim's information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.5">The reason CEMA mandates TLS in light of such an obvious vulnerability is three-fold.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.6">First, one of the target deployments for CEMA is the 3GPP IMS SIP network. In this environment it is trivially easy for the service provider to provide signed certificates or manage signed certificates on behalf of their subscribers. This does require trusting the service provider, but those issues are beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.7">Second, alternate key distribution mechanisms, such as <a href="#DANE">DANE</a> <cite title="NONE">[DANE]</cite>, <a href="#RFC6091">PGP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6091]</cite>, or some other technology may become ubiquitous enough to solve the key distribution problem.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.8">Third, experiences with IETF protocols have been that when security is put on as an afterthought or is optional, it rarely gets deployed.  There is a clear path over time for creating a key distribution mechanism. Thus mandating TLS at this time removes one of the recurring excuses to not deploy secure solutions build to Internet security norms. Namely, that one cannot deploy a secure solution because legacy endpoints do not have TLS capability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.9">Even with seemingly end-to-end media integrity, at the time of the publication of this document there are other vulnerabilities in MSRP that mean users may not have truly end-to-end security. These issues come from vulnerabilities in the SIP signaling. If there are no integrity protections on the SIP signaling, it is trivially easy for a bad actor to surreptitiously insert evil Middleboxes to alter, record, or otherwise harm the media. With insecure signaling, it can be very difficult for an endpoint to even be aware the remote endpoint has any relationship to the expected endpoint. Securing the SIP signaling does not solve all problems. For example, in a SIPS environment, the endpoints have no cryptographic way of validating that one or more SIP Proxies in the proxy chain are not, in fact, evil.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.10">In light of these vulnerabilities, why does CEMA mandate the more resource-intensive TLS instead of TCP for MSRP connections, and why does CEMA claim it has more security than deploying MSRP B2BUAs?</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.11">From a processing load perspective, the burden of TLS falls entirely on the endpoints. CPU capability and battery life of even low-end mobile devices are such that this is no longer a barrier for mandating TLS. Moreover, as an added bonus, CEMA removes the requirement for Middleboxes to decode, read, rewrite, and re-encrypting MSRP media. This means that Middleboxes can have much more scale and performance with CEMA.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.12">From a framework perspective, the ubiquitous deployment of TLS, while to totally ensuring integrity in all cases, does enable the environment for further end-to-end integrity solutions. For example, one could envision mechanisms where the endpoints create security associations in the MSRP media stream. This, coupled with future end-to-end integrity protected or assured SIP signaling, will provide for true end-to-end MSRP integrity. By mandating TLS today, we eliminate the possibility of future downgrade attacks in light of more robust solutions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.13">This situation is comparable to <a href="#RFC4033">DNSSEC</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4033]</cite>. DNSSEC does not solve all DNS integrity issues, but it does create an environment that immediately solves some problems and lays the groundwork for future, more robust solutions.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.4">6.4.</a> Downgrade Attacks</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">In order to ensure interoperability, CEMA clients can chose to conenct to non-CEMA clients. Whilst CEMA clients must use TLS, the CEMA client may connect to a pre-CEMA, RFC 4975 client. Although RFC 4975 mandates the implementation of TLS, RFC 4975 does not mandate the usage of TLS. Therefore, a pre-CEMA client may chose to use only TCP.  In this case, in the name of interoperability, a CEMA client MAY use a standard RFC 4975 TCP connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.2">The security implication is that an evil client or middlebox could strip the CEMA information from the negotiation. In this case, the CEMA client would believe the other end when it claims not to implement TLS. CEMA clients SHOULD attempt to validate non-TLS requests via mechanisms such as by using secured signaling chanels, unless those mechansims are truly unavailable.</p>
