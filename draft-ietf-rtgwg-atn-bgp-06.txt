                      draft-ietf-rtgwg-atn-bgp-06

Abstract

   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is investigating
   mobile routing solutions for a worldwide Aeronautical
   Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol Services (ATN/IPS).
   The ATN/IPS will eventually replace existing communication services
   with an IPv6-based service supporting pervasive Air Traffic
   Management (ATM) for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC), Airline
   Operations Controllers (AOC), and all commercial aircraft worldwide.
   This informational document describes a simple and extensible mobile
   routing service based on industry-standard BGP to address the ATN/IPS
   requirements.

1.  Introduction

   The worldwide Air Traffic Management (ATM) system today uses a
   service known as Aeronautical Telecommunications Network based on
   Open Systems Interconnection (ATN/OSI).  The service is used to
   augment controller to pilot voice communications with rudimentary
   short text command and control messages.  The service has seen
   successful deployment in a limited set of worldwide ATM domains.

   The International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO] is now
   undertaking the development of a next-generation replacement for ATN/
   OSI known as Aeronautical Telecommunications Network with Internet
   Protocol Services (ATN/IPS).  ATN/IPS will eventually provide an

   IPv6-based [RFC8200] service supporting pervasive ATM for Air Traffic
   Controllers (ATC), Airline Operations Controllers (AOC), and all
   commercial aircraft worldwide.  As part of the ATN/IPS undertaking, a
   new mobile routing service will be needed.  This document presents an
   approach based on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271].

   Aircraft communicate via wireless aviation data links that typically
   support much lower data rates than terrestrial wireless and wired-
   line communications.  For example, some Very High Frequency (VHF)-
   based data links only support data rates on the order of 32Kbps and
   an emerging L-Band data link that is expected to play a key role in
   future aeronautical communications only supports rates on the order
   of 1Mbps.  Although satellite data links can provide much higher data
   rates during optimal conditions, like any other aviation data link
   they are subject to errors, delay, disruption, signal intermittence,
   degradation due to atmospheric conditions, etc.  The well-connected
   ground domain ATN/IPS network should therefore treat each safety-of-
   flight critical packet produced by (or destined to) an aircraft as a
   precious commodity and strive for an optimized service that provides
   the highest possible degree of reliability.

   The ATN/IPS is an IPv6-based overlay network configured over one or
   more Internetworking underlays ("INETs") maintained by aeronautical
   network service providers such as ARINC, SITA and Inmarsat.  Each
   INET comprises one or more "partitions" where all nodes within a
   partition can exchange packets with all other nodes, i.e., the
   partition is connected internally.  There is no requirement that any
   two INET partitions use the same IP protocol version nor have
   consistent IP addressing plans in comparison with other partitions.
   Instead, the ATN/IPS IPv6 overlay sees each partition as a "segment"
   of a link-layer topology manifested through a (virtual) bridging
   service known as "Spanning Partitioned Aeronautical Networks (SPAN)".
   Further discussion of the SPAN is found in the following sections of
   this document, with reference to [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis].

   Each aircraft connects to the ATN/IPS overlay via an Overlay
   Multilink Network (OMNI) Interface [I-D.templin-6man-omni-interface]
   configured over the aircraft's underlying physical and/or virtual
   access network interfaces.  The OMNI interface connects to a Non-
   Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) virtual link that spans the entire
   ATN/IPS.

   The ATN/IPS further assumes that each aircraft will receive an IPv6
   Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) that accompanies the aircraft wherever it
   travels.  ICAO is further proposing to assign each aircraft an entire
   /56 MNP for numbering its on-board networks.  ATCs and AOCs will
   likewise receive IPv6 prefixes, but they would typically appear in
   static (not mobile) deployments such as air traffic control towers,

   airline headquarters, etc.  Throughout the rest of this document, we
   therefore use the term "MNP" when discussing an IPv6 prefix that is
   delegated to any ATN/IPS end system, including ATCs, AOCs, and
   aircraft.  We also use the term Mobility Service Prefix (MSP) to
   refer to an aggregated prefix assigned to the ATN/IPS by an Internet
   assigned numbers authority, and from which all MNPs are delegated
   (e.g., up to 2^32 IPv6 /56 MNPs could be delegated from an IPv6 /24
   MSP).

   Connexion By Boeing [CBB] was an early aviation mobile routing
   service based on dynamic updates in the global public Internet BGP
   routing system.  Practical experience with the approach has shown
   that frequent injections and withdrawals of MNPs in the Internet
   routing system can result in excessive BGP update messaging, slow
   routing table convergence times, and extended outages when no route
   is available.  This is due to both conservative default BGP protocol
   timing parameters (see Section 6) and the complex peering
   interconnections of BGP routers within the global Internet
   infrastructure.  The situation is further exacerbated by frequent
   aircraft mobility events that each result in BGP updates that must be
   propagated to all BGP routers in the Internet that carry a full
   routing table.

   We therefore consider an approach using a BGP overlay network routing
   system where a private BGP routing protocol instance is maintained
   between ATN/IPS Autonomous System (AS) Border Routers (ASBRs).  The
   private BGP instance does not interact with the native BGP routing
   systems in underlying INETs, and BGP updates are unidirectional from
   "stub" ASBRs (s-ASBRs) to a small set of "core" ASBRs (c-ASBRs) in a
   hub-and-spokes topology.  No extensions to the BGP protocol are
   necessary.

   The s-ASBRs for each stub AS connect to a small number of c-ASBRs via
   dedicated high speed links and/or tunnels across the INET using
   industry-standard encapsulations (e.g., Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE) [RFC2784], IPsec [RFC4301], etc.).  In particular, tunneling
   must be used when neighboring ASBRs are separated by multiple INET
   hops.

   The s-ASBRs engage in external BGP (eBGP) peerings with their
   respective c-ASBRs, and only maintain routing table entries for the
   MNPs currently active within the stub AS.  The s-ASBRs send BGP
   updates for MNP injections or withdrawals to c-ASBRs but do not
   receive any BGP updates from c-ASBRs.  Instead, the s-ASBRs maintain
   default routes with their c-ASBRs as the next hop, and therefore hold
   only partial topology information.

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS                   June 2020


   The c-ASBRs connect to other c-ASBRs within the same partition using
   internal BGP (iBGP) peerings over which they collaboratively maintain
   a full routing table for all active MNPs currently in service within
   the partition.  Therefore, only the c-ASBRs maintain a full BGP
   routing table and never send any BGP updates to s-ASBRs.  This simple
   routing model therefore greatly reduces the number of BGP updates
   that need to be synchronized among peers, and the number is reduced
   further still when intradomain routing changes within stub ASes are
   processed within the AS instead of being propagated to the core.  BGP
   Route Reflectors (RRs) [RFC4456] can also be used to support
   increased scaling properties.

   When there are multiple INET partitions, the c-ASBRs of each
   partition use eBGP to peer with the c-ASBRs of other partitions so
   that the full set of MNPs for all partitions are known globally among
   all of the c-ASBRs.  Each c/s-ASBR further configures a "SPAN
   address" which is taken from a global or unique-local IPv6 "SPAN
   prefix" assigned to each partition, as well as static forwarding
   table entries for all other prefixes in the SPAN.  The SPAN addresses
   are used for nested encapsulation where the inner IPv6 packet is
   encapsulated in a SPAN header which is then encapsulated in an IP
   header specific to the INET partition.

   The remainder of this document discusses the proposed BGP-based ATN/
   IPS mobile routing service.

2.  Terminology

   The terms Autonomous System (AS) and Autonomous System Border Router
   (ASBR) are the same as defined in [RFC4271].

   The following terms are defined for the purposes of this document:

   Air Traffic Management (ATM)
      The worldwide service for coordinating safe aviation operations.

   Air Traffic Controller (ATC)
      A government agent responsible for coordinating with aircraft
      within a defined operational region via voice and/or data Command
      and Control messaging.

   Airline Operations Controller (AOC)
      An airline agent responsible for tracking and coordinating with
      aircraft within their fleet.

   Aeronautical Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol
   Services (ATN/IPS)

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS                   June 2020


      A future aviation network for ATCs and AOCs to coordinate with all
      aircraft operating worldwide.  The ATN/IPS will be an IPv6-based
      overlay network service that connects access networks via
      tunneling over one or more Internetworking underlays.

   Internetworking underlay ("INET")
      A wide-area network that supports overlay network tunneling and
      connects Radio Access Networks to the rest of the ATN/IPS.
      Example INET service providers for civil aviation include ARINC,
      SITA and Inmarsat.

   (Radio) Access Network ("ANET")
      An aviation radio data link service provider's network, including
      radio transmitters and receivers as well as supporting ground-
      domain infrastructure needed to convey a customer's data packets
      to outside INETs.  The term ANET is intended in the same spirit as
      for radio-based Internet service provider networks (e.g., cellular
      operators), but can also refer to ground-domain networks that
      connect AOCs and ATCs.

   partition (or "segment")
      A fully-connected internal subnetwork of an INET in which all
      nodes can communicate with all other nodes within the same
      partition using the same IP protocol version and addressing plan.
      Each INET consists of one or more partitions.

   Spanning Partitioned Aeronautical Networks (SPAN)
      A virtual layer 2 bridging service that presents a unified link
      view to the ATN/IPS overlay even though the underlay may consist
      of multiple INET partitions.  The SPAN is manifested through
      nested encapsulation in which IPv6 packets from the ATN/IPS are
      first encapsulated in SPAN headers which are then encapsulated in
      INET headers.  In this way, packets sent from a source can be
      conveyed over the SPAN even though there may be many underlying
      INET partitions in the path to the destination.

   SPAN Autonomous System
      A "hub-of-hubs" autonomous system maintained through peerings
      between the core autonomous systems of different SPAN partitions.

   Core Autonomous System Border Router (c-ASBR)
      A BGP router located in the hub of the INET partition hub-and-
      spokes overlay network topology.

   Core Autonomous System
      The "hub" autonomous system maintained by all c-ASBRs within the
      same partition.

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS                   June 2020


   Stub Autonomous System Border Router (s-ASBR)
      A BGP router configured as a spoke in the INET partition hub-and-
      spokes overlay network topology.

   Stub Autonomous System
      A logical grouping that includes all Clients currently associated
      with a given s-ASBR.

   Client
      An ATC, AOC or aircraft that connects to the ATN/IPS as a leaf
      node.  The Client could be a singleton host, or a router that
      connects a mobile or fixed network.

   Proxy
      An ANET/INET border node that acts as a transparent intermediary
      between Clients and s-ASBRs.  From the Client's perspective, the
      Proxy presents the appearance that the Client is communicating
      directly with the s-ASBR.  From the s-ASBR's perspective, the
      Proxy presents the appearance that the s-ASBR is communicating
      directly with the Client.

   Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)
      An IPv6 prefix that is delegated to any ATN/IPS end system,
      including ATCs, AOCs, and aircraft.

   Mobility Service Prefix (MSP)
      An aggregated prefix assigned to the ATN/IPS by an Internet
      assigned numbers authority, and from which all MNPs are delegated
      (e.g., up to 2**32 IPv6 /56 MNPs could be delegated from a /24
      MSP).

3.  ATN/IPS Routing System

   The ATN/IPS routing system comprises a private BGP instance
   coordinated in an overlay network via tunnels between neighboring
   ASBRs over one or more underlying INETs.  The overlay does not
   interact with the underlying INET BGP routing systems, and only a
   small and unchanging set of MSPs are advertised externally instead of
   the full dynamically changing set of MNPs.

   Within each INET partition, one or more s-ASBRs connect each stub AS
   to the INET partition core using a shared stub AS Number (ASN).  Each
   s-ASBR further uses eBGP to peer with one or more c-ASBRs.  All
   c-ASBRs are members of the INET partition core AS, and use a shared
   core ASN.  Globally-unique public ASNs could be assigned, e.g.,
   either according to the standard 16-bit ASN format or the 32-bit ASN
   scheme defined in [RFC6793].

   The c-ASBRs use iBGP to maintain a synchronized consistent view of
   all active MNPs currently in service within the INET partition.
   Figure 1 below represents the reference INET partition deployment.
   (Note that the figure shows details for only two s-ASBRs (s-ASBR1 and
   s-ASBR2) due to space constraints, but the other s-ASBRs should be
   understood to have similar Stub AS, MNP and eBGP peering
   arrangements.)  The solution described in this document is flexible
   enough to extend to these topologies.

   MNPs and withdraws departed MNPs in its eBGP updates to c-ASBRs.
   Since ATN/IPS end systems are expected to remain within the same stub
   AS for extended timeframes, however, intra-domain mobility events
   (such as an aircraft handing off between cell towers) are handled
   within the stub AS instead of being propagated as inter-domain eBGP
   updates.

   Each c-ASBR configures a black-hole route for each of its MSPs.  By
   black-holing the MSPs, the c-ASBR will maintain forwarding table
   entries only for the MNPs that are currently active, and packets
   destined to all other MNPs will correctly incur ICMPv6 Destination
   Unreachable messages [RFC4443] due to the black hole route.  (This is
   the same behavior as for ordinary BGP routers in the Internet when
   they receive packets for which there is no route available.)  The
   c-ASBRs do not send eBGP updates for MNPs to s-ASBRs, but instead
   originate a default route.  In this way, s-ASBRs have only partial
   topology knowledge (i.e., they know only about the active MNPs
   currently within their stub ASes) and they forward all other packets
   to c-ASBRs which have full topology knowledge.

   The core ASes of each INET partition are joined together through
   external BGP peerings.  The c-ASBRs of each partition establish
   external peerings with the c-ASBRs of other partitions to form a
   "core-of-cores" SPAN AS.  The SPAN AS contains the global knowledge
   of all MNPs deployed worldwide, and supports ATN/IPS overlay
   communications between nodes located in different INET partitions by
   virtue of SPAN encapsulation.  Figure 2 shows a reference SPAN
   topology.

   Scaling properties of this ATN/IPS routing system are limited by the
   number of BGP routes that can be carried by the c-ASBRs.  A 2015
   study showed that BGP routers in the global public Internet at that
   time carried more than 500K routes with linear growth and no signs of
   router resource exhaustion [BGP].  A more recent network emulation
   study also showed that a single c-ASBR can accommodate at least 1M
   dynamically changing BGP routes even on a lightweight virtual
   machine.  Commercially-available high-performance dedicated router
   hardware can support many millions of routes.

   Therefore, assuming each c-ASBR can carry 1M or more routes, this
   means that at least 1M ATN/IPS end system MNPs can be serviced by a
   single set of c-ASBRs and that number could be further increased by
   using RRs and/or more powerful routers.  Another means of increasing
   scale would be to assign a different set of c-ASBRs for each set of
   MSPs.  In that case, each s-ASBR still peers with one or more c-ASBRs
   from each set of c-ASBRs, but the s-ASBR institutes route filters so
   that it only sends BGP updates to the specific set of c-ASBRs that
   aggregate the MSP.  In this way, each set of c-ASBRs maintains
   separate routing and forwarding tables so that scaling is distributed

   across multiple c-ASBR sets instead of concentrated in a single
   c-ASBR set.  For example, a first c-ASBR set could aggregate an MSP
   segment A::/32, a second set could aggregate B::/32, a third could
   aggregate C::/32, etc.  The union of all MSP segments would then
   constitute the collective MSP(s) for the entire ATN/IPS, with
   potential for supporting many millions of mobile networks or more.

   In this way, each set of c-ASBRs services a specific set of MSPs, and
   each s-ASBR configures MSP-specific routes that list the correct set
   of c-ASBRs as next hops.  This design also allows for natural
   incremental deployment, and can support initial medium-scale
   deployments followed by dynamic deployment of additional ATN/IPS
   infrastructure elements without disturbing the already-deployed base.
   For example, a few more c-ASBRs could be added if the MNP service
   demand ever outgrows the initial deployment.  For larger-scale
   applications (such as unmanned air vehicles and terrestrial vehicles)
   even larger scales can be accommodated by adding more c-ASBRs.

4.  ATN/IPS (Radio) Access Network (ANET) Model

   (Radio) Access Networks (ANETs) connect end system Clients such as
   aircraft, ATCs, AOCs etc. to the ATN/IPS routing system.  Clients may
   connect to multiple ANETs at once, for example, when they have both
   satellite and cellular data links activated simultaneously.  Clients
   configure an Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interface
   [I-D.templin-6man-omni-interface] over their underlying ANET
   interfaces as a connection to an NBMA virtual link that spans the
   entire ATN/IPS.  Clients may further move between ANETs in a manner
   that is perceived as a network layer mobility event.  Clients could
   therefore employ a multilink/mobility routing service such as those
   discussed in Section 7.

   Clients register all of their active data link connections with their
   serving s-ASBRs as discussed in Section 3.  Clients may connect to
   s-ASBRs either directly, or via a Proxy at the ANET/INET boundary.

   Figure 3 shows the ATN/IPS ANET model where Clients connect to ANETs
   via aviation data links.  Clients register their ANET addresses with
   a nearby s-ASBR, where the registration process may be brokered by a
   Proxy at the edge of the ANET.

                    Figure 3: ATN/IPS ANET Architecture

   When a Client logs into an ANET it specifies a nearby s-ASBR that it
   has selected to connect to the ATN/IPS.  (Selection of a nearby
   s-ASBR could be through consulting a geographically-keyed static host
   file, through a DNS lookup, through a network query response, etc.)
   The login process is transparently brokered by a Proxy at the border
   of the ANET, which then conveys the connection request to the s-ASBR
   via tunneling across the SPAN.  The s-ASBR then registers the address
   of the Proxy as the address for the Client, and the Proxy forwards
   the s-ASBR's reply to the Client.  If the Client connects to multiple
   ANETs, the s-ASBR will register the addresses of all Proxies as
   addresses through which the Client can be reached.

   The s-ASBR represents all of its active Clients as MNP routes in the
   ATN/IPS BGP routing system.  The s-ASBR's stub AS therefore consists
   of the set of all of its active Clients (i.e., the stub AS is a
   logical construct and not a physical construct).  The s-ASBR injects

   the MNPs of its active Clients and withdraws the MNPs of its departed
   Clients via BGP updates to c-ASBRs, which further propagate the MNPs
   to other c-ASBRs within the SPAN AS.  Since Clients are expected to
   remain associated with their current s-ASBR for extended periods, the
   level of MNP injections and withdrawals in the BGP routing system
   will be on the order of the numbers of network joins, leaves and
   s-ASBR handovers for aircraft operations (see: Section 6).  It is
   important to observe that fine-grained events such as Client mobility
   and Quality of Service (QoS) signaling are coordinated only by
   Proxies and the Client's current s-ASBRs, and do not involve other
   ASBRs in the routing system.  In this way, intradomain routing
   changes within the stub AS are not propagated into the rest of the
   ATN/IPS BGP routing system.

5.  ATN/IPS Route Optimization

   ATN/IPS end systems will frequently need to communicate with
   correspondents associated with other s-ASBRs.  In the BGP peering
   topology discussed in Section 3, this can initially only be
   accommodated by including multiple tunnel segments in the forwarding
   path.  In many cases, it would be desirable to eliminate extraneous
   tunnel segments from this "dogleg" route so that packets can traverse
   a minimum number of tunneling hops across the SPAN.  ATN/IPS end
   systems could therefore employ a route optimization service according
   to the mobility service employed (see: Section 7).

   A route optimization example is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 below.
   In the first figure, multiple tunneled segments between Proxys and
   ASBRs are necessary to convey packets between Clients associated with
   different s-ASBRs.  In the second figure, the optimized route tunnels
   packets directly between Proxys without involving the ASBRs.

6.  BGP Protocol Considerations

   The number of eBGP peering sessions that each c-ASBR must service is
   proportional to the number of s-ASBRs in its local partition.
   Network emulations with lightweight virtual machines have shown that
   a single c-ASBR can service at least 100 eBGP peerings from s-ASBRs
   that each advertise 10K MNP routes (i.e., 1M total).  It is expected
   that robust c-ASBRs can service many more peerings than this -
   possibly by multiple orders of magnitude.  But even assuming a
   conservative limit, the number of s-ASBRs could be increased by also
   increasing the number of c-ASBRs.  Since c-ASBRs also peer with each
   other using iBGP, however, larger-scale c-ASBR deployments may need
   to employ an adjunct facility such as BGP Route Reflectors
   (RRs)[RFC4456].

   The number of aircraft in operation at a given time worldwide is
   likely to be significantly less than 1M, but we will assume this

   number for a worst-case analysis.  Assuming a worst-case average 1
   hour flight profile from gate-to-gate with 10 service region
   transitions per flight, the entire system will need to service at
   most 10M BGP updates per hour (2778 updates per second).  This number
   is within the realm of the peak BGP update messaging seen in the
   global public Internet today [BGP2].  Assuming a BGP update message
   size of 100 bytes (800bits), the total amount of BGP control message
   traffic to a single c-ASBR will be less than 2.5Mbps which is a
   nominal rate for modern data links.

   Industry standard BGP routers provide configurable parameters with
   conservative default values.  For example, the default hold time is
   90 seconds, the default keepalive time is 1/3 of the hold time, and
   the default MinRouteAdvertisementinterval is 30 seconds for eBGP
   peers and 5 seconds for iBGP peers (see Section 10 of [RFC4271]).
   For the simple mobile routing system described herein, these
   parameters can be set to more aggressive values to support faster
   neighbor/link failure detection and faster routing protocol
   convergence times.  For example, a hold time of 3 seconds and a
   MinRouteAdvertisementinterval of 0 seconds for both iBGP and eBGP.

   Instead of adjusting BGP default time values, BGP routers can use the
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol [RFC5880] to
   quickly detect link failures that don't result in interface state
   changes, BGP peer failures, and administrative state changes.  BFD is
   important in environments where rapid response to failures is
   required for routing reconvergence and, hence, communications
   continuity.

   Each c-ASBR will be using eBGP both in the ATN/IPS and the INET with
   the ATN/IPS unicast IPv6 routes resolving over INET routes.
   Consequently, c-ASBRs and potentially s-ASBRs will need to support
   separate local ASes for the two BGP routing domains and routing
   policy or assure routes are not propagated between the two BGP
   routing domains.  From a conceptual and operational standpoint, the
   implementation should provide isolation between the two BGP routing
   domains (e.g., separate BGP instances).

7.  Stub AS Mobile Routing Services

   Stub ASes maintain intradomain routing information for mobile node
   clients, and are responsible for all localized mobility signaling
   without disturbing the BGP routing system.  Clients can enlist the
   services of a candidate mobility service such as Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
   [RFC6275], LISP [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] and AERO
   [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis] according to the service offered by the
   stub AS.  Further details of mobile routing services are out of scope
   for this document.

8.  Implementation Status

   The BGP routing topology described in this document has been modeled
   in realistic network emulations showing that at least 1 million MNPs
   can be propagated to each c-ASBR even on lightweight virtual
   machines.  No BGP routing protocol extensions need to be adopted.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not introduce any IANA considerations.

10.  Security Considerations

   ATN/IPS ASBRs on the open Internet are susceptible to the same attack
   profiles as for any Internet nodes.  For this reason, ASBRs should
   employ physical security and/or IP securing mechanisms such as IPsec
   [RFC4301], TLS [RFC5246], etc.

   ATN/IPS ASBRs present targets for Distributed Denial of Service
   (DDoS) attacks.  This concern is no different than for any node on
   the open Internet, where attackers could send spoofed packets to the
   node at high data rates.  This can be mitigated by connecting ATN/IPS
   ASBRs over dedicated links with no connections to the Internet and/or
   when ASBR connections to the Internet are only permitted through
   well-managed firewalls.

   ATN/IPS s-ASBRs should institute rate limits to protect low data rate
   aviation data links from receiving DDoS packet floods.

   BGP protocol message exchanges and control message exchanges used for
   route optimization must be secured to ensure the integrity of the
   system-wide routing information base.

   This document does not include any new specific requirements for
   mitigation of DDoS.

Appendix A.  BGP Convergence Considerations

   Experimental evidence has shown that BGP convergence time required
   for when an MNP is asserted at a new location or withdrawn from an
   old location can be several hundred milliseconds even under optimal

   AS peering arrangements.  This means that packets in flight destined
   to an MNP route that has recently been changed can be (mis)delivered
   to an old s-ASBR after a Client has moved to a new s-ASBR.

   To address this issue, the old s-ASBR can maintain temporary state
   for a "departed" Client that includes a SPAN address for the new
   s-ASBR.  The SPAN address never changes since ASBRs are fixed
   infrastructure elements that never move.  Hence, packets arriving at
   the old s-ASBR can be forwarded to the new s-ASBR while the BGP
   routing system is still undergoing reconvergence.  Therefore, as long
   as the Client associates with the new s-ASBR before it departs from
   the old s-ASBR (while informing the old s-ASBR of its new location)
   packets in flight during the BGP reconvergence window are
   accommodated without loss.
