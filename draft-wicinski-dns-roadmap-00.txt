   A Document Roadmap for the Doman Name System (DNS) Specifications
                     draft-wicinski-dns-roadmap-00

Abstract

   This document contains a roadmap to the Requests for Comments (RFC)
   documents relating to the Domain Name System (DNS).  This roadmap
   provides a brief summary of the documents defining DNS and the
   various extensions.  This serves as a guide and quick reference for
   DNS Implementers, as well as others.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical piece of communication for
   Internet hosts.  As DNS has evolved over the years, many distinct
   documents have become part of the standard, updating older documents
   either partially or completely.

   This document is intended as an introduction to DNS, and also an
   attempt to organize the work from over the years.  It provides a
   brief summary of the RFC documents that define DNS.  This should be
   useful to implementers and others on the relevance and significance
   of the work that relate to DNS.

   This roadmap includes a brief description of the contents of each
   DNS-related RFC.  In addition, a letter code after each RFC indicates
   its category in the RFC document process.  The explanations of these
   codes are described in [RFC2026].

   S - Standards Truck (either Proposed Standard, Draft Standard or
   Internet Standard)

   E - Experimental

   I - Informational

   H - Historic

   B - Best Current Practice

Internet-Draft                 DNS Roadmap                  October 2016


   U - Unknown (or not formally defined)

   The DNS consists of multiple portions which could be implemented.
   These parts are (but are not restricted to): an Authorative Server
   (which includes managing the storage of zone data) and a Caching
   Server.

   The roadmap is broken up into several sections.  Section 2 decribes
   the core functionality.  Section 3 lists the RFCs which are required
   to implement a DNS Server Section 3.1 lists the DNS Resource Record
   (RR) Types nees Section 4 discusses managing DNS zone data and
   updating DNS Zones Section 5 covers DNS Security (DNSSEC), how to
   implmenet it.

   Experimental extensions which are not yet standard track, as well as
   documents which help to document behavior of the DNS but are not
   required are in Section 6.  Current Best Practices are described in
   Section 7.

   For the definition of DNS terms or phrases, please refer to the DNS
   Terminology document [RFC7719]

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  DNS Terminology

   [RFC7719] I: "DNS Terminology"

   Since the DNS has been defined in dozens of different RFC over
   several decades, the terminology used by developers, implementors and
   operators of the DNS protocol sometimes changed over time.  This
   document captured how terms were defined in the original standards,
   and if they have different meanings today.

2.  Core Functionality and Specifications

   [RFC1034] U: "Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities"

   [RFC1035] S: "Domain Names - Implementation and Specification"

   [RFC2181] S: "Clarifications to the DNS Specification"
