                    Remote Hub Status and Definition
                    draft-elkins-ietf-remote-hubs-00


   Abstract

   Remote IETF hubs seem to be springing up organically in quite a few
   regions.  There appear to be regional differences in how hubs are
   organized.  Latin America has quite a few remote hubs as does India.
   The two regions are different in how they arose, where they meet, and
   what they do.

   Thus, creating a template for a remote hub may not work because hubs
   may be very different across cultures and of very different sizes. 

   Lastly, this document discusses how IETF "central" can assist with
   remote hubs.

1 Background

   Remote IETF hubs seem to be springing up organically in quite a few
   regions.  There appear to be regional differences in how hubs are
   organized.  Latin America has quite a few remote hubs as does India. 
   The two regions are different in how they arose, where they meet, and
   what they do.

   Thus, creating a template for a remote hub may not work because hubs
   may be very different across cultures and of very different sizes. 

   Lastly, this document discusses how IETF "central" can assist with
   remote hubs.

2 Definition and goals

2.1 What is a remote hub?

   A remote hub can be anything where more than one person gathers to
   listen / participate in IETF sessions.  It can be as simple as
   someone's living room to major hubs with 7 rooms, telepresence and
   many people in each.  Such large remote hubs do not actually exist at
   this point - but they could in the future.

   It is NOT necessarily an entire set of IETF sessions viewed in real
   time.  A remote hub for a full IETF meeting may not be practical. A
   remote hub for a working group or a few sessions may work better, at
   least in the beginning.

   The hubs should be self-sustaining and organize themselves -- that
   is, not necessarily driven by a central group. 

2.2 Goals for remote hubs

   1.  People who regularly attend IETF cannot always do so because of
   financial constraints.  Remote hubs can be one solution.

   2.  People who WANT to be involved in IETF and have some level of
   support (ex. in Latin America, India, etc) with an ongoing group who
   can help prepare for the WG session(s).    These people would attend
   actual IETF meetings, if they could afford it, but they can't - so
   they go to a remote hub.

   3.  There are many valuable people in the academic world who could
   participate and are doing potentially relevant work but do not know 
   much about IETF.   Here, support and an ongoing group first needs to
   be built who can help prepare for the WG session(s).    These people
   down the road may want to attend actual IETF meetings, but to start,

INTERNET DRAFT         elkins-ietf-remote-hubs-00          March 9, 2016


   may want to go to a remote hub.

   This actually applies to the start-up community as well.  One of the
   authors of this document was contacted by a Silicon Valley developer
   doing sensor development.  In the future, he wanted to be involved in
   the ROLL Working Group.   He could not afford to attend live.  This
   is a common situation for many in the start-up world.  They are doing
   innovative work and would bring implementation knowledge and
   creativity to the IETF but often cannot afford to attend IETF
   meetings in person.  If there were an option to be involved in a
   remote hub in Silicon Valley, it is likely that quite a few people
   would take advantage of that.

2.3 Advantages of remote hubs

   1.Not everyone can come to the meetings.   Provide that experience.  

   2. A remote hub can help to create local communities.   Building
   related communities may be a very important benefit.  

   3. Remote hubs may increase participation.  This is a very important
   benefit.

   4. There may be topics of local interest. 

   5. The remote hub can continue to work outside of the IETF meetings.
   

   6. A remote hub should be a better experience than attending remotely
   alone.    Provides a group of interested individuals or community
   with opportunities for networking.  

2.4 Drawbacks of remote hubs

   1. What if the quality of the network connection is poor?   If I have
   important work to do, I may just attend from home where I can better
   control the connection.

   2. What if others do not want to attend the same sessions that I do?
   

   3. This is logistically a complicated deal.   Need space or
   conference room for the hub. 

   4. Time zone can be quite challenging

2.5 Questions about remote hubs

   1. What if interest in a given hub spans many tracks??  Especially if
   simultaneous session demand exists.  Between 5-7 rooms may be needed
   to cover various areas. Should there be a hub and "Spoke" arrangement
   for different rooms/interests? 

   2. Will people travel within their country (air and hotel) as a
   "cheaper' alternative to traveling internationally? 

   3. Why would people travel domestically any significant distance,
   rather than just set up another remote location?

   4. How far should we expect someone to travel to a remote hub?  
   Should staying overnight be assumed viable?  

   5. Would someone travel to the remote hub for just one session?  May
   need to schedule so that everyone at that hub would attend two or
   three consecutive sessions to make the travel worthwhile.

   6. Scheduling across time zones could be an issue,  especially if
   time zone of meeting is Asia.  Can remote hubs use recordings and
   watch together to address time zone differences.  

   7. Can remote hubs be a viable alternative for ACTIVE participants?  
    What about a chair or director? 	

   8. Does IETF sponsor any remote hubs?     

   9. Can remote hubs approach the experience of attending the
   meetings?

   10. Is there a cost to participate in a IETF meeting at a remote hub?
     Physical meeting attendees pay $800, will remote hub attendees have
   any expenses?  	 

   11. Are there any costs involved in running a remote hub?  

   12. Is any training or certification needed to be a hub?  

3 Remote hubs by region

3.1 Remote hubs in Latin America

   Latin America has many remote hubs and plans for many more.  They are
   organic and may be quite small with only a few individuals interested
   in a particular topic.  The first remote hub was in the Hawaii IETF
   with 50 people attending from hubs.   In Dallas IETF, there were 100

INTERNET DRAFT         elkins-ietf-remote-hubs-00          March 9, 2016


   - 200 people and 20 hubs.   

   They haven't spent any money at all. Many don't even have a
   projector. Just a PC.   Having 3-4 people discussing is more
   interesting than attending a meeting by themselves.

3.2 Remote hubs in India

   India has 23 hubs and over 500 members participating remotely at
   large universities as a part of the Indian IETF Capacity Building
   (IICB) program.  The web site www.IICB.org has been set up with more
   information on this.


4 IETF central support of remote hubs

4.1 Web site

   Web pages to get information out about remote hubs and what they are
   covering, schedules and other details/logistics.  

4.2 Email lists

   Potentially providing emails lists.

4.3 Regional hosts

   Maybe regional hosts are needed.

5 IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

6 Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
