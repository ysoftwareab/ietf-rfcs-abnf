   3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
   [RFC2571].  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
   for the purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure
   of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
   16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
   [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].  Message protocols for transferring management
   information.  The first version of the SNMP message protocol is
   called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second
   version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet
   standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
   [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
   protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC
   2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].  Protocol operations for
   accessing management information.  The first set of protocol
   operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
   1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations and associated
   PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].  A set of fundamental
   applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based
   access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   4.  Introduction

       The purpose of this memo is to define a supplemental set of managed
       objects that is not covered by ADSL Line MIB as defined in [RFC2662].
       This memo addresses the additional objects defined in ITU G.997.1.
       These additional objects specifically address the management

   5.  Relationship of the ADSL LINE EXTENSION MIB with standard MIBs

       This section outlines the relationship of ADSL Line Extension MIB
       with other MIBs described in RFCs and in their various degrees
       of "standardization".  ADSL Line Extension MIB obeys the same
       relationship between ADSL Line MIB to other standard MIBs with
       one exception for the ifOperStatus as defined in RFC 1213.

   5.1 ifOperStatus

       ifOperStatus is set to down(2) when the ADSL line interface is in
       power state L3, which means no power.  ifOperStatus is set to up(1)
       if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 (power on)
       or L1 (reduced power).

   6.  Conventions used in the MIB

   6.1  Structure

   The MIB is organized to follow the same structure of the ADSL Line
   MIB [RFC2662].

   6.2  Additional Managed Objects

   A few objects are added to cover the ADSL "Lite" management and they are:

      - ATU-C Transmission System and Line Mode
      - Power Management
      - Counters for Fast Retrains and Failed Fast Retrains
      - Counters for Severe Error Second-line and Unavailable Second
      - Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode interface

      Besides the management of ADSL "Lite", another object has been added
      to the ADSL Line MIB [RFC2662] in order to manage the ADSL line profile.
      The object is the line mode configuration.

      The MIB definitions are attached. The MIB will be branched from the
      ADSL Line MIB [RFC2662].

   6.2.1 ATU-C ADSL Transmission System Parameters and Line Mode

   The adslLineConfigTable needs to be extended to cover control of the
   ATU-C ADSL Transmission system.  Three objects are defined to monitor
   and configure the transmission mode as well as the actual line mode:

        - Capability
        - Configuration
        - Actual Status

INTERNET-DRAFT           ADSL Line Extension MIB           April 9, 2001


   Transmission modes can further determine the line mode of the ADSL
   interface.  For example, if g9921PotsNonOverlapped(2) is the actual
   value of the ADSL interface, the interface is operating in Full rate
   ADSL.  If the interface is set to g9922PotsOverlapped(9), the interface
   is operating in G.lite mode.

   The transmssion mode and the corresponding line mode are defined as:

        Transmission mode                        Line Mode
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Regional Std. (ANSI T1.413)               Full
        Regional Std. (ETSI DTS/TM06006)          Full
        G.992.1 POTS non-overlapped               Full
        G.992.1 POTS overlapped                   Full
        G.992.1 ISDN non-overlapped               Full
        G.992.1 ISDN overlapped                   Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN non-overlapped           Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN overlapped               Full
        G.992.2 POTS non-overlapped               Lite
        G.992.2 POTS overlapped                   Lite
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN non-overlapped      Lite
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN overlapped          Lite
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN symmetric                Full

                     Table 1: Transmission Mode and Line Mode

   In case more than one bit is configured for an ADSL interface and
   both Full and Lite modes are selected, the interface is said to
   configure in the dual mode.  Only one bit can be set in the Actual
   object that reflects the actual mode of transmission as well as the
   line mode.

   6.2.2 Power Management

   There are three power states for each managed ADSL interface operating
   in the G.lite mode.  L0 is power on, L1 is power on but reduced and L3
   is power off.  Power state cannot be configured by an operator but it
   can be viewed via the ifOperStatus object for the managed ADSL interface.
   The value of the object ifOperStatus is set to down(2) if the ADSL
   interface is in power state L3 and is set to up(1) if the ADSL line
   interface is in power state L0 or L1.

   An ADSL line power state, if the interface is operating in the G.lite
   mode, can also be monitored by the adslLineGlitePowerState object
   defined in the ADSL Line Extension table.  The value of the object
   enumerates the three power states attainable by the managed interface.

   6.2.3 Fast Retrain Parameters

INTERNET-DRAFT           ADSL Line Extension MIB           April 9, 2001


   Section 7.4.15 of ITU G.997.1 specifies fast retrain parameters.  Fast
   retrain parameters include two counters: fast retrain count and failed
   fast retrain count.  These two counters have been added to all
   performance tables.

   6.2.4 Counters for Severe Error Second-line and Unavailable Second

   Section 6.2.1.1.7 and section 6.2.1.1.9 specify two counters that are
   not covered by the ADSL Line MIB [RFC2662].  These two counters
   (severe error seconds-line and unavailable seconds) are added
   to all the performance tables.

   Unavailable seconds counts cumulative number of seconds in which the
   interface was unavailable during the measured period.  This counter
   does not include the seconds in which unavailability was caused solely
   by fast retrains and failed fast retrins.  Fast retrains and failed
   fast retrains are considered to be part of the normal network operation
   and thus are not counted as unavailable errors.

   6.2.5 Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode interface

   This object is used only when the interface (for the ADSL line or
   channel) is configured as dual mode, that is, the object
   adslLineTransAtucConfig is configued with one or more full-rate
   modes and one or more Lite modes.

   The object adslLineConfProfile defined in ADSL-MIB [RFC2662] is used as
   the primary full-rate profile.  The newly added object in this MIB
   module, adslLineConfProfileDualLite is used to describe or configure
   the Lite profile.  Note that if one or more full-rate modes are
   configured, or only lite modes are configured, only the original
   full-rate profile is needed.  The dual-mode profile object is only
   needed when both full-rate and lite profiles are needed.

   If the static profile is used, the profile name is the ifIndex ASCII
   string plus the differentiator string appended to the end of the
   static profile name.  For example, for interface 100, the object
   adslLineConfProfile is set by the agent to be "100Full" and the
   object adslLineConfProfileDualLite is set to be "100Lite".

   module.

   11.  Security Considerations

      1) Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL MIB via the element
      management system is outside the scope of this document. It should be
      noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to
      modify the profiles (sect 6.4) such that both subscriber service and
      network operations can be interfered with. Subscriber service can be
      altered by modifying any of a number of service characteristics such
      as rate partitioning and maximum transmission rates. Network
      operations can be impacted by modification of trap thresholds such as

      SNR margins.

      2) There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
      considered to contain sensitive information.  In particular, the
      certain objects may be considered sensitive in many environments,
      since it would allow an intruder to obtain information about which
      vendor's equipment is in use on the network.  Therefore, it may be
      important in some environments to control read access to these
      objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
      sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP
      provide features for such a secure environment.

      SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
      network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
      access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.  It is recommended
      that the implementors consider the security features as provided by
      the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-based
      Security Model RFC 2574 [21] and the View-based Access Control Model
      RFC 2575 [23] is recommended.

      It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
      entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
      configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
      (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

      3) ADSL layer connectivity from the ATU-R will permit the subscriber
      to manipulate both the ADSL link directly and the AOC/EOC channels
      for their own loop.  For example,  unchecked or unfiltered
      fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient
      traps to potentially overwhelm either the management interface to the
      network or the element manager.  Other attacks affecting the ATU-R
      portions of the MIB may also be possible.
