1. Introduction 
   
  Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS from 
  supporting Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching to 
  include support of four new classes of interfaces and switching: 
  Layer 2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time Division Multiplex Capable (TDM), 
  Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber Switch Capable (FSC) [1]. GMPLS 
  signaling specification [1] presents a functional description of the 
  extensions to MPLS signaling needed to support these new classes of 
  interfaces and switching. GMPLS Signaling such as RSVP-TE extensions 
  [2] and CR-LDP extensions [3] includes the specific formats and 
  mechanisms to support four classes of interfaces.  
   
  In MPLS, a label is a short, fixed length, locally significant 
  identifier which is used to identify a Forwarding Equivalence Class 
  (FEC). The label which is put on a particular packet represents the 
  FEC to which that packet is assigned [4]. This label value does not 
  necessarily imply a relationship to bandwidth or characteristics 
  (e.g., frequency band, time slot information, etc) data flows. On the 
  other hand, in GMPLS, to deal with the widening scope of MPLS into 
  the optical and time domain, several new forms of "label" are 
  required. These new forms of label are collectively referred to as a 
  "Generalized Label".  
   
  In GMPLS, the meanings of label are different from each other and 
  MUST be identify data flows with several switching type. Therefore, 
  the specific label encoding rule for each interface MUST be specified. 
  At present, the encoding rules for MPLS label and TDM label are 
  defined in related specifications [5],[6],[7]. In GMPLS-based optical 
  network, we SHOULD consider the multiple granularities that label 
  represents. So in GMPLS with heterogeneous interfaces, data flows 
  with small bandwidth needs to be aggregated in fiber and/or 
  wavelength with large bandwidth. In this case, a Label Switched Path 
  (LSP) such as lambda LSP and fiber LSP includes several kinds of 
  labels. At present, label format for optical interface such as 
  wavelength and fiber is defined but the specific mapping rule doesn't 
  be defined. Therefore, it is very important to specify the label 
  mapping rule that is taken optical characteristic into consideration 
  and manage the label with a different granularity.  
   
  To support GMPLS, in this draft, we describe the relationship of 
  labels and resources. We also discuss the resource mapping methods 
  for GMPLS with heterogeneous interfaces. Particularly we present the 
  methods for resource mapping at incoming and outgoing switching 
  interface where data flows with label of a different granularity are 
  aggregated into the data flow of large bandwidth. Using this rule, we

  can control and manage data flows with several labels (e.g., 
  different resources) inside GMPLS control domain.

  Carrying label information on a given link depends on the switching 
  capability of interface between the ends of the link [11]. The 
  relationship of labels and switching interfaces is shown in Figure 1.

  ends of links. However, for heterogeneous interface, data flows with 
  labels of switching interfaces at ingress point of link are

  aggregated into data flow with a label of switching interface with 
  large bandwidth at egress point of link. 
   
   
2.2. Generalized label and switching interface 
   
  o Label for packet switch capable (PSC) 
   
  Packet Switch Capable (PSC) interface can switch the received data on 
  a packet-by-packet basis. This interface recognizes packet/cell 
  boundaries and can forward data based on the content of the 
  packet/cell header. The label carried in the "shim" header [5] is 
  used in this interface. We define all kinds of label used in PSC 
  interface as "MPLS label". 
   
   - MPLS label represents a generic MPLS label, a Frame Relay label, 
     or an ATM label. Generic MPLS labels and Frame Relay labels are 
     encoded right justified aligned in 32 bits (4 octets)[1].  
   
  o Label for Time Division Multiplex Capable (TDM) 
   
  Time Division Multiplex Capable (TDM) interface forwards data based 
  on the data's time slot in a repeating cycle. TDM interface can 
  multiplex or demultiplex channels within a frame such as SDH payload. 
  The followings are the descriptions of label for TDM. 
   
    - SONET/SDH label identifies the exact position (i.e. first time-
      slot) of a particular VTx SPE, STS-x SPE or VC-x signal in a 
      multiplexing structure [6]. Multiplexing structure for SONET/SDH 
      is based on ANSI [8]/ITU-T G.707 recommendations [9].  
  
    - In G.709 optical transport network, G.709 label identifies the 
      exact position of a particular ODUj signal in an ODUk multiplexing 
      structure. Multiplexing structures are based on ITU-T G.709 
      recommendation [7], [10],[15].  
   
  o Label for Lambda Switch Capable(LSC) and Fiber Switch Capable(FSC)  
   
  Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) interface forwards data based on the 
  wavelength on which the data is received. Therefore, this interface 
  can recognize and switch individual lambdas within the interface. An 
  example of such an interface is an Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) switch 
  that can operate at the level of an individual wavelength. The 
  followings are the descriptions of label for Lambda Switch Capable 
  (LSC). 
   
    - lambda label represents a single wavelength within a waveband (or 
      fiber). 
      
    - waveband label represents a set of contiguous wavelengths which 
      can be switched together to a new waveband. So, this label 
      represents a single wavelength within a waveband (or fiber).

     Note: in waveband switching, the switching interface can recognize 
     and switch individual waveband within the link (without 
     distinguishing lambda, channels or packets). 
   
  Fiber Switch Capable (FSC) interface forward data based on a position 
  of the data in the real world physical spaces. Therefore, this 
  interface can switch the entire contents to another interface 
  (without distinguishing lambdas, channels or packets). Fiber 
  switching system switches at the granularity of an entire interface, 
  and can not exact individual lambdas within the interface. This 
  interface uses port label. 
   
    - port label represents a single fiber in a bundle 
   
   
3. Resource Hierarchy with Multiple Granularities 
 
3.1. Resource hierarchy in GMPLS 
   
  In GMPLS-based optical network, the functionality to simultaneously 
  switch different levels of granularity inside a given network can be 
  supported. Therefore, GMPLS resource has a hierarchical architecture. 
   
  The resource hierarchy of GMPLS is shown in Figure 2. At the top of 
  the hierarchy are nodes that do fiber switching using port label of 
  Fiber Switch Capable (FSC) interfaces. Underneath are nodes that do 
  OXC switching using lambda (waveband) label of Lambda Switch Capable 
  (LSC) interfaces, followed by TDM time slot switching such as SONET, 
  SDH and ADM using SONET/SDH label of Time Division Multiplex Capable 
  (TDM) interfaces, and finally, nodes that do packet switching using 
  MPLS label of Packet Switch Capable (PSC) interfaces. See [12] for 
  more information on the concept of GMPLS resource hierarchy. 
   
  The data flows that have MPLS shim header are transferred through a 
  packet LSP that originates between two packet switches. The data 
  flows are aggregated in TDM switch such as SONET and SDH. The 
  aggregated data flows with new SONET/SDH label are multiplexed inside 
  a TDM time slot LSP between two TDM switches. Similarly, the 
  multiplexed data flows with new lambda (waveband) label can be 
  transferred inside a lambda LSP that originates between two lambda 
  switches. Finally the data flows with new port label can be 
  transferred inside a fiber LSP that originates between two fiber 
  switches. Reversely, these data flows MUST be recovered in lower 
  switching interface using label information. Therefore, using GMPLS 
  signaling each switching interface determines the label value to use 
  and keeps the mapping information between label and data flow. In 
  particular, when each data flow with small bandwidth is aggregated 
  into a data flow with large bandwidth, ingress and egress switching 
  interface SHOULD know the information that data flows are aggregated 
  and de-aggregated in a synchronous and/or asynchronous manner for 
  sharing resource (i.e., wavelength etc), see Section 4.

3.2. The relationship of labels and resources 
   
  Labels are defined in GMPLS to provide information on the resources    
  used on link local basis for a particular connection. The labels may    
  range from specifying a particular timeslot, a particular wavelength    
  to a particular port/fiber. The idea of a label can be generalized to 
  be anything that is sufficient to identify a traffic flow. Therefore, 
  labels have different granularity. As shown in Figure 3, in optical 
  fiber whose bandwidth is divided into wavebands and wavelengths, the 
  whole of one wavelength could be allocated to a requested flow. The 
  switching nodes at either end of the fiber simply have to agree on 
  which frequency to use.

4. Resource Mapping Scenario for GMPLS 
 
4.1. Aggregation in optical switching interface 
   
  Let consider the case that data flows with label of a different 
  granularity are aggregated into the data flow of large bandwidth in 
  optical switching interface such as LSC and FSC. Figure 4 represents 
  a simple example of aggregation in OXC with LSC. Each switch performs 
  aggregation and de-aggregation for the purpose of sharing optical 
  resources. These flows may be aggregated in a synchronous or/and 
  synchronous manner of time domain according to switching schemes. 
  Similar to label stacking concept, several flows with label are 
  stacked. For TDM, label can represent the allocated time slot of the 
  TDM hierarchy in use. Otherwise, each switching interface SHOULD have 
  mapping information that each flow is located at a certain point of 
  optical resource (e.g., wavelength etc). Therefore, mapping and 
  aggregation rule for implementation SHOULD be defined (see section 
  4.2).

4.2. Logical resource aggregation using label association 
   
  In GMPLS, the label value directly implies the bandwidth that is 
  available for the corresponding data flow. For example, if a label 
  denotes a single SONET VC-4 timeslot, the available bandwidth is the 
  bandwidth of a VC-4 timeslot; similarly for other TDM labels and 
  lambda, waveband or fiber labels. 
   
  The scope of the label value is considered local to each 
  corresponding node. To reserve bandwidth with different granularity, 
  each node performs logical resource aggregation using label 
  association to map the incoming label into outgoing label. This 
  function includes the followings 
   
  - mapping the ID (e.g., incoming label) used at incoming switching 
    interface to the ID (e.g., outgoing label) used at its outgoing 
    switching interface 
  - aggregating sets of IDs (e.g., incoming labels) at incoming 
    switching interface into the corresponding link ID (e.g., outgoing 
    label) 
   
  Logical resource aggregation may be considered in the following cases. 
   
  - MPLS flows to TDM time slot  
  - MPLS flows to wavelength  
  - Wavelengths to waveband  
  - Wavebands to fiber  
   
  Note) logical resource de-aggregation will be applied to the reverse 
  cases. 
   
  Figure 5 shows the illustration of logical resource aggregation using 
  label association information. For instance, node 1's incoming data 
  flows of each wavelength may be mapped onto node 1's outgoing 
  waveband. Thus a waveband includes three wavelengths. Similarly, node 
  2's incoming data flows of each waveband may be mapped onto node 2's 
  outgoing fiber. This function is similar to wavelength concatenation 
  and label merging mechanism.

4.3. Traffic parameter mapping  
   
  In GMPLS, traffic flows from different edge node are to be mapped 
  into different bandwidth trunks established with specific traffic 
  parameters. Each node performs traffic parameter mapping between 
  incoming and outgoing links through GMPLS signaling such as RSVP-TE 
  [2], CR-LDP [3]. 
   
  For MPLS flows, the data rate of flows can be corresponded to the 
  following traffic parameters of peak rate (e.g., peak data rate(PDR), 
  peak burst size (PBR)) to represent the bursty characteristic of data 
  flow. 
   
  For TDM time slot such as SONET/SDH, the dedicated bandwidth 
  according to container size is determined. In this case, traffic 
  parameter which represents constant data rate can be mapped.  
   
  For optical interface, in case of waveband and fiber, we can know the 
  precise capacity of them according to the capacity of a lambda. 
  Traffic parameter of constant data rate can be applied to these 
  resources. However, when a lambda shares the resource with several 
  data flows, the precise capacity of lambda resource may not be 
  specified. 
   
              
5. Additional Considerations for Resource Mapping

5.1. Unnumbered link and link bundling 
   
  Support of unnumbered link [13] has been introduced to address the 
  scalability issues of assigning IP address to earn link of an optical 
  switch. This is because the link of an optical switch may correspond 
  to a fiber, lambda, or even TDM channel, depending on the switching 
  granularity of the link. This reduces the management effort in 
  configuring IP addresses and tracking allocated IP addresses, 
  especially with optical network having large numbers of links. 
   
  Link bundling [14] can be used to aggregate multiple parallel links 
  into a single "bundled link" for IGP scaling purposes. This is 
  important for optical networks, as hundreds of parallel fibers will 
  be developed between switches and each fiber may obtain hundreds of 
  wavelengths.  
   
                           bundled link 
       component link 1   +------------+(component interfaces) 
       -------------------|------------|---------------------- 
       component link 2   |            | 
       -------------------|------------|---------------------- 
       ... ... ... ...    |  ... ...   | ... ... ... ... 
       component link n   |            | 
       -------------------|------------|---------------------- 
                          +------------+ 
   
                Figure 6. bundled link and component link 
   
  In GMPLS, we MAY consider to represent unnumbered link and link 
  bundling as "label". To control these resources, each node SHOULD 
  have all mapping information related to bundled links and component 
  links shown in Figure 6. 
   
   
5.2. Label stacking 
   
  The traditional MPLS supports label stacking that is a more general 
  model in which a labeled packet carries a number of labels, organized 
  as a last-in, first-out stack [4]. This concept can be applied to the 
  GMPLS resource hierarchy, but GMPLS cannot support label stacking 
  operation. Thus in GMPLS network with multiple resource granularities, 
  similar mechanism corresponding to label stacking SHOULD be provided.  
 
 
5.3. Protection and restoration 
   
  Survivability (e.g., protection and restoration), the ability of a 
  network to withstand and recover from failures, is one of the most 
  important requirements of networks. In GMPLS with concatenation LSP 
  segments, resource information of LSP and/or link for recovery 
  including SRLG (Shared Risk Link Groups) is needed. Thus, it is

  necessary to define the resource mapping procedure for applying to 
  various protection and restoration mechanisms.

  requirements using this document are described in the referenced
