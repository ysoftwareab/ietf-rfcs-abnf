Abstract

   This document defines a YANG model for managing flexi-grid optical 
   Networks. The model described in this document is composed of two
   submodels: one to define a flexi-grid traffic engineering database,
   and other one to describe the flexi-grid paths or media channels.

1. Introduction

   Internet-based traffic is dramatically increasing every year.
   Moreover, such traffic is also becoming more dynamic. Thus,
   transport networks need to evolve from current DWDM systems towards
   elastic optical networks, based on flexi-grid transmission and
   switching technologies. This technology aims at increasing both
   transport network scalability and flexibility, allowing the
   optimization of bandwidth usage.

   This document presents a YANG model for flexi-grid objects in the

Internet-Draft   A YANG data model for Flexi-Grid    March 2016


   dynamic optical network, including the nodes, transponders and links 
   between them, as well as how such links interconnect nodes and 
   transponders.
   
   The YANG model for flexi-grid [RFC7698] networks allows the 
   representation of the flexi-grid optical layer of a network, combined 
   with the underlying physical layer. The model is defined in two YANG 
   modules:

   o Flexi-grid-TED (Traffic Engineering Database): This module defines
      all the information needed to represent the flexi-grid optical 
      node, transponder and link.

   o Media-channel: This module defines the whole path from a source
      transponder to the destination through a number of intermediate
      nodes in the flexi-grid optical network.

   This document identifies the flexi-grid components, parameters and 
   their values, characterizes the features and the performances of the
   flexi-grid elements. An application example is provided towards the
   end of the document to better understand their utility.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.

3. Flexi-grid network topology model overview

   YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration data
   manipulated by the NETCONF protocol. Several YANG models have already
   been specified for network configurations. For instance, the work in 
   [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] has proposed a YANG model of
   a TED, but only covering the IP layer. A YANG model has also been 
   proposed in [I-D.draft-dharini-netmod-g-698-2-yang] to configure
   flexi-grid DWDM parameters. 

   As stated before, we propose a model to describe an flexi-grid 
   topology that is split in two YANG sub-modules:


Lopez de Vergara, et al.    Expires August 28, 2016      [Page 3]
Internet-Draft   A YANG data model for Flexi-Grid    March 2016


   o Flexi-grid-TED: In order to be compatible with existing 
     proposals, we augment the definitions contained in 
     [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo], by defining the
     different elements we find in an flexi-grid network: a node, a
     transponder and a link. For that, each of those elements is
     defined as a container that includes a group of attributes.
     References to the elements are provided to be later used in the
     definition of a media channel. It also includes the data types for
     the type of modulation, the flexi-grid technology, the FEC, etc.
   o Media-channel: This module defines the whole path from a source
     transponder to the destination through a number of intermediate
     nodes and links. For this, it takes the information defined before
     in the flexi-grid TED. 
     
     The following section provides a detailed view of each module.

   filters, switching matrices...);

   Optical Tributary Signal. In the model, the network media channel 
   has as end-points transponders, which are the source and 
   destination of the optical signal. The description of these 
   components is provided below:

5. Example of use

   In order to explain how this model is used, we provide the following
   example. An optical network usually has multiple transponders,

   switches (nodes) and links between them. Figure 1 shows a simple
   topology, where two physical paths interconnect two optical
   transponders.

                      Figure 1. Topology example.

   In order to configure a media channel to interconnect transponders A
   and E, first of all we have to populate the flexi-grid TED YANG model
   with all elements in the network:

   1. We define the transponders A and E, including their FEC type, if
      enabled, and modulation type. We also provide node identifiers
      and addresses for the transponders, as well as interfaces
      included in the transponders. Sliceable transponders can also be
      defined if needed.

   2. We do the same for the nodes B, C and D, providing their
      identifiers, addresses and interfaces, as well as the internal
      connectivity matrix between interfaces.

   3. Then, we also define the links 1 to 5 that interconnect nodes and
      transponders, indicating which flexi-grid labels are available. 
      Other information, such as the slot frequency and granularity are
      also provided.

Internet-Draft   A YANG data model for Flexi-Grid    March 2016


   Next, we can configure the media channel from the information we
   have stored in the flexi-grid TED, by querying which elements are
   available, and planning the resources that have to be provided on
   each situation. Note that every element in the flexi-grid TED has a
   reference, and this is the way in which they are called in the media
   channel.

   4. Depending on the case, it is possible to define either the source
      and destination node ports, or the source and destination node
      and transponder. In our case, we would define a network media
      channel, with source transponder A and source node B, and
      destination transponder E and destination node C. Thus, we are
      going to follow path x.

   5. Then, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we
      are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what
      nodes are connected.

   Finally, the flexi-grid TED has to be updated with each element 
   usage status each time a media channel is created or torn down.

6. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].

7. Security Considerations

   The transport protocol used for sending the managed information MUST
   support authentication and SHOULD support encryption.

   The defined data-model by itself does not create any security
   implications.


8. IANA Considerations

   The namespace used in the defined models is currently based on the
   IDEALIST project URI. Future versions of this document could
   register a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688], as well as in the
   YANG Module Names registry [RFC6020].
