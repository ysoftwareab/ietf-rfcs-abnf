                     Introduction to the FYI Notes

Abstract

      This document updates the first For Your Information (FYI)
      document and begins the practice of using FYI 1 as the
      well-known place to lookto determine the status of the
      documents in the FYI series.  The FYIs are a subseries of the
      Request For Comments.

Status of This Memo

      This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance
      with all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

      Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet
      Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working
      groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute working
      documents as Internet-Drafts.

      Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
      months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
      documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-
      Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as
      "work in progress."

      To view the list Internet-Draft Shadow Directories, see
      http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html.

Introduction

      This document explains what the FYI series of documents is, what
      format and content rules they must follow, and how they are
      reviewed. It also lists all the FYIs published to date and
      gives the current status of each.

Internet Draft                FYI on FYIs                  February 1999


Acknowledgments

      The authors wish to acknowledge the writers of the first
      version of this FYI, Joyce K. Reynolds and Gary Malkin.  We
      also wish to recognize the authors of each of the FYI
      documents for their work and contributions to the FYI
      subseries.  The User Services Working Group provided
      invaluable input and feedback into drafts of this information.
      Joyce K. Reynolds kindly reviewed the sections that describe
      formatting documents and submitting them to the RFC Editor.
      Lastly, we would like to acknowledge Jon Postel for his
      support of this series and for his guidence regarding good and
      better methods for indicating the status of existing FYIs.

Background

      The FYI series of notes is designed to provide Internet
      users with a central repository of information about any topics
      that relate to the Internet.  FYI topics may range from
      historical memos on "why it was was done this way" to answers
      to commonly asked operational questions.

      The FYIs are intended for a wide audience.  Some FYIs will
      cater to beginners, while others will discuss more advanced
      topics.  An FYI may be submitted by anyone who has something
      to contribute and has the time to do so.

      FYIs are a subseries of the Request For Comments (RFC)
      documents.  Each FYI is also an RFC and carries both an FYI
      number and an RFC number.  There are several reasons why the
      FYIs are part of the larger RFC series of notes.  The foremost
      reason is that the distribution mechanisms for RFCs are tried
      and true.  Anyone who can get an RFC, can automatically get an
      FYI.  More importantly, anyone who knows of the RFC series,
      can easily find out about the FYIs.

Format Rules

      Since the FYIs are a part of the RFC series, they must conform
      to RFC 2223, "Instructions to RFC Authors," with respect to
      format and inclusion of required sections.  Required sections
      include one discussing Security Considerations, a Status
      section, a Copyright section, and the author's contact
      information.  Please review RFC 2223 before submitting an FYI.

Internet Draft                FYI on FYIs                  February 1999


Relation to other FYIs

      Sometimes an FYI adds information on a topic discussed in a
      previous FYI or completely replaces an earlier FYI.  There are
      two terms used for these cases respectively, UPDATES and
      OBSOLETES.  A document that obsoletes an earlier document can
      stand on its own.  A document that merely updates an earlier
      document cannot stand on its own; it is something that must be
      added to or inserted into the existing document, and has
      limited usefulness independently.  You do not need to consult
      the earlier document if the document you have obsoletes it,
      but you do need the earlier document if your document merely
      updates the earlier one it refers to.

      For example, this FYI now both updates and obsoletes various
      other FYIs be cause it contains additional information about
      some, and lets you know that others should no longer be
      consulted.

      This document obsoletes RFC 1150, the original FYI 1.
      However, its FYI number does not change.  As new FYIs are
      written that update or obsolete existing ones, they will keep
      the same FYI number.  This allows readers to understand that
      FYI 1, for example, will always have the latest information
      about the FYI series as a whole and FYI 4 will always have
      information for new Internet users, etc.  Each version of an
      FYI, however, will have a unique RFC number.  The RFC Index
      will show the updates/obsoletes/updated-by/obsoleted-by
      relationships of the FYIs (as it does with other RFCs).

      The RFC Index is available on many RFC repository hosts,
      including
      ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc-index.txt. There is an
      index of just the FYI subseries as well, which can be found at
      ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/fyi-index.txt.

The FYI Editors

      All FYIs are submitted to the IETF User Services Working Group
      for review prior to their publication by the RFC Editor.

      Documents written by working groups within the User Services
      Area of the IETF will be referred to the RFC Editor by the
      Area Director and the Internet Engineering Steering Group; the
      authors do not need to submit directly to the RFC Editor.

      If a document did not originate within the IETF, it may be
      submitted to the RFC Editor via email to

      rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org.  If you indicate that you wish a
      document published as an FYI or if the RFC Editor feels a
      document should be considered for FYI status, the Editor will
      refer the document to the User Services Working Group of the
      Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) by alerting
      the User Services Area Director.  Information about the IETF
      can be found at http://www.ietf.org/.

Security Considerations

      This memo discusses the administrative status of the FYI
      series of documents rather than any operational feature of the
