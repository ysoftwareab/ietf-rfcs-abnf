                 draft-ploumhans-avtcore-rtp-colibri-00

Abstract

   This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the Colibri Video 
   "Standard".  This document describes the transport of Colibri video
   in RTP packets and has applications for low-complexity, 
   high-bandwidth streaming of lossy compressed video.

   The Colibri Video is intended for low latency video compression 
   (with latency potentially on the order of lines of video) at high 
   to medium data rates (with compression ratios betwen 2:1 and 20:1).

Internet-Draft             Colibri RTP Payload              October 2021

1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies an RTP payload format for the Colibri video 
   coding.

   The Colibri codec is a wavelet-based codec intended primarily for 
   professional video use with high bit-rates and low to medium levels 
   of compression.  It has been designed to be low-complexity, and 
   potentially have a very low latency through both encoder and decoder: 
   with some choices of parameters this latency may be as low as a few 
   lines of video.

   The low level of complexity in the Colibri codec allows for this low 
   latency operation but also means that it lacks many of the more 
   powerful compression techniques used in other codecs.  As such it is 
   suitable for low compression ratios that produce coded data rates 
   around half to a quarter of that of uncompressed video, at a similar 
   visual quality. In some applications, the compression ratio can be 
   increased up to 20.

   The primary use for Colibri is likely to be in professional video 
   production environments and "screen content".

2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Media Format Description

   The Colibri specification defines a Colibri stream as being composed 
   of one or more Frames.  Each Frame contains all of the needed 
   parameters and metadata for configuring the decoder.

   Each Frame consists of a Colibri header, a Colibri Parameters segment
   and a sequence of slices, describing a picture.  Each picture 
   represents a frame in a progressively scanned video Sequence or a 
   field in an interlaced video Sequence.

   Each slice in a Colibri frame can be coded either as an intra slice 
   (not using information from a previous frame) or as an inter slice 
   (using information on the same slice position of previously coded 
   Colibri frames).  A Colibri encoder will normally force the encoding 
   of each slice to intra regularly, so that a decoder can accumulate 
   information over several frames and be able to display a complete 
   valid frame after some time.

   At time of writing there is no specific definition of padding or 
   auxiliary data for the Colibri codec. Padding is always possible in 
   the Colibri Parameters segement or in a Colibri slice, but is not 
   specifically seperated from the useful payload.

   The Colibri Parameters segment contains all the parameters required 
   to set up the Colibri decoder for the next picture.

   Each Slice represents a rectangular region of the transformed 
   picture.  Slices within a picture may vary in coded length, but all 
   represent the same shape and size of rectangle in the picture.

4.  Payload format

   This section specifies the payload format for Colibri streams over 
   the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].

4.1. RTP Packetization

   This specification provides two different transmission modes of the 
   Colibri pictures over RTP.

   The first transmission mode is called the "picture packetization"
   mode. In this mode, one Colibri picture is transmitted as a single 
   packetization unit, split over several RTP packets, which are the 
   Picture packets. This is illustrated in Figure 1.


   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #1  | Hdr | Optional Headers + Colibri stream (part 1) |
   Picture    +-----+--------------------------------------------+

   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #2  | Hdr | Colibri stream (part 2)                    |
   Picture    +-----+--------------------------------------------+

   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #3  | Hdr | Colibri stream (part 3)                    |
   Picture    +-----+--------------------------------------------+
      ...       ...

   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #N  | Hdr | Colibri stream (part N)                    |
   Picture    +-----+--------------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft             Colibri RTP Payload              October 2021

   The second transmission mode is called the "slice packetization"
   mode.  In this mode, one Colibri picture is split into several RTP 
   packets.  The first RTP packet for the Colibri picture is the Headers
   Packet and contains all the header and parameters information. The 
   remaining RTP packets are the Slice Packets and will contain one or 
   more Colibri slices.  A Colibri slice may not be split accross more 
   than one RTP packet.  Colibri slices that are not horizontally 
   aligned MAY NOT be part of the same RTP packet.

   This is illustrated in Figure 2, where NS(x) is the number of slices 
   of the Colibri picture transmitted over RTP packets 1 to x. 

   In addition to the Headers Packets and the Slice Packets, this RTP 
   specification defines the Padding Packets and the Auxiliary Packets, 
   which allow the transport of padding and auxiliary data, for the 
   Slice packetization mode only.


   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #1  | Hdr | Optional Headers + Colibri header          |
   Headers    +-----+--------------------------------------------+

   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #2  | Hdr | Colibri slices 0 to NS(2)-1                |
   Slices     +-----+--------------------------------------------+

   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #3  | Hdr | Colibri slices NS(2) to NS(3)-1            |
   Slices     +-----+--------------------------------------------+

      ...       ...

   RTP        +-----+--------------------------------------------+
   Packet #N  | Hdr | Colibri slices NS(N-1) to NS(N)-1          |
   Slices     +-----+--------------------------------------------+

4.2. RTP Packets for Colibri

   The structure of an RTP Packet for Colibri is illustrated in 
   Figure 3.

   All fields in the headers longer than a single bit are interpreted 
   as unsigned integers in network byte order.

   The fields of the RTP header have the following additional notes on 
   their usage:

Internet-Draft             Colibri RTP Payload              October 2021

   Marker Bit (M): 1 bit  The marker bit MUST be set on any packet which
   contains the final slice in a coded picture and MUST NOT be set 
   otherwise.

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits  A dynamically allocated payload type field
   that designates the payload as Colibri coded video.

   Timestamp: 32 bits  The timestamp corresponds to the sampling instant
   of the coded picture.  A 90kHz clock SHOULD be used.  A single RTP 
   packet MUST NOT contain coded data for more than one coded picture, 
   so there is no ambiguity here.

   The remaining RTP header fields are used as specified in RTP 
   [RFC3550].

4.3.  Payload Header

   This document defines five types of RTP packets in a Colibri media 
   stream:
   
    - A Colibri Picture Packet, containing a portion of a Colibri 
      Picture in Picture Packetization mode
    - A Colibri Headers Packet, containing optional headers and the 
      Colibri header in Slice Packetization mode
    - A Colibri Slices Packet, containg at least one Colibri slice in 
      Slice Packetization mode
    - An Auxiliary data Packet, containing data auxiliary to a Colibri 
      Picture, but not actually part of the Colibri stream, in Slice 
      Packetization mode.
    - A Padding Packet, containing irrelevant data, which is not part of
      the Colibri stream, in Slice Packetization mode.

   The fields of the first 4 bytes of the Payload header are defined as 
   follows:

   C : 1 bit  MUST be set to 1 if the Payload header must be extended by 
   32 additional bits.
   
   T : 1 bit  Indicates the packTization mode. MUST be set to 0 for the 
   Picture packetization mode.

   D : 1 bit  Indicates that the payload contains an optional Video 
   Definition header.  When the Packet counter is 0, the Video 
   Definition header may be included prior to the optional Color 
   Specification header and the Colibri Header.  When the Packet counter
   is not 0, the D bit MUST be set to 0.

   Specification header.  When the Packet counter is 0, the Color 
   Specification header may be included prior to the Colibri Header.  
   When the Packet counter is not 0, the A bit MUST be set to 0.

   I : 1 bit  Indicates whether the Video transmitted over RTP is 
   interlaced or progressive.  The value of I must be set to 1 when the 
   video is interlaced.  The value of P must be set to 0 when the video 
   is progressive.

   Pict Count : 7 bits  Indicates the picture number modulo 128.  In the
   case of interlaced video, the LSbit of the Pict Count field indicates 
   the field number.  The first field of a frame always has an even 
   Picture Count, and the second field of a frame always has an odd 
   Picture Count.

   Packet Count : 20 bits  Indicates the Packet number within the 
   current Colibri Picture.  It is set to 0 at the start of the Colibri 
   Picture, and is incremented by 1 for every Colibri Picture Packet 
   that belongs to the same Colibri Picture.

   A Colibri Picture Packet is identified by the value of the T field, 
   which must be set to 0.

   If the value of the C field is 1, the payload header is extended by 
   32 bits :

   C : 1 bit  MUST be set to 1 if the Payload header must be extended by
   32 additional bits.

   Extended Packet Count : 31 bits  The Packet Count is extended by 31 
   bits.

   The Payload header (and the Packet Count) may be extended 
   indefinitely.

   T : 1 bit  Indicates the packTization mode. MUST be set to 1 for the 
   Slice packetization mode.

   D : 1 bit  Indicates that the payload contains an optional Video 
   Definition header.  When F is 1, the Video Definition header may be 
   included prior to the optional Color Specification header and the 
   Colibri Header.  When F is 0, the D bit has another meaning.

   A : 1 bit  Indicates that the payload contains an optional Color 
   Specification header.  When F is 1, the Color Specification header 
   may be included prior to the Colibri Header.  When F is 0, the A bit 
   has another meaning.

   I : 1 bit  Indicates whether the Video transmitted over RTP is 
   interlaced or progressive.  The value of I must be set to 1 when the 
   video is interlaced.  The value of P must be set to 0 when the video 
   is progressive.

   F : 1 bit  Indicates the First packet of the Colibri picture.  F Must 
   be set to 1 for the Colibri Headers Packet, and must be set to 0 for 
   any other packet in Slice packetization mode.

4.4.  Stream Constraints

   There are some constraints which a Sequence needs to conform to in 
   order to be transmissible with this specification.
   o  In Picture packetization mode, the optional Video Definition 
      header and the optional Color Specification headers combined 
      SHOULD be small enough that the RTP packet carrying it will fit 
      within the network MTU size.
   o  In Slice packetization mode, the optional Video Definition header, 
      the optional Color Specification headers and the Colibri 
      Parameters segment SHOULD be small enough that the RTP packet 
      carrying it will fit within the network MTU size.
   o  In Slice packetization mode, every coded slice SHOULD be small 
      enough that the RTP packet carrying it will fit within the network 
      MTU size.

   Sending a Stream which does not meet the above requirements is not 
   possible unless the stream is re-encoded by a Colibri Encoder to meet 
   them.

4.5.  Payload Data

   In Picture packetization mode, the payload data for the first packet 
   must be the optional Video Definition header (if indicated in the 
   payload header), followed by the optional Color Specification header 
   (if indicated in the payload header), followed by the beginning of 
   the encoded Colibri Picture. The payload data for the other packets 
   in Picture packetization mode contain, in order, the next segment of 
   the encoded Colibri Picture. Segments must be sent in order.

   For the Colibri Headers Packet, the payload data must be the optional 
   Video Definition header (if indicated in the payload header), 
   followed by the optional Color Specification header (if indicated in 
   the payload header), followed by the Colibri Headers and the Colibri 
   Parameters exactly as it appears in the Colibri picture.

   For the Colibri Slices packet type the payload data MUST be a 
   specified number of coded slices in the same order that they appear 
   in the Colibri slice sequence.  All Colibri Slices packets may only 
   contain slices which have the same vertical position.  As a 
   consequence, the first Colibri Slices packet with a new value of 
   Slice Offset Y MUST have a value of Slice Offset X equal to 0.

4.5.1.  Reassembling the Data

   To reassemble the data in the RTP packets into a valid Colibri video 
   stream with Picture packetization mode:
   o  The receiver SHOULD take the payload data from each Colibri 
      Picture packet and remove the optional Video Definition header (if 
      present) and the optional Color Specification header (if present).

   To reassemble the data in the RTP packets into a valid Colibri video 
   stream with Slice packetization mode:
   o  The receiver SHOULD take the data from each Colibri Headers packet 
      and remove the optional Video Definition header (if present) and 
      the optional Color Specification header (if present).  The 
      resulting Colibri Header and Colibri Parameters MUST be included 
      in the output stream before any coded slice which followed it in 
      the RTP stream.
   o  The receiver SHOULD take the data from each Colibri Slices packet.
      The Colibri slices must be sent in the right order. If a Colibri 
      Slices packet is missing, the RTP receiver MUST provide a sequence 
      of replacement slices corresponding to the number of missing 
      slices.  The choice of what replacement slice will be is left to 
      the implementer to decide, but it is recommended to use either the 
      empty slice, as shown in Figure 16, or the reuse slice, as shown 
      in Figure 17.  In the case of the empty slice, the decoder will 
      erase the content of the previous slices and provide all 0 wavelet 
      coefficients, which will result in a grey area in the output 
      picture.  In the case of the reuse slice, the decoder will reuse 
      all the available content from the previous frame, as if the slice 
      was not modified between the previous and the current frame.
   o  The receiver can either discard or transmit to an auxiliary 
      channel the Colibri Auxiliray packets.
   o  The receiver SHOULD drop the Colibri Padding packets.

5.  Congestion Control Considerations

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550 
   [RFC3550], and with any applicable RTP profile; e.g., RFC 3551 
   [RFC3551].  An additional requirement if best-effort service is being 
   used is: users of this payload format MUST monitor packet loss to 
   ensure that the packet loss rate is within acceptable parameters.  
   Circuit Breakers [RFC8083] is an update to RTP [RFC3550] that defines 
   criteria for when one is required to stop sending RTP Packet Streams, 
   and applications implementing this standard MUST comply with it.  RFC 
   8085 [RFC8085] provides additional information on the best practices 
   for applying congestion control to UDP streams.

   In particular it should be noted that the expected data rate for RTP 
   sessions which use this profile is likely to be close to gigabits per 
   second.  If used on a closed network which has been correctly 
   provisioned for the expected data rates this might not pose a 
   problem, but there is always the risk of data getting out onto the 
   open internet.

6.  Payload Format Parameters

   This RTP payload format is identified using the video/colibri media
   type which is registered in accordance with RFC 4855 [RFC4855] and
   using the template of RFC 6838 [RFC6838].

6.2.  Mapping to SDP

   The mapping of the above defined payload format media type and its
   parameters SHALL be done according to Section 3 of RFC 4855
   [RFC4855].

   o  The type name ("video") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The subtype name ("colibri") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
      encoding name, followed by a slash ("/") and the rate parameter.

   o  The required parameter profile and the optional parameters version
      and level, when present, are included in the "a=fmtp" attribute
      line of SDP as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value
      pairs.

   Version and level SHALL be specified in decimal when present.

   For example, a sample SDP mapping for Colibri could be as follows:

             m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 112
             a=rtpmap:112 colibri/90000
             a=fmtp:112 profile=1;version=1;level=0

   In this example, a dynamic payload type 112 is used for colibri data.
   The 90 kHz RTP timestamp rate is specified in the "a=rtpmap" line
   after the subtype.  In the "a=fmtp:" line, profile 1, version 1, and
   level 0 (unknown or non-standard level) are specified.

6.3.  Offer/Answer Considerations

   All parameters are declarative.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA registers video/colibri as specified in
   Section 7.1.  The media type is also requested to be added to the 
   IANA registry for "RTP Payload Format MIME types"
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters).

8.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [RFC3550], and in any applicable RTP profile such as 
   RTP/AVP [RFC3551], RTP/AVPF [RFC4585], RTP/SAVP [RFC3711] or 
   RTP/SAVPF [RFC5124].  However, as "Securing the RTP Protocol 
   Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" 
   [RFC7202] discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility 
   to discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic 
   security goals like confidentiality, integrity and source 
   authenticity for RTP in general.  This responsibility lies with 
   anyone using RTP in an application.  They can find guidance on 
   available security mechanisms and important considerations in Options 
   for Securing RTP Sessions [RFC7201].  Applications SHOULD use one or 
   more appropriate strong security mechanisms.  The rest of this 
   security consideration section discusses the security impacting 
   properties of the payload format itself.

   This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit any 
   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational 
   complexity for packet processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a 
   denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological data. Nor 
   does the RTP payload format contain any active content.

   To avoid buffer overruns when processing these packets the receiver 
   MUST consider both the reported fragment length and the actual 
   received size of a packet containing slice data.

   In some cases the transmitter may need to decode fixed length coded 
   headers in order to extract some data from the Colibri bitstream 
   before assembling packets.  This process is potentially subject to 
   buffer overruns if not implemented carefully.

9.  RFC Editor Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor: This section may be removed after carrying out
   all the instructions of this section.

   RFCXXXX is to be replaced by the RFC number this specification
   receives when published.
