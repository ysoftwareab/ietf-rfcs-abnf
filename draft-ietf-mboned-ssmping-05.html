<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The Multicast Ping Protocol specified
in this document allows for checking whether an endpoint can receive
multicast, both Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) and Any-Source
Multicast (ASM). It can also be used to obtain additional multicast
related information like multicast tree setup time etc.
This protocol is based on an implementation of tools
called ssmping and asmping.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The Multicast Ping Protocol specified in this
document allows for checking multicast connectivity. In addition to
checking reception of multicast (SSM or ASM), the protocol can provide
related information like multicast tree setup time, the number of hops
the packets have traveled, as well as packet delay and loss.
This functionality resembles, in part, the ICMP Echo Request/Reply
mechanism, but uses UDP (<a class='info' href='#RFC0768'>RFC 768<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;User Datagram Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1980.</span><span>)</span></a> [2] and
<a class='info' href='#RFC2460'>RFC 2460<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S. and R. Hinden, &ldquo;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [3]) and requires both
a client and a server implementing this protocol.
Intermediate routers are not required to support this protocol. They
forward Protocol Messages and data traffic as usual.

</p>
<p>
The protocol here specified is based on the actual implementation of
the ssmping and asmping tools <a class='info' href='#impl'>[5]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;ssmping implementation,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> which are widely
used by the Internet community to conduct multicast connectivity tests.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Architecture</h3>

<p>Before describing the protocol in detail, we provide a brief
overview of how the protocol may be used and what information it may
provide. 
The typical protocol usage is as follows: A server
runs continuously to serve requests from clients. A client can
test the multicast reception from this server, provided it knows
a unicast address of the server. It will then send
a unicast message to the server asking for a group to use. Optionally
the user may have requested a specific group or scope, in which case
the client will ask for a group matching the user's request. The
server will respond with a group to use, or an error if no group is
available. Next, for ASM, the client joins an ASM group G, while for
SSM it joins a channel (S,G). Here G is the group specified by the
server, and S is the unicast address used to reach the server.

</p>
<p>
After joining the channel, the client unicasts multicast ping requests
to the server. The requests are sent using UDP with destination port set
to the standardised multicast ping port [TBD]. The requests are sent
periodically, e.g., once per second, to the server. The requests contain
a sequence number, and typically a timestamp. The requests are echoed
by the server, except the server may add a few options. For each
request, the server sends two replies.
One reply is unicast back to the source IP address and source UDP port of
the request, while another is multicast to the requested multicast
group G and the source UDP port of the request. Both replies are
sent from the same port on which the request was received.
The server
should specify the TTL used for both the unicast and multicast messages
(we recommend at least 64) by including a TTL option; allowing the client
to compute the number of hops. The client should leave the channel/group
when it has finished its measurements.

</p>
<p>By use of this protocol, a client can obtain information about
several multicast delivery characteristics. First, by receiving
unicast replies, it can verify that the server is receiving the
unicast requests, is operational and responding. Hence, provided that
the client receives unicast replies, a failure to receive multicast
indicates either a multicast problem or a multicast administrative
restriction. If it does receive multicast, it knows not only
that it can receive; it may also estimate the amount of time it took to
establish the multicast tree (at least if it is in the
range of seconds), whether there are packet drops, and the length
and variation of Round Trip Times (RTT). For unicast, the RTT is the
time from when the unicast request is sent to when the reply is received.
The measured multicast RTT also references the client's unicast
request. By use of the TTL option specifying the TTL of the replies when
they are originated, the client can also determine the number of router
hops it is from the source. Since similar information is obtained in
the unicast replies, the host may compare its multicast and unicast
results and is able to check for differences in the number of hops,
RTT, etc. The number of multicast hops and changes in the number of
hops over time, may also reveal details about the multicast tree and
multicast tree changes. E.g., with PIM-SM one may be able to tell
whether the forwarding is on a shared or source-specific tree and
when an eventual switch occurs. Provided that the server sends the unicast
and multicast replies nearly simultaneously, the client may also be able to
measure the difference in one way delay for unicast and multicast on the
path from server to client, and also differences in
delay. Servers may optionally specify a timestamp.
This may be useful since the unicast and multicast
replies can not be sent simultaneously (the delay depending on
the host's operating system and load).

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Protocol specification</h3>

<p>
There are four different message types. There are
Echo Request and Echo Reply messages used for the actual
measurements; there is an Init message that SHOULD be used to
initialise a ping session and negotiate which group to use;
and finally a Server Response message that is mainly used in
response to the Init message. The messages MUST always
be in network byte order. UDP checksums MUST always be used.

</p>
<p>
The messages share a common format: one octet
specifying the message type, followed by a number of options in
TLV (Type, Length and Value) format. This makes the protocol
easily extendible. The Init message generally contains some
prefix options asking the server for a group from one of the
specified prefixes. The server responds with a Server Response
message that contains the group address to use, or possibly
prefix options describing what multicast groups the server may
be able to provide.
For an Echo Request the client generally includes a number of
options, and a server MAY simply echo the contents (only
changing the message type) without inspecting the options if
it does not support any options. This might be true for a
simple Multicast Ping Protocol server.
However, the server SHOULD add a TTL option, and
there are other options that a server implementation MAY
support, e.g., the client may ask for certain information or a
specific behaviour from the server.
The Echo Replies (one unicast and one multicast) MUST first
contain the exact options from the request (in the same order),
and then, immediately following, any options appended by the server.
A server MUST NOT process unknown options, but they MUST still
be included in the Echo Reply. A client MUST ignore any unknown
options.

</p>
<p>
This document defines a number of different options. Some options
do not require processing by servers and are simply returned unmodified
in the reply. There are, however, other client options that the server
may care about, and also server options that may be requested by a
client.
Unless otherwise specified, an option MUST NOT be used multiple
times in the same message.

Defined Options</h3>

<p>This document defines the following options: Version (0),
Client ID (1), Sequence Number (2), Client Timestamp (3),
Multicast Group (4), Option Request Option (5),
Server Information (6), TTL (9), Multicast Prefix (10),
Session ID (11) and Server Timestamp (12). Values 7 and 8 are
reserved. The options are defined below.

</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Version, type 0
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
Length MUST be 1. This option MUST always be
included in all messages, and the value MUST be set to 2 (in decimal).
Note that there are older implementations of ssmping that only partly
follow this specification. They can be regarded as version 1 and do
not use this option. If a server receives a message with a version
other than 2 (or missing), the server SHOULD (unless it supports the
particular version) send a Response message back with version set to
2. Client ID and Sequence Number options SHOULD be echoed if
present. It SHOULD not include any other options. A client receiving
a response with a version other than 2, MUST (unless it supports
the particular version), stop sending requests to the server.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Client ID, type 1
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
Length MUST be non-zero.
A client SHOULD always include this option in all messages
(both Init and Request). The client may use any value it likes to be
able to detect whether a reply is a reply to its Init/Request or not.
A server should treat this as opaque data, and MUST echo this option
back in the reply if present (both Server Response and Reply).
The value might be a
process ID, perhaps process ID combined with an IP address because
it may receive multicast responses to queries from other clients.
It is left to the client implementer how to make use of this option.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sequence Number, type 2
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
Length MUST be 4.
A client MUST always include this in Request messages and MUST NOT
include it in Init messages. A server replying to a Request message
MUST copy it into the Reply (or Server Response message on error).
This contains a 32 bit sequence number. The values would typically
start at 1 and increase by one for each request in a sequence.

This is followed by a prefix length (4-32 for IPv4, 8-128 for IPv6,
or 0 for the special 'wildcard' use discussed below),
and finally a group address. For any family, prefix length 0 means
that any multicast address from that family is acceptable. This is
what we call 'wildcard'.
The group
address need only contain enough octets to cover the prefix length
bits (i.e., the group address would have to be 3 octets long if the
prefix length is 17-24, and there need be no group address for the
wildcard with prefix length 0).  Any bits past the prefix length MUST

a Client ID. It MAY include Option Request and Multicast
Prefix Options. This message is a request for a group address
if and only if it contains Multicast Prefix options. If
multiple Prefix options are included, they should be in prioritised
order. I.e., the server will consider the prefixes in the order
they are specified, and if it finds a group for a prefix,
it will only return that one group, not considering the remaining
prefixes.

message tells the client to stop sending Requests. The Version option
MUST always be included. Client ID and Sequence Number options
are echoed if present in the client message. When providing
a group to the client, it includes a Multicast Group option.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Client Behaviour</h3>

<p>We will consider how a typical interactive client using the
above protocol would behave. A client need only require a user to
specify the unicast address of the server. It can then send an Init
message with a prefix option containing the desired address family
and zero prefix length (wildcard entry). The server is then free to
decide which group, from the specified family, it should return.
A client may also allow a user to specify
group address(es) or prefix(es) (for IPv6, the user may only be
required to specify a scope or an RP address, from which the client
can construct the desired prefix, possibly embedded-RP). From this
the client can specify one or more prefix options in an Init message
to tell the server which address it would prefer. If the user
specifies a group address, that can be encoded as a prefix of
maximal length (e.g., 32 for IPv4). The prefix options are in
prioritised order, i.e., the client should put the most preferred
prefix first.

</p>
<p>
If the client receives a Server Response message containing a
group address it can start sending Request messages, see the next
paragraph. If there is no group address option, it would typically
exit with an error message. The server may have included some
prefix options in the Server Response. The client may use this to
provide the user some feedback on what prefixes or scopes are
available.

</p>
<p>
Assuming the client got a group address in a Server Response, it
can start pinging. Before it does that, it should let the user know
which group is being used. Normally, a client should send at most
one ping request per second. When sending ping Requests, the client
must always include the group option. If the last message from
the server contained a Session ID, then it must also include
that with the same value. Typically it would receive a Session ID
in a Server Response together with the group address, and then
the ID would stay the same during the entire ping sequence.
However, if for instance the server process is restarted, it may
still be possible to continue pinging but the Session ID may be
changed by the server. Hence a client implementation must always
use the last Session ID it received, and not necessarily the one
from the Server Response message. If a client receives a Server
Response message in response to a Request message (that is, a
Server Response message containing a sequence number), this means
there is an error and it should stop sending Requests.
This may for instance happen after server restart.

</p>
<p>
The client may allow the user to request server
information. If the user requests server information, the client
can send an Init message with no prefix options, but with an
Option Request Option, requesting the server to return a Server
Information option. The server will return server information if
supported, and it may also return a list of prefixes it supports.
It will however not return a group address. The client may also
try to obtain only a list of prefixes by sending an Init message
with no prefixes and not requesting any specific options.

</p>
<p>
Note that a client may pick a multicast group and send Request
messages without first going through the Init - Server Response
negotiation. If this is supported by the server and the server
is okay with the group used, the server can then send Reply
messages as usual. If the server is not okay, it will send a
Server Response telling the client to stop.

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;
Server Behaviour</h3>

<p>We will consider how a typical server using the above protocol
would behave. First we consider how to respond to Init messages.
If the Init message contains prefix options, the server should
look at them in order and see if it can assign a multicast
address from the given prefix. The server would be configured,
possibly have a default, specifying which groups it can offer.
It may have a large pool just picking a group at random,
possibly choose a group based on hashing of the client's IP
address or identifier, or just use a fixed group. A server could
possibly decide whether to include site scoped group ranges
based on the client's IP address. It is left to the server to
decide whether it should allow the same address to
be used simultaneously by multiple clients. If the server finds
a suitable group address, it returns this in a group option in a
Server Response message. The server should additionally include a
Session ID. This may help the server if it is to keep some state,
for instance for making sure the client uses the group it got
assigned. A good Session ID would be a pseudo random byte string
that is hard to predict. If the server cannot find a suitable
group address, or if there were no prefixes in the Init message,
it may send a Server Response message containing prefix options
listing what prefixes may be available to the client. Finally,
if the Init message requests the Server Information option, it
should include that.

</p>
<p>
When the server receives a Request message, it may first
check that the group address and Session ID (if provided) are
valid. If the server is satisfied, it will send a unicast Reply
message back to the client, and also a multicast Reply message
to the group address. The Reply messages contain the exact
options and in the same order, as in the Request, and after
that the server adds a TTL option
and additional options if needed. E.g., it may add a timestamp
if requested by the client. If the server is not happy with the
Request (bad group address or Session ID, request is too large
etc), it may send a Server Response
message asking the client to stop. This Server Response must
echo the sequence number from the Request. This Server Response
may contain group prefixes from which a client can
try to request a group address.
The unicast and multicast Reply messages have
identical UDP payload apart from possibly TTL and timestamp
option values.

<p>
</p>
Note that the server may receive Request messages with no
prior Init message. This may happen when the server restarts
or if a client sends a Request with no prior Init message. The
server may go ahead and respond if it is okay with the group
used. In the responses it may add a Session ID which will then
be in later requests from the client. If the group is not okay,
the server sends back a Server Response. The Response is just
as if it got an Init message with no prefixes. If the server
adds or modifies the SessionID in replies, it must use the
exact same SessionID in the unicast and multicast replies.


<p>
By default, a server should perform rate limiting and for a
given client, respond to at most one Request message per
second. A leaky bucket algorithm is suggested, where the rate
can be higher for a few seconds, but the average rate should
by default be limited to a message per client per second.

Recommendations for Implementers</h3>

<p>
The protocol as specified is fairly flexible and leaves a lot of
freedom for implementers. In this section we present some
recommendations.

</p>
<p>Server administrators should be able to configure one or
multiple group prefixes in a server implementation. When
deploying servers on the Internet and in other environments,
the server administrator should be able to restrict the server
to respond to only a few multicast groups which should not be
currently used by multicast applications. A server implementation
should also provide flexibility for an administrator to apply
various policies to provide one or multiple group prefixes to
specific clients, e.g., site scoped addresses for clients that
are inside the site.  Clients could be identified by their IP
address provided that clients are required to send Init messages,
and they receive an unpredictable Session ID.

</p>
<p>
Servers must perform rate limiting, to guard against this protocol
being used for DoS attacks. By default, clients should send at
most one request per second, and servers should perform rate
limiting if a client sends more frequent requests. Server
implementations should provide administrative
control of which client IP addresses to serve, and may also allow
certain clients to perform more rapid requests. Implementers of
applications/tools using this protocol should consider the
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines'>UDP guidelines<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eggert, L. and G. Fairhurst, &ldquo;Unicast UDP Usage Guidelines for Application Designers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [6],
in particular if clients are to send, or servers are to accept,
requests at rates exceeding one per second.

the range 0-255. Message types 0-191 can be assigned referencing
an RFC (it may be Informational), while types 192-255 are freely
available for experimental, private or vendor specifc use.
The registry should include the messages defined in <a class='info' href='#msgs'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Message types and options</span><span>)</span></a>

</p>
<p>
There should also be an option type registry. Option types
0-49151 can be assigned referencing an RFC (it may be Informational),
while types 49152-65535 are freely available for experimental,
private or vendor specifc use.
The registry should include the options defined in <a class='info' href='#opts'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Defined Options</span><span>)</span></a>.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>There are some security issues to consider. One is that a host
may send a request with an IP source address of another host,
and make an arbitrary multicast ping server on the Internet send
packets to this other host. This behaviour is fairly harmless.
The worst case is if the host receiving the unicast
replies also happen to be joined to the multicast group used. In
this case, there would be an amplification effect where the host
receives twice as many replies as there are
requests sent.

</p>
<p>
In order to help prevent spoofing, a server SHOULD require the
client to send an Init message, and return an unpredictable
Session ID in the response. The ID should be associated with the
IP address and have a limited lifetime. The server SHOULD then
only respond to Request messages that have a valid Session ID
associated with the source IP address of the Request.

</p>
<p>
Server implementations should allow administrators to restrict
which groups a server responds to, and also perform rate
limiting. This is discussed in <a class='info' href='#imprec'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Recommendations for Implementers</span><span>)</span></a>).
