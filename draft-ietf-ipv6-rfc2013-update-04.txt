1.  Revision History

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please remove prior to publication]

   Changes from draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2013-update-02.txt

   18 October 2004 - IETF Last Call comments

      Updated reference to RFC3291 to refer to 3291bis internet-draft.

      Updated DESCRIPTION clause of the most recent REVISION clause to
      reflect the changes that have been made since RFC 2013.

      Updated DESCRIPTION clause of least recent REVISION clause to
      reflect that MIB-II was published as RFC 1213.

      Added pseudo OBJECT clauses to the description of
      udpMIBCompliance2 for udpEndpointLocalAddress and
      udpEndpointRemoteAddress.

      Updated Overview section so that all references are cited.

      Moved references to RFC 2287 and RFC 2790 from Normative
      References to Informative References, since they are not actually
      required for implementation, and we don't want advancement of this
      document to be blocked.

      Removed use of zero-length addresses to represent wildcard
      listeners when the version is specified.  Instead, use zero valued
      addresses of the appropriate length.  Updated udpEndpointTable and
      udpEndpointLocalAddress DESCRIPTION clauses to reflect this.

      Added IANA Considerations section.

      Updated IPR boilerplate.

   Changes from draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2013-update-02.txt

   27 April 2004

      Added text to section 2.1.2 to clarify why an equivalent to RFC
      2454's ipv6UdpIfIndex is not required.

      Changed the text of the Security Considerations so that it no
      longer implies that udpEndpointLocalPort is readable, but is
      instead only returned as part of an index.

      Added an explicit reference to sysUpTime as a discontinuity

      indicator to the counter objects in the mib.

      Reworded the description of udpEndpointLocalAddress to indicate
      that it can be used to represent any address that the local system
      is listening to, not just addresses assigned to the system.

      Updated the description of InetAddress objects used as index
      elements to indicate the 128 octet limit.

      Added a note to the description of udpEndpointRemoteAddressType to
      indicate that some combinations of udpEndpointLocalAddressType and
      udpEndpointRemoteAddressType are not legal.

      Reverted udpEndpointInstance to not-accessible, since
      udpEndpointProcess is now a mandatory to implement object (to
      align with the TCP-MIB).

      Added text to the udpEndpointInstance description to describe why
      it is needed.

      Added pseudo OBJECT clauses to the description of
      udpMIBCompliance2 for udpEndpointLocalAddressType and
      udpEndpointRemoteAddressType.

      Removed udpEndpointInstance from the udpEndpointGroup, since it is
      now not-accessible, and added udpEndpointProcess to the
      udpEndpointGroup, since it is now mandatory.  Removed the
      udpEndpointProcessGroup.

   Changes from draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2013-update-00.txt

   24 October 2003

      Dropped udpEndpointInDatagrams, udpEndpointHCInDatagrams,
      udpEndpointOutDatagrams, udpEndpointHCOutDatagrams,
      udpEndpointInOctets, udpEndpointHCInOctets, udpEndpointOutOctets,
      udpEndpointHCOutOctets, and udpEndpointStartTime.

      Removed udpEndpointStatsGroup, udpEndpointHCDatagramStatsGroup and
      udpEndpointHCOctetStatsGroup.

      Changed udpEndpointInstance back to read-only, since there is no
      longer a mandatory non-auxiliary column in the udpEndpointTable.

      Removed Open Issues section.

      Moved Revision History section to beginning of document and
      removed its section number, to allow for easier removal at RFC

      publication.

      Updated to latest MIB boilerplate.

      Updated working group mailing list address.

      Removed SIZE constraints from udpEndpointLocalAddress and
      udpEndpointRemoteAddress, and updated the DESCRIPTION clause of
      udpEndpointEntry.

      Removed "Use of IP Addresses" section, since this information is
      already documented in the relevant MIB DESCRIPTIONs.

   Changes from draft-ietf-ipngwg-rfc2013-update-01.txt

   28 May 2002

      Removed udpConnectionTable.

      Renamed ListenerTable to EndpointTable, since with a remote
      address Listener is not quite correct.

      Use ''h consistently for 'any IP address', instead of sometimes
      ''h and sometimes all-zeroes of the right address family.

      Use "Datagram" instead of "Packet" to talk about UDP datagrams.

      Added mandatory udpEndpointStartTime, this also fixes the
      udpEndpointInstance needing to be read-only and mandatory.

      Make udpEndpointProcess mandatory on systems that have process
      IDs.

      Make a note of { udp 6 } in a comment for clarity on why it's
      skipped.

      Fleshed out section 3.

      Changed the deprecated udpLocalPort SYNTAX to Integer32.  Since it
      was already restricted to (0..65536) this is not a semantic
      change.

   Changes from draft-ietf-ipngwg-rfc2013-update-00.txt

   14 November 2001

      Added udpConnectionTable.

      Added HC in and out datagram counters

      Added SIZE restriction to udpListenerLocalAddress.  (36 = 32-byte

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for implementations
   of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), as defined in RFC 768 [RFC0768],
   in an IP version independent manner.

   The current UDP-MIB defined in this memo consists of one table and a
   group of scalars:

   o  The udp group of scalars reports parameters and statistics of a
      UDP protocol engine.  Two scalars udpHCInDatagrams and
      udpHCOutDatagrams have been added to this group since the
      publication of RFC 2013 [RFC2013] in order to provide
      high-capacity counters for fast networks.  Discontinuities in the
      values of the counters in this group are indicated by
      discontinuities in the value of the sysUpTime object, which is
      defined in RFC 3418 [RFC3418].

   o  The udpEndpointTable provides access to status information for all
      UDP endpoints handled by a UDP protocol engine.  The table
      provides for strictly listening endpoints, as with the historical
      udpTable, and also for "connected" UDP endpoints, which only
      accept packets from a given remote system.  It also reports
      identification of the operating system level processes which
      handle UDP connections.  Addresses and ports of UDP endpoints in
      this table are represented using the InetAddressType, InetAddress,
      and InetPortNumber textual conventions defined in RFC 3291bis
      [I-D.ietf-ops-rfc3291bis].

Internet-Draft                  UDP MIB                     October 2004


3.1  Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section discusses the relationship of this UDP-MIB module to
   other MIB modules.

3.1.1  Relationship to RFC1213-MIB

   UDP related MIB objects were originally defined as part of the
   RFC1213-MIB defined in RFC 1213 [RFC1213].  The UDP related objects
   of the RFC1213-MIB were later copied into a separate MIB module and
   published in RFC 2013 [RFC2013] in SMIv2 format.

   The previous versions of the UDP-MIB both defined the udpTable, which
   has been deprecated for basically two reasons:

   (1) The udpTable only supports IPv4.

       The current approach in the IETF is to write IP version neutral
       MIBs rather than having different definitions for various version
       of IP.  This reduces the amount of overhead when new objects are
       introduced since there is only one place to add them.  Hence, the
       approach taken in RFC 2454 [RFC2454] of having separate tables is
       not continued.

   (2) The udpTable does not permit describing "connected" UDP
       endpoints.

       It turns out that "connected" endpoints tend to have a different
       behaviour and management access pattern compared to listening
       endpoints.  Adding remote endpoint information to the
       udpEndpointTable thus allows for the addition of specific status
       and statistic objects for "connected" endpoints and connections.

3.1.2  Relationship to the IPV6-UDP-MIB

   The IPV6-UDP-MIB defined in RFC 2454 [RFC2454] has been moved to
   Historic since the approach of having separate IP version specific
   tables is not followed anymore.  Implementation of RFC 2454 is thus
   not suggested anymore.

   Note that since scoped addresses are now represented using the ipv4z
   and ipv6z address types, there is no longer a need to explicitly
   include the ifIndex in the index clause of the udpEndpointTable.
   This is a change from the use of ipv6UdpIfIndex in RFC 2454.

3.1.3  Relationship to HOST-RESOURCES-MIB and SYSAPPL-MIB

   The udpEndpointTable reports the identification of the operating

   system level process which handles a connection or a listening
   endpoint.  The value is reported as an Unsigned32 which is expected
   to be the same as the hrSWRunIndex of the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
   [RFC2790] (if the value is smaller than 2147483647) or the
   sysApplElmtRunIndex of the SYSAPPL-MIB [RFC2287].  This allows
   managment applications to identify the UDP connections that belong to
   an operating system level process, which has proven to be valuable in
   operational environments.

               type used for the communication, irrespective of the
               higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an application
               using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between
               ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use
               InetAddressType ipv4(1).

               Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows
               the representation of an application which completely
               specifies both local and remote addresses and ports.  A
               listening application is represented in three possible
               ways:

               1) an application which is willing to accept both IPv4
                  and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
                  udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and
                  udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length
                  octet-string).

               2) an application which is willing to accept only IPv4
                  or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
                  udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
                  address type, and udpEndpointLocalAddress of
                  '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively.

               3) an application which is listening for datagrams only
                  for a specific IP address, but from any remote
                  system, is repesented by a
                  udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
                  address type, udpEndpointLocalAddress specifying the
                  local address.

               In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the
               udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the
               udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length
               octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0.

               If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets
               by remote address and port, or if the application has
               'connected' the socket specifying a default remote
               address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should
               be used to reflect this."

   Much of Keith McCloghrie's text from RFC1213/RFC2013 remains in this
   document, and the structure of the MIB is due to him.

   Mike Daniele wrote the original IPv6 UDP MIB in RFC2454.

   Juergen Schoenwalder provided much of the text for section 2.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB
   is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
   SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The indices of the udpEndpointTable and udpTable contain information
   on the listeners on an entity.  In particular, the
   udpEndpointLocalPort and udpLocalPort objects in the indices can be
   used to identify what ports are open on the machine and can thus what
   attacks are likely to succeed, without the attacker having to run a
   port scanner.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Furthermore, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

                +------------+-------------------------+
                | Descriptor | OBJECT IDENTIFIER value |
                +------------+-------------------------+
                | udp        | { mib-2 7}              |
                | udpMIB     | { mib-2 50 }            |
                +------------+-------------------------+

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): this draft makes
   no additional requests of the IANA.
