1.  Introduction

   The Mobile Node Identifier Option for MIPv6 [RFC4283] has proved to
   be a popular design tool for providing identifiers for mobile nodes
   during authentication procedures with AAA protocols such as Diameter
   [RFC3588].  To date, only a single type of identifier has been
   specified, namely the MN NAI.  Other types of identifiers are in
   common use, and even referenced in RFC 4283.  In this document, we
   propose adding some basic types that are defined in various
   telecommunications standards, including types for IMSI
   [ThreeGPP-IDS], P-TMSI [ThreeGPP-IDS], IMEI [ThreeGPP-IDS], and GUTI
   [ThreeGPP-IDS].  In addition, we include IEEE MAC-layer addresses the
   IPv6 address itself as a legitimate mobile node identifier.  Defining
   identifiers that are tied to the physical elements of the device
   (RFID, MAC address etc.) help in deployment of Mobile IP because in
   many cases such identifiers are the most natural means for uniquely
   identifying the device, and will avoid additional look-up steps that
   might be needed if other identifiers were used.

2.  New Mobile Node Identifier Types

   The following types of identifiers are commonly used to identify
   mobile nodes.  For each type, references are provided with full
   details on the format of the type of identifer.

   The Tag Data standard promoted by Electronic Product Code(TM)
   (abbreviated EPC) supports several encoding systems or schemes
   including

   o  RFID-GID (Global Identifier),
   o  RFID-SGTIN (Serialized Global Trade Item Number),
   o  RFID-SSCC (Serial Shipping Container),
   o  RFID-GLN (Global Location Number),
   o  RFID-GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier),
   o  RFID-DOD (Department of Defense ID), and
   o  RFID-GIAI (Global Individual Asset Identifier).

Internet-Draft      MN Identifier Types for RFC 4283        October 2015


   For each RFID scheme except GID, there are two variations: a 64-bit
   scheme (for example, GLN-64) and a 96-bit scheme (GLN-96).  GID has
   only a 96-bit scheme.  Within each scheme, an EPC identifier can be
   represented in a binary form or other forms such as URI.

   The following list includes the above RFID types as well as various
   other common identifiers and several different types of DUIDs.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.  Insofar as the
   selection of a security association may be dependent on the exact
   form of a mobile node identifier, additional specification may be
   necessary when the new identifier types are employed with the general
   AAA mechanisms for mobile node authorizations.

   Some identifiers (e.g., IMSI) are considered to be private
   information.  If used in the MNID extension as defined in this
   document, the packet including the MNID extension should be encrypted
   so that personal information or trackable identifiers would not be
   inadvertently disclosed to passive observers.  Operators can
   potentially apply IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) with
   confidentiality and integrity protection for protecting the location
   information.

   Moreover, MNIDs containing sensitive identifiers might only be used
   for signaling during initial network entry.  Subsequent binding
   update exchanges might then rely on a temporary identifier allocated
   during the initial network entry, perhaps using mechanisms not
   standardized within the IETF.  Managing the association between long-

   document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The new mobile node identifier types defined in the document should
   be assigned values from the "Mobile Node Identifier Option Subtypes"
   registry.  The following values should be assigned.
