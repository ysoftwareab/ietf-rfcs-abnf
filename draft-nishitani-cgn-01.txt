Internet-Draft               Large Scale NAT               November 2008


1.  Introduction

   Global IPv4 address from the IANA pool will run out in a few years,
   thus network operators such as ISPs, carriers, large enterprises,
   universities need to shift from IPv4 services to IPv6 ones.  However,
   IPv6 deployment seems to take a long time.

   NAT [RFC3022] is a key technology to utilize IPv4 global address
   effectively in current practice.  Operators may have to place NAT
   devices between end-users and the public Internet to suppress global
   IPv4 address consumption.

   In this document, we call big NAT device Large Scale NAT (LSN).

   Variety of LSN (Large Scale NAT) have been proposed.  Some of them
   are proposed for business continuity after the exhaustion, and some
   of them are proposed to access from IPv6 network to IPv4 Internet.

      - NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr]

      - DS-Lite (NAT464) [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4]

      - NAT-64 [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64]

   Each types of Large Scale NAT are shared by plural users and forward
   huge traffic.  Because a demand is common, many of necessary
   functions are common.

   By defining the common function in this document, developers of Large
   Scale NAT can put their development resource into their maker
   specific function.  On the other hand, operator can introduce the
   Large Scale NAT that meets their requirement.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with [RFC4787] and the terms
   defined there.  The following term are used in this document:

      Large-Scale NAT(LSN): NAT devices placed between CPE and public
      Internet by a operator.  LSN converts CPE IP Address, CPE Port,
      and CPE Identifier into LSN external IP Address, LSN external Port
      and LSN external Identifier in communication between CPE and GGN
      external.

                                LSN network


3.  The policy of assignment of LSN external IP address, port and
    identifier

   A LSN has a pool of LSN external IP addresses, ports and identifiers.
   CPEs share LSN external IP addresses.  Each LSN occupies combination
   of LSN external IP address and LSN external port exclusively.  For a
   fair use of limited resources, LSN has a limitation for the number of
   the LSN external ports per CPE.  LSNs need to keep high transparency
   to continue existing services after LSN is introduced.  Requirement
   of high transparency for LSN leads to high scalability of LSN.  High
   transparency means LSN basically keeps communications among CPEs
   except effect of limitations of the number of LSN external ports and
   TCP sessions.

   A CPE MAY apply UDP hole punching or TCP hole punching for
   interactive services among CPEs like Voice over IP and P2P. LSN
   SHOLUD NOT interfere in services using UDP hole punching or TCP hole
   punching.

   REQ-1: A LSN MUST allocate one external IP address to each CPE.

      a) LSN external IP address of the UDP, TCP and ICMP MUST be same.

   Justification: If a LSN allocates multiple LSN external IP addresses
   to each CPE, some applications might not work.

   REQ-2: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external ports corresponding to CPE

   ports of UDP.

      a) A LSN MUST NOT overload LSN external port while a NAT UDP
      mapping timer does not expire.

      b) A LSN MAY overload LSN external port after a NAT UDP mapping
      timer expires.

      c) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the LSN external ports of UDP
      per CPE.

      d) The number of the LSN external ports of UDP per CPE which LSN
      can allocate SHOULD be configurable for the administrator of LSN.

      e) A LSN SHOULD NOT allocate well-known ports as LSN external
      ports.

   Justification: CPEs can communicate to CPE external realm fairly by
   limiting the number of LSN external ports per CPE.

   REQ-3: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external ports corresponding to CPE
   ports of TCP.

      a) A LSN MUST NOT overload LSN external port while the port is
      allocated for one or more TCP sessions originated by another CPE.

      b) A LSN MAY reuse LSN external port while the port is allocated
      for no session originated by any CPE.

      c) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the LSN external ports of TCP
      per CPE.

      d) The number of the LSN external ports of TCP per CPE SHOULD be
      an administratively configurable option.

      e) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the new sessions of TCP per
      time unit and per CPE.

      f) A LSN SHOULD NOT allocate well-known ports as LSN external
      ports.

   Justification: CPEs can communicate to CPE external realm fairly by
   limiting the number of LSN external ports per CPE.  In addition, TCP
   LSN external port MAY have TCP sessions, and therefore the TCP
   session timer is necessary for every 5-Tuple.  LSN can have not only
   the limitations of the number of LSN external ports but also TCP
   sessions per CPE.  Thus a LSN can prevent denial of service attacks
   with the tons of TCP open and close by malicious CPEs.

   REQ-4: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external identifiers corresponding to
   CPE identifiers.

      a) A LSN MUST NOT overload LSN external identifier before an ICMP
      Query session timer expires.

      b) A LSN MAY overload LSN external identifier after an ICMP Query
      session timer expires.

      c) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the LSN external identifier
      allocated per CPE.

      d) The number of the LSN external identifiers per CPE which LSN
      can allocate SHOULD be an administratively configurable option.

   Justification: CPEs can communicate to CPE external realm fairly by
   limiting the number of LSN external identifiers every CPE.

   When a LSN limits the number of LSN external ports and TCP sessions,
   CPE may not use TCP services during using web and P2P services.  For
   example, some services using Ajax demand few dozens of TCP sessions.
   P2P software like BitTorrent demands also TCP sessions more than few
   dozens.  Some CPEs MAY use E-mail services like POP3 and SMTP even
   though CPE uses the services which demand many TCP sessions at the
   same time.  Therefore it is important to reserve LSN external ports
   for such administratively configured services.

   REQ-5: Reserving LSN external ports per CPE for the always-available
   services are RECOMENDED.

      a) The destination port which is used for reservation of LSN
      external ports SHOULD be administratively configurable.

   Justification: To reserve the LSN external ports for specific
   services, CPE can avoid the effect of the limitation of LSN external
   ports by LSN.

   In addition, it MAY not be necessary to set a limit to the number of
   LSN external ports for the communications between CPEs and SS.  The
   reason is because LSN should pass-through the communications between
   CPEs and SS.

                               pass-through

   REQ-6: A LSN SHOULD pass-through the communication between CPEs and
   SS.

   Justification: Using pass-through, LSN does not have to assign LSN
   external IP address, ports, and identifiers and limit to the number
   of ports and TCP sessions for the services that an operator manages.


4.  Requirements for protocol handling

4.1.  Unicast UDP Requirements

   [RFC4787] describes requirements of the Unicast UDP of a NAT, and the
   behavior of "Endpoint-Independent Filtering "is RECOMMNEDED, and a
   NAT MUST have an "Endpoint-Independent Mapping" behavior to ensure
   transparency of LSN.

   To have "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" and "Endpoint-Independent
   Mapping" behaviors for LSNs, LSNs help to establish UDP Hole Punching
   among CPEs.  In other words, the possibility of the establishment of
   UDP Hole Punching among CPEs which have LSN is equal to the
   possibility among CPEs which don's t have LSN.  If LSNs have an
   "Address-Dependent Mapping" or "Address and Port-Dependent Mapping"
   behavior, the possibility that establishment of UDP Hole Punching is
   less than when LSNs have an "Endpoint-Independent Mapping" behavior.
   And if LSNs have an "Address and Port-Dependent Filtering" behavior,
   the possibility that establishment of UDP Hole Punching is less than
   when LSNs have an "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" or "Address
   Dependent Filtering" behavior.  Because a SS is placed external LSN
   realm, the source IP address and port of the communication from CPE
   to SS is LSN external IP address and port.  It is RECOMMENDED to use
   STUN[I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] if CPEs check the LSN external IP
   address and port for CPE.

   An operator MAY introduce TURN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] to support

   communications among CPEs.  If LSN supports "Hairpinning", LSN can
   hairpin the communications between CPEs in the same LSN.  Therefore
   the requirements of Hairpinning for LSN MAY reduce requirements for
   the performance of TURN servers.  When CPEs decide the course of UDP
   between CPEs, CPE MAY use [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] .

                                Hairpinning

   REQ-7: A LSN SHOULD comply with [RFC4787] for unicast UDP.

   Justification: LSN SHOULD have to keep high transparency for unicast
   UDP communications.  And CPE MAY use P2P and interactive services
   between CPEs after a LSN is introduced.

4.2.  TCP Requirements

   [I-D.ietf-behave-tcp] describes requirements of TCP of a NAT, and the
   behavior of "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" is RECOMMNEDED, and a
   NAT MUST have an "Endpoint-Independent Mapping" behavior to ensure
   transparency of LSN

   To have "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" and "Endpoint-Independent
   Mapping" behaviors for LSNs, LSNs help to establish TCP Hole Punching
   among CPEs.  In other words, the possibility of the establishment of
   TCP Hole Punching among CPEs which have LSN is equal to the
   possibility among CPEs which don's t have LSN.  If LSNs have an
   "Address-Dependent Mapping" or "Address and Port-Dependent Mapping"
   behavior, the possibility that establishment of TCP Hole Punching is
   less than when LSNs have an "Endpoint-Independent Mapping" behavior.
   And if LSNs have an "Address and Port-Dependent Filtering" behavior,
   the possibility that establishment of TCP Hole Punching is less than
   when LSNs have an "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" or "Address
   Dependent Filtering" behavior.  Because a SS is placed external LSN
   realm, the source of IP address and port of the communication from

Internet-Draft               Large Scale NAT               November 2008


   CPE to SS is LSN external IP address and port.  It is RECOMMENDED to
   use STUN[I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] if CPEs want to check the LSN
   external IP address and port for CPE.

   An operator MAY introduce TURN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] to support
   communications among CPEs.  If LSN supports "Hairpinning", LSN can
   hairpin the communications between CPEs in the same LSN.  Therefore
   the requirements of Hairpinning for LSN MAY reduce requirements for
   the performance of TURN servers.  When CPEs decide the course of TCP
   between CPEs, CPE MAY use [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] .

   REQ-8: A LSN SHOULD comply with [I-D.ietf-behave-tcp] for TCP.

   Justification: LSN SHOULD have to keep high transparency for TCP
   communications.  And CPE MAY use P2P and interactive services between
   CPEs after a LSN is introduced.

4.3.  ICMP Requirements

   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-icmp] describes requirements of ICMP of a NAT.
   And there MAY be a case that CPE cannot establish communication from
   CPEs to LSN external realm because LSN limits the number of LSN
   external ports, identifiers and TCP sessions per CPE.  It is useful
   if CPE can distinguish an error to occur by the limitation of the LSN
   external ports, identifiers and TCP sessions from other errors.

   REQ-9: A LSN SHOULD comply with [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-icmp] for ICMP.

      a) When a LSN can't establish new session of TCP/UDP by limiting
      of TCP/UDP ports per user, the LSN sends an ICMP destination
      unreachable message, with code of 13 (Communication
      administratively prohibited) to the sender.

   Justification: LSN SHOULD have to keep high transparency for ICMP.
   And CPE MAY use P2P and interactive services between CPEs after a LSN
   is introduced.  And it is necessary to be able to distinguish an
   error to occur by the limitation of the LSN external ports and TCP
   sessions from a network error.

4.4.  Summary of Requirements

   REQ-1: A LSN MUST allocate one external IP address to each CPE.

      a) LSN external IP address of the UDP, TCP and ICMP MUST be same.

   REQ-2: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external ports corresponding to CPE
   ports of UDP.

      f) A LSN SHOULD NOT allocate well-known ports as LSN external
      ports.

   REQ-4: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external identifiers corresponding to
   CPE identifiers.

      a) A LSN MUST NOT overload LSN external identifier before an ICMP
      Query session timer expires.

      b) A LSN MAY overload LSN external identifier after an ICMP Query
      session timer expires.

      c) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the LSN external identifier
      allocated per CPE.

      d) The number of the LSN external identifiers per CPE which LSN
      can allocate SHOULD be an administratively configurable option.

   REQ-5: Reserving LSN external ports per CPE for the always-available
   services are RECOMENDED.

      a) The destination port which is used for reservation of LSN
      external ports SHOULD be administratively configurable.

   REQ-6: A LSN SHOULD pass-through the communication between CPEs and
   SS.

   REQ-7: A LSN SHOULD comply with [RFC4787] for unicast UDP.

   REQ-8: A LSN SHOULD comply with [I-D.ietf-behave-tcp] for TCP.

   REQ-9: A LSN SHOULD comply with [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-icmp] for ICMP.

      a) When a LSN can't establish new session of TCP/UDP by limiting
      of TCP/UDP ports per user, the LSN sends an ICMP destination
      unreachable message, with code of 13 (Communication
      administratively prohibited) to the sender.


5.   Identifying particular users (BOTs, spammers, etc)

   It is necessary for network administrators to identify a user from an
   IP address and a timestamp in order to deal with abuse and lawful
   intercept.  When multiple users share one external address at LSN,
   the source address and the source port that are visible at the
   destination host are translated ones.  The following mechanisms can
   be used to identify the user that transmitted a certain packet.

5.1.  Store Translation Log

   One mechanism stores the following information at LSN.

      - destination address

      - destination port

      - translated source address

      - translated source port

      - untranslated source address

Internet-Draft               Large Scale NAT               November 2008


      - untranslated source port

      - timestamp

   In such environment that one LSN accommodates a lot of users or
   processes large amount of traffic, the amount of log will be so large
   and the operator has to prepare large volume of storage.

5.2.  Fixed port assignment

   To save costs for storage, one can adopt this port assignment
   mechanism at LSN.  By fixing the range of external port per user/CPE,
   and having the mapping of internal IP address to external IP address
   and port, there will be no need to store per session log.  Note that
   this mechanism is possible only if the source port is known as well
   as the source address, the destination address and the destination
   port.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.


7.  Security Considerations

   If malicious CPE can camouflage CPE 3-Tuple, the malicious CPE MAY
   prevent a normal CPE from sending data to external realm.  Therefore,
   an operator SHOULD make policies to prevent a spoofing of CPE
   3-tuple.
