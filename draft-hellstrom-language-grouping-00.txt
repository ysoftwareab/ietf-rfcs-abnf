   Human Language Modality Grouping Semantics in Session Description
                                Protocol
                  draft-hellstrom-language-grouping-00

Abstract

   In a real-time communication session, there may be a need or
   preference for receiving the same content in two or more simultaneous
   modalities.  There may also be a need to prioritize which media to
   use for language communications.  This document defines the semantics
   for grouping media in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   containing human languages in order to assign their relative priority
   and also grouping media that are desired to be received together.
   The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP
   Grouping Framework.  Applications are for example a possibility to
   indicate when a sign language is most desired, but written language
   an acceptable lower rated alternative, offered for the other party to
   select between.  Applications are also for indication of need for
   both spoken and written content in a real-time call (captioning)
   together, or provision of both spoken language original and sign
   language interpretation of the original language together in a real-
   time session.  These indications are specified for the sending and
   receiving direction separately.

1.  Introduction

   In certain applications it is of interest to indicate a need for, or
   the availability of, transformed version of the contents of a media
   stream in another media, while still also providing the original.

   The application of this indication may for example be for rapid
   subtitling of speech either manually or automatically.  It may also
   be sign language interpretation of speech, or spoken interpretation

Internet-Draft              Modality Grouping                  June 2017


   of sign language when both the original and the interpretation is
   delivered to the user.

   This specification defines an indication that language contents in
   one modality is desired simultaneously with a different modality.
   The mechaism used is based on the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Grouping Framework [RFC5888] and used with SDP [RFC4566].  The same
   indication is used for indication of preparedness to send language
   contents in one modality simultaneously with same content in a
   different modality.

   When starting a conversation in a media-rich environment, the users
   may have very specific preferences for using one modality (spoken,
   written or signed) over other possible but less preferred modalities.
   In traditional call establishment, it is the answering part who is
   expected to start the conversation by a greeting.  In the media-rich
   environment, the modality and language of this greeting sets the
   expectations for what modality and language to mainly use in the
   session.  Deviation from this initial expectation is usually possible
   during the session by mutual agreement between the participants, but
   may be time consuming and cause uncertainty.

   A way for the parties to not only indicate alternative languages and
   modalities for the communication directions in the session, but also
   indicate preference for specific modalities per direction provides
   the opportunity to more exactly describe the desired language
   communication for a session, while still providing information about
   less preferred alternatives.  This specification defines a mechanism
   for indicating modality preference based on the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework [RFC5888].

   The expected application area is wide.  By old tradition, the most
   common modality for real-time interaction is spoken communication.
   In some settings, e.g. where silence is required, it may be desirable
   to express a preference for using written communication, while still
   leaving a possibility open for traditional spoken communication by an
   indication on lower preference level.  For persons having full
   ability to both use sign language and spoken language, but not
   wanting to force the other party to bring in a sign language
   interpreter in the call, it may be of importance to be able to
   indicate the sign language capability on a lower preference level and
   the spoken laanguage capability on a higher level.  Some persons with
   disabilities may strongly prefer to conduct a written conversation,
   while still wanting to express that a spoken conversation is possible
   as a last resort.  Many other situations exist in the media-rich
   communication environment when the media preference indication is of
   value for a smooth initiation of a real-time session.

Internet-Draft              Modality Grouping                  June 2017


   The mechanisms for specifying simultaneous use of language in
   different modalities and preferece between modalities may be combined
   with a mechanism for specifying language use in media.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements for Modality Grouping

3.1.  Simultaneous Use of Different Modalities

   The grouping semantics for indication of simultaneous use of
   different media for different transforms of the same language shall
   have the ability to indicate:

   o  That the language contents of one media is desired or offered also
      simultaneously in a transformed form in other media grouped with
      the first.

   o  The direction of language communication that the indication is
      valid for; sending or receiving as seen from the party providing
      the SDP.

3.2.  Preference for Language in Different Modality

   The grouping semantics for indication of relative preference between
   use for language communication in different media and modalities
   shall have the ability to indicate:

   o  The order of preference for receiving or providing language
      contents in the media included in a grouping.

   o  The direction of language communication that the indication is
      valid for; sending or receiving as seen from the party providing
      the SDP.

4.  Modality Grouping

4.1.  Simultaneous Use of Different Modalities

   The "Human Language Simultaneous Send" (HLSS) and "Human Language
   Simultaneous Receive" (HLSR) grouping semantics and the SDP "group"
   attribute defined in [RFC5888] are used to associate media in which
   it is indicated that different transforms of the same content is

Internet-Draft              Modality Grouping                  June 2017


   either desired to be received by a party or offered for sending by a
   party.

   The "a=group:HLSS" semantics SHOULD be used to indicate media
   grouping for preparedness for sending of same language contents in
   different transforms in all media included in the group.

   The "a=group:HLSR" semantics SHOULD be used to indicate media
   grouping for preference for reception of language contents in
   different transforms in all media in the group.

   The HLSS and HLSR semantics MAY be used together with mechanisms for
   detailing language use in media.  One such mechanism is
   [I-D.ietf-slim-negotiating-human-language].

4.2.  Preference for Language in Different Modality

   The "Human Language Preferred Send" (HLPS) and "Human Language
   Preferred Receive" (HLSR) grouping semantics and the SDP "group"
   attribute defined in [RFC5888] are used to associate media among
   which it is indicated an order of preference for using the media for
   language contents.  The order of preference is that the media
   identity first in the group has highest preference and the following
   have lower preference in the same order as they appear in the group
   definition.

   The "a=group:HLPS" semantics SHOULD be used to indicate media
   grouping for preparedness for sending of language contents with
   preference in the same order as the media identities appear in the
   group with the first having highest preference.  .

   The "a=group:HLSR" semantics SHOULD be used to indicate media
   grouping for preference for reception of language contents with
   preference in the same order as the media identities appear in the
   group with the first having highest preference.

   The HLSS and HLSR semantics MAY be used together with mechanisms for
   detailing language use in media.  One such mechanism is
   [I-D.ietf-slim-negotiating-human-language].

5.  SDP Offer/Answer Considerations

   The following SDP offer/answer considerations according to [RFC3264]
   apply.

   An application that understands the received HLSR, HLSS, HLPR or HLPS
   grouping semantics SHOULD make efforts to satisfy the preferences
   expressed by the grouping semantic.

Internet-Draft              Modality Grouping                  June 2017


   HLSR, HLSS, HLPR or HLPS grouping semantics corresponding to what the
   application prefers to receive and what the application is prepared
   to send, best matching the received preference indications and its
   own capabilities SHOULD be included in the answer.

   The offering party SHOULD analyze the answer and make best effort to
   transmit language contents in media according to the answer.

   The grouping semantics defined in this document are only informing
   about language contents disposition in media and SHOULD not be taken
   as reasons to enable or reject media streams.

   Media not included in any HLPR or HLPS grouping are assumed to be
   assigned lower preference for being used for language communication
   than the ones included in HLPR or HLPS grouping.

   If the HLSR, HLSS, HLPR or HLPS grouping semantics are used without
   any further language specifications, video media SHOULD be assumed to
   be used for sign language.

   Note that grouping of "m" lines MUST always be requested by the
   offerer, but never by the answerer.  Since SIP provides a two-way SDP
   exchange, an answerer that requested grouping would not know whether
   the "group" attribute was accepted by the offerer or not.  An
   answerer that wants to group media lines issues another offer after
   having responded to the first one (in a re-INVITE, for instance).

9.  Security Considerations

   Modality preference information may belong to the kind of sensitive
   user information that some users do not want to be presented to
   anyone.  Measures for protection against unauthorized access to the
   modality preference information should therefore be prepared and
   activated when so required.  Intended callees should be regarded to
   be authorized to access the callers modality preference information.
   The modality preference information should be treated with similar
   security and privacy measures as other user information such as
   addresses and language preferences.
