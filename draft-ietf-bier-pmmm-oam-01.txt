1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] introduces and explains Bit Index
   Explicit Replication (BIER) architecture and how it supports
   forwarding of multicast data packets.
   [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] specified that in case of BIER
   encapsulation in MPLS network a BIER-MPLS label, label that is at the
   bottom of the label stack, uniquely identifies the multicast flow.
   [I-D.tempia-ippm-p3m] describes passive performance measurement
   method , Packet Network Performance Monitoring (PNPM), which can be
   used to measure packet loss, latency and jitter on live traffic.
   Because this method is based on marking consecutive batches of
   packets the method often referred as Marking Method (MM).

   This document defines how marking method can be used on BIER layer to
   measure packet loss and delay metrics of a multicast flow in MPLS
   network.

3.  OAM Field in BIER Header

   [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] defined two bit long field,
   referred as OAM, designated for the marking performance measurement
   method.  The OAM field MUST NOT be used in defining forwarding and/or
   quality of service treatment of a BIER packet.  The OAM field MUST be
   used only for the performance measurement of data traffic in BIER
   layer.  Because setting of the field to any value does not affect
   forwarding and/or quality of service treatment of a packet, the
   marking method in BIER layer can be viewed as true example of passive
   performance measurement method.

4.  Theory of Operation

   The marking method can be successfully used in the multicast
   environment supported by BIER layer.  Without limiting any generality
   consider multicast network presented in Figure 2.  Any combination of
   markings, Loss and/or Delay, can be applied to a multicast flow by
   any Bit Forwarding Router (BFR) at either ingress or egress point to

   perform node, link, segment or end-to-end measurement to detect
   performance degradation defect and localize it efficiently.

   Using the marking method a BFR creates distinct sub-flows in the
   particular multicast traffic over BIER layer.  Each sub-flow consists
   of consecutive blocks that are unambiguously recognizable by a
   monitoring point at any BFR and can be measured to calculate packet
   loss and/or packet delay metrics.

4.1.  Single Mark Enabled Measurement

   As explained in the [I-D.tempia-ippm-p3m], marking can be applied to
   delineate blocks of packets based either on equal number of packets
   in a block or based on equal time interval.  The latter method offers
   better control as it allows better account for capabilities of
   downstream nodes to report statistics related to batches of packets
   and, at the same time, time resolution that affects defect detection
   interval.

   If the Single Mark measurement used, then the D flag MUST be set to
   zero on transmit and ignored by monitoring point.

   The S flag is used to create alternate flows to measure the packet
   loss by switching value of the S flag every N-th packet or at certain
   time intervals.  Delay metrics MAY be calculated with the alternate
   flow using any of the following methods:

   o  First/Last Packet Delay calculation: whenever the marking, i.e.
      value of S flag, changes a BFR can store the timestamp of the



Mirsky, et al.            Expires July 27, 2017                 [Page 4]

      first/last packet of the block.  The timestamp can be compared
      with the timestamp of the packet that arrived in the same order
      through a monitoring point at downstream BFR to compute packet
      delay.  Because timestamps collected based on order of arrival
      this method is sensitive to packet loss and re-ordering of packets

   o  Average Packet Delay calculation: an average delay is calculated
      by considering the average arrival time of the packets within a
      single block.  A BFR may collect timestamps for each packet
      received within a single block.  Average of the timestamp is the
      sum of all the timestamps divided by the total number of packets
      received.  Then difference between averages calculated at two
      monitoring points is the average packet delay on that segment.
      This method is robust to out of order packets and also to packet
      loss (only a small error is introduced).  This method only
      provides single metric for the duration of the block and it
      doesn't give the minimum and maximum delay values.  This
      limitation could be overcome by reducing the duration of the block
      by means of an highly optimized implementation of the method.

4.2.  Double Mark Enabled Measurement

   Double Mark method allows measurement of minimum and maximum delays
   for the monitored flow but it requires more nodal and network
   resources.  If the Double Mark method used, then the S flag MUST be
   used to create the alternate flow, i.e. mark larger batches of
   packets.  The D flag MUST be used to mark single packets to measure
   delay jitter.

   The first marking (S flag alternation) is needed for packet loss and
   also for average delay measurement.  The second marking (D flag is
   put to one) creates a new set of marked packets that are fully
   identified over the BIER network, so that a BFR can store the
   timestamps of these packets; these timestamps can be compared with
   the timestamps of the same packets on a second BFR to compute packet
   delay values for each packet.  The number of measurements can be
   easily increased by changing the frequency of the second marking.
   But the frequency of the second marking must be not too high in order
   to avoid out of order issues.  This method is useful to have not only
   the average delay but also the minimum and maximum delay values and,
   in wider terms, to know more about the statistic distribution of
   delay values.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register format of the OAM field of
   BIER Header as the following:
