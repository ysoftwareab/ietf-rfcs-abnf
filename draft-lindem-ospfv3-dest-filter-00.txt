Abstract

    OSPFv2 has been criticized for it vulnerability to Denial of 
    Service (DOS) attacks. With OSPFv3, it is a simple matter to filter
    on the destination address at an implementation dependent level
    in order to limit the scope of DOS attacks to directly attached 
    routers. Unlike hop limit checking mechanisms, it is compatible 
    with the existing OSPFv3 behavior. Howevr, this level of protection 
    will preclude the deployment of virtual links in topologies where 
    the filtering is applied.

Internet Draft  Graceful OSPF Restart Implementation Report     Feb 2004


1.  Overview

    OSPFv2 [OSPFv2] and OSPFv3 [OSPFv3] both have been criticised for 
    their vulnerability to Denial of Service attacks [VULNER]. Both 
    support cryptographic authentication to prevent an attacker from 
    being able to spoof an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 packet ([OSPFv2] and 
    [AUTHv3]). However, in many cases the MD5 or IPSEC protection 
    actually exacerbates the attack due to the computational overhead 
    involved. For OSPFv3, this document proposes limiting accepted 
    OSPFv3 packets to those that are not routable. Doing so allows 
    these packets to be filtered at a low level for a relatively 
    small computational cost. 

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

2.  Proposed Solution 

    In order to limit the vulnerability to DOS attacks to directly 
    attached routers, OSPFv3 packets are only accepted if the 
    destination address in the packet header is a link-local unicast 
    address or link-local scoped multicast address. Both these address
    types are never forwarded more than one hop. Unlike hop limit 
    checking mechanisms [GTSM], this technique is fully backward 
    compatible with the OSPFv3 which doesn't specify that that 
    OSPFv3 packets be sent with a hop limit of 255. The only hop 
    limit specification is that the link-scoped multicast packets 
    are sent with a hop limit of 1. Hence, this mechanism 
    can be deployed on one OSPFv3 router at a time. 

    In order to make the checking simple and low cost, this document
    suggests checking the first two octets of the IPv6 destination 
    address for a valid link local unicast or link-local scoped 
    multicast address. Based on the IPv6 Address Architecture
    [ADDR-ARCH], this would equate to: 

      if (((first-two-octets & 0xffc0) != 0xfe80) && 
          ((first-two-octets & 0xff0f) != 0xff02)) {
          drop the packet;
      }

2.1 Virtual Links 

    Virtual links make use of a global IPv6 unicast destination address.
    Hence, the propsed destination address filter and virtual links are 
    incompatible. Depending on the granularity of the filtering,
    virtual links may still be used (See Section 3.0).

2.2 Tunnels

    In order to support OSPF over tunnels, e.g. GRE [GRE], it is 
    necessary for the destination filter to be applied after OSPF 
    packets are delivered to the tunnel endpoint and decapsulated. 
    Furthermore, the encapsulated OSPFv3 packet's destination 
    address should be AlllSPFRouters (FF02::5). 

3.0 Implementation Placement and Granularity of Filter

    The placement and granularity of the destination address filter 
    is an engineering decision that must be made for each 
    implementation. Obviously, the sooner it is done after packet 
    reception the less resource that is consumed processing packets
    that will be dropped. However, since the checking has to be
    confined to OSPFv3 packets that are delivered locally it may be 
    easier to delay the checking until the packets  have been identified
    as such. A conveinent place in an implementation using the BSD
    socket model [SOCKET] is the point at which an inbound packet
    is added to the OSPFv3 socket.

    The granularity of the check will limit the usage of virtual 
    links at the granularity which it is applied. For example, if it is
    applied at the BSD socket level, virtual links may not be used 
    by any OSPF instance utilizing that socket. Alternately, additional
    configuration and checking could be added at the socket level so
    that the destination filter is only applied to certain instances,
    areas, or interfaces. Implemenations will need to balance their
    market requirements for virtual link deployment. In any case, the 
    use of virtual link SHOULD be allowed either by configuration or
    the filter should be automatically disabled when a virtual link 
    is configured. 
    
4. RIPng Applicability

    The destination filter described herein is also applicable to 
    RIPng [RIPNG]. The filter simply needs to be applied to UDP port 
    521. In RIPng there is no concept of a virtual link and no 
    requirement to send to IPv6 global addresses.

5. Security Considerations

   This document recommends a mechanism that can be used to limit 
   OSPFv3 Denial of Service (DOS) attacks to directly attached networks.
   Hence, the entire document deals with security.
