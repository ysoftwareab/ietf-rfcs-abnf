1.  Introduction

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a mechanism for network
   traffic to go through a set of Service Functions in sequence.
   Network Service Header (NSH) allows metadata to be shared between
   Service Functions along with the packets.  Such metadata is carried
   by either a fixed number of 32-bit context headers (MD-Type 1) or a
   variable number of TLVs (MD-Type 2), as defined in NSH
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh].  This document provides a recommended default
   allocation of the fixed size context headers for network security
   Service Functions forming a Service Function Chain.  The allocation
   may also form a MD-Type 2 metadata TLV.  Supporting use cases for a
   metadata definition in this context are described in SFC-NS-Use-Cases
   [I-D.wang-sfc-ns-use-cases] . This document does not define any other
   variable TLVs.  It does not address the control plane mechanisms.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

3.  Network Service Header (NSH) Context Headers

   NSH MD-Type 1 is composed of three parts as described in
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh]: a 4-byte base header, a 4-byte service path
   header, and four 4-byte mandatory context headers.

4.  Recommended Security Mandatory Context Allocation

   The following context header allocation provides information used to
   support SFC operation within a generic network security environment.
   The 16-byte context headers are used to deliver metadata and
   classification results between security Service Functions.  Service
   Functions may use the metadata for local policy enforcement, security
   actions, classification refinement, and other functionality.

Internet-Draft  NSH Context Header Allocation (Security)       June 2017


4.1.  Network Security Allocation Specifics

   The specific 16-byte allocation of the mandatory context headers is
   as follows:

      Session ID: Session ID is used to identify a particular
      connection, transaction, or any unit that the security Service
      Functions use to maintain states.  Session ID may be used to
      associate a packet with existing states even if the packet does
      not contain all the network headers for deriving the Session ID,
      or if the network headers are modified by a Service Function.  It
      may appear in events and logs for correlation between Service
      Functions in the SFC-domain.

      The Session SHOULD be bi-directional so that both directions of
      Service Paths are associated with the same Service Function
      instance.  Service Path reclassification for the same session MUST
      not change the Session ID.

      Flag bits of the 2nd word:



         D bit: The D-bit is used to indicate whether the Destination
         Class field in the 3rd word is used.  If D-bit is not set then
         the 3rd word is reserved.

         P bit: The P-bit is set to 1 if the session indicated by
         Session ID is classified as a parent connection among all
         sessions under the particular application session ID.  Examples
         of parent connection are FTP control connection and SIP
         signaling connection.

      Application Session ID: Application Session ID is unique for every
      set of sessions that belong to the same application session.  For
      example, there could be four HTTP connections (session IDs 0x1,
      0x2, 0x3, and 0x4) and two application sessions (0xA and 0xB) of
      type "App-X".  Sessions 0x1 and 0x2 correspond to application
      session 0xA, and Sessions 0x3 and 0x4 correspond to session 0xB.
      Application Session ID helps Service Functions handle related
      sessions in a holistic manner for operations such as inspection,
      security analysis and QoS.

      Destination Class: The destination class represents the logical
      classification of the destination of the traffic.  This field is
      optional and/or the Destination Class may not be known.  The D-bit
      is used to indicate that this field contains a valid Destination
      Class.

      Source Class: represents the logical classification of the source
      of the traffic.  For example, this might represent a source
      application, a group of like endpoints, or a set of users
      originating the traffic.  Class may also be a compound
      classification, for example, combination of network zone and group
      of users.  This grouping is done for the purposes of applying
      policy.  Policy is applied to groups rather than individual
      endpoints.

      Offload Control Flags: The 4th word contains flags to control the
      desired behavior of SFC offload.  The definitions of these flags
      B, U, T & D are described in [I-D.kumar-sfc-offloads]

      Tenant ID: The tenant identifier is used to represent the tenant
      or security policy domain that the Service Function Chain is being
      applied to.  The Tenant ID is a unique value assigned by a control
      plane.

      The 4th word also contains security classification results for
      communicating immediate actions and accumulated verdicts to
      downstream Service Functions.

      Score: Security Score is a numeric value for participating Service
      Functions to deliver security classification results based on
      their processing of the packet data.  The Score value may be set
      by one Service Function and refined by a subsequent Service
      Function to produce an accumulated result.  Alternatively, each
      Service Function may set a different score value which is
      collected by a control point.  The Score value is interpreted
      consistently in the SFC-domain.  For example, a Score value of -5
      may trigger additional scanning functions to be conducted by the
      subsequent Service Function for the Session.  As another example,
      a Score value -20 may result in block of the source or destination
      host by a Service Function.  The interpretation of the Score is
      distributed by a control plane and is outside the scope of the
      document.

5.  Context Allocation and Control Plane Considerations

   This document describes an allocation scheme for the NSH context
   headers in the context of network security SFC use cases.

   The suggested allocation in this document would be considered as a
   guideline only.  Some of the allocated fields are specific to certain
   use cases.  A control plane mechanism is required to ensure
   consistency among the SFC components participating in the allocation
   scheme.  The actual control plane mechanism is out of the scope of
   this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   The SFC control plane responsible for identifying and distributing
   the allocation scheme should ensure the communication mechanism is
   secure.

   The metadata defined in this document carries important information
   for participating Service Functions to make security policy
   decisions.  Some of the metadata such as the security score may be
   accumulated before a Service Function takes an action.  There is a
   risk that the metadata may be intercepted or even spoofed by an
   unauthorized party.  Proper precaution must be taken to ensure the
   confidentiality and integrity of the metadata fields.
