1.  Introduction

   [RFC5988] describes a typed link framework for relating resources on
   the Web (and more generally on the Internet).  It does this by
   specifying a formal syntax for a Link header to be used in HTTP
   [RFC7230] and by establishing an IANA registry for link
   relationships.

   The LINK resource record described in this document re-uses the tags
   and values of the HTTP Link header described in [RFC5988] but with a
   simplified syntax for compactness and use of multiple records in a
   DNS resource record set (RRSET).  By making link information
   available in the DNS, applications may perform link mapping outside
   of HTTP.  Additionally, since the Link data uses other common
   application building blocks such as URIs [RFC3986] and media types,
   the use of this link information can be much broader than HTTP with
   other application protocols.

   The following is a simple LINK example which links "icon.png" as the
   icon for example.com.

   example.com. IN LINK "http://example.com/icon.png r=icon"

                                 Figure 1

   The following is a LINK example instructing search engines not to
   follow a specific link.

   example.com. IN LINK "http://example.com/ r=nofollow"

   In the following example, links are given for example.com based on a
   natural language preference.

   example.com.
   IN LINK "http://en.example.com/ hl=en"
   IN LINK "http://es.example.com/ hl=es"
   IN LINK "http://fr.example.com/ hl=fr"

                                 Figure 3

   In the following example, links are given for a RESTful service in
   both an XML and JSON format.

   restful.example.com.
   IN LINK "http://example.com/rest-xml t=application/foo+xml"
   IN LINK "http://example.com/rest-json t=application/foo+json"

2.  Format

   The format of the LINK resource record is the same as the TXT
   resource record, except the resource record name is LINK.  The
   resource record data consists of character-strings.  When these
   character-strings are concatenated they take the form of:

      URI tag1=value1 tag2=value2 ...

   The ABNF for the final character string concatenation is:

   tagchar     = ( DIGIT / ALPHA )
   tag         = *tagchar
   quotedvalue = %x27 *(VCHAR / WSP ) %x27
   tagvalue    = tag "=" VCHAR / quotedvalue
   linkdata    = URI 1*SP tagvalue *( 1*SP tagvalue )
                 ; URI is defined in RFC 3986

   Each tag value pair is separated by space, and the values do not need
   to be quoted unless they contain space characters.  Tags are defined
   in Section 3.

3.  Tags

   This document defines the following tags for the LINK RR.  Future
   specification of tags is possible, therefore applications MUST ignore
   unknown tags.  All of the tags below reference a tag from [RFC5988].

   1.  r - matches "rel"

   2.  v - matches "rev"

   3.  hl - matches "hreflang"

   4.  m - matches "media"

   5.  t - matches "type"

   6.  tt - matches "title", only one may appear per LINK record

   7.  tl - refers the language of the title, only one may appear per
       LINK record and must be accompanied by a tl tag in the same LINK
       record

   Becaue multiple LINK records may be specified, the restrictions upon
   the tt and tl tags gives the same functionality as the title and
   title* tags from [RFC5988].

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA will need to assign a value for the LINK record type.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   The LINK record allows referenced links and titles to links to be
   given language tags with the tl and hl record tags, respectively.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Information in the DNS is publicly visible to all parties on the
   Internet.  While visibility of the HTTP Link header can be
   constrained via HTTP access methods, visibility of the LINK record
   cannot.  Care should be taken that information available in an HTTP
   Link header is appropriate for public visibility once translated into
   a LINK record.

Appendix A.  Design Considerations

   In designing the format for the LINK record, the author considered a
   record specific RDATA format and presentation format using a simple
   tag-length-value (TLV) construction.  Such a design has the advantage
   of mapping the same [RFC5988] tags to numeric codes and potentially
   avoids escaping issues with quoted strings.

   The decision to use space separated key-value pairs inside character
   strings was instead chosen to better aid adoption.  With this method,
   libraries need only re-use the TXT record construct at the bare
   minimum, and in more complete cases couuld offer a richer interface
   while using simple space delimited token parsing of the character
   strings.

   In the event that this design is found to be problematic or lacking
   the ease-of-adoption desired, the author believe moving to a TLV
   design is semantically compatible and easily achieved.

   Re-use of the exact syntax of the Link header was also considered.
   However, that syntax is not as simple as desired because of the
   nature of how headers are embedded in HTTP and the need for backwards
   compatibility with a previously deprecated version of the Link
   header.  Therefore a simplified, space delimited syntax is used.

Appendix B.  Relevance to U-NAPTR and the URI Record Type

   Placement of URIs in the DNS is not a new idea, but it has yet to
   have found significant usage.

   U-NAPTR [RFC4848] is a method for using NAPTR records to resolve URIs
   in the DNS using application service keywords and application
   protocol or transport protocol keywords.

   [I-D.faltstrom-uri] defines the URI resource record which can be used
   without further domain name qualification or with NAPTR records as
   described by [RFC3958] to achieve the same service/protocol keyword
   resolution as U-NAPTR [RFC4848].

   In practice, the need for service/protocol keyword resolution by
   applications is usually irrelevant and can be redundant or conflict
   with the scheme of the target URI.  Additionally, both U-NAPTR
   [RFC4848] and [I-D.faltstrom-uri] offer a weight and order sorting
   mechanism which is seldom ever needed but adds confusion to the
   administration of these DNS resource records.

   The approach used by this document is to offer applications the
   ability to reference information about a URI and the target of the
   URI as is commonly used on the Internet, especially in web-based
   protocols.
