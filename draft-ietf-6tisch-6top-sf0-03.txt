               6TiSCH 6top Scheduling Function Zero (SF0)
                     draft-ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0-03

Abstract

   This document defines a Scheduling Function called "Scheduling
   Function Zero" (SF0).  SF0 dynamically adapts the number of allocated
   cells between neighbor nodes, based on the amount of currently
   allocated cells and the neighbor nodes' cell requirements.  Neighbor
   nodes negotiate in a distributed neighbor-to-neighbor basis the
   number of cell(s) to be added/deleted.  SF0 uses the 6P signaling
   messages to add/delete cells in the schedule.  This function selects
   the candidate cells from the schedule, defines which cells will be
   added/deleted and triggers the allocation/deallocation process.

1.  TEMPORARY EDITORIAL NOTES

   This document is an Internet Draft, so it is work-in-progress by
   nature.  It contains the following work-in-progress elements:

   o  "TODO" statements are elements which have not yet been written by
      the authors for some reason (lack of time, ongoing discussions
      with no clear consensus, etc).  The statement does indicate that
      the text will be written at some time.
   o  "TEMPORARY" appendices are there to capture current ongoing
      discussions, or the changelog of the document.  These appendices
      will be removed in the final text.
   o  "IANA_" identifiers are placeholders for numbers assigned by IANA.
      These placeholders are to be replaced by the actual values they
      represent after their assignment by IANA.
   o  The string "REMARK" is put before a remark (questions, suggestion,
      etc) from an author, editor of contributor.  These are on-going
      discussions at the time to writing, NOT part of the final text.
   o  This section will be removed in the final text.

2.  Introduction

   This document defines a minimal Scheduling Function for the 6top
   sublayer [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol], called "Scheduling Function
   Zero" (SF0).  SF0 is designed to offer the minimal set of
   functionalities to be usable in a wide range of applications.  SF0
   defines two algorithms: The Scheduling Algorithm defines the number
   of cells to allocate/delete between two neighbours and the relocation
   algorithm defines when to relocate a cell.

   The Scheduling Algorithm: A number of TX and/or RX cells must be
   allocated between neighbor nodes in order to enable data transmission
   among them.  A portion of these allocated cells will be utilized by
   neighbors, while the remaining cells can be over-provisioned to
   handle unanticipated increases in cell requirements.  The Scheduling
   Algorithm collects the cell allocation/deletion requests from the
   neighbors and the number of cells which are currently under usage.
   First, the Cell Estimation Algotithm calculates the number of
   required cells by adding the collected values and second, the
   calculated value is given to the Allocation Policy, which provides
   stability by adding hystheresis and overprovisioning by deciding when
   to schedule the new number of cells, according to a threshold.  In
   order to reduce consumption, this algorithm is triggered only when
   there is a change on the number of effectively used cells or if there
   is a change on the number of requested cells from a particular node.

   The Relocation Algorithm: Allocated cells may experience packet loss
   from different sources, such as noise, interference or cell collision

   (after the same cell is allocated by other nodes in range on the
   network).  In order to avoid this problem, Packet Delivery Rate (PDR)
   is monitored periodically for each allocated cell.  A relocation is
   triggered when the PDR value drops below a certain threshold,
   compared to the average PDR of the rest of allocated cells.  The
   destination location on the schedule is defined randomly.

   To synthesize, a node running SF0 determines when to add/delete cells
   in a three-step process:

   1.  It waits for a triggering event (Section 4).
   2.  It applies the Cell Estimation Algorithm (CEA) for a particular
       neighbor to determine how many cells are required to that
       neighbor (Section 5).
   3.  It applies the Allocation Policy to compare the number of
       required cells to the number of already scheduled cells, and
       determines the number of cells to add/delete (Section 6).

   We expect additional SFs, offering more functionalities for a more
   specific use case, to be defined in future documents.  SF0 addresses
   the requirements for a scheduling function listed in Section 5.2 from
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol], and follows the recommended outline
   listed in Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol].  This
   document follows the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology].

3.  Scheduling Function Identifier

   The Scheduling Function Identifier (SFID) of SF0 is IANA_SFID_SF0.

4.  SF0 Triggering Events

   We RECOMMEND SF0 to be triggered at least by the following events:

   1.  If there is a change in the current number of required cells
   2.  If there is a successful cell allocation/deallocation process
       with the neighbour.

   This allows SF0 to be triggered by any change in locally generated or
   incoming traffic.  The exact mechanism of when SF0 is triggered is
   implementation-specific.

5.  SF0 Cell Estimation Algorithm

   The Cell Estimation Algorithm takes into account the new incoming
   cell requirements from the neighbor node and the current outgoing
   number of used cells.  This allows the algorithm to estimate a new




Dujovne, et al.        Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               6tisch-6top-sf0                  March 2017


   number of cells to be allocated.  As a consequence, the Cell
   Estimation Algorithm for SF0 follows the steps described below:

   1.  Collect the current number of used cells
   2.  Calculate the new number of cells to be allocated by adding the
       current number of used cells plus an OVERPROVISION number of
       cells
   3.  Submit the request to the allocation policy as REQUIREDCELLS
   4.  Return to step 1 and wait for a triggering event.

   The OVERPROVISION parameter is a percentage of the currently
   allocated cells which is added to the used cells to guarantee that
   the growth on the number of used cells can be detected without packet
   loss.  This percentage value is implementation-specific.  A value of
   OVERPROVISION equal to zero leads to queue growth and possible packet
   loss, since there are no overprovisioned cells to detect if there is
   a growth on the number of used cells.

6.  SF0 Allocation Policy

   The "Allocation Policy" is the set of rules used by SF0 to decide
   when to add/delete cells to a particular neighbor to satisfy the cell
   requirements.

   SF0 uses the following parameters:

   SCHEDULEDCELLS:  The number of cells scheduled from the current node
      to a particular neighbor.
   REQUIREDCELLS:  The number of cells calculated by the Cell Estimation
      Algorithm from the current node to that neighbor.
   SF0THRESH:  Threshold parameter introducing cell over-provisioning in
      the allocation policy.  It is a non-negative value expressed as
      number of cells.  The definition of this value is implementation-
      specific.  A setting of SF0THRESH>0 will cause the node to
      allocate at least SF0THRESH cells to each of its' neighbors.

   The SF0 allocation policy compares REQUIREDCELLS with SCHEDULEDCELLS
   and decides to add/delete cells taking into account SF0THRESH.  This
   is illustrated in Figure 1.  The number of cells to be scheduled/
   deleted is out of the scope of this document and it is
   implementation-dependent.

   1.  If REQUIREDCELLS<(SCHEDULEDCELLS-SF0THRESH), delete one or more
       cells.
   2.  If (SCHEDULEDCELLS-SF0THRESH)<=REQUIREDCELLS<=SCHEDULEDCELLS, do
       nothing.
   3.  If SCHEDULEDCELLS<=REQUIREDCELLS, add one or more cells.

   When SF0THRESH equals 0, any discrepancy between REQUIREDCELLS and
   SCHEDULEDCELLS triggers an action to add/delete cells.  Positive
   values of SF0THRESH reduce the number of 6P Transactions.

7.  Rules for CellList

   There are two methods to define the CellList: The Whitelist method,
   which fills the CellList with the number of proposed cells to the
   neighbour, and the Blacklist, which fills the CellList with the cells
   which cannot be used by the neighbour.  The rule to select the method
   is implementation-specific.  When issuing a 6top ADD Request, SF0
   executes the following sequence:

      Whitelist case:

         The Transaction Source node: Prepares the CellList field by
         selecting randomly the required cells, verifying that the slot

         offset and channel offset are not occupied and choose
         channelOffset randomly for each cell.
         The Transaction Destination node: Goes through the cells in the
         CellList in order, verifying whether there are no slotOffset
         conflicts.
      Blacklist case:

         The Transaction Source node: Prepares the CellList field by
         building a list of currently scheduled cells into the CellList.
         The Transaction Destination node: Selects randomly the required
         cells from the unallocated cells on the schedule, verifying
         that the slot offset and channel offset are not occupied from
         the ones on the CellList.

8.  6P Timeout Value

   The general timeout equals the equivalent time of the number of slots
   until the next scheduled cell.  TODO/REMARK: The exact calculation is
   currently under discussion on the Mailing List.

9.  Meaning of Metadata Information

   The Metadata 16-bit field is used as follows:

      BITS 0-7 [SLOTFRAME] are used to identify the slotframe number
      BITS 8-14 are RESERVED
      BIT 15 [WBLIST] is used to indicate that the CellList provided is
      a Whitelist (value=0) or a Blacklist (value=1).

10.  Node Behavior at Boot

   In order to define a known state after the node is restarted, a CLEAR
   command is issued to each of the neighbor nodes to enable a new
   allocation process.  The 6P Initial Timeout Value provided by SF0
   should allow for the maximum number of TSCH link-layer retries, as
   defined by Section 4.3.4 of [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol].  TODO/
   REMARK: The initial timeout is currently under discussion on the
   Mailing List.

11.  Cell Type

   SF0 uses TX (Transmission) cell type only, thus defining celloptions
   as TX=0, RX=1 and S=0 according to section 4.2.6 of
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol].

Internet-Draft               6tisch-6top-sf0                  March 2017


12.  SF0 Statistics

   Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) is calculated per cell, as the quotient of
   the number of successfully delivered packets to 10, for the last 10
   packet transmission attempts, without counting retransmissions.

13.  Relocating Cells

   SF0 uses Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) statistics to monitor the
   currently allocated cells for cell relocation (by changing their
   slotOffset and/or channelOffset).  When the PDR of one or more
   softcells is below PDR_THRESHOLD, defined as a percentage of the
   average of the PDR of the rest of the scheduled cells, SF0 relocates
   each of the cell(s) to a number of available cells selected randomly.
   PDR_THRESHOLD is out of the scope of this document and it is
   implementation-dependent.

14.  Forced Cell Deletion Policy

   When all the cells are scheduled, we need a policy to free cells, for
   example, under alarm conditions or if a node disappears from the
   neighbor list.  The action to follow this condition is out of scope
   of this document and it is implementation-dependent.

15.  6P Error Handling

   A node implementing SF0 handles a 6P Response depending on the Return
   Code it contains:

   RC_SUCCESS:
      If the number of elements in the CellList is the number of cells
      specified in the NumCells field of the 6P ADD Request, the
      operation is complete.  The node does not take further action.
      If the number of elements in the CellList is smaller (possibly 0)
      than the number of cells specified in the NumCells field of the 6P
      ADD Request, the neighbor has received the request, but less than
      NumCells of the cells in the CellList were allocated.  In that
      case, the node MAY retry immediately with a different CellList if
      the amount of storage space permits, or build a new (random)
      CellList.
   RC_ERR_VER:  The node MUST NOT retry immediately.  The node MAY add
      the neighbor node to a blacklist.  The node MAY retry to contact
      this neighbor later.
   RC_ERR_SFID:  The node MUST NOT retry immediately.  The node MAY add
      the neighbor node to a blacklist.  The node MAY retry to contact
      this neighbor later.
   RC_ERR_GEN:  The node MUST issue a CLEAR command to the neighbour.
   RC_ERR_BUSY:  Wait for a timeout and restart the scheduling process.

   RC_ERR_NORES:  Wait for a timeout and restart the scheduling process.
   RC_ERR_RESET:  Abort 6P Transaction
   RC_ERR:  Abort 6P Transaction.  The node MAY retry to contact this
      neighbor later.

17.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   OpenWSN:  This specification is implemented in the OpenWSN project
      [OpenWSN].  The authors of this document are collaborating with
      the OpenWSN community to gather feedback about the status and
      performance of the protocols described in this document.  Results
      from that discussion will appear in this section in future
      revision of this specification.

   o  SHOULD clearly state the application domain the SF is created for.
      OK
   o  SHOULD contain examples which highlight normal and error
      scenarios.
   o  SHOULD contain a list of current implementations, at least during
      the I-D state of the document, per [RFC6982].
   o  SHOULD contain a performance evaluation of the scheme, possibly
      through references to external documents.
   o  MAY redefine the format of the CellList? field.  OK
