             Multi-Layer OAM for Service function Chaining
                   draft-wang-sfc-multi-layer-oam-01

Abstract

   Since there are different notions of service chain, such as fully
   abstract notion named SFC, half-fully abstraction notion named SFP
   and fully specific notion named RSP, and there are different
   components defined in SFC architecture, it seems reasonable to define
   differentiated OAM for these different service chains.  This document
   tries to discuss the multi-layer OAM requirements in SFC domain and
   provides a multi-layer OAM solution for different service chains.

1.  Introduction

   Since there are different notions of service chain, such as fully
   abstract notion named SFC, half-fully abstraction notion named SFP
   and fully specific notion named RSP, and there are different
   components defined in SFC architecture, it seems reasonable to define
   differentiated OAM for these different service chains.  This document
   tries to discuss the multi-layer OAM requirements in SFC domain and
   provides a multi-layer OAM solution for different service chains.

3.  Requirement

   In fact, besides the link layer OAM, network layer OAM, SFC service
   layer OAM is requisite in SFC Domain, which may be typically
   illustrated in Figure 1.

          |------------SFC Service layer OAM------------|


                  Figure 1: typical SFC service layer OAM

   Currently, according to the latest SFC architecture, we know that
   there are several components defined in the SFC architecture, such as
   SN, SFF, SF,etc, and the relationship between them like this:
   serveral SFs may share the same SFF, and furthermore, serveral SFFs
   may share the same SN(e.g, different SFFs residented in one service
   node belong to different VPNs).  As a result of that, multiple RSPs,
   such as RSP1(SF1--SF3--SF5) and RSP2(SF2--SF4--SF6) in Figure 2, may
   not share the same transmitting path, but they may share the same
   SFFs path.

                    |SF1|  |SF2|     |SF3|  |SF4|     |SF5|  |SF6|

      |Classifier |---|SFF1|-----------|SFF2|-----------|SFF3|
      +-----------+   +----+           +----+           +----+


             Figure 2: different RSPs share the same SFFs path

   And also, multiple SFPs, such as SFP1(SFF1--SFF3--SFF5)(e.g, VPN1)
   and SFP2(SFF2--SFF4--SFF6)(e.g, VPN2) in Figure 3, may not share the
   same SFFs, but they may share the same SNs path.

             Figure 3: different SFPs share the same SNs path

   As for users who want to diagnose, troubleshoot a set of RSPs which
   transmit the same SFFs, or a set of SFPs which transmit the same SNs,
   there is an aggregative method which can aggregate a set of RSPs or a
   set of SFPs into one, then, users only need to diagnose, troubleshoot
   the aggregative one, rather than the separated one by one.  And also,
   if users are willing to diagnose and troubleshoot one by one, once
   the connectivity between different SFs is not OK, users can detect
   the connectivity between different SFFs where the SFs resident
   instead to narrow the failure coverage.  In other words, if the
   connectivity between the detected SFFs is not OK, then the
   connectivity problem is located. if the connectivity betwwen the
   detected SFFs is OK, then the connectivity problem should be between
   the detected SFs and the detected SFFs, which can help to improve the
   efficiency of target location remarkably.  Obviously, they can be
   diagnosed, troubleshooted one by one or aggregatively according to
   preferance.

   As follow, this document tries to provide an architecture and a
   solution for differentiated layer OAM for this requirement.

4.  Multi-layer SFC OAM architecture

   Figure 4 is a possible architecture for multi-layer SFC OAM.  In this
   figure, it tries to figure out three possible layers.  The layer 1 is
   the most aggregative layer for service chain.  It stretches the path
   which SNs go through according to the sets of RSPs or SFPs or SFCs.
   The layer 2 is the medium aggregative layer for service chain.  It
   outlines the path which SFFs go though according to the sets of RSPs
   or SFPs or SFCs.  The layer 3 is the specific path for service chain.
   It is exactly the path which SFs go though according to the sets of
   RSPs or SFPs or SFCs.
