 1. Status of this Memo
 
 This draft, file name draft-manning-dsua-00.txt, is intended to become
 something that might be of use to those who are interested in the
 operational requirements of an IPv4 based network.  Distribution of 
 this document is unlimited. Comments should be sent to the author.
 
 This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
 documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
 and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
 working documents as Internet-Drafts.
 
 Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
 and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
 time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
 material or to cite them other than as "work in progress".

 2. PREAMBLE:
 
 This document lists the existent special use prefixes from the IPv4 space 
 and provides some suggestions for operational procedures when these 
 prefixes are encountered.  This document does not address IPv4 space that
 is reserved for future delegation in the operational Internet.
 
 The current list of special use prefixes:
 
 	0.0.0.0/8	
 	127.0.0.0/8
 	192.0.2.0/24
 	10.0.0.0/8
 	172.16.0.0/12
 	192.168.0.0/16
 	169.254.0.0/16
 
 2.1 Prefix Discussion:
 
 0.0.0.0/8 has a number of unique properties, many of which were built into
 the protocol stacks used throughout the Internet.  0.0.0.0/32 or the all-zeros
 address has been used and is still recognized as the historical broadcast
 address. This use or restriction is depricated and modern code will treat
 broadcast correctly as an all-ones value within the subnet. 
 
 Also, many stacks will allow the system administrator to encode IP addresses
 of the form 0.0.160.57, with the presumption that historical, "natural" masks
 apply and so this would represent a host that carries the local value of
 160.57 within the /16 netblock that is in use on that media. These properties 
 suggest that a prudent network manager & system admin will treat 0.0.0.0/8
 as a special use netblock. Router and Host requirements documents and 
 implementations treat this range with special use constraints.
 
 127.0.0.0/8 is earmarked for what is called "loopback". This construct is 
 to allow a node to test/validate its IP stack.  Most software only uses
 a single value from this range, 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback purposes.  It
 is treated with the same levels of restriction by router and host requirements
 and implementations so it is difficult to use any other addresses within 
 this block for anything other than node specific applications, generally 
 bootstraping.  All in all a tremendous waste of IP space. Good thing we'll 
 not likely need it.
 
 192.0.2.0/24 is listed as the TEST-NET. This prefix is earmarked for use in 
 documentation and example code. Network operations and End System 
 administrators should ensure that this prefix is not coded into systems
 or routed through any infrastructure.  Since it has the appearance of a
 "normal" prefix, special precautions should be taken to ensure that this
 prefix is not propagated in either the Internet or any private networks
 that use the IP protocols.  Often used in conjunction with example.com
 or example.net in vendor and protocol documentation.
 
 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 are the prefixes called out
 in RFC 1918. They are only for use in private networks that wish to use
 the IP protocols. Network operations and End System administrators should 
 ensure that these prefixes is not coded into systems or routed through any 
 Internet infrastructure.  Since they have the appearance of "normal" prefixes, 
 special precautions should be taken to ensure that they are not propagated 
 in the Internet. 
 
 169.254.0.0/16 has been ear-marked as the IP range to use for end node 
 autoconfiguration when a DHCP server may not be found. As such, network
 operations and administrators should be VERY aggressive in ensuring that
 neither route advertisements nor packet forwarding should occur across
 any media boundaries. This is true for the Internet as well as any
 private networks that use the IP protocols. End node administrators
 should be aware that some vendors will autoconfigure and add this
 prefix to the nodes forwarding table. This will cause problems with
 sites that run router discovery or depricated routing protocols such as
 RIP.
 
 As a side note, at least one vendor has hijacked an address range for
 use by its printservers. That range is 192.0.0.0/24 and the specific
 address that they use is 192.0.0.192/32.  This is not a valid delegation
 to this vendor and its use argues for reconstitution of this service
 into the link-local range or configurable with site delegated space.
 
 3. DNS considerations:
 
 None of these address prefixes is to be used or visible on the public Internet.
 In fact, some of these prefixes must not appear outside the machine. To 
 encourage honesty, most of these prefixes have been mapped into the
 DNS. This encourages people to ensure that when used, these prefixes are
 coded with local-scope DNS and there will be no "leakage" to the 
 global Internet.
 
 4. Access Control suggestions:
 
 In todays network, it is prudent to control access. In the case of these
 special use prefixes, it is generally a good idea to filter them so they
 do not propagate. After all, you don't want someone else's use of these
 prefixes to taint your environment.  An example of one form of access
 control is listed below:
 
 ...
 access-list 100 deny   ip host 0.0.0.0 any
 access-list 100 deny   ip 127.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 255.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
 access-list 100 deny   ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 255.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
 access-list 100 deny   ip 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 255.240.0.0 0.15.255.255
 access-list 100 deny   ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 255.255.0.0 0.0.255.255
 access-list 100 deny   ip 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.255
 access-list 100 deny   ip 169.254.0.0 0.0.255.255 255.255.0.0 0.0.255.255
 access-list 100 permit ip any any
 ...
 
 
 5. Security Considerations:
 
 Use of most of these special use prefixes open up significant opportunities 
 for anonymity and ambiguity. People being what they are, will hide behind 
 ambiguous or nebulous identities to do things that are antisocial and 
 downright hostile. It would be nice to have better authentication methods
 in play than an IP address which has lost its global uniqueness.
