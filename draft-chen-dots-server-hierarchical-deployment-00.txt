           draft-chen-dots-server-hierarchical-deployment-00

Abstract

   As DOTS is used for DDoS Mitigation signaling, In practice, there are
   different deployment scenarios for DOTS agents deployment depending
   on the network deployment mode.  This document made an accommandation
   for DOTS Server deployment which may be Suitable for ISP.  The goal
   is to provide some guidance for DOTS agents deployment.

1.  Introduction

   DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is a protocol to standardize real-
   time signaling, threat-handling
   requests[I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel], when attack target is under
   attack, dots client send mitigation request to dots server for help,
   If the mitigation request contains enough messages of the attack,
   then the mitigator can respond very effectively.

   In the architecture draft[I-D.ietf-dots-architecture], it is says
   that this does not necessarily imply that the attack target and the
   DOTS client have to be co-located in the same administrative domain,
   but it is expected to be a common scenario.  Although co-location of
   DOTS server and mitigator within the same domain is expected to be a
   common deployment model, it is assumed that operators may require
   alternative models.

   In the DOTS server discovery draft[I-D.ietf-dots-server-discovery],
   it is says that a key point in the deployment of DOTS is the ability
   of network operators to be able to onfigure DOTS clients with the
   correct DOTS server(s) nformation consistently.

   In the DOTS multihoming draft[I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming], it provides
   deployment recommendations for DOTS client and DOTS gateway, it is
   says when conveying a mitigation request to protect the attack
   target, the DOTS client among the DOTS servers available Must select
   a DOTS server whose network has assigned the prefixes from which
   target prefixes and target IP addresses are derived.  This implies
   that id no appropriate DOTS server is found, the DOTS client must not
   send the mitigation request to any DOTS server.  So in this document,

   we give some dots server deployment consideration as the title
   suggests we prefer hierarchical deployment.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119]

   The readers should be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements] [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases]

   The terminology related to YANG data modules is defined in [RFC7950]

   In addition, this document uses the terms defined below:

   dots svr:  abbreviation of dots server.

   ISP:  Internet service provider.

3.  DOTS server Considerations

   When take dots server deployment into consideration, one thing must
   be involved is mitigator.so far, how many network devices can play
   the role of mitigator, we make a summerized list as follows:

   o  Router.

   o  Special cleaning equipment, such as Flow clean device and clean
      center.

   o  Network security equipment, such as firewall,IPS and WAF

   Whether DOTS server can be deployed, the following conditions need to
   be met:

   o  DOTS server has to interconnected with mitigator

   o  DOTS server can go directly to the mitigator which had best go
      through without any other DOTS agents

   o  DOTS server has the permissions for scheduling and operations on
      mitigator

   o  DOTS server has the ability to know the address of attack target
      belong to which mitigator

4.  DOTS server deployment inside an ISP

   From the internal structure of ISP, the whole network can divide into
   three parts logically.  There are three most important routers:
   backbone router, man(metropolitan area network) router, and IDC
   router.  When a ddos attack occurs, it must be one of the three cases
   as follows, and the corresponding mitigator will responsible for
   mitigation.

   o  only the lan network detected the attack, dots server3 will
      receive mitigation request, and mitigator3 will act as the first
      responsible mitigator.

   o  only the man network detected the attack, dots server2 will
      receive mitigation request, then mitigator2 will act as the first
      responsible mitigator.

   o  only the backbone network detected the attack, dots server1 will
      receive mitigation request, then mitigator1 will act as the first
      responsible mitigator.

   o  Attacks on the same attack target are found both in adjacent
      areas, the upper network mitigator will act as the first
      responsible mitigator. for example, dots server1 and dots server2
      both received the mitigation request from attack target by dots
      client, mitigator1 will responsible for ddos disposition(priority
      ranking: mitigator1 > mitigator2 > mitigator3).

5.  DOTS server deployment between ISPs

   The coexistence of different operators is very common, coordination
   between operators across networks is very important.  Interdomain
   attacks occur frequently, We recommend deploying the DOTS server at
   the access point

   o  DDoS attack from one of other ISPs, for example, ISP A received
      DDoS attack from ISP B or ISP C, then dots server C or dots server
      B will receive the mitigation request.

   o  DDOS attack from two or more of other ISPs,for example, ISP A and
      ISP B both start ddos attack to ISP C, then dots server A and dots
      server B will both receive mitigation request from dots client C.
