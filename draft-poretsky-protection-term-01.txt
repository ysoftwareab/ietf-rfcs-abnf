Abstract
   This document provides common terminology and metrics for 
   benchmarking the performance of sub-IP layer protection mechanisms.
   The performance benchmarks are measured at the IP-Layer, so avoid 
   dependence on  specific sub-IP protections mechanisms.  The benchmarks 
   and terminology can be applied in methodology documents for different 
   sub-IP layer protection mechanisms such as Automatic Link Protection 
   (APS) for SONET/SDH, Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) for Ethernet, and 
   Fast Reroute for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS).

INTERNET-DRAFT     Protection Performance Terminology       February 2006

1. Introduction
   The IP network layer provides route convergence to protect data 
   traffic against planned and unplanned failures in the internet.
   Fast convergence times are critical to maintain reliable network 
   connectivity and performance.  Technologies that function at sub-IP 
   layers can be enabled to provide further protection of IP 
   traffic by providing the failure recovery at the sub-IP layers so 
   that the outage is not observed at the IP-layer.  Such technologies 
   include High Availability (HA) stateful failover.  Virtual Router 
   Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Automatic Link Protection (APS) for 
   SONET/SDH, Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) for Ethernet, and Fast 
   Reroute for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS).  
   
   Benchmarking terminology and methodology have been defined for 
   IP-layer route convergence [7,8,9].  New terminology and 
   methodologies specific to benchmarking sub-IP layer protection 
   mechanisms are required.  This will enable different implementations 
   of the same protection mechanisms to be benchmarked and evaluated.  
   In addition, different protection mechanisms can be benchmarked and 
   evaluated.  The metrics for benchmarking the performance of sub-IP 
   protection mechanisms are measured at the IP layer, so that the 
   results are always measured in reference to IP and independent of 
   the specific protection mechanism being used. The purpose of this 
   document is to provide a single terminology for benchmarking sub-IP 
   protection mechanisms.  It is intended that there can exist unique 
   methodology documents for each sub-IP protection mechanism.
   
   Figure 1 shows the fundamental model that is to be used in 
   benchmarking sub-IP protection mechanisms.  Protection Switching 
   consists of a minimum of two Protection-Switching Nodes with a 
   Primary Path and a Backup Path.  A Failover Event occurs along the 
   Primary Path.  A tester is set outside the two nodes as it sends 
   and receives IP traffic along the Working Path.  The Working Path 
   is the Primary Path prior to the Failover Event and the Backup Path 
   following the Failover Event.  If Reversion is supported then the

   Working Path is the Primary Path after Failure Recovery.  The 
   tester MUST record the IP packet sequence numbers, departure time, 
   and arrival time so that the metrics of Failover Time, Additive 
   Latency, and Reversion Time can be measured.  The Tester may be a
   single device or a test system.

2.  Existing definitions

   This document draws on existing terminology defined in other BMWG
   work.  Examples include, but are not limited to:

        Latency                   [RFC 1242, section 3.8]
        Frame Loss Rate           [RFC 1242, section 3.6]
        Throughput                [RFC 1242, section 3.17]
        Device Under Test (DUT)   [RFC 2285, section 3.1.1]
        System Under Test (SUT)   [RFC 2285, section 3.1.2]
        Out-of-order Packet       [Ref.[4], section 3.3.2]
        Duplicate Packet          [Ref.[4], section 3.3.3]

   This document adopts the definition format in Section 2 of RFC 1242.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3. Term definitions

  3.1 Path
  3.1.1 Path

    Definition:
        A sequence of nodes, <R1, ..., Rn>, with the following
        properties:
        - R1 is the ingress node and forwards IP packets, which input
        into DUT/SUT, to R2 as sub-IP frames.
        - Ri is a node which forwards data frames to R[i+1] for all i,
        1<i<n, based on information in the sub-IP layer.
        - Rn is the egress node and it outputs sub-IP frames from
        DUT/SUT as IP packets.

    Discussion:
        The path is defined in the sub-IP layer in this document, unlike
        an IP path in RFC 2026.  For example, the SONET/SDH path, the
        label switched path for MPLS, and optical path.  One path may be
        regarded as being equivalent to one IP link between two IP
        nodes, i.e., R1 and Rn.  The two IP nodes may have multiple
        paths for protection.  A packet will travel on only one path
        between the nodes.  Packets belonging to a microflow (RFC 2474)
        will transverse one or more paths.  The path is unidirectional.

    Measurement units:
        n/a

INTERNET-DRAFT     Protection Performance Terminology       February 2006


    Issues:
        "A bidirectional path", which transmits traffic in both
        directions along the same nodes, consists of two unidirectional
        paths.  Therefore, the two unidirectional paths belonging to
        "one bidirectional path" will be treated independently when
        benchmarking for " a bidirectional path".

    See Also:


  3.1.2 Working Path

    Definition:
        The path that the DUT/SUT is currently using to forward packets.

    Discussion:
        A Primary Path is a Working Path before occurrence of a 
        Failover Event.  A Backup Path becomes the Working Path 
        after a Failover Event.

    Definition:
        The preferred path for forwarding traffic between two or more 
        nodes.

  3.1.5 Backup Path

    Definition:
        A path that exists to carry data traffic only if a Failover 
        Event occurs.

    Discussion:
        The Backup Path is the Working Path upon a Failover Event. 
        There are various types of Backup Paths: a dedicated recovery
        path (1+1), which has 100% redundancy for a specific ordinary
        path, a shared Backup Path (1:N), which is dedicated to the
        protection for more than one specific Primary Path, and an
        associated shared Backup Path (M:N) for which a specific set
        of Backup Paths protects a specific set of more than one
        Primary Path.

  3.1.6 Standby Backup Path  

    Definition:
        A Backup Path that is established prior to a Failover Event
        to protect a Primary Path.

  3.2.1 Protection Switching System

    Definition:
        A SUT that is capable of Failover from a Primary to a Backup 
        Path.

    Discussion:
        The Protection Switching System MUST have a Primary Path and a 
        Backup Path.  The Backup Path MAY be a Standby Backup Path or 
        a Dymanic Backup Path.  The Protection Switching System includes 
        the mechanisms for both Failure Detection and Failover.

  3.2.2 Link Protection  

    Definition:
        A Backup Path that provides protection for link failure.

    Discussion:
        Link Protection may or may not protect the entire Primary Path.

  3.2.3 Node Protection  

    Definition:
        A Backup Path that provides protection for failure of a single node 
        and its directly connected links.

    Discussion:
        Node Protection may or may not protect the entire Primary Path.  
        Node Protection also provides Link Protection.

    Definition:
        A Backup Path that provides protection for the entire Primary Path.

    Discussion:
        Path Protection provides Node Protection and Link Protection for 
        every node and link along the Primary Path.  A Backup Path 
        providing Path Protection MUST have the same ingress node as the
        Primary Path.

        To identify a Primary Path failure at a sub-IP layer.  

    Discussion:
        Failure Detection occurs at the ingress node of the Primary 
        Path.  Failure Dection occurs via a sub-IP mechanism such
        as detection of a link down event or timeout for receipt
        of a control packet.

  3.3.2 Failover Event 

    Definition:
	The occurrence of a planned or unplanned action in the network 
	that results in a change in the Path that data traffic traverses.

    Discussion:
	Failover Events include, but are not limited to, link failure 
        and router failure.  Routing changes are considered Convergence 
        Events [7] and are not Failover Events.  This restricts 
        Failover Events to sub-IP layers.

        To switch data traffic from the Primary Path to the Backup Path 
        upon a Failover Event.

    Discussion:
        Failover to a Backup Path provides Link Protection, Node Protection,
        or Path Protection.  Failover is complete when Lost Packets, 
        Out-of-Order Packets, and Duplicate Packets are no longer observed.

        Failover Event.

    Discussion:
        Failure Recovery MUST occur when the Backup Path is the 
        Working Path.  The Backup Path is maintained as the 
        Working Path during Failure Recovery.

  3.4.3 Failover Node  
    Definition:
        A node along the Primary Path that is capable of Failover. 

    Discussion:
        The Failover Node can be any node along the Primary Path
        except the egress node of the Primary Path.  There can be 
        multiple Failover Nodes along a Primary Path.  The Failover 
        Node MUST be the ingress to the Backup Path.  The Failover 
        Node MAY also be the ingress of the Primary Path.

  3.4.4 Merge Node  
    Definition:
        A node along the Primary Path that is also the egress node
        of the Backup Path.

    Discussion:
        The Merge Node can be any node along the Primary Path
        except the ingress node of the Primary Path.  There can be 
        multiple Merge Nodes along a Primary Path.  A Merge Node 
        can be the egress node for a single or multiple Backup 
        Paths.  The Merge Node MUST be the egress to the Backup 
        Path.  The Merge Node MAY also be the egress of the 
        Primary Path.

  3.5 Metrics
  3.5.1 Failover Packet Loss  

    Definition:
	The amount of packet loss produced by a Failover Event
	until Failover completes.

    Discussion:
	Packet loss can be observed as a reduction of forwarded traffic 
        from  the maximum forwarding rate.  Failover Packet Loss includes 
        packets that were lost and packets that were delayed due to 
        buffering.  Failover Packet Loss MAY reach 100% of the offered 
        load.

    Measurement units:
        Number of Packets

  3.5.2 Reversion Packet Loss  

    Definition:
	The amount of packet loss produced by Reversion.

    Discussion:
	Packet loss can be observed as a reduction of forwarded traffic 
        from  the maximum forwarding rate.  Reversion Packet Loss includes 
        packets that were lost and packets that were delayed due to 
        buffering.  Reversion Packet Loss MAY reach 100% of the offered 
        load.

  3.6 Benchmarks
  3.6.1 Failover Time  

    Definition:
	The amount of time it takes for Failover to complete so that 
        the Backup Path is the Working Path.  

    Discussion:
        Failover Time can be calculated from Failover Packet Loss 
        that occurs due to a Failover Event and Failover as shown
        below in Equation 1:  

	(eq 1) Failover Time =
		Failover Packets Loss / Offered Load
		NOTE: Units for this measurement are 
		packets / packets/second = seconds

        Failover Time includes failure detection time and time for
        data traffic to begin traversing the Backup Path.

    Measurement units:
        Seconds

  3.6.2 Additive Backup Latency 
    Definition:
        The amount of increased latency resulting from data traffic 
        traversing the Backup Path instead of the Primary Path. 

    Discussion:
        Additive Backup Latency is calculated using Equation 2 as 
        shown below:

        (eq 2) Additive Backup Latency =
               Backup Path Latency - Primary Path Latency.

    Measurement units:
        Seconds

    Issues:
        Additive Backup Latency MAY be a negative result.  This is
        theoretically possible, but could be indicative of a 
        sub-optimum network configuration .

  3.6.3 Reversion Time 
    Definition:
	The amount of time it takes for Reversion to complete so 
        that the Primary Path is restored as the Working Path.  

    Discussion:
        Reversion Time can be calculated from Reversion Packet 
        Loss that occurs due to a Failure Recovery as shown
        below in Equation 3:  

	(eq 3) Reversion Time =
		Reversion Packets Loss / Offered Load
		NOTE: Units for this measurement are 
		packets / packets/second = seconds

        Reversion Time starts upon completion of Failure Recovery
        and includes the time for data traffic to begin traversing 
        the Primary Path.
