                    Private Discovery with TLS-ESNI
                   draft-huitema-dnssd-tls-privacy-01

Abstract

   DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about
   both the devices offering services and the devices requesting
   services.  This information includes host names, network parameters,
   and possibly a further description of the corresponding service
   instance.  Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS Service
   Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public hotspot, a serious privacy
   problem arises.

   We propose to solve this problem by developing a private discovery
   profile for UDP based transports using TLS, such as DTLS and QUIC.
   The profile is based on using the Encrypted SNI extension.  We also
   define a standalone private discovery service, that can be combined
   with arbitrary applications in the same way as DNS-SD.

1.  Introduction

   DNS-SD [RFC6763] over mDNS [RFC6762] enables configurationless
   service discovery in local networks.  It is very convenient for
   users, but it requires the public exposure of the offering and
   requesting identities along with information about the offered and
   requested services.  Parts of the published information can seriously
   breach the user's privacy.  These privacy issues and potential
   solutions are discussed in [KW14a] and [KW14b].

   When analyzing these scenarios in [I-D.ietf-dnssd-prireq], we find
   that the DNS-SD messages leak identifying information such as the
   instance name, the host name or service properties.

Internet-Draft      TLS/ESNI Based Private Discovery          March 2019


   In this document, we propose a discovery solution that can replace
   DNS-SD in simple deployment scenarios, with the following
   characteristics:

   1.  We only target discovery of peers on the same local network,
       using multicast.  We make no attempt at compatibility with the
       server based solutions such as DNSSD over Unicast DNS [RFC6763].

   2.  We do not attempt to keep the same formats as mDNS [RFC6762].

   3.  We assume a solution that can be integrated in an application,
       without dependency on system support.

   The proposed solution aligns with TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], and specifically
   with transports of TLS over UDP, such as DTLS [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13]
   or QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].  The solution uses SNI encryption
   [I-D.ietf-tls-esni].

   The solution assumes that entities who want to be privately
   discovered maintain an asymmetric discovery key pair.  The public
   component of that discovery key pair and the service name of the
   entity are provisioned to authorized discovery clients.  In this
   document, we will refer to this public component as the "Discovery
   Key" of the server.  When needed, we will refer to the private
   component of the key pair as the "Discovery Private Key".

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Discovery Service Using TLS and ESNI

   In the proposed solution, the first packet of a TLS-based UDP
   transport is broadcast or multicast over the local network.  This
   packet carries the TLS 1.3 ClientHello message, including an
   Encrypted SNI (ESNI) extension.  The ESNI is encrypted with the
   Discovery Key of the requested service.

   Services that are ready to be discovered listen on the broadcast or
   multicast address and check whether the received packets contain a
   TLS 1.3 ClientHello Message and an ESNI extension.  If the extension
   can be decrypted with the Private Discovery Key of the local service,
   they set up a connection.

   This mechanism only works with TLS based protocols operating over
   UDP, such as DTLS or QUIC.

Internet-Draft      TLS/ESNI Based Private Discovery          March 2019


2.1.  Discovery Key

   Private discovery relies on the privacy of the server Discovery Key,
   which is used to encrypt the target server name carried in the ESNI
   extension.  Clients can only discover a server if they know the
   server's Discovery Key.  Servers receiving a properly encrypted
   discovery request do not know the identity of the client issuing the
   request, but they know that the client belongs to a group authorized
   to perform the discovery.

   In the ESNI based specification, the server's Discovery Key plays the
   same role as the ESNI Encryption Key of the client facing server, but
   a major difference is that the Discovery Key is kept private.
   According to standard ESNI, the client facing server publishes an
   ESNI encryption key in the DNS.  In contrast, the Discovery Key MUST
   NOT be publicly available in the DNS.

   The discovery key is passed to the peer in exactly the same format as
   ESNI:

       struct {
           uint8 checksum[4];
           KeyShareEntry keys<4..2^16-1>;
           CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
           uint16 padded_length;
           uint64 not_before;
           uint64 not_after;
           Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
       } ESNIKeys;

   This document does not discuss how the Discovery Key is provisioned
   to authorized discovery clients.

   The ESNI extension design assumes that several services are available
   through a single client facing server.  These different services have
   different SNI values and length.  ESNI pads these SNI to a padded
   length specified for the client facing server, ensuring that third
   parties cannot infer the identity of the service from the length of
   the extension.  In our design, requests for multiple services are
   sent over multicast.  If different services used different padding
   length, third parties could infer the service identity from the ESNI
   length.  To prevent this information leakage, services participating
   in private discovery MUST set the padded length to exactly 128 bytes.

2.2.  ESNI Extension for Discovery

   The ESNI extension is defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] as:

         struct {
             CipherSuite suite;
             KeyShareEntry key_share;
             opaque record_digest<0..2^16-1>;
             opaque encrypted_sni<0..2^16-1>;
         } ClientEncryptedSNI;

   In standard ESNI usage, the "record_digest" identifies the ESNI
   Encryption Key.  Clients using private discovery MUST leave the
   "record_digest" empty, and encode it as a zero-length binary string.
   The ESNI Encryption Key will be the Discovery Key of the target
   server.

   The KeyShareEntry is set in accordance with the ESNI specification.
   It is combined with the server Discovery Key to encrypt the SNI.
   According to the ESNI specification, the encrypted structure
   contains:

         struct {
             ServerNameList sni;
             opaque zeros[ESNIKeys.padded_length - length(sni)];
         } PaddedServerNameList;

         struct {
             uint8 nonce[16];
             PaddedServerNameList realSNI;
         } ClientESNIInner;

   Servers that receive the extension as part of private discovery
   attempt to decrypt the value using their Private Discovery Key. If
   the decryption succeeds, and if the decrypted SNI corresponds to the
   expected value, the server will accept the discovery request.

2.3.  Integration with DTLS

   The message flows of DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] all start with
   the client sending a TLS ClientHello message.  The following figure
   presents a simple DTLS flow using the ESNI extension for private
   discovery:

    [Application Data]     <------->   [Application Data]

   The first flight consists of a single UDP packet.  In classic DTLS,
   this would be sent to the IP address and UDP port chosen for the
   application.  Instead, the client using private discovery MUST sent
   this to the "private discovery" multicast address defined in
   Section 6 and to the UDP port chosen for the application.

   The multicast message sent by the client will be received by many
   servers.  The servers using private discovery MUST verify that the
   ESNI extension is present.  If it is present, each server attempts to
   decrypt the ESNI extension using the local private discovery key, as
   specified in Section 2.2.  If the verification succeeds, the server
   proceeds with the connection, and sends the second flight of DTLS
   packets to the IP address and UDP port from which it received the
   client's first flight.

   The client receiving the second flight of messages processes them as
   specified in DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].  The client MUST verify
   that the ESNI extension is present, and matches the expected value as
   specified in Section 2.2.  If the ESNI extension is absent or does
   not pass verification, the entire flight MUST be ignored.  If the
   verification succeeds, the client remembers the IP address and UDP
   port of the server, and uses it for the reminder of the session.

   A successful ESNI exchange demonstrates to the server that the client
   has knowledge of the server discovery key, and to the client that the
   server is in possession of the corresponding private discovery key.
   This is meant to restrict access to a subset of the client and server
   population, but does not replace the need for server authentication
   and optional client authentication as specified in TLS 1.3.

2.4.  Integration with QUIC

   The QUIC Transport uses TLS to negotiate encryption keys.  The use of
   TLS in QUIC is specified in [I-D.ietf-quic-tls], and can be
   summarized as follow:

   1.  The QUIC connection starts with the client sending an Initial
       message, carrying a TLS ClientHello and its extensions.

   2.  The server replies with its own Initial message, carrying the
       server hello and establishing the "handshake" keys used to
       protect the reminder of the TLS 1.3 exchange.

   3.  Server and client exchange encrypted Handshake messages to verify
       that the session is properly established and to negotiate the
       encryption keys of the application data.

   4.  Server and Client exchange encrypted application messages until
       they decide to close the connection.

   All messages are sent over UDP.

   When using Private Discovery, the client adds an ESNI extension to
   the ClientHello sent in the Initial message.  The ESNI extension is
   formatted a specified in Section 2.2.  In classic QUIC, the Initial
   message would be sent in a UDP packet to the IP address and UDP port
   of the server.  Instead, the client using private discovery MUST sent
   this to the "private discovery" multicast address defined in
   Section 6 and to the UDP port chosen for the application.

   The multicast message sent by the client will be received by many
   servers.  The servers using private discovery MUST verify that the
   ESNI extension is present.  If it is present, each server attempts to
   decrypt the ESNI extension using the local private discovery key, as
   specified in Section 2.2.  If the verification succeeds, the server
   proceeds with the connection, and sends the next QUIC packets to the
   IP address and UDP port from which it received the client's first
   flight.

   The client receiving the second flight of messages processes them as
   specified in DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].  The client MUST verify

Internet-Draft      TLS/ESNI Based Private Discovery          March 2019


   that the ESNI extension is present, and matches the expected value as
   specified in Section 2.2.  If the ESNI extension is absent or does
   not pass verification, the entire QUIC connection MUST be ignored.
   If the verification succeeds, the client remembers the IP address and
   UDP port of the server, and uses it for the reminder of the QUIC
   connection.

3.  Private Discovery DNS Service

   The mechanisms discussed in Section 2 assume that an application
   based on DTLS or QUIC is modified to enable private local discovery.
   This does not cover all services.  Further services can be supported
   by a two-phase process in which each application is paired with an
   implementation of the private discovery service.

   The private discovery service is an implementation of DNS over QUIC,
   as specified in [I-D.huitema-quic-dnsoquic], modified to also
   implement the Private Discovery over Quic defined in Section 2.4.
   The DNS implementation is solely for the purpose of providing a
   service equivalent to DNS-SD.

   The Private Discovery DNS Service is run by the service that wants to
   be discovered.  The name of the discovery service is the name of the
   service that needs to be discovered.  Clients are provisioned with
   the associated Discovery Key. Clients discover the Private Discovery
   DNS Service, and can then use it to obtain the DNS records associated
   with the application service: SRV, TXT, A or AAAA records.

4.  Optional Server Arrival Announce

   The proposed design relies on active discovery of servers by the
   clients.  When a client arrives on a new network and wishes to
   establish a connection to a server, it sends a multicast message that
   tries to reach that server.  This designs has two potential issues:

      If the server is not present when a client tries to contact it,
      the client may have to repeat the connection attempts over time.

      If multiple clients connect to the same server, each client sends
      a multicast message, which can translate in heavy multicast load
      in some configurations.

   The importance of these two issues is debatable.  Many applications
   have a peer-to-peer nature, in which peers can be either clients or
   servers.  When two peers are not present at the same time, the first
   peer to arrive will fail to establish a connection, but the second
   peer will succeed, without having to rely on time based repetitions.
   Similarly, if we move from device oriented discovery to application



Huitema & Kaiser       Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      TLS/ESNI Based Private Discovery          March 2019


   oriented discovery, the number of client per server is likely to be
   very small, so that there will be little difference between
   "multicast per client" and "multicast per server".

   However, there may be configurations where a "server arrival
   announce" message would result in fast discovery and fewer multicast
   messages.

4.1.  Server Arrival Announce Specification

   The server arrival announce message is a UDP packet sent to the
   Discovery Multicast Address reserved in Section 6 and port %lt;TBD>.

   The format of the message will be defined in a next draft version,
   meeting the following requirements:

      Multiplexing: should be easily demuxed from DTLS or QUIC traffic.

      ESNI: should contain an ESNI extension, secured with the server's
      discovery key.

      Replay: should contain a timestamp and the global scope IPv6
      address of the server.

5.  Security Considerations

   The use of TLS 1.3 and the ESNI extension provides robust defenses
   against attacks.  In particular, Private Discovery benefits from the
   defenses against dictionary attacks and replay attacks built in the
   ESNI design.  Protections against a residual DOS attack is discussed
   in Section 5.1.

   The privacy of the discovery relies on keeping the discovery key of
   the service secret.  The consequences and partial mitigation of
   leaking the discovery key are discussed in Section 5.2.

   Compromising of the server's private discovery key will allow an
   attacker to break the privacy of the discovery, as discussed in
   Section 5.3.

5.1.  Denial of Service by Spoofed Response

   Attackers may try to disrupt a private discovery handshake by sending
   a spoofed Server Hello (DTLS) or a spoofed Server Initial packet
   (QUIC).  The client will reject these attempts after noticing that
   the encrypted extensions do not include a proper ESNI extension,
   containing the expected copy of the ESNI nonce.

Internet-Draft      TLS/ESNI Based Private Discovery          March 2019


   Attackers will not succeed spoofing the server, but they could
   succeed in denying the connection if the fake response arrives before
   the response from the actual server, and if the implementation just
   gave up the attempt after failing to validate the first response that
   it received.

   To defend against this attack, implementations SHOULD keep listening
   for responses and attempting validation until they receive at least
   one valid response from the expected server.

5.2.  Discovery Key Compromise

   The Discovery Key is known by all the authorized clients.  If one of
   these clients is compromised, the privacy of the server will be
   compromised: attackers will be able to spoof the authorized client
   and discover whether the server is present on a local network.
   However, the leak can only be exploited in an active attack: the
   attacker must actively set up a connection with the target server.

   The attack is mitigated when the server migrates to a different
   discovery key and restricts the availability of that key to non-
   compromised clients.

   Exploiting a compromised discovery key normally requires that the
   attacker is present on the same link as the target.  Attackers might
   try to work around that limitation by sending unicast packet targeted
   at plausible server locations.  Servers participating in private
   discovery MUST NOT accept discovery requests arriving from off-link
   sources.

5.3.  Private Discovery Key Compromise

   The private component of the asymmetric key pair used for discovery
   MUST be kept secret by the server.  If it is compromised, attackers
   can process discovery requests and verify that they can be decrypted
   with the server's private discovery key.  They could also process
   logs of old discovery attempts.

   The design provides two mitigations against the consequences of this
   failure:

   o  The discovery requests do not uniquely identify the client, and
      the attacker will only know that an attempt came from one of the
      authorized clients.

   o  The actual communications are protected by TLS, and inherit the
      forward secrecy properties of TLS 1.3.

   [[TODO: consider specifying a way to rotate the discovery key, so as
   to mitigate the lack of forward secrecy.  Maybe add that to ESNI. ]]

5.4.  Tracking by Replay

   Suppose that an attacker has identified a client, and is capable of
   recording the multicast messages from that client.  The attacker can
   then replay the message, triggering a response from the target server
   if present on the network.

   The attacker will not be able to actually establish a connection with
   the server -- the TSL and ESNI designs protect against that.  But it
   will be able to find out that the same server that responded to the
   client before responds now, which is a way to track the server.

   The attacker can mount two variations of the attack: replay over
   time, and replay at different locations.  In the current design, the
   main protection against that attack is the implementation of a
   "discovery window", so that servers only listen to multicast requests
   when they are "ready to be discovered".

   [[TODO: consider adding a time stamp in an extension to ESNI.]]

   [[TODO: consider adding the IPv6 address of the sender in an
   extension to ESNI.]]

   [[TODO: special consideration for server arrival announce.]]

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is required to allocate the IPv6 multicast address FF02::<TBD>
   for use as "Private Discovery Multicast Address" described in this
   document.

6.1.  Experimental use

   **RFC Editor's Note:** Please remove this section prior to
   publication of a final version of this document.

   Early experiments MAY use the address FF02::60DB:F6C5.  This address
   is marked in the IANA registry as unassigned.
