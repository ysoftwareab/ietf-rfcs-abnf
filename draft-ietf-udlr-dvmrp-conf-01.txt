Abstract


   This memo describes the configuration of the dynamic multicast
   routing protocol DVMRPv3 over a unidirectional link (UDL) such as a
   satellite network. Routers connected to the UDL implement a link-
   layer tunneling mechanism, as defined in the RFC 3077 [UDLR], in
   order to exchange routing information.

1. Introduction

   Multicast routing on a UDL such as a satellite network seems very
   complex because the receiver can not send its routing information to
   the feed.

   The RFC 3077, which describes a link-layer mechanism to emulate the
   full bidirectionality of all nodes connected by a unidirectional
   link, allows to connect natively receivers and feeds, emulating the
   behaviour of a LAN.  Feeds and receivers can therefore easily
   exchange their routing information.

   This document describes routing over UDLs in four different network
   architectures connecting feeds to receivers and explains how DVMRP
   should be configured for each case, considering the characteristics
   of the UDL and of the return link.

2. Network architectures

   Feed and receivers are connected via a UDL which is a satellite link.
   A geostationnary satellite link features a UDL between the feed and
   the receivers, a minimum throughput of 2048Kbps up to 48000Kbps and
   250ms delay from the feed to the receivers.

   A satellite link is extremely well suited for multicast IP. The large
   coverage associated to multicast allows to connect the feed to a huge
   number of receivers using a modest amount of bandwidth.

   The feed is directly connected to DVB/MPEG II [ETSI EN 300 421]
   transmission equipments.  Receivers integrate a DVB-S/MPEG satellite
   reception card (receive- only interface) with a MAC address of 48
   bits, similar to an Ethernet card.  This reception card supports
   unicast, broadcast and multicast mode.

   The feed and receivers implement the RFC 3077, hence making the UDL
   totally transparent for the IP layer.

2.1. Connectivity via the access router of the LAN

   In this architecture, the receiver has one receive-only interface and
   one Ethernet interface.

   The receiver uses the Ethernet interface to connect to the LAN on
   which workstations and one access router are connected.  GRE traffic
   is sent to the Feed Bidirectional IP (FBIP) via the access router of
   the LAN.  The access router doesn't require any multicast routing
   abilities.

2.2 Connectivity via PPP

   In this architecture, the receiver has one only-receive interface,
   one Ethernet interface and one PPP interface.
   The receiver uses the Ethernet interface to connect to the LAN on
   which workstations are connected.
   The receiver routes IP traffic encapsulated within GRE packets to
   FBIP through the PPP interface.

2.3 Connectivity on the same LAN with passive DVMRP mode

   In this architecture, the feed has its Ethernet interface connected
   on the same LAN as the receiver Recv1.

   Recv1 has one receive-only interface and one Ethernet interface.
   The objective of Recv1 is to send routing information to the feed to
   prevent the feed from considering that the satellite network is a
   leaf.
   This way, the feed sends its routing information because it has one
   permanent neighbor.

   Recv2 is a router that can switch between the active and the passive
   mode (as described in section 3.3) which solves scalability issues,
   i.e. it allows a huge number of receivers to listen to the multicast
   sessions.

2.4 MBone connectivity via 2 access points : the UDL and the LAN

   A feed is connected to the MBone/Internet and can forward
   multicast traffic over the UDL.
   IGMP and DVMRP messages come from receivers through the GRE
   tunnels.

   Receivers are connected to the UDL and also to a LAN which
   already has MBone connectivity.
   Receivers send routing information through the GRE tunnels to the
   feed.

   A client located on a remote LAN can receive multicast traffic
   either from the UDL (e.g. a satellite link) or from the
   "terrestrial" network.

   Figure 4 : MBone connectivity via 2 access points

   In the architecture described in the figure 4 :

   The Feed and Recv1 are neigbor DVMRP routers

   R1 (respectively R2) is a multicast router connected to the MBone
   that communicates with the Feed

   A and B are 2 multicast sources which transmit on the same multicast
   group. C located on LAN2 joins this group.

   From A, the multicast traffic is routed over the MBone cloud and
   through R2 to reach the client.

   In both cases, the shortest path is chosen to route the traffic
   between the source and the destinaton. Routing operates here in an
   optimal way.

   When C starts generating multicast traffic :

   1) to B : this traffic is routed through R2 and through the MBone.

   2) to A : this traffic would normally be routed through Recv1 and
   the feed because DVMRP thinks that C is only 2 hopes away from A.
   In fact, the multicast traffic would go from C to Recv1, then
   encapsulated within GRE packets, would go through the Internet up
   to the Feed and then forwarded over LAN1.

Internet Draft      Configuration of DVMRP over a UDL      November 2001


   This is not the optimal way to route traffic from LAN2 to LAN1
   because the multicast traffic would be forwarded in a GRE tunnel
   between Recv1 and the Feed over the Internet, whereas it could be
   natively and optimally routed in multicast between R2 and R1 over
   the MBone.
   Furthermore, the GRE encapsulation adds extra overhead useless here.

   To route the multicast traffic from LAN2 to LAN1 over the MBone and
   not within the GRE tunnel, DVMRP has to be configured on the
   receiver.
   The solution is to set an infinite metric to the bidirectional
   interface of the receiver.
   As a result, the receiver cannot compute the shortest path to a
   source via its bidirectional interface and then, cannot forward
   the traffic over the UDL.
   Furthermore, a receiver cannot announce valid routes to the feed
   since they would all have infinite metrics.
   The feed cannot compute any reverse path back through these
   receivers.
   Hence, it is not possible for the multicast traffic to come from
   the UDL but it flows from the terrestrial network to LAN1.

3. DVMRP over a UDL

3.1 Feeds and receivers

   DVMRPv3 is running on the feed and on receivers.

   While the feed and the receivers are considered to be on the
   same LAN, the Designated Querier and Forwarder on the UDL are
   elected as defined in respectively IGMPv2 [IGMPv2] and DVMRPv3
   [Pusa00].

Internet Draft      Configuration of DVMRP over a UDL      November 2001


3.1.1 Requirements

   - The feed is elected as the Designated Querier.
   The feed is the closest element from all receivers in term of
   transmission duration.
   To ensure that all queries are well centralized on the feed, it must
   be elected as the Designated Querier.

   - The feed has to be elected as the Designated Forwarder.
   The feed forwards data over the UDL.
   A receiver must not be elected as a Designated Forwarder to avoid
   that data are encapsulated into the link-layer tunneling mechanism
   up to the feed and then reforwarded over the UDL.

   - All active receivers are considered as DVMRP neighbors.

3.1.2 Consequences

   - The feed has the smallest IP address on the UDL.
   (Querier election mechanism as described in IGMPv2)

   - In the architecture described in section 2.3, i.e. the feed is the
    cheapest route between the LAN and the UDL.
   (Designated forwarder election mechanism as described in DVMRPv3
    section 2.4)

   - All active receivers have a return link channel up.
   A receiver configured in passive mode routing without a return link
   channel won't be able to contribute to any multicast sessions and
   won't route multicast traffic coming from the UDL to its LAN.

3.2 Broadcast and prune mode

   DVMRP is based on "broadcast and prune" mode, ie the DVMRP router
   initially floods datagrams out of all dependent downstream
   interfaces and then stops flooding when it has received prune
   messages from all downstream routers.

   On a UDL, it is primordial to ensure that the upstream router
   receives all prune messages from its downstream routers.
   If a prune message is lost, useless traffic continues to be
   forwarded and hence wastes bandwidth.

   The network architectures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 show
   that the links connecting receivers to feeds are very different
   than links connecting a LAN.
   Indeed, these links cross many routers in the Internet, which
   increases dramatically the loss rate and therefore the probability



Guinamand, Charron                                              [Page 8]

Internet Draft      Configuration of DVMRP over a UDL      November 2001


   to loose a prune message.

   For this reason, prunes must be retransmitted using binary
   exponential back-off during the lifetime of the prune if traffic is
   still arriving on the upstream interface.
   The algorithm is described in [Pusa00], section 3.5.5

   Example:
   Add "rexmit_prunes on" for the UDL interface of each receiver in the
    mrouted configuration file (implementation of DVMRPv3)

3.3 DVMRP scalability issues and passive mode

   DVMRP routers multicast Probe messages to establish 2 way neighbor
   adjacency.
   The fact that all receivers are DVMRP neighbors on the UDL increases
   dramatically the DVMRP traffic and the size of routing tables with
   the exchange of DVMRP Reports.

   Example:
      The mrouted implementation of DVMRPv3 supports only 64 neighbors.

   A solution is to configure the DVMRP routers in passive mode.
   The general idea of the passive mode is to allow a receiver to
   forward multicast traffic from the UDL over the LAN without
   establishing a 2 way relationship with a feed.

   There are several reasons for that :

   - A UDL such as a satellite network is a flat architecture in which
   the feed may have more than 64 neighbors.
   The passive mode allows more than 64 receivers.

   - The Probe messages sent periodically by DVMRP routers keep the PPP
   connection alive until there is no more a member of a multicast
   session behind a receiver.
   Receivers will route multicast datagrams from the UDL to the LAN on
   which they are connected without sending any information to the
   upstream router.
   The passive mode hence saves the cost of a return channel :
   end-users on LANs behind a receiver are able to receive the
   multicast datagrams without using a return channel.
   Only contributions to multicast sessions require switching to active
   routing mode.

   A DVMRP router sends routing information or route reports which are
   used for determining the reverse path neighbor back to the source of
   the multicast traffic.



Guinamand, Charron                                              [Page 9]

Internet Draft      Configuration of DVMRP over a UDL      November 2001


   The feed will send these information only if at least one receiver
   is configured in active DVMRP mode.

   Indeed, an application that sends join messages for specific
   multicast groups over the UDL without any active receiver manages to
    send multicast datagrams to the UDL.

   But it is not enough because receivers will not forward these
   datagrams as they don't receive the routing information or route
   reports of the upstream router.

4. Domains of application
   The purpose of this section is to describe two kinds of application
   wherein dynamic multicast routing over a UDL presents a lot of
   benefits.

4.1 Reliable multicast

   [UDLR] is very well suited for applications based on reliable
   multicast in push mode.

   A multicast push server is connected to the feed.
   A set of multicast push clients on the remote sites are connected
   to the UDL.

   Multicast datagrams from the push server are routed over the UDL as
   soon as one client joins the multicast group.
   In case of packet losses, push clients send back NACKs to the push
   server to ask for retransmission.
   These requests are sent in multicast and relayed by the receiver
   through the link-layer tunneling mechanism up to the feed.

   This provides a mechanism for push client to refrain from asking
   retransmission of packet which were already requested by another
   client.

   A such mechanism is very well suited when a large number of clients
   detect the same packets loss.
   It avoids an implosion of request messages at the server.

4.2 Teleteaching

   For this application, receivers are configured in passive mode.
   They receive teleteaching multicast sessions on their receive-only
   interface and route them through their Ethernet interface on the
   corporate LAN.
   Every host connected on the LAN receives the multicast session.
   Switching to active mode is obviously required if a member wishes to

   contribute to the session.

   A multicast IP address can be defined in the DVMRP router's
   configuration to allow to switch between active and passive mode.
   Indeed, if a host on the corporate LAN joins this multicast IP
   address, the DVMRP router automatically switches to active mode.
   It switches back to passive mode as soon as no more member of this
   multicast group is present.
