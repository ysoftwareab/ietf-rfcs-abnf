Abstract

   This document deprecates RC4 in Secure Shell (SSH).  Therefore, this
   document updates RFC 4253, and moves to Historic RFC 4345.

1. Introduction

   The usage of RC4 suites ( also designated as arcfour ) for SSH are
   specified in [RFC 4253] and [RFC 4345]. [RFC 4253] specifies the
   allocation of the "arcfour" cipher for SSH. RFC 4345 specifies and
   allocates the the "arcfour-128" and "arcfour-256" ciphers for SSH.

   RC4 encryption is steadily weakening in cryptographic strength [RFC7457]
   [draft-ietf-curdle-des-des-des-die-die-die-05] and the deprecation process
   should be begun for their use in SSH.


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119, RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2. Why obsolete and move to Historic RFC 4345

   RFC 4345 defines the "arcfour-128" and "arcfour-256" modes for SSH,
   and is obsoleted and moved to Historic as RC4 is broken [RFC7457].
   The modes defined by RFC 4345 MUST NOT be used.

3. Updates to RFC 4253

   RFC 4253 is updated to prohibit arcfour's use in SSH.

   The last sentence of the paragraph on RC4 (called "arcfour"
   in [RFC4253]) in Section 6.3 of [RFC4253] should read: "Arcfour (also
   known as RC4) is broken [RFC7457] and therefore it MUST NOT be used."

   An informative reference to RFC 7457 is to be added to [RFC4253].

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA may need to take action as the status for RC4 and 3DES
   algorithms for Secure Shell (SSH) is changed by this document
   (see Section 3, that updates [RFC4253]).

5. Security Considerations

   This document only prohibits the use of RC4 in SSH, and introduces no
   new security considerations.

6. Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the numerous authors which have shown the weaknesses of
   RC4 throughout the years, and to the several people which have
   commented on the CURDLE mailing list about this document.
