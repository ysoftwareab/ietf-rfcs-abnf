4.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable

Internet-Draft      Performance Measurement Caps MIB            May 2000


   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

5.  Overview

There is a need for a standardized way of characterizing the performance
measurement capabilities of remote monitoring tools which provide
statistics based on these measurements.  There are many different
techniques for measuring and characterizing the performance of specific
network-based applications available at this time. A standardized
framework for describing the capabilities of a particular technique is
needed as a pre-requisite for a standardized Performance Measurement
results reporting framework.

This memo addresses the specific requirements of the Performance
Measurement capabilities framework.  Other aspects of this framework,
such as configuration and results reporting are not addressed in this
memo.

5.1.  Terms

Some new terms are used throughout this document:

5.1.1.  Performance Measurement (PM)

This term refers to any implementation-specific PM Data collection
mechanism, for the purpose of instrumenting the Application Performance
Measurement (APM) MIB [APM] and/or the Transport Performance Metrics
(TPM) MIB [TPM].

5.1.2.  PM Data

The actual measurements, kept in some internal representation, collected
from one or more PM Collection Points. This data is converted into one
or more APM and/or TPM Reports, in an implementation-specific manner.

5.1.3.  APM Device

A device which contains an SNMP agent which implements the APM MIB. For
the purpose of the standard, the APM device is the entity that is
reporting the APM results, in the form of standard MIB objects.  An APM
Device can obtain PM data from one or more PM Collection Points.

Internet-Draft      Performance Measurement Caps MIB            May 2000


5.1.4.  TPM Device

A device which contains an SNMP agent which implements the TPM MIB. For
the purpose of the standard, the TPM device is the entity that is
reporting the TPM results, in the form of standard MIB objects.  A TPM
Device can obtain PM data from one or more PM Collection Points.

5.1.5.  PM Collection Point

The general location, within the spectrum of possible vantage points,
that PM Data is collected, for one or more APM or TPM Studies (and
perhaps more than one APM or TPM device).  The interaction between an
APM or TPM device and a PM Collection Point is outside the scope of this
standard.

5.1.6.  PM Study Class

The unique set of mechanisms and parameters that classifies and
identifies a particular APM or TPM collection capability.  E.g.,

 - the set of protocols collected

 - test attributes (standard and proprietary)

 - collection technique(s)

 - PM Collection Point information

 - report capabilities

 - vendor-specific Study Class ID

5.1.7.  PM Study

This is an instantiation of a particular PM Study Class, for the purpose
of generating APM and/or TPM reports.  Some parameters, such as:

 - the dataSource to monitor

 - any resource restrictions to enforce

 - the specific set of result data to collect

are relevant only in the context of an PM Study, not a PM Study Class.

Internet-Draft      Performance Measurement Caps MIB            May 2000


5.1.8.  PM Report Class

The type of APM or TPM report produced on behalf of a particular PM
Study Class. E.g.,

 - distribution-based aggregation

 - statistica-based aggregation

 - exception-based reporting

5.1.9.  APM Report

The set of result data for a particular PM Study.  This is in the form
of standard MIB objects and notifications in the APM MIB [APM].

5.1.10.  TPM Report

The set of result data for a particular PM Study.  This is in the form
of standard MIB objects and notifications in the TPM MIB [TPM].

5.1.11.  PM Location

The notion of where a PM Collection Point is obtaining PM Data. At the
highest level, the possible locations are:

  - client

  - network

  - server

5.1.12.  PM Class

At the highest level, there are three classes of PM technology.

 - passive collection
     No test traffic is introduced into the system being measured.  PM
     Data is derived from observable 'user activity' in the actual
     operating environment.

 - active collection
     Some form of test traffic is introduced into the system being
     measured.  PM Data is derived from measured attributes of this test
     traffic.

Internet-Draft      Performance Measurement Caps MIB            May 2000


 - built-in collection
     Measurement mechanisms are somehow embedded in actual network
     traffic, for the purpose of PM Data collection.  PM Data is derived
     from measured attributes, via these built-in mechanisms.

5.2.  Relationship to RMON-2 MIB

This MIB uses the protocolDirTable [RFC2021] to identify the protocols
which are relevant to a particular PM Study Class. Implementation of the
protocolDirectoryGroup is required.

5.3.  Relationship to IPPM

This MIB uses the Metric definitions found in IPPM documents ([RFC2330]
[RFC2678] [RFC2679] [RFC2680] [RFC2681]) to define derived metrics for
use with the APM and TPM MIBs.

5.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

This MIB assumes that a standard Application Performance Measurement MIB
[APM] will be produced, which will provide support for basic
configuration and collection of APM Reports.

This MIB also assumes that a standard Transport Performance Measurement
MIB [TPM] will be produced, which will provide additional 'drill-down'
support for transport layer protocols and additional metrics not
directly supported by the APM MIB.

6.  PM Framework Components

A PM Study is executed and reported within the PM Framework.  Usually,
some sort of network infrastructure is assumed, in which client devices,
application servers, forwarding devices, and one or more PM monitoring
devices are connected.  However, non-networking based methodologies can
also be used.

Some basic attributes of the PM Framework are listed below.

6.1.  Performance Criteria

A set of network, transport, and/or application performance criteria is
needed, based on some combination of network traffic attributes.  The
specification and evaluation of performance test results is beyond the
scope of this document.

Internet-Draft      Performance Measurement Caps MIB            May 2000


6.2.  Performance Measurement Granularity

Each PM Study Class explicitly defines the granularity of the test, in
terms of the purpose, selected metrics, and other attributes.

6.3.  Network Traffic Selection Criteria

For PM techniques which monitor or generate network traffic, a set of
rules is needed which specifies which packets will be included for
measurement in a particular performance test.  This includes device
attributes such as interface identity, and packet attributes such as
VLAN ID, QoS value, IP subnet or host addresses, application type(s),
and application payload.

6.4.  Network Traffic Generation Configuration

Active PM techniques require that the traffic generation mechanism(s) be
properly configured prior to execution of any PM Studies.  These
configuration requirements are outside the scope of this document.

6.5.  Set of Metrics

For each PM Study Class, there are one or more metrics, appropriate for
the associated network traffic and performance selection criteria, which
are measured by the APM and/or TPM device(s) used for an individual PM
Study.

6.6.  PM Study Class Capabilities

For each PM Study Class supported by an APM or TPM Device, there is a
set of capabilities associated with the selected set of metrics and
performance criteria. There is also a set of possible report output
capabilities associated with each class.

Internet-Draft      Performance Measurement Caps MIB            May 2000


6.7.  PM Collection Point Location

The physical location of each PM Collection Point is an important
attribute of each PM Study Class.

   +------------+    +---------+             +----------+    +----------+
   |            |    | Last    |             | Last Hop |    |          |
   |  Client    |<-->| Hop for |<--> ... <-->| for Net  |<-->| Network  |
   |            |    | Client  |             | Service  |    | Service  |
   +------------+    +---------+             +----------+    +----------+

           <------------- Measurement Device Location ------------>

For the purposes of this MIB, a PM Collection Point resides in either
the 'client', the 'network', or the 'server'.

6.8.  PM Study Configuration

Each PM Study may require some combination of generic and test-specific
configuration commands in order to prepare the network environment for
measurement.  Specific PM Study configuration mechanisms are beyond the
scope of this document.

6.9.  PM Study Results Storage and Retrieval

Each APM or TPM Device must be able to store the APM or TPM Reports
generated on behalf of each PM Study, and convey these reports to a
management application.  The specification of these mechanisms are
beyond the scope of this document.

7.  PM Caps MIB Groups

The PM Caps MIB contains one MIB group.

7.1.  PM Capabilities

This group contains MIB objects used to report the capabilities of the
PM Study Classes supported by a particular APM or TPM Device.

          for the interval starting at the instant 'Src'
          initiates a transaction of Type-P with the 'Dst'
          host, and ending at the instant the last packet
          of the transaction has been received. In addition to
          successful connectivity over this interval, the

          for a transaction to be considered successful.
          If either condition is false, then that transaction
          is considered to be unsuccessful.

          The derived metric is defined as the total number
          of successful transactions between Src and Dst,
          divided by the total number of transaction attempts
          between Src and Dst, during the time interval dT.

          a requested service, by measuring the speed of
          individual application transactions.

          This metric is calculated by utilizing a variation of
          the IPPM metric 'Type-P-Round-trip-Delay'. The
          total transaction time (dT) is determined by summing
          all the packet transactions of Type-P between the
          Src and Dst hosts. The bi-directional flight times
          are measured (as specified by the IPPM metric definition),
          but the server response time for each request is included
          in the measurement.

          The derived metric is defined as the total number
          of tenths of seconds for the transaction between
          Src and Dst to complete.

        Metric Parameters:

          For transactions over one terabit in size, it
          is defined as the average number of seconds for the
          transaction between Src and Dst to complete, for
          each terabit of data.

          E.g., a transfer rate of 2Kbps equals 500,000,000 and
          a transfer rate of 1Gbps = 1000.

        Metric Parameters:
          Src, the network address of a host
          Dst, the network address of a host
          dT, a time interval
          B, a number of terabits

        Metric Units:
          Seconds Per Terabit

        Mapping of Type P:
          Type P refers to an application protocol
          encapsulation, identified by a specific
          protocolDirEntry, which is characterized
          as a throughput-oriented protocol.

11.  Security Considerations

There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter
or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP SET
operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View- based Access
Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
