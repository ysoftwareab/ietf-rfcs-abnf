                Interface to the Address Pool Management
        draft-sun-i2apm-address-pool-management-arch-01

Abstract

   This document describes an mechanism for a standard, programmatic
   interface for address pool management.  With the remaining IPv4
   address becoming more and more scattered, it is complicated to
   manually configure the address pools on lots of Broadband Network
   Gateways(BNGs) for operators.  By introducing SDN/NFV in BNG, the
   address pools can be allocated in a centralized way.  It will not
   only simplify the address management for operators, but also improve
   the utilization efficiency of the address pool.

1.  Introduction

   The Broadband Network Gateway(BNG), which manages a routable IP
   address on behalf of each subscriber, should be configured with the
   IP address pools allocated to subscribers.  However, currently
   operators are facing with the address shortage problem, the remaining
   IPv4 address pools are usually quite scattered, no more than /24 per
   address pool in many cases.  Therefore, it is complicated to manually
   configure the address pools on lots of Broadband Network Gateway(BNG)
   for operators.  For large scale MAN, the number of BNGs can be up to
   over one hundred.  Manual configuration on all the BNGs statically
   will not only greatly increase the workload, but also decrease the
   utilization efficiency of the address pools when the number of
   subscribers changes in the future.

   Another use case which needs to configure the address pools is IPv6
   migration.  For IPv6 transition mechanisms, e.g.  DS-Lite, lw4over6,
   etc., they all need to be configured with address pools as translated
   routeable addresses.  When high availability features, e.g. active-
   active/active-standby failover mechanism, etc., are enabled for these
   IPv6 transition mechanisms, different address pools need to be
   configured on each transition instance.  This will further increase

Internet-Draft           Address Pool Management               July 2016


   the number of address pools need to be configured.  Besides, the
   occupation of the address pools may vary during different transition
   periods, (e.g. at the early stage of IPv6 transition, IPv4 traffic
   will normally occupy a great portion of the total traffic, while in
   the later stage of IPv6 transition, IPv4 traffic will decrease and
   the amount of IPv4 address pools will decrease accordingly.

   There are other devices which may need to configure address pools as
   well.  For example, the Firewall need to configure the address pool
   for acl/NAT process.  The VPN also needs to configure the address
   pools for end-users.

   When SDN/NFV is introduced in the network, these devices (e.g.  BNG,
   CGN, firewall, VPN, etc.) will run as VNFs in virtualized
   environment.  A common centralized address management server can
   interact with different VNFs and allocate address pools
   automatically.

   In this document, we propose a mechanism to manage the address pools
   centrally.  In this way, operators do not need to configure the
   address pools one by one manually and it also helps to use the
   address pools more efficiently.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

      APMS A management system which has a centralized databse manage
      the overall address pools and allocate address pools to the device
      in the devices.

      DA A device agent in device, which contact with APM server to
      manipulate address pool.

3.  Architectural Overview

   In this architecture, the Address Pool Management (APM) server is a
   centralized address pool management server for operators to configure
   the overall address pools.  It maintains the address pool database
   including the overall address pools (OAP) and the address pool
   status(APS).  Operators can configure its remaining address pools in
   the OAP.  They can also reserve some address pool for special-purpose
   usage.  The address pools status is to reflects the current usage of
   the address pools for different devices.  APM also has the interface
   to configure the address pools to different devices dynamically.

   In each device, there is an device agent (DA) to contact with APM
   server.  It initiates the address pools allocation requests, passes

   the address pools to local instances, report the status of local
   address pool usage and update the address pools requests, etc.  For
   some devices, e.g. v6transition, VPN, etc., additional routing
   modules needs to update the routing table accordingly.

   The overall procedure is as follows:

   o  Operators will configure remaining address pools centrally in the
      Address Pool Management System (APMS).  There are multiple address
      pools which can be configured centrally.  The APMS server will
      then divide the address pools into addressing unit (AU) which will
      be allocated to the agent in devices by default.

   o  The agent will initiate Address Pool request to the APMS.  It can
      carry its desired size of address pool the request, or just use a
      default value.  The address pool size in the request is only used

      as a hint.  The actual size of the address pool is totally
      determined by APMS.  It will also carry the DA's identification
      and the type of address pool.

   o  APMS looks up the remaining address pool in its local database.
      It will then allocate a set of address pools to the DA.  Each
      address pool has a related lifetime.

   o  DA receives the AddressPool reply and use them for their purpose.

   o  If the lifetime of the address pool is going to expire, the DA
      should issue an AddressPoolRenew request to extend the
      lifetime,including the IPv4, IPv6, Ports, etc.

   o  The AddressPoolReport module keeps monitoring and reports the
      current usage of all current address pools for each transition
      mechanism. if it is running out of address pools, it can renew the
      AddressPoolRequest for a newly allocated one.  It can also release
      and recycle an existing address pool if the that address pool has
      not been used for a specific and configurable time.

   o  When the connection of APMS is lost or the APMS needs the status
      information of certain applications, the APMS may pre-actively
      query the DA for the status information.

               Figure 2: Initial Address Pool Configuration

   Figure 2 illustrates the initial address pool configuration
   procedure:

   1.  The DA checks whether there is already address pool configured in
       the local site when it starts up. if no, it means the initial
       start-up or the address pool has been released. if yes, the
       address pool could be used directly.

   2.  The DA will initiate Address Pool request to the APMS.  It can
       carry its desired size of address pool in the request, or just
       use a default value.  The address pool size in the DA's request
       is only used as a hint.  The actual size of the address pool is
       totally determined by APMS.  It will also carry the DA's
       identification, the type of transition mechanism and the
       indication of port allocation support.

   3.  The APMS determines the address pool allocated for the DA based
       on the parameters received.

   4.  The APMS sends the Address Pool Reply to the DA.  It will also
       distribute the routing entry of the address pool automatically.
       In particular, if the newly received address pool can be
       aggregated to an existing one, the routing should be aggregated
       accordingly.

                   Figure 3: Address Pool Status Report

   Figure 3 illustrates the active address pool status report procedure:

   1.  The DA will monitor and count the usage status of the local
       address pool.  The DA counts the address usage status in one
       month, one week and one day, which includes the local address,
       address usage ratio (peak and average values), and the port usage
       ratio (peak and average values).

   2.  The DA reports the address pool usage status to the APMS. for
       example, it will report the address usage status in one day,
       which contains the IP address, NAT44, address list:
       30.14.44.0/28, peak address value 14, average address usage ratio
       90%, TCP port usage ratio 20%, UDP port usage ratio 30% and etc.

   3.  The APMS records the status and compares with the existing
       address information to determine whether additional address pool
       is needed.

   4.  The APMS will confirm the address pool status report request to
       the DA.  It will keep sending the address pool status report
       request to the APMS if no confirm message is received.

6.  Address Pool Status Query

   When the status of APMS is lost or the AMS needs the status
   information of the DAs, the APMS may actively query the TD for the
   status information, as shown in step 1 of Figure 4.  The following
   steps 2,3,4,5 are the same as the Address Pool Status Report
   procedure.

7.  Address Exhaustion

   When the DA uses up the addresses allocated, it will renew the
   address pool request to the APMS for an additional address pool.  The
   procedure is the same as the initial address pool request.

                      Figure 5: Address Pool Release

   Figure 5 illustrates the address pool release procedure:

   1.  The counting module in the DA checks that there are addresses not
       used for a long time;

   2.  The DA sends the address pool release request to the APMS to ask
       the release of those addresses;

   3.  The APMS updates the local address pool information to add the
       new addressed released.

   4.  The APMS notifies the TD that the addresses have been release
       successfully;

   5.  The DA will update the local address pool. if no Address Pool
       Release Notification is received, the DA will repeat step 2;

   6.  The DA confirms with the APMS that the addres pool has been
       released successfully.

9.  Control Protocol consideration

   The I2APM architecture consists of two major distinct entities: APM
   Server and network equipment with an APM Agent.  In order to provide
   address pool manipulations between these two entities, the I2APM
   architecture calls for well-defined protocols for interfacing between
   them.  For compatibility with legacy network equipment, the
   architecture reuse legacy protocol such as radius.  While the IETF
   may also choose to define one or more specific approaches to
   manipulate address pool, such as NETCONF or RESTCONF with address
   pool YANG data model.
