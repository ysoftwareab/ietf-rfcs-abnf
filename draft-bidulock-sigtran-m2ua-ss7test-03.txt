    This Internet-Draft provides information for the Internet community
  on the implementation of test cases for testing the SS7 MTP2-User
  Adaptation Layer [M2UA] Signalling Gateway (SG) based on the
  conformance test specifications for SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.780], [Q.781],

1.  Introduction

    This draft provides details for implementation of testing of SS7
  MTP-User Adaptation Layer [M2UA] Signalling Gateways (SG) based on the
  test specifications for SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.780], [Q.781],
  [M2PATEST07].  The general aspects for SS7 protocol testing [Q.780],
  [M2PATEST07] describes the requirement for an MTP Level 3 Simulator in
  the test environment for SS7 MTP Level 2 testing [Q.781],
  [M2PATEST07].  This MTP Level 3 Simulator is responsible for issuing
  and accepting request and indication primitives as well as sending and
  receiving signalling messages [Q.780], [M2PATEST07].

    This memo describes how the MTP Level 3 Simulator would use SS7
  MTP2-User Adaptation Layer messages to test a Signalling Gateway
  implementation of [M2UA].

1.1.  Scope

    Although the SS7 MTP Level 2 test cases [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] are
  applicable in entirety to SS7 signalling links implemented at the M2UA
  Signalling Gateway, this memo details the mapping of M2UA messages to
  SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP) Signalling Link [Q.703], [M2PA]
  signals used in the SS7 MTP Level 2 tests [Q.781], [M2PATEST07].

1.3.  Terminology

  Compatibility Test (CPT)-- A test where multiple implementations are
      tested in interaction with each other to test for compatibility
      between implementations.

  Implementation Under Test (IUT)-- An implementation being tested (the
      object of testing) as part of a validation, compatibility or
      interoperability test within the test environment.

  Interoperability Test (IOT)-- A test where multiple implementations
      are tested in interaction with each other to test for
      interoperability between implementations.

  M2UA Monitor-- A device or function used to monitor, capture, record
      and analyze the exchange of M2UA messages across and IP network
      between implementations or protocol testers.  This device function
      may be integrated with a protocol tester.

  MTP Level 3 Simulator-- A device or function used to simulate the SS7
      MTP Level 3 [Q.704] to SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.703], [M2PA]
      implementation.  This device or function may be integrated within
      the Test Environment.  This device or function is normally
      required for SS7 MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PA]
      validation, compatibility or interoperability tests.

  Protocol Tester (PT)-- A device or function used to generate normal or
      abnormal messages and test sequences for the purpose of validation
      testing.

  Signalling Link-- A signalling link, SS7 [Q.703] or M2PA [M2PA], used
      to carry SS7 MTP Level 2 signalling between IUT and PT.

  Test Case-- A particular sequence of messages and patters that make up
      a single validation, compatibility or interoperability test.

  Test Environment-- The environment that contains the testing device
      and functiosn necessary and sufficient for executing a test suite.

  Test Suite-- A collection of test cases meant to acheive a specific
      objective of validation, compatibility or interoperability
      testing.

  Validation Test (VAT)-- A test where a single implementation is tested
      in interaction with a protocol tester to test for validation of

      the implementation to a technical specification.

1.4.  Conventions

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Test Environment

    The test environment for SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.781], [M2PATEST07]
  testing is described in the General Aspects of SS7 testing [Q.780],
  [M2PATEST07].  There are two types of testing that are accomodated as
  follows:

  Validation Testing -- consists of validating a single Implementation
      Under Test (IUT).  This is performed by connecting the IUT to a
      Protocol Tester (PT) within the test enviroment.

      Validation testing is more extensive that compatibility testing.
      This is because it is possible, with the use of the Protocol
      Tester (PT), to generate messages and patterns, that cannot
      normally be generated from an implementation, to test the response
      of the Implementation Under Test (IUT) to abnormal conditions.

  Compatibility Testing -- consists of testing the compatiability of one
      Implementation Under Test (IUT) with another.  This is performed
      by connecting the IUTs together within the test environment.

      Compatibility testing is less extensive than validation testing.
      This is because it is not normally possible to generate non-
      compliant test patterns with an implementation that conforms to
      validation testing.  However, compatibility tests are better at
      testing the interoperability of two implementations.

  Interoperability Testing -- consists of testing the interoperability
      of one Implementation Under Test (IUT) with another.  This is
      performed by connecting the IUT together within the test
      environment.

      Interoperability testing is more extensive than compatibility
      testing and less extensive than validation testing.  Where
      compatibility testing assumes that the IUT have passed validation
      testing, interoperability testing makes no such assumption.  In
      addition, the test environment is expected to have more control
      over the IUT in interoperability testing than in compatibility
      testing.  It may be possible to generate some message and command
      or response sequences that would not normally by possible with an
      IUT during compatibility testing.

      The objectives of interoperability testing are often different
      than compatibility testing.  The object of compatibility testing
      is to assure that an implementation that passes validation testing

B. Bidulock                    Version 0.3                        Page 4

Internet-Draft                M2UA-SS7TEST              February 3, 2007

      is, in other respects not tested by validation testing, compatible
      with other such implementations.  The object of interoperability
      testing is to show that there exist implementations with which
      each of the IUT being tested can indeed function.

      Although they have different objectives, the test environment
      configuration for interoperability testing is the same as that for
      compatibility testing.

2.1.  Test Configurations

    This section details the Validation and Compatibility test
  configurations used for testing M2UA SG and ASP for SS7 MTP Level 2
  conformance.

2.1.1.  Validation Test Configuration

    Validation testing consists of validating a single Implementation
  Under Test (IUT) for SS7 MTP Level 2 conformance.  Several test
  configurations can be used with M2UA Signalling Gateways (SG) and
  Application Server Processes (ASP) as follows:

2.1.1.1.  SS7 Validation Test Configuration

    Figure 1 illustrates the Validation Test configuration.  As
  described in the SS7 Test Specification [Q.780], [M2PATEST07], the SS7
  Level 2 validation testing environment consists of the following
  components:

    For this configuration, the interface between the Implementation
  Under Test (IUT) and the MTP Level 3 Simulator is that described in
  the SS7 Test Specification [Q.780], [M2PATEST07].  This is the normal
  configuration for SS7 MTP Level 2 testing [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] and is
  not modified by this memo.  Normal SS7 MTP Level 2 testing SHOULD be
  performed on the M2UA SG before performing validation, compatibility
  or interoperability tests in the other configurations described in
  this memo.

    Figure 2 illustrates the Validation Test configuration.  As
  described in the SS7 Test Specification [Q.780], [M2PATEST07], the SS7
  Level 2 validation testing environment consists of the following
  components:

   (1)   The Implementation Under Test (IUT) that is being validated at
         position "SP A".

   (2)   An MTP Level 3 Simulator attached to the IUT at position "SP
         A".

   (3)   The Protocol Tester (PT) performing validation tests at
         position "SP B".

   (4)   A Signalling Link [Q.703 or M2PA] between the PT at position
         "SP B" and the IUT at position "SP A".

   (5)   A Link Monitor monitoring the message exchange accross the
         Signalling Link [Q.703 or M2PA].  This function MAY be
         integrated with the Protocol Tester or the Test Environment.

    In addition, this memo specifies the interface between the
  Implementation Under Test (IUT) and the MTP Level 3 Simulator [Q.780],
  [M2PATEST07] within the test environment.

    The MTP Level 3 Simulator SHALL be attached to the IUT a position
  "SP A" using an M2UA SCTP Association.  The MTP Level 3 Simulator
  SHALL inject and collect M2UA messages to and from the IUT during the
  performance of SS7 MTP Level 2 testing [Q.781], [M2PATEST07].  The MTP
  Level 3 Simulator SHALL inject and collect the M2UA messages as
  decribed in Section 4 of this document.

2.1.1.3.  SG-ASP Validation Test Configuration

    Figure 3 illustrates a Validation Test Configuration that includes
  an ASP in the validation tests.  In this case the MTP Level 3
  Simulator is connected at the ASP rather than directly to the SG.  In
  this configuration, the combination of ASP and SG form the
  Implementation Under Test (IUT).

    For this configuration the interface between the MTP Level 3
  Simulator and the M2UA ASP is the same as for normal SS7 MTP Level 2
  Testing [Q.780], [Q.781], [M2PATEST07].  The test envirnoment SHOULD
  include monitoring of the M2UA SCTP Association to ensure the mapping
  between SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.703], [M2PA] signals, SS7 MTP Level 2 Test
  Specification [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] commands, and SS7 MTP2-User
  Adaptation Layer [M2UA] messages as described in Section 4.

2.1.2.  Compatibility Test Configurations

    Compatibility testing consists of testing two Implementations Under
  Test (IUT) for compatibility with each other.  Several test
  configurations can be used with M2UA Signalling Gateways (SG) and

    In addition, this memo specifies the interface between the

  [M2PATEST07] within the test environment.

    The MTP Level 3 Simulators SHALL be attached to the IUT at position
  "SP A" and the IUT at position "SP B" using an M2UA SCTP Association.
  The MTP Level 3 Simulator SHALL inject and collect M2UA messages to
  and from the IUT during the performance of SS7 MTP Level 2 testing
  [Q.781], [M2PATEST07].  The MTP Level 3 Simulator SHALL inject and
  collect the M2UA messages as decribed in Section 4 of this document.

2.1.2.3.  SG-ASP Compatibility Test Configuration

    Figure 6 illustrates a Compatibility Test Configuration that
  includes an ASP in the compatibility tests.  In this case the MTP
  Level 3 Simulator is connected at the ASP rather than directly to the
  SGs.  IN this configuration, the combination of each ASP and SG form
  the two Implementations Under Test (IUT).

    For this configuration, the interface between the MTP Level 3
  Simulator and the M2UA ASP is the same as for normal SS7 MTP Level 2

  Testing [Q.780], [Q.781], [M2PATEST07].  The test environment SHOULD
  include monitoring of the M2UA SCTP Association to ensure the mapping
  between SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.703], [M2PA] signals, SS7 MTP Level 2 Test
  Specification [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] commands, and SS7 MTP2-User
  Adaptation Layer [M2UA] messages as described in Section 4.

2.2.  Testing Methodologies

2.2.1.  Test Sequence

    Testing of a particular M2UA SG implementation SHOULD be performed
  in the following order.

   (1)   Validation Test Configuration #1 -- validation tests [Q.781
         or M2PATEST07] directly.

   (2)   Validation Test Configuration #2 -- validation tests [Q.781
         or M2PATEST07] with M2UA interface between SG and MTP Level 3
         Simulator.

   (3)   Compatibility Test Configuration #1 -- compatibility tests
         [Q.781 or M2PATEST07] directly.

Internet-Draft                M2UA-SS7TEST              February 3, 2007

   (4)   Compatibility Test Configuration #2 -- compatibility tests
         [Q.781 or M2PATEST07] with M2UA interface between SG and MTP
         Level 3 Simulator.

    Testing of a particular M2UA ASP implementation against an SG
  implementation (already tested per above) SHOULD be performed in the
  following order:

   (5)   Validation Test Configuration #3 -- validation tests [Q.781
         or M2PATEST07] directly, with SG/ASP interaction within the
         IUT.

   (6)   Compatibility Test Configuration #3 -- compatibility tests
         [Q.781 or M2PATEST07] directly, with SG/ASP interaction within
         the IUT.

    In addtion, validation testing of the M2UA protocol between ASP and
  SG SHOULD be performed independent of SS7 MTP Level 2 validation
  testing in accordance with a validation test suite for M2UA<1>.  Also,
  compatibility testing of the M2UA protocol between ASP and SG SHOULD
  be performed independent of SS7 MTP Level 2 compatibility testing in
  accordance with a compatibility test suite for M2UA<2>.

    The normal methodology for testing SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.781],
  [M2PATEST07] is to perform validation testing on an IUT before
  performing compatibility testing.  The tests presented in [Q.781
  and M2PATEST07] test the functionality of the MTP Level 2 state
  machines; however, they do not adequately test the L2 to L3 interface.

    To complete validation and compatibility testing of M2UA, the
  validation and compatibility tests presented in the SS7 MTP Level 3
  Test Specification [Q.782] SHOULD be performed with the M2UA ASP in
  the test environment to assure that the M2UA IUT has properly
  implemented the L2 to L3 interface.  The test environment for
  executing [Q.782] tests are outside the scope of this document.

   (7)   MTP Level 3 Validation Tests -- validation tests [Q.781]
         performed with SG/ASP interaction within the IUT.

   (8)   MTP Level 3 Compatibility Tests -- compatibility tests [Q.781]
         performed with SG/ASP interaction within the IUT.

Notes for Section 2

  <1>  At the time of writing this memo, there did not exist an IETF
       validation test suite specification for the M2UA protocol.  The
       author of this memo is working on the development of such a
       specification.

  <2>  At the timer of writing this memo, there did not exist an IETF
       compatibility test suite specificaiton for the M2UA protocol.
       There does exist, however, several M2UA Interop test plans that
       come close to such a specification.  The author of this memo is
       also working on the development of such a specification.

3.  Tests

    This section details the validation and compatibility tests to be
  performed.

3.1.  Test Cases

    In each test configuration, the applicable Validation tests or
  Compatibility tests of the SS7 MTP Level 2 Test Specification [Q.781],
  [M2PATEST07], or other applicatble SS7 MTP Level 2 test specification,
  SHALL be performed.

4.  Mapping of Signals

    The mapping of SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.703], [M2PA] signals, SS7 MTP
  Level 2 Test [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] commands, and SS7 MTP2-User
  Adaptation Layer [M2UA] messages are listed in Table 1.  Each [Q.703],
  [M2PA] signal SHALL be mapped onto a [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] command or
  indication and onto a [M2UA] message.  When the SS7 MTP Level 2
  [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] test case calls for a given [Q.703], [M2PA]
  signal or [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] command or indication, the
  corresponding [M2UA] message SHALL be injected or collected by the MTP
  Level 3 Simulator.

  Notes for Table 1:

  <1>  MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] do not
       provide a notation for "In Service" indication; however, in a
       number of test cases it is necessary to establish that the link
       is in the "In Service" state.  The ESTABLISH Confirm [M2UA]
       message sent by the SG can be used to confirm that the link has
       acheived the "In Service" state.

  <2>  MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] do not
       provide a notation for "Link Failure" indication; however, in a

Internet-Draft                M2UA-SS7TEST              February 3, 2007

       number of test cases it is necessary to establish that the link
       has failed.  The RELEASE Indication [M2UA] message sent by the SG
       can be used to confirm that the link has failed.

  <3>  MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] do not
       provide a notation for "Flush Buffers," "Clear RTB," "Continue,"
       or "Resume."  However, use of these primitives is necessary in
       some test cases (e.g. test case 4.1 [Q.781], test case 3.4.1
       [M2PATEST07]).  The STATE Request [M2UA] message with the
       STATUS_FLUSH_BUFFERS, STATUS_CLEAR_RTB or STATUS_CONTINUE state
       values SHOULD be used to perform these functions.

  <4>  MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] do not
       require the use of this request.

  <5>  There are no SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.703], [M2PA] signals or SS7 MTP
       Level 2 Test [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] actions that correspond to
       these [M2UA] messages; however, these messages are required by
       the [M2UA] specifications and it SHOULD be verified that the SG
       issues these messages to the test enviroment under the
       appropriate conditions during testing.

  <6>  Although SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.703], [M2PA] provides signals to SS7
       MTP Level 3 [Q.704] indicating congesiton onset and abatement
       that use these [M2UA] messages, SS7 MTP Level 2 Tests [Q.781],
       [M2PATEST07] do not perform congestion testing that would
       generate these indications to the test environment.

  <7>  MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] do not test
       retrieval.  Retrieval tests are performed by SS7 MTP Level 3
       testing [Q.782].

  <8>  MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] do not have
       a notation for signalling messages (other than indicating that an
       MSU is sent or received); however, signalling messages are
       exchanged between L2 and L3 as a normal course of most of the SS7
       MTP Level 2 tests [Q.781], [M2PATEST07].

  <9>  MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] do not
       provide a notation for "Remote Processor Outage" or "Remote
       Processor Recovered" indications.  These indications are not
       required in SS7 MTP Level 2 tests [Q.781], [M2PATEST07]; however,
       these indications SHOULD be delivered to the test environment on
       entry and exit from the "Remote Processour Outage" state.

  <10> MTP Level 2 Test Specifications [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] defines
       these signals, and these signals are required within the test
       environment [Q.780], [M2PATEST07]; however, these signals are
       outside the scope of the SS7 MTP2-User Adaptation Layer [M2UA]
       protocol and SHOULD be generated by other means.

       Note that it is possible that some implementations might use the
       REGISTRATION Request or ASP-ACTIVE [M2UA] messages for powering

       on the signalling link.

    All of the applicable validation or compatibility tests of the SS7
  MTP Level 2 Test Specification [Q.781], [M2PATEST07] SHALL be
  performed in this fashion with the mapping presented in Table 1.  For
  other SS7 Conformance Test Specifications, a similar mapping and the
  test configurations presented SHOULD be used.
