Abstract

   To support the utility of Brand Indicators for Message Identification
   (BIMI), domains publishing BIMI records may find it useful to know
   when their logos are failing to be displayed as expected.  When an
   entity, for example a mailbox operator, determines whether or not to
   display the logo identified in the BIMI record, they may encounter
   errors trying to retrieve the image file.  Similarly, the associated
   evidence document used to validate the logo may fail evaluation.  In
   other cases, the evaluator may decide that despite everything
   validating, they may rely on local policies that determine validated
   logos should still not be displayed.  This specification defines how
   BIMI evaluators should report their evaluation outcome back to the
   publisher within the context of existing Domain-based Message
   Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) reports.

1.  Introduction

   Organizations sending email associated with specific brands and
   domains may use Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI)
   [I-D.blank-ietf-bimi] to signal which brand identifier (e.g. a
   company logo) should be displayed when receiving authenticated email
   for the specified domain.  This document is intended as a companion
   to the BIMI specification as it defines the associated error
   reporting method and schema.  It includes information necessary for
   Domain Owners to identify and troubleshoot potential issues related
   to the evaluation of the elements identified within their BIMI
   records.

   The document supports the ability for a domain sending email to
   identify and diagnose problems with their BIMI deployment.  It is
   designed to be as easy to deploy as possible for BIMI reporters and
   report consumers.  It integrates with existing Domain-based Message
   Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) [RFC7489]

   aggregate reporting (RUA) rather than adding a new reporting
   mechanism.  The data being reported is aggregated in a way that
   respects the privacy of senders, receivers, and users by not leaking
   potentially sensitive information.


   This document is intended as a companion to the BIMI specification
   draft [I-D.blank-ietf-bimi] by adding reporting abilities.

1.1.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

   This document is designed to operate within the context of Internet
   Mail service, as defined in [RFC5598], as well as the reporting
   structure defined by [RFC7489].  In addition to the terms defined
   below, some terminology throughout the document has been inherited
   from those specifications.

   Aligned Domain:  The FQDN that passes the DMARC evaluation to
      determine where to initially look the associated DMARC policy
      record.

   Assertion Domain:  The FQDN where the BIMI record associated with an
      email is found.

   Evaluator:  The entity or organization that evaluates the BIMI
      assertions when an email is received and has passed DMARC
      evaluation.  This may be the email receiver (e.g. the MX server
      identified as the inbound MTA gateway), or another entity that
      processes the email later in the email evaluation pipeline.  For
      example, an MTA may perform DMARC and BIMI evaluation within a
      single authentication process, while in some contexts DMARC
      evaluation may occur at a perimeter MTA while BIMI evaluation is
      performed by another MTA later in the process (which may or may
      not be operated by the same organization).

   Report:  The data compiled by the Evaluator about how it evaluated
      BIMI in relation to email sent from, or on behalf of, a specified
      domain.

   Reporter:  The operator that sends Reports to the Report Consumer
      identified within the applicable DMARC record.

Internet-Draft               BIMI Reporting                   March 2021


   Report Consumer:  An operator that receives Reports from a Reporter
      implementing the reporting mechanism described in this document.
      Such an operator might be receiving reports about its own
      messages, or Reports about messages related to another operator.
      This term applies collectively to the system components that
      receive and process these reports and the organizations that
      operate them.

   Selector Name:  The name of the BIMI selector, if one exists, within
      the designated header field in an email.  If no specific BIMI
      selector is identified, the Selector Name is assumed to be
      "default".

2.  Identifying the Report Consumer

   Given that BIMI relies on DMARC evaluation, this document does not
   define a separate Report Consumer outside the context of DMARC.  The
   BIMI Report MUST be included as part of a DMARC report sent to the
   RUA address identified within the applicable DMARC record for the
   email being evaluated.  The applicable Report address is determined
   by the DMARC policy discovered for the Aligned Domain of the sending
   email.  This may be the Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) [RFC1983],
   or Organizational Domain as determined by DMARC evaluation.  Note
   that the domain of the applicable DMARC policy may not be the same
   domain where the applicable BIMI record is discovered.

2.1.  Example 1: Subdomain Reporting

   For example, consider the following situation in which an
   Organizational Domain (i.e. "example.com") has slightly different
   DMARC and BIMI reporting configurations for the two FQDNs:

   Domain: example.com  *  Publishes a DMARC record
      *  Requests RUA reports be sent to
         "rua@example.com"
      *  Publishes a BIMI record

   Domain: sub.example.com  *  Publishes a DMARC record
      *  Requests RUA reports sent to
         "rua@sub.example.com"
      *  Does not publish a BIMI record

   When the organization sends email with the [RFC5322].From domain set
   to "sub.example.com", the Evaluator does not find a BIMI record at
   the FQDN, but does find one at the Organizational Domain level:
   "example.com".

Internet-Draft               BIMI Reporting                   March 2021


   The Evaluator sends BIMI reports to the applicable report consumer
   identified within the Aligned Domain's DMARC record:
   "rua@sub.example.com", not to the RUA address associated with the
   Organizational Domain where the BIMI record was discovered.

2.2.  Example 2: Inherited Reporting

   In another example, consider another situation in which an
   Organizational Domain (i.e. "example.com") has slightly different
   DMARC and BIMI reporting configurations for the two FQDNs:

   Domain: example.com  *  Publishes a DMARC record covering all
         subdomains
      *  Requests RUA reports be sent to
         "rua@example.com"
      *  Publishes a BIMI record

   Domain: sub.example.com  *  Does not publish a DMARC record
      *  Does not publish a BIMI record

   When the organization sends email with the [RFC5322].From domain set
   to "sub.example.com", the Evaluator does not find a BIMI record at
   the FQDN, but does find one at the Organizational Domain level:
   "example.com".

   The Evaluator sends BIMI reports to the applicable report consumer
   identified for the Aligned Domain which is discovered within the
   applicable DMARC record published at the organizational domain:
   "rua@example.com".

3.  Reporting Schema

   The following data defined in this section MUST be reported within
   the context of an XML-formatted DMARC [RFC7489] Aggregate Report
   (RUA).  Given the reliance on DMARC evaluation, the BIMI Reports are
   sent as additional elements within RUA reports, inheriting its
   terminology and metadata (e.g. "date_range", "report_id", etc.).

   The complete set of BIMI Report elements and attributes are collected
   within a single top-level <bimi> element within the RUA <xml> root
   element (i.e. at the same level as the <record> elements).  The
   <bimi> element SHOULD be the last top-level element within the <xml>
   root element, but MAY be placed in any order in relation to other
   top-level elements.

   The nested structure of the elements is illustrated below.  The
   attributes and contents for each element are described in more detail
   in the following sections.

               <assertion>[count]</assertion>
               <evidence>[count]</evidence>
               <indicator>[count]</indicator>

             </errors>
           </assertion>
         </domain>
       </bimi>

3.1.  <domain> Element

   Within the <bimi> element is one or more <domain> elements, each
   element of which MUST include the following attributes:

   "aligned" (REQUIRED):  The Aligned Domain.

   "assertion" (REQUIRED):  The Assertion Domain.

   Each <domain> element MUST represent a unique "aligned":"assertion"
   tuple within the enclosing <bimi> element.  All BIMI assertion
   records related to this domain tuple MUST be reported within this
   element.

3.2.  <assertion> Element

   The content of each <domain> element MUST include one or more
   <assertion> elements, each element of which MUST include the
   following attributes:

   "selector" (REQUIRED):  The Selector Name defined by the relevant
      email header, or set to "default" if no Selector Name was
      specifically defined.

   "l" (REQUIRED):  The field extracted from the "l=" field within the
      BIMI assertion record.  If blank, the attribute label MUST be
      present, and the attribute MUST be set to "upublished".

   "a" (REQUIRED):  The field extracted from the "a=" field within the
      BIMI assertion record.  If blank, the attribute label MUST be
      present, and the attribute MUST be left blank (i.e. a="")

Internet-Draft               BIMI Reporting                   March 2021


   Each <assertion> element MUST represent a unique "selector":"l":"a"
   tuple within the enclosing <domain> element.  All errors related to
   this assertion tuple MUST be reported within this element.

   In the case in which a non-default Selector Name is provided, but the
   evaluation of the referenced selector results in an error, and
   evaluation of the default selector also results in an error, both the
   initial error and the default selector errors are reported within
   separate <assertion> elements.  One <assertion> element will include
   the "selector" attribute set to "default"', and the other will
   include the "selector" attribute set to the Selector Name identified
   in the email.

3.3.  <evidence> Element

   The <evidence> element is OPTIONAL and is only REQUIRED if the
   attributes as described below are included in the Report.  The
   <evidence> element is a null element that contains the following
   attributes:

   "evidence-date" (OPTIONAL):  A [RFC5322]-formatted date expression
      indicating when the evidence document was evaluated.  Evaluators
      MAY periodically evaluate Evidence Documents and locally cache the
      results for some period of time before re-evaluating them.

   "evidence-issuer" (OPTIONAL):  The issuer of the Evidence Document
      retrieved and evaluated.

   "evidence-type" (OPTIONAL):  The type of Evidence Document retrieved
      and evaluated.

   "evidence-url" (OPTIONAL; REQUIRED if the "a=" field is
   populated):  The URL defined by the "a=" field within the BIMI record
      pointing to the authority Evidence Document.  If the field exists
      and is populated, but evaluation of the field results in errors
      during parsing or retrieval, the attribute is set to the value of
      the "a=" field, and the appropriate set of "evidence-error-"
      elements (defined below) are populated).

3.4.  <errors> Element

   All errors to be reported MUST be included within the <errors>
   element which is within the <assertion> element.  Within the <errors>
   element are one or more elements containing the error data aggregated
   as described below.  If there are no errors within a reporting
   period, the <errors> element MUST NOT exist in the Report.

Internet-Draft               BIMI Reporting                   March 2021


   The count of non-zero errors being reported MUST be grouped by the
   logical tuple:

      ERROR-NAME:class:type

   Where ERROR-NAME is an element named one of:

   *  "assertion"
   *  "evidence"
   *  "indicator"
   *  "undefined"

   The "class" for each error tuple is set to one of:

   "temp"  If the Evaluator determines that the error is temporary (e.g.
      a recoverable error such as a DNS query timeout when trying to
      retrieve the resource), the Evaluator MAY rely on a previously
      cached result and SHOULD set the class of the error to "temp".
      Doing so indicates the Evaluator will try again in the future for
      updated results.  For example, a temporary error may cause an
      Evaluator to stop processing BIMI for a single message, but try
      again for the next message it receives from the domain.

   "perm"  If the Evaluator determines that the error is permanent (e.g.
      the resource is successfully retrieved, but is non-conformant),
      the Evaluator SHOULD set the class to "perm".  Doing so indicates
      the Evaluator MAY stop evaluating BIMI for all messages from the
      specified domain until additional information becomes available.

   The "type" component of the tuple is defined for the specific error
   elements in their descriptions below.

   There MUST only be one instance of a specific error tuple per Report,
   each of which aggregates the count of errors associated with that
   tuple during the report period.  There MAY be multiple error elements
   with the same name, but the tuples MUST be differentiated by distinct
   element attributes.

   For example, the <errors> element may contain two <indicator> error
   elements.  One <indicator> error element may contain a "class=temp"
   attribute, while the other may contain a "class=perm" attribute.
   Each of which aggreates the count of the specified class of errors.

3.4.1.  <assertion> Errors Element

   The <assertion> errors element is OPTIONAL and is only REQUIRED if
   there are assertion errors to report.  The <assertion> error element
   encloses a positive natural number indicating the count of assertion
   errors encountered during the reporting period for the set of element
   attributes indicating the class, type, and (optionally) description:

   "class" Attribute:  Set to either "temp" or "perm" depending upon
      whether the Evaluator is treating the errors as temporary or
      permanent.

   "type" Attribute:  Set to one of:

   *  "retrieval" if the Evaluator was unable to successfully retrieve
      the assertion record (e.g. receiving a DNS RCODE:3 when trying to
      retrieve the selector)

   *  "parsing" if one or more fields in the BIMI assertion record fails
      to parse (e.g. the value in the "l=" or "a=" fields contain
      unexpected characters)

   "description" Attribute (OPTIONAL):  Free-form text provided by the
      Evaluator indicating any specific details they believe useful to
      understanding the error(s).  The element SHOULD contain no more
      than 256 characters.

3.4.2.  <evidence> Errors Element

   The <evidence> errors element is OPTIONAL and is only REQUIRED if
   there are evidence errors to report.  The <evidence> error element
   encloses a positive natural number indicating the count of evidence
   errors encountered during the reporting period for the set of element
   attributes indicating the class, type, and (optionally) description:

   "class" Attribute:  Set to either "temp" or "perm" depending upon
      whether the Evaluator is treating the errors as temporary or
      permanent.

   "type" Attribute:  Set to one of:

   *  "retrieval" if the Evaluator was unable to successfully retrieve
      the authority evidence document (e.g. receiving a DNS RCODE:3 when
      trying to retrieve the document)

   *  "parsing" if the authority evidence document in the BIMI record
      fails to parse (e.g. the URI identified in the BIMI record
      contains invalid characters)

   *  "validation" if the retrieved authority evidence document fails to
      validate (e.g. the retrieved X.509 [RFC5280] certificate fails to
      validate)

   *  "expired" if the authority evidence document has expired (e.g. the
      retrieved X.509 certificate expiration date has passed at the time
      of validation)

   *  "revoked" if the authority evidence document has been reported as
      being revoked (e.g. the X.509 certificate being evaluated, or any
      in its progenitor chain, have been reported to the issuer's
      Certificate Revocation List)

   *  "policy" if the Evaluator determines that, even if the authority
      evidence document is technically validated, they have additional
      information that may impact the evaluation (e.g. the Evaluator has
      a local policy that doesn't recognize the issuing authority, the
      evidence type is deemed insufficient, etc.)

   "description" Attribute:  Free-form text provided by the Evaluator
      indicating any specific details they believe useful to
      understanding the error(s).  The element SHOULD contain no more
      than 256 characters.

3.4.3.  <indicator> Errors Element

   The <indicator> errors element is OPTIONAL and is only REQUIRED if
   there are indicator errors to report.  The <indicator> errors element
   encloses a positive natural number indicating the count of indicator
   errors encountered during the reporting period for the set of element
   attributes indicating the class, type, and (optionally) description:

   "class" Attribute:  Set to either "temp" or "perm" depending upon
      whether the Evaluator is treating the errors as temporary or
      permanent.

   "type" Attribute:  Set to one of:

   *  "retrieval" if the Evaluator was unable to successfully retrieve
      the indicator (e.g. receiving a DNS RCODE:3 when trying to
      retrieve the indicator)

   *  "parsing" if the indicator in the BIMI record fails to parse (e.g.
      the indicator cannot be extracted from the presented evidence
      document)

   *  "validation" if the Evaluator cannot validate that the indicator
      can be used in the context of BIMI (e.g. the SVG document
      referenced by the "l=" URI isn't a valid SVG Tiny Portable Secure
      (SVG P/S) [I-D.svg-tiny-ps-abrotman] profile)

   "description" (OPTIONAL):  Free-form text provided by the Evaluator
      indicating any specific details they believe useful to
      understanding the error(s).  The element SHOULD contain no more
      than 256 characters

3.4.4.  <undefined> Errors Element

   The <undefined> errors element is OPTIONAL and SHOULD be used to
   report errors that are not covered by other error elements.  The
   <undefined> errors element encloses a positive natural number
   indicating the count of undefined errors encountered during the
   reporting period for the set of element attributes indicating the
   class and (optionally) description:

   "class" Attribute:  Set to either "temp" or "perm" depending upon
