Abstract

   This document provides an overview of models for MANET and NEMO.  It
   descibes the MANET and the NEMO characteristics.  It also also lists
   problems using the MANET and NEMO technology, when problems are not
   described in other documents.  It is claimed that MANET suits small
   mobile network topologies, providing optimal paths for communication
   within a MANET cloud and towards the outside.  It is also claimed
   that NEMO suits small mobile subnets, providing sub-optimal paths for
   to Internet connected nodes.  This document is used for evaluating a
   need for a MANET for NEMO, called MANEMO.

1.  Introduction

   IP technology is increasingly being used in mobile networks.  Many
   issues arise with mobility, for example wireless bandwidth and link
   quality are typically low related to fixed, wired infrastructures.
   Also routing protocols for mobile environments are faced with new
   challenges; connectivity comes and goes when nodes move and link
   quality increases and decreases instead of flapping between an OK and
   an NOT-OK state.

   Two IETF mobility technologies are available, that is Mobile Ad-hoc
   NETworks (MANET) [1], [2] and Mobile IP (MIP).

   The MANET workgroup is working on routing protocols, running on
   mobile or fixed routers; either in small isolated topologies or at
   edges of large IP infrastructures.  Multiple types of MANET protocols
   exist; OLSR [3] is a proactive MANET protocol populating the routing
   table independent of any user traffic; DYMO [4] is a reactive
   protocol, providing path information for traffic flows and SMF [5] is
   a multicast flooding protocol.

   The MIP4 and MIP6 workgroups are working on mobility support for
   hosts, enabling session continuity while moving.  Other workgroups
   are working on improvements on MIP, for example MONAMI6 and MIPSHOP
   are working on using multiple interfaces towards the IP
   infrastructure.  The NEMO workgroup extends MIP using the Mobile
   Router concept, providing MIP services for MR attached nodes.  With
   NEMO, nesting can occur, introducing new challenges.

   Currently, a number of communities are working on network
   architectures for mobile domains.  Different communities work on
   different domains, all having their specific requirements.  Work
   within the IETF would comply with all those requirements.  Sample
   domains are military, public safety / emergency response networks,
   mobile networks used by enterprises and non-governmental
   organizations, provider based Internet access, license-free wireless
   networks and networks for intelligent transport systems / vehicle
   communication systems.  Also combinations of multiple domains can be
   used, for example a mobile network for a disaster relief organization
   could use own licensed transmission means, provider based Internet
   access and license-free wireless networks; all used in cars also
   equipped with an inter-vehicle communication system / intelligent
   transport system.

3.  MANET classification and models for hierarchy

   MANETs can be classified based on different deployment scenarios.
   The classical MANET approach focused on a single, contiguous MANET
   region.  Now MANET technology is getting mature, focus is shifting
   towards interfacing between different MANETs and MANETs connected to
   the Internet.  This section provides a classification of MANETs and
   models for MANET hierarchy.

   Deployed MANETs can inherit characteristics of different models.

3.1.  Sub-IP MANET

   MANET technology can be used below the IP layer.  The MANET forms a
   single IP subnet, where nodes can reach each other transparently.
   The subnetwork provides full connectivity for unicast and multicast /
   broadcast.  RFC3819 [20] provides advice on subnetworks.

          +-----------------------+
            :                :
            :                :           : = Classic IP Interface

          +---+            +---+


                          Figure 1: Sub-IP MANET

   Sub-IP MANETs are transparent for the IP layer and do not introduce
   special requirements.

3.2.  Isolated MANET

   An Isolated MANET is a single, contiguous MANET region.  MANET
   routers within the MANET region provide connectivity to attached
   hosts.  No Routers are attached to an Isolated MANET.

3.4.  Stub MANET

   Stub MANETs are connected to a Fixed Infrastructure or the Internet.
   Connectivity to the Fixed Infrastructure is provided with default
   routes.  Connectivity to the Stub MANET can be provided with an
   aggregated prefix.

   A Stub MANET could have redundant MANET Border Interfaces.  The Stub
   MANET will not act as transit region.

3.5.  Layered MANETs

   MANETs can have a layered structure.  Connection to the top level is
   similar to a Fixed Infrastructure connection.  The lowest level can
   be configured as Stub MANETs.  MANETs in the middle layers provide
   transit services.

4.  Fringe Stub models

   In the (Wireless) Fringe Stub, an almost infinite wireless ad-hoc
   topology is connected to a Fixed Infrastructure.  The Fringe Stub is
   not required to be continuous, the Fixed Infrastructure is used to
   interconnect isolated segments.  Mobile Routers can roam between
   isolated segments without any reconfiguration.

   In the Fringe Stub models, Layer-2 Access, Layer-2 Meshing, Mobile
   IP, NEMO and MANET technologies are used.  Deployed Fringe Stubs can
   inherit characteristics of different models.

4.1.  Layer-2 Access

   Mobile nodes can use a layer-2 Access service provided by
   telecommunication providers.  Classical IP interfacing is used, so
   special requirements are introduced.  Depending on the provider or
   the technology used, micro mobility or macro mobility is provided.

4.2.  Layer-2 Meshing

   For reducing costs of the infrastructure or to extend area of reach,
   Relay Stations can be used to enhance the Layer-2 Access model.  This
   provide also some kind of redundancy.  When the Base Station is
   isolated from the backbone, an alternative path via another Base
   Station can be used.

4.3.  Node Mobility

   MIP (MIP4 [13] and MIP6 [14]) provide mobility and handover
   functionalities to mobile nodes.  Mobile IP is targeted for providing
   "macro mobility".  It provides session continuity over different
   heterogeneous network types and provides global roaming.  "Micro
   mobility" using link-layer mobility services would provide better
   handover performance [13].  Optimizing handover using IP technology
   is work-in-progress.

   The MR serves local connected hosts and local connected routers,

   reaching the HA, either directly when at home or via the MIP tunnel
   when the MR is at a foreign network.  Mobility service is provided
   via the "Ingress Interface" for a Mobile Subnet.

4.5.  Nested NEMO

   With NEMO, visiting mobile nodes are supported, this is because MRs
   are able to connect to the Ingress interface of other MRs and
   configure their CoAs/receive connectivity via the MR they are

   Nested Mobile Routers form tree topologies.  Pin-ball routing is
   introduced, discussed in a section on Route Optimization below.

4.6.  MANEMO

   With MANEMO [21], [22], MANET technology is introduced in Nested
   NEMO.  The main goals are implementing NEMO Route Optimizing,
   supporting floating Nested NEMO topologies and providing optimized
   paths within the MANEMO Fringe Stub without using NEMO tunneling.

   A suggested solution is using a tree discovery protocol [23].  The
   tree structure is used for optimizing packet forwarding between
   Mobile Nodes and the Exit Router [24], [25].  The tree can also be
   used for inner-tree communication and multicast support.

   Another suggested solution is to use direct communication between

   Also using MANET technology is suggested [22], [27].

Internet-Draft         Analysis of MANET and NEMO              June 2007


5.  MANET and NEMO Characteristics

5.1.  Scalability

   MANET and NEMO have very different goals.  MANET can provide
   optimized paths within a limited topology, where NEMO provides
   Internet scale end-to-end connectivity.  Therefore, scalability
   characteristics for MANET and NEMO are very different.

   MANET scalability is researched and many improvements are proposed.
   But still MANET networks have their limits, a large number (100 or
   more) of Mobile Routers in a flat area is a topic for active research
   [2].  Other technology must be used to provide Internet scale
   deployment.

   The OSPF MANET extension [28], [29] is applicable for a limited
   number of routers interconnected with radio interfaces.  Such a MANET
   subnetwork would be part of an OSPF area, and OSPF (and BGP) routing
   state flooding reduction mechanisms enable large scale deployment.
   Many independent OSPF MANET subnetworks can de deployed, similar to
   for example Ethernet segment scalability.

   Other MANET protocols could use the same approach.  A MANET domain
   can be connected to a fixed infrastructure and route aggregation
   hides routing state flooding.

   NEMO makes use of the MIP tunnel overlay, hiding mobility on the
   fixed Internet infrastructure.  The number of mobile networks scales
   with the number of home agents, and address aggregation enables huge
   scale NEMO deployment.

5.2.  Mobility

   With MANET, a MNR can roam within an area where sufficient coverage
   is available.  When the number of MANs increase, coverage will
   improve or the area will be enlarged.  Scalability issues restrict
   the number of MANs, which implies restrictions on mobility.  Zoned or
   hierarchical models are proposed, but world wide mobility would not
   be provided by MANET.

   With NEMO, "macro mobility" is inherited from Mobile IP.  Worldwide
   mobility can be provided for an almost unlimited number of MRs, all
   having end-to-end connectivity.

   For both MANET and NEMO, mobility is also related to radio coverage.
   No coverage implies no connectivity.

Internet-Draft         Analysis of MANET and NEMO              June 2007


5.3.  HA dependency

   MANET does not depend on Mobile IP and doesn't need a home agent.

   NEMO extends Mobile IP using a Mobile Router.  The Mobile Router
   maintains a tunnel to its home agent.  Traffic between LFN and CN
   flows through the tunnel and thus the home agent is a critical
   element for communication.  HA dependency can be relaxed by HA
   redundancy or new protocols, like Global HA to HA protocol (HAHA)
   [17] / [18].  MIP and NEMO Route Optimization could also relax the HA
   dependency.

   For communication from a NEMO LFN to a far away CN, the HA dependency
   may not be a problem.  But for local communication, this could be
   unacceptable, especially in military and public safety / emergency
   response networks, where local communication availability is a
   primary concern.

5.4.  Route optimization

   MANET protocols would select a shortest path (fewest hops, lowest
   metric) or an optimized path based on cross-layer metrics.  Problems
   with optimized path selection based on fewest hop count are described
   below in section Worst Path First Syndrome.

   Currently, nested NEMO based on NEMO BS [9] lacks intelligent path
   selection.  RA sent by MR are equivalent to RA sent by a fixed Access
   Router.  Selecting an Attachement Router without any knowledge on
   path metrics would select non-optimal paths.  Nested NEMO has high
   tunnel header overhead and a pinball route problem.  Also route loops
   can occur (NEMO RO) [10].

5.5.  Interface type

   In the MANET architecture, a MANET-Interface is an interface with a
   MANET protocol enabled.  Typical behavior is the relay function,
   incoming traffic on this interface can be relayed to serve other
   nodes increasing connectivity in the MANET topology [30].

   In Mobility Related Terminology [7], The Ingress and Egress Interface
   types are introduced.  Terms are related to the NEMO mobile Router
   model [9].  The Ingress Interface is the interface with the Mobile
   Network Nodes connected to.  The Egress Interface is the interface
   the Mobile Router uses to attach to the fixed infrastructure.

   When discussions started about integrating MANET and NEMO, the
   difference between the MANET and Egress interface faded.  Also a
   discussion about the need for a MANEMO Ingress Interfaces started, as

Internet-Draft         Analysis of MANET and NEMO              June 2007


   in MANET there is no need for special handling, and in MANEMO any
   router interface could be MANET enabled.  For policy reasons, a
   MANEMO router interface could be defined as Ingress only.

5.6.  Multicast support

   In MANET environment, classical multicast forwarding using a Reverse
   Path Forwarding Check cannot be used.  The MANET interface is used
   for relaying IP packets, and a basic forwarding rule is broken,
   specifying that an IP multicast packet is never sent back over the
   incoming interface.

   Multiple MANET multicast protocols are proposed, but many of them
   showed large overhead for keeping state information.  Currently the
   MANET workgroup is working on SMF [5].  SMF use 2-hop neighbor state
   provided by another protocol (currently NHDP [31]) for efficient
   flooding combined with duplicate packet detection.

   In NEMO, multicast service can be provided.  Within the Mobile
   Network itself, basic multicasting is used.  Global multicast
   supported can also be provided; the MR relays the multicast to the
   HA, where the multicast flow is injected in the fixed infrastructure.
   Receiving multicast from the fixed infrastructure is also supported,
   the HA relays the multicast flow via the tunnel to the MR and the
   FLNs.

   Multicasting between nearby NEMO MRs would have large overhead, as
   the multicast is lead over the HAs.  Also multicast from the fixed
   infrastructure to multiple nearby NEMO MRs is inefficient, as the
   multicast flow is pseudo-broadcasted over multiple tunnels to these
   MRs.  Options for improved NEMO multicast support are proposed, e.g.
   using MLD-proxy [32].

6.  Problems found in MANET and NEMO

   This section is used as placeholder for problems in MANET or NEMO,
   which are not maintained in separate IETF Problem Statement
   documents.

6.1.  Worst Path First Syndrome

   Classic routing protocols use the hop-count as metric for best path
   selecting.  Hop-count is still used in modern MANET routing
   protocols.  For homogeneous topologies, where all links have similar
   capabilities, this could be seen as sufficient.  But when different
   link types are used or link characteristics vary in time and on a
   neighbor by neighbor basis, problems are introduced.  Using cross-
   layer information is seen as helpful for MANET environments[2].

   NEMO / nested NEMO do currently not select a path based on metrics.

   The Worst Path First Syndrome is a name given to a behavior of a path
   selection algorithm, selecting the path to a destination using the
   fewest hops, but also the worst quality links.  Using ad-hoc networks
   with broadcast radios, link quality and data rate would be a function
   of distance and influenced by obstacles.  In the example below, a
   high quality radio link uses a data rate of 11Mbps and has a packet
   loss below 1%.  A bad quality radio link uses a data rate of 1Mbps
   and has a packet loss around 50%.

   from both R1 and R2 are received.  A MANET protocol, selecting a path
   based on hop-count, selects the direct path to R1.  NEMO would select
   R1 or R2, as it has no knowledge of the topology.

   Selecting the direct path to R1 is the worst in terms of bandwidth
   (1Mbps where 11Mbps is available), packet loss (50% where less than
   2% is available) and used spectrum (single transmission over 1Mbps
   takes more time for sending a packet than 2 times over 11Mbps).  The
   direct path to R1 would require more retransmissions if reliable data
   transfer is supported.

   In a heterogeneous topology, the problem becomes totally
   unacceptable.  Imagine that the three Rs are temporally "on the
   pause" and R2 and R3 are near to each other.  Because R3 has bad user
   experience, it can be serviced by using cabling to R2 and the
   bandwidth is increased to 100Mbps and the packet loss is zero.
   Still, user experience is not enhanced at all, and R1 would be
   selected.

   Defining solutions for this problem is out of scope of this document.
   A suggested approach is using path metrics based on cross layer
   metrics.

6.2.  Break Before Make problem

   The Break Before Make (BBM) [7], problem occurs when links suddenly
   fail and there is no pre-warning mechanism.  Classic routing
   protocols suffer from BBM, as problems in fixed infrastructures are
   mostly caused by equipment failures and these problems are hard to
   predict.  Modern protocols have support for L2-triggers, speeding up
   connection repair time.

   Graceful shutdown is a mechanism that is for predicted outages.
   Before the outage, neighbors are signaled the node or link is taken
   out of service and an alternative path is selected, if available.  In
   a wireless infrastructure, especially when elements are moving, link
   quality is varying and getting out-of-reach can be detected by
   layer-2 mechanisms or by detecting packet loss, e.g. provided by a
   hello protocol.  The decreased link quality can be signaled to the
   neighbors, and alternative paths can be selected before the link
   breaks.  Such concepts are called Make Before Break (MBB) [7].

   When hop count metrics are used, varying link quality is not taken
   into account and links are used until the become really out of reach.
   This is similar to the WPF syndrome described above.

   Defining solutions for this problem is out of scope of this document.
   A suggested approach is using path metrics based on cross layer link

   metrics.

6.3.  Routing loops in proactive routing protocols

   Loops in classical unicast routing could take place when an interface
   state changes.  When an interface goes down, the routing table is
   adjusted quickly for removing entries with a next hop via this
   interface.  Alternative routes could be used quickly also.  Other
   router routing tables are updated after routing protocol activity;
   this could take milliseconds up to minutes, depending on protocol and
   timer settings.  During this convergence, routing loops can occur and
   packet starvation is handled by TTL mechanism.

   On wireless media, using TTL for starvation could have a high impact
   on radio resources and spectrum utilization.

   In the following scenario, a hop-count based metric is used.  Routers
   are located around an obstacle and a ring topology is formed due to
   radio propagation.  In the scenario, R5 is moving away from R4.

   +----+        +----+        +----+

      |                          |

   | R4 |----------------------| R5 |  R5 moves this way --->
   +----+                      +----+


                  Figure 13: MANET routing loop scenario

   When R5 is moved, the neighbor state for R4 and R5 goes down.

                     Figure 14: Neighbor down detected

   R4 and R5 detect the change due to the hello mechanism or L2
   triggers.  After R4 is aware of the failure, it immediately adjusts
   its routing table.  It uses R1 as next hop for traffic to R5.
   However, R1 is still not aware of the topology change and still uses
   R4 as next hop for traffic towards R5.  Now the routing loop occurs:



        +----+        +----+        +----+
        | R1 |--------| R2 |--------| R3 |
        +----+        +----+        +----+
         ^ |                           \
   Loop: | |    =+=+= obstacle =+=+     \
         | v                             \
        +----+                          +----+
        | R4 |                          | R5 |  R5 moved
        +----+                          +----+


                Figure 15: Transit during MANET convergence

   The loop is solved as soon as R1 is aware of the new topology.  Time
   for convergence is caused by routing protocol packet transfer, timers
   and processing time.  Protocol timers that slow down packet transfer
   or introduce jitter in SPF calculation increase convergence time and
   thus loop duration.  So jitter introduced by
   draft-clausen-manet-jitter emphasizes the routing loop problem.

   Defining solutions for this problem is out of scope of this document.
   A suggested approach is using a) path metrics based on cross layer
   metrics; b) implementing a reverse path check on the previous
   forwarder address, when this address is available and c) implementing
   a duplicate packet detection mechanism.

6.4.  Congested link avoidance

   In MANET environment, the shortest path mechanism can select a link
   connecting two MANET islands for relaying all traffic flows between
   these islands.  This is also the case when many exit routers to a
   high speed backbone are available.

   In wireless infrastructures, using bandwidth efficiently is a primary
   concern.  Advanced QoS mechanisms are needed, utilizing radio
   interface characteristics.  Call admission control mechanisms like
   RSVP should be considered, especially for real-time traffic.

   Attention is required for bridging layer-2 devices, where the router
   and the layer-2 device are linked with a high speed interface.  Flow
   control and layer-2 metric transfer between router and the layer-2
   device as described in "PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE) Extensions for
   Credit Flow and Link Metrics" [33] can solve introduced problems.

   Also attention is required for an ad-hoc dense crowd of nodes
   requiring lots of bandwidth.  In such a scenario, available
   transmission means will be overloaded.

6.5.  MANET and NEMO at home problem

   In MIP, a Mobile Node is at home when it is connected to the Home
   Link.  For wireless nodes in the home region, a MANET protocol could
   be used for extending the home link, using the HA as exit router.

   This introduces a problem, the node could be classified as "at home"
   because it can reach any CN using the MANET and its own HA as exit
   router, but it is also "far form home" because it is not on the home
   link, in the meaning that it does not receive HA RA with the Home
   Agent Information Option.

                Figure 18: MANET and NEMO at home detection

   MR1 receives the HA RA with HAIO, thus MR1 is at home.  MR2 is not
   receiving the HAIO and is thus far from home.  But MR2 is able to
   communicate with the fixed infrastructure using MANET routing and the
   HA acting as MANET Border Router.

   Another problem is introduced when the MANET protocol is used on the
   NEMO tunnel.  This introduces a routing shortcut, the native MANET
   route is in parallel with the MANET route via the NEMO tunnel.  The
   next hop to the HA and thus to the NEMO tunnel endpoint could be
   learned through the tunnel, this introduces tunnel interface
   instability.

6.6.  MANET scale to infinity problem when peering to strangers

   In a dense deployment of MANET routers, all configured for roaming in
   a large area and peering to all other routers, the MANET will melt
   down due to flooding topology information from any to all.  A sample
   scenario is car to car communication in a metropolis with say a
   million cars.  Current IETF MANET protocols provide a flat routing
   domain, where reachability is provided between ALL MANET routers.

   In a chain of MANET routers, where each router has two neighbors (or
   one neighbor on the end routers), there is no problem with neighbor
   discovery or 2-hop neighbor state maintenance.  But prefix flooding
   (proactive routing) or route requests (reactive routing) are flooded
   over all routers in the MANET.

   This problem occurs independent of the existence of a fixed backbone
   infrastructure.

   Some would suggest MANETs can be designed for using hierarchy.
   Current IETF MANET protocols do not support such.  Others would
   suggest automatic hierarchy can be added in future extensions on the
   basic protocol.  There is no evidence that options for such are
   realistic.
