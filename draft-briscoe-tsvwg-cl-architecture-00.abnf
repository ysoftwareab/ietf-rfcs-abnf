Probability-CE-codepoint-set = 0    

Probability-CE-codepoint-set = 1    

Probability-CE-codepoint-set = (CL-bucket-level - min-threshold) / 
A = 0 for the fixed bandwidth case (ie Section 2.1),  

A = 1 for the flexible bandwidth case (ie Section 2.2). 

    

B = 0 if the CL packet does not have its CE codepoint set  

B = 1 if the CL packet has its CE codepoint set
