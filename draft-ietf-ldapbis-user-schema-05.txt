Abstract

   This document is a integral part of the LDAP technical specification 
   [ROADMAP].  It provides an overview of attribute types and object 
   classes intended for use by LDAP directory clients for many 
   directory services, such as, White Pages.  Originally specified the 
   ISO/IEC 9594 and X.500 documents, these objects are widely used as a 
   basis for the schema in many LDAP directories.  This document does 
   not cover attributes used for the administration of directory 
   servers, nor does it include directory objects defined for specific 
   uses in other documents.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides an overview of attribute types and object 
   classes intended for use by LDAP directory clients for many 
   directory services, such as, White Pages.  Originally specified in 
   the ISO/IEC 9594 and X.500 documents, these objects are widely used 
   as a basis for the schema in many LDAP directories.  This document 
   does not cover attributes used for the administration of directory 
   servers, nor does it include directory objects defined for specific 
   uses in other documents.

1.1  Situation

   This document is a integral part of the LDAP technical specification 
   [ROADMAP] which obsoletes the previously defined LDAP technical 
   specification [RFC3377] in its entirety.  In terms of RFC 2256, 
   Sections 6 and 8 of RFC 2256 are obsoleted by [Syntaxes].  
   Sections 5.1, 5.2, 7.1 and 7.2 of RFC 2256 are obsoleted by [Models].
   The remainder of RFC 2256 is obsoleted by this document.  Sections 
   3.4 and 4.4 of this document supercede the technical specifications 
   for the 'dc' attribute type and 'domain' object class found in 
   RFC 2247.  The remainder of RFC 2247 remains in force.

   A number of schema elements which were included in the previous 
   revision of the LDAP Technical Specification are not included in this
   revision of LDAP.  PKI-related schema elements are now specified in 
   [LDAP-PKI].  Unless reintroduced in future technical specifications, 
   the remainder are to be considered Historic.

1.2  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3  General Issues

   This document references Syntaxes given in Section 3 of [Syntaxes] 
   and Matching Rules specified in Section 4 of [Syntaxes].

   The definitions of Attribute Types and Object Classes are written 
   using the ABNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and 
   ObjectClassDescription given in [Models].  Lines have been folded 
   for readability.

1.4  Source

   The schema definitions in this document are based on those found in 
   the X.500-series [X.520] and [X.521] and RFC 2247 [RFC2247], 
   specifically:

        Sections             Source
        ============         ==================
        2.1 - 2.3            X.520 [X.520]
        2.4                  RFC 2247 [RFC2247]
        2.5 - 2.42           X.520 [X.520]
        3.1  - 3.3           X.521 [X.521]
        3.4                  RFC 2247 [RFC2247]
        3.5 - 3.13           X.521 [X.521]


2. Attribute Types

   The Attribute Types contained in this section hold user information.

   There is no requirement that servers implement the following 
   Attribute Types: 

       searchGuide
       teletexTerminalIdentifier

   In fact, their use is greatly discouraged.

   An LDAP server implementation SHOULD recognize the rest of the 
   Attribute Types described in this section.

2.1  businessCategory

   This Attribute Type describes the kind of business performed by 
   an organization.

   ( 2.5.4.15 NAME 'businessCategory' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{128} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Directory String syntax.

2.2  c

   This is the X.520 [X.520] countryName Attribute Type, which contains 
   a two-letter ISO 3166 [ISO3166]country code.

   ( 2.5.4.6 NAME 'c' 
      SUP name 
      SINGLE-VALUE )

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-05          April 2003


2.3  cn

   This is the X.520 [X.520] commonName Attribute Type, which contains 
   a name of an object.  If the object corresponds to a person, it is 
   typically the person's full name.

   ( 2.5.4.3 NAME 'cn' 
      SUP name )

2.4  dc

   The dc (short for domainComponent) attribute type is defined as 
   follows:

   ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.25 NAME 'dc' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 
      SINGLE-VALUE )

   The value of this attribute is a string holding one component of a 
   DNS domain name.  The encoding of IA5String for use in LDAP is simply
   the characters of the string itself.  The equality matching rule is 
   case insensitive, as is today's DNS.

2.5  description

   This Attribute Type contains a human-readable description of 
   the object. 

   ( 2.5.4.13 NAME 'description' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{1024} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Directory String syntax.

2.6  destinationIndicator

   This attribute is used for the telegram service.

   ( 2.5.4.27 NAME 'destinationIndicator' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44{128} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Printable String syntax.

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-05          April 2003


2.7  distinguishedName

   This Attribute Type is not used as the name of the object itself, 
   but it is instead a base type from which attributes with DN syntax 
   inherit.

   It is unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an 
   entry.  LDAP server implementations which do not support attribute 
   subtyping need not recognize this attribute in requests.  Client 
   implementations MUST NOT assume that LDAP servers are capable of 
   performing attribute subtyping.

   ( 2.5.4.49 NAME 'distinguishedName' 
      EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 )

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the DN syntax.

2.8  dnQualifier

   The dnQualifier Attribute Type specifies disambiguating information

5.  Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive 
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws 
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the 
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

   It is required that strong authentication be performed in order to 
   modify directory entries using LDAP.


6.  Acknowledgements

   The definitions, on which this document is based, have been developed
   by committees for telecommunications and international standards.  
   No new attribute definitions have been added.  

   This document is an update of RFC 2256 by Mark Wahl.  RFC 2256 was a
   product of the IETF ASID Working Group.

   This document is based upon input of the IETF LDAPBIS working group.
   The author wishes to thank S. Legg and K. Zeilenga for their 
   significant contribution to this update.

                          Appendix A  Changes RFC 2256

   This appendix lists the changes that have been made from RFC 2256 to 
   this I-D.  

      1.  Revised the Status of this Memo.

      2.  Removed the IESG Note.

      3.  Dependencies on RFC 1274 have been eliminated.

      4.  Added a Security Considerations section, requiring strong 
          authentication in order to modify directory entries.

      5.  Deleted the conformance requirement for subschema object 
          classes in favor of a statement in [Syntaxes].

      6.  Added a Table of Contents.

      7.  Added explanations to many attributes.

      8.  Removed Section 4, Syntaxes, and Section 6, Matching Rules, 
          (moved to [Syntaxes]).

      9.  Reordered Section 3, Attributes, and Section 4, Object 
          Classes, alphabetically.

      10. Added an explanation for each object class.

      11. Removed the certificate-related Attribute Types:  
             authorityRevocationList, 
             cACertificate, 
             certificateRevocationList, 
             crossCertificatePair, 
             deltaRevocationList, 
             supportedAlgorithms, and 
             userCertificate.

          because they are not in the version of X.500 which 
          is referenced.
