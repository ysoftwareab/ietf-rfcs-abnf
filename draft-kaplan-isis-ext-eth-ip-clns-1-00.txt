1. Status of this Memo

	This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with 
	all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

	Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
	Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that
	other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
	Drafts.

	Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months 
	and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
	time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
	material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

2. Abstract

	This document presents an extension to the current Ethernet Frame 
	standards to support payloads greater than 1500 Bytes for IP and 
	ISO CLNS. This is useful for Gigabit Ethernet technology, providing
        a means to carry large MTU packets without fragmentation over a
	high-speed broadcast network.

3. Overview

	There are two fundamental frame types defined for Ethernet:
	Ethernet II [ETH] [RFC894] and 802.3 [IEEE802.3]. 802.3 headers
	may be followed by a Logical Link Control header,
	802.2 [IEEE802.2]. Both types of encapsulations can co-exist on
	the same media at the same time. Encodings for Ethernet II and 802.3
	frames evolved such that, as long payloads were less than 1500
	bytes, Ethernet II frames could always be distinguished from
	IEEE 802.3 frames.

	However, when the payload is greater than 1500 bytes frames may 
        not be uniquely distinguishable as conforming to Ethernet II or 
        802.3 formats. This document extends the Ethernet frame format 
	to allow frames with IP or CLNS payloads larger than 1500 bytes 
        to be uniquely distinguished.

4. Ethernet Frame Formats

	A. Ethernet II
		
		+----+----+------+------+-----+
		| DA | SA | Type | Data | FCS |
		+----+----+------+------+-----+
	  
		DA      Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)
		SA      Source MAC Address      (6 bytes)
		Type    Protocol Type           (2 bytes)
		Data    Protocol Data           (46 - 1500 bytes)
		FCS     Frame Checksum          (4 bytes)

	B. IEEE 802.3 and derivatives

		+----+----+------+------+-----+
		| DA | SA | Len  | Data | FCS |
		+----+----+------+------+-----+

		DA      Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)
		SA      Source MAC Address      (6 bytes)
		Len     Length of Data field    (2 bytes)
		Data    Protocol Data           (46 - 1500 bytes)
		FCS     Frame Checksum          (4 bytes)
	  
	The derivatives include LLC (802.2) and SNAP which prefix the
	data field with an LLC header.  In these instances the Len field
	then corresponds to the combined size of both the data portion
	of the frame and the LLC header.
	
	On reception, the two formats are differentiated based on the
	magnitude of the Type/Length field, as follows:

	> 1500 bytes:   value corresponds to a type field.  The frame is an
			Ethernet II frame, with type values starting
			at 1536 (600 hex).

	<= 1500 bytes:  value corresponds to a length field.  The frame is
			an IEEE 802.3 format (or derivative) with a maximum
			data length of 1500 bytes.


5. Problem with Large CLNS Frames in the presence of IP Frames

	Some ISO protocols commonly used in the Internet, such as ESIS
	and ISIS are carried as CLNS packets. There is no reserved
        Ethertype for CLNS.  CLNS packets can only use the 
        IEEE 802.3/802.2 encoding, and so are limited in length to
        1500 bytes.
	
 	IP packets are encapsulated within Ethernet II frames, which do 
        not have length fields, and so IP packets are not limited in 
   	length to 1500 bytes by framing.

6. Proposed Ethernet Frame Extension

	Large CLNS frames may be supported by the following:
	
	+  Define an Ethertype, 0x8872, for CLNS and encoding these frames as
	   802.2 within Ethernet II:
	   
		+----+----+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
		| DA | SA | Type | DSAP | SSAP | Ctrl | Data | FCS |
		+----+----+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
				  === 802.2 Header ===

		DA      Destination MAC Address                 (6 bytes)
		SA      Source MAC Address                      (6 bytes)
		Type    Ethertype for CLNS                      (2 bytes)
		DSAP    802.2 Destination Service Access Point  (1 byte)
		SSAP    802.2 Source Service Access Point       (1 byte)
		Ctrl    802.2 Control Field                     (1 byte)
		Data    Protocol Data                           ( > 46 bytes)
		FCS     Frame Checksum                          (4 bytes)
	  
	+  Allow Ethernet II frames to have payloads greater than 1500 bytes.

	There is no loss of information from CLNS packets encapsulated 
	as 802.3/802.2 because although the 802.3 length field is missing, 
	the frame length is known by virtue of the frame being accepted 
	by the network interface.

	In this manner, all Ethernet II packets, including IP and CLNS,
	can be larger than 1500 bytes, yet are uniquely identified.
