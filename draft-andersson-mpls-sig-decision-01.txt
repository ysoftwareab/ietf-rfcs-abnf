1. Introduction

1.1 Objectives of document

This document documents the Working group consensus on continuing to
develop RFC3209 [RFC3209] as the signalling protocol MPLS signaling for
Traffic Engineering application.

This document also documents the MPLS working group consensus on not
undertaking any further work on the RFC3212 [RFC3212], e.g. there is no
plans to progress RFC 3212 beyond proposed standard. No other actions
are taken relative the document status of RFC3212 [RFC3212] or RFCs that
specifies extensions to RFC3212.

1.2 Nomenclature

This document uses the term "CR-LDP related working group drafts" to
discuss a group of Internet Drafts that has specifies changes or
extensions to [RFC3212] and the term "CR-LDP related RFCs" to discuss
the group of RFCs that specifies protocol and applicability of
[RFC3212].

   The CR-LDP related drafts are:
      draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-query-nn.txt [QUERY]
      draft-ietf-mpls-te-feed-nn.txt [FEED]
      draft-ietf-mpls-crldp-unnum-nn.txt [UNNUM]
      draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ft-nn.txt [FT]
      draft-ietf-mpls-generalized-cr-ldp-nn.txt [GEN]
      draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-nn.txt [SONET]
      draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g709-nn.txt [G709]
      draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-extensions-nn.txt [SDH]

The ¡nn in the filename indicates that this does not only apply to the
current version of the document, but to future version as well.

CR-LDP related RFCs

    The CR-LDP related RFCs are:
      RFC3212, "Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP"
      RFC3213, "Applicability Statement for CR-LDP"
      RFC3214, "LSP Modification Using CR-LDP"

No further updates of the CR-LDP related RFCs, beyond proposed standard
are planned.


2. Background

Very early (1997) in the MPLS standardization it was clear that a
protocol would be needed that would enable providers to setup LSPs that
took other information (e.g. various QoS parameters) as input for
establishing LSPs. Development of this type of signalling protocol took
two different tracks:

  - extensions to RSVP for setting up MPLS tunnels [RFC3209]

  - extensions to LDP for setting constraint based LSPs [RFC3212]

The motivation for the choice of protocol was in both cases
straightforward. Extending RSVP-TE to do in an MPLS environment what it
already was doing (handling QoS information and reserving resources) in
an IP environment is comprehensible; you only have to add the label


INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-andersson-mpls-sig-decision-01.txt        18.09.02

distribution capability. Extending a native MPLS protocol like LDP,
which was designed to do label distribution, to handle some extra TLVs
with QoS information is also not revolutionary.

The MPLS group never reached a consensus on which way to go. Both
protocols were progressed to proposed standard.


3. CCAMP implementation study

An implementation survey for signaling protocols within the GMPLS area
were published in June 2002 [GMPLS]. The survey did show that there are
quite a number of implementations; the survey includes responses from 22
different implementers. The survey also did show that of the 22
responders 21 had implemented the GMPLS signalling based on [RFC3209],
while only 3 had implemented based on [RFC3212].


4. MPLS Working Group discussion

4.1 Phase 1

The report prompted questions if it was motivated to have two different
protocols for the same things. The discussion was brought to the MPLS
Working Group at the meeting in Yokohama July 2002. After discussion at
the meeting it was decided to "bring this to the list" and also invite
comments from the other Sub-IP Area Working Groups.

The question sent to the list was formulated as:

"As there are issues with having two similar standards (potentially
diverging), and it generates duplicate work in several IETF working
groups, the question was asked whether we should make CR-LDP
informational (which still make it available and possible to work with)
and progress only RSVP-TE on the standards track."

The response to this was largely positive, but some problems were
immediately pointed out:

  - there are non-IETF standards which reference RFC3212. Taking CR-LDP
     off the standards track would cause un-necessary problems for those
     organisations and should be done only after co-ordinating with
     those organizations

  - there is, e.g. in RFC2026 [RFC2026], no documented process
     according to which a document on the standards track may be move to
     a status that is non-standards track



INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-andersson-mpls-sig-decision-01.txt         18.09.02



Andersson                   Expires March 2003                  [Page 5]

Each of these arguments is by themselves strong and would have led to
some reformulation of the proposal to move CR-LDP to informational.
Moreover, in combination it was clear that the original proposal was not
viable.

On the other hand the support for actually keeping CR-LDP as alive an
IETF alternative to RSVP-TE is extremely small.

4.2 IETF process

The current IETF process for managing changes in RFC status does not
include any information on how to move an existing standard track RFC to
a non-standard track status. It has been show that such actions have
been previously taken e.g. RFCs 2673 and 2874 were moved from Proposed
Standard to Experimental. Though the cases are not exactly parallel to
the MPLS signalling case it shows that the IESG are prepared to take
such decisions given that the arguments are sufficiently strong.

4.3 Relationship to other standards organizations

The relationship with other standard organizations is a corner stone in
the IETF work. We are dependent on their work and they need us; each has
their own area of expertise. It is therefore necessary that both sides
handle their standards documentation in such a way that no unnecessary
updates or revisions are introduced simply by sloppy handling of
documents.

Consequently we need to keep CR-LDP referenceable, i.e. on the standards
track, for the foreseeable future. The implication of this is not that
we need to progress it further, or need to undertake further work in the
area. One implication however is that standards organizations which
reference the document, need to be notified of our decision so that they
(at their own leisure) can change their references to more appropriate
documents. It is also expected that they notify us when they no longer
have normative references to CR-LDP.

4.4 Phase 2

Based on the feed back from this first discussion the question to the
working group were reformulated as:

"Should the MPLS WG focus its efforts on a signaling protocol
for traffic engineering applications on RSVP-TE, and hence the WG effort
with CR-LDP be discontinued? This would not involve any change in
document status for CR-LDP, nor would it hinder continued
individual contributions in the CR-LDP space. It would involve
a change in the MPLS WG charter to reflect this."



INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-andersson-mpls-sig-decision-01.txt        18.09.02



Andersson                  Expires March 2003                  [Page 6]

It was pointed out that "nor would it hinder continued individual
contributions" is too weak. We actually discourage, while it is not
prohibited, continued work in the CR-LDP area. That is the whole point
with taking this decision.

It was also pointed out that while it is quite acceptable to not accept
further working group documents, it would also be appropriate to take
the existing CR-LDP related working group documents through the process
to proposed standard or informational as intended. This is applicable to
the following documents, since much of the work has already been
completed on them:


  -in MPLS WG
    -- draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-query-nn.txt
       draft-ietf-mpls-te-feed-nn.txt
       draft-ietf-mpls-crldp-unnum-nn.txt
       draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ft-nn.txt

  - in CCAMP WG
    -- draft-ietf-mpls-generalized-cr-ldp-nn.txt
       draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-nn.txt
       draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g709-01.txt
       draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-extensions-nn.txt

Some of the documents listed above are not in themselves be extensions
to CR-LDP, but in one way or another are deemed to be "equally
applicable to CR-LDP". For those documents it will be fully appropriate
to progress them to beyond proposed standard in the future.

RFCs that are extensions to CR-LDP, i.e. RFCs 3213 and 3214 will remain
proposed standard documents.

After this a good consensus quickly formed along those lines. Close to
90% of the people participating discussion said that they support or at
least accept this outcome of the working group discussion.


5. MPLS Working Group consensus



In a message to the working group (date) the working groups chairs found
that consensus had been reached on:

  - that the MPLS WG needs to focus its efforts on RSVP-TE (RFC 3209)
    as protocol for traffic engineering signalling.




INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-andersson-mpls-sig-decision-01.txt        18.09.02



Andersson                    Expires March 2003                  [Page 7]

  - that the Working Group effort on CR-LDP should be discontinued.

  - that the WG charter should be updated to reflect this.

  - that CR-LDP (RFC 3212) will remain a proposed standard.

  - that RFCs 3213 and 3214, that is closely related to CR-LDP will
    remain proposed standard.

  - that existing Working Group drafts related to or updating/changing
    CR-LDP will be progressed through the standards process to
    proposed standard or informational RFCs as appropriate.

  - that "the existing cr-ldp working group documents" are:
             draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-query-nn.txt
             draft-ietf-mpls-te-feed-nn.txt
             draft-ietf-mpls-crldp-unnum-nn.txt
             draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ft-nn.txt
             draft-ietf-mpls-generalized-cr-ldp-nn.txt
             draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-nn.txt
             draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g709-nn.txt
             draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-extensions-nn.txt

  - that the IETF will take on no new Working Group documents related
    to CR-LDP.

  - that the IETF will entertain no efforts to promote CR-LDP beyond
    proposed standard.

  - that individual contributions to CR-LDP area are not prohibited,
    but discouraged.

  - that a message will be sent to the relevant standards organizations
    notifying them of this change of focus on MPLS signaling protocols.


6. Recommendation to the IESG

Based on the consensus in the MPLS working group we recommend the IESG
to:

  - confirm the MPLS Working Group decision to discontinue work on CR-
    LDP and focus on RSVP-TE as signaling protocol for traffic
    engineering applications for MPLS

  - refrain from entertaining work that intends to progress RFC-3212 or
    related RFCs beyond proposed standard

Andersson                  Expires March 2003                  [Page 8]

  - review the IETF process with respect to management of documents
    that needs to be moved from standards track to any other status

  - publish this document as Informational RFC


7. Security considerations

This document only discusses a refocusing of the MPLS Working Group work
and consequently brings no new security considerations.


8. IANA considerations

This document brings no IANA considerations.
