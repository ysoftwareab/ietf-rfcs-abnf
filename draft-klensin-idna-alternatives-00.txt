Abstract

   The Internet protocol for internationalized domain names (IDNs) is
   documented in RFC 3490 and associated documents and commonly known as
   IDNA.  While that protocol was being developed (and more recently),
   there were a number of alternate proposals and suggestions for
   different ways to do IDNs.  IDNA was favored over those alternatives,
   but variations on them seem to keep reappearing with the suggestion
   that they are novel ideas.  This memo describes some of those
   suggested alternatives and summarizes the reasons why they were not

Internet-Draft              IDNA Alternatives              February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Internet protocol for internationalized domain names (IDNs) is
   documented in RFC 3490 [RFC3490] and associated documents[RFC3491]
   [RFC3492] [RFC3454] and commonly known as IDNA (Internationalizing
   Domain Names in Applications).  While that protocol was being
   developed (and more recently), there were a number of alternate
   proposals and suggestions for different ways to do IDNs.  IDNA was
   favored over those alternatives, but variations on them seem to keep
   reappearing with the suggestion that they are novel ideas.  This memo
   describes some of those suggested alternatives and summarizes the
   reasons why they were not favored over IDNA.

   Section 4.1Section 4.3

   While this document may be relevant to the discussion of IDNA
   revisions and updates, it is not expected to become the product of
   any IETF WG or other formal effort.

   This document assumes a reasonable understanding of the terminology
   used to describe IDNA.  That terminology appears, in slightly
   different forms, in [RFC3490], [RFC4690], and [IDNA200X-Rationale].

   The sections that immediately follow supply some general information
   and concepts that are key to putting the proposals that follow into
   an appropriate context.  Then, Section 4 discusses each of the
   alternative in turn.


2.  The Key IDNA Decision

   The key decision underlying IDNA was that implementation and
   deployment of IDNs should not require any changes to the DNS itself.
   Consequently, the basic DNS matching algorithm (case-insensitive
   mapping for ASCII characters, undefined mapping for most other
   strings) was to be unchanged and any characters in ordinary labels
   would have to by in ASCII and conform to the "hostname" (letter-
   digit-hyphen or LDH) rules.  This decision was made for two reasons.
   The first was to reduce the risk of IDNs "breaking" the DNS,
   presumably to zero.  The second was to permit faster deployment of
   IDNs and deployment on an application-by-applications basis, rather
   than requiring, in its most extreme form, a synchronized change
   across the Internet.  While they differ by degree and most raise
   other problems, virtually all of the suggestions identified below
   would have required disruptive changes to the DNS of one sort or
   another.  Consequently, once the "no DNS changes" decision was made,
   the vast majority of them were not seriously considered further.

4.  Other Suggestions for IDNs

   This section contains a list of suggestions for the support of IDNs
   other than the IDNA protocol that eventually emerged.  The
   alternatives do not appear in any particular order.  Each subsection
   describing an alternative contains a description of that alternative,
   a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages, and a description
   of why IDNA was favored over it.

4.1.  An Alternate DNS Class

4.1.1.  Description

   The DNS supports a concept of "Class", essentially a separate DNS
   tree with the potential for some changed resolution rules.  Classes
   have not been heavily used; the familiar DNS operates entirely in
   terms of "Class=IN" (for "Internet").  This proposal was built on the
   assumption that any IDN approach that attempted to accommodate non-
   ASCII strings by encoding them into ASCII would ultimately turn out
   to be problematic.  Hence, it represented an attempt to move away
   from the "ASCII DNS" toward a fully international DNS, rather than
   patching non-ASCII characters onto the ASCII base.

   The general idea was to define a completely new Class, with non-ACII
   characters and operations on them fully defined, and migrate to it
   and away from Class=IN.  As a server-based approach, it would support
   server-side matching and preservation of presentation distinctions.

   The suggestion was discussed in a long-expired Internet
   Draft[IDN-NewClass].

4.1.2.  Advantages

   The obvious advantage claimed for this proposal was that it would
   result in a fully-internationalized DNS, not one that was oriented
   toward ASCII but that had add-on support for other characters.

4.1.3.  Drawbacks

   A new DNS Class would presumably take much longer to deploy, even
   with backward-compatibility mechanisms, than an application-only
   approach such as IDNA.  In addition, while it was not so obvious when
   the Internet-Draft was written, it now seems clear that there is no

Internet-Draft              IDNA Alternatives              February 2008


   such thing as a solution that is completely server-side in the same
   way that the IDNA approach is completely client-side.  The client
   would still presumably have to provide some normalization and
   preprocessing.  The server-side decisions about what to match and
   what to treat as distinct would probably also be very complex and
   controversial.

4.1.4.  Key Reasons for Rejection

   This proposal was rejected by the IDN Working Group because it would
   have involved much more complex and time-consuming deployment
   problems than IDNA.

4.3.  TLD-Dependent Matching

4.3.1.  Description

   There have been many proposals, most of them since RFC 3490 was
   published, to somehow condition the content, presentation, or
   matching rules for particular labels based in the particular top-
   level domain --presumably tied to a language-- in which the label was
   found.  It is not believed that any of these suggestions have been
   written up in enough detail to permit a careful and critical
   evaluation of it, so the comments below apply more to this general
   class of proposals rather than to any particular one.

4.3.2.  Advantages

   For some scripts, Unicode requires (or is believed by some language
   authorities to require) language-dependent rendering or matching

   rules.  Some characters are essential to representation of the
   orthography of some languages in Unicode but are meaningless or
   dangerous in strings consisting of characters associated with other
   languages.  If one could somehow identify the language associated
   with a particular label by examining its relationship to the DNS tree
   in which it were located, one could apply language-specific (rather
   than merely script-specific or context-dependent) rules to the
   interpretation and registration of labels.

4.3.3.  Drawbacks

   This set of ideas are not feasible without very significant changes
   to the DNS.  Not only are there difficulties in considering a label
   only the context of the fully-qualified name of which it is part, but
   complex questions arise about the practicality of rules of these
   types in the DNS administrative hierarchy in practice.  The
   introduction of the DNAME RR introduces an additional complication,
   since a system examining a given label cannot know the tree from
   which it will be referenced.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document provides a historical perspective, not a protocol
   specification.  It involves no actions for IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   While comments about some of the relative security implications and
   risks of different alternatives appear above, this document contains
   a historical perspective, not a protocol specification or proposal,
   and consequently has no security implications for the Internet other
   than, perhaps, the benefit of explaining why some alternatives should
   not be further considered or even introduced locally.
