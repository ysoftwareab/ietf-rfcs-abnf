  Abstract 
   
  As the group communication become more important, the special label 
  should be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. 
  The allocation mechanism of a group label can be applied to a point-
  to-multipoint(P2MP) communication in MPLS networks. Currently used 
  label is locally significant, while this group label should be common 
  object within a single MPLS domain. 
  This document presents a set of requirements for multicast service 
  using a group label over Multiprotocol Label Switching(MPLS). It 
  identifies functional and performance capabilities required to 
  allocate a group label in master-slave network and peer to peer 
  network, which facilitates efficient and reliable group communication 
  and Quality of Service(QoS) in MPLS domain. It also identifies 
  functional capabilities required to implement several services 
  related to Content Distribution Network(CDN) in master-slave network.

  0.1  this document 
   
  We propose a group label which is globally unique within a single 
  MPLS domain and then provide multicast service using a group label. 
  At first, this document presents a set of requirement for multicast 
  service using a group label over MPLS and then identifies allocation 
  mechanism of a group label to perform unidirectional point to 
  multipoint(P2MP) connection. The research for the bidirectional P2MP 
  communication remains in the future.

  This document presents a set of requirement for P2MP capability 
  extension to Multiprotocol Label Switching(MPLS). The functional and 
  performance extensions about Content Distribution Network(CDN) and 
  CDN/VoIP/VPN service convergence network are described. 
   
  0.3  differences 
   
  Our draft considers multicast service using a group label in two 
  kinds of network. One is master-slave network. The other is peer to 
  peer network. Requirements, allocation mechanism of a group label and 
  service type can be dealt with each network topology. 
  On the other hand, yasukawa's draft refers to a set of CDN service 
  and other service convergence network. Then, P2MP extensions which 
  are required to these services are identified.

Requirements for multicast service using a group label  
over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
   
1. Introduction 
   
  It is increasingly important to guarantee real-time application 
  requiring more strict QoS and higher bandwidth such as Internet 
  broadcasting, video conferencing and real-time delivery services, 
  therefore the group communication will become very useful for these 
  purposes. The special label should be allocated in support of group 
  management and maintenance. The allocation mechanism of group label 
  can be applied to a point to multipoint(P2MP) communication. 
   
  In existing MPLS technology, label switching is done so that fast and 
  simple forwarding can be performed and this label is local 
  significant. 
  In order to facilitate group communication, a group label which is 
  globally unique within a single MPLS domain should be supported. This 
  label can distinguish each P2MP LSP when a edge node joins several 
  P2MP connections. 
   
  This multicast service using a group label can be applied Layer 2 
  Virtual Private Network(L2VPN). The group label is the same role as 
  VPN ID. Therefore, a single VPN can be communicated with other VPNs 
  within P2MP connection using a group label. 
  A group label is allocated using Resource Reservation Protocol-
  Traffic Engineering(RSVP-TE). Appropriate admission control should be 
  done according to requested QoS degree.  
  In case of multicast or broadcast traffic type, branch node should 
  perform replication function for path message and merging function 
  for resv message. 
  Using QoS mechanism such as Differentiated Service(DiffServ), we can 
  provide prioritized service. Billing mechanism also can be applied.  
   
  This document presents a set of requirements for multicast service 
  using a group label over Multiprotocol Label Switching(MPLS). It 
  identifies functional and performance capabilities required to 
  allocate a group label in master-slave network and peer to peer 
  network, which facilitates efficient and reliable group communication 
  and Quality of Service(QoS)in MPLS domain. It also identifies 
  functional capabilities required to implement several services 
  related to Content Distribution Network(CDN) in master-slave based 
  network. This document includes the allocation mechanism of a group 
  label in order to perform unidirectional P2MP communication. 
   
2. Definition 
   
2.1 Group Label 
   
  A group label is a common object to establish and maintain the P2MP 
  connection and globally unique within a single MPLS domain.

Requirements for multicast service using a group label  
over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
  The allocation mechanism of a group label is done in two kinds of 
  network using RSVP-TE signaling protocol. One is server-client based 
  network and the other is peer to peer based network. 
   
2.2 Group Communication based on Client-Server Model 
   
  A single Server is equipped with the concept of multipoint control 
  unit (MCU) which can enable two or more receivers to intercommunicate 
  with a single sender like conferencing. So, the P2MP connection can 
  be established using a single server locally. This server has two 
  functions; one is a replication function for Path message with group 
  label request object and the other is a merging function for Resv 
  message with group label.  
   
  It is totally reliable and robust to establish this communication 
  because a server manages the traffic engineered explicit routes to 
  avoid link failure before forwarding a Path message from a sender. 
   
2.3 Group Communication based on Peer Model 
   
  This model doesn∆t need any server and hello message for group 
  management because a LSR which wants to establish P2MP connection can 
  directly send Path message containing group label request to all of 
  the LSRs within a MPLS domain. A LSR which sends Path message doesn∆t 
  know who will receive. All of the LSRs which received Path message 
  determine whether to join a P2MP connection. If they accept the 
  request, they send Resv message with group label. Otherwise, they 
  ignore the request. After receiving Resv messages from LSRs, the P2MP 
  connection between a single sender and multiple receivers can be 
  established within a MPLS domain. The common group label should be 
  used in this communication.  
   
  In peer model, there are much smaller overhead for messages and 
  maintaining a server with a huge database. On the other hand, the 
  failing possibility to establish a P2MP connection is much higher 
  than the client-server model, since a server which chooses traffic 
  engineered explicit route between a sender and receivers doesn∆t 
  exist. 
   
3. Requirements for Multicast Service using a Group Label  
 
3.1 Master-Slave Network 
 
3.1.1 Group Label distribution 
 
  Using RSVP-TE signaling protocol for allocating a group label, 
  messages of RSVP-TE can be distributed differently according to the 
  incoming traffic type toward master. In case of unicast traffic, Path 
  message is distributed through the route so that a group label can be 
  assigned to each LSR of the route in point to point(P2P) connection. 
  In multicast or broadcast traffic, master should be capable of

Requirements for multicast service using a group label  
over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
  replicate Path message the same as the number of receiver. A master 
  also should have merging function to forward RSVP message from 
  multiple receivers toward a single sender. 
   
  P2MP connection has different dynamics compared with P2P connection 
  because the topology of receivers is changed frequently. A group 
  label is required to distinguish each P2MP connection 
   
  O Joining Mechanism 
   
  Master can have both all P2MP connection and corresponding group 
  label information. A receiver can dynamically request to join a 
  certain P2MP communication. If the joining request of new node is 
  traffic-negotiable, master assigns the group label which is exactly 
  matched to requested P2MP communication. Otherwise, that request must 
  be rejected. 
   
  Each master of the P2MP connection is required to check the residual 
  resource and traffic parameter such as delay, loss, etc. 
   
  O Leaving Mechanism 
   
  In case the already joined node wants to leave in the P2MP session 
  with the group label of certain QoS level, that node can request to 
  the master. Then, the explicit route of the receiver is torn down.  
   
  Since the process of joining or leaving is dynamically performed, a 
  master should periodically check the correct and updated information. 
   
3.1.2 Group Label Management 
   
  After establishing a P2MP connection, a common group label is 
  assigned to all the LSRs within the P2MP connection. A master should 
  have the topology information of established P2MP connection and 
  mapped group label information. Besides, whenever adding or removing 
  a leaf node, master should have correct updated information.  
   
  In customer's place, satisfactory service can be provided because of 
  distributing a group label in advance. Therefore, service 
  verification is easily done through group label management. 
   
3.1.3 Designing the position of master node  
   
  P2MP capability can largely improve the effective usage of network 
  resources such as bandwidth and link utilization. Therefore, the 
  calculation of master's location as a branch node is automatically or 
  administratively required to be done in order to place at optimal 
  position.  
   
  It also is required to use information related to underlying protocol 
  such as IGP traffic engineering extension or offline management tool.

over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
   
3.1.4 QoS Control for P2MP Communication using a Group Label 
   
  A common group label is assigned to each P2MP communication. The 
  group label is required to identify each P2MP connection as well as 
  control QoS level regarding bandwidth, delay, loss and other 
  performance parameters. 
   
  Therefore, QoS control by a group label should support QoS or Class 
  of Service(CoS) such as Expedited Forwarding(EF), Assured 
  Forwarding(AF) and Default(Best Effort) style of differentiated 
  service. 
   
3.1.5 Traffic Engineering for P2MP connection using a Group Label 
   
  Because of frequent changes of topology in joining or leaving leaf 
  nodes, traffic engineering including fault location detection and 
  fault recovery should be considered as a important function. In case 
  link failure occurs in P2MP connection using a group label, the 
  information related to failure is promptly advertised to a master and 
  rerouting function should be performed. At that time, rerouted 
  explicit route is done according to administrative policy. The most 
  important requirements on the rerouting process is to avoid traffic 
  disruption.  
   
  Therefore, the concept of make-before-break is strongly recommended. 
  This shares resources in the common part where both old P2MP and new 
  P2MP connection exist. After breaking down old P2MP connection,  
  the used traffic and resources is switched to new P2MP connection so 
  that rerouting can be successfully done. 
   
  In P2MP topology, a single common rerouting mechanism is required 
  because multiple paths can be rerouted at once. 
   
3.1.6 IPv4 / IPv6 support 
   
  This extension must support both IP4/IPv6 transmissions 
   
3.1.7 Interoperability between P2P and P2MP connection 
   
  According to incoming traffic type toward sender, a master should use 
  ether P2P or P2MP efficiently. It also should be supported that 
  multiple P2P connection are aggregated to establish P2MP. 
   
  In case a P2P connection is needed over already established P2MP 
  connection using a group label, group label space should be shared 
  between P2P and P2MP connection. Link resource is also required to be 
  shared between P2P and P2MP connection. 
   
3.1.8 Service Type

Requirements for multicast service using a group label  
over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
  We can classify P2MP service style of master-slave network 
  environment as a Content Distribution Service(CDS). The 
  representative services of CDS are Live Video Distribution, Video 
  Broadcasting, Video-on-Demand service, etc. These services have the 
  following features. First, they require much higher bandwidth. Second, 
  they should last longer session-on-time. Third, they are very 
  sensitive to delay.  
   
  O Live video Distribution 
   
  This service is to distribute live video streaming to multiple users 
  on demand basis. The sports real-time broadcasting or e-learning is a 
  delegate example of this service. 
   
  The basic operation is as follows. A streaming server per Provider 
  Edge(PE) node is located and video stream data is transmitted through 
  this server. Customers who are about to join or leave at certain 
  session need authentication at first and then are able to join or 
  leave using session control signaling. Therefore, P2MP connection 
  using a group label is dynamically created according to the location 
  of receivers. 
   
  Resource is also dynamically assigned according to receiver request. 
  When a session is established, a proper resource is assigned and when 
  the session is over, resource is released. Therefore, efficient and 
  effective resource management is required. 
   
  O Video Broadcasting Service 
   
  This service is to distribute streaming data to multiple users on 
  static connection basis. Digital broadcasting is a delegate example.  
   
  The basic operation is as follows. A broadcast streaming server is 
  located in center and provides services using multicast technology. A 
  static P2MP connection is established between a sender and multiple 
  receivers. Therefore, a single static P2MP connection can have 
  multicast capability. 
   
  In customer's place, customers can choose necessary video channel 
  from multiple service channels and then enjoy various service. That 
  is, the service environment which is equipped with high quality, 
  multiple channels and multiple functions can be realized. 
  In service provider's place, service providers can easily keep a 
  number of demands through high quality service of digital 
  broadcasting. Keeping extra frequency band through multiple channels 
  is important effect and multiple functions can improve revenue 
  potentially. 
   
  O Video on Demand Service

Requirements for multicast service using a group label  
over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
  This service is to distribute streaming service to a single receiver 
  on demand basis. 
   
  The basic operation is as follows. An original VoD streaming server 
  is located at center and provides services using unicast method. Then, 
  several mirror servers are located at near receivers. In case load 
  becomes significantly larger at central server, mirror server is 
  required in order to decentralize the load. 
   
  Therefore, multiple static P2P connections between a sender 
  accommodating central server and a receiver are established and also 
  between a sender accommodating mirror server and a receiver. 
   
  This concept decentralizes server load capable of providing services 
  so that QoS of video traffic can be guaranteed. A central server 
  checks remaining bandwidth of each P2P connection and enable new node 
  to join corresponding P2P communication according to requested QoS 
  whenever incoming requests. Therefore, connection failure can be 
  occurred frequently because multiple traffic streams can be entered 
  to a single P2P connection. 
   
  In order to improve transmission quality and reliable operation, fast 
  reroute mechanism is needed. 
   
3.2 Peer to Peer Network 
   
3.2.1 Group Label distribution 
 
  Using RSVP-TE signaling protocol for allocating a group label, All 
  nodes should distribute Path messages to every nodes within a single 
  MPLS domain. After receivers check whether requested QoS is 
  acceptable, receivers sends Resv message to only reasonable nodes. A 
  node becomes a sender and a receiver at the same time. Therefore, a 
  single MPLS network consists of P2MP connection using a group label 
  in a full mesh topology. 
  In order to process multicast or broadcast traffic, all nodes within 
  a single MPLS domain are required to perform replication and merging 
  function. 
  All P2MP connections should accommodate P2P as well as P2MP 
  communication according to customer request. 
   
  O Joining Mechanism 
   
  Since there is not any master in a P2MP connection, all nodes can 
  directly join at any time, however all nodes joining certain P2MP 
  communication should inform other group members. 
  Other group members can reject a new request according to residual 
  resource and traffic parameter such as delay, loss, etc. 
   
  O Leaving Mechanism

over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
  In case the already joined node wants to leave in the P2MP session 
  with the group label of certain QoS level, that node can notify other 
  group members and then immediately leave. Then, the explicit route of 
  the receiver is torn down.  
   
  Since all nodes can perform the process of joining or leaving for 
  themselves, each node should periodically check the correct and 
  updated information. 
   
3.2.2 Group Label Management 
   
  All nodes can manage only certain group label which they use. That is, 
  each node is required to have the information of group label which 
  belongs to itself. For example, the node which attends two kinds of 
  P2MP communication should manage two different group labels. 
 
3.2.3 Scalability 
   
  In this network, joining or leaving process is performed regardless 
  of the memory size of master. A node easily joins or leaves through 
  exchanging the information of a group label each other so that this 
  can be a scalable solution. 
   
  Since unlimited scalability can reduce QoS, appropriate policy is 
  required. 
   
4. Communication Mechanism for Multicast Service 
 
4.1 Procedures for setting up Unidirectional P2MP Communication 
   
  All of the LSRs within a single MPLS domain can be a sender or 
  receiver. If a sender node is designated, rest of them becomes 
  receivers. There exists a server per MPLS domain. The following is 
  the procedures of setting up unidirectional P2MP communication.  
   
  1. All of the LSRS within a single MPLS domain send hello message to 
     a server so that the server can register each IP address and 
     explicit route of each LSR to the NIB. The server has the NIB 
     including IP address and explicit route. So, the server maintains 
     the NIB due to periodical transmission of a hello message. 
   
  2. If a single LSR sends the Path message containing group label 
     request to a server, all of the LSRs except for a sender become 
     receivers within a MPLS domain. 
   
  3. After choosing explicit routes registered in NIB, the server 
     copies group label request as the number of chosen explicit route        
     and sends the Path message including group label request.  
   
  4. Among nodes receiving the Path message containing group label  
     requet, the node which is ready to accept the group label request

     label to the Resv message. 
   
  5. The server received several Resv messages containing group label    
     perform the merging function. Then, the server creates and sends  
     new Resv message containing group label to a sender. 
   
  6. After distributing the Resv message from multiple receiver to a  
     sender, the P2MP LSP is established and starts P2MP communication, 
     which a single sender and two  
     or more receivers are sharing the common group label.

Requirements for multicast service using a group label  
over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
  After establishing P2MP communication, the following mechanism is 
  applied when a new LSR intends to join this group. 
   
  - A new LSR sends a join message to a server. 
  - The server stores the information extracted from a Join message in 
    NIB and then forwards the join message to the sender. 
  - The sender received the join message sends a Path message 
    containing group label request to the server.  
  - The server received the Path message sends it to the new LSR if 
    being traffic-negotiable about explicit route. 
    Otherwise, the server sends notification message to the sender and 
    teardown message to the new LSR. 
  - The new LSR received the Path message sends Resv message to a 
    server.  
  - Then, the server forwards it to the sender and the new LSR can 
    join the P2MP communication. 
   
  The procedure of joining mechanism is illustrated in Figure 2.

4.3 Leaving Mechanism 
   
  Among LSRs joining the P2MP communication, the LSR which intends to 
  tear down the connection sends a leave message to a server. The 
  server sends a notification message to the sender and a teardown 
  message to the LSR which requests to leave.  
  The procedure of leaving mechanism is illustrated in Figure 3.

5.1 Required Message  
 
5.1.1 Path Message 
 
  In case a single LSR within a MPLS domain creates a Path message with 
  label request which requires allocating group label and sends to the 
  server, the rest of LSRS becomes receivers. The server sends Path 
  message along the explicit routes registered in NIB. The modified 
  message is shown in Figure 4. 
   
    <path Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 
                       <SESSION> <REVP-HOP> 
                       <TIME-VALUE>

5.1.2 Resv Message 
 
  LSRs received path message from server allocate a group label as a 
  part of Resv message and is sent through the server to the sender 
  along the reverse path of Path message. The modified format of Resv 
  message is as follows in Figure 5. 
   
    <Resv Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 
                       <SESSION> <RSVP-HOP>

Requirements for multicast service using a group label  
over MPLS                                                December 2003 
 
 
  The group label is recognized to all of the LSRs within P2MP label 
  switched path of a single MPLS domain. Since the path message 
  reserves the traffic engineered explicit registered in NIB, this 
  label may be carried by Resv message and forwarded to the reverse 
  explicit routes. 
  If a node handles the Resv message with the common group label object, 
  this node can join the P2MP communication. 
  The group label object has the following format: 
   
  LABEL class = 16, C-Type = 2 
   
  0                   1                   2                   3

5.2.3 Group Label Request Object 
 
  To establish a P2MP communication, the sender creates path message 
  with label request object for group label allocation. This label 
  request object specifies the range of group label and triggers the 
  nodes registered in NIB to allocate a group label and to place the 
  group label of Resv message. The group label must be allocated from 
  that range. The group label request object is shown in Figure 8. 
   
  class = 19, C-Type = 4

6. Other Issues 
   
  This document specifies that only sender creates the group label 
  request object and sends the Path message with group label request. 
  The rest of LSRs within a single MPLS domain becomes receiver, 
  therefore, it is possible to perform unidirectional P2MP 
  communication. The research for bidirectional P2MP communication 
  remains in the future, which two or more LSRs not only receive Path 
  message from a single node but also create and send Path message to a 
  single node.  
   
Security Considerations 
   
  This document does not have any security concerns. The security 
  requirements using this document are described in the referenced 
  documents.
