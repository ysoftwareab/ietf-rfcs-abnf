Abstract

   The objective of this document is to specify the Best Current
   Practice (BCP) adopted by a SSP or other organization providing
   multimedia communication services such as Voice over Internet
   Protocol(VoIP) in order to locate another SSP to peer with in the
   context of Session PEERing for Multimedia INTerconnect.  This
   document attempts to fill the gaps in information from RFC 3261, RFC
   3263, and other documents, in order to more assist SSPs in more
   easily performing SIP peering.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   A SIP Service Provider (SSP) needs to identify the ingress Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] server of a peering network
   before it can signal and route SIP-based real-time communications
   sessions.  This function of locating the ingress SIP server of a
   peering network is typically performed by the egress SIP server of
   the SSP originating the SIP session.  Also, the ingress server in the
   peering network needs to locate the originating SSP's egress server
   in situations where the peering connection is terminated after
   receiving a SIP request or if the egress SIP server of originating
   SSP fails.  The SIP servers at the originating and peering sides use
   DNS procedures, using both SRV [RFC3261] and NAPTR [RFC3404] records,
   in order to locate each other.


3.  Session Peering Setup

   SIP systems are represented by user agents (UA).  The diagram below
   shows the case of Direct Peering where a user agent (UA1), hosted by
   a SSP (SSP1), initiates a SIP session to a User Agent (UA2), hosted
   by another SSP (SSP2).  The egress SIP server of SSP1 is a Signaling
   Path Border Element (SBE) as defined in Section 3 of [RFC5486],
   called SBE1, that interfaces with session peering SSP2.  The SIP
   session initiated by UA1 is received by this network element, SBE1.
   The resource to which the SIP request needs to be routed by SBE1 is
   identified by a SIP or SIPS URI.  For example, this could be the SIP
   URI of UA2 found in the Request-URI of the SIP request received by
   SBE1.  Alternatively, for example, this could also be the next hop
   from SBE1 found in the topmost Route header of SIP request.  In order
   to determine the resource to route the request to, SSP1 MAY make use
   of ENUM [RFC3761] lookup services or some other internal lookup to
   determine the SIP URI of the resource.  Such an ENUM lookup service
   may use e164.arpa or one or more other private ENUM zones.  This
   lookup MAY be performed by SBE1 or another network element of SSP1.

                                 Figure 1

   In order to route the SIP request to this resource in SSP2, SBE1
   needs to determine the ingress SIP signaling path border element for
   SSP2, called SBE2, by resolving the SIP or SIPS URI using DNS.  SBE1
   makes use of the NAPTR and DNS SRV mechanism defined in [RFC3263] to
   determine the IP address, port, and transport protocol for peering
   with the SSP2 ingress SIP proxy server (i.e.  SBE2).  SBE1 and SBE2
   which are involved in the session peering, support a set of protocols
   and have list of preferences for these protocols.

   The figure below shows the case of Indirect Peering where SBE2 is the
   ingress SIP server of a transit SSP.  The mechanism to locate SBE2 is
   the same as described for Direct Peering scenario.

                                 Figure 2

   The figure below shows a high level SIP call flow setting up a Direct
   Peering session between SSP1 and SP2.  In this call flow a VoIP
   session is established between a caller, Bob (sip:bob@example1.com),
   in SSP1 and callee, Alice(sip:alice@example2.com), in SP2 using SIP
   INVITE request.  All SIP signaling MUST go through both SBE1 and
   SBE2, as these are the ingress and egress points in SSP1 and SP2
   networks, respectively.

   The target, to which the request is sent, is determined by SBE1 as
   follows:

3.1.  Target Determination

   The target resource is identified with a SIP or SIPS URI.  This is
   the URI in the Route header, if present, or the URI from the request
   URI of the SIP request received by SBE1.  The host value of the
   hostport component of the URI is the TARGET [EDITORIAL NOTE: VERIFY /
   CLARIFY AS NEEDED].  This TARGET is the domain to be contacted.  The
   NAPTR/SRV/A resource record lookup as described in the following
   section should be skipped if the transport/port/IP address is already
   specified for the target URI.

3.2.  NAPTR Lookup

   Next, SBE1 determines the transport protocol of the TARGET, SBE2, by
   performing a NAPTR query for the TARGET.  NAPTR processing as
   described in [RFC2915] will result in the discovery of the most
   preferred transport protocol [EDITORIAL NOTE: CONSIDER REWORDING /
   VALIDATE PREVIOUS 3 WORDS] of a server instance of SBE2 and SRV
   records.

   Considering our example call flow above [EDITORIAL NOTE: INCL LOCAL
   REFERENCE HERE], SBE1 wishes to resolve sip:alice@example.com and
   performs a NAPTR query for that TARGET domain example.com, and the
   following NAPTR records are returned:

   ;         order   pref  flags   service         regexp   replacement
   IN NAPTR  50  50  "s"    "SIPS+D2T"   ""  _sips._tcp.example.com
   IN NAPTR  90  50  "s"    "SIP+D2T"    ""  _sip._tcp.example.com
   IN NAPTR 100  50  "s"    "SIP+D2U"    ""  _sip._udp.example.com

                                 Figure 4

   DNS MUST return at least three records - one with "SIP+D2T", one with
   "SIP+D2U" and one with "SIPS+D2T" service type for the case of Direct
   and Indirect Peering (section 4.3 in [RFC5486]).  For Indirect
   Peering (section 4.4 in [RFC5486]) since domain validation as
   specified in Section 26.3.2.2 of [RFC3261] for TLS at layer 5 will
   not work, SIPS over TLS cannot be used.  [EDITORIAL NOTE: J.ELWELL
   CONCERN RAISED - IF THIS IS CASE, FEELS WE DO NOT HAVE A SECURE
   SOLUTION.  WG FEEDBACK?]

3.3.  SRV Lookup

   Depending on what transport protocols SBE1 supports, SBE1 selects one
   from the preference list of NAPTR results and performs the SRV lookup
   to obtain a list of available server instances for SBE2.  TLS SHOULD
   be the preferred transport protocol for peering between SBE1 and
   SBE2.

Internet-Draft   DNS SRV and NAPTR Records for SPEERMINT  September 2009


   In our example, SBE1 uses TCP, the SRV lookup for
   _sip._tcp.example.com would return this list of available servers :

   ;;    Priority Weight   Port   Target
   IN SRV  0        1      5060   server1.example.com
   IN SRV  0        2      5060   server2.example.com

                                 Figure 5

   Alternatively, if no NAPTR records are found, then SBE1 uses the
   preferred transport protocol and issues an SRV query for that
   specific transport using "sips" for SIPS URI and SIP URI with TLS and
   "sip" for SIP URI as the SRV domain prefix.

   In our example, SBE1 prefers to use TCP and target SIP URI of SP2 is
   sip:alice@example2.com, it sends a SRV query for
   _sip._tcp.example2.com.

   The SRV responses MAY also include A and/or AAAA records with it.

3.4.  Using SRV Results

   If A records or AAAA records are not returned with the SRV responses,
   procedures from [RFC2782] describes how to use and interpret the
   results obtained from the SRV query.  The target entry of the SRV RRs
   is looked up by querying the DNS for address records.  If the SRV
   response from DNS includes A or AAAA records with it, it will cut
   down on round trips and lookup of DNS again for target entry.  On
   determining the transport protocol, service, port and address record
   from the SRV RRs as described above, the SBE1 will try to connect to
   the (protocol, address, service).  Once the connection is established
   to an available instance of SBE2, SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2.
   SBE1 MUST act in a stateful manner and any retransmission of SIP
   requests for a specific SIP transaction, including ACKS for non-2xx
   response or CANCEL for that SIP transaction MUST go to the same
   server instance of SBE2.

   When SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2, it SHOULD set the sent-by
   parameter of the topmost Via header in the SIP request to a domain
   that identifies SBE1.  It MUST NOT specify the port.

   [EDITORIAL NOTE: SHOULD THE ABOVE SENTENCE SAY MUST NOT OR SOMETHING
   ELSE?]

   [EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX SUGGESTS HAVING A SIP EXPERT REVIEW 4.2 ON
   SENT-BY]

   [EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX SUGGESTS A CALL FLOW FOR 4.2 - DOES WG AGREE?]

4.  High Availability

   High Availability is ensured by detecting failures in the ability to
   connect to SBE1 and SBE2 server instances.  In the event of a
   failure, when SBE1 tries to send SIP INVITE to SBE2, the following
   failures could occur:

4.1.  SBE1 Fails to Reach SBE2

   A 503 error response is reported by the transaction layer, or failure
   can occur at the transport layer due to TCP disconnect in connection,
   ICMP error in UDP or time out at transport layer or SIP layer timeout
   when its not receiving any SIP response.  In such situations, SBE1
   tries a new SIP request transaction to the next available server
   instance of SBE2 as determined by SRV RRs entry.  The SIP T1 timer on
   SBE1 SHOULD be configurable with a upper limit value of 500ms.  A
   shorter value of T1, say 100ms, reflects a faster fail-over support.

   [EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX FINDS FIRST SENTENCE ABOVE CONFUSING - CONSIDER
   REWORDING IT]

   [EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX SUGGESTS ADDING A REF TO PROPER SECTION OF SRV
   DOC, AS WELL AS REF FOR SIP TIMERS]

4.2.  Using SRV Results

   Failure may also occur after the request is received by SBE2 from
   SBE1 due to closure of the transport connection the request came in
   on at SBE2, before the response can be sent back to SBE1.  In this
   situation, SBE2 uses the domain value present in the 'sent-by'
   parameter in the top most Via header of the received SIP INVITE, and
   queries for SRV records at this domain name using the service
   identifier "_sips" if the Via transport is "TLS", "_sip" otherwise.
   The sorted list of SRV RRs are obtained and used as described in
   [RFC2782] to send the response back to SBE1.  If the topmost element
   in the list of server instances of SBE1 fails, the next available one
   is tried.

   [EDITORIAL NOTE: FOR NEXT REV - SHOULD WE ADD CALL FLOW FOR FAILURE
   SCENARIOS DESCRIBED IN 4.1 AND 4.2?]

   [EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX RECOMMENDS WE CLARIFY WHETHER THE DESCRIBED
   FUNCTIONALITY HERE IS 'ON TOP' OF STANDARD SIP OR NEW FUNCTIONALITY,
   AND THAT A REF TO THE PROPER SECTION OF RFC3261 IS CONSIDERED]

5.  Caching/TTL

5.1.  Caching

   SBE SHOULD use caching of DNS results to eliminate unnecessary DNS
   queries.

5.2.  TTL

   SRV RRs have a TTL value based on which the SBE1 caches the entry for
   that duration, if it supports caching, and any further requests to
   the same TARGET domain are delivered to the cached server instance.
   The TTL recommended for SRV is about 1 hr.  The TTL for NAPTR is much
   higher, about 1 day (24hrs) since the NAPTR records do not vary that
   often as compared to SRV.
