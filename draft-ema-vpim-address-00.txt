     1. Abstract
     
     This document lists the various VPIM email addresses that are 
     currently in common use and defines several new address formats for 
     special case usage.
     
     2. Introduction
     
     [VPIM2] does not place any restrictions on the email address 
     format.  However, it does suggest to use a numeric LHS since many 
     legacy voice mail systems only use digits to identify mailboxes.  
     Further, it suggests a structure to handle private, and 
     international numbering plans including extensions.  This format 
     has become deployed in most existing VPIM v2 systems, further some 
     systems will only accept messages from addresses with a numeric LHS.
     
     [VPIM3] does not describe addressing at all.  The LHS format is 
     left to the discretion of the mailbox owner.  However, it is useful 
     in some cases (like submission or tunneling) to specify a LHS 
     format.  A format based on RFC2303 is presented.
     
     3. VPIM v2 Addressing 
     
     RFC 822 addresses are based on the domain name system.  This naming
     system has two components: the local part, used for username or 
     mailbox identification; and the host part, used for global machine 
     identification.
     
     As per RFC 822, the local part of the address is a US-ASCII string 
     uniquely identifying a mailbox on a destination system.  For voice 
     messaging, the local part is a printable string containing the 
     mailbox ID of the originator or recipient.  While alphanumeric 
     characters and long mailbox identifiers are permitted, most voice
     mail networks rely on numeric mailbox identifiers to retain 
     compatibility with the limited 10 digit telephone keypad.  As a 
     result, many voice messaging systems may only be able to handle a 
     numeric local part.  The reception of alphanumeric local parts on 
     these systems may result in:  the address being mapped to some 
     locally unique (but confusing to the recipient) number, the address 
     being deleted (but the message is still delivered), or in the worst
     case the entire message being rejected.  Or, all addresses may be 
     dropped (so that a reply-all does not reach only some of the 
     intended recipients). Additionally, it may be difficult 
     to enter addresses on these systems with an alphanumeric local part 
     without complex key sequences or some form of directory lookup.

     In the absence of a global directory, specification of the local 
     part is expected to conform to international or private telephone 
     numbering plans.  It is likely that private numbering plans will 
     prevail (for corporate networks) and these are left for local 
     definition.  However, if the PSTN numbering plan is used (for 
     corporate or public networks), it is that the public telephone 
     number format be according to the international numbering plan 
     described in [E.164]. The indication that the local part is a 
     public telephone number is given by a preceding Ô+Õ (the Ô+Õ would 
     not be entered from a telephone keypad, it is added by the system 
     as a flag).  Since the primary information in the numeric scheme 
     is contained by the digits, other character separators (e.g. Ô-Õ) 
     may be ignored (i.e. to allow parsing of the numeric local mailbox) 
     or may be used to recognize distinct portions of the telephone 
     number (e.g. country code).  The specification of the local part of
     a VPIM address can be split into the four groups described below:
     
        1) mailbox number
            - for use as a private numbering plan (any number of 
              digits)
            - e.g.  5552722@lucent.com
        2) mailbox number+extension
            - for use as a private numbering plan with extensions
              any number of digits, use of Ô+Õ as separator
            - e.g.  5552722+111@lucent.com
        3) +international number
            - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164
               maximum of 15 digits
            - e.g.  +16137637582@nortelnetworks.com
        4)  +international number+extension
            - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164
              maximum of 15 digits, with an extension (e.g. behind a
              PBX) that has a maximum of 15 digits. 
            - e.g.  +17035245550+230@ema.org
   
     Deployed VPIM v2 systems typically support the first group, that is 
     mailbox number on the LHS.  Note that in many cases the mailbox is 
     simply the local number (e.g., in North America the 10-digit NANP 
     number is used).
     
     4. VPIM v3 Addressing 
   
     VPIM Version 3 places no restrictions on the form of the Internet 
     address. VPIM Version 3 systems must be capable of receiving an 
     arbitrary email address and generating a reply to that address.  No 
     inferences about the structure of the local part (LHS) should be 
     necessary.

     Recipients email addresses must be created in a form compatible 
     with the recipients system and consistent with the address entry 
     capabilities of a telephone user interface (e.g., while alpha
     numerics can be entered, special characters would be difficult)
     
     4.1 VPIM v3 Submission LHS 
   
     Limited capability voice mail machines may send messages by default 
     to an external message submission gateway.  These gateways will 
     convert the unresolved telephone number of the recipient into a 
     legitimate email address.  Messages requiring address resolution 
     must be sent to a submission system which will convert the 
     submitted address into the routeable email address. 
     
     Telephone numbers sent in a VPIM Version 3 submission mode MUST be 
     sent in one of the following forms.
     
     This is based on the format defined in [PSTN-ADDR].
     
     4.1.1 The VPIM address
   
     For voice messages that are intended to be sent as VPIM messages 
     the service-selector element is defined to be 
     
           vpim-service-selector = "VPIM"
     
        The resultant vpim-address and vpim-mbox are formally
     
           vpim-address = vpim-mbox
                         [ pstn-recipient ]
     
           vpim-mbox = [ "VPIM=" ] ( global-phone / local-phone )
                       [ sub-addr-spec  ext-addr-spec ]
     
           ext-addr-spec = [ ext-sep sub-addr ]
     
           ext-sep = ( "/EXT=" / "+" )
                     ; note that "/EXT=" is case INSENSITIVE
                     ; "+" is used for compatibility with current
                     ; VPIM addressing
     
        For clarity, here is an example of a very simple vpim-mbox:
     
           VPIM=6137637582

     4.1.2 The Voice address
   
     For voice messages that are intended to be sent as a voice 
     outdialing at the destination system, the service-selector element 
     is defined to be 
     
           voice-service-selector = "VOICE"
     
        The resultant voice-address and voice-mbox are formally
     
           voice-address = voice-mbox
                         [ pstn-recipient ]
     
           voice-mbox = "VOICE=" ( global-phone / local-phone )
                      [ sub-addr-spec ] [post-sep post-dial]
     
        For more clarity, here is an example of a very simple voice-
        mbox:
     
           VOICE=+3940226338
     
     4.1.3 The AMIS address
    
     For voice messages that are intended to be sent as AMIS (Audio 
     Messaging Interchange Specification) voice mail messages at the 
     destination, the service-selector element is defined to be 
     
           amis-service-selector = "AMIS"
     
        The resultant amis-address and amis-mbox are formally
     
           amis-address = amis-mbox
                          [ pstn-recipient ]
     
           amis-mbox = "AMIS=" amis-mailbox 
                       [ "/SYSNUM=" amis-sysnum ]
                       ; note that "/SYSNUM=" is case INSENSITIVE
     
     
           amis-mailbox = [ amis-mailbox-numberplan ][ "+" ]
                          amis-mailbox-id [ "+" ]
                          [ amis-mailbox-extension ]
                          ; The "+" separators are used to be compatible 
                          ; the X.400 AMIS-D mailbox definition -- 
                          ; if more than one element is present, both
                          ; "+" must appear.  Note also
                          ; that the total length of this field is
                          ; restricted to 32 characters by AMIS-D.

     As defined in [FAX-ADDR]
     
     4.2 VPIM v3 Submission Addresses
   
     Based on RFC2303, these are the resultant email addresses for the 
     LHS presented above.  VPIM v3 systems that support submission MUST 
     accept, translate (if necessary), and forward messages sent to 
     these addresses. 
     
     4.2.1 The vpim-email
    
        The vpim-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for
        VPIM over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the 
        service-selector distinction is set to "VPIM".
     
              vpim-email =  ["/"] vpim-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn
     
        In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a VPIM
        capable messaging system where the attached message will 
        be delivered properly.

     4.2.2 The voice-email
    
        The voice-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for 
        the voice outdialing over the Internet e-mail transport system, 
        where the service-selector distinction is set to "VOICE".
     
              voice-email =  ["/"] voice-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn
     
        In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device
        that will perform an outdial, that is for example, make a 
        telephone call to the specified number and play a voice 
        attachment.
     
     
     4.2.3 The amis-email
        The amis-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for 
        the AMIS over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the 
        service-selector distinction is set to "AMIS".
     
              amis-email =  ["/"] amis-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn
     
        In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device
        that acts as a gateway to an AMIS network where the attached
        voice message will be delivered properly.
