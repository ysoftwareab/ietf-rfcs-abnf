Abstract

   This document defines support for the Authentication Request Control
   and the Authentication Response Control. Controls are an LDAP
   protocol version 3 extension, to allow passing arbitrary control
   information along with a standard request to a server, and to receive
   arbitrary information back with a standard result. The Authentication
   Request Control may be submitted by a client in a bind request if
   authenticating with version 3 of the LDAP protocol. In the LDAP
   server's bind response, it may then include an Authentication
   Response Control. The response control contains the identity assumed
   by the client. This is useful when there is a mapping step or other
   indirection during the bind, so that the client can be told what LDAP
   identity was granted. Client authentication with certificates is the
   primary situation where this applies. Also, some SASL authentication
   mechanisms may not involve the client explicitly providing a DN.


1. Introduction



Expires October 2000                                          [Page 1]

AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE CONTROL                            April, 2000


   Version 3 of the LDAP protocol provides a means of supplying
   arbitrary additional information along with a request to an LDAP
   server, and receiving arbitrary additional response information. The
   Control protocol extension is described in [LDAPv3], section 4.1.12.
   This document defines a way for a server to return the identity
   assumed by a client on binding using the Control mechanism.

   The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" used in this document  are
   to be interpreted as described in [RFCKeyWords].


2. Publishing support for the Authentication Request Control and the
   Authentication Response Control

   Support for the Authentication Request Control and the Authentication
   Response Control is indicated by the presence of the OIDs
   2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16 and 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15, respectively,
   in the supportedExtension attribute of a server's root DSE.


3. Authentication Request Control


   This control MAY be included in any bind request which specifies
   protocol version 3, as part of the controls field of the LDAPMessage
   as defined in [LDAPv3].

   The controlType is "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16", the criticality field
   is FALSE or absent, and the controlValue is absent.

4. Authentication Response Control


   This control may be included in any final bind response where the
   bind request included an Authentication Request Control, as part of
   the controls field of the LDAPMessage as defined in [LDAPv3].

   The controlType is "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15". If the bind request
   succeeded and resulted in an identity (not anonymous), the
   controlValue contains the distinguished name of the authentication
   identity. If the bind request resulted in anonymous authentication,
   the controlValue field is a string of zero length.

   If the bind request failed, the control is not included in the bind
   response.

   During client authentication with certificates [AUTH], a client may
   possess more than one certificate and not be able to determine which
   one was ultimately selected for authentication to the server. The
   subject DN field in the selected certificate may not correspond
   exactly to a DN in the directory, but rather have gone through a
   mapping process controlled by the server. On completing the
   certificate-based authentication, the client may issue a SASL [SASL]

AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE CONTROL                            April, 2000


   bind request, specifying the EXTERNAL mechanism and including an
   Authentication Request Control. The bind response MAY include an
   authentication response control indicating the DN in the server's DIT
   which the certificate was mapped to.


5. Security Considerations

   The Authentication Response Control is subject to standard LDAP
   security considerations. The control may be passed over a secure as
   well as over an insecure channel. No additional confidential
   information is passed in the control.

9. Changes from draft-weltman-ldapv3-auth-response-01.txt


9.1 Authentication Request Control

   An Authentication Response Control is now only returned if the client
   requested one by submitting an Authentication Request Control.

9.2 Contents of Authentication Response Control

   Rather than returning both the authentication DN and the
   authentication mechanism, the control only returns the authentication
   DN.
