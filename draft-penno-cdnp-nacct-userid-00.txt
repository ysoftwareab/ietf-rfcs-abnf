Abstract

   We present here a protocol in which edge network equipments, also 
   known as IPServices devices, Broadband RASes, Edge Routers and 
   so forth, can inform surrogates or traffic interception devices 
   extended information about the user, such as geographic location, 
   QoS policy, fully qualified login (name@domain.name)and start and 
   stop times (or its equivalent for non-session based users).

   This protocol allows services provider, access providers and content
   delivery networks to provide personalized or differentiated 
   treatment to each user individually, and also to enhance accounting 
   considerably.

1. Subscriber Awareness

   Today there is a new class of devices that sit on the edge of the
   network (between the access and the core), and represent the last 
   point on a network that there is subscriber awareness. One should 
   understand subscribers awareness as the capability to infer who is 
   the actual user on the network and his profile. 

   Examples of the identity of the user are (but not limited to) source 
   IP address or name@domain (PPPoE based) for Cable users, ATM VC or 
   name@domain (PPPoE or PPPoA based) for DSL users, name@domain (PPP 
   based) for dial-up subscribers, DS0 channels or a IP network for 
   leased line users. 

   The profile of the user may include (but is not limited to) QoS 
   parameters, geographic location, start and stop times (or its 
   equivalent for non-session based users), IP address in use. 

2. Subscriber Awareness and Personalized Services

   Since these devices know exactly who the subscriber is, they can
   control the access of these subscribers to the network and offer 
   personalized services on an per user basis. Example of these 
   services are (but not limited to) traffic shaping, Diffserv marking 
   and policing, firewall and VPNs.

3. Personalized Services and Content Delivery
   
   There is a lot of effort going on to standardize methods for
   content-delivery, distribution, accounting and request-routing.

Internet-Draft     User Profile Identification Protocol     January,2001


   Although one can expect an major improvement on content delivery in 
   general from this effort, these will be done on a coarse level. We 
   believe that with the kind of information an edge device can pass to 
   a surrogate server or a traffic interception device, the delivery 
   and accounting of content can be done on a much more granular
   level, on a per subscriber basis. This open up a whole new set of
   possibilities of content delivery.


4. Framework for Session based users

   We present here a framework of how the protocol would work for
   session based users. Session based users include those that access 
   the network through one of the following (but not limited to) 
   protocols: Dial-up PPP, PPPoE, PPPoA and L2TP. 

                                             |------------|
                                         4,5 |Traffic     |
                                       ----->|Interception|
                               2,3    /      |Device      |
   |------|        1        |------|_/       |------------|
   | User |---->Access----->| Edge |
   |------|     Network     |Device|_
                            |------| \
                                      \  4,5 |---------|
                                       ----->|Surrogate|
                                             |Server   |
                                             |---------|

   1. The user establishes a PPP session to the Edge Device 
   2. Edge device authenticates user locally or on an external server
      such as a Radius or LDAP database.
   3. If authentication sucessful, the Edge Device applies the services  
      associated to this user profile to his session.
   4. The Edge device then package some or all the information that it 
      has about the user and sends it to one or more traffic 
      interception devices or surrogate servers. 

   The type of information the edge device MAY send is start time of 
   the session, name@domain, Diffserv policy, IP address in use and 
   geographic location. Of course this can be expanded to accommodate 
   several other useful parameters.

   5.When the user is disconnected, the edge device MAY inform (as
     approriate) surrogate servers or traffic interception devices the 
     stop time of the session, name@domain and IP adress that was in 
     use.

Internet-Draft     User Profile Identification Protocol     January,2001

5. Framework for Non-Session based users

   The framework for non-session based users is the same as for session 
   based users. What changes is the type of information you can pass to 
   other devices and the accuracy of identification of the subscriber.

   For instance, if DSL provider A does not require that its users 
   access the network through some session based protocol such as 
   PPPoE, this means that a edge device could identify the subscriber 
   by ATM VC of his DSL modem or the source IP address of his personal 
   computer.
    
   This method of course means that in the case of identification by 
   the ATM VC, all users behind the modem would be treated as the same 
   susbcriber. They are invisible to the edge device. One way to 
   address this is to identify the subscriber by its source IP address 
   so that if there are several personal computers behind a DSL modem, 
   a edge device could apply different services to each one.

   The later solution also has a drawback when N:M NAT is used or when 
   several users share the same personal computer. The drawback when
   N:M NAT is used is pretty straightforward. Since there is a device 
   translating several source IP address into some other subset, this 
   implies a loss of granularity on the identification of the actual 
   user. 

   In the case where several users share the same personal computer, 
   there is no way to differentiate when a particular user stopped 
   using and a new one started. One solution could be the use of some 
   web login method (similar to web mail used today). In other words, 
   when user A sits on his shared personal computer, he has to go to a 
   specific web page and put his username and password, which would be 
   passed to the edge device, allowing it to accurately identifiy the 
   subscriber and apply his personalized services. More on 
   identification of users can be found in [Identity]

   In the cases where there is no web login, the start of the session
   would be when the first packet with a specific source IP address or 
   that through a specific ATM VC reaches the edge device. The stop of 
   the session would be based on some idle or session timeout.

6. Proposed Protocol

   The Radius Accounting Protocol is used to for carrying accounting
   information between a Network Access Server and a shared Accounting 
   server. The User Profile Information Protocol is used to carry 
   profile information, which cab be used to offer personalized services
   and to enahnce accounting, between an edge network equipment and a 
   suurogate server or traffic interception device .

Internet-Draft     User Profile Identification Protocol     January,2001

   The similarity between the two protocols is obvious, and hence the 
   User Profile Information Protocol could be modeled after the Radius
   Accounting Protocol. Another similarity is that the Radius Accounting 
   protocol was made to pass tuples of attribute-value, which would suit 
   the User Information Protocol. For instance

 
   |-------------------------------|
   |start-time | YYYYMMDD HH:MM UTC|
   |username   | name@domain       |
   |diffserv   | AFXDPY            |
   |...        | ...               |
   |-------------------------------|
