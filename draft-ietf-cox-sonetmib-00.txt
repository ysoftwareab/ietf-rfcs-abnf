          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing SONET objects.  This document is

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  They are:

               RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
               describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.  RFC 1212 defines a more concise description
               mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

               RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed
               objects for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213,
               defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on
               implementation experience and new operational
               requirements.

               RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
               network access to managed objects.


          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMP.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in RFC 1212 [12].

          Internet Draft          SONET Objects                July 1992


          5.  Overview

          These objects are used when the particular media being used to
          realize an interface is a SONET interface.  At present, this
          applies to these values of the ifType variable in the
          Internet-standard MIB:

               sonet (xx)

          The definitions contained herein are based on the SONET
          specifications in ANSI T1.105 and T1.106-1988 [9, 9a, 10].

          5.1.  Binding between SONET Interfaces, Sections, Lines,
          Paths, and   Virtual Tributaries"

          SONET is layered into five parts as follows:

          because some applications allow SONET STS-1 and STS-3 signals
          to be implemented over coax.

          A device is considered to be either a Section Terminating
          Entity (STE), a Line Terminating Entity (LTE), or a Path
          Terminating Entity (PTE).  If a device is a STE, then it also
          terminates the Photonic Layer.  If a device is a LTE, then it
          also terminates the Photonic and Section Layers.  If a device
          is a PTE, then it also terminates the Photonic, Section and
          Line Layers.  A PTE terminates the VT layer if the SONET
          signal contains Virtual Tributaries (VTs).

          An example of an STE is an SONET optical regenerator.  An
          example of an LTE is an SONET multiplexer.  An example of an
          PTE is a Digital Cross Connect System
          This MIB is used to manage SONET interfaces on a SONET device.
          All interfaces are assigned an integer value equal to ifIndex.
          The value for ifIndex is equal to the values for
          sonetGeneralIndex, sonetPhotonicIndex, sonetSectionIndex,
          sonetLineIndex, sonetPathIfIndex, sonetVTIfIndex, etc.


          5.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module

          This MIB is used to monitor devices that have SONET
          interfaces.

          5.3.  SONET Terminology

          The terminology used in this document to describe error
          conditions on a SONET circuit as monitored by a SONET system
          are from the ANSI T1M1.3/92-005R1 [11].  If the definition in
          this document does not match the definition in the ANSI
          T1M1.3/92-005R1 draft document, the implementer should follow
          the definition described in this document.

          Section Loss Of Frame (Out of Frame Event)
               An Out of Frame (OOF) event (or Severely Errored Frame
               Event) is entered when four contiguous errored frame
               alignment signals have been received.  The OOF event is
               cleared upon detecting two contiguous error-free frame
               words.  Any implementation of the frame recovery
               circuitry which achieves realignment following an OOF
               within the 250 microsecond (two frames) interval implied
               by this definition is acceptable.

          Internet Draft          SONET Objects                July 1992


               An Loss of Frame (LOF) defect is declared when an OOF
               persists for a period of 3 milliseconds.  The LOF defect
               is cleared when the incoming signal remains continuously
               in-frame for a period of 1 ms to 3 ms.

               An LOF failure is declared when the LOF defect persists
               for a period of 2 to 10 seconds.  The LOF failure is
               cleared when the LOF defect is absent for a period of
               less than or equal to 20 seconds.

          Loss of Signal
               The Loss of Signal (LOS) defect is declared when no
               transitions are detected on the incoming signal (before
               descrambling).  The LOS defect is detected  upon
               observing 2.3 to 100 microseconds of no transitions.  The
               LOS defect is cleared after a 125 microsecond interval
               (one frame) during which no LOS defect is detected.

               The LOS failure is declared when the LOS defect persists
               for a period of 2 to 10 seconds.  The LOS failure is
               cleared when the LOS defect is absent for a period of
               less than or equal to 20 seconds.  Declaration of LOS
               failure clears any existing LOF failure.  Clearing the
               LOS failure allows immediate declaration of the LOF
               failure if conditions warrant.

          STS-Path Loss of Pointer
               An Loss of Pointer (LOP) defect is declared when either a
               valid pointer is not detected in eight consecutive
               frames, or when eight consecutive frames are detected
               with the New Data Flag (NDF) set to "1001" without a
               valid concatenation indicator (see ANSI T1.105).  A LOP
               defect is cleared when either a valid pointer with a
               normal NDF set to "0110", or a valid concatenation
               indicator is detected for three contiguous frames.
               Incoming STS-Path AIS shall not result in the declaration
               of a LOP defect.

               A STS-Path LOP failure is declared when the STS-Path LOP
               defect persists for a period of 2 to 10 seconds.  A STS-
               Path LOP failure is cleared when the STS-Path LOP defect
               is absent for a period of less than or equal to 20
               seconds.

               A VT LOP defect is declared when either a valid pointer
               is not detected in eight consecutive VT superframes, or
               when eight consecutive VT superframes are detected with
               the NDF set to "1001" without a valid concatenation
               indicator.  A VT LOP defect is cleared when either a
               valid pointer with a normal NDF set to "0110", or a valid
               concatenation indicator is detected for three contiguous
               VT superframes.  Incoming VT-Path AIS shall not result in
               declaring a VT LOP defect.

               A VT LOP failure is declared when the VT LOP defect
               persists for a period of 2 to 10 seconds.  A VT LOP
               failure is cleared when the VT LOP defect is absent for a
               period of less than or equal to 20 seconds.

          Line Alarm Indication Signal
               A Line Alarm Indication Signal (L-AIS) is defined in ANSI
               T1.105.  The following criteria are specific to the L-AIS
               defect:

               --  Line AIS defect is detected as a "111" pattern in
               bits 6, 7, and 8 of the K2 byte in five consecutive
               frames.

               --  Line AIS defect is cleared when bits 6, 7, and 8 of
               the K2 byte do not contain the code "111" for five
               consecutive frames.

               A Line AIS failure is declared when the Line AIS defect
               persists for a period of 2 to 10 seconds.  A Line AIS
               failure is cleared when the Line AIS defect is absent for
               a period of less than or equal to 20 seconds.  The Line
               AIS failure declaration and clearing shall function
               properly in the presence of a random BER of 10^-3 or
               better.

          STS-Path Alarm Indication Signal
               The STS-Path Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) is defined in
               ANSI T1.105 as all ones in bytes H1, H2, and H3 as well
               as all ones in the entire STS SPE.  The following
               criteria are specific to the STS-Path AIS defect:

               -- STS-Path AIS defect is detected as all ones in bytes
               H1 and H2 in three contiguous frames.

               -- The STS-Path AIS defect is cleared when a valid STS
               Pointer is detected with the NDF set to "1001" (inverted)
               for one frame, or  "0110" (normal) for three contiguous
               frames.

               A STS-Path AIS failure is declared when the STS-Path AIS
               defect persists for a period of 2 to 10 seconds.  A STS-
               Path AIS failure is cleared when the STS-Path AIS defect
               is absent for a period of less than or equal to 20
               seconds.  The STS-Path AIS failure declaration and
               clearing shall function properly in the presence of a
               random BER of 10^-3 or better.

          VT-Path Alarm Indication Signal
               The VT-Path Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) is only
               applicable for VTs in the floating mode of operation.
               VT-Path AIS is used to alert the downstream VT Path
               Terminating Entity (PTE) of an upstream failure.  Upon
               detection of a failure, Line AIS, or STS-Path AIS, an STS
               PTE will generate downstream VT-Path AIS if the STS
               Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE) is carrying floating
               VTs.  VT-Path AIS is specified in ANSI T1.105 as all ones
               in bytes V1, V2, V3, and V4, as well as all ones in the
               entire VT SPE.  The following criteria are specific to
               VT-Path AIS defect:

               --  VT-Path AIS defect is detected by a VT PTE as all

               Line Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is generated by
               inserting the code "110" in bit positions 6, 7, and 8 of
               the K2 byte in STS-1 #1 of the STS-N signal.  Line RDI is
               defined in ANSI T1.105.  The following criteria are
               specific to Line RDI defect:

               --  Line RDI defect is a "110" code in bits 6, 7, and 8
               of the K2 byte of in STS-1 #1 in five consecutive frames.

               --  Line RDI defect is cleared when any code other than
               "110" is detected in bits 6, 7, and 8 of the K2 byte in
               five consecutive frames.

               A Line RDI failure is declared when the incoming Line RDI
               defects lasts for 2 to 10 seconds.  The Line RDI failure
               is cleared when no Line RDI defects are detected for
               period equal to or less than 20 seconds.

          STS-Path Remote Defect Indication
               STS-Path RDI defect is generated within 125 microseconds
               by the STS PTE upon detection of an AIS or LOP defect.
               STS-Path RDI defect is defined in ANSI T1.105.  The
               following requirements are specific to the STS-Path RDI
               defect:

               --  STS-Path RDI defect is the occurrence of a "1001"
               code in bits 1-4 of the STS-Path Status byte (G1) in five
               contiguous frames.

               --  STS-Path RDI defect is terminated when any code other
               than "1001" is detected in bits 1-4 of the STS-Path
               Status byte (G1) in five contiguous frames.
               STS-Path RDI defect is cleared immediately by the STS PTE
               when the AIS or LOP defect is no longer detected.

          VT-Path Remote Defect Indication
               VT Path RDI defect is generated within 500 microseconds
               by the VT PTE upon detection of an AIS or LOP defect.
               VT-Path RDI defect is defined in ANSI T1.105.  The
               following requirements are specific to VT-Path RDI
               defect:

               --  VT-Path RDI defect is the occurrence of a "1" in bit
               4 of the VT-Path Overhead byte (V5) in five contiguous
               frames.

               --  VT-Path RDI defect is terminated when a "0" is
               detected in bit 4 of the VT-Path Overhead byte (V5) for
               five contiguous frames.

               VT-Path RDI defect is terminated immediately by the VT
               PTE when the AIS or LOP defect is no longer detected.

          STS-Path Remote Alarm Indication (may be renamed Remote
               Failure Indication (RFI))
               STS-Path Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) is specified in
               ANSI T1.105.  The RAI failure is declared in the
               equipment within 5 ms of detecting the incoming STS-Path
               RAI Signal.  The following requirements are specific to
               the STS-Path RAI:

               --  STS-Path RAI is detected by all STS PTEs.  STS-Path
               RAI is detected by the upstream STS PTE as a "1" in bit
               five of the Path Status byte (G1) for ten contiguous
               frames.

               --  Removal of STS-Path Remote Alarm Indication failure
               is detected by a "0" in bit 5 of the G1 byte in ten
               contiguous frames.

               The STS-Path RAI failure is cleared within 50 ms of the
               detection of the deactivation of the incoming STS-Path
               Remote Alarm Indication Signal.

          VT-Path Remote Alarm Indication (may be renamed Remote Failure
               Indication (RFI))
               The VT-Path RAI is specified in ANSI T1.105.  The RAI
               failure is declared in the device within 5 ms of
               detecting the incoming VT-Path Remote Alarm Indication
               Signal.  The following criteria are specific to VT-Path
               RAI:

               --  VT-Path Remote Alarm Indication is generated by
               setting bit 8 in the VT-Path Overhead byte (V5) to "1" in
               ten contiguous VT superframes.

               --  Removal of VT-Path Remote Alarm Indication is
               detected by a "0" in bit 8 of the V5 byte received for
               ten contiguous VT superframes.

               The Remote Alarm Indication failure is cleared in the

               device within 50 ms of the detection of the deactivation
               of the incoming VT-Path Remote Alarm Indication signal.

          Coding Violation
               Coding Violations (CV) are Bit Interleaved Parity (BIP)
               errors that are detected in the incoming signal.  CV
               counters are incremented for each BIP error detected.
               That is, each BIP-8 can detect up to eight errors per
               STS-N frame, with each error incrementing the CV counter.
               Section CVs shall be collected using the BIP-8 in the B1
               byte located in the Section Overhead of STS-1 #1.  Line
               CVs shall be collected using the BIP-8s in B2 bytes
               located in the Line Overhead of each STS-1 (since all CVs
               on an STS-N line are counted together, this is equivalent
               to counting each error in the BIP-8*N contained in the B2
               bytes of the STS-N Line Overhead).  Thus, on an STS-N
               signal, up to 8 x N CVs may occur in each frame.  Path
               CVs shall be collected using the BIP-8 in the B3 byte of
               the STS-Path Overhead of the STS SPE.  VT CVs shall be
               collected using the BIP-2 in the V5 overhead byte of the
               floating VT.

          Errored Seconds
               At each layer, an Errored Second (ES) is a second with
               one or more Coding Violations at that layer OR one or
               more incoming defects (e.g., OOF, LOP, or AIS) at that
               layer has occurred.

          Severely Errored Seconds
               At each layer, an Severely Errored Second (SES) is a
               second with x or more CVs at that layer, or a second
               during which at least one or more incoming defects at
               that layer has occurred.  Values of x vary depending on
               the line rate and the Bit Error Rate.  See Section 5.4
               for values for x.

          Severely Errored Framing Seconds
               A Severely Errored Framing Second (SEFS) is a seconds
               with containing one or more OOF events.  This counter is
               only counted at the Section Layer.

          Unavailable Seconds
               At the Line, Path, and VT layers, an unavailable second
               is calculated by counting the number of seconds that the
               interface is unavailable.  At each layer, the SONET

          Internet Draft          SONET Objects                July 1992


               interface is said to be unavailable from the onset of 10
               contiguous SESs, or the onset of the condition leading to
               a failure.  If the condition leading to the failure was
               immediately preceded by one or more contiguous SESs, then
               the SONET interface unavailability starts from the onset
               of these SESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure is
               present, the SONET interface becomes available at the
               onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs.  Once
               unavailable, and if a failure is present, the SONET
               interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous
               seconds with no SESs, if the failure clearing time is
               less than or equal to 10 seconds.  If the failure
               clearing time is more than 10 seconds, the SONET
               interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous
               seconds with no SESs, or the onset period leading to the
               successful clearing condition, whichever occurs later.
               With respect to the SONET error counts at each layer, all
               counters at that layer are incremented while the SONET
               interface is deemed available at that layer.  While the
               interface is deemed unavailable at that layer, the only
               count that is incremented is UASs at that layer.

               A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
               crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
               foregoing description implies that the SES and UAS
               counters must be adjusted when the Unavailable Signal
               State is entered. Clearly, successive GETs of the
               affected sonetPathIntervalSES and sonetPathIntervalUAS
               (for the Line and VT also) objects will return differing
               values if the first GET occurs during the first few
               seconds of the window.  This is viewed as an unavoidable
               side-effect of selecting the presently defined managed
               objects as a basis for this memo.

          Circuit Identifier
               This is a character string specified by the circuit
               vendor, and is useful when communicating with the vendor
               during the troubleshooting process.
