Status of this Memo

    This document is an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are working
    documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas,
    and its Working Groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
    working documents as Internet Drafts.

    Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
    months.  Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by
    other documents at any time.  It is not appropriate to use Internet
    Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a
    "working draft" or "work in progress."

    Please check the 1id-abstracts.txt listing contained in the
    internet-drafts Shadow Directories on nic.ddn.mil, nnsc.nsf.net,

Abstract

    This Internet Draft provides a bibliography of documents which
    address the routing and addressing scaling problems in the current
    IP architecture, and the design of the next generation of the IP
    protocol suite, commonly referred to as IPv7.

    This document is intended to simplify the process of locating all
    of the relevant documents pertaining to this area.  These documents
    take various forms, including Request For Comments (RFCs), Internet
    Drafts (I-Ds), and other papers produced either by Working Groups
    of the IETF or individuals actively working in this area.  It is
    suggested that Internet Drafts related to this topic reference this
    bibliography I-D, which will be updated on a regular basis as new
    documents are published or existing ones are modified or change
    status, e.g. from Internet Draft to RFC.

INTERNET DRAFT         IP Version 7 Bibliography           November 1992


1.  Introduction

    Extensive work is being performed on the routing and addressing
    scaling problems of the current IP architecture, and on the design
    of the next generation of the IP protocol suite, which is commonly
    referred to as IPv7.  A large number of documents have been produced
    with various proposals about how to address these scaling problems
    and other future requirements of IPv7.  This bibliography is
    intended to serve as a quick reference to all of the relevant
    documents in this area.

    The documents listed below include general background information,
    specific proposals for short and medium-term solutions to the
    routing and addressing scaling problems, and also proposals for
    candidate IPv7 platforms and radically different routing, naming,
    and addressing architectures for the future Internet environment.
    The long-term proposals, besides addressing the scaling problems,
    are also concerned with supporting new capabilities such as resource
    reservation, mobile/portable IP hosts, dynamic host configuration,
    and policy-based/TOS routing.


2.  Bibliography

    The following table lists the known documents that deal with the
    IPv4 scaling problems and the IPv7 design issues.  The first column
    contains an acronym for the document, possibly appended with a
    number, which is a name that is commonly used to refer to that
    document or proposal.  The second column contains the title of the
    document followed by the on-line archive location, if one exists,
    where the document may be retrieved via "anonymous" ftp.  Almost
    all of the documents can be found at one of the following standard
    archive sites:

      o  East Coast (US)                          
         Address:  nnsc.nsf.net (128.89.1.178)
         Address:  nic.ddn.mil  (192.112.36.5)

      o  West Coast (US)                          
         Address:  ftp.nisc.sri.com (192.33.33.22)

      o  Pacific Rim                              
         Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)

    If the document can be found at one of the standard archive sites
    listed above, then only the directory and file name is given for
    the listed document.  If the document is located at some other
    archive site, then the name of the archive host followed by a
    colon character (':') precedes the directory and file name.  The
    last column in the table gives the name(s) of the author(s) of
    the document.

    Note that for the Internet Drafts listed above, the version number
    may be different if a newer version of the I-D has been released
    since the last update of this bibliography I-D.  The version number
    is the "nn" in the "-nn.txt" at the end of the file name, e.g. the
    "01" in "draft-tsuchiya-pip-overview-01.txt".

3.  Special Note

    Because of the problem of important documents expiring and being
    deleted from the on-line archives, another "anonymous" ftp archive
    has been set up on the host ipv7.gsfc.nasa.gov in the directory
    "pub/ietf/ipv7".  Also, to assist in retrieving the documents,
    symbolic links have been set up from the acronym listed in the
    table above to the full file name of the document.  Thus, to obtain
    the two NIMROD documents listed in the table, just ftp to host
    ipv7.gsfc.nasa.gov, change directory to "pub/ietf/ipv7", and do
    an "mget nimrod*".  Please note that the symbolic links are in
    all lower case.
