2. Introduction

   Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) directory [ROADMAP] has a defined syntax (i.e. data type)
   which constrains the structure and format of its values.

   The description of each syntax [SYNTAX] specifies how attribute or
   assertion values [MODELS] conforming to the syntax are normally
   represented when transferred in LDAP operations [PROT].  This
   representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding to
   distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.

   This document introduces a new category of attribute options
   [MODELS], called transfer encoding options, that allow attribute and
   assertion values to be transferred using an alternative method of
   encoding.  This document defines several transfer encoding options
   which can be used in an attribute description [MODELS] in an LDAP
   operation to specify that the associated attribute values or
   assertion value are, or are requested to be, encoded according to
   specific Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [X680] encoding rules,
   instead of the usual LDAP-specific encoding.


3. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and  "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORD].

4. Transfer Encoding Options

   Transfer encoding options enable attribute and assertion values to be
   transferred using an alternative method of encoding to the default
   LDAP-specific encoding.  In fact, some attribute and assertion
   syntaxes do not have a defined LDAP-specific encoding in which case
   the only way values of those syntaxes can be transferred is by using
   an alternative encoding.

   The binary option [BINARY] is not formally regarded as a transfer
   encoding option, though it has much in common with transfer encoding
   options.  The requirements governing the use of transfer encoding
   options do not apply to the binary option.  The requirements
   governing the use of the binary option are described elsewhere
   [BINARY].

   In terms of the protocol [PROT], a transfer encoding option specifies
   that the contents octets of an associated AttributeValue or
   AssertionValue OCTET STRING are a complete encoding of the relevant
   value according to the encoding method specified by the option.

   Where a transfer encoding option is present in an attribute
   description the associated attribute values or assertion value MUST
   be encoded according to the encoding method corresponding to the
   option.  Note that it is possible for a syntax to be defined such
   that its LDAP-specific encoding is exactly the same as its encoding
   according to some transfer encoding option (e.g. the LDAP-specific
   encoding might be defined to be the same as the BER encoding).

   Transfer encoding options are mutually exclusive.  An attribute
   description SHALL NOT contain more than one transfer encoding option,
   and SHALL NOT contain both a transfer encoding option and the binary
   option.

   Transfer encoding options are not tagging options [MODELS] so the
   presence of a transfer encoding option does not specify an attribute
   subtype.  An attribute description containing a transfer encoding
   option references exactly the same attribute as the same attribute
   description without the transfer encoding option.  The
   supertype/subtype relationships of attributes with tagging options
   are not altered in any way by the presence or absence of transfer
   encoding options.

   An attribute description SHALL be treated as unrecognized if it
   contains a transfer encoding option and the syntax of the attribute
   does not have an associated ASN.1 type [SYNTAX], or if the nominated
   encoding is not supported for that type.

INTERNET-DRAFT       LDAP: Transfer Encoding Options       June 19, 2003


   The presence or absence of a transfer encoding option only affects
   the transfer of attribute and assertion values in protocol; servers
   store any particular attribute value in a single format of their
   choosing.


5. Defined Transfer Encoding Options

   The attribute option string "transfer-ber" specifies that the
   associated attribute values or assertion value are (to be) encoded
   according to the Basic Encoding Rules [X690] of ASN.1.  This option
   is similar to the binary option [BINARY], however servers are more
   restricted in when they can use "transfer-ber" which leads to more
   predictability in the results returned to clients who request
   "transfer-ber".

   The attribute option string "transfer-der" specifies that the
   associated attribute values or assertion value are (to be) encoded
   according to the Distinguished Encoding Rules [X690] of ASN.1.

   The attribute option string "transfer-gser" specifies that the
   associated attribute values or assertion value are (to be) encoded
   according to the Generic String Encoding Rules [GSER].

   Note that, like all attribute options, the strings representing
   transfer encoding options are case insensitive.

   All future registrations of option strings for transfer encoding
   options should use the "transfer-" prefix so that LDAP clients and
   servers can recognize that an option is a transfer encoding option
   even though the particular encoding rules may be unrecognized.


6. Attributes Returned in a Search

   An LDAP search request [PROT] contains a list of the attributes (the
   requested attributes list) to be returned from each entry matching
   the search filter.  An attribute description in the requested
   attributes list also implicitly requests all subtypes of the
   attribute type in the attribute description, whether through
   attribute subtyping or attribute tagging option subtyping [MODELS].

   The requested attributes list MAY contain attribute descriptions with
   a transfer encoding option, but MUST NOT contain two attribute
   descriptions with the same attribute type and the same tagging
   options (even if only one of them has a transfer encoding option).  A
   transfer encoding option in an attribute description in the requested
   attributes list implicitly applies to the subtypes of the attribute

   type in the attribute description.

   If the list of attributes in a search request is empty, or contains
   the special attribute description string "*", then all user
   attributes are requested to be returned.

   This specification defines an open-ended set of special attribute
   description strings that consist of the asterisk character followed
   by any defined transfer encoding option, e.g. "*;transfer-ber",
   "*;transfer-gser".  These special attribute description strings
   request that all user attributes be returned in the encoding
   specified by the option.  The requested attributes list MUST NOT
   contain more than one of the special attribute description strings
   beginning with "*".

   In general, it is possible for a particular attribute to be
   explicitly requested by an attribute description and/or implicitly
   requested by the attribute descriptions of one or more of its
   supertypes, or by one of the special attribute description strings
   beginning with "*".  In such cases the effective transfer encoding
   being requested for a particular attribute is determined by the
   transfer encoding option (or lack therof) in the most specific
   attribute description in the requested attributes list that applies
   to the attribute.

   An applicable attribute description with an actual attribute type is
   more specific than one of the special attribute description strings
   beginning with "*".

   If the attribute type of one applicable attribute description is a
   direct or indirect subtype of the attribute type in another
   applicable attribute description then the first attribute description
   is more specific than the second attribute description.

   If two applicable attribute descriptions have the same attribute type
   and the tagging options of the first attribute description are a
   superset of the tagging options of the second attribute description
   then the first attribute description is more specific than the second
   attribute description.

   Attributes MUST either be returned in the effective transfer encoding
   requested, be returned with no attribute values, or be omitted from
   the results.  An attribute SHALL NOT be returned using an encoding
   other than the effective transfer encoding requested.

   Regardless of the encoding chosen, a particular attribute value is
   returned at most once.

7. Syntaxes Requiring Binary Transfer

   Certain syntaxes are required to be transferred in the BER encoded
   form.  These syntaxes are said to have a binary transfer requirement.
   The Certificate, Certificate List, Certificate Pair and Supported
   Algorithm syntaxes [PKI] are examples of syntaxes with a binary
   transfer requirement.  These syntaxes also have an additional
   requirement that the exact BER encoding must be preserved.  Note that
   this is a property of the syntaxes themselves, and not a property of
   the binary option or any of the transfer encoding options.

   Transfer encoding options SHALL take precedence over the requirement
   for binary transfer.  For example, if the effective transfer encoding
   requested is say "transfer-gser", then attribute values of a syntax
   with a binary transfer requirement will be GSER encoded.  In the
   absence of a transfer encoding option the normal rules on binary
   transfer and the use of the binary option SHALL apply.


8. Security Considerations

   There is a requirement on some attribute syntaxes that the exact BER
   encoding of values of that syntax be preserved.  In general, a
   transformation from the BER encoding into some other encoding (e.g.
   GSER) and back into the BER encoding will not necessarily reproduce
   exactly the octets of the original BER encoding.

   Applications needing the original BER encoding to be preserved, e.g.
   for the verification of digital signatures, MUST NOT request
   attributes with such a requirement using a transfer encoding option.
   These attributes MUST be requested explicitly or implicitly with the
   binary option, or implicitly without the binary option (or any
   transfer encoding option).

   When interpreting security-sensitive fields, and in particular fields
   used to grant or deny access, implementations MUST ensure that any
   matching rule comparisons are done on the underlying abstract value,
   regardless of the particular encoding used.


9. IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is requested to update
   the LDAP attribute description option registry [BCP64] as indicated
   by the following templates:
