                1 IANA-L3: The Assigned Internet Protocol Number 
                  (layer 3 (L3)) is exported in the Selector ID. 
                  See http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-
                  numbers. 
                 
                2 PANA-L3: Proprietary layer 3 definition. An 
                  enterprise can export its own layer 3 protocol 
                  numbers. The Selector ID has a global 
                  significance for all devices from the same 
                  enterprise. 
                 
                3 IANA-L4: The IANA layer 4 (L4) well-known port 
                  number is exported in the Selector ID. See 
                  [IANA-PORTS]. Note: as an IPFIX flow is 
                  unidirectional, it contains the destination 
                  port in a flow from the client to the server. 
                 
                4 PANA-L4: Proprietary layer 4 definition. An 
                  enterprise can export its own layer 4 port 
                  numbers. The Selector ID has global 
                  significance for devices from the same 
                  enterprise. Example: IPFIX had the port 4739 
                  pre-assigned in the IETF draft for years. 
                  While waiting for the RFC and its associated 
                  IANA registration, the Selector ID 4739 was 
                  used with this PANA-L4.

                6 USER-Defined: The Selector ID represents 
                  applications defined by the user (using CLI, 
                  GUI, etc.) based on the methods described in 
                  section 2.  The Selector ID has a local 
                  significance per device.

               12 PANA-L2: Proprietary layer 2 (L2) definition.  
                  An enterprise can export its own layer 2 
                  identifiers.  The Selector ID represents the 
                  enterprise's unique global layer 2 
                  applications. The Selector ID has a global 
                  significance for all devices from the same 
                  enterprise. Examples include Cisco Subnetwork 
                  Access Protocol (SNAP). 
                 
               13 PANA-L7: Proprietary layer 7 definition. The 
                  Selector ID represents the enterprise's unique 
                  global ID for the layer 7 applications. The 
                  Selector ID has a global significance for all 
                  devices from the same enterprise. This 
                  Classification Engine Id is used when the 
                  application registry is owned by the Exporter 
                  manufacturer (referred to as the "enterprise" 
                  in this document).

               18 ETHERTYPE: The Selector ID represents the 
                  well-known Ethertype. See [ETHERTYPE]. Note 
                  that the Ethertype is usually expressed in

                  decimal value is used in this Selector ID. 
                 
               19 LLC: The Selector ID represents the well-known 
                  IEEE 802.2 Link Layer Control (LLC) 
                  Destination Service Access Point (DSAP). See 
                  [LLC]. Note that LLC DSAP is usually expressed 
                  in hexadecimal. However, the corresponding 
                  decimal value is used in this Selector ID. 
                 
               20 PANA-L7-PEN: Proprietary layer 7 definition, 
                  including a Private Enterprise Number (PEN) 
                  [PEN] to identify that the application 
                  registry being used is not owned by the 
                  Exporter manufacturer (referred to as the 
                  "enterprise" in this document, and identified 
                  by the PEN), or to identify the original 
                  enterprise in the case of a mediator or 3rd 
                  party device. The Selector ID represents the 
                  enterprise unique global ID for the layer 7 
                  applications. The Selector ID has a global 
                  significance for all devices from the same 
                  enterprise.
