Abstract

   This document describes a media type (application/xtm+xml) for
   serialization of Topic Maps into Extensible Markup Language (XML).
   Topic Maps is a technology for encoding knowledge and connecting this
   encoded knowledge to relevant information resources.  Topic maps are
   organized around topics, which represent subjects of discourse;
   associations, representing relationships between the subjects; and
   occurrences, which connect the subjects to pertinent information
   resources.  Topic Maps is an ISO standard (ISO 13250).

1.  Introduction

   Topic Maps is a technology for encoding knowledge and connecting this
   encoded knowledge to relevant information resources.  Topic Maps has
   a common structure defined by [ISO13250-2] that can be used for
   interoperable data interchange.

   Many formats exist for the interchange of Topic Maps, but ISO has
   defined the XTM syntax [ISO13250-3] as the main interchange syntax,
   in order to allow topic map to be serialized in an XML format.  The
   application/xtm+xml media type allows consumers of Topic Maps
   information to identify XTM documents so they can be processed
   properly.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  application/xtm+xml Registration

   This is a media type registration as defined in RFC 4288, "Media Type
   Specifications and Registration Procedures" [RFC4288].

   *MIME media type name:* application

   *MIME subtype name:* xtm+xml

   *Required parameters:* none

   *Optional parameters:* charset

   Same as charset parameter of application/xml, defined in RFC 3023
   [RFC3023].

   *Encoding considerations:* Same as encoding considerations of
   application/xml, defined in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

   *Security considerations:* See Section 5.

   *Interoperability considerations:* It is RECOMMENDED that XTM
   documents use the new XTM 2.0 syntax [ISO13250-3] as opposed to the
   older XTM 1.0 syntax [XTM1.0].  In general use of features of XML
   which XML processors may choose not to support should be avoided.

   ISO SC34 is currently developing XTM 2.1, which is backwards
   compatible with XTM 2.0.  When XTM 2.1 becomes a standard it is
   RECOMMENDED to use XTM 2.1 instead of XTM 2.0, despite 2.0 being a
   subset, as 2.1 is better suited to the interchange of fragments over
   the internet.

   *Published specification:* See the Topic Maps Data Model [ISO13250-2]
   and the XTM specification [ISO13250-3].

   *Applications which use this media type:* Any tool which can process
   or produce data according to the Topic Maps Data Model [ISO13250-2].
   This has included in the past generic Topic Maps tools, web portals,
   product configuration tools, e-learning systems, and a variety of web
   services and web service clients.

   *Magic number(s):* none

   Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently identify
   XTM, XTM documents will have the sequence
   "http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/" to identify the XTM namespace.  This
   will usually be near the top of the document.

3.  Fragment Identifiers

   The id attribute can be used to define fragments in an XTM document.
   So given an XTM document with the URL someurl the URL reference
   someurl#frag is taken to refer to the topic element in the XTM
   document whose id attribute value is "frag".  Such URLs commonly
   occur in XTM documents to refer to topics defined either in the same
   XTM document or a different XTM document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document calls for registration of a new MIME media type,
   according to the registration in Section 2.

5.  Security Considerations

   XTM is a generic format for exchanging application information, but
   application designers must not assume that it provides generic
   protection against security threats.  RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 10,
   discusses security concerns for generic XML, which are also
   applicable to XTM.

   XTM documents can be secured for integrity, authenticity and
   confidentiality using any of the mechanisms available for MIME and
   XML data, including XML signature, XML encryption, S/MIME, OpenPGP or
   transport or session level security (e.g., see [RFC3631], especially
   sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.10, [RFC2818], [RFC3275], [xmlenc-core]).

   XTM is intended to be used to combine information from disparate
   sources into a coherent whole, but it is entirely possible for
   sources outside the control of the receiver to provide information
   that is false, misleading, unclear, or inappropriately structured.
   The use of Topic Maps schemas may guard against inappropriate
   structure, but as far as the other concerns go, caution and careful
   engineering are required.

   XTM documents may contain references to other XTM documents via the
   mergeMap element, and XTM processors are required to dereference and
   process these references.  This can be a source of insecurity, by
   means either subtle or obvious, such denial of service attacks by
   automatically generated never-ending chains of mergeMap references or
   infinitely sized documents.
