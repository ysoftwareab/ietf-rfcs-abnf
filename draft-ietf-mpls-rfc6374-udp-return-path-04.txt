Internet-Draft           RFC6374 UDP Return Path             August 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document describes how Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for
   MPLS Networks protocol (MPLS-PLDM) [RFC6374] out-of-band responses
   can be delivered to the querier using UDP/IP.

   The use of UDP may be required to support data path management such
   as passage through firewalls, or to provide the necessary
   multiplexing needed in bistatic operation where the querier and the
   collector are not co-located and the collector is gathering the
   response information for a number of responders.  In a highly scaled
   system some MPLS-PLDM sessions may be off-loaded to a specific node
   within the distributed system that comprises the Label Switching
   Router (LSR) as a whole.  In such systems the response may arrive via
   any interface in the LSR and need to internally forwarded to the
   processor tasked with handling the particular MPLS-PLDM measurement.
   Currently the MPLS-PLDM protocol does not have any mechanism to
   deliver the PLDM Response message to particular node within a multi-
   CPU LSR.

   The procedure described in this specification describes how the
   querier requests delivery of the MPLS-PLDM response over IP to a
   dynamic UDP port.  It makes no other changes to the protocol and thus
   does not affect the case where the reponse is delivered over a MPLS
   Associated Channel [RFC5586].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Solution Overview

   This document specifies that, unless configured otherwise, if a UDP
   Return Object (URO) is present in a MPLS-PLDM Query, the responder
   MUST use the IP address and UDP port in the URO to reply back to the
   querier.  Multiple UROs MAY be present in a MPLS-PLDM Query
   indicating that an identical responses SHOULD be sent to each
   address-port pair.  A responder MAY be designed or configured to only
   transmit a single response, in which case the response MUST be sent
   using the parameters specified in the first URO in the query packet.

   The procedures defined in this document may be applied to both
   unidirectional and bidirectional LSPs.  In this document, the term
   bidirectional LSP includes the co-routed bidirectional LSP defined in
   [RFC3945] and the associated bidirectional LSP that is constructed
   from a pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction) that are

   associated with one another at the LSP's ingress/egress points
   [RFC5654].  The mechanisms defined in this document can apply to both
   IP/MPLS and to the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)[RFC5654],
   [RFC5921]

3.1.  UDP Return Object

   NOTE TO RFC Editor please delete the following paragraph before
   publication.

   START DELETE

   Note to reviewers - We considered a number of approaches to the
   design.  The first was to use the existing address object and a
   separate UDP object, but concern was expressed in the WG that there
   may be more than one collector that required this information, and
   the combined size of the two objects was large.  The next approach
   considered by the authors was to create a new object by appending a
   UDP port to the existing generalized address object.  However, noting
   that UDP is only likely to be sent over IP and that it will be a long
   time before we design a third major version of IP we can compress the
   object either by having separate IPv4 and IPv6 objects, or using the
   address length as the discriminator.  The object design below uses
   the latter approach.  The resultant combined UDP port + address
   object is thus the same size as the original address object.

   END DELETE

   The format of the UDP Return Object (URO) is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | URO TLV Type  | Length={6,18} |    UDP-Destination-Port       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                           Address                             ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The Type and Length fields are each 8 bits long.  The Length field
   indicates the size in bytes of the remainder of the object (i.e. is
   the size of the address in bytes plus 2).  When the address is IPv4
   the length field is thus 6 and when the address is IPv6 the length
   field is thus 18.  The length field therefore acts as both the TLV
   parsing parameter and the address family type indicator.

   The UDP Return Object Type (URO TLV Type) has a value of 131.

Internet-Draft           RFC6374 UDP Return Path             August 2015


   The UDP Destination Port is a UDP Destination port as specified in
   [RFC0768].

   The Address is either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.

   The URO MUST NOT appear in a response.

4.  Theory of Operation

   This document defines the UDP Return Object to enable the MPLS-PLDM
   querier to specify the return path for the MPLS-PLDM reply using IP/
   UDP encapsulation.

   When the MPLS-PLDM Response is requested out-of-band by setting the
   Control Code of the MPLS-PLDM query to "Out-of-band Response
   Requested", and the URO is present, the responder SHOULD send the
   response back to querier on the specified destination UDP port at the
   specified destination IP address contained in the URO.

   If the URO is expected but is not present in a query message and an
   MPLS-PLDM Response is requested out-of-band, the query message MUST
   NOT be processed further, and if possible an "Error - Invalid
   Message" ([RFC6374] Section 3.1) SHOULD be send to the querier and
   the operator notified via the management system (see Section 4.2 for
   further details.

4.1.  Sending an MPLS-PM Query

   When sending an MPLS-PLDM query message, in addition to the rules and
   procedures defined in [RFC6374]; the Control Code of the MPLS-PLDM
   query MUST be set to "Out-of-band Response Requested", and a URO MUST
   be carried in the MPLS-PLDM query message.

   If the querier uses the UDP port to de-multiplexing of the response
   for different measurement type, there MUST be a different UDP port
   for each measurement type (Delay, loss and delay-loss combined).

   An implementation MAY use multiple UDP ports for same measurement
   type to direct the response to the correct management process in the
   LSR.

4.2.  Receiving an MPLS PM Query Request

   The processing of MPLS-PLDM query messages as defined in [RFC6374]
   applies in this document.  In addition, when an MPLS-PLDM query
   message is received, with the control code of the MPLS-PLDM query set
   to "Out-of-band Response Requested" with a URO present, then the

Internet-Draft           RFC6374 UDP Return Path             August 2015


   responder SHOULD use that IP address and UDP port to send MPLS-PLDM
   response back to querier.

   If an Out-of-band response is requested and the Address object or the
   URO is missing, the query SHOULD be dropped in the case of a
   unidirectional LSP.  If both these TLVs are missing on a
   bidirectional LSP, the control code of Response message should set to
   0x1C indicating "Error - Invalid Message" ([RFC6374] Section 3.1) and
   the response SHOULD be sent over the reverse LSP.  The receipt of
   such a mal-formed request SHOULD be notified to the operator through
   the management system, taking the normal precautions with respect to
   the prevention of overload of the error reporting system.

4.3.  Sending an MPLS-PM Response

   As specified in [RFC6374] the MPLS-PLDM Response can be sent over
   either the reverse MPLS LSP for a bidirectional LSP or over an IP
   path.  It MUST NOT be sent other than in response to an MPLS-PLDM
   query message.

   When the requested return path is an IP forwarding path and this
   method is in use, the destination IP address and UDP port MUST be
   copied from the URO.  The source IP address and the source UDP Port
   of Response packet is left to discretion of the Responder subject to
   the normal management and security considerations.  The packet format
   for the MPLS-PLDM response after the UDP header is as specified in
   [RFC6374].  As shown in Figure 1 the Associate Channel Header (ACH)
   [RFC5586] is not included.  The information provided by the ACH is
   not needed since the correct binding between the query and response
   messages is achieved though the UDP Port and the session indentifier
   contained in the RFC6374 message.

                     Figure 1: Response packet Format

   If the return path is an IP path, only one-way delay or one-way loss
   measurement can be carried out.  In this case timestamps 3 and 4 MUST
   be zero as specified in [RFC6374].

4.4.  Receiving an MPLS-PM Response

   If the response was received over UDP/IP and an out-of-band response
   was expected, the Response message SHOULD be directed to the
   appropriate measurement process as determined by the destination UDP
   Port, and processed using the corresponding measurement type
   procedure specified in [RFC6374].

   If the Response was received over UDP/IP and an out-of-band response
   was not requested, that response should be dropped and the event
   SHOULD be notified to the operator through the management system,
   taking the normal precautions with respect to the prevention of
   overload of the error reporting system.

5.  Manageability Considerations

   The manageability considerations described in Section 7 of [RFC6374]
   are applicable to this specification.  Additional manageability
   considerations are noted within the elements of procedure of this
   document.

   Nothing in this document precludes the use of a configured UDP/IP
   return path in a deployment in which configuration is preferred to
   signalling.  In these circumstances the URO MAY be omitted from the
   MPLS-PLDM messages.

6.  Security Considerations

   The MPLS-PLDM system is not intended to be deployed on the public
   Internet.  It is intended for deployment in well managed private and
   service provider networks.  The security considerations described in
   Section 8 of [RFC6374] are applicable to this specification and the
   reader's attention is drawn to the last two paragraphs.
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access control lists and firewalls.

   There is no additional exposure of information to pervasive
   monitoring systems observing LSPs that are being monitored.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made an early allocation of a new Optional TLV type from
   MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object Registry contained within the
   Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters registry set.  IANA is
   requested to modify the description text as shown below.
