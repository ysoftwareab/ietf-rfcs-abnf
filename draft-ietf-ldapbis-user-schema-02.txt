Abstract

   This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object 
   classes defined by the ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T committees in the 
   IS0/IEC 9594 and X.500 documents, in particular those intended for 
   use by directory clients.  This is the most widely used schema for 
   LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema definitions for white 
   pages objects use it as a basis.  This document does not cover 
   attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, 
   nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWD].

1. General Issues

   This document references Syntaxes given in Section 3 of [SYNTAX] and 
   Matching Rules specified in Section 4 of [SYNTAX].

   The Attribute Type and Object Class definitions are written using the
   ABNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and ObjectClassDescription 
   given in [SYNTAX].  Lines have been folded for readability.


2. Source

   The schema definitions in this document are based on those found in 
   X.500 [X501], [X509], [X520], and [X521], specifically:

        Sections             Source

3. Attribute Types

   The Attribute Types contained in this section hold user information.

   An LDAP server implementation MUST recognize the objectClass 
   Attribute Type.

   There is no requirement that servers implement the following 
   Attribute Types: 

       knowledgeInformation
       searchGuide
       teletexTerminalIdentifier

   In fact, their use is greatly discouraged.

   An LDAP server implementation SHOULD recognize the rest of the 
   Attribute Types described in this section.

3.1  aliasedObjectName

   The aliasedObjectName Attribute Type is used by the directory 
   service if the entry containing this attribute is an alias.  In 
   X.501 [X501], this Attribute Type is called aliasedEntryName.

   ( 2.5.4.1 NAME 'aliasedObjectName' 
      EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 
      SINGLE-VALUE )

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the DN syntax.

3.2  businessCategory

   This Attribute Type describes the kind of business performed by 
   an organization.

   ( 2.5.4.15 NAME 'businessCategory' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{128} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Directory String syntax.

3.3  c

   This is the X.520 [X520] countryName Attribute Type, which contains 
   a two-letter ISO 3166 [Codes]country code.

   ( 2.5.4.6 NAME 'c' 
      SUP name 
      SINGLE-VALUE )

INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-02   27 February 2002


3.4  cn

   This is the X.520 [X520] commonName Attribute Type, which contains 
   a name of an object.  If the object corresponds to a person, it is 
   typically the person's full name.

   ( 2.5.4.3 NAME 'cn' 
      SUP name )

3.5  description

   This Attribute Type contains a human-readable description of 
   the object. 

   ( 2.5.4.13 NAME 'description' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{1024} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Directory String syntax.

3.6  destinationIndicator

   This attribute is used for the telegram service.

   ( 2.5.4.27 NAME 'destinationIndicator' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44{128} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Printable String syntax.

3.7  distinguishedName

   This Attribute Type is not used as the name of the object itself, 
   but it is instead a base type from which attributes with DN syntax 
   inherit.

   It is unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an 
   entry.  LDAP server implementations which do not support attribute 
   subtyping need not recognize this attribute in requests.  Client 
   implementations MUST NOT assume that LDAP servers are capable of 
   performing attribute subtyping.

   ( 2.5.4.49 NAME 'distinguishedName' 
      EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 )

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the DN syntax.

3.8  dnQualifier

   The dnQualifier Attribute Type specifies disambiguating information

4.16  top

   The top Object Class is the conceptual beginning of the inheritance 
   hierarchy of object classes.  Top guarantees that every entry has 
   the objectClass attribute, which identifies the type of the entry.

5.  Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive 
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws 
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the 
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

   It is required that strong authentication be performed in order to 
   modify directory entries using LDAP.

   Several X.500 Attribute Types and Object Classes, such as, the 
   userCertificate Attribute Type or the certificationAuthority Object 
   Class, are used to include key-based security information in 
   directory entries.  The Attribute Types are:  

      authorityRevocationList
      cACertificate
      certificateRevocationList
      crossCertificatePair
      deltaRevocationList
      supportedAlgorithms
      userCertificate

   The Object Classes are:

      certificationAuthority
      certificationAuthority-V2
      cRLDistributionPoint
      strongAuthenticationUser
      userSecurityInformation

   These Attribute Types and Object Classes are specified for LDAP by 
   the PKIX Working Group, and so, are not included in this document.

   The BNF notation in RFC 1778 [Syn String] for User Certificate, 
   Authority Revocation List, and Certificate Pair are not recommended 
   to be used.

                          Annex A  Change Log


   This annex lists the changes that have been made from RFC 2256 to 
   this I-D.  

   Changes to RFC 2256 resulting in 
   draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-00.txt:

      1.  Revision of the Status of this Memo.

      2.  Dependencies on RFC 1274 have been eliminated.

      3.  The references to X.500(96) have been expressed in terms of 
          the "edition", rather than the standard date.  Note that the 
          version of X.500 which is the basis for this document, is the 
          third edition, which was finalized in 1996, but approved in 
          1997.

      4.  The "teletexTerminalNumber" attribute and syntax are marked 
          as obsolete.

      5.  Removed "The syntax definitions are based on the ISODE "QUIPU"
          implementation of X.500." from section 6.

      6.  Added text to 6.1, the octetString syntax, in accordance 
          with X.520.

      7.  Some of the attribute types MUST be recognized by servers.  
          Also, several attributes are obsolete.  Therefore, the 
          various kinds of attribute types have been placed in separate 
          sections:

            - necessary for the directory to operate (section 3.1) 

            - for holding user information (section 3.2) 

            - superseded or withdrawn (section 3.3).  

      8.  Since "top" may be implicitly specified and  "alias" is not 
          abstract, the last sentence in the description of the 
          "objectClass" attribute type, section 3.1.1, has been deleted.
          The clause that preceded the deleted sentence has been 
          removed, also.

      9.  Add a description to the definition of the "telephoneNumber" 
          attribute type, section 3.2.17.

      10. Add text to mark the "teletexTerminalIdentifier" attribute 
          type as obsolete.

INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-02   27 February 2002


      11. Add a security consideration requiring strong authentication 
          in order to modify directory entries.

   Changes to draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-00.txt, resulting in draft-
   ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-01.txt:
 
      12. Delete the conformance requirement for subschema object 
          classes in favor of a statement in [SYNTAX].

      13. Add a Table of Contents

      14. Replace the term "obsolete" with "superseded or withdrawn" 

      15. Added explanations to many attributes.

      16. In the title, correct the X.500 reference to have the second 
          edition as the basis.

      17. Throughout this I-D, cleaned up whitespace in the BNF 
          definitions.

      18. Removed Section 4, Syntaxes, and Section 6, Matching Rules, 
          (moved to draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-01.txt).

      19. Reorganized Section 3, Attributes, to eliminate grouping 
          attributes according to conformance requirements.  Reordered 
          Section 3, Attributes, and Section 4, Object Classes, 
          alphabetically.

      20. Added an explanation for each object class.

   Changes to draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-01.txt, resulting in draft-
   ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-02.txt:
 
      21. Removed the certificate-related Attribute Types:  
             authorityRevocationList, 
             cACertificate, 
             certificateRevocationList, 
             crossCertificatePair, 
             deltaRevocationList, 
             supportedAlgorithms, and 
             userCertificate.

          Removed the certificate-related Object Classes:  
             certificationAuthority,
             certificationAuthority-V2,
             cRLDistributionPoint,
             strongAuthenticationUser, and
             userSecurityInformation

          Noted in the Security Considerations (Section 7) that they 
          are covered in PKIX WG documents.

      22. Removed the dmdName Attribute Type and dmd Object Class 
          because they are not in the version of X.500 which 
          is referenced.

      23. Removed embedded comments from the ABNF productions 
          throughout the document.

      24. Cleaned up the references;  adopted word instead of number 
          tags;  split Section 7 into normative and informative 
          subsections.
