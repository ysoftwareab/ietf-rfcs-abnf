Abstract

   In developing a solution for CDN Internetworking it is necessary to
   define and accommodate requirements for Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting.  Since the Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) working group is already focused

   on defining these requirements, this document attempts to leverage
   that work.  It contains the requirements that would have to be
   supported by a AAA service to formulate a solution for CDN peering.

Internet-Draft            CDI AAA Requirements                 June 2002


1. Introduction

   The initial model for the World Wide Web (WWW) was based on clients
   interacting with origin servers to request and receive content or
   services.  As the Web increased in scale this model proved unwieldy
   for several reasons and resulted in current industry efforts to build
   and operate Content Distribution Networks or CDNs.  The overall
   purpose of these CDNs is to create a scalable service that can meet
   aggregate client demand while improving the performance and quality
   of delivery.  With increased demand for CDN services a need has been
   generated for a mechanism for interconnecting or peering these
   systems.

   A typical CDN has relationships with publishers and provides them
   with accounting and access related information.  This information is
   typically provided in the form of aggregate or detailed log files.

   In addition, these CDNs typically collect accounting information to
   aid in operation, billing and SLA verification.  Since all accounting
   data is collected within the CDN's administrative domain there is no
   requirement for generalized systems or protocols.

   Peering or interconnecting these CDNs introduces the need to obtain
   similar accounting data from a foreign domain.  This requirement
   means that customers of a peered CDN service (publishers, clients,
   and CDNs) must now have a generalized or standard means of obtaining
   accounting information to support current as well as planned business
   models.  For example, the desire to implement business models such as
   "Pay Per View" may require that there exist a mechanism for
   authenticating and authorizing clients at a delivery point that lies
   in a foreign domain.

   This document is focused on describing requirements for the
   Accounting Peering System as described in [7]

   This document frames the requirements for the Accounting Peering
   System against the ongoing work of the AAA working group.  This was
   done because the authors realized that considerable effort has
   already been expended in identifying inter-domain trust models and
   accounting requirements within that working group.  Therefore, a
   conscious decision has been made to leverage that existing body of
   work before making additional proposals.  As such, this document
   relies heavily on RFC 2904 [1], RFC 2975 [2], and RFC 2977 [3].

   Since the concentration of this effort is to determine the
   requirements for CDN internetworking / peering, the accounting
   requirements within an individual CDN are largely ignored within this
   document.

Internet-Draft            CDI AAA Requirements                 June 2002


   The core actions and activities within the CDN-I domain is
   essentially enumerated as Content Injection, Content Distribution,
   Content Request, Content/Service Delivery, and Content Retrieval.
   These are the primary activities that need to be tracked and
   accounted.  Please refer architectural diagrams in [5], [6], and [7].

   This document focuses and details the requirements on the digital
   representation of the above activities, along with the means and
   mechanisms to exchange these representations between peering parties
   which have participated in the activity, and/or any other component
   in a secure and guaranteed manner.

   Requirements for the remaining CDI architectural elements, the
   Request Routing System, which is responsible for directing user
   agents to the distributed content, and the Distribution Peering
   Requirements for CDI, which is responsible for distributing content
   between a CDN and the elements that it, are detailed in [8], [9].

1.1 Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

2. Terminology

   This section introduces new terminology not already defined in < RFC
   2975 [2], RFC 2977 [3], or [5]

   CDN Service: An action that is directly or indirectly related to the
      act of moving content from publisher to consumer.

   Customer: A billable entity (typically a publisher, client or peered
      CDN) that agrees to exchange compensation for a CDN Service.

   Entitlement: A right to access a given CDN Service or content object
      typically provided to a customer by a provider.

   Flat Rate: Indicates there is no limit on the amount of CDN Service
      that a customer can consume during a Period.

   Percentile: Indicates that a CDN Service will be billed at a rate
      that is based on a multiplier (Usage Rate) times the Usage during
      the Period.

   Period: The duration for which the Usage counter or Entitlement is
      active.

   Provider: An entity that offers a CDN Service in exchange for
      Compensation.

   Unit Of Measure (UOM): Indicates how Usage should be tracked (i.e.
      minutes, seconds, bytes, etc).

   Usage: A counter that measures the access or use of a CDN Service by
      the Customer.

   Usage Rate: A per-unit cost associated with the Usage of a CDN
      Service.

   Pricing / Rating Tiers: Indicates the existence of a schedule against
      which Usage of a given CDN Service is tracked and billed.

   Work: This is the definition of an activity in which a CDN partakes
      by providing a specific function, role or service.  These
      activities are restricted to only those which involve the
      participation of peering entities outside the CDNs administrative
      domain.

   Tier: This is the conceptual enclosure of a specific function (such
      as accounting, settlement, rating, billing, invoicing, payment,
      provisioning etc) in the context of a layered / phased multi-

      function environment.

   CDR (Content Detail Record): This is the digital entity which capture
      the 'what', 'who', 'when', 'where', and 'how' of the work done.

3. Overview of Accounting Peering System

   The Accounting Peering system is responsible for the definition,
   generation and exchange of usage / consumption data entities (CDRs)
   which depict the activities and works performed, requested, and
   completed between peering CDNs, and any component internetworking
   with a CDN.  These CDRs typically will contain 'what work was done',
   'who did the work', 'when was the work done', 'how was the work
   done', 'Resources Used' etc.

     Figure 1: Accounting Peering System Components and Activities

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   The above diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the architectural entities
   which will internetwork with a CDN as well as the activities that
   transpire between any two peering entities .  Each activity is to be
   considered as discrete accountable events in their own right.  The
   arrows indicate the parties and roles involved in each activity as
   each activity has a source and destination role in the communications
   exchange (note : the arrows do not indicate who is generating /
   receiving the CDR )

   The model above allows for complex chaining and sequencing of
   activities which express the relationship of interoperations that a
   typical CDN will encounter.

   The core activities (as described above) that need to be accounted



Gilletti, et al.        Expires December 12, 2002               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            CDI AAA Requirements                 June 2002


   are ContentInjection, ContentDistribution, ContentRequest,
   ContentRetrieval, and ContentServiceDelivery.  The activities above
   cannot span multiple internetworking hops.

   Each independent piece of activity or work performed by/to  a CDN,
   can be transmitted and collected by any entity or instrumentation,
   which implements the Accounting-Peering System Interface(Acct-CPG).

   It is envisioned that each CDN would have an instrumentation platform
   which would detect or be informed of the activities described above.
   This platform or detection mechanism is not in-scope of Acct-CPG.

   A transport protocol would be used to exchange CDRs between an entity
   which generates a CDR, and an entity which receives a CDR.
   Presumably, the entity which is capable of detecting the activity
   will be the entity that generates the CDR to an entity interested in
   receiving the CDR.  The Acct-CPG interface will not specify which
   entity can, must, or should implement the Acct-CPG interface.

   Accounting systems in general will have to support the real-time
   occurrence of the above  mentioned activities.  That is when the
   activities do take place, the activity must be recorded and not lost.
   Reliability of recording accountable events/activities is required or
   otherwise the accounting infrastructure will be compromised.  However
   the Acct-CPG will not specify the mechanism to record the activities
   that have occurred, but will solely impress upon the necessity of
   reliability and integrity in the process of activity detection, and
   recording.

   The nature of certain activities may also span a segment of time from
   activity initiation to completion.  Acct-CPG systems shall be able to
   generate interim, and composite CDRs of each discrete activity which
   depict the passage of time and states of an activity.  Thus, the
   Acct-CPG interface  shall be charged with the responsibility of
   support for interim and composite CDRs, and support for real time
   and/or offline/batch exchange of accountable works / activities.

   The Accounting data entities (CDRs) may be used by other downstream
   functional tiers such as Rating & Billing, Capacity Planning,
   Performance & Monitoring Analysis, Payment systems, Account
   Management, Settlement Systems etc.  These downstream tiers are
   considered out-of-scope, but the solution should not be incompatible
   with this functionality

4. Assumptions

   Certain assumptions/expectations of the operating environment are
   detailed below.  Should any of the assumptions change, there may be
   material implications on the requirements of the CDN-I Accounting
   Peering (Acct-CPG) systems.

4.1 Firewalls

   There are no firewalls between the path of the Accounting Peering
   Systems.  Peering CDN-I Accounting systems can establish a
   communication channel between themselves provided they have the
   appropriate and valid trust credentials.

4.2 CDR Generation & Reception

   Any entity (network element or service element) can be a CDR
   Generator and/or a CDR Receiver as long as the entity is 'CDN-I Acct-
   CPG' enabled.

4.3 Storage Requirements

   The CDN-I Accounting Peering requirements shall not place any
   constraints or restrictions on the storage of CDRs.  CDR Storage is
   essentially out of scope.  However, to provide fail-over and recovery
   in the data exchange protocol, there most likely will be storage
   implications for an entity to be considered 'CDN-I Accounting
   Peering' enabled.

4.4 Authentication & Authorization

   The CDN-I Accounting Peering requirements shall only exchange
   Authentication & Authorization Messages to enable the exchange of
   CDRs.  The policies, and mechanisms which influence these
   Authentication and Authorizations messages are to be provided and
   maintained by an external functional component or process, and are to
   be considered out-of-scope, except to the extent that it influences
   the requirements of accounting data exchange.

4.5 Measurement / Metering Systems

   Instrumentation (hard and/or soft) exists on the CDN-I network which
   can detect, recognize, and inform an Accounting-Peering System when a
   ContentInjection, ContentDistribution, ContentRequest,
   ContentRetrieval, and ContentServiceDelivery act / event has taken
   place.

Internet-Draft            CDI AAA Requirements                 June 2002


4.6 Inter-Domain Trust

   All systems are conformant with the AAA Authentication and
   Authorization Framework for Inter-Domain trust.  Refer [1]

4.7 Proxy CDN-I Account-Peering systems

   If Accounting-Peering (Acct-CPG) system communicate through
   intermediate Acct-CPG systems, it is necessary that the CDR payload
   is secure between the originator Acct-CPG and target Acct-CPG server.
   The security requirement may be end-to-end security, CDR payload
   integrity, confidentiality, replay protection, and non-repudiation.
   Refer [1].

5. Accounting 'Works'

   The objective of this section is to define the requirement of a
   scalable framework for depicting all the various acts / services /
   'works' performed by any entity which internetworks with a CDN, and
   which needs to be accounted.  It is envisioned that a finite (core)
   set of works will need to be defined so as to achieve initial
   adoption and traction.  Thereafter the framework must accommodate
   expansion of acts / services / work in the CDN Internetworking
   domain.

5.1 Introduction

   An expression of 'work' performed consists of a collection/sequence
   of attributes which consist of identifiers, measures, and counters.
   The attributes serve to answer the who, what, where, and how of these
   elements of usage or acts of consumption (CDRs).

   For the CDN peering/interconnection scenario, it is important to
   construct the expressions/acts of consumption such that there is no
   dispute and ambiguity in meaning between parties producing and
   receiving these expressions.  In each act of consumption, there is a
   minimum set of attributes in which an act/expression of consumption/
   usage is considered "complete and indisputable" and therefore able to
   be used by any downstream tiers (ex : rating and billing).

5.2 General Requirements

5.2.1 Framework

   A framework which can accommodate the scalable definition of CDRs is
   required.  This framework shall be able to introduce new CDRs and
   their associated schemas at a later time frame.

   The framework must ensure that 'Context' of the CDR payload is
   available to any party such that domains / scope of CDR and attribute
   applicability / validity is defined.  'Context' will mean roles of
   participating entities, domain, and scope.  There shall be no
   overloading of attribute meanings.  Every measure and counter must
   have have units, minima and maxima, and incrementals defined.  Every
   identifier must be persistent within a defined domain and time frame.
   Decisions on in-band or out-of-band context embedding will be needed
   and shall be defined in the framework.  The framework shall support
   self-description of the usage attributes.

   This framework shall NOT define any actions, rules, constraints and
   context with regards to the processing of CDRs.

   XML technology should be considered as a vehicle to achieve the above
   framework.  Other strategies can also be considered if the end-value
   is achievable.

5.2.2 Form-Factor of CDRs

   The representation and form-factor of the CDRs must also be
   addressed.  Binary based and character based form factors need to be
   supported.

5.2.3 Timing Requirement of CDR exchange

   Certain CDRTypes will have delivery requirements which meet timing
   constraints.  For each independent operating scenario and 'work'
   (CDR) type, requirements on CDR transport exchange and timings need
   to be assessed.  It will be required to specify timing constraints
   for certain CDR Types, and will be used by the data exchange protocol
   during the channel setup phase.

5.2.4 Identifiers

   An identifier is an attribute which associates a name convention to
   an entity.  Examples of identifies are OrganizationName, EndUserName,
   Name of Movie, ContentID etc These identifiers can and do have
   properties and characteristics such as persistence, scope & domain,
   time-to-live etc.  In the accounting context, these identifiers must
   be resolvable, unambiguous, recoverable and unique in the applicable
   domain.

5.2.5 Measures

   Measures are attributes that help to describe 'how' a certain piece
   of work was performed, delivered or consumed.  Typical examples are
   QoS, JitterDelay, etc.  Measures need to be defined completely and
   without ambiguity by defining known minima, maxima, unit of
   increments etc.  The definition of measures must remain persistent
   and consistent within its scope and domain.

5.2.6 Counters

   Counters are attributes that help to describe the quantity of
   resources consumed by a singular accountable act / work.  Typically
   Counters must be defined by its units, minima and maxima and the
   mathematical operations that are permissible on a counter.

5.2.7 Name Space Convention (Distributed,Domained,Global)

   In a distributed environment, a domain consistent way of naming

Internet-Draft            CDI AAA Requirements                 June 2002


   entities such as a customer, ContentID, ContentType etc is required,
   so that any member participating in the CDN Internetworking
   activities can be consistently identified.  The scope / domain of
   applicability of every identifier must be referenceable by any party
   participating in the work represented by the specific CDR, and / or
   by any party involved in the exchange of the specific CDR.

   Likewise, the framework must also provision a Name Space mechanism
   for naming a specific content within the federation.  For example, a
   specific movie or song might need to be named in the same way in all
   of the different points of the federation, independently of the
   domain that is delivering the specific content.  This SHOULD follow a
   standard that can be interpreted by every member of the federation.

5.2.8 Security Requirements

   This document assumes that the solutions suggested within this
   document will be compliant with the trust model given in RFC 2904
   [1].

5.3 Core Works Requirements

   This section defines those 'work' items that form the initial core
   set of 'works' that must be supported by any 'CDN-I Accounting'
   enabled entity.  The objective here is to achieve consensus around a
   set of accountable works which are deemed sufficiently important such
   that its definition and support is warranted.

5.3.1 Introduction

   For each of the accountable works defined below in the subsections,
   the following must be defined :

5.3.1.1 List of Attributes

   Each attribute must define its name, its meaning, whether it is a
   required / optional / conditional attribute, its data type (int,
   string, complex etc)

5.3.1.2 Encoding and Representation

   The encoding and representation format of each attribute inside the
   CDR must be defined.

5.3.1.3 Use Case Model

   Generally describes the involved entities in the creation of the CDR.
   The 'Context' of the CDR will most likely be defined here as well.

Internet-Draft            CDI AAA Requirements                 June 2002


5.3.1.4 Work Flow Model

   Details the sequencing of events of the involved entities which
   generates the CDR and where the CDR has to be sent.

5.3.1.5 Work State Model

   Details the state transition diagram of the 'Work' by defining the
   triggers and the state of work from inception to completion.  The
   'State' of Work may or may not be distributed across one or more
   elements in the federation.

5.3.2 ContentInjection Work

   This 'work' is the event(CDR) that represents the act of a Host
   Origin Server which successfully 'injects' a piece of 'content' into
   a CDN for further distribution.  An example scenario is where a
   Content Provider or a Publisher wishes to distribute content.  The
   Publisher typically transfer the relevant content to a CDN Service
   Provider.  This transaction is referred to as Injection.

6. Data Exchange Mechanism / Protocol

6.1 Introduction

   This objective of this section is to develop the requirements of a
   transport mechanism which shall be responsible for the transfer /
   exchange of a 'Work/Activity' (CDR) from one entity to another
   entity.

6.2 General Requirements

   This section details some of the general requirements of a transport
   protocol.

6.2.1 Separation of Exchange Protocol from CDR payload

   The transfer protocol must be cleanly decoupled from the CDR payloads
   that it will transfer.

6.2.2 Transfer Capability Negotiation

   Support for push, pull and poll transfers modes need to be supported.

6.2.3 Singular, Batched, Flow, & RealTime Modes of Data Exchange

   The transport protocol shall support batch, flow, and real-time modes
   of exchange of CDR payloads.  Support for multiple channels of
   transport must exist to accommodate multiple varying throughput rate
   requirements, and/or multiple  exchange modes between the accounting
   peering parties which occur at the same time.  A specific transport
   channel shall be able to exchange multiple CDRs of a singular
   CDRType.  That is, mixed CDRTypes within a singular channel is not
   supported.

6.2.4 Efficient Encoding

6.2.5 Transfer Flow & Rate Control

   The transfer protocol shall support flow control mechanisms to
   achieve sustainable delivery throughput between the two data exchange
   peers.

6.2.6 Guaranteed Delivery

   It is to be assumed that all works that are to be accounted for MUST
   never be lost.  Therefore all transfer modes must achieve reliable
   and guaranteed delivery of CDR payloads.  Unless there is a
   compelling case for an non-guaranteed delivery requirement, this



Gilletti, et al.        Expires December 12, 2002              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft            CDI AAA Requirements                 June 2002


   assumption and requirement shall stand.

6.2.7 CDR Relationship Identifiers

   CDR EventIdentifiers (unique) may be required if relationships exist
   across a set of CDRs.  Situations where interim CDRs are generated,
   it is necessary to track the sequencing of a related set to ensure
   completeness, detect errors, and the retransmission of CDRs.  If
   relationships of a set of CDR spans a distributed domain, then a
   distributed numbering strategy must exist.

6.2.8 Protocol State Machines

   Clear visualization of transport protocol state machines in the
   sender and receiver must be developed.

6.2.9 Encryption

   It is recommended that encryption works from other IETF standards be
   leveraged to ensure data / CDR security.

6.3 Authorization and Authentication

   Authorization and authentication mechanisms must exist in the data
   exchange protocol to enable the initiation of data exchange.  This
   mechanism may be influenced by external (out-of-scope) policy and
   control mechanisms / processes which precede the transfer / exchange
   of CDRs.

6.4 CDR Receivers

   Any entity that is 'CDN-I Accounting' enabled is eligible to receive
   a CDR.  To enable the delivery of CDRs, the CDR Receiver must contact
   a CDR Generator and establish a channel.  A channel must only be able
   to transfer CDRs of a singular CDRType.

6.5 CDR Generators :

   Only 1 CDR must be generated for a singular incidence of 'work'.  Any
   entity which is 'CDN-I Accounting' enabled, is eligible to generate
   the CDR.  The CDR Generator entity must be able to support the
   delivery of a CDR stream to multiple recipients if a single channel
   has been created between each recipient and the CDR Generator.

6.6 Fault-Tolerance

   Fault Tolerance, fail-over, and recovery mechanism mechanisms are
   required to insure against network failure, accounting peering

8. Recommendations

   [Editor's Note: This section is here only to record some ideas that
   need to be discussed while this specification is being progressed.]

   One means of accommodating these types of services is to build off of
   the ongoing work of the IETF AAA working group [2].  At present this
   work is centered on the Diameter framework and protocol suite for
   both provisioning and accounting.  Early observations indicate that
   Diameter has several characteristics that are desirable for
   consideration in fulfilling these accounting requirements.  The high
   point characteristics are that it:

      Has a model that supports either direct aggregation to home
      provider 3rd party brokering.

      Has well developed security and trust relationships.

      Supports standardized, extensible accounting record format.

      Is generally extensible.

      Has hop-by-hop, as well as end-to-end encryption support.

9. Conclusion

   There is a considerable amount of work remaining in defining the
   accounting requirements and relationships.  As such, the authors
   welcome additional input from interested parties.
