Abstract

Currently Mobile  IP WG is carrying  out very interesting  work in the
area of Fast/Low latency handoffs for Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4. The
high  level goal  of this  work is  to reduce  the latency  during the
change  of point  of attachement  to the  Internet (AKA  Handoff) This
document discusses  one simple  case that in  the author's  opinion is
very common  and can be optimized  to achevie lower  latency than that
proposed by the various solutions.  This scenario applies to both IPv6
and  IPv4  work.  The solution  at  a  high  level  is the  same,  but
realization  will be  different  as the  frame  work in  IPv6 case  is
different from that of the IPv4 case.

1. Introduction

Currently Mobile  IP WG is carrying  out very interesting  work in the
area of Fast/Low latency handoffs for Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4. The
high  level goal  of this  work is  to reduce  the latency  during the
change  of point  of attachement  to the  Internet (AKA  Handoff) This
document discusses  one simple  case that in  the author's  opinion is
very common  and can be optimized  to achevie lower  latency than that
proposed by the various solutions.  This scenario applies to both IPv6
and  IPv4  work.  The solution  at  a  high  level  is the  same,  but
realization  will be  different  as the  frame  work in  IPv6 case  is
different from that of the IPv4 case.

2. Senario Description


When the mobile  moves from one AR to  another the following scenarios
can be envisioned in the break-before make case of handoff.

1. We can  predict the movement  in advnace (i.e. before  the handoff)
    and  enable   fast  handoff  as   described  in  [FMIPv6]   and  in
    PRE-REGISTRATION HANDOFF of FMIPv4.

2. We  can use L2  trigger information  intelligently as  specified in
    POST-REGISTRATION in FMIPv4 and in Extension to FMIPv6 in BETH.

There is a  scenario where it is not possible  to predict the movement
well ahead in advance and sufficient L2 Triggers are not avialable. In
this scenario  the mobile moves to  a new access router  would like to
affect  a fast  handoff.   The goal  of  this document  is to  suggest
solutions to  achenving this  handoff in a  least latency  fashion. An
example network  where in  such a scenario  occurs is Wireless  LAN or
802.11  based  network.  In  this  scenario,  and  in the  absense  of
appropriate L2  triggers, the handoff currently prescribed  is that of
one specified in Mobile IPv6 or Mobile IPv4.

3. Handoff for  IPv6

3.1 Problem

Currently in IPv6,  in the above described scenario,  the mobile needs
to obtain a  CoA using a stateless (obtain the  network prefix, form a
CoA,  perfom DAD)  or stateful  mechanisim. Then  perform  Mobile IPv6
procedures.  This will  incur latency  beyond what  is  acceptable for
realtime communicaiton.

3.2 Solution

There are several  possible implementations/realizations


Implementaion 1.

Other variations of implementations are possible.

extension to the current functionaly of the maeesages.

3.3 L2 Assumptions

3.4 Issues:

3.4.1 How to  determine the IP/MAC address of  the nFA?

3.4.2 Movement detection

3.4.3 Ingress Filterning

3.4.4 Security

3.5 Benifits

3.6 Buffering

3.7 Bicasting


4. Solution in IPv4

4.1 Problem

With the fast handoff soltions  that have been proposed in FMIPv4. The
mobile has to perform Mobile  IP registration. Which incurs latency as
discussed earlier.

4.2 Solution

In this case too there There are several possible implementations. One
such implementaion is:



                      +-----+ 2.Handoff Request* +-----+
                      |     | <----------------- |     |

                      |     | 3.Handoff Reply*   |     |
                      +-----+ -----------------> +-----+
                                                   ^  |
                                   1. Reg Request* |  | 4. Reg Reply*
                                                   |  v
                      +-----+    Movement        +-----+
                      | MN  | - - - - - - - - -> | MN  |
                      +-----+                    +-----+

#From the figure it looks like  a re-ordering of the messages. But this
#is actually more than than


Other variations of implementations are possible.
