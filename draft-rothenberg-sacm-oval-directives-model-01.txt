1.  Introduction

   The Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) [OVAL-WEBSITE]
   is an international, information security community effort to
   standardize how to assess and report upon the machine state of
   systems.  For over ten years, OVAL has been developed in
   collaboration with any and all interested parties to promote open and
   publicly available security content and to standardize the
   representation of this information across the entire spectrum of
   security tools and services.

   OVAL provides an established framework for making assertions about a
   system's state by standardizing the three main steps of the
   assessment process: representing the current machine state; analyzing
   the system for the presence of the specified machine state; and
   representing the results of the assessment which facilitates
   collaboration and information sharing among the information security
   community and interoperability among tools.

   This draft is the part of the OVAL contribution to the IETF SACM WG
   that standardizes the representation of the results of an assessment.
   It is intended to serve as a starting point for the endpoint posture
   assessment data modeling needs of SACM specifically a capability to
   specify the level of detail in Evaluation Results.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  OVAL Directives Model

   The OVAL Directives Model is used to control what result information
   is included in the OVAL Results as well as specify its level of
   detail.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank DHS for sponsoring the OVAL effort over the
   years which has made this work possible.  The authors also wish to
   thank the original authors of this document Jonathan Baker, Matthew
   Hansbury, and Daniel Haynes of the MITRE Corporation as well as the
   OVAL Community for its assistance in contributing and reviewing the
   original document.  The authors would also like to acknowledge Dave
   Waltermire of NIST for his contribution to the development of the
   original document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   While OVAL is just a set of data models and does not directly
   introduce security concerns, it does provide a mechanism by which to
   represent endpoint posture assessment information.  This information
   could be extremely valuable to an attacker allowing them to learn
   about very sensitive information including, but, not limited to:
   security policies, systems on the network, criticality of systems,
   software and hardware inventory, patch levels, user accounts and much
   more.  To address this concern, all endpoint posture assessment
   information should be protected while in transit and at rest.
   Furthermore, it should only be shared with parties that are
   authorized to receive it.

   Another possible security concern is due to the fact that content
   expressed as OVAL has the ability to impact how a security tool
   operates.  For example, content may instruct a tool to collect
   certain information off a system or may be used to drive follow-up
   actions like remediation.  As a result, it is important for security
   tools to ensure that they are obtaining OVAL content from a trusted
   source, that it has not been modified in transit, and that proper
   validation is performed in order to ensure it does not contain
   malicious data.
