Intended status: BCP

            Updating the Definition of Term for IAOC Members
                    draft-bradner-iaoc-terms-03.txt

Abstract

   The start and end dates specified in BCP 101 for terms of IAOC
   members has proven to be impractical.  This memo updates BCP 101 to
   establish that the IAOC is directed to establish start and end dates
   for terms of IAOC members that will be more practical.

Internet-Draft                 IAOC Terms                    August 2015


1. Background

   BCP 101 says "IAOC terms normally end at the end of the first IETF
   meeting of a year". ([RFC4071] Section 4.)  Having the terms of the
   IAOC members expire at the end of the first IETF meeting of the year
   has proved impractical for the IAOC to carry out its business and to
   elect its Chair during the meeting week.  For a number of years, the
   IAOC has fudged the issue somewhat by defaulting to an informal
   process of having the transition occur during the administrative
   plenary (as the IESG does). This informal arrangement violates the
   letter of BCP 101.  But even this arrangement is problematic if the
   transfer happens after the IAOC's face-to-face meeting that happens
   during the week. For a number of years, the IAOC's meeting has been
   on the morning of the administrative plenary so the incoming IAOC
   members, while present, are not seated even with the informal
   arrangement.

   Having the new IAOC members take office after the face-to-face
   meeting has caused difficulties in the chair selection and voting
   processes during the IAOC's face-to-face meeting held during the same
   week. There has been confusion over who should vote in the chair
   election and on any business actions that require a vote of the
   Trustees. If the incoming members are not seated then they should not
   vote, for example, to select a chair for the next year yet they, more
   than the outgoing members, should have a say in the chair selection.
   There is also confusion over who is eligible to be elected as chair -
   if the term of an IAOC member has not yet started could that IAOC
   member be elected chair (since the chair is selected from among the
   members).  Having the terms expire at the end of the week also risks
   the IAOC not being able to raise a quorum if outgoing members decide
   to not come to the meeting.  Since the IAOC members are the Trustees
   of the IETF Trust the same issues arise with the IETF Trust and its
   ability to carry out its business and elect a Chair during the
   meeting week

   An additional issue with BCP 101 is the current definition of the
   term of the IAOC Chair.  BCP 101 says "The term of the IAOC chair
   shall be one year from the time of selection or the remaining time of
   his or her tenure on the IAOC, whichever is less".  Since the dates
   for the first IETF meeting of the year vary from year to year the
   current BCP 101 text could result in there being no IAOC chair in
   weeks before the a meeting or in overlapping terms for IAOC Chairs.

2. BCP 101 Update

   This memo updates Section 4 of BCP 101 to remove the sentence
   defining when IOAC member terms end and to add the following
   requirements:

Internet-Draft                 IAOC Terms                    August 2015


   1. that the IAOC and the IETF Trust each hold a regular meeting
      around the time of the first IETF meeting of the year; and

   2. that the IAOC and the Trust select their chairs as the first order
      of business in their individual meetings in a manner of their
      choosing; and

   3. that the IAOC determine the beginning and end of the normal terms
      of its members relative to the above mentioned IAOC meeting,
      unless those determinations are made by the appointing bodies.

   A regular meeting has proper notice, with minutes posted, and may be
   held as face-to-face, teleconference, or as a combination of the two.

3. Security Considerations

   This memo relates to IETF process, not any particular technology so
   it does not impact the security of the Internet.
