     Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Registration Transition
                 draft-ietf-urnbis-ns-reg-transition-07

Abstract

   The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement
   discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems
   that could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed
   by RFC 8141, which adopts a different model, focusing on encouraging
   registration and publication of information for all appropriate
   namespaces.  This document clarifies that status of relevant older
   RFCs and advises IANA about selected existing registrations.

1.  Introduction

   As a part of the initial development of the Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) system in the late 1990s, the IETF URN working group agreed
   that it was important to demonstrate that the URN syntax can
   accommodate existing identifier systems.  RFC 2288 [RFC2288] proved
   the feasibility of using International Standard Book Number (ISBN),
   International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), and Serial Item and
   Contribution Identifier (SICI) [ANSI-SICI]) as URNs; however, it did
   not formally register corresponding URN namespaces.  This was in part
   due to the still evolving process to formalize criteria for namespace
   definition documents and registration, consolidated later in the IETF
   into successive Namespace Definition Mechanism documents [RFC2611]
   [RFC3406].

   URN Namespaces have subsequently been registered for ISBN and ISSN as
   well as for a fairly large collection of other identifiers including
   National Bibliography Number (NBN) [RFC3188].  The comprehensive list

   can be found in the IANA registry [IANA-Namespace-Registry] (see also
   Section 4).

   While a URN namespace for SICI could be registered at any time, the
   standard has not gained broad international acceptance and has not
   had a namespace defined to date.

   The predecessor registration procedure for Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) namespaces [RFC3406] required IETF Consensus for formal
   namespaces.  That requirement discouraged some registrations and
   increased the risk for problems, including use of names without
   registration ("squatting"), that could occur as a result.  Those
   potential problems included the possibility of the same name being
   used to identify different namespaces with different rules.  The
   requirements have now been changed in RFC 8141 [RFC8141] to adopt a
   different model that focuses more on encouraging registration of all
   namespaces that follow the formal namespace syntax, with as much
   information collected as possible consistent with that goal.

   Therefore this document does the following:

   o  Specifies IANA instructions to adapt selected existing
      registrations to the new model.

   o  Obsoletes the separate RFCs that specify the namespaces for ISSNs
      and ISBNs to eliminate any ambiguity about the status of new
      templates and updated registrations.

   o  Provides information about the status of NBNs under the
      definitions.

   o  Provides suggestions to IANA about the handling of other existing
      registrations not explicitly mentioned herein.

2.  Obsoleting Older Registration RFCs for ISSNs and ISBNs

   The existing RFCs that describe URN namespaces for ISSNs (RFC 3044)
   and ISBNs (RFC 3187) should be identified as "Historic" after this
   document is approved and immediately after the new registration
   templates for those namespaces are submitted and incorporated into
   the URN Namespace registry by IANA.

   The updated templates reflect not only new template formats but
   substantive changes to the definitions of the namespaces.  The
   changes are summarized in the subsections that follow.

   For both ISSN and ISBN URNs, it is intended that the registrations
   track the evolution of ISO standardization without requiring

Internet-Draft         URN Registration Transition              May 2017


   resubmission of the templates or other formal IETF or IANA
   registration update approval procedures.  The subsections that follow
   clarify the relationship between the original URN namespace
   registrations for ISBN and ISSN and new templates being registered
   that follow the principles of RFC 8141.  Approval and registration of
   those new templates makes the older templates obsolete and RFCs 3044
   and 3187 Historic.

2.1.  ISBN URN Changes

   The revised ISBN namespace reflects the latest version of the ISO
   ISBN Standard, ISO 2108:2017 [ISO-ISBN-b].  The namespace allows for
   the use of both the old ten character ISBN numbers described in RFC
   3187 and ISO 2108:1992 [ISO-ISBN-a] (formerly known as ISBN-10) and
   the 13 character identifiers introduced in ISO 2108:2005 [ISO-ISBN-c]
   (formerly known as ISBN-13).

   For information and help in understanding other parts of this
   document, review the new ISBN registration template [ISBN-Template].

2.2.  ISSN URN Changes

   The updated ISSN namespace reflects the changes between the current
   ISSN standard [ISO-ISSN] and its predecessor on which RFC 3044 was
   based.  ISO 3297:2007 introduced the linking ISSN (ISSN-L), which is
   designated for all media of a serial publication, irrespective of how
   many there are.  Traditional ISSN applies to single media only, such
   as printed version of a serial.

   For information and help in understanding other parts of this
   document, review the new ISSN registration template [ISSN-Template].

3.  Obsoleting older registration RFC for NBNs

   NBN is not a formal international standard or even a single
   identifier system, but an umbrella concept which covers all
   identifier systems the national libraries and their partners use to
   identify resources which do not have other identifier.  For instance,
   if a book received via legal deposit does not have an ISBN, the
   national library gives it a local identifier.  NBN specification
   provides simple means of expressing these local identifiers so that
   they become globally unique URNs, such as urn:nbn:fi-fe19981001.

   In addition to the namespace registration itself, RFC 3188 provides
   some generic information about NBNs and their use, and specifies the
   syntax of URN:NBNs which guarantees uniqueness by requiring the usage
   of country codes and institutional identifiers as a part of the NSS.

Internet-Draft         URN Registration Transition              May 2017


   When RFC 3188 is revised, it should be accompanied with a template
   which revises the registration of the URN:NBN namespace.

4.  Other existing URN registrations and RFCs

   The RFC Series and IANA Registry contain many URN namespace
   registrations in addition to those for which this document calls out
   explicit actions.  In general, those existing registrations are still
   appropriate but omit some information called for in RFC 8141
   [RFC8141].  Reregistration with new templates is recommended, but not
   required.  Until and unless those registrations are updated as
   provided for in RFC 8141, the existing registration templates should
   be read as not requiring or allowing any features that were not
   allowed and specified by the earlier URN [RFC2141] and registration
   [RFC3406] specifications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the registry entries for URN ISSN, ISBN,
   and NBN namespaces to reflect the new, RFC 8141-compliant templates
   as soon as they are available and to no longer reference the now-
   historic RFCs.  With respect to namespaces other than those listed
   above, registrations and templates conforming to the newer rules may
   be substituted for the older ones when they are available.  However,
   neither this document nor RFC 8141 supersedes existing registrations
   other than those listed above.  Therefore, IANA needs to be prepared
   to maintain a registry whose contents reflect old-style templates for
   some namespaces (including, temporarily, those for ISBN and ISSN
   ones) and the newer ones for others.

   IANA should also note that the portions of the registrations that
   point to ISO Standards are intended to identify current versions
   (which may change) rather than only the versions that are active at
   the time this document is approved (see Section 2).

6.  Security Considerations

   While particular URN namespaces and their registrations might
   conceivably have security implications, this specification merely
   specifies a transition of a set of namespace registrations and does
   not have such implications.  The security implications associated
   with particular namespaces are expected to be listed in registration
   templates as specified in RFC 8141.

7.  Acknowledgements

   This document draws heavily on discussions in the IETF URNbis Working
   Group in the second and third quarters of 2013, particularly during
   IETF 87 in August 2013, and on informal discussions during the
   plenary meeting of ISO TC 46 in June 2013.  The efforts of those who
   participated in those discussions are greatly appreciated.  It also
   draws on internet-drafts that were developed to update the older
   registrations before that approach was replaced by the new extended
   template model.  Those drafts were prepared by Pierre Godefroy, Juha
   Hakala, Alfred Hoenes, and Maarit Huttunen.

   The current draft benefits significantly from a careful reading and
   suggestions for editorial changes by Peter Saint-Andre and from
   considerable work by Stella Griffiths of the ISBN international
   Centre to refine the ISBN discussion and from Pierre Godefroy and
   Clement Oury of the ISSN International Centre for similar refinements
   of the ISSN discussion.
   [[CREF1: RFC Editor and IANA: Please note that "Centre" is the
   correct spelling of the names of those bodies.  If you want to spell
   out the names, use "International Standard Book Number" and
   "International Standard Series Number" although the abbreviations are
   well-known internationally.  And M.  Oury's first name is properly
   spelled with an acute accent over the initial "e", i.e., with U+00E9
   should things be far enough along for you to use that information.]]

      replacments.

   o  Many editorial changes to improve readability and clarity.

A.2.  Changes from version -01 to -02

   o  Several small editorial changes and clarifications suggested by
      Peter Saint-Andre.

   o  Updated acknowledgments.

A.3.  Changes from version -02 to -03

   o  Updated to prevent expiration

   o  New text to allow for other already-registered namespaces and to
      better explain relationships.

   o  Some small editorial changes.

A.4.  Changes from version -03 to -04

   o  Updated references and, where needed, discussion to point to the
      new, consolidated, 2141bis rather than to the formerly separate
      and now obsolete 3406bis.

   o  Some small editorial changes.

A.5.  Changes from version -04 to -05

   o  Reissued to keep draft alive; no substantive changes.

   o  Updated references.

A.6.  Changes from version -05 to -06

   o  Reissued to keep draft alive; some editorial updates but no
      substantive changes.

   o  Updated references.

A.7.  Changes from version -06 (2016-02-07) to -07 (2017-05-09)

   o  Removed old CREFs.  Added a new one, but only as a forward-looking
      note to the RFC Editor.

   o  Moved expansions of ISBN, ISSN, SICI, and NBN to the first uses of
      those terms, after which the abbreviations are used exclusively.

   o  Removed text that made promises about the content and schedule for
      RFC 3188bis.

   o  Rewrote or removed several paragraphs that seemed to confuse the
      status of various documents and registrations.

   o  Added a cross-reference and additional detail for existing
      registrations not specifically discussed in this document.

Internet-Draft         URN Registration Transition              May 2017


   o  Modified the IANA Considerations section to improve clarity and
      remove references to the expected template appendices.  Because
      RFC 8141 (2141bis) has been published and the new registration
      procedures are in effect, there is presumably no reason to add
      length and confusion to this document by including preliminary
      versions of those templates.

   o  Updated references, including the reference to the recently-
      published RFC 8141 (aka 2141bis).

   o  Added placeholder references for the registrations of the new IANA
      templates.

   o  Corrected minor typographical errors.
