1.  Introduction

   Network Slicing enables deployment and management of services with
   diverse requirements on end-to-end partitioned virtual networks over
   the same infrastructure, including networking, compute and storage
   resources.  [I-D.geng-coms-problem-statement] describes a problem
   statement for supervised heterogeneous network slicing, enabling
   users to deploy network slices including connectivity, computing and
   storage components.

   A resource-aware information model is currently being defined in
   [I-D.qiang-coms-netslicing-information-model] to represent network
   slices.  Nevertheless, defining and managing a network slice (NS)
   end-to-end does not always have to be done directly.  It may be
   convenient to define and manage separately subsets of an end-to-end
   slice.  The concept of network slice subnet is defined originally in
   [NGMN_Network_Slicing] for 5G, though we only need to retain its
   definition in the most universal form: network slice subnets are
   similar to network slices in most ways but cannot be operated in
   isolation as a complete network slice.  They can however be
   interconnected with other NS subnets to form a complete, end-to-end
   network slice (i.e. interconnection and/or stitching of NS subnets).
   To summarize: a NS subnet can be seen as a network slice with
   unconnected links.  The term "network slice segment" has also
   occasionally been used to designate a similar concept.

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                January 2018


   This document aims to augment the base COMS model to help manage
   interconnections between NS subnets.  The base COMS model can be used
   to represent an end-to-end network slice.  The extensions described
   in this document can be used to represent a slice subnet instead, and
   can also be used to represent an interconnection inside an end-to-end
   slice, i.e.  they aim to represent interconnection points both
   "before" and "after" the interconnection takes place.  Operations
   such as stitching subnets will also be described.  The base model is
   not technology specific, and therefore the description of
   interconnections should not be either.  Some interconnections may be
   implemented using gateways in the data plane.
   [I-D.homma-coms-slice-gateway] aims to describe the requirements on
   such data plane network elements, and will provide input for the
   management plane mechanisms described in the present document.

1.1.  Usage of NS Subnets

   Using NS subnets can help:

   o  Isolate management and maintenance of different portions of a
      network slice, over multiple infrastructure domains, or even
      within a single domain.  For example, in Figure 1, NS orchestrator
      (NSO) 2 manages subnet A, in isolation from subnets B and C
      managed by NSO 3.  NSO 1 can still manage the end-to-end slice as
      a whole, but it does not need to deal in detail with each subnet.

   o  Isolate mapping towards different infrastructure technologies,
      even within the same domain.  This can simplify NS orchestrator
      implementation, since each NSO can specialize in managing a
      smaller set of technologies.

   o  Enable advanced functions such as sharing a slice subnet between
      several slices, or substituting one slice subnet for another, e.g.
      for coping with load.

        Figure 1: Overview of Network Slice Subnets Interconnection

   Figure 1 illustrates how an end-to-end network slice may be composed
   of multiple slice subnets, each managed independently by a same or
   different NSO.  In multi-administrative domain scenarios, using NS
   subnets can help limiting the information that needs to be shared
   between domains.  At the infrastructure layer (i.e. in the data
   plane), the interconnection between NS subnets may involve:

   o  a gateway, that performs protocol and/or identifier/label
      translation as needed,

   o  two gateways, especially in cases where interconnected NS subnets
      are in different administrative domains,

   o  nothing at all, in cases where the interconnection point can be
      abstracted away, e.g.  when the NS subnets share a common
      infrastructure.  In this case nodes from both NS subnets end up
      being directly interconnected between each other.

1.2.  Terminology

   Network slicing related terminology used in this document should be
   interpreted as described in [I-D.geng-coms-problem-statement].

   Network Slice Subnet (NS subnet): a network system comprised of
   groups of connectivity, compute and storage resources, possibly
   including network functions and network management entities, forming
   a complete instantiated logical/physical network in support of
   certain network and service characteristics.  A network slice subnet
   cannot be activated in isolation as an overall (end-to-end) network
   slice, but must be interconnected with other slice subnets to form
   one.

   NS Stitching: a management operation consisting in creating an end-
   to-end NS or a larger NS subnet, by interconnecting a set of NS
   subnets together.

   Interconnection Anchor: a management plane entity, part of a NS
   subnet model, representing an end point for use in future stitching
   operation.

   Interconnection Instance (or Interconnect): a management plane
   entity, part of a NS subnet model, representing an interconnection
   realized by a stitching operation.  It is distinct from a (data
   plane) gateway: an interconnect may be realized with or without using
   a gateway in the data plane.

2.  Information Model

2.1.  Base Information Model

   The information model we use as base for network slicing is currently
   being defined in [I-D.qiang-coms-netslicing-information-model].  It
   is itself based on the network topology model ietf-network defined in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo], in which networks are composed of
   nodes and links, and in which termination points (TP), defined in
   nodes, are used to define source and destination of links.

   A network slice data model instance, i.e. a "network" attribute of
   the "ietf-network" model augmented using
   [I-D.qiang-coms-netslicing-information-model]), represents a network
   slice.  When such a data model instance includes at least an
   "interconnection anchor", as defined below, it represents a network
   slice subnet instance.

   At high level, the extensions defined in this document will augment
   nodes and termination points:

         |  |  ... (augmented with attributes for
         |  |       anchor/interconnection TP)

2.2.  Interconnection Anchors

   To represent an anchor point for future interconnections (i.e. an
   unconnected end of a link), a simple solution is to use an
   "interconnection anchor" termination point (or anchor TP).  Within
   the data model describing a subnet, any link not entirely contained
   within the NS subnet must be terminated with such an anchor TP as
   source or destination.  An anchor TP belongs to a "node" attribute,
   which we refer to as interconnection anchor node (or anchor node).
   Anchor nodes should not include non-anchor TP or serve other non-
   anchor related purposes (e.g. should not include any compute or
   storage unit), in order to simplify the stitching operation.  For
   example, it will be easier to handle the case where the
   interconnection anchors are abstracted away during a stitching
   operation.  Several anchor TPs can be grouped together in an anchor
   node, and such grouping may be used as a hint during a stitching
   operation (e.g. to place all interconnection points at a same
   location).

   As described in Figure 2, we represent a network slice subnet as a
   network slice that also has one or more anchor nodes, which terminate
   (at anchor TPs) links that need to be interconnected with external
   nodes (cross-subnet links).

   o  Information enabling NS orchestrators to match anchor nodes and
      TPs from both NS during a stitching operation.  A label may be a
      simple way to enable this.

   o  Information to help locate the interconnection.  For example, it
      could be a (sub-)domain name or geo-location information, that
      indicates where the interconnection point should be located.  This
      can help for example in cases where the subnet is instantiated
      before stitching.

   o  Information to help select the type of interconnection
      establishment: for example, this can indicate a preference for
      using interconnection over a gateway, or for abstracting away the
      interconnection point in the infrastructure plane.

2.3.  Interconnection Instances

   There are two options for representing post-stitching network slices
   (or subnets).  They are not mutually exclusive:

   o  Option 1: subnet data models are updated with information
      describing the interconnection (e.g. anchor TPs and nodes are
      updated with new attributes representing the existing connection,
      if necessary).

   o  Option 2: a new data model is generated to represent the resulting
      network slice (or subnet).  In this merge data model, the
      interconnection may or may not be represented, this can be a
      choice made by the operator.

   Option 1 and 2 can be used concurrently in a network.  For example, a
   parent NS orchestrator may manage stitched NS subnets through
   underlying NS orchestrators, and at the same time expose to the NS
   operator a merged data model representing the resulting end-to-end
   slice.

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                January 2018


   To represent an existing interconnection in option 1, a simple
   solution is to add attributes to existing anchor nodes and anchor
   TPs.  Those attributes will be described below.  They aim to describe
   state and configuration associated with an active interconnection.

   To represent an existing interconnection in option 2, a simple
   solution is to create new interconnection instance nodes and
   termination point.  The same attributes as in option 1 may be
   associated with these nodes and TPs.

   Attributes of interconnection instance nodes and termination points
   include:

   o  State information (interconnection type, status, location...).

   o  Service assurance related information: besides measurements (on
      throughput, loss rate, etc.), triggers depending on throughput,
      latency, etc. can be linked with a management action or event.  A
      NS operator can use such events to take the decision to disable a
      NS subnet, replace a NS subnet with another, etc. to maintain
      overall service performance.

2.4.  Stitching Operation

   Stitching may occur when network slice subnets are initially
   instantiated, or later after instantiation.  This operation may
   involve 2 or more NS subnets.

   A first part of the operation is to identify which anchor TPs (i.e.
   which links) to interconnect to each other.  This matching should be
   dictated by the design of each NS subnets.  Attributes should be
   present in anchor TPs to enable automatic matching without human
   intervention at the time of stitching.  Interconnected links need to
   have compatible QoS attributes.

3.  Security Considerations

   Access control mechanisms for managing network slices can likely be
   reused for network slice subnets, since their models should be
   similar to each other.

   Stitching 2 NS subnets together may be subject to some form of
   authorization by a NS tenant.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
