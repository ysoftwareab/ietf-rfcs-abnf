Internet-Draft   Email Properties Reputation Vocabulary        June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a "vocabulary" for describing reputation of a
   property of an email message that is not an identity.  A "vocabulary"
   in this context is defined in [RFCxxxx] and is used to describe
   assertions a reputation service provider can make about properties of
   an email message as well as meta-data that can be included in such a
   reply beyond the base set specified there.

   A separate document in this series declares a vocabulary for use in
   relating reputation information about an identity found in an email
   message.


2.  Document Series

   This memo represents the media type registration, part of a series of
   documents that define the overall service and introduce the initial
   exemplary applications.  The series is as follows:

   1.  RFCxxxx: A Model for Reputation Interchange

   2.  RFCxxxx+1: A Media Type for Reputation Information

   3.  RFCxxxx+2: Using UDP for Reputation Interchange

   4.  RFCxxxx+3: Using the DNS for Reputation Interchange

   5.  RFCxxxx+4: Using HTTP/XML for Reputation Interchange

   6.  RFCxxxx+5: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Identity Reputation

   7.  RFCxxxx+6: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Property Reputation
       (this memo)


3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

3.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

Internet-Draft   Email Properties Reputation Vocabulary        June 2011


3.2.  Email Definitions

   Commonly used definitions describing entities in the email
   architecture are defined and discussed in [EMAIL-ARCH].

3.3.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this memo are defined in RFCxxxx, the
   base memo in this document series.


4.  Discussion

   The expression of reputation about an email property requires
   extensions of the base set defined in [RFCxxxx].  This memo defines
   and registers some common assertions about an entity found in a piece
   of [MAIL].

   Unless otherwise noted, the property extracted from the message MUST
   be preserved precisely, with no characters omitted even if they are
   considered syntax errors within context.

4.1.  Assertions

   The "email" reputation application recognizes the following
   assertions:

   CONTAINS-MALWARE:  The subject property is associated with messages
      that contain malware

   IS-PHISH:  The subject property is associated with fraudulent email
      with a goal of identity theft

   IS-SPAM:  The subject property is associated with unwanted bulk email

4.2.  Vocabulary Extensions

   The "email-content" reputation application recognizes the following
   extensions to the vocabulary defined in [RFCxxxx]:

   SOURCE:  A token indicating the source of the property; that is,
      where the subject property was found in the message.  This MUST be
      one of:

      RFC5321.MAILFROM:  The RFC5321.MailFrom value of the envelope of a
         message of the message (see [SMTP])

      RFC5322.FROM:  The RFC5322.From field of the message (see [MAIL]).
         Any folding whitespace MUST be rewritten to a single linear
         space character (ASCII 32).

      RFC5322.MESSAGE-ID:  The RFC5322.Message-Id field of the message
         (see [MAIL])

      RFC5322.SUBJECT:  The RFC5322.Subject field of the message (see
         [MAIL]).  Any folding whitespace MUST be rewritten to a single
         linear space character (ASCII 32).

      UNSPECIFIED:  Any arbitrary string from anywhere in the message.

      URI:  A complete URI found in the message, such as the content of
         a "src" tag in an "img" element, or an "href" tag in an "a"
         element.  (See [URI] and [HTML]).

      URI-HOST:  The "host" portion of a URI found in the message.  Note
         that this can be a DNS domain name or an IP address, each in
         any of various encodings.  (See [URI] and [HTML]).


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo presents one action for IANA, namely the registraton of the
   reputation application "email-content".

5.1.  Registration of 'email-content' Reputation Application

   This section registers the "email-content" reputation application, as
   defined in [RFCxxxx+1].  The registration parameters are as folows:

   o  Application name: email-content

   o  Short description: Evaluates any of various properties of an email
      message that are not identities

   o  Defining document: [this memo]

   o  Status: current


6.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes security considerations introduced by the media
   type defined here.
