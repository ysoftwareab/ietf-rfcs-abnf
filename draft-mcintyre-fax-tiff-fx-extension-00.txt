Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000



E1.1. Introduction

   This document describes extensions to RFC XXXX [RFCXXXX], TIFF-FX (File
   Format for Internet Fax, or TIFF Fax eXtended), to augment the features
   and capabilities for the data content and structure generated by the
   current suite of ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 facsimile.

   These Recommendations and the TIFF fields described here support the
   following new facsimile profile:

      T: TIFF-FX Extension 4: Black-and-White JBIG2 Extension - a JBIG2
         profile for binary data, built upon extensions used for the JBIG2
         extension to Profile M (TIFF-FX Extension 5), but with limitations
         for binary-only data.

   and create new extensions for the following new features:

      TIFF-FX Extension 1: Resolution and ImageWidth Extensions - extends the
         resolutions and image widths available for all Profiles
      TIFF-FX Extension 2: N-Layer Profile M Extension - extends the 3-layer
         model into N layers
      TIFF-FX Extension 3: Shared Resources Extension to Profile M - enables
         data to be shared among different images and pages; an enabler for
         compression gains by using JBIG2 encoding
      TIFF-FX Extension 5: JBIG2 Extension of Profile M - the binary and color
         extension to Profile M which enables JBIG2 coding using T.88 (JBIG2,
         binary) and T.45 (colour tag extensions to JBIG2)


   This extension specification of TIFF-FX for facsimile is known as TIFF-FX
   Extension 1.


E1.1.1 Scope

   This document defines extensions to RFC XXXX, titled "File Format for
   Internet Fax", known as TIFF-FX. These extensions add new functionality to
   the profiles of TIFF-FX, with the exception of Profile S, which is
   highly constrained. Most of these extensions can be independently used;
   although some extensions may rely on others.

   Unless otherwise noted, the primary reference is RFC XXXX "File Format for
   Internet Fax" (TIFF-FX), which references the following as it's primary
   references: the current TIFF specification [TIFF] and selected TIFF
   Technical Notes [TTN1, TTN2].

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


E1.1.2 Overview of this draft

   This Section gives an overview of TIFF-FX Extensions 1. Section E1.2
   describes the requirements imposed on all TIFF-FX extensions. Sections
   E1.3 through E1.7 describe the five new extensions. One extension is a new
   profile, Profile T, and is located in Section E1.4. This section also
   specifies the ITU-compatible field values (image parameters) for Profile T.

   Throughout this document, Profiles, and section numbers without an "E1"
   prefix, refer to RFC XXXX, the pending Draft Standard for TIFF-FX.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", " NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [REQ].

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


E1.2. TIFF Fields Required and Recommendations for All TIFF-FX Extensions

E1.2.1. Required Fields

E1.2.1.1. GlobalParametersIFD Field

   Status of the GlobalParametersIFD (GPIFD) is being changed from Recommended
   to Required, for all extensions. This change is based on the fact that more
   than one required extensions, such as SharedResources and TIFF-FXExtensions,
   have global file implications (i.e. apply across multiple pages or Primary
   IFDs), warranting their location within the GPIFD. Accommodation of these
   required fields within the GPIFD then requires change in status of the GPIFD
   to Required.

E1.2.1.1.1 Instructions

   Remove the GlobalParametersIFD filed from Section 2.2.4 "New TIFF fields
   recommended for fax profiles" and append the following revised definition to
   Sections 4.2.3, 5.2.3, 6.2.3, 7.2.3 and 8.2.3 "New Fields":

GlobalParametersIFD (400)                                    IFD or LONG
   The GlobalParametersIFD, defined in RFC XXXX Section 2.2.4, is an IFD 
   containing global parameters. It SHALL be present for all TIFF-FX 
   extensions. This reflects a modification to the Section 2.2.4 definition 
   where GlobalParametersIFD is defined as a Recommended field. The RFC XXXX 
   GlobalParametersIFD definition is further modified in that it is permitted 
   to contain fields that are NOT legal in any other IFD. The new
   SharedResources field is one such field that is not permitted in any other 
   IFD, see the Shared Resources Extension to Profile M below.

   It is recommended that a TIFF writer place this field in the first IFD, 
   where a TIFF reader would find it quickly. If a conflict exists between 
   fields in the GlobalParametersIFD and in the image IFDs, then the data in 
   the image IFD shall prevail.

E1.2.1.2. TIFF-FXExtensions Field

   The TIFF-FXExtensions field is introduced to be an identification mechanism
   for all TIFF-FX extensions and SHALL be present when an extension is used.
   The extensions are identified by bit value assignment, accommodating use of
   more than one extensions at the same time. The TIFF-FXExtensions field SHALL
   be placed within the GlobalParametersIFD. 

E1.2.1.2.1 Instructions

   Add the TIFF-FXExtensions filed to Sections 4.2.3, 5.2.3, 6.2.3, 7.2.3 and
   8.2.3 "New Fields", as defined below:

TIFF-FXExtensions (407)                                             LONG
   Count = 1   
         [[Note assignment of the 407 tag value has been 
           requested of Adobe. This value is subject to 
           change until Adobe's confirmation has been received]]

   This field identifies the RFC XXXX extension(s) that apply to this file. The 
   field accommodates the need to continually enhance the functionality of 
   TIFF-FX since it was issued as a Draft Standard. This field SHALL only 
   appear in the GlobalParametersIFD, it is NOT legal in any other IFD. It is 
   required and SHALL be present with use of any TIFF-FX extension.

   A value of 1 in a bit location indicates the corresponding TIFF-FX Extension 
   is used. More than one bit set to 1 means more than one TIFF-FX Extension is 
   used in the file.

Current TIFF-FX Extensions:
  +------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

  |              | If bit 1 is 1, then the provision to use more than three  |
  |              | MRC layers SHALL be available.                            |
  +------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
  |   2  |   3   | Shared Resources Extension to Profile M                   |
  |      |       | If bit 2 is 1, then Profile M and Shared Resources        |
  |      |       | provisions SHALL be available.                            |
  +------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
  |   3  |   4   | Profile T - Black-and-White JBIG2 Extension               |
  |      |       | If bit 3 is 1, then Black-and-White JBIG2 coding SHALL be |
  |      |       | available (i.e. Compression = 12, TIFF-FXExtension bit 2  |
  |      |       | is set and bilevel constrained MRC model is applied).     |
  +------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
  |   4  |   5   | JBIG2 Extension of Profile M                              |
  |      |       | If bit 4 is 1, JBIG2 SHALL be available for Mask layer    |
  |      |       | coding and colour tags for foreground layers (i.e.        |
  |      |       | Compression = 12 and TIFF-FXExtension bit 2 is set).      |

E1.2.2. Recommended Fields

E1.2.2.1. FaxProfile Field

   The FaxProfile field is revised for two reasons: 1) acknowledge the new
   MultiProfiles field, specified below, and make provisions for association
   of the two fields. 2) update the current profiles list to include the new
   Profile T, specified later in this document.

E1.2.2.1.1 Instructions

   Replace the existing FaxProfile filed in Section 2.2.4 "New TIFF fields
   recommended for fax profiles" with the following:


FaxProfile(402) = 0 - 7, 255.                                       BYTE
   The profile that applies to this file; a profile is a subset of the
   full set of permitted fields and field values of TIFF for facsimile.
   This field is used to indicate the profile used within the file when
   only one profile is used. The MultiProfiles field is used when
   more than one profiles are used within the file. A FaxProfile value
   of 255 (X'FF') indicates that the MultiProfiles is used.
    The currently defined FaxProfile values associated with a profile are:
    0: does not conform to a profile defined for TIFF for facsimile
    1: minimal black & white lossless, Profile S
    2: extended black & white lossless, Profile F
    3: lossless JBIG black & white, Profile J
    4: lossy color and grayscale, Profile C
    5: lossless color and grayscale, Profile L
    6: Mixed Raster Content, Profile M
    7: lossy and lossless JBIG2 black & white, Profile T

E1.2.2.2. MultiProfiles Field

   This field makes provision to signal the use of two or more different
   encoding profiles in the processing of a single file. RFC XXXX makes no
   statement with regard to the appropriateness of using encodings of two or
   more different profiles within a file. There is no question as to the value
   of such a provision. This is illustrated by an example where the first ten
   black-and-white text pages of a fifteen page document are processed using
   Profile F MMR (G4) encoding while the last five colour pages are processed
   using Profile C JPEG encoding. The existing FaxProfile field is used within
   the file to signal one encoding profile. In response to requests received
   from implementors, this extension introduces the MultiProfiles field, to be
   used when more than one profile is used within a file.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


   Files containing more that one profile SHOULD contain the MultiProfiles
   field, identifying the profiles present. When present, the MultiProfiles
   field SHALL reside within the GlobalParameterIFD. The number of profiles
   present within a file is ambiguous without the MultiProfiles or FaxProfile
   field. It is highly likely that readers of files without the MultiProfiles
   or FaxProfile will assume that only one profile is present, the profile that
   is consistent with the Compression type and other relevant values that are
   present within the first IFD. Such readers may experience difficulty if
   different Compression types and/or other relevant parameters are encountered
   in subsequent IFDs within the file.

E1.2.2.2.1 Instructions

a) Append the new MultiProfiles field, specified below, to Section 2.2.4 "New TIFF fields recommended for fax profiles" following the ModeNumber field:

MultiProfiles(406)                                              LONG
Count = 1
         [[Note assignment of the 406 tag value has been 
           requested of Adobe. This value is subject to 
           change until Adobe's confirmation has been received]]

    The profiles that apply to this file; a profile is a subset of the
    full set of permitted fields and field values of TIFF for facsimile.
    This field is used when more than one profiles are used within the 
    file. This field SHALL only be present when the FaxProfile field has
    a value of 255 (X'FF').
    A value of 1 in a bit location indicates the corresponding
    profile is used. The currently defined bits are:
    Bit 0: minimal black & white lossless, Profile S
    Bit 1: extended black & white lossless, Profile F
    Bit 2: lossless JBIG black & white, Profile J
    Bit 3: lossy color and grayscale, Profile C
    Bit 4: lossless color and grayscale, Profile L
    Bit 5: Mixed Raster Content, Profile M
    Bit 6: lossy and lossless JBIG2 black & white, Profile T
    Bits 7-31: reserved for future use.

    WARNING: Files containing more that one profiles "SHOULD" contain
    the MultiProfiles field, identifying the profiles present. The
    number of profiles present within a file is ambiguous without the
    MultiProfiles or FaxProfile field. It is highly likely that
    readers of files without the MultiProfiles or FaxProfile will
    assume that only one profile is present, the profile that is
    consistent with the Compression type and other relevant values that
    are present within the first IFD. Such readers may experience
    difficulty if different Compression types and/or other relevant
    parameters are encountered in subsequent IFDs within the file.

b) Append the new 4.5.7 "Multiple Profiles within a file" section, specified below, to Section 4.5 "Implementation Warnings" following Section 4.5.6:

4.5.7 Multiple Profiles within a file
   Files containing more that one profile "SHOULD" contain the
   MultiProfiles field, identifying the profiles present. The number
   of profiles present within a file is ambiguous without the
   MultiProfiles or FaxProfile field. It is highly likely that
   readers of files without the MultiProfiles or FaxProfile will
   assume that only one profile is present, the profile that is
   consistent with the Compression type and other relevant values that
   are present within the first IFD. Such readers may experience
   difficulty if different Compression types and/or other relevant
   parameters are encountered in subsequent IFDs within the file.


E1.3. TIFF-FX Extension 1: Resolution and ImageWidth Extensions

   The ITU-T has approved a new set of X and YResolutions, along with
   corresponding image widths (i.e. page widths). This extension makes
   provisions for using these extended resolutions.

The TIFF-FXExtensions field, below, SHALL be present when this extension
is used.

TIFF-FXExtensions (407) bit 0 is 1                                  LONG
   See Section E1.2.1.2.


E1.3.1 Instructions

a) Replace the 2nd sentence of Section 2.2.2 "Additional TIFF fields
   required for all fax profiles" XResolution field with the following:

    The ITU-T Recommendations for facsimile specify a small number
    of horizontal resolutions: 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 1200 pixels per inch, 
    and 80, 160 pixels per centimeter (or 204, 408 pixels per inch). 

b) Replace the 2nd sentence of Section 2.2.2 "Additional TIFF fields
   required for all fax profiles" YResolution field with the following:

    The ITU-T Recommendations for facsimile specify a small number of
    vertical resolutions: 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1200 pixels per
    inch, and 38.5, 77, 154 pixels per centimeter (or 98, 196, 391 pixels per

d) Replace the ImageWidth field in Section 4.2.1. "Baseline fields" with the following:

ImageWidth(256)                                            SHORT or LONG
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    This profile supports the following fixed page widths: 1728, 2592, 3456, 
    5184, 10368 (corresponding to North American Letter and Legal, ISO A4 paper
    sizes), 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, 12288 (corresponding to ISO B4 paper size), 
    and 2432, 3648, 4864, 7296, 14592 (corresponding to ISO A3 paper size).
    No default; must be specified

   NOTE: Historical TIFF-F did not include support for the following
   widths related to higher resolutions: 2592, 3072, 3648, 3456, 4096, 
   4864, 5184, 6144, 7296, 10368, 12288 and 14592. Historical TIFF-F documents 
   also included the following values related to A5 and A6 widths: 816 and 
   1216. Per the most recent version of [T.4], A5 and A6 documents are no 
   longer supported in Group 3 facsimile, so the related width values are now 
   obsolete. See section 4.5.2 for more information on inch/metric 
   equivalencies and other implementation details.

e) Replace the XResolution field in Section 4.2.1. "Baseline fields" with the following:

XResolution(282) = 200, 204, 300, 400, 408, 600, 1200              RATIONAL
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The horizontal resolution of the image is expressed in pixels per
    resolution unit. In pixels/inch, the allowed values are: 200, 204,
    300, 400, 408, 600 and 1200. See Section 2.2.2 for inch-metric equivalency.
    No default, must be specified

   NOTE: The values of 200 and 408, 600 and 1200 have been added to the
   Historical TIFF-F values, for consistency with [T.30]. Some existing TIFF-F
   implementations may also support values of 80 pixels/cm, which is
   equivalent to 204 pixels per inch. See section 4.5.2 for information
   on implementation details.

f) Replace the YResolution field in Section 4.2.1. "Baseline fields" with the following:

YResolution(283) = 98, 100, 196, 200, 300, 391, 400,           RATIONAL
                   600, 800 and 1200

    The vertical resolution of the image is expressed in pixels per 
    resolution unit. In pixels/inch, the allowed values are: 98, 100,
    196, 200, 300, 391, 400, 600, 800 and 1200 pixels/inch.
    See Section 2.2.2 for inch-metric equivalency.
    No default, must be specified

   NOTE: The values of 100, 200, 391, 600, 800 and 1200 have been added to the
   historical TIFF-F values, for consistency with [T.30].  Some existing
   TIFF-F implementations may also support values of 77 and 38.5 (cm),
   which are equivalent to 196 and 98 pixels per inch respectively. See
   section 4.5.2 for more information on implementation details.

   NOTE: Not all combinations of XResolution, YResolution and ImageWidth
   are legal. The following table gives the legal combinations and
   corresponding paper size [T.30].

g) Replace the Resolution and ImageWidth table that follows YResolution in Section 4.2.1. "Baseline fields" with the following:

    +--------------------------------+---------------------------+
    |   XResolution x YResolution    |         ImageWidth        |

h) Replace the ImageWidth field in Section 6.2.1. "Baseline Fields" with the following:

ImageWidth(256).                                             SHORT or LONG
    This profile supports the following fixed page widths: 864, 1024,

    6144, 7296, 10368, 12288, 14592.

i) Replace the XResolution and YResolution fields in Section 6.2.1. "Baseline Fields" with the following:

XResolution(282) = 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 1200.                 RATIONAL
YResolution(283) = 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 1200.                 RATIONAL
    The resolution of the image is expressed in pixels per resolution
    unit. In pixels per inch, allowed XResolution values are: 100, 200,
    300, 400, 600 and 1200. The base color fax profile requires the pixels
    to be square, hence YResolution must equal XResolution. Base resolution
    is 200 pixels per inch and SHALL be supported by all implementations of
    this profile.

   NOTE: The functional equivalence of inch-based and metric-based resolu-
   tions is maintained, per Annex E.6.5 in [T.4]. See table in Sec. 2.2.2.

   NOTE: Not all combinations of XResolution, YResolution and ImageWidth
   are legal. The following table gives the legal combinations for inch-
   based resolutions and the corresponding paper sizes [T.30].

j) Replace the Resolution and ImageWidth table that follows YResolution in Section 6.2.1. "Baseline fields" with the following:

E1.4. TIFF-FX Extension 2: N-Layer Profile M Extension

E1.4.1 Introduction

   This section defines the N-layer extension to the 3-layer Mixed Raster
   Content profile or Profile M of TIFF for facsimile. By applying the
   appropriate black-and-white, bilevel, constraints from Extension 4
   (Section E1.6), the N-layer model and rules of this extension may also
   be applied to Profile T.

   Often times, the contents of a page can be broken up into more components
   than a 3-layer representation would allow. For instance, a complex magazine
   article may do well to have: 
     - a low resolution background image, for a low variance picture. Let's
       say this is 100 dpi, and is color. 
     - a high resolution mask layer, for the large amount of text and lines.
       Let's say this is 400 dpi (and binary). 
     - a low resolution foreground image, for the text and line color. Let's
       say this is 100 dpi, and is color. 
     - several medium resolution, for the pictures that are scattered
       throughout the page. 
   Let's say they are 200 dpi, and are color. Of these, several may be odd
   shapes (non-rectangular), and would require a separate mask to select their
   regions. 

   It would also help to have page regions broken up into many components or
   objects, which would aid in page editing. The pictures separated from the
   rest of the page could individually be modified, copied, or removed.
 
   Expanding the 3-layer MRC model to N-layers allows for greater complexity
   of a page content, with the same simplicity in the existing model. 

   This N-layer Profile M Extension is specified by defining specific
   modifications to the text of Profile M. As a result of the specification
   method, this extension should be read in conjunction with Profile M.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


E1.4.2. 8.1. Overview

   The objective is to change 3-layer to N-layer references.

   2nd paragraph - replace the 3rd and 4th sentences with the following:

   By itself, MRC does not define any new coding methods or
   resolutions. Instead it defines an N-layer (where N is a positive
   integer) image model for structuring and combining the scanned image
   data. The MRC N-layer model has been applied here using the TIFF format
   to yield a data structure which differs from [T.44] though it applies
   the same coding methods, uses the same compressed image data streams
   and is consistent with the TIFF principle of a single IFD per image.

E1.4.3. 8.1.1. MRC 3-layer model

   The objective is to change 3-layer to N-layer references, specify the
   presence of multiple foreground and mask layers, distinguish role of
   Primary Mask relative to secondary mask layers and their interactions:

a) Title and 1st paragraph - replace the title and paragraph with
   the following:

8.1.1. MRC N-layer model

   The N layers of the MRC model are Background (layer 1), Mask (even numbered
   layers such as 2, 4, 6,..., N-1) and Foreground (odd numbered layers such as
   3, 5, 7,..., N) pairs. The Mask and Foreground layers occur in Mask and
   Foreground pairs (i.e. layers 2 & 3, 4 & 5, 6 & 7, ..., N-1 & N pairs). The
   odd numbered layers (Background and Foreground) are encoded with multi-level
   coders while the even numbered layers (Mask) are encoded with bi-level
   coders. Each layer may appear only once on a page and is coded independently
   of the other layers. The final image is obtained by using the Mask layers to
   determine which of the Foreground layer pixels are rendered over the
   Background layer or composite of layers below the Mask. When the Mask layer
   pixel value is 1, the corresponding pixel from the corresponding Foreground
   layer is selected; when it is 0, the corresponding pixel from the Background
   layer or composite of layers below the Mask is selected.
   Details are given in the Introduction and in Annex A of [T.44].

b) 4th paragraph - replace with the following:

   Not all pages, and not all parts of a page, require 3 or more layers.
   If a page consists of only one layer, then that layer is the primary
   image whether it is a Background, Mask, or Foreground layer. If
   there is more than one layer, then the Primary Mask (layer 2) must be
   one of the layers, in which case it is the primary image. In all cases,
   the primary image must be page size.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


c) 5th paragraph, 1st sentence - replace with the following:

   MRC [T.44] allows a page to be transmitted as a series of stripes
   with each stripe consisting of 1, 2, 3 or N layers. 

d) 6th paragraph - replace with the following:

   Furthermore, color fax also requires the spatial resolutions of
   Background and Foreground images to be legal fax values that are
   also integer factors of the Primary Mask image resolution. For example, if
   the Primary Mask Layer resolution is 400 pixels per inch, then allowed
   resolutions for the Foreground, Background and secondary Mask (layers 2, 4,
   6, ..., N-1) layers are 100, 200 or 400 pixels per inch; if the Primary Mask
   is at 300 pixels per inch, then allowed values are 100 and 300. The
   Foreground, Background and secondary Mask layer resolutions can be
   independently set of each other.

E1.4.4. 8.1.2. A TIFF Representation for the MRC 3-layer model

   The objective is to change 3-layer to N-layer references, specify multiple
   foreground and mask layers, define their IFD and SubIFD relationships and
   structural layout:

a) Title and 1st paragraph - replace the title and paragraph with
   the following:

8.1.2. A TIFF Representation for the MRC N-layer model

   In the TIFF representation of the N-layer MRC model, each page is
   represented by a single IFD, called the Primary IFD. The nextIFD 
   offset associated with a Primary IFD will point to the Primary IFD 
   of the next page.  If the page consists of a single layer, then the 
   Primary IFD represents that layer. If more than one layer is present,
   the Primary IFD represents the Primary Mask layer and the other layers are 
   represented by a set of child IFDs that are referenced through the 
   SubIFD extension field [TTN1] of the Primary IFD. To distinguish MRC-
   specific SubIFDs from other SubIFDs, the NewSubFileType field MUST 
   have Bit 4 ON, indicating an MRC-related IFD. A new ImageLayer field
   is also introduced that consists of two values that identify the 
   layer (Background [layer 1], Mask [layer 2, 4, 6, ..., N-1], or Foreground
   [layer 3, 5, 7, ..., N]) and the order within the layer (first, second, ...
   image of the layer); see Section 8.2.3.

b) 5th paragraph, last sentence - replace the sentence with the following:

   In all cases, if the Primary Mask layer exists, it shall be represented by
   a single IFD and a single set of coding parameters.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


c) 6th paragraph, first 3 sentences - replace the sentences with the
   following:

   The use of SubIFDs to store child IFDs is described in [TTN1]. When
   a Mask is the primary image, the Background and Foreground layer
   images are represented with child IFDs that are referenced by the
   SubIFDs field in the Primary IFD.  There are many possible ways to
   represent the Background and Foreground layer images: (1) the
   SubIFD field of the Primary IFD is an array of pointers to all
   child image IFDs, one entry per child image; (2) the SubIFD field is
   a single pointer to a linked list of all child image IFDs; (3) the
   SubIFD field is an array of N-1 pointers, where the first pointer is
   to a linked list of all Background layer (layer 1) image IFDs, the second
   pointer is to a linked list of all the first Foreground layer (layer 3)
   image IFDs, the third pointer is to a linked list of all the second Mask
   layer (layer 4) IFDs, the N-1 pointer is to a linked list of all the Nth
   layer IFDs. 

d) IFD - SubIFD tree diagram that follows the 6th paragraph - replace the
   tree diagram with the following:


                                (nextIFD)

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


e) Last paragraph, last sentence - replace the sentence with the following:

   If the image data is not ITU L*a*b*, the ImageBaseColor is interpreted as
   8-bit ITU L*a*b*; see Section 8.2.3.

E1.4.5. 8.2.1. Baseline Fields

   The objective is to reflect presence of the multiple foreground and
   mask layers and the distinct Primary Mask layer in some tags and specify
   the impact of have no image data in the multiple mask and foreground layer
   pairs.

a) ImageWidth - replace with the following:

ImageWidth(256).                                           SHORT or LONG
   Same page widths as Profile C, the base color profile; see Section
   6.2.1.  In Profile M, the width of an image (i.e. Foreground, Background,
   or Mask layer) in the coded data stream may be less than the page width,
   unless the Background, Foreground or Mask is the primary image (i.e. the
   Primary IFD), in which case the width of the coded data stream is the page
   width. The ImageWidth field will always store the actual width of the coded
   data.

b) Compression - replace the first sentence with the following:

   For Mask layers, see Sections 4.2.1 and 5.2.1

c) PhotometricInterpretation - replace with the following:

PhotometricInterpretation(262) = 0, 2, 5, 10.                   SHORT
   For Mask layers, 0.  For Foreground and Background layers, see
   Sections 6.2.1 and 7.2.1.

d) StripByteCounts - replace the tag with the following:

StripByteCounts(279)                                    SHORT or LONG
   In Profile M, it is permissible for the StripByteCounts value for a
   given strip, other than one corresponding to a Primary Mask, to have a zero
   entry. This means there is no encoded image data corresponding to that
   strip. Instead, for the Foreground or Background layers the current default
   image color should be used for the strip. The standard default image colors
   are black for the Foreground layer and White for the Background layer. The
   ImageBaseColor field can be used to specify other default colors, see 8.2.3.
   Since the absence of a mask layer, other than a Primary Mask, defaults to
   selecting the corresponding foreground layer, a zero-byte mask strip equates
   to a missing portion of the mask layer. In which case, the foreground is
   selected for that region.e) YResolution - replace the last sentence with the
   following:

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


   The resolution of Mask, Background and Foreground layers must each be an
   integer factor of the Primary image, which is the Primary Mask layer,
   when it is present; see Section 8.4.

E1.4.6. 8.2.2. Extension Fields

   The objective is to reflect presence of the multiple mask layers.

a) T6Options - replace the tag with the following:

T6Options(293) = 0.                                                SHORT
   For Mask layers, see Section 4.2.2.

E1.4.7. 8.2.3. New Fields

   The objective is to reflect presence of the multiple mask and foreground
   Layers, their impact on the ImageLayer tag and resulting extension
   of the ImageLayer[0] field values. The newly required TIFF-FXExtension
   tag and minimal bit setting is specified.

a) T82Options - replace the tag with the following:

T82Options(435)                                                     LONG
   For Mask layers, see Section 5.2.3.

b) ImageLayer - replace the tag, descriptive paragraph and ImageLayer[0]
   field with the following:

ImageLayer (34732).                                                 LONG
   Count = 2
   Image layers are defined such that layer 1 is the Background layer. Layers
   above layer 1 are arranged in mask (i.e. even numbered layers) and
   foreground (i.e. odd numbered layers) pairs. The mask selects pixels from
   the associated foreground that will be rendered on top of the Background or
   composite of layers below the mask. For example, layer 2 (i.e. the Primary
   Mask or first mask layer) selects pixels from layer 3 (i.e. the first
   foreground layer) that will be rendered on top of the Background. Layer 4
   (i.e. the second mask layer) selects pixels from layer 5 (i.e. the second
   foreground layer) that will be rendered on top of the composite of layers 1
   through 3 below. The ImageLayer tag contains two values, describing the
   layer to which the image belongs and the order in which it is imaged.

   ImageLayer[0] = 1, 2, 3, ..., N.
     1: Image is a Background image, i.e., the image that will appear
        whenever the Primary Mask contains a value of 0. Background images 
        typically contain low-resolution, continuous-tone imagery.
     2: Image is the Primary Mask layer. In MRC, if more than one layer is
        present then the Primary Mask layer (layer 2) is present, it
        must be the Primary IFD and be full page in extent.
     3: Image is the first Foreground image, i.e., the image that will appear
        whenever the Primary Mask contains a value of 1. The Foreground image
        generally defines the color of text or lines, but may also contain
        high-resolution imagery.
     4: Image is the second Mask layer (layer 4). 
     5: Image is the second Foreground image (layer 5), i.e., the image that
        will be rendered on top of the composite of layers 1 through 3 below
        whenever the second Mask contains a value of 1. 
   N-1: Image is the (N-1)/2 Mask layer. 
     N: Image is the (N-1)/2 Foreground image, i.e., the image that will be
        rendered on top of the composite of layers N-2 below whenever the
        (N-1)/2 Mask contains a value of 1. 

TIFF-FXExtensions (407) bit 1 is 1                                  LONG
   See Section E1.2.1.2.

E1.4.8. 8.4. Rules and Requirements for Images

   The objective is to reflect presence and impact of the multiple mask and
   Foreground layers and the Primary IFD role in rules 1, 4, 8 and 9.

a) Replace the introductory sentence, along with rules 1, 4, 8 and 9 with the following:

   Profile M defines a fundamental set of rules for images in the N-layer
   representation. The rules, with the appropriate black-and-white (bilevel)
   constraints, also apply to Profile T.

   1. If more than one layer exists, then the a binary Mask layer SHALL
      be present and the first mask layer SHALL be the primary image. Mask
      layers SHALL support the binary data representations defined in Section
      3 and MAY support the binary data representations defined in Sections 4,
      5 and E1.6, with the exception that PhotometricInterpretation SHALL be 0. 
      If only one layer exists, then the image corresponding to that 
      layer is the primary image.

   4. Images other than the Primary Image (i.e. Primary IFD) MAY optionally 
      cover only a portion of the strip or page.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


   8. In MRC Internet Fax, each layer is transmitted as a sequence of strips. 
      If the page consists of a single layer, then all strips shall be 
      stored in the single Primary IFD. In this case, coding parameters cannot
      change between strips. If the page consists of more than one layer,
      then all strips of the Primary Mask layer shall be stored in the single
      Primary IFD. All strips of the Foreground/Background layers SHALL be
      stored in separate IFDs, referenced by the Primary IFD's SubIFD field,
      containing an ImageLayer field with ImageLayer[0] identifying Background
      (layer 1), Foreground layers (layer 3, 5, 7, ..., N) or mask layers (layer
      2, 4, 6, ..., N-1), and Imagelayer[1] identifying order in which images
      within a single layer are to be imaged. The TIFF XPosition and Yposition
      fields are used to indicate the placement of these images with respect
      to the primary image.

   9. When the Primary Mask image is present, the resolution of Background, 
      Foreground and secondary mask images must each be an integer factor of
      the Primary Mask image. For example, if the Primary Mask image is 400
      pixels/inch, then the Background, Foreground or secondary mask images
      may be at 400 pixels/inch (400/1), 200 pixels/inch (400/2) or 100
      pixels/inch (400/4).

E1.4.9. 8.5. Profile M - MRC Fax Profile Summary

   The objective is to identify the secondary mask layers as being among the
   data blocks pointed to by the SubIFD offsets, reflect the required status
   of the GlobalParametersIFD, append the required TIFF-FXExtensions tag to the
   table and callout the need to activate the N-Layer Profile M Extension bit.

a) Replace the introductory sentence, along with rules 1, 4, 8 and 9 with the following:


Revise the following Section 8.5 table entries to read as shown:

E1.5. TIFF-FX Extension 3: Shared Resources Extension to Profile M

   This section defines the Shared Resources extension to Profile M. Shared 
   Resources accommodates a single representation of redundant resources, such
   as image data or encoding tables that appear multiple times within a 
   document. Most importantly, it provides a mechanism for access to the 
   redundant resources by multiple components (i.e. sharing) within the 
   encoding process. The sharing of resources is a new encoding provision 
   defined in ITU-T Rec. T.44 Annex B [T.44Amd1]. The T.44 MRC standard 
   references this provision as Shared Data. Shared Resources is the 
   terminology used in this document. As in T.44, use of Shared Resources is 
   restricted to the MRC structure defined in Profile M and its N-layer 
   Extension, defined in this document. 

E1.5.1. Overview

   Many pages and/or documents have repeating components such as shapes or 
   symbols, words, images and meta-data (e.g. JPEG Huffman Tables). This is 
   especially true for images of text, where the repeating shapes are the 
   characters themselves. The SharedResources field, which references Shared 
   Resource Tables that contain Shared Resource Entries, are defined below to 
   leverage the redundancy of these repeating components by storing each 
   component once, and then referring to each stored component as many times as 
   possible.

E1.5.2. Required TIFF Fields

   This section describes the TIFF fields required, in addition to
   those in Section 8.2, to represent Shared Resources. 

E1.5.2.1. Baseline Fields
   See Section 8.2.1.

E1.5.2.2. Extension Fields
   See Section 8.2.2.

E1.5.2.3. New Fields
   Append the following to the fields of 8.2.3:

GlobalParametersIFD (400)                                    IFD or LONG
   See Section E0.2.


TIFF-FXExtensions (407) bit 2 SHALL be 1                            LONG
  See Section E0.2.

SharedResources (437)                                               LONG
         [[Note assignment of the 437 tag value has been 
           requested of Adobe. This value is subject to 
           change until Adobe's confirmation has been received]]
  See Section E1.5.4.

E1.5.3. Recommended TIFF Fields

   See Sections 8.3, with exception of GlobalParametersIFD.

E1.5.4 Shared Resources

   The following new field is defined:

SharedResources (437)                                               LONG
   Count = 1
         [[Note assignment of the 437 tag value has been 
           requested of Adobe. This value is subject to 
           change until Adobe's confirmation has been received]]

   The SharedResources field contains the file location (E) of the first Shared 
   Resource Table. Each Shared Resource Table contains a count of the number of 
   Shared Resource Entries that physically exist in the table (whether filled 
   with a shared resource or not) , the Shared Resource Entries themselves, and 
   the file location of the next Shared Resource Table (if any). 

   There can be as many Shared Resources Tables as necessary to describe the 
   number of shared resource items, but there SHALL be only one SharedResources 
   field in a file, and it SHALL be attached to the GlobalParametersIFD 
   (recommended to be attached to the first IFD in the file). The 
   SharedResources field is required when sharing resources and SHALL be 
   present. 

   Each Shared Resources Table consists of a 2-byte count of the number of 
   physical entries, a sequence of 16-byte shared resource entries, and a 4-
   byte offset to the next Shared Resources Table. The last shared resources 
   table has a "next table file offset" of 0.

   The reference to a shared resource entry SHALL be by a unique ID, which 
   SHALL be the offset of the entry in the list described by the Shared 
   Resources Tables; the first shared resource entry SHALL have ID 0. Note that
   the "list" of shared resource entries is what the series of Shared Resources 
   Tables will contain, when collected together. The order of the shared 
   resource tables SHALL determine the order of the resource IDs. For example, 
   if the first three tables (A, B and C) have 3, 1 and 2 resources 
   respectively; then table A will contain resources with IDs 0, 1, and 2; 
   table B will contain the resource with ID 3; and table C will contain 
   resources with IDs 4 and 5. Note that if copying resources from one file to 
   another, the resource ID will likely need revision to be brought in 
   alignment with the destination table; additionally, any copied data that 
   refers to the copied resource will require a change in the reference to the 
   new ID.

E1.5.4.1 Resource Lists

   To reference entire resources, their IDs may be enumerated in a Resource 
   List that will appear in data that directly requires inclusion of the 
   resource to be complete.  For instance, an image strip that requires a 
   resource in order to be a complete compressed data stream, will include a 
   ResourceList. It is up to the interpretation of the reference data type 
   (i.e. Compression type) as to how the resource will be used.

   A ResourceList list will contain a 2-byte count of the number of IDs (i) in
   the list, followed by i 4-byte IDs.

E1.6. TIFF-FX Extension 4: Profile T - Lossy and Lossless JBIG2 Black-and-White
      Fax profile

   This section defines the lossy and lossless JBIG2 black-and-white profile or
   Profile T of TIFF for facsimile. JBIG2, ITU-T Rec. T.88 / ISO-IEC 14492 
   [T.88], is frequently referenced as symbol or token-based compression 
   because it makes use of repeating shapes. The Profile T designation is 
   representative of token-based compression. All profile T readers and writers 
   SHALL also be able to read and write Profile S, since Profile S is the 
   minimal binary TIFF-FX profile. 

E1.6.1. Overview

   This section describes a black-and-white profile that uses JBIG2
   compression. The ITU-T has approved the lossy and lossless modes of JBIG2 
   for Group 3 facsimile. JBIG2 compression is typically used in accordance 
   with the application rules given in ITU-T Rec. T.89 [T.89].

   This profile is essentially a black-and-white constrained profile of 
   Profile M plus the Profile M Shared Resources extension. The MRC 3-layer
   model and TIFF representation, defined in Section 8.1 and constrained to a
   single image layer (i.e. only one layer with image data), SHALL be used.





McIntyre et al.            Expires January 2001                  [Page 28]


Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


   The behavior and structure of this profile is effectively that of a plain
   single-layer image, similar to that of Profiles S, F and C, with some added
   structure to accommodate JBIG2's meta-data. Within this context, bit 4 of
   the NewSubFileType field SHALL be set, indicating the MRC imaging model,
   also only even numbered values of the ImageLayer[0] field SHALL have non-
   zero values of StripByteCounts, indicating mask layer. Additionally the
   SharedResources field SHALL be used to store JBIG2 Resources, such as symbol
   dictionaries, and the Compression type SHALL be set to 12 (JBIG2
   Compression). These requirements are consistent with ITU-T's definitions in
   Rec. T.4 Annex H [T.4Amd1] and Rec. T.44 Annex B.

   JBIG2 compression utilizes the fact that many images have repeating shapes
   or symbols. This is especially true for images of text, where the repeating 
   shapes are the characters themselves. Symbol or token-based compression 
   makes use of these repeating shapes, by storing a set of images for the 
   symbols once, and then referring to the symbol image as many times as 
   possible.

   In a multi-page document, the same shape can occur on multiple pages. In 
   fact, this is quite common: any shape occurring on the first page is likely 
   to show up on all the other pages in the document. JBIG2 compresses even 
   better by collecting all the repeating shapes from multiple pages, and 
   allowing this collection to be referred to by more than one page. This 
   collection of symbol images is referred to as a symbol dictionary. A 
   document can contain more than one symbol dictionary. For example, one 
   symbol dictionary might contain all the symbols that occurred on more than 
   one page; each page then might have its own symbol dictionary, containing 
   all the symbols that occurred only on that page.

   There are two typical ways of compressing symbols on a page using (or 
   generating) a symbol dictionary. One is by finding an exact match 
   (lossless), and the other is by allowing a small amount of discrepancy 
   between the symbol candidate, and the matching symbol in the symbol 
   dictionary (lossy). The mode used can be distinguished by the value of the 
   "Lossless" bit in the T88Options[0] field, which is defined below.
 
   The representation of a symbol-compressed image consists of a resource list,
   which identifies which "JBIG2 Resources" are used, and a "JBIG2-coded 
   position block". A JBIG2 Resource is used to represent a variety of JBIG2 
   shared entities (i.e. JBIG2 resources) such as symbol dictionaries, pattern 
   dictionaries, which are used in halftone coding, and Huffman tables. The 
   symbol dictionaries are typically contained within one or more JBIG2 
   Resources, represented within the SharedResoures provisions of the Shared 
   Resources Extension of Profile M. The JBIG2-coded position block contains of 
   a series of symbol X and Y-Position coordinates, plus the IDs of the symbols
   located by the coordinates. The symbol bitmaps are stored in the referenced
   symbol dictionaries.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


   Each TIFF strip in an IFD whose Compression is equal to 12 (the TIFF
   Compression value defined for JBIG2 below) SHALL be formatted as described
   in Section E1.6.5 (The JBIG2 Image Strip).

E1.6.1.1 Why Use JBIG2

   The symbol-based compression model is incorporated in the JBIG2 standard; 
   this standard boosts compression of text-like documents by retaining similar 
   shapes across multiple images. In the case of text, the shapes are the 
   character symbols, and for multi-page documents, the set of unique character 
   symbols may be fairly small, especially when the same font is used on each 
   page.

   A typical image of binary text, at 300 dpi might take about 80 kilobytes to 
   store using T.6 compression; a similar JBIG2 file might only require around 
   20 kilobytes to store. The compression gain can be up to a factor of two 
   larger for multi-page documents. Sharing dictionaries between multiple pages 
   makes this high compression possible, but requires some way to refer to the 
   dictionaries used by more than one page; this is the reason for using 
   Profile M and its Shared Resources provisions.

E1.6.2. Required TIFF Fields

   This section describes the TIFF fields required, in addition to those in
   Sections 8.2 and E1.5.2, for Profile T. Additionally it describes those not
   required in Section 8.2 and constrained differently from those in Section
   8.2.

   Note that these fields are defined under the premise that all odd-numbered
   layers are omitted, in conformance to the Profile T black-and-white
   constraint.  However, there are application conditions that would benefit
   from inclusion of these odd-numbered layers and setting the associated
   StripByteCounts to 0. Under these conditions the list of required fields
   and/or values will be modified.  Reference the StripByteCounts field below
   for appropriate modifications.

E1.6.2.1. Baseline Fields

ImageWidth(256).                                           SHORT or LONG
   Same page widths as Profile F, the extended black-and-white profile, and the
   ImageWidth extensions available to Profile F; see Section 4.2.1 and E1.3.
   The change in ImageWidth reference, to those of Profile F rather than
   Profile C, is consistent with the black-and-white constraint of this
   profile.
   Note that for layers other than layer 2, the ImageWidth could be a fragment
   of the page width, as when the XPosition is greater than 0.

BitsPerSample(258) = 1.                                            SHORT
   Constraint is consistent with the black-and-white constraint.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


SamplesPerPixel(277) = 1.                                          SHORT
   Constraint is consistent with the black-and-white constraint.

Compression(259) = 12.                                             SHORT
         [[Note that assignment of value 12 to JBIG2 has been 
           requested of Adobe. This value is subject to 
           change until Adobe's confirmation has been received]]

   12 = JBIG2 coding, ITU-T Rec. T.88 / ISO-IEC 14492 (Lossy/Lossless coding of 
   Bilevel Images, frequently referenced as symbol-based compression), 
   T88Options field may be present when using JBIG2.
   The format of the data pointed to by the StripByteOffsets when 
   Compresstion=12 is described later.

FillOrder(266) = 1, 2.                                             SHORT
   See Section 8.2.1

PhotometricInterpretation(262) = 0.                                SHORT
   Constraint is consistent with the black-and-white constraint and MRC mask 
   layer requirements.

ResolutionUnit(296) = 2.                                           SHORT
   See Section 8.2.1.

StripByteCounts(279)                                       SHORT or LONG
   SHALL be fixed to zero "0" for all odd numbered values of the ImageLayer[0]
   field. In Profile M, it is permissible for the StripByteCounts value for a
   given strip to have a zero entry. This means there is no encoded image data
   corresponding to that strip. Instead, the current default image color should
   be used for the strip. The standard default image colours are white for the
   Background layer and black for the Foreground layer.

   It would be efficient to omit all odd numbered layers for Profile T.
   However, it may be useful to identify portions of a background and/or
   foreground image where the default color should be reversed; namely where a
   background image portion is all black, or where reverse video appears.

   To define a child IFD specifying an odd numbered layer (i.e. foreground or 
   background) but containing no encoded image data, create an IFD with the 
   following settings:
      ImageLayer[0]:             specified odd numbered layer
      ImageLayer[1]:             specified order
      RowsPerStrip:              strip height
      ImageLength:               strip height
      ImageWidth:                specified value, often the Primary IFD width
      BitsPerSample:             8
      PhotometricInterpretation: 10
      SamplesPerPixel:           3

   Same XResolution as Profile F, the extended black-and-white profile, and the 
   XResolution extensions available to Profile F; see Section 4.2.1 and E1.3. 
   The change in XResolution reference, to those of Profile F rather than 
   Profile M, is consistent with the black-and-white constraint of this

   The change in YResolution reference, to those of Profile F rather than
   Profile M, is consistent with the black-and-white constraint of this

E1.6.4.1 The JBIG2 Resource

   The JBIG2 Resource stored in a TIFF file contains three pieces:
     1. A JBIG2 Resource version
     2. A JBIG2-coded resource block
     3. Extensions to the JBIG2 Resource (these extensions contain data that 
        are outside the scope of T.88-JBIG2)

   The JBIG2-coded resource block can have a series of JBIG2 segments. The  
   following segment types may occur:
     - Symbol dictionary segment
     - Pattern dictionary segment
     - Extension segment (future extensions to be defined within the T.88 JBIG2 
       standard)
     - Supported profiles segment
     - Table segment 
   Each segment in a JBIG2-coded resource block SHALL be associated with no 
   page (i.e., SHALL have a page association field value of 0, as described in 
   T.88 - JBIG2 Section 7.2.6).

E1.6.4.2 Decoder Memory

For JBIG2 dictionary Resources, if decoder memory is specified (non-zero value), then it follows the formula described in ITU-T Rec. T.89 (Application Profiles for Recommendation T.88). Namely, the decoder memory is a measure of how much memory is required to hold a decoded  dictionary, according to:
     decoder memory = SUM (32 + (round32(Wi) ( Hi) / 8) over i,   i= 1 to N

   where:
       i = ith symbol in the dictionary
       N = the number of symbols in the dictionary
      32 = a fixed per-symbol overhead required to represent:
             - width of symbol
             - height of symbol
             - symbol ID Huffman code
             - length of symbol ID Huffman code
             - pointer to memory where symbol bitmap resides
     round32 = is a rounding up to the next multiple of 32 bits (e.g., 33 
     rounds to 64, 128 rounds to 128)
      Wi = width of the ith symbol
      Hi = height of the ith symbol

     This means that for each symbol there are 32 bytes overhead, plus Hi rows 
     of bitmap data, each of which is round32(Wi)/8 bytes.

   Note: pattern dictionaries are similar to symbol dictionaries but contain
   halftone patterns; thus references to symbol above should be taken to
   include patterns stored in pattern dictionaries.


E1.6.5 The JBIG2 Image Strip

   The JBIG2 image stored in a TIFF file will have components that require a
   TIFF reader to parse through its content.  This is due to the fact that
   JBIG2 is represented by two types of data:
      1. shared components: namely the symbol or pattern bitmaps that are
         associated with multiple images, which are compressed into
         dictionaries and stored in one or more JBIG2 Resources.
      2. image specific components: data that is specific to one image only,
         that with the aid of the shared components, will allow the image to be
         decoded.

   To couple these two component sets together, each JBIG2 Image Strip within
   an IFD has a corresponding list of resource IDs in the ResourceList section
   of each image strip. The concatenization of the resources and the JBIG2
   position block will comprise a decodable JBIG2 stream for the image
   described by the IFD for that strip.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


   A position block is the base JBIG2 encoding of the binary image. Included in
   the position block are the positions and IDs of the symbol dictionaries,
   which may lie within the position block, and/or outside of it (as JBIG2
   resources). Within the position block, the following segment types may
   occur:
     1. Page information segment
        - Exactly one page information segment SHALL be present, and it SHALL 
          be the first segment in the JBIG2-coded position block
     2. End of page segment
        - Exactly one end of page segment SHALL be present, and it SHALL be the 
          last segment in the JBIG2-coded position block
     3. End of stripe segment
     4. Symbol dictionary segment
     5. Pattern dictionary segment
     6. Generic region segment
     7. Text region segment
     8. Supported profiles segment
     9. Table segment.

   Extension segments are future extensions, to be defined within the T.88
   JBIG2 standard.  Extension segments may be included in an image strip, but
   outside of the position block.

   Each segment in a JBIG2-coded position block SHALL be associated with the 
   page defined by the page information segment.
 
   The image strip consists of four pieces:
     1. A JBIG2 Image Strip version
     2. A ResourceList: list of JBIG2 Resource IDs
     3. The JBIG2-coded position block
     4. Extensions to the image strip (these extensions contain data that are 
        outside the scope of JBIG2, such as colour tags, which are defined 
        within the JBIG2 Extension of Profile M. Colour tags are not permitted 
        within this profile, Profile T).

   If the JBIG2 Image Strip contains extensions, each extension is preceded by
   a two-byte type giving its extension type, and a 4-byte count of its length
   in bytes. Other data that could be stored in an extension includes ASCII
   text, hyperlinks, and so on. If a TIFF reader is not able to interpret an
   extension (if it does not recognize the extension type), then it SHOULD
   ignore that extension, but may skip over it to find further extensions that
   it can interpret.
             
To decode a JBIG2-coded image strip, follow these steps:
       1. Retrieve the list of shared resource IDs from the ResourceList.
       2. Search the collection of JBIG2 Resources for all the JBIG2 Resource,
          such as dictionaries, whose IDs are given in the ResourceList.
          From each one, extract its JBIG2-coded resource block.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


       3. Concatenate those JBIG2-coded resource blocks, in the order in which
          their IDs are given, followed by the JBIG2-coded position block.
       4. Decode the resulting data as a JBIG2 data stream. This SHALL be a
          valid JBIG2 data stream containing a single page: no segment numbers
          may be duplicated, and so on.
   In practice, you won't actually concatenate and decode the JBIG2-coded
   resource block(s) for every position block that uses them, as that's quite
   inefficient. Instead, the JBIG2-coded resource block(s) can be decoded and
   kept in an intermediate format, designed so that the effect of logical
   concatenation can be simulated.

   Note, the description of JBIG2 embedding in TIFF strips does not exclude the
   use of tiles instead of strips.  However, the smaller the image fragments
   are, the greater the possibility that symbols will be sliced up; which may
   cause strange effects when using lossy JBIG2 symbol matching.

E1.6.7 Rules and Requirements for Images

   Profile T defines a fundamental set of rules for images in the 3-layer
   representation.

   1. Only ONE layer with image data SHALL exists and it SHALL be the binary
      Mask layer, which SHALL be represented Primary IFD. Compression 12 SHALL
      Be used in this layer and the PhotometricInterpretation SHALL be 0. 

   2. A Foreground and/or Background layer without image data (i.e. IFD with
      StripByteCounts = 0) MAY be presented. If present, then black Foreground
      and white Background default ImageBaseColor SHALL be used, unless
      specified otherwise as white and black respectively. 

   3. The Primary IFD defines and extends to the entire page boundary; 
      all attached model images cannot extend beyond the Primary image. 
      Resolution differences may cause some pixels to "hang over" the 
      page boundary, but no new pixels should exist completely beyond 
      the page extent.

   4. Images other than the Primary Image (i.e. Primary IFD) MAY optionally 
      cover only a portion of the strip or page.

   5. Each Primary IFD and each MRC-specific SubIFD must have an 
      ImageLayer field to specify which layer the IFD belongs to, and 
      the imaging order of that IFD within the layer.

   6. Each Primary IFD must have a NewSubFileType field value set to 
      18, indicating a single page of a multi-page document (bit 1) and 
      MRC (bit 4).

   7. Each MRC-specific child IFD must have a NewSubFileType field 
      value set to 16, indicating MRC (bit 4).

   8. In MRC Internet Fax, each layer is transmitted as a sequence of strips.
      If the page consists of a single layer, then all strips shall be 
      stored in the single Primary IFD.  In this case, coding 
      parameters cannot change between strips. If the page consists of 
      more than one layer, then all strips of the Primary Mask layer shall be 
      stored in the single Primary IFD. All strips of the Foreground/
      Background layers MAY be stored in one or more IFDs, referenced by 
      the Primary IFD's SubIFD field, containing an ImageLayer field 
      with ImageLayer[0] identifying Background (layer 1) or 
      Foreground layer (layer 3), and Imagelayer[1] identifying order in 
      which images within a single layer are to be imaged. The TIFF 
      XPosition and YPosition fields are used to indicate the placement 
      of these images with respect to the primary image.

   9. When the Primary Mask image is present, The resolution of Background and 
      Foreground images must each be an integer factor of the Primary Mask 
      image. For example, if the Primary Mask image is 400 pixels/inch, then
      the Background or Foreground images may be at 400 pixels/inch (400/1),
      200 pixels/inch (400/2) or 100 pixels/inch (400/4).

E1.6.8. Profile T - Lossy and Lossless JBIG2 Black-and-White Fax profile Summary

   Recommended fields are shown with an asterisk *

   Required fields or values are shown with a double asterisk **. If the
   double asterisk is on the field name, then all the listed values are
   required of implementations; if the double asterisks are in the
   Values column, then only the values suffixed with a double asterisk
   are required of implementations.

E1.7. TIFF-FX Extension 5: JBIG2 Extension of Profile M 

   This section defines extensions to Profile M that augment the pool of coders 
   and encoding mechanisms available for use in the mask and foreground layers 
   when encoding documents with colour. The JBIG2, ITU-T Rec. T.88 / ISO-IEC 
   14492, bilevel coder is made available for use in both mask and foreground 
   layer(s). It must be noted that simple JBIG2 symbol-based compression is 
   limited to matching symbols in a binary image, but ITU-T Rec. T.44 Annex B
   [T.44Amd1] expands this to include single-colour images, such as coloured
   text. The T.44 defined mechanism, referenced as color tag encoding, is only
   available for use in foreground layers that are associated with JBIG2 coded
   mask layers. The more conventional multi-level colour coders, such JPEG, are
   also available for use in the encoding of foreground layer colours when
   JBIG2 is used in the mask layer(s).

E1.7.1. Overview

   Use of JBIG2 in Profile M effectively amounts to application of Profile T 
   (i.e. Section E.2) to the mask layer(s), without imposition of the 
   Profile T black-and-white constraints that prohibit the presence of 
   background and/or foreground image data. This translates to augmenting the 
   MRC 3-layer model and TIFF representation, defined in Profile M, with the
   Shared Resources extension E1, and using JBIG2 coding (i.e. Compression =
   12) in the mask layer. The N-layer model and TIFF representation, defined
   in Extension 2 (Section E1.4) MAY also be used if the corresponding TIFF-
   FXExtension bit is set.

Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


   Use of JBIG2 and colour tagging to encode the colours of the foreground
   layer(s) translates to attaching discrete colour values to the JBIG2 coded
   symbols (shapes) that are represented in the associated mask layer.

E1.7.2. Required TIFF Fields

   This section describes the TIFF fields required, in addition to those in 
   Sections 8.2, E1.4 and E1.5.2.3.

E1.7.2.1. Baseline Fields
   Augment the Section 8.2.1 compression field with JBIG2 (i.e. value = 
   12) as below: 

Compression(259) = 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12.                          SHORT
   For Mask layer, see Sections 4.2.1, 5.2.1 and E1.6.2.1.
   For Foreground and Background layers, see Sections 6.2.1, 7.2.1 and
   E1.6.2.1. Compression=1 is not used by previous profiles. An IFD used only
   to specify the default image colour for a layer and strip will not have
   any encoded image data associated with it, i.e., the StripByteCounts
   field will contain a 0. Since no image data exists in the IFD, the
   Compression field shall be set to 1 indicating no compression. A
   Compression field value of 1 is not allowed for any other IFDs.

E1.7.2.2. Extension Fields
   See Section 8.2.2.

E1.7.2.3. New Fields
   Augment Section 8.2.3 with the fields from E1.5.2.3.

   Bits 2 and 4 of the TIFF-FXExtensions field SHALL be set to 1.

E1.7.3. Recommended TIFF Fields

   See Section E1.6.3.

   The note that appears at the end of the T88Options[0] table, prohibiting 
   activation of bits 5 or 6 (i.e. ColourTagsFollow or ColourTagsPresent 
   respectively) SHALL be disregarded.

   If the IFD's T88Options[0] field has the ColourTagsFollow or 
   ColourTagsPresent bits set, then the following segment types SHALL NOT occur 
   in the JBIG2-coded position block:
     - Pattern dictionary
     - Halftone region
     - Generic region

E1.7.4 JBIG2 Resources 
     See Section E1.6.4.

E1.7.7 Colour Tag (Colour Symbol) Compression

E1.7.7.1 Why Use Colour Tag Compression

   Another opportunity that is afforded by JBIG2 is improved compression of the 
   foreground layer for documents containing coloured text. In most cases, if a 
   document contains text, each individual text character is a single, flat, 
   colour (e.g., black or red), and the number of such colours is limited. The 
   foreground layer in this case looks like a number of coloured blobs, one for 
   each character, each one having the shape of the corresponding character.
   This foreground layer can be compressed using a new method that takes 
   advantage of the JBIG2 structure. If the mask layer is compressed using 
   JBIG2 symbols, then decoding it essentially yields a sequence of (XPositon, 
   YPosition, Symbol ID) triples. Each triple indicates that the symbol (from 
   some dictionary) specified by "Symbol ID" SHOULD be drawn at the location 
   "(X, Y)". Simply augmenting a text region triple with a fourth component, 
   the colour of that individual character (the symbols "colour tag"), allows 
   storage of the foreground layer in a very small amount of space: using run-
   length coding on those colours. The total space taken by the foreground 
   layer can be as small as a few tens of bytes.
   For example, if the mask layer contained two characters, an "R" in a red 
   colour and a "B" in a blue colour, then the mask layer would decompress to
	   (100, 0, "R")
	   (120, 0, "B")
   and the foreground layer would decompress to
	   ITULAB #7AE29D (corresponding to CIELAB (48.0, 65.5, 48.0), using the 
         default gamut range for ITULAB)
	   ITULAB #3B9F1E (corresponding to CIELAB (23.1, 20.4, -52.1), using the 
         default gamut range for ITULAB)
   or some other suitable representation of the colours, such as indexes into a 
   palette. Matching up the "R" symbol with the colour #7AE29D and drawing the 
   symbol's shape in the red colour gives the correct result. This is a single 
   drawing operation, and is extremely efficient.

E1.7.7.2 Colour Tag Terms of Use in TIFF

   Colour tags are one of the JBIG2 image strip extensions referenced in
   Section E1.6.5 (The JBIG2 Image Strip) of the Profile T extension. Their
   Representation within the image strip is expressed within Section E1.6.5.1
   (Image Strip Format). Stepping back and considering the MRC (Mixed Raster 
   Content) mask (bilevel data) and foreground (colour data) layer pairs, we 
   arrive at the following terms of use to be applied when colour tagging is 
   used in foreground representation:


McIntyre et al.            Expires January 2001                  [Page 48]


Internet Draft            TIFF-FX Extension 1.0                July 2000


     1. the (JBIG2-compressed) bilevel data (position block) SHALL be followed
        immediately (in the file) by the colour tags.  The colour tags SHALL
        appear as an extension in the JBIG2 image strip, with the image strip
        extension type = 1 (colour tags). The colour tags SHALL be compressed
        using ITU-T Rec. T.45.
        the mask IFD points to the start of the bilevel data, and the
        associated byte count SHALL include ONLY the bilevel data (the position
        block, but not the colour tags). The IFD's Compression tag SHALL be set
        to 12 (JBIG2). If present, the T88Options[0] field SHOULD have bit 5
        set to 1 (ColorTagsFolow).
     3. the foreground IFD points to the bilevel data, and the associated byte 
        count SHALL include BOTH the bilevel data and the colour tag extension.
        The IFD's Compression tag SHALL be set to 12 (JBIG2). The IFD's 
        PhotometricInterpretation will indicate the colour space used to
        interpret the colors found in the colour tag data. If present, the 
        T88Options[0] field SHOULD have bit 6 set to 1 (ColorTagsPresent).
     4. in the event that two symbol instances overlap, the reconstructed image 
        SHOULD be the one obtained by drawing each JBIG2 symbol with the 
        appropriate colour, where the drawing SHALL be done in the order that 
        the JBIG2 symbols appear in the encoded JBIG2 image strip.
   Thus, the foreground IFD completely describes an image: it points to enough 
   data to reconstruct a coloured image that contains the right colour at each 
   pixel selected by the mask. It is reasonable that a decoder will recognize 
   that both a mask IFD and a foreground IFD point to the same JBIG2 data, and
   decode the JBIG2 data only once (not once for the mask, and again for the
   foreground). The T88Options[0] bits "ColourTagsFollow" and 
   "ColourTagsPresent" are designed to make the decoder's job easier: if it
   sees ColourTagsFollow in the T88Options[0] field of a mask IFD, it knows it
   should defer decoding it until it decodes the corresponding foreground IFD.

   Similarly, if it sees ColourTagsPresent in a foreground IFD, then it can
   optimize the drawing/decoding operations.

   Note: This representation has two pointers to the same part of the TIFF-FX 
   file, which is a violation of a TIFF guideline, and could conceivably cause 
   problems in some unsuspecting TIFF editors. However, these unsuspecting TIFF 
   editors would probably be confused anyway by the IFD structure required by 
   MRC, let alone the JBIG2 data. The shared pointers occur only in a 
   restricted case.

   The nature of the two pointers is illustrated below:

   Revise the identified Profile M Section 8.4 Rules and Requirements for
   Images as follows:
   a. Revise Rule 1 to read:
      1. If more than one layer exists, then the binary Mask layer SHALL
         be present and be the primary image. The Mask layer SHALL support
         the binary data representations defined in Section 3 and MAY 
         support the binary data representations defined in Sections 4, 5
         and E1.6, with the exception that PhotometricInterpretation MUST be 0. 
         If only one layer exists, then the image corresponding to that 
         layer is the primary image.

E1.8. Security Considerations

   This document describes a file format for Internet fax, which is a
   series of profiles of TIFF for facsimile. As such, it does not create
   any security issues not already identified in [TIFF-REG], in its use
   of fields as defined in [TIFF].  There are also new TIFF fields
   defined within this specification, but they are of a purely
   descriptive nature, so that no new security risks are incurred.

   Further, the encoding specified in this document does not in any way
   preclude the use of any Internet security protocol to encrypt,
   authenticate, or non-repudiate TIFF-encoded facsimile messages.
