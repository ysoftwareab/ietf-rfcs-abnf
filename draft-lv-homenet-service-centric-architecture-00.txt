        Service Centric Networking Architecture for Smart Homes
            draft-lv-homenet-service-centric-architecture-00

Abstract

   We propose a general service centric homenet architecture, which can
   handle the diversity of devices, services, applications and context.
   Especially, we focus on building an overall home network topology,
   routing and naming structures, to fit SCN into a home network.  In
   the future, we will discuss homenet caching, mobility and security in
   details.

1.  Introduction

   Many researchers believe that the legacy IP network architecture is
   not suitable for Internet of Things due to IPv4 address depletion and
   various concerns such as security, overhead and efficiency.  Smart
   home networking is a special scenario of Internet of Things.  We
   believe that the legacy IP network architecture is not suitable.
   Inspired by the recently proposed concept of the content centric
   network, we strongly believe that a simpler but more appropriate
   networking architecture is necessary and important for the success of
   homenets.

   In the homenet, the networked devices have heterogeneous ways of
   connecting to the Internet, often with severe resource constraints
   and many of which are mobile.  Interactions between the applications
   and devices are often real-time and dynamic, requiring strong
   security and privacy protections.  In order to address these
   challenges, we propose a service-centric networking architecture to
   achieve efficient, secure, and reliable networking services for smart
   homes.

1.1.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   Region router: inner routers to deliver contents.

   Homnet gateway: a connection between homenet and outside networks.
   It also performs pre-processing and aggregation of contents.

   ISP gateway: An entity that provides access to the Internet.

   Device: in a smart home network scenario, there are two main kinds of
   devices.  Some of the devices can generate instant content or stream
   content like smoke sensor and surveillance.  The rest devices can
   only perform commands from users or application and change their
   states such as lights, air conditions and fridge.

   CCN: Content Centric Network

   SCN: Service Centric Network

   ISP: Internet Service Provider

   PIT: Pending Interest Table

   CS: Content Storage

   APP: application

   MAC: Media Access Control

2.  Homenet Architecture

2.1.  General Principles

   Home network has driven a huge amount of attentions from both
   researchers and industries.  While home network grows in complexity
   as more smart appliances, sensor and network devices join in, we
   would like to use SCN to fit into home network's scenario which has
   plenty of control information as well as data information.

2.2.  Homenet Architecture

   Based on a state-of-the-art study, we propose following homenet
   topology as a basic model.

   Homenet Gateway has the ability to pre-process and aggregation data
   and then sending to those interested devices.  Homenet gateway will
   hold PIT, FIB and CS tables for sending corresponding message to
   region routers, consumers and outside networks.

   Region routers are located at different regions which could be
   different rooms or floors.  Normally one region will have one sub
   controller as long as the total number of devices is under the
   capacity of the region router.  Region routers only perform the role
   of collecting information and then send them all to the homenet
   gateway for further processing.  They will have PIT, FIB and CS
   tables for sending corresponding message to devices.

   Devices (sensors, applications, users, actuator and so on) are
   connected to their nearest region routers.  Some of them, like
   sensors and users, will produce real time data packet and push them
   to their region routers.  Some of the devices, such as applications
   and users which have special concern, will register their interests
   to region routers and home gateway.  The rest kinds of end devices,
   like furniture and electric appliances, will wait for commands to
   adjust their behaviours.  An end device can perform several roles,
   take a user as an example, the user can push heart beat rate as well
   as ask for room temperature information and then send control
   information to manipulate air condition.

   ISP gateway: The homenet gateway connects to the Internet service
   provider (ISP) gateway, through which the homnet can connect to
   application and end users, who have been authorized, at outside
   internet.

   Devices that generate real time data, such as smoke sensor and
   temperature sensor, will be configured to periodically upload their
   data to a neighbouring region router.  At the same time, those
   sensors can also respond to an interest massage to report their
   current readings.

   Other devices that generate stream content, such as surveillance,
   will store stream data with sequence numbers and waiting for command
   from end user or application.

   A client or application sends interests messages for services to be
   invoked and the results from service execution or state transitions
   are returned in data packet.

2.3.  Homenet Naming

   In smart home network scenario, data is not just retrieved, but can
   be processed before being presented to the user.  Also end users and
   applications can deliver command content.  So we propose to extent
   names not only for content but also for services to be invoked.
   Information generated inside a smart home has finite kinds of types.
   So it is sensible to tailor the naming strategy into the following
   structure:

   'Access scope/service type/device scope/service API/'

   In a service centric network, services may be restricted to only
   local access and/or set for global access through the Internet.
   Also, a service may have strict access control, and temporal or
   physical restrictions in terms of where it can accessed in the smart
   home network.  So the first segment 'access scope' indicates who can
   access this service.  The second level 'service type' shows the type
   of data and it can be instant content, stream content and command
   content.  The third level 'device scope' can accurately locate device
   or a group of devices that provide this service.  The final scope
   'service API' identifies the functional primitives and attributes
   used to interact with the service which can be upload(), switch_on(),
   mode_1() and so on.

   Following are examples of naming messages.

   In order to collect all the smoke condition in the house, Fire Alarm
   broadcasts an instant content interest packet to the network with the
   name of

   '/smarthome/instance/smoke/'

   Smart home Application wants to get access to all the cameras on the
   second floor, a stream content interest is broadcasted to Router B
   with the name of

   '/smarthome/stream/camera/2F'

   Smart home Application wants to send a command to turn off all the
   lights on the second floor

   '/smarthome/command/light/2F/set_state{OFF}';

2.4.  Homenet Routing

   In this architecture, a router maintains a pending interest table
   (PIT) for outstanding forwarded requests, which enables request
   aggregation, to make sure that a router would normally not forward a
   second interest for a specific content in a particular time span.
   The PIT maintains state for all interests and maps them to MAC
   addresses, which are used as unique node identifiers.  Data is then
   routed back on the reverse request path using this state.  Service
   centric network architecture also supports on-path caching and name-
   based security.

   The novelty of this architecture's routing is reflected in the
   following aspects:

   (1) Content pushing is more important than content pulling in some
   smart home scenarios, such as periodically uploading humidity data
   collected by sensors or flooding emergency messages triggered by fire
   alarms.  These contents must be quickly disseminated toward the
   intended locations even though there is no request.  Assuming that
   some sensors lack of storage capacity, the data collected by sensors
   are sent to the nearest router periodically via wire or wireless
   channel to leverage the large storage space of routers.

   (2) A consumer uses interest packet to request content from the
   network.  Following the naming scheme, the consumer declares the
   service type in the name of the interest.  Interest packet is
   broadcasted to all the neighbouring routers.  Different service types
   do not influence the maintenance of PIT table and the forwarding
   scheme, so the architecture has a good compatibility with other
   information centric architectures.

   (3) To solve the problem of control message delivering, a novel
   mechanism is introduced.  A command message generated by a controller
   is seen as an interest packet, known as command content interest.
   The name of the interest is the device name which intends to be
   controlled.  The content requested by the controller is the state of
   the device after the command is successfully delivered.  The command
   content interest follows the same procedure as an ordinary interest
   to realize the delivery of a command.  The command content can also
   be seen as the acknowledgement of a command message.

2.5.  Use Cases

   Three scenarios are discussed to demonstrate the feature of SCN when
   handling different services.

2.5.1.  Smoke Monitering Service

     +----------+              +-------------+
     |  Smoke   |              |  Smart home |
     | Sensor B |              |     APP     |
     +----------+              +-------------+
          \                       /
           \                  (7)/(6)
            \                   /
        +----------+  (3)  +----------+        +----------+
        | Router A |-------| Router B |--------|   Home   |
        |   [CS]   |  (4)  |   [CS]   |        |  Gateway |
        +----------+       +----------+        +----------+
            /                    \
        (1)/                   (5)\(2)
          /                        \
     +----------+              +----------+
     |  Smoke   |              |   Fire   |
     | Sensor A |              |  Alarm   |
     +----------+              +----------+

   STEP 1: Smoke Sensor A periodically uploads the instant smoke data to
   its neighbouring router to leverage the large storage space of Router
   A;

   STEP 2: In order to collect all the smoke condition in the house,
   Fire Alarm broadcasts an instant content interest packet to the
   network with the name of '/smarthome/instance/smoke/';

   STEP 3: On receiving the interest packet from Fire Alarm, Router B
   updates its PIT table and forwards it to Router A;

Internet-Draft           Service Centric Homenet               July 2015


   STEP 4 and 5: After Router A receives the interest packet from Router
   B, the instant smoke content is forwarded to Router B and Fire Alarm
   using the backward route;

   STEP 6 and 7: Suppose that Smart home APP want to request all the
   instant monitoring data in the house, an interest packet is sent to
   Router B with the name of '/smarthome/instance/'.  The smoke content
   data uploaded by Smoke Sensor A is forwarded to APP directly from
   Router B, thanks to the caching scheme of SCN.

2.5.2.  Video Streaming Service

     +----------+              +-------------+
     | Camera A |              |  Smart home |
     | (Floor1) |              |     APP     |
     +----------+              +-------------+
          \                       /
           \                  (6)/(1)
            \                   /
        +----------+  (2)  +----------+        +----------+
        | Router A |-------| Router B |--------|   Home   |
        |   [CS]   |  (5)  |   [CS]   |        |  Gateway |
        +----------+       +----------+        +----------+
            /
        (4)/(3)
          /
     +----------+
     | Camera B |
     | (Floor2) |
     +----------+

   STEP 1: Smart home Application wants to get access to all the cameras
   on the second floor, a stream content interest is broadcasted to
   Router B with the name of '/smarthome/stream/camera/2F';

   STEP 2: On receiving the interest packet, Router B updates its PIT
   table and forwards it to Router A;

   STEP 3 and 4: On receiving the interest packet, Camera B send video
   stream content to Router with the name of '/smarthome/stream/camera/
   2F/caremaB' and an increasing sequence number;

   STEP 5 and 6: The stream content is forwarded to Smart home
   Application using the backward route and is saved by Router A and
   Router B.

     | Light B  |              |  Central |
     | (Floor2) |              |  Monitor |
     +----------+              +----------+

   STEP 1: Smart home Application wants to send a command (eg. turn off)
   to all the lights on the second floor, a command content interest is
   broadcasted to Router B with the name of '/smarthome/command/light/2F
   /' and with the service API's value of 'set_state{OFF}';

   STEP 2: On receiving the interest packet, Router B updates its PIT
   table and forwards it to Router A;

   STEP 3: On receiving the interest packet, Light B changes its state
   into OFF and return a content packet with the name of '/smarthome/
   command/light/2F/lightB' and with the service API's value of
   state{OFF}';

   STEP 4, 5 and 6: The content packet is forwarded to Smart home
   Application using the backward route and is saved by Router A and B;

   STEP 7 and 8: If the Central Monitor want to know the state of all
   the lights in the house, an interest packet is broadcasted with the
   name of '/smarthome/command/light/'.  The state of Light B is
   forwarded to Central Monitor directly from Router B, thanks to the
   caching scheme of SCN.

2.6.  Other Considerations

   Mobility:

   Sensor or end user move around (step between different networks or
   move between different regions), they may need to connect to
   different region routers.  Mobility support for both service

   producers and consumers is required to ensure best connectivity at
   all times.  This includes nomadic movement, seamless mobility to
   handle real-time applications, and vertical handovers between
   different access networks as residents move in and out of their
   region premise.

   Scalability:

   One of the benefits for applying SCN rather than IP is that SCN could
   support as many devices as needed, while IPV4 or IPV6 could run out
   of available addresses.

   Security:

   A new device joins in (public key encrypt, private key decrypt to
   guarantee authority), information or data generated inside the smart
   home should keep confidential and private, and accessible through
   strict access control; it is safer to use SCN than IP architecture.
