                                Abstract 
 
This document defines a framework for the IANA registration of MIME types and 
SDP parameters defined in the ITU V.150.1 recommendation.  For SDP parameters, 
it does not repeat the details of syntax and semantics found in the ITU 
recommendation. For the MIME types, it provides RFC 2048-compliant MIME 
definitions which refer to the ITU V.150.1 recommendation for detailed format 
description. Until the ITU V.150.1 recommendation is ratified, this document 
should be considered work in progress.

1.  Introduction 
 
The ITU V.150.1 recommendation is meant to standardize, in a comprehensive 
manner, the encapsulation of modem signals within IP. This includes both modem 
                                                                                
Kumar et al             September 2002                                                             Page 1                                          
         IANA Registration of ITU V.150.1 MIMEs and SDP parameters 
                                         
                                         
passthrough and modem relay operation. The ITU V.150.1 recommendation has been 
crafted over a period of about two years, and it close to finalization.  
 
This internet draft reflects the consensus of TIA TR.30.1 with regard to the SDP 
parameters and MIME types for modem over IP. This group (TIA TR.30.1) has led 
the development of the V.150.1 recommendation. 
 
This internet draft is initially submitted to the IETF's AVT working group 
because of the presence of new MIME definitions. Review by the IETF's MMUSIC 
working group is also solicited. 
 
The following parameters defined in ITU V.150.1 recommendation need to be 
registered with the  IANA: 
 
  1. New MIME types:   audio/v150mr and audio/v150fw. These indicate media  
     formats defined, in the ITU V.150.1 recommendation, for use in the modem-
     over-IP context. MIME registration applications based on RFC 2048 [4] are 
     in Section 3. These refer to the ITU V.150.1 recommendation for detailed 
     format descriptions and semantics. 
 
  2. New SDP parameters (Section 2). These include a new transport protocol 
     (udpsprt, section 2.1) and several new SDP attributes (Section 2.2). 
     Precise details of their syntax and semantics, found in ITU recommendation 
     V.150.1, are not repeated.

         IANA Registration of ITU V.150.1 MIMEs and SDP parameters 
                                         
                                         
 
2.  Registration of new SDP parameters 
 
2.1 Registration of the  'udpsprt' transport protocol 
 
The 'udpsprt' (Simple Packet Relay Transport over UDP) protocol should be 
registered as a value of the SDP field "proto", referring to the transport 
protocol. 
 
Details of the 'udpsprt' (Simple Packet Relay Transport over UDP) protocol are 
found in [1]. This is a reliable protocol that can be used to efficiently 
guarantee packet delivery in an IP network that is prone to packet loss.  
 
2.2 Registration of new SDP attributes 
 
New SDP attributes defined in ITU V.150.1 [1] should be registered as values of 
the SDP field "att-field".  Details of these attributes, listed below,  are 
found in [1]:  
 
  1. sprtparm, a list of parameters qualifying the 'udpsprt' protocol. 
  2. sprtmap, which dynamically defines a numerical identifier for modem relay 
     packets. 
  3. vndpar (vendor parameters), used to declare vendor-specific parameters. 
 
The SDP attribute 'gpmd' (general-purpose media descriptor) is addressed 
elsewhere [2]. This attribute is used extensively in ITU V.150.1 systems. 
 
3.  Registration of new MIME types 
 
3.1 Registration of the audio/v150mr MIME type 
 
This MIME represents the modem relay packet format as defined in the ITU V.150.1 
recommendation. Hence the suffix 'mr' (modem relay).   
 
     MIME media type name: audio 
      
     MIME subtype name: v150mr 
      
     Required parameters: 
          mr: the type of modem relay, from the set "0" (ITU V.8-compatible)  
          and "1" (universal). 
          mg: the type of media gateway, from the set "0" (No Transcompression), 
          "1" (Single Transcompression) and "2" (Double Transcompression. 
           
     Optional parameters: 
          versn: Version of the ITU V.150 recommendation used. Dotted  
          representation, x.y, where the integer 'x' is the main version  
          number ('1' for V.150.1) and the integer 'y' is the sub-version  
          number.  
          jmdelay: indicates whether the JM delay procedures for end-to-end  
          XID exchange are enabled or not. Permissible values are "yes" and 
          "no".

          mrmods: This parameter lists supported modulation types.  These are 
          listed as one or mote comma-separated elements, where each element is 
          either a single integer or two integers separated by a hyphen. No 
          white space is allowed. The integers, which  designate modulation 
          types are from the set "1" (V.34 duplex), "2" (V.34 Half-duplex), "3" 
          (V.32bis/V.32), "4" (V.22bis/V.22), "5" (V.17), "6" (V.29 half-
          duplex), "7" (V.27 ter), "8" (V.26 ter), "9" (V.26bis), "10" (V.23 
          duplex), "11" (V.23 half duplex), "12" (V.21), "13" (V.90 analog), 
          "14" (V.90 digital), "15" (V.91), "16" (V.92 analog) and "17" (V.92 
          digital). 
          txalgs: This parameter lists supported optional transcompression 
          algorithms, (besides V.42bis, which is mandatory).  These are listed 
          as one or more comma-separated elements. Each element can either be a 
          single integer or two integers separated by a hyphen. No white space 
          is allowed. The integers, which  designate transcompression algorithms 
          are from the set "1" (V.44), "2" (MNP5).  
          v42maxdict: Maximum V.42 dictionary size. Value range and default TBD. 
          v42maxstring: Maximum V.42 string size. Value range and default TBD. 
          v44maxtdict: Maximum V.44 transmit dictionary size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxtstring: Maximum V.44 transmit string size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxrdict: Maximum V.44 receive dictionary size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxrstring: Maximum V.44 receive string size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxthist: Maximum V.44 transmit history size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
          v44maxrhist: Maximum V.44 receive history size. Value range and 
          default TBD. 
           
     Encoding considerations:  
          The  MIME audio/v150mr uses the 'udpsprt' (Simple Packet Relay 
          Transport over UDP) reliable transport protocol as defined in the ITU 
          V.150.1 recommendation. As such, it consists of packets of binary 
          data. 
           
     Security considerations:   
          The privacy and integrity of the data transmitted via V.150.1 modem 
          relay must be ensured at the  application level by means such as 
          encryption. The V.150.1 modem relay protocol does not hinder such end-
          to-end data protection. Nor does it provide any additional, inbuilt 
          safeguards that can be used in the absence of end-to-end, application-
          level data security. The transcompression and other algorithms  used 
          in V.150.1 modem relay are published in various standards and can be 
          implemented by a resourceful attacker. 
 
          Likewise, V.150.1 modem relay procedures do not address session 
          authentication, which must be handled end-to-end by client and server  
          authentication applications. Authentication is out of the scope of a 
          bearer-level protocol such as V.150.1 modem relay. 
           
          Resource usage by a modem relay session may be monitored to prevent 
          denial of service attacks. The resource utilization of modem relay 
          sessions does not exhibit such non-uniformity so as to preclude such 
          resource limiting. 
            
          The MIME type contains no executable content that affects sessions or 
          session legs other than the ones in which the requester is a

          participant. For these session legs, executable content in the form of 
          modem relay control messages is well within the normal prerogatives of 
          the requester.  
           
          Like other  encodings with open-ended content, the ITU V.150.1  
          modem relay format may be abused by hiding data using steganography.  
          However, due to its more limited context, it is unlikely that it  
          will be preferred for such misuse vis-a-vis other audio and video  
          encodings. 
 
     Interoperability considerations: Interoperability is limited to endpoints  
          or gateways that implement the mandatory parts of the ITU V.150.1 
          recommendation, "Procedures for the end-to-end connection of V-series 
          DCEs over an IP Network". Backward compatibility will be maintained 
          between all versions of this recommendation.

     Applications which use this media:   
          Endpoints and media gateways that interface with V-series modems on 
          one end, and with an IP network on the other end. In this case, the 
          on-ramp gateway does not support full modem termination which would 
          have allowed forwarding via a higher-layer protocol.

3.2 Registration of the audio/v150fw MIME type   
 
This MIME represents the format of  messages used to define the contextual 
framework of  information transfer operation as defined in the ITU V.150.1 
recommendation. Hence the suffix 'fw' (framework). 
  
 
     MIME media type name: audio 
      
     MIME subtype name: v150fw 
      
     Required parameters: None.  
      
     Optional parameters: 
          events: The "events" parameter lists the framework event messages 
          supported by the media gateway or endpoint. Events are listed as one 
          or more comma-separated elements. Each element can either be a single 
          integer, or two integers separated by a hyphen.  The latter indicates 
          a range of integers. No white space is allowed in the representation. 
          The integers, which  identify event types are from the set "0" (null), 
          "1" (initial audio), "2" (voice band data), "3" (modem relay), "4" 
          (text relay), "5" (fax relay). When omitted, the default is 0-4.  
           
          expack: indicates whether explicit framework message acknowledgement 
          procedures, as defined in the ITU V.150.1 recommendation are enabled 
          or not. Both sides must enable these procedures in order for them to 
          be used. Permissible values are "yes" and "no". 
 
           
     Encoding considerations:  
          Like all other ITU V.150.1 media formats except modem relay, the MIME 
          audio/v150fw uses the RTP protocol. As such, it consists of packets of 
          binary data. The RTP payload is defined in the ITU V.150.1 
          recommendation. 
           
     Security considerations:   
          As with other RTP formats, it is possible to use IPSEC to ensure the 
          authenticity, integrity and privacy of this media format. Since this 
          media format is uncompressed, there is no potential conflict between 
          compression and encryption. Many applications use modem relay between 
          trusted network equipment and, as such, may forego the use of IPSEC. 
          When used with equipment in untrusted areas, the impact of the V.150 
          framework messages is limited to one session. Hence, any exposure from 
          not encrypting this media format is limited. 
            
          Resource usage by V.150 framework messages may be monitored to prevent 
          denial of service attacks. Since the resource utilization of these 
          messages is minimal, resource limiting is not precluded. 
            
          The MIME type contains no executable content that affects sessions or 
          session legs other than the ones in which the requester is a 
          participant. For these session legs, executable content in the form of 
          V.150 framework messages is well within the normal prerogatives of the 
          requester.

          Since the content associated with this MIME type is well-defined and 
          not open-ended, it is not vulnerable to hiding data using 
          steganography.

4.  Security Considerations 
 
This document does not impose any security considerations of its own, apart from 
the security considerations associated with each MIME type is contains. 
 
Security considerations for SDP parameters defined in this document are 
unchanged from RFC 2327 [3]. 
 
5.  IANA Considerations 
 
The entirety of this document is for IANA review and is limited to such 
information as pertinent to the IANA registration of MIME types and SDP 
parameters.
