qIRC6Ig=
g = granularity of the key (the default of '' = all domain, which
        means that any left-hand-side of the @ is valid with this
        DomainKey)

        (Though not yet defined, one possible interpretation for
        non-empty values is that they could represent a Base64 SHA1
        fingerprint of the email address used to identify the sending
        domain. This, though, does not handle the notion of tagged
        addresses as well as one would like.)

k = key type (rsa = the default)

n = Notes that may be of interest to a human. No interpretation is
        made by any program.

p = public-key data, encoded as a Base64 string. An empty value
        means that this public-key has been revoked.

t = testing mode ('y' means that this domain is testing DomainKeys
        and unverified email should not be treated differently from
        verified email. Recipient systems may wish to track testing
        mode results to assist the sender.)

tag=value pairs separated by semi-colons, e.g.:

    DomainKey-Signature: a=rsa-sha1; s=brisbane; d=example.net; q=dns; c=simple

a = The algorithm used to generate the signature. The default is
        "rsa-sha1", an RSA signed SHA1 digest.

b = The signature data, encoded as a Base64 string.

        Whitespace is ignored in this value and must be removed when
        re-assembling the original signature. This is another way of
        saying that the signing process can safely insert whitespace
        in this value to conform to line-length limits.

c = Canonicalization algorithm. The method by which the headers
        and content are prepared for presentation to the signing
        algorithm. Currently the only valid value is "simple" which
        defines the algorithm described in this document. More
        sophisticated algorithms may evolve as part of the
        trials. There is no default value for this tag.

d = The domain name of the signing domain. At this stage, the
        domain name must match the domain name found in the From:
        header. This tag is largely here to allow extensions that
        allow intermediate domain involvement. There is no default
        value for this tag.

q = The query method used to retrieve the public-key. Currently
        the only valid value is "dns" which defines the DNS lookup
        algorithm described in this document. There is no default
        value for this tag.

s = The selector used to form the query for the public-key. In the
        DNS query type, this value is pre-pended to the "_domainkey."
        namespace of the sending domain. There is no default value
        for this tag.

c=simple; q=dns;
b=dzdVyOfAKCdLXdJOc9G2q8LoXSlEniSbav+yuU4zGeeruD00lszZ
       VoG4ZHRNiYzR;

n = Notes that may be of interest to a human. No interpretation is
        made by any program.

o = Outbound Signing policy ('-' means that this domain signs all
        email, '~' is the default and means that this domain may sign
        some email with DomainKeys)

t = testing mode ('y' means that this domain is testing DomainKeys
        so unsigned and unverifiable email should not be treated
        differently from verified email. Recipient systems may wish to
        track testing mode results to assist the sender.)

        Note that testing mode cannot be turned off by this tag - thus
        policy cannot revert the testing mode setting of a Selector.
