Abstract

   MACE is a reversible transformation method from a sequence of Unicode
   [UNICODE] characters to a sequence of ASCII letters, digits and
   hyphens (LDH characters).  It is designed to be used as an encoding
   for internationalized domain names [IDN].

1. Introduction

   MACE is intended to be used as an ACE in the IDNA architecture
   [IDNA], and encodes a sequence of Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) characters
   in the range U+0000-U+10FFFF as a sequence of LDH characters.

   MACE is designed to have following features:

      Completeness: Every Unicode string has a map to an LDH character
      string.

      Uniqueness: Every Unicode string maps to at most one LDH character
      string.

      Reversibility: The original Unicode string can be obtained from an
      LDH character string to which the Unicode string maps.

      Efficiency: The ratio of encoded size to original size is small.
      If the code points of the Unicode string are clustered, a
      compression algorithm enables a compact encoding.  Even if they
      are not, the encoded size is still kept small.

      Simplicity: The encoding/decoding algorithms are fairly simple to
      implement.


2. Terminology

   LDH characters are the letters A-Z and a-z, the digits 0-9, and
   hyphen-minus.

   As in the Unicode Standard [UNICODE], Unicode characters are denoted
   by "U+" followed by four to six hexadecimal digits representing its
   UCS-4 code point.  A range of Unicode characters is denoted by the
   form "U+xxxx-U+yyyy".


3. Overview

   MACE encodes a sequence of Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) characters in the
   range U+0000-U+10FFFF as a sequence of LDH characters.
   
   MACE is a modal encoding.  There are two major modes and one of which
   has four submodes.  Each character is encoded in a specific
   mode/submode.  The mode/submode is chosen according to the code point


                      Expires December 21th, 2001              [Page  2]

Internet Draft                    MACE                   June 21th, 2001


   of the character and possibly its neiboring characters.  The modal
   encoding enables compact representation of each character, and the
   modes are chosen so that mode change occurs rather infrequently as
   long as the source string is written in a single language.

   LDH characters are represented literally, for the compactness of the
   encoded result.  Other Unicode characters are represented as base32
   format strings.  Each of Unicode characters in Basic Multilingual
   Plane (BMP, U+0000-U+FFFF) except LDH characters is encoded as a
   3-octet base32 format sting, while each non-BMP (U+10000-U+10FFFF)
   character is encoded as a 4-octet base32 format string.

   To achieve fairly good compression for non-LDH charactes, there is
   also a submode for differential encoding.  Using this submode,
   characters are encoded as bitwise-xor value between the code points
   of the previous character and the current character.  In this submode
   a character is encoded as a 1 or 2 octet base32 format string.

   So if the code points of the input string are clusterd in a small
   region, an effective compression algorithm enables 1 or 2
   octets/character encoding (plus some overhead for mode changes).
   Even if the code points are widely scattered and difficult to
   compress (such as CJK Han characters), 3 octets/character (for BMP)
   or 4 octets/character (for Non-BMP) encoding (plus some overhead for
   mode changes) can be achieved.


4. Base32 Format

   MACE uses base32 format string to encode non-negative intergers.  The
   base32 format used for MACE is:

       "0" =  0 = 0x00 = 00000      "g" = 16 = 0x10 = 10000
       "1" =  1 = 0x01 = 00001      "h" = 17 = 0x11 = 10001
       "2" =  2 = 0x02 = 00010      "i" = 18 = 0x12 = 10010
       "3" =  3 = 0x03 = 00011      "j" = 19 = 0x13 = 10011
       "4" =  4 = 0x04 = 00100      "k" = 20 = 0x14 = 10100
       "5" =  5 = 0x05 = 00101      "l" = 21 = 0x15 = 10101
       "6" =  6 = 0x06 = 00110      "m" = 22 = 0x16 = 10110
       "7" =  7 = 0x07 = 00111      "n" = 23 = 0x17 = 10111
       "8" =  8 = 0x08 = 01000      "o" = 24 = 0x18 = 11000
       "9" =  9 = 0x09 = 01001      "p" = 25 = 0x19 = 11001
       "a" = 10 = 0x0A = 01010      "q" = 26 = 0x1A = 11010
       "b" = 11 = 0x0B = 01011      "r" = 27 = 0x1B = 11011
       "c" = 12 = 0x0C = 01100      "s" = 28 = 0x1C = 11100
       "d" = 13 = 0x0D = 01101      "t" = 29 = 0x1D = 11101
       "e" = 14 = 0x0E = 01110      "u" = 30 = 0x1E = 11110
       "f" = 15 = 0x0F = 01111      "v" = 31 = 0x1F = 11111

   The encoding is big-endian (most-significant bits first).  The
   following shows some examples.

5. Notations

   In the following description, following five functions are used.

   base32_encode(N, LEN)
      denotes a base32 format string of LEN octets representing number
      N.  If LEN is larger than what needs to represent N, "0" is
      prepended.

   base32_decode(S)
      denotes a number which corresponds to a base32 format string S.

   codepoint(C)
      denotes a UCS-4 code point value for character C.

   character(N)
      denotes a Unicode character whose UCS-4 code point is N.

   xor(N, M)
      denotes a bit-wise XOR value of integer N and M.


6. Encoding Description

   MACE can encode Unicode/ISO10646 characters in the range
   U+0000-U+10FFFF.  If the input string contains other characters, or
   it represents a non-internationalized host name parts (conforms to
   [STD13]), it MUST NOT be converted.

   MACE has several encoding modes/submodes.  There are two major modes,
   `Literal' and `Non-Literal'.  Non-Literal mode has four submodes,
   while Literal mode has none.  Each character is encoded in a specific
   mode/submode.  The encoding process of a character is:
   
      1. Determine the mode/submode to encode the character.
      2. If and only if it is necessary to change the current mode,
	 output ASCII hyphen-minus to change the mode.
      3. If and only if it is necessary to change the current submode,
	 output the submode introducer octet (described below) to change
	 the submode.
      4. Encode the character in the mode/submode.

   ASCII letter and digit characters are encoded in Literal mode, while
   non-LDH characters are encoded in Non-Literal mode.  ASCII hyphen

   character (U+002D) can be encoded in either modes, and is always
   encoded as a sequence of two hyphen-minus ("--").  Switching between
   Literal mode and Non-Literal mode is indicated by an ASCII hyphen not
   followed by another hyphen.  The initial mode is Non-Literal.

   In Literal mode, characters are encoded as they are.  For example
   ASCII character "a" is encoded as "a".  In Non-Literal mode,
   characters are encoded as a base32 format string.

   Non-Literal mode further comprises four submodes, `BMP-A', `BMP-B',
   `Non-BMP' and `Compress'.  Every non-LDH character is encoded one of
   these submodes.  Shifting to each submode is indicated by a certain
   octet (called introducer octet) shown below.  These introducer octets
   can be distinguished from the base32 string since they never appear
   in the base32 string used by MACE.
   
       submode  introducer octet
      ---------------------------
       BMP-A      "w"
       BMP-B      "x"
       Non-BMP    "y"
       Compress   "z"

   Switching between Literal mode and Non-Literal mode doesn't affect
   current submode, that is, on returning from the Literal mode,
   previous submode is restored.  This lowers the necessity of submode
   changes.  The initial submode is BMP-A.

   BMP-A and BMP-B submodes are used for encoding characters in Unicode
   Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000-U+FFFF), except LDH characters.  In
   these submodes, a character is encoded as base32 format string of 3
   octets.  BMP-A is used for characters in the range U+0000-U+1FFF and
   U+A000-U+FFFF, covering most of Western/Middle-Eastern scripts and
   Hangul.  BMP-B is used for characters in the range U+2000-U+9FFF,
   covering CJK unification area.  Those characters are first mapped to
   integers of the range 0x0000-0x7fff (15bit integer), then converted
   to base32 format string using the following scheme:

      submode  character range  encoding
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      BMP-A    U+0000-U+1FFF	base32_encode(codepoint(C), 3)
	       U+A000-U+FFFF	base32_encode(codepoint(C) - 0x8000, 3)

      BMP-B    U+2000-U+9FFF	base32_encode(codepoint(C) - 0x2000, 3)

   Here are some examples:

      character   submode  integer   base32 string
      ---------------------------------------------
      U+00B0	  BMP-A    0xb0      "05g"
      U+5678	  BMP-B    0x3678    "djo"
      U+BCDE	  BMP-A    0x3CDE    "f6u"

   Non-BMP submode is used for encoding Unicode characters outside Basic
   Multilingual Plane (U+10000-U+10FFFF).  In this mode a character is
   encoded as base 32 format string of 4 octets.  Characters
   U+10000-U+10FFFF are first mapped to intergers of the range
   0x00000-0xFFFFF (20bit integer), then converted to bae32 format
   string using the following scheme:

      submode  character range   encoding
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Non-BMP  U+10000-U+10FFFF  base32_encode(codepoint(C) - 0x10000, 4)
  
   Compress submode is used for the efficient encoding of non-LDH
   characters.  This mode can be used for any non-LDH characters if
   certain condition is met.  In this mode, a character is encoded as a
   bit-wise XOR value between the code point of the character (called C)
   and the last non-LDH character before C (called PREV).  The XOR value
   (xor(codepoint(PREV), codepoint(C))) must be less than 0x200, or the
   Compress submode cannot be used.  If the XOR value is less than 16,
   it is encoded as a base32 format string of 1 octet.  Otherwise 0x200
   is added to the XOR value, then it is encoded as a base32 format
   string of 2 octets.  When decoding, this encoding enables to determine
   the encoded length by looking at the first octet.

      submode   character range  encoding                     condition
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Compress  U+0000-U+10FFFF  base32_encode(X, 1)	      if X < 16   
                                 base32_encode(X + 0x200, 2)  if X >= 16  
   	  [where X is xor(codepoint(PREV), codepoint(C))]

   There are two possible submodes for encoding a non-LDH character C,
   one of which is Compress, and the other is one of the other three
   (BMP-A, BMP-B, Non-BMP).  The submode is determined using the
   following algorithm.  This algorithm is designed so that it chooses
   the submode which produces shorter encoding result.

      1. Let PREV be the last non-LDH character before C, and let NXT be
	 the first non-LDH character after C.  In case C is the first
	 non-LDH character of the input string, let PREV be U+0000.
      2. If xor(codepoint(PREV), codepoint(C)) > 0x1FF, go to 4.
      3. If at least one of the following conditions holds, choose
	 `Compress'.  Otherwise go to 4.
	  a) the current submode is `Compress'
	  b) C is non-BMP character (U+10000-U+10FFFF)

	  c) xor(codepoint(PREV), codepoint(C)) is less than 16
	  d) NXT exists and xor(codepoint(C), codepoint(NXT)) <= 0x1ff
      4. If C is in the range U+0000-U+1FFF or U+A000-U+FFFF, choose
	 `BMP-A'.
      5. If C is in the range U+2000-U+9FFF, choose `BMP-B'.

8. Decoding Description

   Like encoding, MACE decoding process keeps track of the current

   mode/submode to decode each character.  The initial state for
   decoding is the same as that of encoding.

	mode    : Non-Literal
	submode : BMP-A
	PREV    : U+0000

   Because ASCII domain names are case-insensitive, decoding process
   MUST treat uppercase leters and lowercase letters equally.

   The consecutive two ASCII hyphen-minus characters are always decoded
   as a single ASCII hyphen-minus, regardless of the current
   mode/submode.  ASCII hyphen-minus not followed by another
   hyphen-minus indicates mode switching between Literal mode and
   Non-Literal mode.

   In Literal mode, all ASCII letter and digit characters are decoded as
   they are.

   In Non-Literal mode, every character is either a submode introducer
   or a part of base32 format string.  If a character is a submode
   introducer, the current submode is changed to the corresponding
   submode.  If it isn't, it is a part of base32 format string.
   
   To decode base32 format string in a certain submode, first determine
   the length of the string which is decoded to a single Unicode
   character. For submodes other than Compress, the number of octets
   which encodes a character is fixed (3 for BMP-A and BMP-B, 4 for
   Non-BMP).  For Compress submode, the number of octets is variable (1
   or 2), and can be determined by looking at the first octet.  If the
   first octet represents a number less than 16 in base32 (either 0-9,
   a-f or A-F) the number of octets is one, otherwise two.  The
   following list shows the length of the string S and how to get the
   decoded character in each submode.

	submode   length  decoded character             condition
        --------------------------------------------------------------
	BMP-A     3       character(N)                  if N < 0x2000
		          character(N + 0x8000)         if N >= 0x2000
	BMP-B     3       character(N + 0x2000)
        Non-BMP   4       character(N + 0x10000)
	Compress  1       character(xor(P, N))
	          2       character(xor(P, N - 0x200))
	   [where N is base32_decode(S), P is codepoint(PREV)]

   MACE decoding process can accept invalidly-encoded strings as well.
   In order to guarantee the unique mapping, following two types of
   check must be performed.

     1) The decoded string must be checked if it is a [STD13] conforming
        name.  If it is, decoding process MUST fail.

     2) The decoded string must be re-encoded and compared to the input
        string.  If they are not equal (allowing case-difference),
        decoding process MUST fail.


9. Decoding Procedure

   procedure decode(input)
       MODE = `Non-Literal'
       SUBMODE = `BMP-A'
       PREV = U+0000

       while (is_not_empty(INPUT))
	   C = read_one_character(INPUT)
	   if (<C is hyphen>)
	       NXT = read_one_character(INPUT)
	       if (<NXT is hyphen>)
		   output("-")
	       else 
		   <push back NXT to INPUT>
		   if (MODE == `Literal')
		       MODE = `Non-Literal'
		   else
		       MODE = `Literal'
		   endif
	       endif
	   else if (MODE == `Literal')
	       output(C)
	   else if (<C matches one of the submode introducer octets>)
	       SUBMODE = <corresponding submode>
	   else
	       <push back C to INPUT>
	       if (SUBMODE == `BMP-A')
		   S = read_string_of_length(INPUT, 3)
		   V = base32_decode(S)
		   if (V >= 0x2000)
		       V = V + 0x8000
		   endif
	       else if (SUBMODE == `BMP-B')
		   S = read_string_of_length(INPUT, 3)
		   V = base32_decode(S) + 0x2000
	       else if (SUBMODE == `Non-BMP')
		   S = read_string_of_length(INPUT, 4)
		   V = base32_decode(S) + 0x10000
	       else if (SUBMODE == `Compress')
	           if (<C is either 0-9, a-f or A-F>)
		       S = read_string_of_length(INPUT, 1)
		       V = base32_decode(S)
		   else
		       S = read_string_of_length(INPUT, 2)

		       V = base32_decode(S) - 0x200
		   endif
		   V = PREV xor V
	       endif
	       output(character(V))
	       PREV = character(V)
	   endif
       end
   end

   The above decoding procedure accepts invalidly-encoded strings as
   well.  In order to guarantee the unique mapping, following two
   additional checks MUST be performed after decoding:

     1) that the decoding string is NOT a [STD13] conforming name.
     2) that the string which is the result of re-encoding of the
        decoded string matches the original string.

        
10. ACE Identifier

   In order to use MACE as an ACE, there must be a certain prefix or
   suffix string which is unlikely to be used in normal domain names and
   thus identifies MACE-encoded domain name parts.  Since MACE-encoded
   names can begin with hyphen-minus and names beginning with
   hyphen-minus do not conform [STD13], a prefix string should be used.
   So if MACE is used for encoding domain name parts, the encoded names
   should be prefixed by the prefix string.

   This document does not specify the prefix string for MACE.  The
   actual selection should be left to certain authority such as IANA
   [ACEID].

   For testing purpose, there is a registry of test prefix strings for
   ACEs on IETF IDN working group web site [IDN].


11. Examples

   The following examples are meaningless strings, but they are designed
   to exercise various aspects of the algorithm in order to verify the
   correctness of the implementation.

12. Security Considerations

   Users expect each domain name in DNS to be controlled by a single
   authority.  If a Unicode string intended for use as a domain label
   could map to multiple ACE labels, then an internationalized domain
   name could map to multiple ACE domain names, each controlled by a
   different authority, some of which could be spoofs that hijack
   service requests intended for another.  Therefore MACE is designed so
   that each Unicode string has a unique encoding.
