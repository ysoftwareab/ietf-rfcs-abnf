  RBridges: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Support
                    draft-bond-trill-rbridge-oam-01

Abstract

   The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL
   protocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing in
   multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state
   routing protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count.  As
   RBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators will need
   tools for debugging problems that arise.  This document specifies a
   set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and
   maintenance purposes in RBridge campuses.  The features specified in
   this document include tools for traceroute, ping, and error
   reporting.

Internet-Draft            RBridges: OAM Support               March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL
   protocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing in
   multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state
   routing protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count
   (RFCtrill [I-D.ietf-trill-rbridge-protocol]).  As RBridges are
   deployed, operators will face problems that require tools for
   troubleshooting of connectivity issues in the network.  TRILL uses
   IS-IS for the control plane.  IS-IS has a link-state database which
   contains the information of all links in the TRILL domain and IS-IS
   has a routing table.  This information can be used for trouble
   shooting purposes.  Simply being able to view the link-state database
   and routing table is insufficient for the requirements of operations,
   administration, and maintenance (OAM).

   In addition, RBridges should support SNMP, as described in RFCtrill
   [I-D.ietf-trill-rbridge-protocol] and RBridgeMIB
   [I-D.ietf-trill-rbridge-mib].  SNMP, the routing table, and the link-
   state database are insufficient as the only OAM tools because while
   the control plane within an RBridge campus may be functioning
   successfully the data plane may not be.  This motivates the need for
   OAM tools that allow an operator to test the data plane.  Protocols
   such as IP, MPLS, and IEEE 802.1 have features enabling an operator
   to exercise the data plane (RFC 4443 [RFC4443], RFC 0792 [RFC0792],
   IEEE 802.1ag [IEEE.802-1ag]).  There is a need for a similar set of
   tools in TRILL.

   Likewise, there is a need for error reporting capabilities inside an
   RBridge campus.  For instance, if a TRILL Inner.VLAN tag has an
   illegal value there should be a way for devices to report this error.
   This would allow administrators of an RBridge campus to quickly
   locate a problem device in the network.  This document specifies a
   set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and
   maintenance purposes in RBridge campuses along with a frame format.
   The features specified in this document include tools for traceroute,
   ping, and error reporting.  Section 3 of this document specifies the
   general usage of a defined message format.  Section 4 specifies some
   additional applications of the message format.  Section 5 specifies
   the format of the messages on the wire.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  TRILL OAM Message

   To facilitate message passing as needed by the OAM requirements, the
   TRILL OAM Channel ([I-D.eastlake-trill-rbridge-channel]) is utilized.
   The TRILL Header extended flag MAY be set if so desired.

   There are two types of TRILL OAM messages defined in this document
   carried within the TRILL OAM Channel: application and error
   notification.  Frames with an error notification MUST NOT be
   generated in response to frames with an error notification.
   Implementations SHOULD rate limit the origination of error
   notifications.  Whereas unknown unicast frames are sent as multi-
   destination messages, sending unknown unicast frames with an error
   can lead to an amplification attack.  As such special care and rate
   limiting are necessary for error notifications.

   The specification of rate limiting is beyond the scope of this
   document.  An RBridge SHOULD maintain counters for each type of error
   generated.

   Error notification messages contain the error-causing frame or the
   initial part thereof after its OAM message.  The following are two
   figures showing application and error notification message structure.
   Section 5 goes into the details of these formats.

                        Table 1: Frame Field Values

   RBridge campuses do not, in general, guarantee lossless transport of
   frames so a frame containing a TRILL OAM Message, possibly generated
   in response to some other frame, might be lost.

4.  RBridge Tools

   This section specifies a number of RBridge OAM tools.  For
   classification purposes they are divided into two sections,
   applications and error tools.

4.1.  Application RBridge Tools

4.1.1.  Hop Count Traceroute

   The ability to trace the path the data takes through the network is
   an invaluable debugging tool.  RBridge traceroute provides this
   functionality through use of the TRILL OAM message (See Section 3).
   In a hop-count traceroute, the originating RBridge starts by
   transmitting one TRILL data frame with a TRILL OAM message.  This
   message contains a protocol code of an echo request.  (See
   Section 5.2.1.1) The ingress RBridge MUST be the RBridge originating
   the frame.

   When a traceroute is initiated, it is either targeting a known
   unicast target or a multi-destination target as specified by the
   operator.  If the hop-count traceroute is for a known unicast target,
   the egress RBridge is the destination RBridge to which connectivity

Internet-Draft            RBridges: OAM Support               March 2011


   will be checked and the M bit MUST be zero.  Otherwise, if the hop-
   count traceroute is for a multi-destination target, the egress
   RBridge is the distribution tree nickname for the traceroute.  Multi-
   destination targets are handled the same as known unicast targets but
   require a small amount of additional logic as specified in
   Section 4.1.1.1.

   The first echo request frame transmitted MUST have a hop-count of
   one.  The RBridge will continue transmitting these echo requests,
   incrementing the hop-count by one each time until a hop-count error
   notification is received from the destination.  Each of these
   requests in turn will generate a hop-count error notification until
   the egress RBridge is reached.  If a transit RBridge decrements the
   hop-count by more than one it may transmit multiple hop-count error
   notifications.

   The purpose of the traceroute is to confirm connectivity of the data
   plane, and therefore options such as a flow ID or a security option
   MAY be included.  If an RBridge supports equal-cost multi-pathing
   (ECMP) or load balancing, the RBridge SHOULD allow operators to
   specify which flow the traceroute is assigned to.  There is no need
   for all RBridges to use the same assignment method.  Being able to
   specify the flow allows operators to test the path taken by data
   through the data plane.  The purpose of the frame is to mimic a data
   frame that follows the same path through the data plane that a 'real'
   data frame would.

   The echo request MAY have an arbitrary 32-bit unsigned integer
   sequence number to assist in matching reply messages to the request.
   This is important for the hop-count traceroute since replies may
   return to the ingress RBridge in a different order then their
   matching requests were sent.

   The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA, and Inner.MacDA SHOULD default to the
   values specified in Table 1.  RBridges SHOULD provide an option to
   change these values to assign the TRILL data frame to a flow.

   The replying RBridge MUST include its 16-bit port ID from the port on
   which the hop-count error generating frame was received in the
   incoming port field of the reply.  It MUST also include its 16-bit
   port ID from the port on which the frame would be forwarded if the
   frame did not have a hop-count error.  A port ID of 0xFFFF indicates
   the frame was consumed by the RBridge itself.  Finally the reply MUST
   include the 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge the frame would
   have been sent to if there were no error.  If the request is a multi-
   destination frame, this field MUST be set to the nickname of the
   RBridge the frame was received from.  This is the previous hop
   RBridge.  This is to facilitate knowledge of a more precise path

   through the campus as seen in RFC 5837 [RFC5837].

   The advantage of this traceroute method is the transit RBridges do
   not have to do any special processing of the frames until a hop-count
   error is detected, a condition they are required to detect by the
   TRILL base protocol.  The disadvantage is the request-orginating
   RBridge needs to transmit as many frames as there are hops between
   itself and the destination RBridge.

   The end stations are not involved in this process.  RBridge
   traceroutes are from RBridge to RBridge.  While the frames sent may
   emulate data sent from ESa to ESb, the end stations are not, in fact,
   involved.

4.1.1.1.  Multi-Destination Targets

   For multi-destination targets at each branch in the tree the tagged
   frame will be replicated causing each RBridge in the tree, possibly
   pruned by VLAN and/or multicast group, to send a response to the echo
   request.  If all RBridges in the possibly pruned distribution tree
   support the echo request message, then the ingressing RBridge will
   receive an echo reply from each of them.  This is in contrast to a
   known unicast tagged frame where only the RBridges along the path
   from ingress to egress transmit the error notification.  The
   ingressing RBridge can compile all of these replies, using the parent
   pointers located in the nexthop nickname field, into an output of the
   tree the traffic traversed.  In the case that a non-valid
   distribution tree nickname is specified the traceroute frames SHOULD
   still be generated.  The traceroute application MUST report any
   errors received, such as an invalid distribution tree nickname,
   caused by the hop-count traceroute frames.  RBridges receiving a
   multicast destination echo request MUST NOT transmit an echo reply if
   the multi-destination bit is set.  Echo requests that are not used
   with the hop-count traceroute come from the ping tool, and pings are
   not valid to multi-destination traffic.  In a hop-count traceroute
   devices will already be transmitting a hop-count error notification
   and so there is no reason to transmit a double set of replies.  A
   multi-destination hop-count traceroute does not stop when an echo
   reply is received.  It stops when the transmitted hopcount reaches
   0x3F.

4.1.1.2.  Hop Count Traceroute Example

   Figure 3 contains a campus with three RBridges.  Consider a hop-count
   traceroute from RB0 to RB2.

                   Hop Count Traceroute Example Topology

                                 Figure 3

   In this diagram RB0 transmits frame (1) destined to RB2.  This frame
   contains the echo request message and a hop-count of 0.  When RB1
   receives this frame it drops it and transmits a hop-count-exceeded
   message, (2), to RB0.  RB0 then transmits a frame, (3), with a hop-
   count of 1.  RB1 decrements this hop-count by 1 to 0 and forwards it
   to RB2.  RB2 drops frame (3) and transmits a hop-count-exceeded
   message, (4), to RB0.  The traceroute is now complete.

   Below are some select fields for the frames:

   For example, if the nicknames for RB0, RB1, and RB2 are 0x0001,
   0x0002, and 0x0003 respectively, the console output from such a trace
   might be:

               Table 3: Hop Count Traceroute Example Output

   In this example, the first line of output is generated from local
   information, no hop-count frames are sent to generate it.

4.1.2.  RBridge Ping

   Ping is a tool for verifying RBridge connectivity.  As with an
   RBridge traceroute, the ping-originating RBridge transmits one or
   more TRILL data frames with a TRILL OAM message.  This message
   contains the code of an echo request (See Section 5.2.1.1).  The
   ingress RBridge MUST be the RBridge-originating frame.  The egress
   RBridge is the destination RBridge to which connectivity will be
   checked.  The M bit MUST be zero.

   As with RBridge traceroute, options such as a flow ID or a security
   option MAY be included.  If an RBridge supports equal-cost multi-
   pathing (ECMP) or load balancing, the RBridge SHOULD allow operators
   to specify which flow the ping is assigned to.  There is no need for
   all RBridges to use the same assignment method.  This ping traffic,
   once again, will mimic real traffic through the network, like
   traceroute traffic as previously specified in Section 4.1.1.

   The echo request MAY have an arbitrary 32-bit unsigned integer
   sequence number to assist in matching reply messages to the request.
   In most circumstances, a single echo request is needed to complete
   the ping but it might be desirable for a single RBridge to ping
   multiple egress RBridges, or trace differing flows simultaneously.
   Assigning differing sequence numbers to each frame aids in matching

Internet-Draft            RBridges: OAM Support               March 2011


   which trace the reply belongs to.

   The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA, and Inner.MacDA SHOULD default to the
   values specified in Table 1.  RBridges SHOULD provide the ability to
   change these values as to assign the TRILL data frame to a flow.  The
   payload of the frame is arbitrary and MAY contain any value.  This
   value can have an influence on which flow the frame is assigned to.

   RBridges implementing ping MAY issue a reply in response to this
   request.  See Section 8 for reasons on some RBridges are allowed to
   choose not to respond to a request.  If an RBridge chooses to respond
   to the request, the reply MUST consist of one TRILL data frame per
   request with an OAM message containing the protocol code of an echo
   reply.  The echo reply MUST have the same sequence number as the
   request being matched.

   For the echo reply the ingress RBridge field MUST be the reply-
   originating RBridge's nickname.  The egress RBridge MUST be the
   request-originating RBridge's nickname.  The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA,
   and Inner.MacDA SHOULD default to the values specified in Table 1.
   The Outer.VLAN ID MUST be preserved.  The M bit MUST be zero.

   The reply-originating RBridge MUST include its 16-bit port ID from
   the port on which the request was received in the incoming port field
   of the reply.  It MUST also include its 16-bit port ID from the port
   on which the frame is forwarded.  A port ID of 0xFFFF indicates the
   frame was consumed by the RBridge itself.  The nickname field in the
   generated frame MUST be set to all zeros on transmission and ignored
   on reception.

   The Internal Hop Count field of the reply MUST be set to zero.  The
   ping functionality does not use the Internal Hop Count field of the
   reply.  (See Section 5.2.1.2)

   The reply frame need not follow the same path though the campus.  The
   reply messages are not meant to test the data plane.

   End stations are not involved in this the ping process.  RBridge
   pings are from RBridge to RBridge.  While the frames sent may emulate
   data sent from ESa to ESb, the end stations are not, in fact,
   involved.

   The transmitting RBridge MUST wait for a reply frame until a time-out
   occurs.  At that time, the RBridge MUST assume the frame was lost,
   and this MUST be indicated to the operator.  The length of this time-
   out is not specified in this document.

                                 Figure 4

   In this diagram RB0 transmits frame (1) destined to RB2.  This frame
   contains the echo request message.  When RB1 receives this frame it
   forwards it to RB2.  When RB2 receives this frame it transmits and
   echo reply frame (2) destined to RB0.  RB1 receives this frame and
   forwards it to RB0.

   Below are some select fields for the frames:

   +--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
   |  Frame |   Ingress   |    Egress   |   TRILL OAM   |   Sequence   |

   In this example, the ping was repeated three times with the sequence
   number being changed each time.

4.2.  Error Reporting

   Errors can occur through the reception of TRILL data frames.  For
   this purpose, the error notification format is specified.  These are
   generated due to various events as specified subsequently.  When a
   TRILL data frame is received with an error, an error notification
   frame MAY be generated.  See Section 8 for reasons on some RBridges
   are allowed to choose not to respond to a request.  The generated
   reply MUST contain the error notification.  The sub-code MUST contain
   a code specifying the error encountered.  The valid values are
   specified in Section 5.2.2.1.  Two of these sub-codes contain TLVs
   with additional information.  The error notification also contains a
   3 bit error type field which describes the error.

   This frame has a TRILL header and it contains, as its payload, the
   frame received with the error.  If the size of the received frame
   would cause the generated frame to exceed 1470 bytes, the payload
   MUST be truncated to the 1470 bytes.  The payload MUST include the
   TRILL header of the received frame and MUST NOT include the link-
   layer header.  The generated reply MUST contain the error
   notification message specific to the error.

   When the original ingress RBridge receives the error frame, at a
   minimum, the RBridge SHOULD update a counter specifying the number of
   error frames received for the causing error.  The encapsulated frame
   MUST NOT be decapsulated and transmitted.  The RBridge SHOULD also
   keep a set of counters for errors reported by other RBridges.

   The two sub-codes that contain TLVs with additional information are
   described below.  All other sub-codes specified in this document do
   not contain TLVs.

4.2.1.  Hop Count Zero Error

   When a TRILL data frame is received with a hop-count of zero, an
   error notification frame MAY be generated.  The generated reply MUST
   contain the hop-count zero error sub-code.  If the received frame has

Internet-Draft            RBridges: OAM Support               March 2011


   the echo request message, the hop-count zero error notification MUST
   have a sequence number matching the echo request.  Otherwise, the
   sequence number MUST be set to zero.  The incoming port ID MUST be
   the port ID the received frame arrived on.  The outgoing port ID MUST
   be the port ID of the port the received frame would have been
   forwarded onto if the hop-count was not zero.  Finally, the error
   notification MUST include the 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge
   the frame would have been sent to.  If the request is a multi-
   destination frame, this field MUST be set to all zeros on
   transmission and ignored on reception.  If the RBridge transmitting
   the request is the egress RBridge, this field MUST be set to 0x0000.

4.2.2.  MTU Error

   When a TRILL data frame is received with a payload that would exceed
   the MTU of the port the frame would otherwise be forwarded to, an
   error notification frame MAY be generated.  The generated reply MUST
   contain the MTU error sub-code.  The outgoing port MTU field MUST
   have the MTU of the port the frame would have otherwise been
   transmitted on.  The incoming port ID MUST be the port ID the
   received frame arrived on.  The outgoing port ID MUST be the port ID
   of the port the received frame would have been forwarded onto if the
   frame size was not too large.  Finally, the error notification
   message MUST include the 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge the
   frame would have been sent to.  If this is a multi-destination frame
   this field MUST be set to all zeros on transmission and ignored on
   reception.  If the RBridge transmitting the request is the egress
   RBridge, this field MUST be set to 0x0000.

5.2.2.1.  Error Specifiers

   The sub-code values fall into three categories: errors, warnings, and
   comments.  All sub-codes represent something out of the ordinary that
   has gone wrong, but certain ones are more important than others.
   Sub-codes that are classified as errors are the most severe with
   warning sub-codes being slightly less severe.  These are enabled by
   default.  Sub-codes classified as comments are minor and are disabled
   by default.  They may be useful for operators debugging a network.
   All error generations are optional and therefore MAY be generated or
   not generated depending on security and implementation constraints.

   The error specifiers sub-code values are:

   Sub-codes

   o  0: Unknown Error: Indicates an error has occurred.

   o  1: Corrupt Frame: Frame received with invalid FCS or that was not
      an 8-bit multiple in length.  It could be impossible for a device
      to signal this if the low-level port hardware hides this from the

5.3.  Type, Length, Value (TLV) Encodings

   To facilitate future interoperable expansion of the data carried in
   OAM sub-messages some sub-messages use a TLV encoding.  These TLV
   sections consist of a list of type, length, value encoded data where
   the type signals to the RBridge how to interpret the value, and the
   length tells the RBridge the length of the value in bytes.  The type
   and length are both 8 bit fields.  A length of zero indicates the
   value is a UTF-8 string with a NULL ('\0') terminating byte.
   Preceeding the list of TLVs is a 16 bit total length field which
   specifies the total length of all the length fields in octet units.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is request to create a new subregistry within the TRILL
   Parameter registry for "TRILL OAM Message Error Sub-Message Error
   Specifiers".  This subregistry that is initially populated as
   specified in Section 5.2.2.1.  Additional values are allocated by
   IETF Review [RFC5226].

   IANA is requested to create a new subregistry within the TRILL
   Parameter registry for "TRILL Error Reporting Protocol TLV Types"
   with initial values as listed in Section 5.3.  Additional values are
   allocated by IETF Review [RFC5226].

   This draft also requires action to reserve the TRILL OAM Control
   Channel protocol codes.IANA is requested to allocate the TRILL OAM
   Channel protocol codes for as listed in Section 5.1.

8.  Security Considerations

   The nature of the TRILL OAM Message lends itself to security
   concerns.  By providing information about the topology of a network,
   attackers can gain greater knowledge of a network in order to exploit
   the network.  Passive attacks such as reading frames with an OAM
   message could be used to gain such knowledge or active attacks where
   an attacker mimics an RBridge can be used to probe the network.
   Authentication, data integrity, protection against replay attacks,
   and confidentiality for TRILL OAM frames may be provided using a to-
   be-specified TRILL Security Option.  Using such a security option
   would mitigate both the passive and active attacks.

   For instance, data origin authentication could be provided in the
   future using a security options in the TRILL Header by verifying a
   hash using shared keys or a mechanism like SEND with CGA.  To prevent
   replay attacks rate limiting, sequence numbers as well as some nonce
   based mechanism could be provided.  Confidentiality for TRILL OAM
   frames could be provided based on some future security option
   extension which encypts TRILL frames.

   In a network where one does not wish to configure a security option,
   the threat of attackers is still present.  For this reason,
   generation of any TRILL OAM Message frames is optional and SHOULD be
   configurable by an operator on a per RBridge basis.  An RBridge MAY
   have this configurable on a per port basis.  For instance, an
   operator SHOULD be able to disable hop-count traceroute reply
   messages or error notification message generation per port.

   Another security threat is denial of service through use of OAM
   messages.  For this reason, RBridges MUST rate limit the generation
   of OAM message frames.  For multi-destination frames, the frames MAY
   be discarded silently to prevent any denial of service atacks in case
   of an errored packet such as an 'options not recognized' error
   notification.
