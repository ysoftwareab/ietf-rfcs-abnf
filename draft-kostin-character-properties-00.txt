Abstract

     (Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is used hereinafter.)
     This document describes an enhancing of symbolic name way of 
character references in HTML by adding to a character symbolic name an 
optional character property in the following manner: BNF: "&<character 
symbolic name>[<separator><character property>];".

Introduction

     Dear Sirs,

     It seems likely that method of encoding characters in operating 
systems becomes more and more similar to character entity references 
implemented in HTML by notation: BNF: "&<character symbolic name>;" (see 
ref. [1] below) (notation, probably, originated from SGML (for SGML, see 
ref. [3] below)). Especially this process becomes apparent in UTF-8 
sequences. At the days of writing this document the symbolic name is not 
yet become a method of encoding in operating systems. Probably, the way 
of implementing this method inside operating systems lies over prior 
trial in HTML.

     This document describes an enhancing character reference method 
(the method by which characters are encoded in HTML (see ref. [1] 
below)) by supplying a character reference with an optional character 
property. The character property gives/bears additional information 
about a character specified by a character reference; the information 
which is rather applicable to that single character only then to a 
string of text containing this character. In particular, this means that 
a value of some character property can differ just within one character 
of a word (of a sentence or a paragraph) and therefore (but not only) 
setting this information by character property way is more convenient 
then by such a way as, for example, HTML-tags. Another reason why some 
information could be set by character property is necessity to keep that 
information in as short text fragment as just a word, i. e. to provide 
ability to handle this information without parsing the whole document.

        times.

<ABL> - defines right angle bracket i. e. ">".
<SBL> - defines left square bracket i. e. "[".

CHAPTER 2 - CHARACTER PROPERTIES FOR CHARACTER REFERENCES




                          CHAPTER 2, DIVISION 1
                        CHARACTER PROPERTY SYNTAX


(002.001.001.0001 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 1)

     The character property is added after specified symbolic name 
separated from the symbolic name (or from another character property) by 
a special character, property's separator.

(002.001.001.0002 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 2)

     NOTE: A hyphen, minus ("-") sign, is reserved for using inside the 
character property, for example to separate subtags of a language name 
as in RFC 3066 (see ref. [5] below), and also for using inside symbolic 
names (see also 002.001.001.0004).

(002.001.001.0003 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 3)

     BNF: &<symbolic name>{<separator><character property>};

(002.001.001.0004 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 4)

     The character property always is an optional parameter; otherwise 
it is not already a property of a character; it is then a part of a 
symbolic name of a character reference.

(002.001.001.0005 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 5)

     A value of the character property is applied to a specified 
character only and has a higher priority then values set by such 
elements as for example HTML-tags.

(002.001.001.0006 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 6)

     NOTE: It is not recommended to override default values by using the 
character property statement because of difficulties arising for web-
searching for characters with a specific character property value and 
because of possible conflict with values of another origin for example 
with values of HTML-tags. See also Introduction.

002.001.002 - CHARACTERS USED TO COMPOSE THE CHARACTER PROPERTY ITSELF


(002.001.002.0001 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 1)

     The character property is composed of ASCII characters, the 
characters which form a primordial, thoroughly tested set of characters 
for Internet so far (for ASCII, see ref. [4] below), excluding:
1. (excluding) ASCII-characters used as character property separators
   (to avoid confusion with the beginning of another character 
   property) (e. g. a comma (",") is a language property separator),
2. (excluding) the "&" ASCII-character
   (used as delimiter of the beginning of another character reference 
   (ref. [1] below)),
3. (excluding) the ";" ASCII-character
   (used as delimiter of the end of the character reference (ref. [1] 
   below)).

(002.001.002.0002 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 2)

     So list of characters surely allowable for now for composing 
character properties looks as follows:
     A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
     a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -
     and also following characters, just to make sure, (they are ASCII-
characters too):
     _ (low line) ' (apostrophe)

(002.001.002.0003 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 3)

     SOAP NOTE: There are some ASCII-characters used in CGI form data 
sets. They are: the "%" ASCII-character (indicates a beginning of a 
character triplet notation), the "+" ASCII-character (replaces in form 
data set a space characters). (See ref. [6] below.) Also, there is the 
character "#" which is used in World Wide Web and in other systems to 
separate a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier. Such characters are 
often called unsafe. But it doesn't matter that these characters could 
be presented in a character reference because they may be encoded by a 
character triplet: BNF: "%<two hexadecimal digits code of ASCII-
character>". E. g. a plus ("+") sign may be represented by the "%2B". 
Unlike good UNICODE-characters, for any ASCII-character, two hex. digits 
are completely enough to represent its code.

(002.001.002.0004 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 4)

     Character properties are case-sensitive, syntactically, because XML 
is case-sensitive.
