      Solutions for the authorization in constrained environments
                     draft-cuellar-ace-solutions-00

Abstract

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a transfer protocol
   that was designed to meet the special requirements of constrained
   environments.

   This document introduces a common framework for conveying
   authorization information between the actors in the ACE architecture
   by defining classes of message types.  It thus specifys a common
   authorization extension for CoAP.

1.  Introduction

   Resource-constrained nodes only have limited system resources such as
   memory, stable storage (such as disk space) and transmission capacity
   and often lack input/output devices such as keyboards or displays.
   They are often especially designed to perform a single, simple task
   in their application area.  The various use cases (see
   [I-D.ietf-ace-usecases]) have varying requirements for the
   authentication and authorization solution.  Due to the
   constrainedness of the devices, a single solution cannot address all
   these requirements.

   In the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
   (ACE) working group, various proposals are discussed that cover
   different use-cases and application scenarios.  This document
   explains how the specific solutions in the ACE WG fit together in a
   common framework.  It defines classes of message types to convey
   authenticated authorization information between the actors in the ACE
   architecture.  [I-D.ietf-ace-actors]

   The description of each message type covers the effect this message
   has, the actors that send and receive the message and the kind of
   protection it requires.  Solution designer can implement the message
   type classes with the effect they require for their solution.

1.1.  Terminology

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-actors].

2.  Overview

   The ACE architecture as outlined in [I-D.ietf-ace-actors] introduces
   six actors - logical entities that have to perform specific security-
   related tasks; On the constrained level, client and server want to
   communicate securely.  Their respective principals define
   authorization policies that need to be enacted.  Each constrained
   device has a less-constrained device that can be entrusted with
   security-related tasks.  One goal of the ACE WG is to enable entities
   on the constrained level to securely delegate some authorization-
   related tasks to an actor on the less-constrained level within the
   same security domain.

   The ACE architecture facilitates various distinct application
   scenarios resulting in the following basic authorization message
   flows.

   1.  To access a resource on a server, the client presents an
       authorization token together with the request.

   2.  When a client tries to access a resource on a server, the server
       retrieves authorization information for this action.

   3.  The server disseminates encrypted data where the decryption key
       is bound to the client's authorization.

   In all cases, the authorization policies of both the client's
   principal and the server's principal must be considered to achieve
   their respective security goals.  Depending on the selected
   authorization message flow, different actors need to exchange
   different information.

   This document is structured as follows: Section 3 specifies 11
   classes of Message Types that define how this information is securely
   conveyed over the network.  Section 4 describes CoAP content formats
   that can be used to control the desired authorization message flow.

3.  Message Type Classes

   In the following, the classes of message types for authorization are
   listed.  Each class consists of the effect this message has, the
   actors that send and receive this message, and the kind of protection




Gerdes, et al.           Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                ace-solutions                 October 2015


   that such a message requires.  Solutions can choose the message types
   they need to implement based on the effects they require.

3.1.  Unauthorized Resource Request Message

   Any resource request from C to S that is not covered by a valid
   ticket for C is treated as unauthorized request.  If S decides to act
   upon an Unauthorized Resource Request it can reject the message and
   optionally inform C where it can ask for authorization, or, if S has
   authenticated C, S can directly ask SAM to authorize C's request.

3.1.1.  Effect

   o  S can act on the unauthorized request to determine if C is
      authorized, either by requesting authorization from SAM or by
      rejecting the request and optionally inform C about which SAM to
      contact in order to retrieve a valid authorization token.

   o  If S happens to be a gateway (GW) that serves content on behalf of
      another entity (called "origin server"), GW can act as previously
      described for S.

3.1.2.  Actors

   o  C -> S

   or, optionally,

   o  C -> GW

3.1.3.  Protection Requirements

   None.

3.2.  SAM Information Message

   A SAM Information Message can be used by S or a gateway (GW) that
   serves the requested resource on behalf of an origin server S to
   instruct C where it may retrieve authorization for a specific type of
   request.  S (or GW, respectively) may optionally include requested
   data as an encrypted object with the SAM Information Message.

3.2.1.  Effect

   o  C knows the address of SAM (where to request a ticket for S).

Internet-Draft                ace-solutions                 October 2015


3.2.2.  Actors

   o  S -> C

   or optionally,

   o  GW -> C

3.2.3.  Protection Requirements

   If S/GW includes requested data with the SAM Information Message, it
   must provide for confidentiality and integrity of the data.

3.3.  CAM Information Message

   A CAM Information Message can be used by C to instruct S where it may
   retrieve an authorization token for C.

3.3.1.  Effect

   o  S knows the address of CAM (where to request a ticket for C).

3.3.2.  Actors

   o  C -> S

3.3.3.  Protection Requirements

   None.

3.4.  Access Request Message

   An Access Request Message is sent by C to request CAM to retrieve
   authorization information for a specific request.  It includes
   information from a SAM Information message generated by S/GW.

3.4.1.  Effect

   o  CAM knows the resources and actions C is requesting.

   o  CAM knows which SAM to contact.

3.4.2.  Actors

   o  C -> CAM

Internet-Draft                ace-solutions                 October 2015


3.4.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Integrity and Authenticity (CAM can validate that the message
      stems from C)

   o  Confidentiality (optional): the principals may not want others to
      know which resources and actions where requested.

3.5.  Ticket Request Message

   A Ticket Request message is sent by CAM on behalf of C to retrieve
   authorization from SAM for a specific action on S.

3.5.1.  Effect

   o  SAM knows which actions on which resources are requested by CAM.

   o  SAM can determine permissions for CAM.

   o  SAM can generate an access ticket for C, which can be later used
      by C to demonstrate to S its authorization status.

   o  SAM can generate a verifier for C, which can be later used by C to
      verify that it is communicating with an appropriate S.

3.5.2.  Actors

   o  CAM -> SAM

3.5.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Integrity and authenticity (SAM can validate that the message
      stems from CAM)

   o  Confidentiality (optional): the principals may not want others to
      know which resources and actions where requested.

3.6.  Ticket Grant Message

   A Ticket Grant message is sent by SAM to CAM to convey authorization
   information and a verifier that can be used by C to access protected
   resources on S.

3.6.1.  Effect

   o  CAM received the Server Authorization Information (SAI)

   o  CAM received the verifier for C

Internet-Draft                ace-solutions                 October 2015


   o  CAM can validate the origin of the ticket for C

3.6.2.  Actors

   o  SAM -> CAM

3.6.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Confidentiality (SAM, CAM) (+ Integrity (implicit, the ticket
      already is integrity-protected))

   o  SAM knows the principal's authorization policies for CAM

3.7.  Ticket Transfer Message

   The Ticket Transfer message is used by CAM to convey the
   authorization information and the verifier retrieved from SAM to C.

3.7.1.  Effect

   o  C is able to prove its authorization status to S

   o  C is able to communicate securely with S

3.7.2.  Actors

   o  CAM -> C

3.7.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Confidentiality (CAM, C) (+ Integrity if the ticket not already is
      integrity-protected)

3.8.  Client Authorization Information Message

   CAM can restrict the operations C performs on S by transferring
   Client Authentication Information (CAI) to C.  This is specifically
   useful if S has requested additional information from C in order to
   proceed with C's initial request.

3.8.1.  Effect

   o  C gets the client authorization information (CAI) received from
      CAM

   o  C knows which information it is allowed to provide to S

Internet-Draft                ace-solutions                 October 2015


3.8.2.  Actors

   o  CAM -> C

3.8.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Integrity: attackers must not be able to manipulate the CAI.

   o  Confidentiality (optional): in some cases, principals might not
      want others to gain knowledge of the CAI.

   o  CAM knows the principal's authorization policies for C.

3.9.  Security Context Setup Between CAM and SAM

   In the ACE architecture, the client may utilize an authorization
   manager (CAM) to contact the server-side authorization manager (SAM)
   and retrieve an authorization token for the intended action on a
   resource that SAM is responsible for.  CAM needs to authenticate with
   SAM on behalf of C and must authenticate SAM.  The message exchange
   between CAM and SAM establishes a security context that can be used
   to request authorization for CAM and transfer authorization policies
   for SAM.

3.9.1.  Effect

   o  Mutual authentication (TODO: split)

   o  CAM can authenticate messages from SAM

   o  SAM can authenticate messages from CAM

   o  SAM can determine authorization policies for CAM

   o  CAM can determine authorization policies for SAM

3.9.2.  Actors

   o  CAM <-> SAM

3.9.3.  Protection Requirements

   None.

Internet-Draft                ace-solutions                 October 2015


3.10.  Security Association between C and S

   Once C has been authorized by SAM to access resources on S and by CAM
   to transmit data to S, both actors have a common security context
   that can be used to exchange further messages.  The authorization
   information bound to this security context can be updated
   subsequently over a suitable interface provided by C and S.

3.10.1.  Effect

   o  C can authenticate messages from S

   o  S can authenticate messages from C

   o  Further communication between C and S can be encrypted

   o  S knows the SAI for C

3.10.2.  Actors

   o  C, S

3.10.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Integrity: Attackers must not be able to update the authorization
      information stored at S and C.

   o  Confidentiality (optional): Usually, only entities that are
      authorized to update the authorization information should be able
      to read that data.

3.11.  Authorized Resource Request Message

   Within the security association between C and S, request messages
   covered by the authorization information that is bound to the common
   security context are Authorized Resource Request messages that the
   receiver is allowed to process.

3.11.1.  Effect

   o  S can process requests from C, C can process requests from S.

3.11.2.  Actors

   o  C -> S

Internet-Draft                ace-solutions                 October 2015


3.11.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Integrity

   o  Confidentiality (optional): the principals might not want others
      to know the requested resource.

3.12.  Resource Response Message

   Responses to Authorized Request messages are Resource Responses.

3.12.1.  Effect

   o  C recieves the requested service from S.

3.12.2.  Actors

   o  S -> C

3.12.3.  Protection Requirements

   o  Integrity

   o  Confidentiality (optional): the principals might not want others
      to know the response content.

3.13.  Server-Initiated Ticket Request Messages

   TODO (see [I-D.gerdes-ace-dcaf-sitr])

4.  Content Format

   As the ACE working group aims at an authorization solution that
   follows a REST architecture style, the basic message flow is
   controlled by the content format that is used to convey
   authorization-specific data.  For example, S might transfer the SAM
   Information message in content format 'application/cose+cbor' to
   indicate its capability of handling messages that use the COSE
   message syntax [I-D.ietf-cose-msg], or 'application/dcaf+cbor' to use
   the DCAF messaging format specified in
   [I-D.gerdes-ace-dcaf-authorize].

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
