                 Abstract  
                     
                    This document proposes a private SIP extension header P-Charging-
                    Function-Addresses used to pass the addresses of entities that 
                    provide a charging function. There is a need in the Third 
                    Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for entities that process 
                    charging information. For a particular dialog or standalone 
                    transaction, a proxy (or UA within the network, e.g. a gateway) may 
                    need to pass information to one or more charging entities. The 
                    affected UAs and proxies associated with the dialog or standalone 
                    transaction need to know the identities or addresses of the 
                    appropriate charging entities.  
                     
                    This document also proposes a private SIP extension header P-
                    Charging-Vector to pass correlation information for charging 
                    purposes. The network entities in the 3GPP architecture share 
                    correlation information to ensure that charging activities are 
                    coordinated.  The need applies for any SIP method used to initiate 
                    a dialog, standalone messages and some response messages.

                 1. Background  
                         
                    3GPP has defined a distributed architecture that results in 
                    multiple network entities becoming involved in providing access and 
                    service. Operators need the ability and flexibility to charge for 
                    the access and services as they see fit.  This requires 
                    coordination among the network entities, which includes correlating 
                    charging records generated from different entities that are related 
                    to the same session.  There is a need to inform each network entity 
                    involved about common charging functions to receive the generated 
                    records. 
                     
                    The solution provided by 3GPP is to define a two types of charging 
                    functions: Charging Collection Function (CCF) and Event Charging 
                    Function (ECF). CCF is used for off-line charging and ECF is used 
                    for on-line charging. There may be a primary and secondary CCF and 
                    ECF, for redundancy purposes. The CCF and ECF addresses may be 
                    passed during the establishment of a dialog or standalone 
                    transaction. The details are specified in the 3GPP documents, see 
                    3GPP TS 32.200 [6]. 
                     
                    Additionally, a charging vector is defined that may be filled in 
                    during the establishment of a dialog or standalone transaction.  
                    The information inside the charging vector may be filled in by 
                    multiple network entities and retrieved by multiple network 
                    entities.  There are three types of correlation information to be 
                    passed: IMS Charging ID (ICID), Inter Operator Identifiers (IOI) 
                    and access network charging information. ICID is a globally unique 
                    value that may be used to correlate charging records. There may an 
                    IOI generated from each side of the dialog to identify the network 
                    associated with each side. The access network charging information

                         Private SIP Extension for Mobile Charging Information 
                                               April 2002 
                  
                  
                    consists of network specific identifiers for the access level (e.g. 
                    3GPP radio access network or IEEE 802.11b).  
                         
                 2. Discussion of Mechanism  
                         
                    The provided mechanism uses private headers "P-Charging-Function-
                    Addresses" and "P-Charging-Vector" in either the initial request or 
                    subsequent response for a dialog or standalone transaction. 
                     
                    The mechanisms by which an entity determines which values to 
                    populate in the P-Charging-Vector header and "P-Charging-Vector" 
                    are specific to the local implementation and outside the scope of 
                    this document. 
                         
                 3. Applicability Statement  
                         
                    The P-Charging-Function-Addresses and P-Charging-Vector headers are 
                    applicable within a single network where coordination of charging 
                    is required according to the architecture specified in 3GPP TS 
                    32.100 [6]. 
                     
                        
                 4. Syntax  
                         
                    All of the mechanisms specified in this document are described in 
                    both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in RFC 
                    2234 [2]. Further, the BNF definitions from RFC 3261 [1] are 
                    inherited for the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header and are not 
                    repeated here. Implementers need to need to be familiar with the 
                    notation and content of RFC 3261 [2] and RFC 2234 [2] to understand 
                    this document. 
                     
                    The syntax for the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header is: 
                     
                       p-Charging-Function-Addresses =  
                                      "P-Charging-Function-Addresses" HCOLON 1#(

                       primary-ccf = gen-value 
                     
                       secondary-ccf = gen-value 
                     
                       primary-ecf = gen-value 
                     
                       secondary-ecf = gen-value

                    The allowable usage of headers is described in Table 2 of SIP 
                    [1Error! Reference source not found.]. The following additions to 
                    this table are needed for the P-Charging-Vector header.

                    If a proxy that supports this extension receives a request or 
                    response without the P-Charging-Function-Addresses or P-Charging-
                    Vector header, it may insert a P-Charging-Function-Addresses or P-

                    B2BUA  should copy them from the receiving side UA to the sending 
                    side UA.  
                       
                 6. Security Considerations  
                         
                    It is possible for proxies and B2BUAs within a closed network to 
                    modify the value of P-Charging-Function-Addresses and P-Charging-
                    Vector or to insert these headers into a request for a dialog, e.g. 
                    INVITE request (or other request or response).  It is also possible 
                    for proxies on the INVITE path to execute many different attacks.  
                    It is therefore critical to apply transitive mutual authentication 
                    between entities in the closed network, using sips: or other 
                    available mechanisms in order to prevent such attacks.   
                         
                 7. IANA Considerations  
                      
                    This document defines the SIP extension headers "P-Charging-
                    Function-Addresses" and "P-Charging-Vector" which should be 
                    included in the registry of SIP headers defined in SIP [1]. As 
                    required by the SIP change process draft-tsvarea-sipchange [4] the 
                    SIP extension header name "Charging-Function-Addresses" and 
                    "Charging-Vector" should also be registered in association with 
                    this extension.
