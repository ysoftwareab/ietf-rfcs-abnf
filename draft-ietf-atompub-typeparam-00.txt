Abstract

   The Atom Syndication Format (RFC 4287) defines the 'application/
   atom+xml' media type to identify both Atom Feed and Atom Entry
   Documents.  This document defines an optional 'type' parameter used
   to differentiate the two types of Atom documents.

Internet-Draft   The application/atom+xml Type Parameter   December 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287] defines two types of documents
   that can be identified using the 'application/atom+xml' media type.
   Implementation experience has demonstrated, however, that Atom Feed
   and Entry Documents can have different processing models and there
   are situations where they need to be differentiated.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The 'type' parameter

   This document defines a new "type" parameter for use with the
   'application/atom+xml' media type.
   type = "entry" / "feed"

   Neither the parameter name nor its value are case sensitive.

   The value 'entry' indicates that the media type identifies an Atom
   Entry Document.  The root element of the document MUST be atom:entry.

   The value 'feed' indicates that the media type identifies an Atom
   Feed Document.  The root element of the document MUST be atom:feed.

   If not specified, the type is assumed to be unspecified, requiring
   Atom processors to examine the root element to determine the type of
   Atom document.


4.  Conformance

   New specifications MAY require that the type parameter be used to
   identify the Atom Document type.  Producers of Atom Entry Documents
   SHOULD use the type parameter regardless of whether or not it is
   required.  Producers of Atom Feed Documents MAY use the parameter.

   Atom processors that do not recognize the 'type' parameter MUST
   ignore its value and examine the root element to determine the
   document type.

   Atom processors that do recognize the parameter SHOULD detect and
   report inconsistencies between the parameter's value and the actual

   type of the document's root element.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a reference to this specification in the
   'application/atom+xml' media type registration.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in Section 8 of [RFC4287]
   apply.
