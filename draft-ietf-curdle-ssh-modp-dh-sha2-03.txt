Internet-Draft       More MODP DH KEX Groups for SSH          March 2017


1.  Overview and Rationale

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a common protocol for secure communication on
   the Internet.  Due to recent security concerns with SHA-1 [RFC6194]
   and with MODP groups with less than 2048 bits [NIST-SP-800-131Ar1]
   implementer and users request support for larger Diffie Hellman (DH)
   MODP group sizes with data integrity verification using the SHA-2
   family of secure hash algorithms as well as MODP groups providing
   more security.

   The United States Information Assurance Directorate at the National
   Security Agency has published a FAQ [MFQ-U-OO-815099-15] suggesting
   both: a) DH groups using less than 3072-bits, and b) the use of SHA-2
   based hashes less than SHA2-384, are no longer sufficient for
   transport of Top Secret information.  For this reason, the new MODP
   groups are being introduced starting with the MODP 3072-bit group 15
   are all using SHA2-512 as the hash algorithm.

   The DH 2048-bit MODP group 14 is already present in most SSH
   implementations and most implementations already have a SHA2-256
   implementation, so diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 is provided as an
   easy to implement and faster to use key exchange for small embedded
   applications.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Key Exchange Algorithms

   This memo adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in specifying
   how the use of new data key exchange is indicated in SSH.

   The following new key exchange algorithms are defined:

   Key Exchange Method Name
   diffie-hellman-group14-sha256
   diffie-hellman-group15-sha512
   diffie-hellman-group16-sha512
   diffie-hellman-group17-sha512
   diffie-hellman-group18-sha512

Internet-Draft       More MODP DH KEX Groups for SSH          March 2017


   The SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms are defined in
   [FIPS-180-4].

   The method of key exchange used for the name "diffie-hellman-
   group14-sha256" is the same as that for "diffie-hellman-group14-sha1"
   except that the SHA2-256 hash algorithm is used.

   The group15 through group18 names are the same as those specified in
   [RFC3526] 3071-bit MODP Group 15, 4096-bit MODP Group 16, 6144-bit
   MODP Group 17, and 8192-bit MODP Group 18.

   The SHA2-512 algorithm is to be used when "sha512" is specified as a
   part of the key exchange method name.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document augments the Key Exchange Method Names in [RFC4253].

   IANA is requested to add to the Key Exchange Method Names algorithm
   registry with the following entries:

                 Key Exchange Method Name      Reference
                 ----------------------------- ----------
                 diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 This Draft
                 diffie-hellman-group15-sha512 This Draft
                 diffie-hellman-group16-sha512 This Draft
                 diffie-hellman-group17-sha512 This Draft
                 diffie-hellman-group18-sha512 This Draft

   parameters.xhtml#ssh-parameters-16>]

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4253] apply to this document.

   The security considerations of [RFC3526] suggest that these MODP
   groups have security strengths given in this table.  They are based
   on [RFC3766] Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For
   Exchanging Symmetric Keys.
