           IETF Stream Documents Require IETF Rough Consensus
          draft-halpern-gendispatch-consensusinformational-03

Abstract

   This document proposes that the IETF never publish any IETF Stream
   RFCs without IETF rough consensus.  This updates RFC 2026.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

1.  Introduction

   IETF procedures, as defined by [RFC2026] allow for Informational or
   Experimental RFCs to be published without IETF rough consensus.  For
   context, it should be remembered that this RFC predates the
   separation of the various streams (e.g.  IRTF, IAB, and Independent.)
   When it was written, there were only "RFC"s.

   As a consequence, it was permitted for the IESG to approve an
   Internet Draft for publication as an RFC without IETF rough
   consensus.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Action

   The IETF MUST NOT publish RFCs on the IETF Stream without
   establishing IETF rough consensus for publication.

4.  Discussion

   The IETF procedures prior to publication of this BCP permit such
   information or experimental publication without IETF rough consensus.
   In 2007 the IESG issued a statement saying that no document will be
   issued without first conducting an IETF Last Call [IESG-STATE-AD].
   While this apparently improved the situation, looking closely it
   makes it worse.  Rather than publishing documents without verifying
   that there is rough consensus, as the wording in [RFC2026] suggests,
   this has the IESG explicitly publishing documents on the IETF Stream
   that have failed to achieve rough consensus.

Internet-Draft             IETF Doc Consensus              February 2020


   One could argue that there is a need for publishing some documents
   that the community can not agree on.  However, we have an explicit
   procedure for such publication, namely the Independent Stream.  Or,
   for research documents, the IRTF Stream, which explicitly publishes
   many minority opinion Informational RFCs.

   If this proposal is not accepted, there is still a minor problem to
   be addressed.  When a non-consensus document is published, the
   current boilerplate simply omits the sentence claiming that there is
   consensus.  If the community feels that we need to keep the right for
   the IESG to publish Informational or Experimental RFCs without IETF
   rough consensus, then please, the IAB SHOULD use its authorithy over
   the boilerplate for RFCs to make the boilerplate explicit rather than
   relying on readers to detect a missing sentence.

   Editors Note: The above paragraph and this note should be removed
   prior to publication as an RFC, as the paragraph will then be OBE.

5.  IANA Considerations

   No values are assigned in this document, no registries are created,
   and there is no action assigned to the IANA by this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.  It is a
   process document about changes to the rules for certain corner cases
   in publishing IETF Stream RFCs.  However, this procedure will prevent
   publication of IETF stream documents that have not reached rough
   consensus about their security aspects, thus potentially improving
   security aspects of IETF stream documents.
