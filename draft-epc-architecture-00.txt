1.  Introduction

   This memo introduce an Software Defined Networking (SDN) based
   architecture to monitor and analyse physical parameters on various
   types of network equipments, and control the adjustable parts of
   parameters.  SDN is a programmable networks approach that supports
   the separation of control and forwarding plane via standardized
   interfaces, and make equipments foolish while centralizing control
   function on a logical entity named Controller.  The controller can
   achieve rapid and accurate fault location, dynamic parameter
   adjustment, fault prediction via this memo.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Equipment Parameter Controller (EPC): the controller supports
   functions about equipment parameter control.

   Controllable Equipment (CE): the equipment supports external physical
   parameter control by EPC.

   Physical Parameter Collection Module (PPCM): the module to collect
   and consolidate physical parameters from multiple equipments in CE.

   Preprocessing Module (PM): the module to mantain performance
   database, and manage the state of the CE.

   Physical Component Monitor (PCM): the monitor which can monitor one
   or more components at one equipment, and send collected data to
   Preprocessing module.

   Computational Core (CC): the logical core which can provide enough
   computing resource in controller.

   Decision Core (DC): the logical core which can make decision
   according to results calculated by computational core.

   Equipment Parameter Interface (EPI): the interface between EPC and
   CE.

4.  Motivation and Goals

   The tradictional network architecture is based on overlapping
   hierarchical model in order to decouple complex set of network
   functions, and simplify network design, such as seven-layer Open
   System Interconnection (OSI).  Overlapping hierarchical architecture
   makes under-layer transparent to adjacent upper-layer, so cross-layer
   collaboration is difficult.  SDN is able to do that in network level
   via openflow, restconf, and other protocols.  The collaboration of
   network level is about network resource allocation, such as traffic
   grooming in IP-over-WDM network.  However, SDN can't handle events
   happened on equipment-level (foe example, transmission performance
   improvement), because there is no standard to describe equipment
   control in detail currently.  Equipments are basis of network, whose
   running status are important to network management.  Therefore, it's
   necessary to standardize the interfaces about running physical
   parameters between controller and euipments, and the mentioned
   euipments are not limited to router, switch, OTN, WDM, etc., but
   including detailed modules in equipments like Erbium Doped Fiber
   Amplifier (EDFA).  There are three advantages mainly to provide
   euipment parameter control: rapid and accurate fault location,
   dynamic parameter adjustment, and fault prediction.

4.1.  Fault Location

   Fault location is a significant challenge in network operation and
   maintenance.  Currently, fault location is handled by operator, hence
   depends on experience, which is unstable and unsafe.  On the other
   hand, it is rare for an equipment to encounter a failure.  So, there
   is no enough examples for operators to gather experience effectively.

   However, if all fault information could be collected by controller,
   it's possible for controller to dig out relationship between warning
   logs and fault location.

4.2.  Dynamic Parameter Adjustment

   There are many parameters that can reflect equipment transmission
   performance, such as bit error rate, packet loss rate, transmission
   delay, forwarding delay, etc.  All these features are decided by the
   system consisting of power, amplifier, encoder, decoder, and so on.
   Otherwise, other features related to equipment, for example,
   temperature and humidity in machine room, also have important
   influence on equipment performance.  It is very hard for vendor to
   search a formula to describe the relationship between performance and
   state, and different design of equipment also leed to different
   association.

   Based on these, euipment parameter adjustment is a complex problem
   about systems engineering, that requires huge storage resource to
   store performance logs and high computing power to analyse logs to
   seek potential incidence relation.  In SDN architecture, network
   controller is able to use sophisticated analytical models such as
   machine learning, to handle these logs, and calculate proper model to
   adjust equipment parameters.

4.3.  Fault Prediction

   Based on those mentioned above, Controller is able to take advantage
   of high computational resources to optimize those parameters
   automatically.

            Figure 1: Equipment Parameter Control Architecture

   Equipment Parameter Control Architecture is consisting of two parts:
   Controllable Equipment (CE) and Equipment Parameter Controller (EPC).
   CE contains multiple physical component monitor (PCM) to record
   equipment state fluctuation.  All the history and real-time data
   would be gathered on Preprocessing module.  Preprocessing module is a
   micro-core of equipment, which is responsible for data collection,
   data filter, data report, and equipment control according to
   instruction from EPC.

   EPC is consisting of four parts: Physical Parameter Collection Module
   (PPCM), Dataset Core (DC), Computational Core (CC), and Policy Core
   (PC).  PPCM is responsible to build connection with CEs through
   Equipment Parameter Interface (EPI), then read performance data to ,
   and send instructions to control CEs.

   DC, CC, and PC form a closed cycle.  DC is a high-performance storage
   module, which is responsible to save huge data reported from PPCM,
   and preprocess it.  Preprocessing includes data formatting, data
   aggregation, data cleaning, data augmentation, and so on.  CC is a
   compute-intensive module to provide computation power (expecially
   floating-point calculation) for PC.  PC is the brain of EPC, which
   contains an algorithm library about artificial intelligence.  PC also
   contains applications to make decisions to adjust parameters of CEs
   by using dataset of DC and power of CC.

6.  Architectural Considerations of Equipment Parameter Control

6.1.  Distributed EPC

   In a domain or network, the process to massive data that is collected
   from multiple CEs requires high storage resources for efficient
   access, and high computation resources for big data analysis.  So,
   there MAY be a cluster of multiple EPCs that coordinate with each
   other.  A CE MAY be linked to a particular EPC, or MAY be able to
   choose freely among several EPCs in a cluster.
