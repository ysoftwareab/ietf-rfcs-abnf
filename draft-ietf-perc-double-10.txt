                   SRTP Double Encryption Procedures
                       draft-ietf-perc-double-10

Abstract

   In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary
   to be able to manipulate some parameters in Real Time Protocol (RTP)
   packets, while still providing strong end-to-end security guarantees.
   This document defines a cryptographic transform for the Secure Real
   Time Protocol (SRTP) that uses two separate but related cryptographic
   operations to provide hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees.
   Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic algorithms can
   utilize an authenticated encryption with associated data scheme or
   take advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties.

1.  Introduction

   Cloud conferencing systems that are based on switched conferencing
   have a central Media Distributor device that receives media from
   endpoints and distributes it to other endpoints, but does not need to
   interpret or change the media content.  For these systems, it is
   desirable to have one cryptographic key from the sending endpoint to
   the receiving endpoint that can encrypt and authenticate the media
   end-to-end while still allowing certain information in the header of
   a Real Time Protocol (RTP) packet to be changed by the Media
   Distributor.  At the same time, a separate cryptographic key provides
   integrity and optional confidentiality for the media flowing between

   the Media Distributor and the endpoints.  The framework document
   [I-D.ietf-perc-private-media-framework] describes this concept in
   more detail.

   This specification defines a transform for the Secure Real Time
   Protocol (SRTP) that uses the AES-GCM algorithm [RFC7714] to provide
   encryption and integrity for an RTP packet for the end-to-end
   cryptographic key as well as a hop-by-hop cryptographic encryption
   and integrity between the endpoint and the Media Distributor.  The
   Media Distributor decrypts and checks integrity of the hop-by-hop
   security.  The Media Distributor MAY change some of the RTP header
   information that would impact the end-to-end integrity.  In that
   case, the original value of any RTP header field that is changed is
   included in a new RTP header extension called the Original Header
   Block.  The new RTP packet is encrypted with the hop-by-hop
   cryptographic algorithm before it is sent.  The receiving endpoint
   decrypts and checks integrity using the hop-by-hop cryptographic
   algorithm and then replaces any parameters the Media Distributor
   changed using the information in the Original Header Block before
   decrypting and checking the end-to-end integrity.

   One can think of the double as a normal SRTP transform for encrypting
   the RTP in a way where things that only know half of the key, can
   decrypt and modify part of the RTP packet but not other parts,
   including the media payload.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Terms used throughout this document include:

   o  Media Distributor: A device that receives media from endpoints and
      distributes it to other endpoints, but does not need to interpret
      or change the media content (see also
      [I-D.ietf-perc-private-media-framework])

   o  end-to-end: The path from one endpoint through one or more Media
      Distributors to the endpoint at the other end.

   o  hop-by-hop: The path from the endpoint to or from the Media
      Distributor.

Internet-Draft                 Double SRTP                  October 2018


   o  Original Header Block (OHB): An octet string that contains the
      original values from the RTP header that might have been changed
      by a Media Distributor.

3.  Cryptographic Context

   This specification uses a cryptographic context with two parts:

   o  An inner (end-to-end) part that is used by endpoints that
      originate and consume media to ensure the integrity of media end-
      to-end, and

   o  An outer (hop-by-hop) part that is used between endpoints and
      Media Distributors to ensure the integrity of media over a single
      hop and to enable a Media Distributor to modify certain RTP header
      fields.  RTCP is also handled using the hop-by-hop cryptographic
      part.

   The RECOMMENDED cipher for the hop-by-hop and end-to-end algorithm is
   AES-GCM.  Other combinations of SRTP ciphers that support the
   procedures in this document can be added to the IANA registry.

   The keys and salt for these algorithms are generated with the
   following steps:

   o  Generate key and salt values of the length required for the
      combined inner (end-to-end) and outer (hop-by-hop) algorithms.

   o  Assign the key and salt values generated for the inner (end-to-
      end) algorithm to the first half of the key and the first half of
      the salt for the double algorithm.

   o  Assign the key and salt values for the outer (hop-by-hop)
      algorithm to the second half of the key and second half of the
      salt for the double algorithm.  The first half of the key is
      referred to as the inner key while the second half is referred to
      as the outer key.  When a key is used by a cryptographic
      algorithm, the salt used is the part of the salt generated with
      that key.

   o  the SSRC is the same for both the inner and out outer algorithms
      as it can not be changed.

   o  The SEQ and ROC are tracked independently for the inner and outer
      algorithms.

   If the Media Distributor is to be able to modify header fields but
   not decrypt the payload, then it must have cryptographic key for the

   outer algorithm, but not the inner (end-to-end) algorithm.  This
   document does not define how the Media Distributor should be
   provisioned with this information.  One possible way to provide
   keying material for the outer (hop-by-hop) algorithm is to use
   [I-D.ietf-perc-dtls-tunnel].

3.1.  Key Derivation

   In order to allow the inner and outer keys to be managed
   independently via the master key, the transforms defined in this
   document MUST be used with the following pseudo-random function
   (PRF), which preserves the separation between the two halves of the
   key.  Given a positive integer "n" representing the desired output
   length, a master key "k_master", and an input "x":

         PRF_double_n(k_master,x) = PRF_inner_(n/2)(k_master,x) ||
                                    PRF_outer_(n/2)(k_master,x)

         PRF_inner_n(k_master,x)  = PRF_n(inner(k_master),x)
         PRF_outer_n(k_master,x)  = PRF_n(outer(k_master),x)

   Here "PRF_n(k, x)" represents the AES_CM PRF KDF [RFC3711] for
   DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_128_GCM_AEAD_AES_128_GCM algorithm and AES_256_CM_PRF
   KDF [RFC6188] for DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_256_GCM_AEAD_AES_256_GCM algorithm.
   "inner(key)" represents the first half of the key, and "outer(key)"
   represents the second half of the key.

4.  Original Header Block

   The Original Header Block (OHB) contains the original values of any
   modified RTP header fields.  In the encryption process, the OHB is
   appended to the RTP payload.  In the decryption process, the
   receiving endpoint uses it to reconstruct the original RTP header, so
   that it can pass the proper AAD value to the inner transform.

   The OHB can reflect modifications to the following fields in an RTP
   header: the payload type, the sequence number, and the marker bit.
   All other fields in the RTP header MUST remain unmodified; since the
   OHB cannot reflect their original values, the receiver will be unable
   to verify the E2E integrity of the packet.

   The OHB has the following syntax (in ABNF [RFC5234]):

Internet-Draft                 Double SRTP                  October 2018


   OCTET = %x00-FF

   PT = OCTET
   SEQ = 2OCTET
   Config = OCTET
   OHB = [ PT ] [ SEQ ] Config


   If present, the PT and SEQ parts of the OHB contain the original
   payload type and sequence number fields, respectively.  The final
   "config" octet of the OHB specifies whether these fields are present,
   and the original value of the marker bit (if necessary):

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |R R R R B M P Q|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  P: PT is present

   o  Q: SEQ is present

   o  M: Marker bit is present

   o  B: Value of marker bit

   o  R: Reserved, MUST be set to 0

   In particular, an all-zero OHB config octet (0x00) indicates that
   there have been no modifications from the original header.

5.  RTP Operations

   As implied by the use of the word "double" above, this transform
   applies AES-GCM to the SRTP packet twice.  This allows media
   distributors to be able to modify some header fields while allowing
   endpoints to verify the end-to-end integrity and confidentiality of a
   packet.

   The first, "inner" application of AES-GCM encrypts the SRTP payload
   and integrity-protects a version of the SRTP header with extensions
   truncated.  Omitting extensions from the inner integrity check means
   that they can be modified by a media distributor holding only the
   "outer" key.

   The second, "outer" application of AES-GCM encrypts the ciphertext
   produced by the inner encryption (i.e., the encrypted payload and
   authentication tag), plus an OHB that expresses any changes made
   between the inner and outer transforms.

   A media distributor that has the outer key but not the inner key may
   modify the header fields that can be included in the OHB by
   decrypting, modifying, and re-encrypting the packet.

5.1.  Encrypting a Packet

   To encrypt a packet, the endpoint encrypts the packet using the inner
   (end-to-end) cryptographic key and then encrypts using the outer
   (hop-by-hop) cryptographic key.  The encryption also supports a mode
   for repair packets that only does the outer (hop-by-hop) encryption.
   The processes is as follows:

   1.  Form an RTP packet.  If there are any header extensions, they
       MUST use [RFC8285].

   2.  If the packet is for repair mode data, skip to step 6.

   3.  Form a synthetic RTP packet with the following contents:

       *  Header: The RTP header of the original packet with the
          following modifications:

       *  The X bit is set to zero

       *  The header is truncated to remove any extensions (i.e., keep
          only the first 12 + 4 * CC bytes of the header)

       *  Payload: The RTP payload of the original packet

   4.  Apply the inner cryptographic algorithm to the synthetic RTP
       packet from the previous step.

   5.  Replace the header of the protected RTP packet with the header of
       the original packet, and append an empty OHB (0x00) to the
       encrypted payload (with the authentication tag) obtained from the
       step 4.

   6.  Apply the outer cryptographic algorithm to the RTP packet.  If
       encrypting RTP header extensions hop-by-hop, then [RFC6904] MUST
       be used when encrypting the RTP packet using the outer
       cryptographic key.

   When using EKT [I-D.ietf-perc-srtp-ekt-diet], the EKT Field comes
   after the SRTP packet exactly like using EKT with any other SRTP
   transform.

Internet-Draft                 Double SRTP                  October 2018


5.2.  Relaying a Packet

   The Media Distributor has the part of the key for the outer (hop-by-
   hop) cryptographic algorithm, but it does not have the part of the
   key for the (end-to-end) cryptographic algorithm.  The cryptographic
   algorithm and key used to decrypt a packet and any encrypted RTP
   header extensions would be the same as those used in the endpoint's
   outer algorithm and key.

   In order to modify a packet, the Media Distributor decrypts the
   received packet, modifies the packet, updates the OHB with any
   modifications not already present in the OHB, and re-encrypts the
   packet using the the outer (hop-by-hop) cryptographic key before
   transmitting.

   1.  Apply the outer (hop-by-hop) cryptographic algorithm to decrypt
       the packet.  If decrypting RTP header extensions hop-by-hop, then
       [RFC6904] MUST be used.  Note that the RTP payload produced by
       this decryption operation contains the original encrypted payload
       with the tag from the inner transform and the OHB appended.

   2.  Make any desired changes to the fields are allowed to be changed,
       i.e., PT, SEQ, and M.

   3.  A Media Distributor can add information to the OHB, but MUST NOT
       change existing information in the OHB.  If RTP value is changed
       and not already in the OHB, then add it with its original value
       to the OHB.

   4.  If the Media Distributor resets a parameter to its original
       value, it MAY drop it from the OHB.  Note that this might result
       in a decrease in the size of the OHB.

   5.  Apply the outer (hop-by-hop) cryptographic algorithm to the
       packet.  If the RTP Sequence Number has been modified, SRTP
       processing happens as defined in SRTP and will end up using the
       new Sequence Number.  If encrypting RTP header extensions hop-by-
       hop, then [RFC6904] MUST be used.

   In order to avoid nonce reuse, the cryptographic contexts used in
   step 1 and step 5 MUST use different, independent master keys and
   master salts.

   Note that if multiple MDs modify the same packet, then the first MD
   to alter a given header field is the one that adds it to the OHB.  If
   a subsequent MD changes the value of a header field that has already
   been changed, then the original value will already be in the OHB, so
   no update to the OHB is required.

Internet-Draft                 Double SRTP                  October 2018


   A Media Distributor that decrypts, modifies, and re-encrypts packets
   in this way MUST use an independent key for each recipient, SHOULD
   use an independent salt for each recipient, and MUST NOT re-encrypt
   the packet using the sender's keys.  If the Media Distributor
   decrypts and re-encrypts with the same key and salt, it will result
   in the reuse of a (key, nonce) pair, undermining the security of GCM.

5.3.  Decrypting a Packet

   To decrypt a packet, the endpoint first decrypts and verifies using
   the outer (hop-by-hop) cryptographic key, then uses the OHB to
   reconstruct the original packet, which it decrypts and verifies with
   the inner (end-to-end) cryptographic key.

   1.  Apply the outer cryptographic algorithm to the packet.  If the
       integrity check does not pass, discard the packet.  The result of
       this is referred to as the outer SRTP packet.  If decrypting RTP
       header extensions hop-by-hop, then [RFC6904] MUST be used when
       decrypting the RTP packet using the outer cryptographic key.

   2.  If the packet is for repair mode data, skip the rest of the
       steps.  Note that the packet that results from the repair
       algorithm will still have encrypted data that needs to be
       decrypted as specified by the repair algorithm sections.

   3.  Remove the inner authentication tag and the OHB from the end of
       the payload of the outer SRTP packet.

   4.  Form a new synthetic SRTP packet with:

       *  Header = Received header, with the following modifications:

       *  Header fields replaced with values from OHB (if any)

       *  The X bit is set to zero

       *  The header is truncated to remove any extensions (i.e., keep
          only the first 12 + 4 * CC bytes of the header)

       *  Payload is the encrypted payload from the outer SRTP packet
          (after the inner tag and OHB have been stripped).

       *  Authentication tag is the inner authentication tag from the
          outer SRTP packet.

   5.  Apply the inner cryptographic algorithm to this synthetic SRTP
       packet.  Note if the RTP Sequence Number was changed by the Media
       Distributor, the synthetic packet has the original Sequence



Jennings, et al.         Expires April 20, 2019                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                 Double SRTP                  October 2018


       Number.  If the integrity check does not pass, discard the
       packet.

   Once the packet has been successfully decrypted, the application
   needs to be careful about which information it uses to get the
   correct behavior.  The application MUST use only the information
   found in the synthetic SRTP packet and MUST NOT use the other data
   that was in the outer SRTP packet with the following exceptions:

   o  The PT from the outer SRTP packet is used for normal matching to
      SDP and codec selection.

   o  The sequence number from the outer SRTP packet is used for normal
      RTP ordering.

   The PT and sequence number from the inner SRTP packet can be used for
   collection of various statistics.

   If the RTP header of the outer packet contains extensions, they MAY
   be used.  However, because extensions are not protected end-to-end,
   implementations SHOULD reject an RTP packet containing headers that
   would require end-to-end protection.

6.  RTCP Operations

   Unlike RTP, which is encrypted both hop-by-hop and end-to-end using
   two separate cryptographic keys, RTCP is encrypted using only the
   outer (hop-by-hop) cryptographic key.  The procedures for RTCP
   encryption are specified in [RFC3711] and this document introduces no
   additional steps.

7.  Use with Other RTP Mechanisms

   Media distributors sometimes interact with RTP media packets sent by
   endpoints, e.g., to provide recovery or receive commands via DTMF.
   When media packets are encrypted end-to-end, these procedures require
   modification.

   Repair mechanisms, in general, will need to perform recovery on
   encrypted packets (double-encrypted when using this transform).  When
   the recovery mechanism calls for the recovery packet itself to be
   encrypted, it is encrypted with only the outer, HBH key.  This allows
   a media distributor to generate recovery packets without having
   access to the inner, E2E keys.  However, it also results in recovery
   packets being triple-encrypted, twice for the base transform, and
   once for the recovery protection.

7.1.  RTP Retransmission (RTX)

   When using RTX [RFC4588] with double, the cached payloads MUST be the
   double-encrypted packets, i.e., the bits that are sent over the wire
   to the other side.  When encrypting a retransmission packet, it MUST
   be encrypted the packet in repair mode (i.e., with only the HBH key).

   A typical RTX receiver would decrypt the packet, undo the RTX
   transformation, then process the resulting packet normally by using
   the steps in Section 5.3.

7.2.  Redundant Audio Data (RED)

   When using RED [RFC2198] with double, the primary encoding MAY
   contain RTP header extensions and CSRC identifiers but non primary
   encodings cannot.

   The sender takes encrypted payload from the cached packets to form
   the RED payload.  Any header extensions from the primary encoding are
   copied to the RTP packet that will carry the RED payload and the
   other RTP header information such as SSRC, SEQ, CSRC, etc are set to
   the same as the primary payload.  The RED RTP packet is then
   encrypted in repair mode and sent.

   The receiver decrypts the payload to find the encrypted RED payload.
   Note a media relay can do this decryption as the packet was sent in
   repair mode that only needs the hop-by-hop key.  The RTP headers and
   header extensions along with the primary payload and PT from inside
   the RED payload (for the primary encoding) are used to form the
   encrypted primary RTP packet which can then be decrypted with double.

   The RTP headers (but not header extensions or CSRC) along with PT
   from inside the RED payload corresponding to the redundant encoding
   are used to from the non primary payloads.  The time offset and
   packet rate information in the RED data MUST be used to adjust the
   sequence number in the RTP header.  At this point the non primary
   packets can be decrypted with double.

   Note that Flex FEC [I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme] is a
   superset of the capabilities of RED.  For most applications, FlexFEC
   is a better choice than RED.

7.3.  Forward Error Correction (FEC)

   When using Flex FEC [I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme] with
   double, repair packets MUST be constructed by first double-encrypting
   the packet, then performing FEC.  Processing of repair packets
   proceeds in the opposite order, performing FEC recovery and then

Internet-Draft                 Double SRTP                  October 2018


   decrypting.  This ensures that the original media is not revealed to
   the Media Distributor but at the same time allows the Media
   Distributor to repair media.  When encrypting a packet that contains
   the Flex FEC data, which is already encrypted, it MUST be encrypted
   with only the outer, HBH transform.

   The algorithm recommended in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-fec] for repair of
   video is Flex FEC [I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme].  Note that
   for interoperability with WebRTC, [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-fec] recommends
   not using additional FEC only m-line in SDP for the repair packets.

7.4.  DTMF

   When DTMF is sent using the mechanism in [RFC4733], it is end-to-end
   encrypted and the relay can not read it, so it cannot be used to
   control the relay.  Other out of band methods to control the relay
   need to be used instead.

8.  Recommended Inner and Outer Cryptographic Algorithms

   This specification recommends and defines AES-GCM as both the inner
   and outer cryptographic algorithms, identified as
   DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_128_GCM_AEAD_AES_128_GCM and
   DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_256_GCM_AEAD_AES_256_GCM.  These algorithm provide
   for authenticated encryption and will consume additional processing
   time double-encrypting for hop-by-hop and end-to-end.  However, the
   approach is secure and simple, and is thus viewed as an acceptable
   trade-off in processing efficiency.

   Note that names for the cryptographic transforms are of the form
   DOUBLE_(inner algorithm)_(outer algorithm).

   While this document only defines a profile based on AES-GCM, it is
   possible for future documents to define further profiles with
   different inner and outer algorithms in this same framework.  For
   example, if a new SRTP transform was defined that encrypts some or
   all of the RTP header, it would be reasonable for systems to have the
   option of using that for the outer algorithm.  Similarly, if a new
   transform was defined that provided only integrity, that would also
   be reasonable to use for the outer transform as the payload data is
   already encrypted by the inner transform.

   The AES-GCM cryptographic algorithm introduces an additional 16
   octets to the length of the packet.  When using AES-GCM for both the
   inner and outer cryptographic algorithms, the total additional length
   is 32 octets.  If no other header extensions are present in the
   packet and the OHB is introduced, that will consume an additional 8
   octets.  If other extensions are already present, the OHB will

Internet-Draft                 Double SRTP                  October 2018


   consume up to 4 additional octets.  Packets in repair mode will carry
   additional repair data, further increasing their size.

9.  Security Considerations

   This SRTP transform provides protection against two classes of
   attacker: An network attacker that knows neither the inner nor outer
   keys, and a malicious MD that knows the outer key.  Obviously, it
   provides no protections against an attacker that holds both the inner
   and outer keys.

   The protections with regard to the network are the same as with the
   normal SRTP AES-GCM transforms.

   With regard to a malicious MD, the recipient can verify the integrity
   of the base header fields and confidentiality and integrity of the
   payload.  The recipient has no assurance, however, of the integrity
   of the header extensions in the packet.

   The main innovation of this transform relative to other SRTP
   transforms is that it allows a partly-trusted MD to decrypt, modify,
   and re-encrypt a packet.  When this is done, the cryptographic
   contexts used for decryption and re-encryption MUST use different,
   independent master keys and master salts.  If the same context is
   used, the nonce formation rules for SRTP will cause the same key and
   nonce to be used with two different plaintexts, which substantially
   degrades the security of AES-GCM.

   In other words, from the perspective of the MD, re-encrypting packets
   using this protocol will involve the same cryptographic operations as
   if it had established independent AES-GCM crypto contexts with the
   sender and the receiver.  If the MD doesn't modify any header fields,
   then an MD that supports AES-GCM could be unused unmodified.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  DTLS-SRTP

   We request IANA to add the following values to defines a DTLS-SRTP
   "SRTP Protection Profile" defined in [RFC5764].
