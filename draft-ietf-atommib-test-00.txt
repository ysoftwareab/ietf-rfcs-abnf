          2.  Introduction

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
          describes objects used for managing ATM-based interfaces,
          devices, networks and services in addition to those defined in
          the ATM MIB [1], to provide additional support for the
          management of ATM Loopback Tests.


          3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

          The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
          components.  They are:

          0    RFC 1442 [2] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
               for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.

          0    STD 17, RFC 1213 [3] defines MIB-II, the core set of
               managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

          0    RFC 1445 [4] which defines the administrative and other
               architectural aspects of the framework.

          0    RFC 1448 [5] which defines the protocol used for network
               access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Object Definitions

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
          type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively
          assigned name.  The object type together with an object
          instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
          of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
          string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object
          type.


          5.  Overview

          The purpose of this memo is to provide additional
          capabilities, not found in the ATM MIB [1], which are needed
          to manage ATM interfaces.  This memo addresses ATM Testing
          Support.


          5.1.  Background

          In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB
          modules are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and
          cross-connects.  Examples include MIB II for general system
          and interface management (RFC 1213 and RFC 1573), the DS3 or
          SONET MIBs for management of SONET and DS3 physical
          interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for applications
          that make use of ATM, such as SMDS and LAN Emulation.  These
          MIB modules are outside the scope of this specification.

          This MIB module also requires the use of the ATM MIB module
          defined in [1].

          This memo proposes extensions to the ATM MIB in order to
          support ATM Loopback Tests. An ATM Loopback Test provides the
          ability to send out a loopback OAM (Operations and
          Maintenance) cell to verify the exisitence of connectivity for
          a particular connection.

          The current specification of this supplemental ATM MIB is
          based on SNMPv2 SMI.

          5.3.  Supported Functions

          The managed ATM objects are arranged into the following
          groups:

          I. ATM Testing Support:
                (1) ATM Loopback Testing Group
                (2) ATM End-Point Group.


          5.3.1.  ATM Testing Support

          5.3.1.1.  ATM Loopback Testing Group

          The loopback test provides the ability to send out a loopback
          OAM cell to verify the existence of connectivity for a
          particular connection.  Loopback tests can be performed on
          either an entire connection (i.e., an end-to-end test), a
          segment of the connection (i.e., a segment test), a portion of
          a segment (i.e., a loopback location identifier test), or the
          network portion of a connection (i.e., a service internal
          test).

          draft                  ATM Test Objects           January 1996


          The loopback test makes use of the Interface Test Table
          defined in RFC 1573.  For a given interface, a loopback test
          can be invoked by obtaining ownership of a test and then by
          setting the value of 'ifTestType' equal to one of the ATM
          Loopback Test Types defined in Section (8). See procedures in
          RFC 1573 for using the Interface Test Table.  After invoking a
          loopback test, the object 'ifTestResult' can be read to
          determine the outcome of the loopback test (e.g., success(2)
          if the loopback cell made it back to the originator of the
          test or failed(7) if the loopback cell did not make it back).

          This group contains the following types of loopback tests:

               - End-to-end Loopback Test
               - Segment Loopback Test
               - Loopback Test Using Loopback Location Identifier
               - Network Loopback Test.


          1) End-to-end Loopback Test

          The end-to-end loopback (LB) is self-explanatory.  For a VP
          test, the cell is sent on the given VP, via VCI=4 specified in
          [8].  For a VC test, the LB cell is sent on the VC under test,
          with the PTI (Payload Type Indicator) set to 5 as specified in
          [8].  Figure 3 illustrates the end-to-end loopback test.

          2) Segment Loopback Test

          draft                  ATM Test Objects           January 1996


          The segment LB test is explained in ITU-T I.610[9]. For a VP
          segment test, the LB cell is sent on the VP under test via
          VCI=3 as specified in [8], and the Loopback Location ID field
          is set to all 1's.  For a VC segment test, the LB cell is sent
          on the VC under test, with the PTI set to 4 as specified in
          [8], and the Loopback Location ID field is set to all 1's.

          This test involves a LB cell being inserted at a pre-defined
          segment end-point, and looped back at the corresponding
          segment end-point encountered.  The pair of segment end-points
          define a segment (which is used for the segment loopback
          test).  A VP/VC connection can have multiple segments, but
          multiple segments cannot overlap.

          A UNI interface is by definition defined as a segment end-
          point (hence a UNI would be considered a segment).  A segment
          can also define:
               - a B-ICI
               - a public carrier's 'piece' of the connection
               - a private network's 'piece' of the connection.


          In order to support this functionality, the VP/VC link
          termination needs to be able to be defined as a segment.  This
          can be done using either the atmVplSegmentEndPoint or
          atmVclSegmentEndPoint object depending on whether it is for a
          VPC or VCC.  A segment loopback test is illustrated in Figure
          4.

          This loopback test is a special type of 2) where the Loopback
          Location ID field is set to a value that corresponds to a
          specific node in a given network (Note that the format of this
          field is not standardized, that is, the value is significant
          only within an administrative domain).  In this case, the
          device initiating the LB test inserts the appropriate Loop
          Back Location ID.  When the LB cell reaches the corresponding
          device, that device recognizes the Loopback Location ID as its
          own, and loops it back.  This test is useful for performing
          fault sectionalization without having to provision segment
          end-points.  An additional object, the loopbackLocationID, is
          defined to determine the loopback point.  Figure 5 shows a
          loopback test using a location identifier. Note that the
          loopback test using location identifier can be used to perform
          a loopback test over a portion of a defined segment.  See
          Figure 5.

          See Section (8) for more details.


          4) Network Loopback Test

          This is a loopback test that the manager requests an agent in
          a network to perform over the internal portion of a designated
          connection.  The Network then initiates the internal network
          loopback test by inserting an OAM loopback cell at one of the
          end-points of the internal network portion of the connection.
          When the loopback cell reaches the other end-point of the
          internal Network , the cell is looped back.  This test is
          useful for verifying connectivity through a particular
          network.  Figure 6 illustrates the Network loopback test.

          5.3.1.2.  ATM End-Point Group

          The ATM End-Point Group contains two tables: the ATM VP End-
          point Table and the ATM VC End-point Table. The ATM VP End-
          point Table augments the atmVplTable and provides the
          atmVplEndptSegmentEndPoint object to represent whether or not
          a specified VPL is a segment end-point. Similarly for Virtual
          Channels, the ATM VC End-point Table and the
          atmVclEndptSegmentEndPoint object are used to represent
          whether or not a specified VCL is a segment end-point.

                   at a host) via VCI=4 (the VCI value for VP OAM end-
                   to-end cells), travels to the other end-point of the
                   VP connection, and then loops back to the originating
                   end-point on the designated VP.  Success is achieved
                   if the loopback OAM cell returns to the originating
                   end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise, the test
                   fails.

                   The manager-station can perform a loopback test by
                   making use of the Interface Test Table (ifTestTable)
                   defined in RFC 1573.  In order to run this test the
                   object type 'ifTestType' in the ifTestTable shall be
                   set to (atmLoopbackVpE2e.p) , where the subidentifier
                   'p' is the instance of the atmVplVpi corresponding to
                   the VP designated for the test.

                   Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
                   obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable
                   for the interface to be tested (follow procedure
                   defined in RFC 1573).  Once the manager-station
                   obtains ownership, a loopback test for a given
                   interface can be invoked by first setting up
                   parameters necessary for the loopback test (e.g.,
                   p=1), and then setting the value of 'ifTestType' in
                   the ifTestTable equal to 'atmLoopbackVpE2e'.  This
                   will cause the atmLoopbackVpE2e test to be invoked on
                   the VP with VPI=1.

                   After invoking a loopback test, wait for the test
                   completion by polling for the object 'ifTestResult'.
                   A value of 'inProgress(3)' will result if the test is
                   still in progress.  Once the test is completed, the
                   object 'ifTestResult' will have a value of
                   'success(2)' if the loopback OAM cell returned to the
                   originator of the test within 5 seconds, if not, a
                   value of 'failed(7)' will result.  If the ATM system
                   does not support this type of loopback test, then a
                   value of 'notSupported(4)' will be provided.  Other
                   possible values for the 'ifTestResult' object are

                 "This is a loopback test performed on a designated
                 segment of a VP (Virtual Path).  To perform this test a
                 segment OAM cell is inserted at one of the segment

                 host) via VCI=3 (the VCI used for VP OAM segment
                 cells), travels across the segment on the designated VP
                 to the device pre-configured as the corresponding
                 segment end-point, and then loops back to the
                 originating segment end-point on the designated VP.
                 Success is achieved if the loopback OAM cell returns to
                 the originating end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise,
                 the test fails.  In order to use the
                 atmLoopbackVpSegment test, a segment must be defined by
                 setting up segment end-points using the

                 atmVplEndptTable.  The atmVplEndptSegmentEndPoint is
                 set to isaVpSegmentEndPoint(1) for each segment end-
                 point.  Note that this object is by default set to
                 isaVpSegmentEndPoint(1) if the atmVplTable supports one
                 end of a UNI.  In such a case, a UNI VP loopback test
                 would be achieved when the atmLoopbackVpSegment test
                 was initiated over the UNI.

                 making use of the Interface Test Table (ifTestTable)

                 "This is a loopback test performed on a designated
                 segment of a VC (Virtual Channel).  To perform this
                 test a segment OAM cell is inserted at one of the
                 segment end-points of the designated VC connection
                 (e.g., at a host) via PTI=4 (the PTI value used for VC
                 OAM segment cells), travels across the segment on the
                 designated VC to the device pre-configured as the
                 corresponding segment end-point, and then loops back to
                 the originating segment end-point on the designated VC.
                 Success is achieved if the loopback OAM cell returns to
                 the originating end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise,

                 would be achieved when the atmLoopbackVcSegment test
                 was initiated over the UNI.

                 The manager-station can perform a loopback test by
                 making use of the Interface Test Table (ifTestTable)
                 defined in RFC 1573.  In order to run this test the
                 object type 'ifTestType' in the ifTestTable shall be
                 set to (atmLoopbackVcSegment.p.c) , where the
                 subidentifier 'p' is the instance of the atmVclVpi
                 corresponding to the VP designated for the test and the
                 subidentifier 'c' is the instance of the atmVclVci
                 corresponding to the VC designated for the test.

                 Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
                 obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for
                 the interface to be tested (follow procedure defined in
                 RFC 1573).  Once the manager-station obtains ownership,
                 a loopback test for a given interface can be invoked by
                 first setting up parameters necessary for the loopback
                 test (e.g., p=1, c=33), and then setting the value of
                 'ifTestType' in the ifTestTable equal to
                 'atmLoopbackVcSegment'.  This will cause the
                 atmLoopbackVcSegment test to be invoked on the VC with
                 VPI=1 and VCI=33.

                 After invoking a loopback test, wait for the test
                 completion by polling for the object 'ifTestResult'.  A
                 value of 'inProgress(3)' will result if the test is
                 still in progress.  Once the test is completed, the
                 object 'ifTestResult' will have a value of 'success(2)'
                 if the loopback OAM cell returned to the originator of
                 the test within 5 seconds, if not, a value of

                 values for the 'ifTestResult' object are
                 'unAbleToRun(5)' and 'aborted(6)'."

                 this internal test.  This test may be useful in proxy
                 situations where the proxy agent represents a network.
                 Implementations of this test may be specific to the
                 managed resource.  One implemenation in a managed
                 network may be as follows, the managed network inserts
                 a segment loopback OAM cell at the network internal
                 segment end-point (corresponding to the ingress
                 connection point) for the designated VC connection.
                 The loopback cell then travels through the network's
                 portion of the VC connection until it reaches the
                 networks connection point to the egress, where it is
                 looped back to the network's cell insertion point on
                 the designated VC.  Success is achieved if the loopback
                 OAM cell returns to the originating internal network
                 segment end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise, the test
                 fails.

                 The manager-station can perform a loopback test by
                 making use of the Interface Test Table (ifTestTable)
                 defined in RFC 1573.  In order to run this test the
                 object type 'ifTestType' in the ifTestTable shall be
                 set to (atmLoopbackVcServcInternal.pi.ci.ie.pe.ce) ,
                 where the subidentifier 'pi' is the instance of the
                 atmVclVpi for the ingress corresponding to the VC
                 designated for the test, the subidentifier 'ci' is the
                 instance of the atmVclVci for the ingress corresponding
                 to the VC designated for the test, the subidentifier
                 'ie' is the instance of the ifIndex for the egress
                 corresponding to the VC designated for the test, 'pe'
                 is the instance of the atmVclVpi corresponding to the
                 egress for the VC designated for this test, and 'ce' is
                 the instance of the atmVclVci corresponding to the
                 egress for the VC designated for this test.

                 Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
                 obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for
                 the interface to be tested (follow procedure defined in
                 RFC 1573).  Once the manager-station obtains ownership,
                 a request is sent to the network to initiate the

                 network loopback test on the ingress interface
                 (ifIndex=2) along with the necessary parameters (e.g.,
                 pi=1, ci=33, ie=4, pe=2, ce=41), and then setting the
                 value of 'ifTestType.2' in the ifTestTable equal to
                 'atmLoopbackVcServcInternal'.  This will cause the
                 atmLoopbackVcServcInternal test to be invoked on the
                 network's internal section of the VC between the
                 ingress interface (ifIndex=2) with VPI=1/VCI=33 and the
                 egress interface with ifIndex=4 and VPI=2/VCI=41.

                 After invoking a loopback test, wait for the test
                 completion by polling for the object 'ifTestResult'.  A
                 value of 'inProgress(3)' will result if the test is
                 still in progress.  Once the test is completed, the
                 object 'ifTestResult' will have a value of 'success(2)'
                 if the loopback OAM cell returned to the originator of
                 the test within 5 seconds, if not, a value of
                 'failed(7)' will result.  If the ATM system does not
                 support this type of loopback test, then a value of
                 'notSupported(4)' will be provided.  Other possible
                 values for the 'ifTestResult' object are
                 'unAbleToRun(5)' and 'aborted(6)'."
