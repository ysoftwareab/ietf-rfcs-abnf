1.  Introduction

   The XML Enabled Directory (XED) framework leverages existing
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] and X.500
   directory [X.500] technology to create a directory service that
   stores, manages and transmits Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   [XML10][XML11] format data, while maintaining interoperability with
   LDAP clients, X.500 Directory User Agents (DUAs), and X.500 Directory
   System Agents (DSAs).  This document introduces the various XED
   specifications.

   The main features of XED are:

    - semantically equivalent XML renditions of existing directory
      protocols,

    - XML renditions of directory data,

    - the ability to accept at run time, user-defined attribute syntaxes
      specified in a variety of XML schema languages,

    - the ability to perform filter matching on the parts of XML format
      attribute values,

    - the flexibility for implementors to develop XED clients using only
      their favoured XML schema language.

   Section 3 describes how existing directory constructs are mapped into
   XML.

   Section 4 describes how separately developed XML schema

   specifications can be incorporated into directory specifications.

   Section 5 discusses how user-defined attribute syntaxes can be
   imported into directory schema.

   The XML renditions of existing directory protocols are described in
   Section 6.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and  "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [BCP14].

3.  Leveraging Existing Specifications

   X.500 is defined in terms of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   [X.680].  LDAP is defined in part in ASN.1 and in part with ad-hoc
   syntax definitions, though for the most part the ad-hoc definitions
   have an underlying ASN.1 definition through association with X.500.
   The XED framework enables data conforming to existing directory data
   types in ASN.1 to have an XML representation by defining a set of
   ASN.1 encoding rules, the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER) [RXER]
   [RXEREI].  This representation can be accessed in LDAP through a
   transfer encoding option [TRANSFER].  Directory data are otherwise
   accessed in their XML representation through one of the XED protocols
   (Section 6).

4.  Incorporating XML Specifications

   The XED framework does not aim for a complete specification of the
   directory in one schema language (e.g., by translating everything
   that isn't ASN.1 into ASN.1, or by translating everything that isn't
   XML Schema [XSD0] into XML Schema), but rather seeks to integrate
   specifications in differing schema definition languages into a
   cohesive whole.

   The motivation for this approach is the observation that although
   XML Schema [XSD0], RELAX NG [RNG] and ASN.1 are broadly similar, they
   each have unique features that cannot be adequately expressed in the
   other languages.  Thus a guiding principle for XED is the assertion
   that the best schema language in which to represent a data type is
   the language of its original specification.  Consequently, a need
   arises for the means to reference definitions not only in different
   documents, but specified in different schema languages.

   The XED framework defines mechanisms [RXEREI] by which ASN.1



Legg & Prager              Expires 1 June 2006                  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT          The XML Enabled Directory       December 1, 2005


   specifications may directly reference XML Schema definitions,
   RELAX NG definitions and document type definitions (DTDs)
   [XML10][XML11].  This capability is a prerequisite for importing
   user-defined non-ASN.1 data types into directory schemas.  The
   framework also defines how qualified names [XMLNS10][XMLNS11] are
   assigned to ASN.1 definitions [ASN.X] so that XML Schema and RELAX NG
   documents can reference ASN.1 definitions.

   Multi-schema validators conforming to the XED framework will of
   course understand and apply references across schema languages.
   However, in order to accommodate non-ASN.1 aware validators, the XED
   framework provides the means to translate ASN.1 specifications into
   compatible XML Schema [CXSD] or RELAX NG [CRNG] specifications.  Note
   that RXER is specifically designed to facilitate the derivation of a
   compatible XML Schema or RELAX NG specification from an original
   ASN.1 specification.

   These translations are compatible with the original ASN.1 in the
   sense that any XML document that validates according to the ASN.1
   will also validate according to the XML Schema or RELAX NG
   translation, though the reverse is not necessarily true.  So the
   translations can be said to be no more restrictive than the original
   ASN.1, and may be less restrictive than the original ASN.1.

   A single-language validator can use a translation to validate markup
   conforming to a definition in a different schema language, though the
   validation it performs will probably be less thorough than that
   performed by a multi-schema validator.

   XED servers MUST use the original specification (not a translation)
   when validating any part of an XML document, whether the markup
   represents a protocol operation or a data value to be stored, to
   ensure the integrity of directory data.

   XED clients SHOULD use the original specification to validate but may
   instead use a translation, though many XED clients will have no
   compelling need to perform validation.  That is, they will generate
   valid markup as a matter of course, and will rely on XED servers to
   only return valid markup.  In such cases, translations serve as an
   aid to understanding rather than as a basis for implementation.

5.  User Defined Syntaxes

   While the creation of user-defined syntaxes for directory attributes
   is discouraged by LDAP, it is a central capability of XED.

   The ability for users to import schema definitions in the form of
   ASN.1 types has been notionally available in X.500 since the second



Legg & Prager              Expires 1 June 2006                  [Page 5]

   edition, however the capability has never previously been seriously
   supported.  In part this is because a full parser for the ASN.1
   language is difficult to write.  The XED framework overcomes this
   obstacle to the runtime acquisition of ASN.1 definitions by defining
   Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) [ASN.X][GSEREIT][XEREIT], a
   semantically equivalent XML representation for ASN.1 specifications.
   ASN.X completely avoids the inherent ambiguities of the ASN.1
   language and is therefore much easier to parse than ASN.1.  ASN.X, in
   conjunction with RXER, makes ASN.1 a fully-fledged schema language
   for XML.

   ASN.X is the preferred form for representing user-provided ASN.1
   specifications in XED.  The XED framework defines additional schema
   operational attributes [SCHEMA] to hold ASN.X documents, XML Schema
   documents, RELAX NG documents and DTDs, whose definitions may be
   referenced in the user-defined syntax definitions [SCHEMA] of new
   directory attribute types.  The XED framework also extends directory
   matching rules [MATCH], and in particular component matching rules
   [CMR], to apply to attribute values with a user-defined syntax
   specified in an XML schema language other than ASN.1.

6.  Protocols

   The Internet Directly Mapped (IDM) protocol [X.519] is a recent
   addition to X.500 whereby X.500 protocol operations can be exchanged
   between directory agents using TCP/IP [TCP] with minimal
   encapsulation.

   Protocol operations in the IDM protocol are encoded according to the
   Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [X.690] of ASN.1.  The XED framework
   introduces a new, exclusively XML-based protocol, called the XML
   Internet Directly Mapped (XIDM) protocol [XLDAP], which differs from
   the IDM protocol only in that the protocol operations are encoded
   using RXER [RXER] instead of BER.

   Whilst the IDM protocol is amenable to a simple substitution of the
   encoding rules to create a uniformly XML formatted protocol
   operation, LDAP is not, due to discontinuities in the encoding, i.e.,
   places where transfer syntax transitions occur (typically from BER to
   LDAP-specific [SYNTAX] and back to BER).  A straight application of
   RXER to an LDAP operation would inconveniently force directory
   attribute values, among other things, to be represented as
   hexadecimal strings.

   However, within the XED framework the LDAP ASN.1 specification is
   transformed to create a new specification without the
   discontinuities.  Essentially, the bland OCTET STRING [X.680]
   containers for directory data items in LDAP are replaced by the open

   types [X.681] and specific types used by X.500.  The XML Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (XLDAP) [XLDAP] is the result of applying
   RXER to instances of the message types of the transformed
   specification.  Apart from the change in syntax, XLDAP is
   semantically equivalent to LDAP.

   Since the XED protocols are algorithmically generated from the LDAP
   and X.500 specifications, all future extensions to LDAP and X.500
   automatically acquire a XED protocol representation.

7.  Security Considerations

   Since XED is derived from LDAP and X.500 the security considerations
   that apply to LDAP and X.500 apply equally to XED.

   The XED protocols encode all attribute values using RXER, which does
   not necessarily enable the exact BER encoding of an attribute value
   to be recovered.  Such recovery is needed for the verification of
   digital signatures.  The XED protocols MUST NOT be used by
   applications requiring such recovery.

   When interpreting security-sensitive fields, and in particular fields
   used to grant or deny access, implementations MUST ensure that any
   comparisons are done on the underlying abstract value, regardless of
   the particular encoding used.
