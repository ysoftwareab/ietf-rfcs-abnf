   ABSTRACT
	This terminology document provides the terms to be used for 
   benchmarking router software under accelerated stress conditions.
   A framework is defined to configure routing protocols, security 
   policies, traffic forwarding, and management.  Conditions to 
   produce instability and accelerate operational conditions are 
   also defined.  Benchmarks for evaluating a router subjected to 
   the accelerated life test are introduced.  The DUT configuration
   and accelerated stress conditions emulate those of Internet 
   Core routers.

   1. Introduction

   Router testing benchmarks have consistently been made in a 
   monolithic fashion in which a single protocol or behavior is 
   measured in an isolated environment.  It is important to know the 
   limits for a router/switch's (hereby referred to as Router) behavior 
   for each protocol, however this does not produce a reliable benchmark 
   of the router's behavior in a deployed network.  Routers in an 
   operational network are simultaneously configured with multiple 
   protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and being 
   managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is 
   necessary to test that router in operational conditions by 
   simultaneously configuring the network protocols and security 
   policies, sourcing traffic, and managing the router.  It is helpful

INTERNET-DRAFT Terminology for Benchmarking Software Core   June 2003
           	Router Software Accelerated Life Testing
  
   to accelerate these network operational conditions so that the 
   router under test can be benchmarked with faster test duration.  
   Testing a router in accelerated network conditions is known as 
   Accelerated Life Testing.  White Box benchmarks are defined in 
   Appendix 1.
   Accelerated Life Testing of Routers provides the following benefits:
   1. Evaluation of multiple protocols enabled simultaneously as 
      configured in deployed networks
   2. Evaluation of System and Software Stability
   3. Evaluation of Manageability under stressful conditions	
   4. Identification of Software Coding bugs such as:
	a. Memory Leaks
	b. Suboptimal CPU Utilization
	c. Coding Logic	

   These evaluations are externally observable to the DUT as control 
   plane or data plane errors. 	

   Configuration and operational conditions vary for Core, Peering, 
   Aggregate, and Edge Routers.  This document focuses on defining 
   the terminology for Accelerated Life Testing of Core Routers.  
   Terminology for configuring network conditions, accelerating 
   operational parameters, accelerating network instability, and 
   evaluating results are provided. 

   2.  Existing definitions

   RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect 
   Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching 
   Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this 
   document.

   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are
   indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   3. Term definitions

   3.1 Configuration Modules

      Definition:  
	The features and protocols enabled for the Accelerated Life 
	Test and conditions created during the test.

      Discussion:
	Features and Protocols are divided into four configuration 
	modules as shown in Figure 1.  These are the Control Plane, 
	Data Plane, Management Plane, and Security Plane.

   3.1.1 Control Plane Configuration Module

      Definition:  
	The control protocols enabled for the Accelerated Life Test.

      Discussion:
	Control Plane Configuration Module is divided into three 
	Configuration Sets as shown in Figure 2.  These are Routing 
	Protocol, Multicast, and MPLS.  These can be enabled or 
	disabled for a benchmark test.  For example, a network operator 
	that operates a network with BGP and an IGP without Multicast 
	and MPLS protocols can execute a benchmark test with the 
	Routing Protocol Configuration Set enabled and the Multicast 
	and MPLS Configuration Sets disabled.  Configuration Sets are 
	further explained in the next section.

  3.3.4 Route Convergence Due to Better Next-Hop

      Definition: 
	The rate at which routes in the FIB are replaced by a route 
	instance in the RIB with a different next-hop becoming more 
	preferred.

      Discussion:
	The route changes are due to attribute and TLV changes. RIB
	contains routes matching those in the FIB.  Convergence due 
	to better path can occur for BGP and IGP routes.

      Measurement units:
	more preferred routes per second

      Issues:
	None

   3.3.5 LSP Reroute Rate

     Definition: 
	The rate at which established LSPs experience a failure condition
	and are forced to reroute.

      Discussion:
	This instability condition defines the rate of repeated LSP 
	reroutes.  This produces great instability on the DUT due to 
	continuous tunnel path calculations and changes to the 
	forwarding table.  Rerouting can be performed with Headend
	Reroute, Standby LSP, or Fast Reroute.

      Measurement units:
	routes flapped per second
	
      Issues:
	None

   3.3.6 Intended Test Duration

      Definition:  
	The maximum targetted run time for Accelerated Life Test.

      Discussion:
	This is an instability condition because the protocol sessions 
	and scaling values must be maintained for this specified time with 
	interfaceshutdowns and route flapping.  The test may be halted
	upon reaching the Intended Test Duration. 

      Measurement units:
	Hours

   3.4 Evaluation Benchmarks

   3.4.1 Run-Time without Error

      Definition: 
	The run-time for the Accelerated Life Test without the DUT 
	exhibiting an error in the control plane, data plane, management 
	plane, or security plane.

      Discussion:
	For a successful test, the Run-Time Without Error will equal the 
	Intended Test Duration.  In the event of any failure, the Run-Time 
	Without Error is less than the Intended Test Duration and will equal 
	the maximum of the Run-Time without Control Plane Error, Run-Time 
	without Data Plane Error, Run-Time without Management Plane Error, 
	and Run-Time without Security Plane Error.

      Measurement units:
	Hours and Minutes

      Issues:
	None

   3.4.2 Run-Time without Control Plane Error

      Definition: 
	The run-time for the Accelerated Life Test without the DUT 
	exhibiting an error in the control plane to Routing, Multicast, 
	and MPLS Protocol. 

      Discussion:
	For a successful test, the Run-Time Without Control Plane Error 
	will equal the Run-Time without Error.  In the event of a Control 
	Plane failure, the Run-Time Without Control Plane Error is less 
	than the Run-Time without Error. 

      Measurement units:
	Hours and Minutes

      Issues:
	None

       Definition: 
	The run-time for the Accelerated Life Test without the DUT 
	exhibiting an error in the Data Plane for traffic forwarding 
	or DUT interfaces. 

      Discussion:
	For a successful test, the Run-Time Without Data Plane Error 
	will equal the Run-Time without Error.  In the event of a Data 
	Plane failure, the Run-Time Without Data Plane Error is less 
	than the Run-Time without Error.

      Definition: 
	The run-time for the Accelerated Life Test without the DUT 
	exhibiting an error in the Management Plane to User Access, 
	SNMP, or Logging/Debug. 

      Discussion:
	For a successful test, the Run-Time Without Management Plane 
	Error will equal the Run-Time without Error.  In the event of 
	a Management Plane failure, the Run-Time Without Management 
	Plane Error is less than the Run-Time without Error.

      Definition: 
	The run-time for the Accelerated Life Test without the DUT 
	exhibiting an error in the Security Plane to ACLs. 

      Discussion:
	For a successful test, the Run-Time Without Security Plane 
	Error will equal the Run-Time without Error.  In the event 
	of a Security Plane failure, the  Run-Time Without Control 
	Plane Error is less than the Run-Time without Error.

   4. Security Considerations
        Documents of this type do not directly effect the security of
        the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
