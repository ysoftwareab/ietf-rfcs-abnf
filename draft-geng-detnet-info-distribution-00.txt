         IGP-TE Extensions for DetNet Information Distribution
                 draft-geng-detnet-info-distribution-00

Abstract

   There are requirements in diverse industries to establish multi-hop
   paths for characterized flows with bounded end-to-end latency and
   extremely low packet loss rate.  Deterministic Networking (DetNet)
   can provide service satisfying the requirements.

   This document describes extensions to IGP-TE, including OSPF-TE and
   ISIS-TE to distribute information of DetNet, which can be used for
   DetNet path computation/selection.

   This document only covers the mechanisms by which DetNet information
   is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring, calculating or
   configuring DetNet capabilities, resources and other relevant
   parameters are out of the scope.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   There are many use cases from diverse industries which have the need
   in common for deterministic service, for example: audio video
   production, industrial process control and mobile access networks.
   The requirements can be summarized as:

      Deterministic minimum and maximum end-to-end latency from source
      to destination

      Extremely low packet loss rate

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) can satisfy the requirements by the
   following techniques:

   o  Congestion Protection by reserving data plane resources for DetNet
      flows in intermediate nodes along the path

   o  Explicit Route that do not rapidly change with the network
      topology

   o  Seamless Redundant which can distribute DetNet flow packets over
      multi paths to ensure delivery of each packet spite of the loss of
      a path

   To make the above techniques work, it's necessary to know the
   capabilities (e.g., DetNet capable or not, which congestion
   protection algorithms are supported, etc.), resources (e.g, dedicated
   bandwidth for DetNet, buffers, etc.), performance (e.g.,
   device/queue/link delay etc.) and other relevant information of each
   DetNet capable node.  Then, a DetNet path computation element (e.g.,
   PCE or ingress of a DetNet flow) can use these information to compute
   a path that satisfies the requirement of a specific DetNet flow.
   Specifically, according to the requirements stated in DetNet
   architecture, the information should include:

   o  Whether a node is DetNet capable

   o  Congestion protection methods supported by a DetNet capable node;

   o  Dedicated bandwidth for DetNet flows;

   o  Device and link delay;

   Some of information (e.g., Link delay/loss ) can be distributed and
   collected through the Traffic Engineering (TE) metric extensions
   [RFC7471], [RFC7810].

   This document defines extensions to OSPF and ISIS to distribute the
   above DetNet information that can not distributed by the existing
   protocols.

2.  Terminology

   All the DetNet related terminologies used in this document conform to
   the DetNet architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

3.  DetNet Extensions to OSPF TE

   This document defines new OSPF TE sub-TLVs for Link TLV to distribute
   the DetNet required information as stated in Section 1.  These sub-
   TLVs includes:

         |________|_______________|___________________________________|

3.1.  Congestion Protection Method sub-TLV

   This Congestion Protection (CP) Method sub-TLV is used to advertise
   the DetNet flow congestion protection methods used in transit nodes.
   It may be required by some DetNet flows that all the transit nodes
   along the path SHOULD use the same congestion protection method.
   Some typical congestion protection methods are listed as below:

      Time Aware Shaping [IIEEE802.1Qbv]

      Credit Based Shaper [IEEE802.1Q-2014]

      Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding [IEEE802.1Qch]

      Asynchronous Traffic Shaping [IEEE802.1Qcr]

   The format of this sub-TLV is shown in the following diagram:

   This Congestion Control Method field presents the congestion
   protection method used in the transit node.

   Five congestion protection methods are introduced in this document:

     _______________________________________________________________
     |  Value    |     Congestion Control Mechanisms               |

     |___________|_________________________________________________|

3.2.  Maximum DetNet Reservable Bandwidth sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that is
   reserved for DetNet on this link.  Note that this value SHOULD be
   smaller than the value of Maximum Reservable Bandwidth sub-TLV
   [RFC3630].  The value normally depends on the Congestion Protection
   Method and is user-configurable.  In some particular Congestion
   Protection Method (e.g.  Credit Based shaper in AVB), this value will
   affect the calculation of maximum queuing delay of the DetNet flow.
   The units are bytes per second.

   The format of this sub-TLV is shown in the following diagram:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   The Type field is 2 octets in length, and the value is TBD2.

   The Length field is 2 octets in length and its value is 4.

   The RESERVED field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to 0
   when sent and MUST be ignored when received.

   This Maximum DetNet Reservable Bandwidth presents the maximum
   bandwidth that may be reserved for DetNet.

3.3.  Available DetNet Bandwidth sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV specifies the available bandwidth that can be reserved
   for DetNet flow on this link for now.  Considering that there is no
   generally accepted DetNet traffic classification, this value contains
   all the available DetNet Bandwidth from different DetNet traffic
   classes (if there is any), which differs from the Unreserved
   Bandwidth defined in [RFC3630].

   The format of this sub-TLV is shown in the following diagram:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   The Type field is 2 octets in length, and the value is TBD3.

   The Length field is 2 octets in length and its value is 4.

   The RESERVED field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to 0
   when sent and MUST be ignored when received.

   This Available DetNet Bandwidth field presents the available
   bandwidth for DetNet in this link.

3.4.  Min/Max Queuing Delay sub-TLV

   [Editor Notes: more consideration and inputs are needed for these
   queue delays]

   This sub-TLV advertises the minimum and maximum queuing delay values
   of specific DetNet flow in the link.  Max/Min Unidirectional Link
   Delay Sub-TLV [RFC7471] excludes the queuing delay because of its
   instability.  With the techniques used in DetNet, the queuing delay
   can be limited to a reasonable range, which means that the queuing
   delay bound is stable enough to be defined as a sub-TLV and
   advertised over the network.

   The format of this sub-TLV is shown in the following diagram:

   when sent and MUST be ignored when received.

   Minimum DetNet Queuing Delay is 24-bit field carrying minimum queuing
   delay value (in microseconds) encoded as an integer value.
   Implementations may also add this to the value of Min Delay
   Unidirectional Link Delay Sub-TLV [RFC7471] in order to advertise the
   minimum delay of this link.  Min Queuing Delay can be the same with
   the Max Queuing Delay.

   The RESERVED field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to 0
   when sent and MUST be ignored when received.

   Maximum DetNet Queuing Delay is 24-bit field carrying the maximum

   The RESERVED field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to 0
   when sent and MUST be ignored when received.

   Minimum DetNet Queuing Delay is 24-bit field carrying minimum queuing
   delay value (in microseconds) encoded as an integer value.
   Implementations may also add this to the value of Min Unidirectional
   Link Delay [RFC7810] in order to advertise the minimum delay of this
   link.  Min Queuing Delay can be the same with the Max Queuing Delay.

   The RESERVED field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to 0
   when sent and MUST be ignored when received.

   Maximum DetNet Queuing Delay is 24-bit field carrying the maximum
   queuing delay value (in microseconds) encoded as an integer value.
   Implementations may also add this to the value of Max Delay
   Unidirectional Link Delay Sub-TLV [RFC7810] to order to advertise the
   maximum delay of this link.
