                  draft-ietf-netmod-factory-default-12

Abstract

   This document defines a method to reset a server to its factory
   default content.  The reset operation may be used, e.g., when the
   existing configuration has major errors so re-starting the
   configuration process from scratch is the best option.

   A new "factory-reset" RPC is defined.  When resetting a device, all
   previous configuration settings will be lost and replaced by the
   factory default content.

   A new optional "factory-default" read-only datastore is defined, that
   contains the factory default configuration for the device.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a method to reset a server to its factory
   default content.  The reset operation may be used, e.g., when the
   existing configuration has major errors so re-starting the
   configuration process from scratch is the best option.

   A "factory-reset" RPC is defined.  When resetting a device, all
   previous configuration settings will be lost and replaced by the
   factory default content.

   A "factory-default" read-only datastore is defined, that contains the
   data to replace the contents of implemented read-write conventional
   configuration datastores at reset.  This datastore can also be used
   in the <get-data> operation.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342].

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting           February 2020


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] [RFC7950] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  server

   o  startup configuration datastore

   o  candidate configuration datastore

   o  running configuration datastore

   o  intended configuration datastore

   o  operational state datastore

   o  conventional configuration datastore

   o  RPC operation

   The following terms are defined in this document as follows:

   o  factory-default datastore: A read-only configuration datastore
      holding a preconfigured initial configuration that is used to
      initialize the configuration of a server.

2.  Factory-Reset RPC

   A new "factory-reset" RPC is introduced.  Upon receiving the RPC

   o  All supported conventional read-write configuration datastores
      (i.e. <running>, <startup>, and <candidate>) are all reset to the
      contents of <factory-default>.

   o  Read-only datastores receive their content from other
      datastores(e.g. <intended> gets its content from <running>).

   o  All data in any ephemeral datastores MUST be discarded.






Wu, et al.               Expires August 19, 2020                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting           February 2020


   o  The contents of the <operational> datastore MUST reflect the
      operational state of the device after applying the factory default
      configuration.

   In addition, the "factory-reset" RPC MUST restore non-volatile
   storage to factory condition.  Depending on the system, this may
   entail deleting dynamically generated files, such as those containing
   keys (e.g., /etc/ssl/private), certificates (e.g., /etc/ssl), logs
   (e.g., /var/log), and temporary files (e.g., /tmp/*).  All security
   sensitive data (i.e., private keys, passwords, etc.)  SHOULD be
   overwritten with zeros or a pattern before deletion.  The "factory-
   reset" RPC MAY also be used to trigger some other resetting tasks
   such as restarting the node or some of the software processes.

   Note that operators should be aware that since all read-write
   datastores are immediately reset to factory default, the device may
   become unreachable on the network.  It is important to understand how
   a given vendor's device will behave after the RPC is executed.
   Implementors SHOULD reboot the device or otherwise restart processes
   needed to bootstrap it.

3.  Factory-Default Datastore

   Following the guidelines for defining Datastores in the appendix A of
   [RFC8342], this document introduces a new optional datastore resource
   named "factory-default" that represents a preconfigured minimal
   initial configuration that can be used to initialize the
   configuration of a server.  A device MAY implement the "factory-
   reset" RPC without implementing the "factory-default" datastore,
   which would only eliminate the ability to programmatically determine
   the factory default configuration.

   o  Name: "factory-default"

   o  YANG modules: all

   o  YANG nodes: all "config true" data nodes

   o  Management operations: The content of the datastore is set by the
      server in an implementation dependent manner.  The content can not
      be changed by management operations via NETCONF, RESTCONF, the CLI
      etc.  unless specialized, dedicated operations are provided.  The
      datastore can be read using the standard NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol
      operations.  The "factory-reset" operation copies the factory
      default content to <running> and, if present, <startup> and/or
      <candidate> and then the content of these datastores is propagated
      automatically to any other read only datastores, e.g., <intended>
      and <operational>.

   o  Origin: This document does not define a new origin identity as it
      does not interact with <operational> datastore.

   o  Protocols: RESTCONF, NETCONF and other management protocol.

   o  Defining YANG module: "ietf-factory-default".

   The contents of <factory-default> is defined by the device vendor and
   MUST persist across device restarts.

4.  YANG Module

   This module uses the "datastore" identity [RFC8342], and the
   "default-deny-all" extension statement from [RFC8341].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].
   The following registration has been made:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default
     Registrant Contact: The IESG.
     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   Registry [RFC6020].  The following registration has been made:

     name: ietf-factory-default
     namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default
     prefix: fd
     RFC: xxxx

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document extends the base operations
   for NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   Access to the "factory-reset" RPC operation is considered sensitive
   and therefore has been restricted using the "default-deny-all" access
   control defined in [RFC8341].

   The "factory-reset" RPC can prevent any further management of the
   device if the session and client config is included in the factory
   default contents.

   The operational disruption caused by setting the config to factory
   default contents varies greatly depending on the implementation and
   current config.
