               Operating a Glueless DNS Authority Server
                    draft-dickson-dnsop-glueless-02

Abstract

   This Internet Draft proposes a method for protecting authority
   servers against MITM and poisoning attacks, using a domain naming
   strategy to not require glue A/AAAA records and use of DNSSEC.

   This technique assumes the use of validating resolvers.

   MITM and poisoning attacks should only be effective/possible against
   unsigned domains.

   However, until all domains are signed, this guidance is relevant, in
   that it can limit the attack surface of unsigned domains.

   This guidance should be combined with [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack]

1.  Introduction

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are additions to the DNS protocol
   which provide data integrity and authenticity protections, but do not
   provide privacy.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background

   Use of DNSSEC requires upgrades to software for authorative servers,
   resolvers, and optionally clients, in order to benefit from these
   protections.  It also requires that DNS operators actually sign their
   zones and secure the corresponding delegations at the parent.

   When a given domain is unsigned or not securely delegated, those
   protections to the zone contents are not available.

   Any such insecure domain is trivially able to be altered by an on-
   path attacker.

   An off-path attacker is limited to use of cache poisoning attacks.

   However, some class of cache poisoning attacks target unsigned
   delegation data.  These records consist of the necessary NS records,
   and when necessary, "glue" records for IP addresses corresponding to
   these NS records.

   The impact to successful cache poisoning of delegation records is
   that the attacker may substitute their own name servers for the
   legitimate name server.  In other words, the attacker is able to
   promote itself to being effectively on-path, and trivially modify
   unsigned domain results.

4.  Proposed Solutions

   This work does not propose any protocol changes.  It provides
   guidance on strategies and techniques for name server naming.

   There are two kinds of delegation records that require protection
   against off-path attackers, for unsigned domains.

   For protecting NS records used in delegations, there is a new
   proposal for use of a new DS record.  See [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack]
   for details.

   The present draft addresses the "glue" records, by recommending
   methods to make them mostly unnecessary.  If there is no delegation
   glue data, an attacker cannot poison that data.  The resolver cache
   would contain only authoritative address records associated with NS
   names.  Authoritative data cannot be pre-empted by such poisoning
   attacks, since those are only able to replace less trusted glue
   records.

   Additional recommendations are made to reduce the chances for errors
   caused by DNS operators when changing delegation records, by avoiding
   re-use of name server names which require glue address records.

5.  Terminology:

   The following terms are used to disambiguate domains and server
   names:

   *  Registered domain - end-user (registrant) domain

Internet-Draft                Glueless DNS                September 2021


      -  In the parent zone, the registered domain is the left-hand side
         of the NS record

   *  Registered domain name server - the name of the name server
      serving the registered domain

      -  In the parent zone, the registered domain name server is the
         right-hand side of the NS record

6.  Recommendations

   The following practice is RECOMMENDED for unsigned domains:

   *  Do not use in-bailiwick registered domain name servers for
      unsigned domains.

   *  Instead, use out-of-zone names for the registered domain name
      servers of unsigned domains.

   Example:

   Do NOT do the following (delegations requiring glue):
   $ORIGIN example.
   // Records in example TLD, with relative names
   unsigned-domain NS ns1.unsigned-domain
   unsigned-domain NS ns2.unsigned-domain
   // glue
   // "strictly necessary glue"
   // always required for successful resolution
   ns1.unsigned-domain A (IP address)
   ns1.unsigned-domain AAAA (IP address)
   ns2.unsigned-domain A (IP address)
   ns2.unsigned-domain AAAA (IP address)

   Instead, do the following (glueless delegations):
   $ORIGIN example.
   // Records in example TLD, with relative names
   // This is the minimum "glueless" set-up
   // NS target name is not a "registered" host
   // NS target is not used for glue for any domains
   unsigned-domain NS ns1.nameserver-signed-domain
   unsigned-domain NS ns2.nameserver-signed-domain
   //
   // Delegation to signed domain containing name server names
   // (This domain serves the address records of name servers
   //  such as the glueless example above)
   nameserver-signed-domain NS ns1.nameserver-signed-domain
   nameserver-signed-domain NS ns2.nameserver-signed-domain
   nameserver-signed-domain DS (DS record data)
   // However, this domain needs to be resolvable, and needs glue
   // glue records for this delegation
   ns1.nameserver-signed-domain A (IP address)
   ns1.nameserver-signed-domain A (IP address)
   ns2.nameserver-signed-domain AAAA (IP address)
   ns2.nameserver-signed-domain AAAA (IP address)

   The following practice is RECOMMENDED:

   *  For any name server domain (domain containing addresses and
      related data for name servers used by registered domains), use
      distinct dedicated name servers for the domain itself

      -  I.e. avoid sharing name servers between the name server domain
         and any registered domains

   *  Consider making the name server domain itself fully glueless, with
      an out-of-zone name server (using a tertiary domain)

Internet-Draft                Glueless DNS                September 2021


   *  For this tertiary domain, also consider using separating the in-
      bailiwick name servers, from the names used for serving the name
      server domain

      -  Limiting the in-bailiwick NS names ensures that changes and
         updates to the tertiary domain don't affect any other domains

      -  Depending on parent zone policy (e.g.  TLD database policy),
         renaming or renumbering name servers may affect delegations
         using them (NS entries)

      -  A single domain with non-reused NS names guarantees side
         effects of this sort are not possible

   *  Overhead of tertiary domain and not re-using (or sharing) name
      server names in the tertiary domain:

      -  Additional lookups are required on the initial reference to get
         the addresses of name servers for the main glueless domain

      -  Subsequent (new) queries for the IP addresses of glueless name
         servers only require single queries

   Example:

   Entries in the example TLD
   $ORIGIN example.
   //
   // Same unsigned domain uses the same name servers
   // However, the name server is in its own glueless domain
   unsigned-registrant-domain NS ns1.signed-nameserver-domain
   unsigned-registrant-domain NS ns2.signed-nameserver-domain
   //
   signed-nameserver-domain NS ns1.tertiary-domain
   signed-nameserver-domain NS ns2.tertiary-domain
   signed-nameserver-domain DS (DS record data)
   //
   tertiary-domain NS special-ns1.tertiary-domain
   tertiary-domain NS special-ns2.tertiary-domain
   tertiary-domain DS (DS record data)
   // glue for special-ns1 and -2
   // special-ns1 and -2 are used only for/by tertiary-domain
   special-ns1.tertiary-domain A (IP address)
   special-ns1.tertiary-domain AAAA (IP address)
   special-ns2.tertiary-domain A (IP address)
   special-ns2.tertiary-domain AAAA (IP address)

7.  Security Considerations

   This guidance is useful in preventing off-path attackers from
   poisoning DNS cache entries necessary for delegations.

   However, an on-path attacker is still able to manipulate DNS
   responses sent over UDP or unencrypted TCP.

   This guidance is not a substitute for use of DNSSEC for DNS domains.
   The only mechanism that can protect against on-path attackers is
   cryptographic protection DNSSEC signing of domains is both necessary
   and sufficient to provide data integrity protection.

   Use of an encrypted transport is may be effective at preventing MITM
   attacks (i.e.  DNS over TLS from resolver to authoritative server,
   aka ADoT), but does not provide provable data integrity.

   Encrypted transport may be used in combination with DNSSEC signed
   zones and glueless name server domains.

   Encrypted transport does not incrementally improve the data integrity
   or protection against MITM.  DNSSEC is sufficient alone for this
   purpose.  However, encrypted transport does add privacy protection
   against passive observers.
