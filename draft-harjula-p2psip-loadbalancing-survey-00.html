<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
		This draft provides a review of the proposed load balancing methods for structured (DHT-based) P2P systems, 
		and introduces their operating principles and main characteristics. To maximize performance, reliability 
		and fairness of a structured P2P system, the load between the nodes should be equally or nearly equally 
		distributed. Structured P2P systems are usually based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), that distribute 
		peers to the identifier space and objects among peers by choosing random identifiers for them. In the worst 
		case, this may result in O(log N) imbalance of object distribution between the peers, causing high degree 
		of heterogeneity in loads of peer nodes. Other sources for load imbalance are frequent arrival and 
		departure of nodes (i.e. churn) and the variation in both the size and the popularity of objects. Load 
		balancing in structured P2P systems has been thoroughly studied during the past years. In this draft, we 
		introduce and compare the existing fundamental load balancing models.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
		In most of the dedicated client/server systems it is enough to prevent the load within a node to grow 
		in such extent that it would fail in performing its tasks. However, in P2P systems the requirements for 
		the fairness of load balancing are higher since P2P nodes are not usually dedicated to certain tasks. 
		Instead, the P2P software usually runs on the background while the user is doing something else with 
		the node. This emphasizes the importance of fair load distribution between the networked nodes.
       	
</p>
<p>
		The network management and routing in structured P2P systems are based on a collaborative effort of the 
		participating nodes instead of centralized solutions. Structured P2P networks were developed to improve 
		routing efficiency and success rate, and thus to decrease the communication overhead. In structured P2P 
		networks, the overlay uses specialized algorithms for generating topologies for the nodes participating 
		the system. The overlay has specific control for the routing between the nodes, and the overlay controls 
		the content placement. Thus, the exact location of the specific content is always known by the overlay. 
		The load generated by the overlay signaling, is called signaling load. Another source of load in P2P 
		networks is data transfer load, which originates from content transfers between the nodes. In the basic 
		P2P scenario, the content is moved directly between the nodes, and thus the content transfer generates 
		load only to the source and target node. In addition, most of the systems allows the content to be 
		stored outside the node which is actually sharing it. In the case of realtime content, the media cannot 
		be split in similar manner to third party nodes. However, the realtime streams may be routed through one 
		or more third party nodes. The reason for using third party streaming relays is usually the restrictions 
		of the access network of source or target node, such as Network Addres Translation (NAT).
		
</p>
<p>
		This draft provides a survey of the existing and emerging load balancing technologies in the area of 
		signaling in structured P2P networking. The main purpose of this draft is to provide a scientific 
		background for defining which load balancing model or models are the most suitable for P2PSIP
		environment.

Fundamental load balancing models</h3>

<p> 
		Load balancing in P2P has special aspects and requirements that distinguish it from load balancing in
		distributed server systems. P2P systems usually consist of two distinguishable functions: 1) Search
		and discovery of nodes, content, or services (also called as signaling part), and 2) Transferring
		content or information between the nodes in either realtime or non-realtime manner (also called as
		media part). Thus, also load balancing has to consider both parts. In the first version of this
		draft, we consider only signaling part. However, also media transfer-related load balancing
		mechanisms has to be considered. This part remains in TBD status.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Virtual servers</h3>

<p>
			During the past years, a great deal of research has been conducted to improve the load 
			balancing in structured P2P networks. Many of the proposed load balancing mechanisms are based 
			on the concept of virtual servers <a class='info' href='#CHORD'>[CHORD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stoica, I., Morris, R., Liben-Nowell, D., Karger, D., Kaashoek, M., Dabek, F., and H. Balakrishnan, &ldquo;Chord: a scalable peer-to-peer lookup protocol for Internet applications,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, where single physical node may host 
			several virtual servers that are all participating independently the same overlay. The concept 
			of multiple virtual servers per physical node balances the load statistically. The model also 
			enables resource-aware load balancing, since the number of virtual servers allocated per node 
			can vary. In dynamic virtual server load balancing <a class='info' href='#VIRTUALSERVER_1'>[VIRTUALSERVER_1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rao, A., Laksminarayanan, K., Surana, S., Karp, R., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Load Balancing in Structured P2P Systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#VIRTUALSERVER_2'>[VIRTUALSERVER_2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dabek, F., Kaashoek, M., Karger, D., Morris, R., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;Wide-area Cooperative Storage with CFS,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, the load between the physical nodes is balanced by dynamically 
			controlling the number of virtual servers per physical node (i.e. moving them between physical 
			nodes during runtime).

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Controlling the object location</h3>

<p>
			Another fundamental load balancing concept is to directly control the object location on the 
			overlay. Power of Two Choices <a class='info' href='#POWEROF2'>[POWEROF2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Byers, J., Considine, J., and M. Mitzenmacher, &ldquo;Simple Load Balancing for DHTs,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, is based on the concept of using multiple hash 
			functions per object. When inserting an object to an overlay, all respective hash values are 
			computed and the load information of the corresponding peer candidates is retrieved. Finally, 
			the object is stored on the peer with the lightest load. Searching the object can be implemented 
			by; 1) sending separate lookups using each respective hash values, or 2) using redirection 
			pointers between the corresponding peer candidates, and sending single lookup using some of the 
			hash functions (if the peer receiving the lookup does not contain the object, it forwards the 
			request to the containing peer, using the redirection pointer).

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Controlling the node location</h3>

<p>
			Controlling the node location on the overlay can as well be used for load balancing.  Node 
			migration, proposed by Karger&Ruhl <a class='info' href='#SIMPLELOADBAL'>[SIMPLELOADBAL]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karger, D. and M. Ruhl, &ldquo;Simple Efficient Load Balancing Algorithms for Peer-to-Peer Systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, is a mechanism allowing 
			underloaded nodes to migrate to portions of the address space occupied by too many data items, 
			to share the load of the node responsible for the overloaded address space. In this model, an 
			underloaded node queries the load of a randomly chosen remote node and makes a pairwise load 
			comparison between itself and the remote node. If the load of the remote node is higher, the node 
			relocates to share the address space of the remote node. Rieche et al <a class='info' href='#HEATDISP'>[HEATDISP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rieche, S., Petra, L., and K. Wehrle, &ldquo;A Thermal-Dissipation-based Approach for Balancing Data Load in Distributed Hash Tables,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, 
			presented another load balancing model, which is fundamentally based on moving objects between 
			the overlay nodes. In this model, the address space is divided to intervals, containing f nodes, 
			where f is a fixed minimum number of nodes assigned to an interval. The nodes within the interval 
			are collectively responsible for all of the objects stored in the interval. If the interval gets 
			overloaded,; 1) the overloaded interval can be split to two intervals if the interval contains 
			more than 2f nodes, 2) move nodes from other intervals to the overloaded interval to reach 2f 
			nodes in the interval and split it (as in the first case), or 3) move the border between the 
			overloaded interval and its successor or predecessor to balance the load between them.

<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Address space balancing</h3>

<p>
			Yet another fundamental load balancing model is address space balancing between the overlay nodes. 
			The concept was introduced in <a class='info' href='#SIMPLELOADBAL'>[SIMPLELOADBAL]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karger, D. and M. Ruhl, &ldquo;Simple Efficient Load Balancing Algorithms for Peer-to-Peer Systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, together with the previously introduced 
			object location controlling model. The main idea in the address space balancing is that each node 
			has a fixed set of O(log N) possible locations, called virtual nodes, on the overlay, calculated 
			using different hash algorithms (notice the difference in the terms between virtual node and virtual 
			server). Each node has only one of these virtual nodes active at any time. The virtual node that 
			spans the smallest address space between the real node owning it and the succeeding real node, is 
			selected as the active node. The selection is made occasionally. With high probability, each node 
			will be responsible for O(1/N) fraction of the address space.

Other mechanisms</h3>

<p>
			Several improvements have been developed for most of the presented fundamental load balancing 
			models, offering e.g. better performance, lower overhead or locality awareness. However, as they do 
			not significantly change the fundamental working principles, they are not presented as separate 
			load balancing categories.

Performance Analysis</h3>

<p>
		Common goal for each of the presented fundamental load balancing mechanisms is to achieve fair load
		distribution between the overlay nodes without generating too much overhead to the overlay. However,
		there are significant differences in both the fairness of load distribution and the generated overhead.
		The following subsections discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each of the presented fundamental 
		mechanisms.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Virtual servers</h3>

<p>
			In its basic form, the virtual server model affects the load balance statistically. The situation 
			can be compared to throwing a die once versus throwing it n times and calculating their average
			result. Even though simple and powerful, this method is also unable to address neither the  
			heterogeneity in the node capabilities nor the dynamic changes in the load. The heterogeneity 
			between the nodes can be addressed by allocating more virtual servers to higher-capacity devices
			and less virtual servers to lower-capacity devices. Dynamic load variations can be addressed by
			a mechanism that allows moving virtual nodes (and the objects they are responsible for) between
			the nodes during runtime.  
			
</p>
<p>
			The general problem with the virtual server model is the overhead it generates. As a physical
			node appears as multiple virtual nodes in the overlay, the overlay size grows with O(N) relation 
			to the number of virtual nodes per physical device.  The problem is emphasized with structured 
			P2P networks, due to their dependence on network management signaling, which grows with the 
			overlay size. With some optimizations, such as sending only one request message per physical node 
			and keeping common node-specific routing tables, the signaling overhead does not grow with the 
			same proportion, but is still a major problem. The situation gets even worse with dynamic load 
			balancing, which requires mechanisms for runtime load monitoring and moving virtual nodes between 
			the nodes.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Controlling the object location</h3>

<p>
			Controlling the object location, with e.g. the power of two choices method, is simple but 
			efficient load balancing method. The method does not generate any additional management overhead,
			since each physical device appears as a single node in the overlay, in contrast to the virtual 
			server model. Instead, the model generates some additional overhead to payload messaging due to
			the redundancy in storing and looking up an object. However, as proved by multiple research results
			[REFERENCES], the management signaling dominates the traffic in structured P2P networks. Thus, the 
			generated overall overhead is significantly lower than with virtual server model in most of the P2P 
			networks. With redirection pointers, the payload signaling overhead can be alleviated with the 
			cost of increased maintenance signalling, as the pointers need maintenance.
			
</p>
<p>
			The basic model of power of two choices is a passive mechanism, i.e. it does not provide active 
			load transfers between the nodes. Thus, even though with high probability an overloaded node does
			not receive any additional objects during runtime, the objects (causing overload to the node) cannot 
			be moved to another node. However, if the redirection pointers are in use, and thus the responsible 
			node candidates for a certain object know each other, they can move objects between each other to 
			provide dynamic load balancing. In general, the model works better in dynamic, high churn networks 
			with short object lifetimes. The model also inherently takes into account the node heterogeneity,
			as the load is calculated locally at each node.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Controlling the node location</h3>

<p>
			Similarly to previous model, controlling the node location aims to balance the load between 
			nodes by controlling the number of objects per node. However, instead of controlling object 
			locations, the locations of nodes themselves are controlled by the load balancing mechanism. 
			In a passive form, additional overhead is generated only during the joining phase and when the 
			nodes are looked up. Object lookups are not affected by the model. Active node location management
			generates also load transfer overhead, as the objects are moved between the moved node and the node
			taking over the objects the moving node was storing in the original location and, similarly, between 
			the moving node and the node that was holding the objects in the new location. Depending on the 
			used load balancing model, the distribution of load information between the devices may also
			generate overhead to the overlay. Also this model takes into account the node heterogeneity, 
            as the load is calculated locally.

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h3>4.4.&nbsp;
Address space balancing</h3>

<p> 
			This load balancing model is somehow similar to the previously presented node location management 
			mechanism, but the goal is different. Address space balancing aims to place the nodes to the 
			overlay so that the address space controlled by each node is as equal as possible. This model
			generates management and load transfer overhead, as the node optimum node location is determined
			every time the address space of a node is changed due to neighbour node departures and new node 
			arrivals, and changed when needed. A drawback of this model is that it does not take into account 
			the actual load of the node.
