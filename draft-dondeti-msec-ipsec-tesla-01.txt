   addition to the source authentication using TESLA, group
   authentication of the ESP packet can be provided using a shared

1.  Introduction

   The IPsec Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] provides a
   set of security services that include data origin authentication,
   which enables an IPsec receiver to validate that a received packet
   originated from a peer-sender in a pairwise security association
   (SA).  A Message Authentication Code (MAC) based on a symmetric key
   is the common means to provide data origin authentication for
   pairwise IPsec SAs.  However, for secure groups such as IP multicast
   groups, a MAC supports only "group authentication" and not data
   origin authentication.  This document specifies a ESP data origin
   authentication transform based on TESLA, for source authentication of
   data sent to groups of receivers.

   The description of the TESLA protocol itself is available in RFC 4082
   [RFC4082].  The TESLA authentication itself is protected from DoS
   attacks by an external authentication transform using a symmetric-key
   based MAC.  Thus senders first source authenticate a packet and then
   protect it with group authentication.  The receivers verify the
   external MAC to rule out any attacks from parties outside of the
   secure group and then proceed to verify that the message originated
   from the claimed source following the TESLA procedures.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   In addition, the following terms are defined and used in this
   document:

   Group Secrecy (GS):  Group Secrecy ensures that transmitted data is
      accessible only to group members.  This can also be viewed as a
      way to enforce access control.  A typical realization of GS is to
      encrypt data using a key known only to group members.
      Essentially, the solution for multicast is the same as the
      solution for unicast confidentiality.

   Group Authentication (GA):  The GA functionality enables a group
      member to verify that the received data originated from someone in
      the group and was not modified en-route by a non-group member.
      Note that group authentication by itself does not identify the
      source of the data.  For example, the data might have been forged
      by any malicious group member.  GA can be efficiently realized
      using standard shared key authentication mechanisms such as
      Message Authentication Codes (MACs), e.g., CBC-MAC or HMAC.

Internet-Draft                 IPsec TESLA                  October 2006


   Source and Data Authentication (SrA):  The SrA functionality enables
      a group member to verify that the received data originated from
      the claimed source and was not modified en-route by anyone
      (including other group members).  Unlike Group Authentication, SrA
      provides the IPsec data origin authentication function.  SrA
      provides a much stronger security guarantee than GA in that a
      particular group member can be identified as a source of a packet.


3.  Notes on IPsec ESP and TESLA

   IPsec ESP provides confidentiality, integrity protection, replay
   protection and traffic flow confidentiality.  Integrity protection
   may be provided using symmetric keys or digital signatures [RFC4359].
   For unicast communication, integrity protection using either
   mechanism provides data origin authentication.  In case of multicast
   or group communication, symmetric-key based integrity protection
   supports group authentication only.  For source authentication of
   multicast streams, the sender may sign every packet [RFC4359], TESLA
   or another source authentication mechanism.

   TESLA uses symmetric key chain commitment, delayed disclosure of a
   key from the key chain, and loose time synchronization between the
   sender's and the receivers' clocks to support source and data origin
   authentication.  The delayed disclosure of keys from the key chain
   implies that the receivers must buffer packets until the
   authentication can be verified.  To avoid denial of service attacks
   taking advantage of this buffering requirement, TESLA protected
   packets may be further protected using group authentication of
   packets.  That limits any such denial of service attacks to members
   of the secure group.

   TESLA receivers may be bootstrapped using a digitally signed
   broadcast message containing the commitment to a key chain, local
   time, disclosure delay and other TESLA parameters from the sender or
   via individual registration processes with the sender.  Bootstrapping
   of TESLA is out of scope for this document.  The key management
   protocol that establishes the IPsec SA can be used for bootstrapping
   the receivers.


4.  IPsec ESP Packet Format with TESLA

   In the following we first describe the TESLA authentication fields,
   followed by a depiction of where the those fields fit in an IPsec ESP
   packet.  Figure 2 also shows the coverage of encryption (when the
   encryption algorithm is non-NULL), IPsec integrity protection (IPsec
   ICV), and the TESLA MAC.

   The TESLA Authentication Fields are as follows:

   o  Id i of K_i (OPTIONAL) -- The 32-bit Id of the key used to compute
      the TESLA-MAC of the current packet: Within the TESLA tag, the Id
      i of K_i MAY be sent with the MAC of the message M computed using
      K_i.  If i is not included in the message, the receiver determines
      i by the time the packet was received and the maximum time
      displacement from the server.  With this time it then can
      determine the sender's current interval i.

   o  Disclosed Key K_(i-d) -- Variable length disclosed key is
      MANDATORY and is used to authenticate previous packets from
      earlier time intervals.

   o  TESLA MAC (K'_i, M): Variable length, MANDATORY.  TESLA MAC is
      computed using the key K'_i (derived from K_i) [RFC4082], which is
      disclosed in a subsequent packet (in the Disclosed Key field).
      The MAC coverage is shown in Figure 2.

   o  The label "Encyrpt" indicates the coverage of IPsec encryption.
      It is the same as that described in the IPsec ESP specification
      [RFC4303].

   o  The label "IPsec ICV" indicates IPsec ESP's ICV coverage.  Whether
      the ICV is present and its coverage of the fields of the IPsec
      packet is as specified in the ESP specification.

   o  The label "TESLA MAC" indicates the TESLA MAC coverage.  The TESLA
      MAC protects the IPsec ESP packet starting with the Sequence
      number and ending with the Next Header field.

4.1.  On the presence of the IPsec ICV in TESLA protected ESP packets

   IPsec ESP mandates the presence of an Integrity Check Value (ICV),
   except when combined mode algorithms are used to protect the packet
   and the ICV is part of the combined mode algorithm.  In case of CCM,
   the ICV is encrypted and only parseable at the receiver after
   decryption.  With TESLA protection of a packet, technically an ICV is
   not required for integrity protection of the packet.  However, as

Internet-Draft                 IPsec TESLA                  October 2006


   noted above, a symmetric-key based ICV has the advantage of
   protecting against some DoS attacks on TESLA, so ICV is REQUIRED to
   be present in ESP-TESLA.


5.  Cryptographic algorithms for IPsec ESP with TESLA

   TESLA needs a PRF algorithm to derive keys in the key chain.  TESLA
   PRF algorithm is specified through the key management protocol that
   distributes the ESP SA.

   The TESLA MAC algorithm is also specified through the key management
   protocol.  There is no reason for this algorithm to be different from
   the IPsec ICV algorithm.  When the TESLA MAC algorithm is not
   explicitly specified, the receivers are REQUIRED to use the IPsec ICV
   algorithm to compute the TESLA MAC algorithm.

   In the single sender group communication, all encryption algorithms
   that are appropriate for unicast communication are also suitable for
   secure group communication.  In the multi-sender communication case,
   the counter mode algorithms cannot be used in the same way they are
   used for the unicast case.  Specifically, a sequence number is
   typically used as the IV or the counter for encryption as well as for
   replay protection.  To do the same in the multi-sender case, requires
   careful management of the sequence number space between the multiple
   senders.  In this version of this document, counter mode encryption
   of multicast ESP packets for the multi-sender case, is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.


6.  Sender processing

   In addition to the steps in [RFC4303], the sender follows the steps
   below for TESLA protected packets:

   o  The sender determines the current TESLA time interval i.  The
      value of i is the first of the TESLA Authentication Fields.

   o  The sender then includes the TESLA Key, K_(i-d), where d is the
      TESLA disclosure delay.

   o  Next, it computes the TESLA MAC over the IPsec ESP packet,
      starting at the Sequence Number field and ending with the Next
      Header field, using the TESLA Key K_i.  That key itself SHALL NOT
      be disclosed until the TESLA interval i+d.

   o  The sender includes all the TESLA Authentication Fields after the
      Next Header field of the ESP packet and proceeds to compute the

Internet-Draft                 IPsec TESLA                  October 2006


      IPsec ICV over the entire ESP packet excluding the ICV field
      itself.


7.  Receiver processing

   Receiver processing of TESLA packets contains the following steps:

   o  When a receiver receives an ESP packet with TESLA fields, it must
      first check to see that the time interval of the message does not
      violate the security conditions for the keys used.  The message is
      buffered, and the receiver attempts to authenticate any messages
      which are authenticated using K_(i-d), i.e., messages received
      with the index i-d.

   o  If i is not included in the message, the receiver determines i by
      the time the packet was received and the maximum time displacement
      from the server.  With this time it then can determine the
      sender's current interval i.

   o  When the receiver receives a TESLA protected ESP packet it first
      needs to verify whether the packet is safe, which is to check that
      the key used to compute the MAC of the packet was still secret
      upon packet arrival.  For this, the receiver computes an upper
      bound on the sender's clock, and checks that the MAC key is still
      secret (based on the key disclosure schedule).  If the packet is
      safe, the receiver buffers the packet.

   o  Once the receiver has determined i, either directly or by the
      sender's time, it checks K_(i-d) against the most recently stored
      key, K_c.  If i-d=c then the receiver does nothing.  Otherwise it
      applies the PRF (i-d)-c times to K_(i-d) which should yield K_c.
      If K_(i-d) is authentic, the receiver uses it to authenticate all
      messages which used keys in the range K_(c+1) ..  K_(i-d) as the
      MAC key.  Finally the receiver replaces K_c with K_(i-d).  Note,
      that if i-d < c the packet would have been unsafe and discarded
      before this step.

   o  A message in this interval may be authentic or tainted.  Dealing
      with tainted messages is left to the implementor.  It is possible
      that the sender and receiver have fallen out of sync, in which
      case it is RECOMMENDED that they resynchronize times.  If i is not
      included in the message to the receiver and the two have fallen
      out of sync, the receiver will not correctly compute i, and
      failure will occur when attempting to authenticate the key.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document extends IPsec ESP authentication and encryption
   transforms to support IP multicast delivery.  IPsec ESP provides
   access control, rejection of replayed packets, confidentiality
   (encryption), limited traffic-flow confidentiality and connectionless
   integrity.  ESP supports a datagram environment where each IP packet
   is cryptographically independent of other IP packets and can be
   decrypted, authenticated, and integrity checked when delayed,
   reordered, or when other packets from the flow are lost.  ESP
   provides rejection of replayed packets for pairwise security
   associations and for multicast security associations under certain
   circumstances[RFC4303].  IPsec ESP for multicast support has the same
   replay mechanism for the single-sender case; however,the multi-sender
   case is for further study.  ESP provides data origin authentication
   for pairwise security associations using symmetric message
   authentication codes, which are not sufficient for group security
   applications where more than two members share a symmetric key.

8.1.  Denial-of-Service Protection

   A group member cannot authenticate the source of the packet for a
   multicast group where multiple members share the MAC key.  Thus, a
   rogue member of the group has all the keying material needed to
   impersonate a sender of the group if that attacker is able to inject
   packets into the network using that sender's IP address.  The
   modified ESP framework addresses this problem by augmenting the IPsec
   ICV with the TESLA MAC protection.  Source authentication schemes
   leave multicast receivers vulnerable to DoS attacks if the receiver
   is duped into performing computationally-expensive validation of
   bogus packets or buffering of bogus packets.  An IPsec ICV is
   REQUIRED to accompany the TESLA MAC so as to limit the effectiveness
   of bogus packets sent by non-group members.

   Unfortunately, group members are still capable of sending packets
   with a valid external-authenticating MAC and invalid TESLA MAC, i.e.,
   any group member can launch a DoS attack.  In this case, the IPsec
   ICV verification will succeed only to have the TESLA MAC verification
   to fail.

   The new transform includes the ESP sequence number in the TESLA MAC
   to protect against a replay attack by a group member.  When the TESLA
   MAC is used, however, the ESP receiver MUST validate both the
   authentication tags before updating the ESP replay window.

8.2.  Encryption

   The value of encryption in the modified ESP transform is to validate
   individual encryption transforms for multicast operation.  It is
   possible that a particular cipher and mode are suitable for pairwise
   security associations but not for multicast security associations,
   such as one where multiple senders share the key.  For example, a
   stream or hybrid stream/block cipher has special risks of keystream
   reuse when its key is shared by multiple senders.  Although IPsec
   encryption transforms are generally suitable for multicast operation,
   many have not been evaluated, tested or used in IP multicast
   environments.  The current version of this document specifies some
   crytographic algorithms that are not safe to use for group
   communication.  Future versions will provide more comprehensive
   guidance.
