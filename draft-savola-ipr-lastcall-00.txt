Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is subject to all provisions
   of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

Abstract

   This memo describes an additional policy with last calls regarding
   Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) claims.  The existence and the
   pointer to the IPR claims or an indication of non-existence of
   knowledge of such claims must be mentioned in all IETF last calls and
   should be mentioned in working group last calls.  Additionally, all
   documents for which a last call prior to the publication was not
   required and IPR claims are known, must now be either last-called or
   rejected.

   This memo updates RFC 2026 and RFC 2418.

1. Introduction

   This memo describes an additional policy with last calls regarding
   Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) claims.

   The existence and the pointer to the IPR claims or an indication of
   non-existence of knowledge of such claims must be mentioned in all
   IETF last calls and should be mentioned in working group last calls.

   Additionally, all documents for which a last call prior to the
   publication was not required and IPR claims are known, must now be
   either last-called or rejected.

   The second section discusses policies regarding working group last
   calls.  The third section in turn describes when and how to IPR
   issues affect IETF last calls; some procedures are common with
   working group last calls, but the mention of IPR claims is required
   rather than strongly encouraged.  The fourth section lists a few
   brief notes on the impact on the process.

   This memo updates RFC 2026 [IETF] and RFC 2418 [WG].

2. Working Group Last Calls

   Working group (WG) last calls are optional [WG], but in practice are
   issued for all Internet-Drafts prior to the submission to the IESG.

   If there is a working group last call, the chair(s) issuing the last
   call should also make a mention whether IPR concerns have been raised
   regarding the document.

   Such a short mention should include at least:

     o the existence of IPR claim(s), and
     o the pointer to all the relevant claim(s) in the IETF IPR
       repository.

   On the other hand, if there no known IPR issues, the fact should be
   clearly mentioned in the last call announcement.

   If IPR claims are known but have not been recorded in the IETF IPR
   repository yet, documents must not be last-called prior to the claims
   appearing in the repository.

   The reason why describing IPR issues in WG last calls is not
   mandatory is due to the assumption that most WG participants can be
   expected to be aware of the IPR claims of the technologies being
   worked on in the working group.  However, everyone may not be fully
   aware of all the IPR in a WG, and IPR claims may have been made only
   recently after a participant has last looked at the IPR repository.
   Thus, it is strongly encouraged to include an IPR notice in all
   working group last calls.

2.1. Examples

   In case there are IPR claims, the portion of the text in the last
   call could be like:

        Relevant IPR has been claimed.  See
        http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/SRI-NGTRANS.txt for details.

   Or if no claims are known, the text in the last call could be like:

        No IPR claims are known.

3. IETF Last Calls

   IETF Last Calls are mandatory for all standards track documents
   [IETF], whether for entering into, advancing within or removing from
   the standards track.

3.1. When to Have an IETF Last Call

   It has not been necessary to last-call Experimental and Informational
   RFC's which are products of a WG.  If such a document has IPR claims,
   an IETF last call must be executed in the similar fashion as with
   standards track documents [IETF].

   It has not been necessary to last-call non-WG Experimental or
   Informational RFC submissions going directly to the RFC Editor.  When
   such a document is passed to the IESG for review, and the document
   has IPR claims, an IETF last call must be executed in similar fashion
   as with standards track documents, or the IESG must propose that the
   RFC Editor not publish the document.

   If the RFC Editor publishes such a document anyway, the IESG must
   insert an appropriate IESG Note in the document, as described in
   [IETF], indicating the presence of IPR claims.

   Note that due to possibly different policies, the existence of IPR
   issues in e.g. IRTF RFC submissions may not be known at all if no IPR
   disclosures are made for such Internet-Drafts.

3.2. The Contents of the IETF Last Call

   Any IETF Last Call must include an indication whether IPR has been
   claimed, and if so, the pointer to the disclosure in the IPR
   repository, as specified with working group last call.

   As with working group last calls, documents which have known IPR
   claims but the claims have not been filed in the IPR repository, a
   last call must not be done prior to the filing.

   The examples, as described above, also apply.  It is recommended that
   some additional information is also provided in the last call, as the
   readers of the IETF last call cannot be expected to know the details
   why the particular solution was chosen despite the IPR claims.

   If a document is being removed from the standards track and is being
   replaced with something else, possible IPR claims with the latter
   should also be described in the similar fashion in the last call.

   The responsibility for filling the IPR parts of an IETF last call is
   with the shepherding Area Director [PROCED], but it is expected that
   in practice it's done by the working group chairs (if applicable) or
   document authors/editors.

4. Process Considerations

   The memo adds only little weight to the process while making the IPR
   claims much more apparent in all the stages of the RFC approval
   process; this should make it easier for people which may be hampered
   by particular types of IPR claims or licensing to comment and debate
   the solutions prior to the approval.

   It is possible that some forms of licensing could be excepted from
   the "IPR claims" category -- but as the terms very from company to
   company and license to license and there has not been any
   harmonization, there cannot be exceptions at the moment.

5. Acknowledgements

   The first proposal was presented in Apr 2003 on the IPR working group
   mailing list; Spencer Dawkins and Brian Carpenter provided support
   and comments.

6. Security Considerations

   The memo makes the IETF RFC approval process of documents with IPR
   claims more transparent; this has no security considerations.
