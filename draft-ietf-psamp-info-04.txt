Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model              March 2006


1.  Open Issues

   This section covers some open issues which have to be solved in a
   future version of this draft.

1.1  IPFIX

   o  The export of sampled data may not need all information elements
      defined by the IPFIX information model.  Thus a section within
      this document should give an overview of flow Information Elements
      defined in the IPFIX information model and their usage in the
      PSAMP environment.  PROPOSAL: This is already covered by section
      6.2 and 6.3 of draft-ietf-psamp-framework-10.txt Double check
      whether it's covered by [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech].
   o  Insert or cross reference the following sections from IPFIX-INFO:
      *  2.  Properties of IPFIX Protocol Information Elements
      *  2.1  Information Elements Specification Template
      *  2.2  Scope of Information Elements
      *  2.3  Naming Conventions for Information Elements
      *  3.  Type Space
      *  4.  Information Element Identifiers
   o  Verify consistency with definitions in
      *  draft-ietf-psamp-sample-tech-07.txt
      *  draft-ietf-psamp-framework-10.txt

1.2  PSAMP

   o  Should the ipHeaderPacketSection and mplsLabelStackSection also
      report payload contents if the specified section length is longer
      than the header or stack size, respectively?

2.  Introduction

   Packet sampling techniques are required for various measurement
   scenarios.  The packet sampling (PSAMP) protocol provides mechanisms
   for the packet selection using different filtering and sampling
   techniques.  A standard way for the export and storage of such
   sampled packet data is required.  The definition of the PSAMP
   information and data model is based on the IP Flow Information eXport
   (IPFIX) protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  The PSAMP protocol
   document [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] describes how to use the IPFIX
   protocol in the PSAMP context.

   This document examines the IPFIX information model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-
   info] and extends it to meet the PSAMP requirements.  Therefore, the
   structure of this document is strongly based on the IPFIX document.
   It complements the PSAMP protocol specification by providing an
   appropriate PSAMP information model.  The main part of this document,



Dietz, et al.         draft-ietf-psamp-info-04.txt              [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model              March 2006


   section 9, defines the list of Information Elements to be transmitted
   by the PSAMP protocol.  Sections 7 and 6 describe the data types and
   Information Element properties used within this document and their
   relationship to the IPFIX information model.

   The main body of section 9 was generated from a XML document.  The
   XML-based specification of the PSAMP Information Elements can be used
   for automatically checking syntactical correctness of the
   specification.  Furthermore it can be used - in combination with the
   IPFIX information model - for an automated code generation.  The
   resulting code can be used in PSAMP protocol implementations to deal
   with processing PSAMP information elements.

   For that reason, the XML document that served as source for section 9
   is attached to this document in Appendix A.

   Note that although partially generated from the attached XML
   documents, the main body of this document is normative while the
   appendices are informational.

3.  PSAMP Documents Overview

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework]: "A Framework for Packet Selection and
   Reporting", describes the PSAMP framework for network elements to
   select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, and to
   export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a collector.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech]: "Sampling and Filtering Techniques for
   IP Packet Selection", describes the set of packet selection
   techniques supported by PSAMP.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol]: "Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Protocol
   Specifications" specifies the export of packet information from a
   PSAMP Exporting Process to a PSAMP Collecting Process.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-info]: "Information Model for Packet Sampling
   Exports" (this document), defines an information and data model for
   PSAMP.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib]: "Definitions of Managed Objects for Packet
   Sampling" describes the PSAMP Management Information Base

4.  Relationship between PSAMP and IPFIX

   As described in the PSAMP protocol draft [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] a
   PSAMP data record can be seen as a very special IPFIX flow record.
   It represents an IPFIX flow containing only a single packet.
   Therefore, the IPFIX information model can be used as a basis for



Dietz, et al.         draft-ietf-psamp-info-04.txt              [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model              March 2006


   PSAMP reports.

   Nevertheless, there are properties required in PSAMP reports which
   cannot be modelled using the current IPFIX information model.  This
   document describes extensions to the IPFIX model which allow the
   modelling of information and data required by PSAMP.

   Some of these extensions allow the export of what may be considered
   sensitive information.  Refer to the Security Considerations section
   for a fuller discussion.

5.  Terminology

   As the IPFIX export protocol is used to export the PSAMP information,
   the relevant IPFIX terminology from [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] is
   copied over in this document.

      Observation Point
      An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP packets
      can be observed.

      Selector
      Observation Domain
      An Observation Domain is the largest set of Observation Points for
      which Flow information can be aggregated by a Metering Process.

      A Selector defines the action of a Selection Process on a single
      packet of its input.

      Primitive Selector
      A Selector is primitive if it is not a Composite Selector.


   EDITORS NOTE: This section to be completed.

6.  Properties of a PSAMP Information Element

   The PSAMP Information Elements are in accordance with the definitions
   of IPFIX.  Therefore we do not repeat the properties in this draft.
   Nevertheless, we strongly recommend to define the optional "unit"
   element for every information element (if applicable).

7.  Type Space

   The PSAMP Information Elements MUST be constructed from the basic
   data types described in the IPFIX Information Model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-
   info].  To avoid duplicated work and to keep consistency between
   IPFIX and PSAMP the data types are not repeated in this document.

8.  Overloading Information Elements

   Information Elements won't be overloaded with multiple meanings or
   re-used for multiple purposes.  Different Information Elements will
   be allocated for each requirement.

   In particular, special information will be encoded in new Information
   Elements as necessary, and not be encoded in the selection method.

   Although the prescence of certain other Information Elements allows
   the selection method to be inferred, a separate Information Element
   is provided for the selectorAlgorithm, e.g. for including in scope
   info and depicting the contents of composites.

9.  The PSAMP Information Elements

   This section describes the Information Elements used by the PSAMP
   exporting functions.  Basically, the Information Elements described
   by the IPFIX information model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] are used by the
   PSAMP export functions where applicable.  To avoid inconsistencies
   between the IPFIX and the PSAMP information and data models, only
   those Information Elements are defined here that are not already
   described by the IPFIX information model.

9.1  PSAMP Usage of IPFIX Attributes

   Some Information Elements defined by the IPFIX information model are
   not needed by the PSAMP protocol.

   This section lists additional Information Elements that are needed in
   the PSAMP context and introduces their usage.

9.2  Additional PSAMP Information Elements

9.2.1  observationPointId

   Description:
      ID of the observation process.  Unique in the observation domain.
   Abstract Data Type: unsigned64
   ElementId: 300
   Status: current

9.2.2  selectionSequenceId

   Description:
      From all the packets observed at an Observation Point, a subset of
      packets is selected by a sequence of one or more Selectors.  The
      selectionSequenceId is a unique value per Observation Domain,
      describing the Observation Point and the sequence of Selectors
      through which the packets are selected.
   Abstract Data Type: unsigned64
   ElementId: 301
   Status: current

9.2.3  selectorId

   Description:
      The Selector ID is the unique ID identifying a Primitive Selector.
      Each Primitive Selector must have a unique ID in the observation
      domain.
   Abstract Data Type: unsigned16
   Data Type Semantics: identifier
   ElementId: 302
   Status: current

9.2.4  informationElementId

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model              March 2006


   Description:
      Contains the ID of another Information Element.
   Abstract Data Type: unsigned16
   Data Type Semantics: identifier
   ElementId: 303
   Status: current

9.2.5  selectorAlgorithm

   Description:
      Specifies the selector algorithm (e.g., filter, sampler, hash)
      that was used on a packet.  It is exported in the options data
      flow record to specify how a collector has to interpret a data
      flow record.

      The following selector algorithms are currently defined:

      *  1 Systematic count-based sampling
      *  2 Systematic time-based sampling
      *  3 Random n-out-of-N sampling
      *  4 Uniform probabilistic sampling
      *  5 Property match filtering
      *  6 Hash based filtering using BOB
      *  7 Hash based filtering using IPSX
      *  8 Hash based filtering using CRC

      EDITOR'S NOTE: This list may be extended in the final version.

      The parameters for most of these algorithms are defined in this
      information model.  Some parameters for these algorithms are not
      covered by this information model since they very much depend on
      the underlying hardware.

      In future, this list will be maintained by IANA.  IANA can update
      this information element as long as there's a new RFC specifying
      the algorithm and any new Information Elements which are required.

      a systematic count-based sampling selector.
   Abstract Data Type: unsigned32
   ElementId: 305
   Status: current
   Units: packets

9.2.7  samplingPacketSpace

   Description:
      The number of packets between two "samplingPacketInterval"s.  A
      value of 100 means that the next interval starts after 100 packets
      (which are not sampled) when the current "samplingPacketInterval"
      is over.

      This information element is used to describe the configuration of
      a systematic count-based sampling selector.

10.  Security Considerations

   The PSAMP information model itself does not directly introduce
   security issues.  Rather it defines a set of attributes which may for
   privacy or business issues be considered sensitive information.

   Specifically, the Information Elements pertaining to packet sections
   MUST target no more than the packet header, some subsequent bytes of
   the packet, and encapsulating headers if present.  Full packet
   capture of arbitrary packet streams is explicitly out of scope, per
   [RFC2804] and the PSAMP WG charter.

   The underlying protocol used to exchange the information described
   here must therefore apply appropriate procedures to guarantee the
   integrity and confidentiality of the exported information.  Such
   protocols are defined in separate documents, specifically the IPFIX
   protocol document [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines an initial set of PSAMP Information Elements as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech], as an extension to the
   IPFIX Information Elements [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  New assignments
   for PSAMP Information Elements will be administered according to



Dietz, et al.         draft-ietf-psamp-info-04.txt             [Page 18]

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model              March 2006


   rules explained in the "IANA Consideration" section of the IPFIX
   Information Model document [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].

   Note that the PSAMP Information Element IDs were initially started at
   the value 300, in order to leave a gap for any ongoing IPFIX work
   requiring new Information Elements.  It is expected that this gap in
   the Information Element numbering will be filled in by IANA with new
   IPFIX Information Elements.

   Appendix B defines an XML schema which may be used to create
   consistent machine readable extensions to the IPFIX information
   model.  This schema introduces a new namespace, which will be
   assigned by IANA according to [RFC3688].

   In future the selectorAlgorithm registry will be maintained by IANA.
   IANA can update this information element as long as there's a new RFC
   specifying the algorithm and any new Information Elements which are
   required.

Appendix A.  Formal Specification of PSAMP Information Elements

   This appendix contains a formal description of the PSAMP information
   model XML document.  Note that this appendix is of informational
   nature, while the text in section Section 9 generated from this
   appendix is normative.

   Using a formal and machine readable syntax for the information model
   enables the creation of PSAMP aware tools which can automatically
   adapt to extensions to the information model, by simply reading
   updated information model specifications.

   The wide availability of XML aware tools and libraries for client
   devices is a primary consideration for this choice.  In particular
   libraries for parsing XML documents are readily available.  Also
   mechanisms such as the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) allow for
   transforming a source XML document into other documents.  This draft
   was authored in XML and transformed according to [RFC2629].

   It should be noted that the use of XML in exporters, collectors or
   other tools is not mandatory for the deployment of PSAMP.  In
   particular, exporting processes do not produce or consume XML as part
   of their operation.  It is expected that PSAMP collectors MAY take
   advantage of the machine readability of the information model vs.
   hardcoding their behavior or inventing proprietary means for
   accommodating extensions.

   Using XML-based specifications does not currently address possible

   IANA implications associated with XML Namespace URIs.  The use of
   Namespaces as an extension mechanism implies that an IANA registered
   Namespace URI should be available and that directory names below this
   base URI be assigned for relevant IETF specifications.  The authors
   are not aware of this mechanism today.
