2.  Abstract

The  Point-to-Point  Protocol  (PPP)  [1] provides a standard method for
transporting multi-protocol datagrams over  point-to-point  links.   PPP
also  defines  an  extensible  Link Control Protocol (LCP), which allows
negotiation of an Authentication Protocol for  authenticating  its  peer
before allowing Network Layer protocols to transmit over the link.

Both  Link Control Protocol and Authentication Protocol packets may con-
tain text which is intended to be human-readable [2, 3, 4].  This  docu-
ment  defines LCP configuration options for the negotiation of character
set and language usage, as required by RFC 2277 [5].

INTERNET-DRAFT      LCP Internationalization Options         March 1998


3.  Specification of Requirements

In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST,  "MUST  NOT",  "optional",
"recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT"  are  to be interpreted as
described in [5].


4.  Additional LCP Configuration Options

The Configuration Option format and basic options  are  already  defined
for LCP [1].

Up-to-date  values  of  the LCP Option Type field are specified in STD 2
[7].  This document concerns the following values:

   ??  Language-Tag
   ??  Charset-Name

Both of the options described here MAY be  negotiated  independently  in
each direction.

Only  one instance of either option SHOULD be sent by an implementation,
representing its preferred language or charset.

If either the Langage-Tag or the Charset-Name option is rejected by  the
peer, the appropriate default language or charset MUST be used.

Peers SHOULD NOT NAK either of these options; if either option is NAK'd,
the peer SHOULD reject the option.


4.1.  Language-Tag

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a method for an  implementation
      to  indicate to the peer the language in which human-readable mes-
      sages it sends should be composed.

   A summary of the Language-Tag Option  format  is  shown  below.   The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3

   Type

      ??


   Length

      >= 3


   Tag

      The Tag field is an ASCII string which contains a language tag, as
      defined in RFC 1766 [8].  The default  Tag  value  is  "i-default"
      [8].


4.2.  Charset-Name

Description

   This  Configuration Option provides a method for an implementation to
   indicate to the peer the charset in which human-readable messages  it
   sends should be represented.

A  summary of the Charset-Name Option format is shown below.  The fields
are transmitted from left to right.

 0                   1                   2
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     Type      |    Length     |    Name...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


Type

   ??


Length

   >= 3


Tag

   The Name field is an ASCII string  which  contains  a  charset  name.

   This  name  MUST  be  one  of  the set of charsets listed in the IANA
   charset registry [7].

   The charset registration procedure is described in RFC 2278 [9].

   The default charset value is UTF-8 [10].


5.  Security Considerations

It is possible that an attacker might manipulate the options in  such  a
way that displayable messages would be unintelligible to the reader.
