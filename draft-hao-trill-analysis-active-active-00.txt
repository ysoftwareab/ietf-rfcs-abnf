1. Introduction

   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   [RFC6325] protocol provides loop free and per hop based multipath
   data forwarding with minimum configuration. TRILL uses IS-IS
   [RFC6165] [RFC6326bis] as its control plane routing protocol and
   defines a TRILL specific header for user data.

   Customer edge(CE) devices typically are multi-homed to several
   RBridges. All of the uplinks of CE is considered as an Multi-Chassis
   Link Aggregation (MC-LAG) bundle. An edge group is the group of edge
   RBridges that a CE is multi-homed to in active-active mode. An edge
   group corresponds to a MC-LAG. One RB can be in more than one edge
   group. An active-active flow-based load-sharing mechanism is
   implemented to achieve better load balancing and high reliability. A
   CE device can be a layer3 end system by itself or a bridge switch
   through which layer3 end systems are accessed to TRILL campus.

   summary on the pros and cons, and/or the applicable scenarios. The
   co-authors believe such analysis is helpful to design a more
   completed solution in future.

2. Conventions used in this document

   CE - Customer equipment. Could be a bridge or end station or a
   hypervisor.

   CMT - Coordinated Multicast Trees.

   Edge group - a group of edge RBs to which at least one CE is
   multiply attached. One RB can be in more than one edge group.

   LACP - Link Aggregation Control Protocol.

   LAG - Link Aggregation, as specified in [8021AX].

3. Frame duplications

   Frame duplication may occur when a remote host sends multi-
   destination frame to a local CE which has active-active connection
   to the TRILL campus.

   To avoid local CE receives multiple copies from remote RBridge,
   designated forwarder(DF) mechanism should be supported, which allow
   only one port in one RB of MC-LAG to forward traffic from TRILL
   campus to local access side for each layer2 virtual network. The
   basic idea of DF is to elect one RBridge per VLAN from an edge group
   to be responsible for egressing the multicast traffic. [draft-hao-
   trill-dup-avoidance-active-active-00] describes the detail DF
   mechanism and TRILL protocol extension for DF election.

4. Loop

   If a CE sends a broadcast, unknown unicast, or multicast (BUM)
   packet to DF RB, it will forward that packet to all or subset of the
   other RBs including the non-DF RBs. Because non-DF RBs don't egress
   BUM frame to local access side, in this case the frame won't loop
   back to the CE.

   If a CE sends a BUM packet to one of the non-DF (Designated
   Forwarder) RBs, say RB1, then RB1 will forward that packet to all or
   subset of the other RBs including the DF RB for that MC-LAG. In this
   case the frame will loop back to the CE and traffic split-horizon
   filtering mechanism should be used to avoid looping back among
   RBridges in a edge group.

   Split-horizon mechanism relies on ingress nickname to check if a
   packet's egress port belongs to a same MC-LAG with the packet's
   incoming port to TRILL campus.

4.1. Independent nickname allocation

   Each ingress RBridge allocates a unique nickname for each MC-LAG
   independently. It is not required that the nickname provisioned on
   all involving edge RBridges remains the same for one corresponding
   MC-LAG.

   When the ingress RBridge receives a BUM frame from a local CE, it
   uses the nickname as ingress nickname for TRILL tunnel encapsulation
   and sends the frame to other RBridge(s).

   When an egress RBridge receives the multicast frame from TRILL
   network, it checks the ingress nickname in TRILL header and filters
   out the frame on all local interfaces connected to the same CE. Each
   egress RBridge should track the nickname(s) associated with the
   other RBridge(s) with which it has shared multi-homed LAG. The
   solution has limited nickname allocation scalability issue, because
   each RBridge needs allocate per nickname per MC-LAG.

4.2. Consistent nickname allocation

   Edge RBridges forming an MC-LAG in an edge group are assigned a
   globally unique pseudo-nickname. If multiple MC-LAGs exist, edge
   BRridges for each individual MC-LAG should be assigned such a
   pseudo-nickname. It should be guaranteed that pseudo-nickname
   provisioned on all involving edge RBridges remains the same for one
   corresponding MC-LAG.

   When a ingress RBridge receives traffic from a active-active
   accessed CE, it performs TRILL encapsulation with the pseudo-
   nickname as ingress nickname. When the traffic comes to each egress
   RBridge, the egress RBridge checks the ingress nickname in TRILL
   header and filters out the frame on all local interfaces connected
   to the same CE. Each egress RBridge relies on the pseudo-nickname to
   filter out the frame on all local interfaces connected to the same
   CE.

5. Address flip-flop

   MAC learning in TRILL can be performed either in data plane or
   control plane. When a local host h1 attaches to multiple edge
   RBridges, learning at the remote host for h1 may have MAC flip-flop
   problem. There are different ways to avoid this for data plane
   learning and control plane learning scenarios.

5.1. Data plane learning mode

   For data plane learning mode, to avoid mac address flip-flop on
   remote RBs, a pseudo-nickname [TRILLPN] solution was proposed. The
   basic idea is to represent all member links of the MC-LAG as a
   virtual RBridge with single pseudo-nickname. Any member RBridge of
   the MC-LAG should use this pseudo-nickname rather than its own
   nickname as ingress nickname when inject TRILL data frames. It
   solves the abovementioned problems pretty well; however, it
   introduces another issue: packet drop due to RPF check. To overcome
   the RPF check failure issue, three solutions have been proposed.

5.1.1. CMT

   CMT [CMT] solution allows edge RBridges to specify different
   distribution trees to forward BUM traffic from a connecting CE
   device by using a new IS-IS Affinity sub-TLV. Remote RBridges
   calculate their forwarding tables and derive the RPF for
   distribution trees based on the distribution tree association
   advertisements.

   In this solution, it's required to establish multiple distribution
   trees in a TRILL campus, i.e. if a CE is active-active accessed to 4
   edge RBridges, at least 4 distribution trees is required. No
   hardware upgrade is needed for all RBridges in the TRILL campus,
   only software upgrade is needed.

Internet-Draft  Analysis of Active-Active connection     February 2014


5.1.2. Centralized replication

   Ingress RB participating active-active connection sends BUM traffic
   to one of a distribution tree root node through unicast TRILL
   encapsulation. The distribution tree root node acts as centralized
   replication node. When the distribution tree root node receives
   unicast TRILL encapsulation BUM traffic from the ingress RB, it
   decapsulates the unicast TRILL packet. Then it replicates and
   forwards the BUM traffic to all other destination RBs through the
   distribution tree established per TRILL base protocol. [draft-hao-
   trill-centralized-replication-00] describes the detail centralized
   replication solution. Through the centralized replication solution,
   only unicast forwarding behavior is required between edge RB and
   distribution tree root RB, so no RPF check function is required
   along the path between ingress RB and distribution tree node.

   When the ingress RBridge receives BUM traffic from an active-active
   accessing CE device, the traffic will be injected to TRILL campus
   through TRILL encapsulation. Then it is replicated and forwarded to
   other CE devices through TRILL distribution tree, even when the
   receiver CE is connected to the same RBridge as the sender CE. To
   avoid duplicated traffic on receiver CE, ingress RBridge can't local
   replicate and forward the BUM traffic to other connecting CE when it
   receives BUM traffic from an active-active sender CE, i.e. the
   access port of the ingress RBridge should be isolated from other
   local access ports.

   In this solution, it's required to consume more network bandwidth
   between ingress RB and distribution tree root node than CMT solution.
   Both hardware and software upgrade are required on edge RBs
   participating active-active connection and distribution tree root
   node. This solution doesn't require multiple distribution trees in
   TRILL campus, so it has better scalability than CMT.

5.1.3. Tunneling among edge RBs

   This solution allows only a selected edge RBridge in a virtual
   RBridge participating active-active access to be responsible for
   forwarding BUM traffic from connecting CE to TRILL campus along
   distribution tree per TRILL base protocol. All other edge RBridges
   in the virtual RBridge sends BUM traffic from connecting CE to the
   selected edge RBridge through unicast TRILL encapsulation. When the
   selected edge RBridge receives TRILL traffic from other RBs in a
   same virtual RBridge, the selected RB decapsulates the unicast TRILL
   packet. Then it forwards the BUM traffic to trill campus along
   distribution tree established per TRILL protocol.

Internet-Draft  Analysis of Active-Active connection     February 2014


   Similar to the solution of centralized replication, to avoid
   duplicated traffic on receiver CE, the access port of ingress
   RBridge connecting to an active-active accessing sender CE should be
   isolated from other local access ports.

   In this solution, it's required to consume more network bandwidth
   among edge RBs. Both hardware and software upgrade are required on
   edge RBs participating active-active connection. This solution
   doesn't require multiple distribution trees in TRILL campus, so it
   has better scalability than CMT.

   +----------------------+---------+--------------------------+----------------------------+
5.2. Control plane learning mode

   If a CE device is multi-homed to multiple edge RBs in active-active
   mode, each edge RB should announce the MAC of its attached end
   systems to all other RBs through ESADI-like control protocol. Remote
   RBriges will learn the MAC association with different ingress RB
   nicknames and generate multiple MAC forwarding entries in ECMP mode.
   All edge RBs should disable the data plane MAC learning function.
   MAC to nickname association should be learned only through the
   control plane.

   Pseudo-nickname mechanism was basically designed to avoid MAC
   address learning flip-flop when a MAC address could be learnt to
   more than one RBridge. With control plane MAC leaning, pseudo-
   nickname is not required since multiple mac to nickname entries can
   be leaned for the same MAC. The problem of RPF check failure for
   multicast frame caused by pseudo-nickname mechanism is not an issue
   here.

   In the control plane MAC learning solution, if an edge RB
   participating TRILL active-active access receives BUM traffic from
   connecting CE device, it uses its own nickname as ingress nickname
   instead of pseudo-nickname to ingress data frame into a TRILL campus.

6. Unsynchronized information among member RBridges

   Synchronization mechanism should be provided to ensure information
   consistency among all edge RBridges in a edge group, such as MAC
   table, dynamic VLAN and multicast group, LACP configuration and
   state, DHCP snooping table, and etc. [draft-hao-trill-rb-syn-02]
   describes the detail synchronization requirements. Two
   synchronization solutions as follows are provided.

6.1. RBridge channel based communication protocol

   RBridge channel based communication protocol among all RBridges in a
   edge group is introduced to implement synchronization. The
   communication protocol is restricted to RBridge nodes in each edge
   group, other RBridges in TRILL campus needn't involve. A new type of
   RBridge Channel message should be given by a Protocol field in the
   RBridge Channel Header to indicate synchronization information in
   the payload. RBridge channel message is forwarded through TRILL data
   plane. Transmission delay is relatively low.

6.2. TRILL LSP extension

   TRILL LSP can be extended to implement synchronization among all
   edge RBridges. Synchronization information are conveyed through new
   TLVs or sub-TLVs in TRILL LSP. Because TRILL LSP is flooded to all
   RBridges in TRILL campus, so it may cause campus wide fluctuation.
   TRILL LSP is forwarded through control plane. Transmission delay is
   relatively high.

7. Solution summary

   Through the above analysis, a completed solution for active-active
   connection can be stitched by mechanisms for each individual problem
   analyzed in this draft.

   If there are multiple mechanisms for a single problem, any one can
   be picked up. For example, in MAC learning through data plane
   scenarios for address flip-flop problem, there are three mechanisms
   including CMT, centralized replication and tunneling among edge RBs
   to solve MAC address flip-flop problems. Any one out of three can be
   selected to combine with other mechanisms to form a whole solution.
   If there is only one mechanism for a single problem, then it is a
   mandatory part of the completed solution. For example, DF election
   mechanism is the only acceptable way to prevent frame duplication.
   Thus it is a mandatory part of the completed solution.

   In summary, the whole solution for TRILL active-active connection is
   as follows.
