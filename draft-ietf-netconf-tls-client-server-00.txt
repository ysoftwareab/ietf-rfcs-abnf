Abstract

   This document defines two YANG modules, one defines groupings for a
   generic TLS client and the other defines groupings for a generic TLS
   server.  It is intended that these groupings will be used by
   applications using the TLS protocol.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG [RFC6020] modules, one defines
   groupings for a generic TLS client and the other defines groupings
   for a generic TLS server (TLS is defined in [RFC5246]).  It is
   intended that these groupings will be used by applications using the
   TLS protocol.  For instance, these groupings could be used to help
   define the data model for an HTTPS [RFC2818] server or a NETCONF over
   TLS [RFC7589] based server.

   The two YANG modules in this document each define two groupings.  One
   grouping defines everything other than what's needed for the TCP
   [RFC793] protocol layer.  The other grouping uses the first grouping
   while adding TCP layer specifics (e.g., addresses to connect to,
   ports to listen on, etc.).  This separation is done in order to
   enable applications the opportunity to define their own strategy for
   how the underlying TCP connection is established.  For instance,
   applications supporting NETCONF Call Home
   [draft-ietf-netconf-call-home] could use the first grouping for the
   TLS parts it provides, while adding data nodes for the reversed TCP
   layer.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data models is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

Internet-Draft        TLS Client and Server Models             July 2016


   o  Braces "{" and "}" enclose feature names, and indicate that the
      named feature must be present for the subtree to be present.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  The TLS Client Model

   EDITOR NOTE: Please ignore this section, it is incomplete.

   The TLS client model presented in this section contains two YANG
   groupings, one for a client that initiates the underlying TCP
   connection and another for a client that has had the TCP connection
   opened for it already (e.g., call home).

   Both of these groupings reference data nodes defined by the System
   Keychain model [draft-ietf-netconf-system-keychain].  For instance, a
   reference to the keychain model is made to indicate which trusted CA
   certificate a client should use to authenticate the server's
   certificate.

2.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram presents the data model for the two
   groupings defined in the ietf-tls-client module.

   module: ietf-tls-client
   groupings:
     initiating-tls-client-grouping
        +---- some-TBD-tcp-client-stuff?   string
        +---- some-TBD-tls-client-stuff?   string

     non-initiating-tls-client-grouping
        +---- some-TBD-tls-client-stuff?   string

2.2.  Example Usage

   This section shows how it would appear if the initiating-tls-client-
   grouping were populated with some data.  This example is consistent
   with the examples presented in Section 2.2 of
   [draft-ietf-netconf-system-keychain].

3.  The TLS Server Model

   The TLS server model presented in this section contains two YANG
   groupings, one for a server that opens a socket to accept TCP
   connections and another for a server that has had the TCP connection
   opened for it already (e.g., inetd).

   Both of these groupings reference data nodes defined by the System
   Keychain model [draft-ietf-netconf-system-keychain].  For instance, a
   reference to the keychain model is made to indicate the certificate a
   server should present.

   groupings defined in the ietf-tls-server module.
