                 Clarifying RPKI use of CMS SignerInfo
                     draft-michaelson-signerinfo-00

Abstract

   RFC6485 section 2 mandated a single CMS OID sha256withRSAEncryption
   from RFC4055 for use in the CMS SignerInfo field.  This draft updates
   RFC6485 and extends it to permit the correct CMS use which includes
   an option of rsaEncryption for the SignerInfo field.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6485 [RFC6485] defines The Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes
   for Use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  In that
   document, Section 2 specifies a single signature algorithm (SHA-246)
   and a single CMS OID, sha256withRSAEncryption, to be used for the
   SignerInfo field of the CMS object.

   A closer reading of the relevant RFCs RFC 4055 [RFC4055] and RFC 5754
   [RFC5754] identified that the CMS SignerInfo field must support use
   of the rsaEncryption OID for full conformance with the CMS
   specifications, and the normative references in RFC 6485 inherit this
   requirement.

   To ensure conformance with the CMS specifications, RFC 6485 is
   updated by this draft.  All of RFC 6485 applies except for a change
   to the SignerInfo field.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In RFC 6485, Section 2 the following sentence:

      The Object Identifier (OID) sha256withRSAEncryption from [RFC4055]
      MUST be used.

   is replaced by:

      One of the Object Identifiers (OID) rsaEncryption or
      sha256WithRSAEncryption from [RFC4055] MUST be used.  RPKI
      implementations MUST support rsaEncryption for the
      signatureAlgorithm field and SHOULD support
      sha256WithRSAEncryption.

3.  Acknowledgements

   This draft reflects a discussion between Rob Austein and Matt
   Lepinski on the SIDR Working group mailing list and a private
   communication between Rob Austein and Geoff Huston.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   By conforming more closely to the CMS specifications, RPKI CMS
   objects are less likely to be rejected as non-conformant with the
   standards.  No change is made to the cryptographic status of the CMS
   objects produced.
