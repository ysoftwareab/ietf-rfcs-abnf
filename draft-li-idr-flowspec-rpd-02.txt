1.  Introduction

   Some difficulties exist when optimize traffic paths on a traditional
   IP network:

   o  Traffic can only be adjusted device by device.  All routers that
      the traffic traverses need to be configured.  The configuration
      workload is heavy.  The operation is not only time consuming but
      also prone to misconfiguration for Service Providers.

   o  The routing policies used to control network routes are complex,
      posing difficulties to subsequent maintenance, high maintenance
      skills are required.

   Hence, an automatic mechanism for setting up routing policies is
   desirable which can simplify the complexity of routing policies
   configuration.  This document describes a mechanism to use BGP
   Flowspec address family [RFC5575] as route-policy distribution
   protocol.  This mechanism is called BGP FlowSpec Extensions for
   Routing Policy Distribution (BGP-FS RPD).

2.  Definitions and Acronyms

   BGP Flow Specification route: BGP Flow Specification routes are
   defined in RFC 5575.  Each BGP Flow Specification route contains BGP
   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and Extended Community
   Attributes, which carry traffic filtering rules and actions to be
   taken on filtered traffic.

   BGP Flow Specification peer relationship: A BGP Flow Specification
   peer relationship is established between the device that generates
   BGP Flow Specification routes and each network ingress that will
   transmit the BGP Flow Specification routes.  After receiving the BGP
   Flow Specification routes, the peer delivers preferred BGP Flow
   Specification routes to the forwarding plane.  The routes are then
   converted into traffic policies that control attack traffic.

   o  BGP: Border Gateway Protocol

   o  FS: Flow Specification

   o  PBR:Policy-Based Routing

   o  RPD: Routing Policy Distribution

3.  Problem Statements

   It is obvious that providers have the requirements to adjust their
   business traffic from time to time because:

   o  Business development or network failure introduces link congestion
      and overload.

   o  Network transmission quality decreased as the result of delay,
      loss and need to adjust traffic to other paths.

   o  To control OPEX and CPEX, prefer the transit provider with lower
      price.

3.1.  Inbound Traffic Control

   In the scenario below, for reasons above, the provider of AS100
   saying P may wish the inbound traffic from AS200 enters AS100 through
   link L3 instead of others.  Since P doesn't have administration over
   AS200, so there is no way for P to modify the route selection
   criteria directly.

3.2.  Outbound Traffic Control

   In this scenario, the provider of AS100 saying P wishes to prefer
   link L3 for the traffic to the destination Prefix2 among multiple
   exits and links.  This preference can be dynamic and change
   frequently because of the reasons above.  So the provider P expects
   an efficient and convenient solution.

4.  Proposed Solution

   BGP FlowSpec [RFC5575] leverages the BGP control plane to simplify
   the distribution of filter rules.  New filter rules can be injected
   to all BGP peers simultaneously without changing router
   configuration.  Though the typical application of it is for DDOS
   mitigation, it doesn't mean BGP Flowspec only takes effect on the
   forwarding plane.

   This document introduces a mechanism that uses BGP Flowspec as a
   route-policy distribution protocol.  It can be the same powerful as
   the device-based route-policy while still has the efficiency and
   convenience of BGP Flowspec.

   This draft will use the term BGP-FS RPD as the abbreviation of
   FlowSpec Extensions for Routing Policy Distribution.

5.  Protocol Extensions

5.1.  FlowSpec Traffic Actions for Routing Policy Distribution

   The traffic-action extended community consists of 6 bytes of which
   only the 2 least significant bits of the 6th byte (from left to
   right) are currently defined in [RFC5575].  Terminal Action (bit 47)
   and Sample (bit 46) defines in [RFC5575], this document defines Route
   Policy Distribution Flag(Bit 45).

   The Flow Specification Traffic Actions for Routing Policy
   Distribution:

                       40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     | reserved          | R | S | T |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     Figure 3: FlowSpec Traffic-action

   Route Policy Distribution Flag(Bit 45): When this bit is set, the
   corresponding filtering rules will be used as Route Policy.

5.2.  Option 1: BGP Policy Attribute

   This document defines and uses a new BGP attribute called the "BGP
   Policy attribute".  This is an optional BGP attribute.  The format of
   this attribute is defined as follows:

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |                               |
                     |   Match fields (Variable)     |
                     |                               |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |                               |
                     |   Action fields (Variable)    |
                     |                               |

   Match fields: Match Fields define the matching criteria for the BGP
   Policy Attribute.

   Action fields: Action fields define the action being applied to the

5.2.1.  Match Fields Format

   Match Fields define the matching criteria for the BGP Policy
   Attribute.

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |   Match Type (2 octets)       |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     | Number of Sub-TLVs (2 octets) |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |                               |
                     |   Sub-TLVs (Variable)         |
                     |                               |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                    Figure 5: Match Fields Format

   Match Type:

   0: Permit, specifies the permit mode of a match rule.  If a route
   matches the matching criteria of the BGP Policy Attribute, the
   actions defined by the Action fields of the BGP Policy Attribute are
   performed.  If a route does not match the matching criteria for the
   BGP Policy Attribute, then nothing needs to do with this route.

   1: Deny, specifies the deny mode of a match rule.  In the deny mode,
   If a route does not match the matching criteria of the BGP Policy
   Attribute, the actions defined by the Action fields of the BGP Policy
   Attribute are performed.  If a route matches the matching criteria of
   the BGP Policy Attribute, then nothing needs to do with this route.

   Number of Sub-TLVs: The number of Sub-TLVs contain in Match fields.

   The contents of Match fields are encoded as Sub-TLVs, where each TLV
   has the following format:

                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |       Type (2 octets)         |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |       Length (2 octets)       |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |                               |
                     |       Values (Variable)       |
                     |                               |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     Figure 6: Sub-TLVs Format

   Type: The Type field contains a value of 1-65534.  The values 0 and
   65535 are reserved for future use.

5.2.3.  Operation Examples

5.2.3.1.  Inbound Traffic Control

   The traffic destined for Prefix1 needs to be scheduled to link
   Speaker1 -> IGW2 for transmission.

   The Policy Controller constructs a BGP-FS RPD route and pushes it to
   all the IGW routers, the route carries:

   1.  Prefix1 in the Destination Prefix component of the BGP-FS NLRI;

   2.  Flow Specification Traffic Action Extended Community with the
       Route Policy Distribution Flag(Bit 45) set.  When this bit is
       set, the corresponding filtering rules will be used as Routing
       Policies.

   3.  NO_ADVERTISE Community [RFC1997]

   4.  BGP Policy Attribute:

       *  Match Type: 2, Deny

       *  IPv4 Neighbor Sub-TLV: Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP Peer
          Speaker1

       *  Action Type: Route-Prepend-AS

       *  Action Value: Prepend-AS times is 5

   IGW1 processes the received BGP-FS RPD route as follows:

   1.  IGW1 gets the target prefix Prefix1 from the Destination Prefix
       component in the BGP FS NLRI of the BGP FS RPD route;

   2.  IGW1 identifies the Route Policy Distribution Flag carrying in
       the Flow Specification Traffic Action Extended Community, then
       IGW1 knows that the corresponding filtering rules will be used as
       Routing Policies.

   3.  IGW1 uses the target prefix Prefix1 to choose the matching
       routes, in this case, IGW1 will choose the current best route of
       Prefix1;

   4.  IGW1 gets the matching criteria from the BGP Policy Attribute:
       Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP Speaker1;

Internet-Draft                 BGP FS RPD                      June 2016


   5.  IGW1 gets the action from the BGP Policy Attribute: Route-
       Prepend-AS, 5 times;

   IGW1 checks the matching criteria and finds that it doesn't hits the
   matching criteria: Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP Speaker1, at
   the same time the Match Type is "Deny" mode, so IGW1 sends the best
   route of Prefix1 to Speaker1 and Speaker2 with performing the Action
   instructions from the BGP-FS RPD route: Prepend Local AS 5 times.

   IGW2 processes the received BGP FS RPD route as follows:

   1.  IGW2 gets the target prefix Prefix1 from the Destination Prefix
       component in the BGP-FS NLRI of the BGP FS RPD route;

   2.  IGW2 identifies the Route Policy Distribution Flag carrying in
       the Flow Specification Traffic Action Extended Community, then
       IGW2 knows that the corresponding filtering rules will be used as
       Routing Policies.

   3.  IGW2 uses the target prefix Prefix1 to choose the matching
       routes, in this case, IGW2 will choose the current best route of
       Prefix1;

   4.  IGW2 gets the matching criteria from the BGP Policy Attribute:
       Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP Speaker1;

   5.  IGW2 gets the action from the BGP Policy Attribute: Route-
       Prepend-AS, 5 times;

   IGW2 checks the matching criteria and finds that there is a speaker
   which hits the matching criteria: Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP
   Peer Speaker1, but the Match Type is "Deny" mode, so IGW2 sends the
   best route of Prefix1 to Speaker1, without performing the Action
   instructions from the BGP-FS RPD route.  At the same time, IGW2 sends
   the best route of Prefix1 to Speaker2 with performing the Action
   instructions from the BGP-FS RPD route: Prepend Local AS 5 times.

   In the similar manner, other IGWs will perform the same Action
   instructions as IGW1.  Then the traffic destined for Prefix1 has been
   be scheduled to link L3 for transmission.

5.2.3.2.  Outbound Traffic Control

   In this scenario, if the bandwidth usage of a link exceeds the
   specified threshold, the Policy Controller automatically identifies
   which traffic needs to be scheduled and the Policy Controller
   automatically calculates traffic control paths based on network
   topology and traffic information.

   For example, the outbound traffic destined for Prefix2 needs to be
   scheduled to link IGW2 -> Speaker1 for transmission.

   The Policy Controller sends a BGP-FS RPD route to IGW2, the route
   carries:

   1.  Prefix2 in the Destination Prefix component of the BGP-FS NLRI;

   2.  Flow Specification Traffic Action Extended Community with the
       Route Policy Distribution Flag(Bit 45) set.  When this bit is
       set, the corresponding filtering rules will be used as Routing
       Policies.

   3.  NO_ADVERTISE Community [RFC1997]

   4.  BGP Policy Attribute:

       *  Match Type: 1, Permit

       *  IPv4 Neighbor Sub-TLV: Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP Peer
          Speaker1

       *  Action Type: Route-Preference

       *  Action Value: none

   IGW2 processes the received BGP FS RPD route as follows:

   1.  IGW2 gets the target prefix Prefix2 from the Destination Prefix
       component in the BGP-FS NLRI of the BGP FS RPD route;

   2.  IGW2 identifies the Route Policy Distribution Flag carrying in
       the Flow Specification Traffic Action Extended Community, then
       IGW2 knows that the corresponding filtering rules will be used as
       Routing Policies.

   3.  IGW2 uses the target prefix Prefix2 to choose the matching
       routes, in this case, the prefix Prefix2 has two more routes:

         Prefix    Next-Hop   Local BGP Speaker   Remote BGP Peer
         Prefix2   Speaker1         IGW2                Speaker1
         Prefix2   Speaker2         IGW2                Speaker2
         ...


   4.  IGW2 gets the matching criteria from the BGP Policy Attribute:
       Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP Peer Speaker1;

Internet-Draft                 BGP FS RPD                      June 2016


   5.  IGW2 gets the action from the BGP Policy Attribute: Route-
       Preference;

   So IGW2 chooses the BGP route received from Speaker1 instead of
   Speaker2 as the best route and the outbound traffic destined for
   Prefix2 can be scheduled to link L3 for transmission.

5.3.  Option 2: BGP Wide Community

   This section describes the option 2 for protocol extensions, which is
   completely different from section 5.2 by reusing BGP Wide Community
   introduced in [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities].

   BGP Wide Community Attribute is a very useful tool that it can be
   used to convey different kinds of routing policies.

5.3.1.  New Wide Community Atoms

   Wide Community Atoms define in [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities] ,
   in that draft it defines Type 1 to Type 8.

   New wide community atoms have to be introduced since the entrance and
   exit of traffic need to be designated precisely.

5.3.2.  Operation examples

5.3.2.1.  Inbound Traffic Control

   As required in the case, traffic from PE1 to Prefix1 need to enter
   through L3, so IGWs except IGW2 should prepend ASN list to Prefix1
   when populating to AS100.  As shown in figure below, community
   "PREPEND N TIMES BY AS" and "Exclude Target(s) TLV" are be used.

   Where "BGP IPv4 neighbor" Atom TLV contains:
   The BGP session IPv4 local address: Local BGP Speaker IGW2
   The BGP session IPv4 peer address: Remote BGP Peer Speaker1

   IGW1 processes the received BGP-FS RPD route as follows:

   1.  IGW1 gets the target prefix Prefix1 from the Destination Prefix
       component in the BGP FS NLRI of the BGP FS RPD route;

   2.  IGW1 identifies the Route Policy Distribution Flag carrying in
       the Flow Specification Traffic Action Extended Community, then
       IGW1 knows that the corresponding filtering rules will be used as
       Routing Policies.

   3.  IGW1 uses the target prefix Prefix1 to choose the matching
       routes, in this case, IGW1 will choose the current best route of
       Prefix1;

   4.  IGW1 gets the action type from the Wide BGP Community Attribute:
       PREPEND N TIMES BY AS;

   5.  IGW1 gets the matching criteria from the Wide BGP Community

   IGW2 checks the matching criteria and finds that there is a speaker
   which hits the exclude matching criteria: Local BGP Speaker IGW2,
   Remote BGP Peer Speaker1, so IGW2 sends the best route of Prefix1 to
   Speaker1 without performing the Action instructions from the BGP-FS

   4.  Wide BGP Community Attribute:

   LOCAL PREFERENCE:
          Type: 0x0001                S = src AS #
          F = 0x80                    C = 0x00000000
          H = 0                       T = Type_TBD (BGP IPv4 neighbor)
          L = 36 octets               E = none
          R = 20                      P = Type_4 (0x64)

   Where "BGP IPv4 neighbor" Atom TLV contains:
   The BGP session IPv4 local address: Local BGP Speaker IGW2
   The BGP session IPv4 peer address: Remote BGP Peer Speaker1

   IGW2 processes the received BGP FS RPD route as follows:

   1.  IGW2 gets the target prefix Prefix2 from the Destination Prefix
       component in the BGP-FS NLRI of the BGP FS RPD route;

   2.  IGW2 identifies the Route Policy Distribution Flag carrying in
       the Flow Specification Traffic Action Extended Community, then
       IGW2 knows that the corresponding filtering rules will be used as
       Routing Policies.

   3.  IGW2 uses the target prefix Prefix2 to choose the matching
       routes, in this case, the prefix Prefix2 has two more routes:

         Prefix    Next-Hop   Local BGP Speaker   Remote BGP Peer
         --------------------------------------------------------
         Prefix2   Speaker1         IGW2                Speaker1
         Prefix2   Speaker2         IGW2                Speaker2
         ...


   4.  IGW2 gets the action type from the Wide BGP Community Attribute:
       LOCAL PREFERENCE;

   5.  IGW2 gets the matching criteria from the Wide BGP Community
       Attribute: Local BGP Speaker IGW2, Remote BGP Peer Speaker1;

   6.  IGW2 gets the parameter for "LOCAL PREFERENCE" from the Wide BGP
       Community Attribute: increment 100;

   So IGW2 chooses the BGP route received from Speaker1 instead of
   Speaker2 as the best route and the outbound traffic destined for
   Prefix2 can be scheduled to link L3 for transmission.

5.4.  Capability Negotiation

   It is necessary to negotiate the capability to support BGP FlowSpec
   Extensions for Route Policy Distribution (RPD).  The BGP FS RPD
   Capability is a new BGP capability [RFC5492].  The Capability Code
   for this capability is to be specified by the IANA.  The Capability
   Length field of this capability is variable.  The Capability Value
   field consists of one or more of the following tuples:

           +--------------------------------------------------+
           |  Address Family Identifier (2 octets)            |
           +--------------------------------------------------+
           |  Subsequent Address Family Identifier (1 octet)  |
           +--------------------------------------------------+
           |  Send/Receive (1 octet)                          |
           +--------------------------------------------------+
           Figure 11: BGP FS RPD Capability

   The meaning and use of the fields are as follows:

   Address Family Identifier (AFI): This field is the same as the one
   used in [RFC4760].

   Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI): This field is the same
   as the one used in [RFC4760].

   Send/Receive: This field indicates whether the sender is (a) willing
   to receive Route Policies via BGP FLowSpec from its peer (value 1),
   (b) would like to send Route Policies via BGP FLowSpec to its peer
   (value 2), or (c) both (value 3) for the <AFI, SAFI>.

6.  Consideration

6.1.  Route-Policy

   Routing policies are used to filter routes and control how routes are
   received and advertised.  If route attributes, such as reachability,
   are changed, the path along which network traffic passes changes
   accordingly.

   When advertising, receiving, and importing routes, the router
   implements certain policies based on actual networking requirements
   to filter routes and change the attributes of the routes.  Routing
   policies serve the following purposes:

   o  Control route advertising: Only routes that match the rules
      specified in a policy are advertised.

   o  Control route receiving: Only the required and valid routes are
      received.  This reduces the size of the routing table and improves
      network security.

   o  Filter and control imported routes: A routing protocol may import
      routes discovered by other routing protocols.  Only routes that
      satisfy certain conditions are imported to meet the requirements
      of the protocol.

   o  Modify attributes of specified routes Attributes of the routes:
      that are filtered by a routing policy are modified to meet the
      requirements of the local device.

   o  Configure fast reroute (FRR): If a backup next hop and a backup
      outbound interface are configured for the routes that match a
      routing policy, IP FRR, VPN FRR, and IP+VPN FRR can be
      implemented.

   Routing policies are implemented using the following procedures:

   1.  Define rules: Define features of routes to which routing policies
       are applied.  Users define a set of matching rules based on
       different attributes of routes, such as the destination address
       and the address of the router that advertises the routes.

   2.  Implement the rules: Apply the matching rules to routing policies
       for advertising, receiving, and importing routes.
