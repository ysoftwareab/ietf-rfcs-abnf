Abstract

   To ease the management of a site, the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) is often used. DHCP exists both for the Internet
   Protocol Version 4 (DHCPv4 for IPv4) and Version 6 (DHCPv6 for IPv6).
   To avoid possible pitfalls that occur if both DHCP versions are used
   and to avoid redundancy, IPv4 Information Options may be transmitted
   using DHCPv6 as described in this document. In dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
   scenarios that employ DHCPv6, DHCPv4 can be completely replaced by
   using the DHCPv6 IPv4 Information Options.

Internet-Draft      DHCPv6 IPv4 Information Options        February 2004


1. Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used in both
   domains of IPv4 and IPv6 to configure hosts automatically.  Currently
   DHCP for IPv4 (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315]
   are defined and deployed. One phase during the transition from IPv4
   to IPv6 can be the deployment of IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time
   ("dual-stack"). In particular, a host in a specific broadcast domain
   has both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity on the same port and has both an
   IPv4 and IPv6 stack provided by its operating system. Networks
   running IPv4 or IPv6 protocol use either DHCPv4 or DHCPv6, but
   running both version of DHCP in parallel may cause problems that are
   going to be identified in this document.  Hosts being configured
   using both mechanisms at the same time may end up with a non-useful
   configuration.

   This document discusses the integration of DHCPv4 functionality into
   DHCPv6, and so enabling the configuration of both address domains
   with a single dynamic host configuration protocol. This is achieved
   by adapting DHCPv4 options to DHCPv6 option format and by using
   existing DHCPv6 transport mechanisms.

3. Overview

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a common management tool
   to automatically configure clients in a particular site without the
   need of the administrator's interaction. This configuration includes
   but is not limited to IP addresses, default routers (IPv4) and
   netmasks (IPv4). DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 are the transport and exchange
   protocols for this information. DHCP is not only used for large
   sites. It is also commonly used in SOHO sites e.g. on small broadband
   access routers to automatically configure clients that are attached
   to the local network. There are two, in some scenarios three
   different components in DHCP exchanges: there are always a client and
   a server involved. In some sites, there also exist relay agents that
   relay DHCP messages between different broadcast domains. However,
   relay agents do not alter the information conveyed with the DHCP
   protocols and hence do not need special attention in this document.

   As stated before, there are two different DHCP standards: DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6. Both exist independently, and DHCPv6 is not backward
   compatible with regards to the protocol. The message and option sizes
   differ and the client identification is handled in a different way
   (DHCPv4 uses MAC addresses to identify a client, DHCPv6 uses DHCP
   Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) and Identity Association Identifiers
   (IAIDs)). In theory, both DHCP versions could exist in parallel in
   the same site and a host may be both a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client. But
   there are certain pitfalls described in Section 4, which complicate
   this co-existence. Therefore it is convenient in a number of
   scenarios that are identified in Section 5 to use either DHCPv4 or
   DHCPv6 but not both on the same host. This is only possible if DHCPv6
   is capable of transporting information that is normally transported
   using DHCPv4. The purpose of this document is to present a practical
   solution to this problem by defining DHCPv6 options that contain IPv4
   information. Choosing DHCPv6 over DHCPv4 instead of DHCPv4 over
   DHCPv6 is done for the following reasons:

   o  DHCPv6 is more sophisticated in a number of ways (authentication,
      identification of clients, etc.)

   o  DHCPv6 options can easily be adapted to hold IPv4 information

   o  New DHCPv6 options are easily created to convey IPv4 information

   o  The client's identity is independent of the client's hardware. A
      change of the MAC address of a client has no impact on the
      client's identity stored on the server

   It is important to note that this document does not introduce
   backward compatibility to DHCPv4 in DHCPv6 on the protocol level. The

   state machinery and option format of DHCPv6 stays untouched and fully
   compliant with [RFC3315]. Furthermore, it is not the intention of
   this document to render DHCPv4 obsolete e.g. in IPv4-only sites.

4. Simultaneous DHCPv6 & DHCPv4: Issues

   Issues that occur when employing DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 simultaneously are
   identified in the document: "IPv4 and IPv6 Dual-Stack Issues for
   DHCPv6", T. Chown, S. Venaas, C. Strauf, February 2004,
   draft-chown-dhc-dual-stack-00 (work in progress).

5. Prerequisites & Scenarios

   To use DHCPv6 IPv4 Information Options, the following prerequisites
   must be met:

   o  A DHCPv6 client MUST have both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks in their
      operating systems. IPv4 Information Options MUST NOT be used if an
      IPv4 stack is not present.

   o  A DHCPv6 client that requests IPv4 Information Options SHOULD NOT
      additionally use DHCPv4.

   o  Neither DHCPv6-clients nor -servers that use IPv4 Information
      Options need to ensure the existence of IPv4 connectivity.

   The usage of IPv4 Information Options is the preferred method of
   providing IPv4 information to clients in a dual-stack network where
   DHCPv6 is deployed. In such dual-stack networks, the following
   differentiation is made:

   1.  IPv4-only clients that use DHCPv4.

   2.  Dual-stack or IPv6-only clients that use DHCPv6.

   Dual-stack clients that use DHCPv6 SHOULD NOT additionally use
   DHCPv4. Instead, IPv4 Information Options SHOULD be requested using
   DHCPv6. Information like IPv4 address, IPv4 netmask and IPv4 default
   router is then transmitted using DHCPv6 transport. DHCPv6 can even be
   used if no global IPv6 connectivity is present but site scoped IPv6
   multicast addresses can be used by clients to contact DHCPv6 servers.
   Contrary to DHCPv4, MAC addresses are not used to identify a client.
   Instead, the DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) and Identity Association
   Identifier (IAID) as defined in [RFC3315] are used in the usual
   manner for all DHCPv6 exchanges. This reduces the overhead of
   managing MAC addresses additionally to DUID and IAID.

6. Integrating DHCPv4 options into DHCPv6

   There are two ways of integrating IPv4 specific options into DHCPv6.
   Existing DHCPv4 options can be converted to match the DHCPv6 option
   format or existing DHCPv6 options can be modified to transport IPv4
   information. The latter method is preferred if DHCPv6 offers more
   convenient management methods or if it facilitates the option's
   implementation. In every case, a new option code needs to be assigned
   by the IANA.

   For DHCPv6 options, the address field that normally carries IPv6
   addresses can be reduced from a 128 bits to a 32 bits length. Other
   IPv6 specific parts also need to be adjusted.

   DHCPv4 options need to be reworked to fit the DHCPv6 option format.
   The modified DHCPv4 options can be put into a different context in
   some cases, e.g. as a sub-option of another option. The necessity for
   this has to be decided for each case.

Internet-Draft      DHCPv6 IPv4 Information Options        February 2004


7. State Machine/Protocol Machinery

   The impact of introducing IPv4 options in the DHCPv6 protocol stack
   is minimal. The OPTION_IAADDR_IPv4 option MAY be encapsulated in a
   IA_NA or IA_TA option and its behavior is the same as for IA Address
   Option described in [RFC3315]. As for the other options they MAY be
   requested by the clients using the Option Request option described in
   Section 22.7 of [RFC3315]. The IPv6 address lifetime extension
   procedure described in [RFC3315] applies to IPv4 addresses as well,
   the other IPv4 related options, such as DNS and Default Routers, MUST
   be included in the RENEW/REBIND messages, the IAADDR_IPv4 option
   containing the IPv4 address for renewal MAY coexist together with an
   IPv6 IAADDR option in the same IA_TA or IA_NA option of the DHCPv6
   message. On reception of an IA option which contains both
   OPTION_IAADDR option and an OPTION_IAADDR_IPv4 option, the client
   SHOULD process both options by attaching the IPv6 address to the IPv6
   stack of the interface it was intended to and the IPv4 address to its
   IPv4 stack of the same interface. Also, if the client requested the
   DNS option the server SHOULD send a DNS server address list
   containing the DNS servers in order of preference; the list MAY
   contain both IPv6 addresses and IPv4 addresses in the form of IPv6
   compatibility addresses. The server MAY change the IPv4/IPv6
   addresses and/or DNS settings of the client at any moment with the
   RECONFIGURE message. Message relaying SHOULD use IPv6 addresses only
   as described in [RFC3315].

   server-address: The server address.


8.7 IPv4 DNS Servers & Search Domains

   The DNS Configuration options described in [RFC3646] may be used to
   carry IPv4 addresses in the form of IPv6 compatibility addresses in
   OPTION_DNS_SERVERS. The DHCPv6 client should convert IPv6
   compatibility addresses back to IPv4 addresses on reception before
   using them for configuration purposes. This is mandatory on host
   operating systems that cannot handle IPv6 compatibility addresses.

   All search domains that are necessary for normal operation can be
   transmitted using OPTION_DOMAIN_LIST in [RFC3646]. No additional
   client modifications or interactions are necessary.

8.8 IPv4 Forwarding Enable/Disable Option

   This option specifies whether the client should configure its IPv4
   layer for packet forwarding. A value of 0 means disable IP
   forwarding, and a value of 1 means enable IP forwarding.

10. IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) needs to assign
   numbers to the following option codes from the DHCP option code space
   defined in section "IANA Considerations" of [RFC3315]:

   o  OPTION_IAADDR_IPv4

   o  OPTION_NETMASK

   o  OPTION_ROUTER

   o  OPTION_HOST_NAME

   o  OPTION_FORWARDING

   o  OPTION_BROADCAST

   o  OPTION_WWW
