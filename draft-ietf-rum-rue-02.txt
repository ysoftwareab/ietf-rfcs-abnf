           Interoperability Profile for Relay User Equipment
                         draft-ietf-rum-rue-02

Abstract

   Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by
   which a hearing persons can communicate with deaf/Hard of Hearing
   user using an interpreter ("Communications Assistant") connected via
   a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an audio telephone call to the
   hearing user.  The CA interprets using sign language on the
   videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the
   interpreters may be supplied by a company or agency termed a
   "provider" in this document.  The provider also provides a video
   service that allows users to connect video devices to their service,
   and subsequently to CAs and other dead/HoH users.  It is desirable
   that the videophones used by the deaf/HoH/H-I user conform to a
   standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that
   video calls direct between deaf/HoH users work.  This document
   describes the interface between a videophone and a provider.

1.  Introduction

   Video Relay Service (VRS) is a form of Telecommunications Relay
   Service (TRS) that enables persons with hearing disabilities who use
   sign language, such as American Sign Language (ASL), to communicate
   with voice telephone users through video equipment.  These services
   also enable communication between such individuals directly in
   suitable modalities, including any combination of sign language via
   video, real-time text (RTT), and speech.

   This Interoperability Profile for Relay User Equipment (RUE) is a
   profile of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related media
   protocols that enables end-user equipment registration and calling
   for VRS calls.  It specifies the minimal set of call flows, Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF) and ITU-T standards that must be
   supported, provides guidance where the standards leave multiple
   implementation options, and specifies minimal and extended
   capabilities for RUE calls.

   Both deaf/HoH to provider (interpreted) and direct deaf/HoH to deaf/
   HoH calls are supported on this interface.  While there are some
   accommodations in this document to maximize backwards compatibility
   with devices and services that conform to this document, backwards
   compatibility is not a requirement, and some interwork may be
   required to allow direct video calls to older devices.  This document
   only describes the interface between the device and the provider, and
   not any other interface the provider may have.

2.  Terminology

   Communication Assistant (CA): The ASL interpreter stationed in a TRS-
   registered call center working for a VRS Provider, acting as part of
   the wire of a call to provide functionally equivalent phone service.

   Communication modality (modality): A specific form of communication
   that may be employed by two users, e.g., English voice, Spanish
   voice, American Sign Language, English lip-reading, or French real-
   time-text.  Here, one communication modality is assumed to encompass
   both the language and the way that language is exchanged.  For
   example, English voice and French voice are two different
   communication modalities.

   Default video relay service: The video relay service operated by a
   subscriber's default VRS provider.

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   Default video relay service Provider (default Provider): The VRS
   provider that registers, and assigns a telephone number to, a
   specific subscriber.  A subscriber's default Provider provides the
   VRS that handles incoming relay calls to the user.  The default
   Provider also handles outgoing relay calls by default.

   Dial-around call: A relay call where the subscriber specifies the use
   of a VRS provider other than one of the Providers with whom the
   subscriber is registered.  This can be accomplished by the user
   dialing a "front-door" number for a VRS provider and signing or
   texting a phone number to call ("two-stage").  Alternatively, this
   can be accomplished by the user's RUE software instructing the server
   of its default VRS provider to automatically route the call through
   the alternate Provider to the desired public switched telephone
   network (PSTN) directory number ("one-stage").

   Full Intra Request (FIR): A request to a media sender, requiring that
   media sender to send a Decoder Refresh Point at the earliest
   opportunity.  FIR is sometimes known as "instantaneous decoder
   refresh request", "video fast update request", or "fast update
   request".  Point-to-Point Call (P2P Call): A call between two RUEs,
   without including a CA.

   Relay call: A call that allows persons with hearing or speech
   disabilities to use a RUE to talk to users of traditional voice
   services with the aid of a communication assistant (CA) to relay the
   communication.  Please refer to FCC-VRS-GUIDE.

   Relay-to-relay call: A call between two subscribers each using
   different forms of relay (video relay, IP relay, TTY), each with a
   separate CA to assist in relaying the conversation.

   Relay service (RS): A service that allow a registered subscriber to
   use a RUE to make and receive relay calls, point-to-point calls, and
   relay-to-relay calls.  The functions provided by the relay service
   include the provision of media links supporting the communication
   modalities used by the caller and callee, and user registration and
   validation, authentication, authorization, automatic call distributor
   (ACD) platform functions, routing (including emergency call routing),
   call setup, mapping, call features (such as call forwarding and video
   mail), and assignment of CAs to relay calls.

   Relay service Provider (Provider): An organization that operates a
   relay service.  A subscriber selects a relay service Provider to
   assign and register a telephone number for their use, to register
   with for receipt of incoming calls, and to provide the default
   service for outgoing calls.

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   Relay user: Please refer to "subscriber".

   Relay user E.164 Number (user E.164): The telephone number assigned
   to the RUE in ITU-T E.164 format.

   Relay user equipment (RUE): A SIP user agent (UA) enhanced with extra
   features to support a subscriber in requesting and using relay calls.
   A RUE may take many forms, including a stand-alone device; an
   application running on a general-purpose computing device such as a
   laptop, tablet or smart phone; or proprietary equipment connected to
   a server that provides the RUE interface.

   RUE Interface: the SIP interface between a RUE and the provider who
   supports it

   Sign language: A language that uses hand gestures and body language
   to convey meaning including, but not limited to, American Sign
   Language (ASL).

   Subscriber: An individual who has registered with a Provider and who
   obtains service by using relay user equipment.  This is the
   traditional telecom term for an end-user customer, which in our case
   is a relay user.

   Telecommunications relay services (TRS): Telephone transmission
   services that provide the ability for an individual who has a hearing
   impairment or speech impairment to engage in communication by wire or
   radio with a hearing individual in a manner that is functionally
   equivalent to the ability of an individual who does not have a
   hearing impairment or speech impairment to communicate using voice
   communication services by wire or radio.  TRS includes services that
   enable two-way communication between an individual who uses a
   Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) or other non-voice
   terminal device and an individual who does not use such a device.

   Video relay service (VRS): A relay service for people with hearing or
   speech disabilities who use sign language to communicate using video
   equipment (video RUE) with other people in real time.  The video link
   allows the CA to view and interpret the subscriber's signed
   conversation and relay the conversation back and forth with the other
   party.

3.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

4.  General Requirements

   All HTTP/HTTPS connections specified throughout this document MUST
   use HTTPS.  Both HTTPS and all SIP connections MUST use TLS
   conforming to at least [RFC7525] and must support [RFC8446]

   All text data payloads not otherwise constrained by a specification
   in another standards document MUST be encoded as Unicode UTF/8.

5.  SIP Signaling

   Implementations of the RUE Interface MUST conform to the following
   core SIP standards [RFC3261] (Base SIP) [RFC3263] (Locating SIP
   Servers), [RFC3264] (Offer/Answer), [RFC3840] (User Agent
   Capabilities), [RFC5626] (Outbound), [RFC4566] (Session Description
   Protocol), [RFC3323] (Privacy), [RFC3605] (RTCP Attribute in SDP),
   [RFC6665] (SIP Events), [RFC3311] (UPDATE Method), [RFC5393] (Loop-
   Fix), [RFC5658] (Record Route fix), [RFC5954] (ABNF fix), [RFC3960]
   (Early Media), and [RFC6442] (Geolocation Header).

   In addition, the implementations, conform to [RFC3327] (Path),
   [RFC5245] (ICE), [RFC3326] (Reason header), [RFC3515] (REFER Method),
   [RFC3891] (Replaces Header), [RFC3892] (Referred-By).

   Implementations MUST include a "User-Agent" header field uniquely
   identifying the RUE application, platform, and version in all SIP
   requests, and MUST include a "Server" header field with the same
   content in SIP responses.

5.1.  Registration

   The RUE MUST register with a SIP registrar, following [RFC3261] and
   [RFC5626].  If the configuration (please refer to Section 11)
   contains multiple "outbound-proxies", then the RUE MUST use them as
   specified in [RFC5626] to establish multiple flows.

   The request-URI for the REGISTER request MUST contain the "provider-
   domain" from the configuration.  The To-URI and From-URI MUST be
   identical URIs, formatted as specified in Section 13, using the
   "phone-number" and "provider-domain" from the configuration.

   The RUE determines the URI to resolve by initially determining if an
   outbound proxy is configured.  If it is, the URI will be that of the
   outbound proxy.  If no outbound proxy is configured, the URI will be
   the Request-URI from the REGISTER request.  The RUE extracts the
   domain from that URI and consults the DNS record for that domain.
   The DNS entry MUST contain NAPTR records conforming to RFC3263.  One
   of those NAPTR records MUST specify TLS as the preferred transport



Rosen                     Expires 1 August 2020                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   for SIP.  For example, a DNS NAPTR query for "sip:
   p1.red.example.netv" could return:

         IN NAPTR 50  50 "s" "SIPS+D2T" "" _sips._tcp.p1.red.example.net
         IN NAPTR 90  50 "s" "SIP+D2T"  "" _sip._tcp.p1.red.example.net

   If the RUE receives a 439 (First Hop Lacks Outbound Support) response
   to a REGISTER request, it MUST re-attempt registration without using
   the outbound mechanism.

   The registrar MAY authenticate using SIP MD5 digest authentication.
   The credentials to be used (username and password) MUST be supplied
   within the credentials section of the configuration and identified by
   the realm the registrar uses in a digest challenge.  This username/
   password combination SHOULD NOT be the same as that used for other
   purposes, such as retrieving the RUE configuration or logging into
   the Provider's customer service portal.  Because MD5 is considered
   insecure, [I-D.yusef-sipcore-digest-scheme] SHOULD be implemented by
   all implementations and SHA-based digest algorithms SHOULD be used
   for digest authentication.

   If the registration request fails with an indication that credentials
   from the configuration are invalid, then the RUE SHOULD retrieve a
   fresh version of the configuration.  If credentials from a freshly
   retrieved configuration are found to be invalid, then the RUE MUST
   cease attempts to register and SHOULD inform the RUE User of the
   problem.

   Support for multiple simultaneous registrations is OPTIONAL.

   Multiple simultaneous RUE SIP registrations from different RUE
   devices with the same SIP URI SHOULD be permitted by the Provider.
   The Provider MAY limit the total number of simultaneous
   registrations.  When a new registration request is received that
   results in exceeding the limit on simultaneous registrations, the
   Provider MAY then prematurely terminate another registration;
   however, it SHOULD NOT do this if it would disconnect an active call.

   If a Provider prematurely terminates a registration to reduce the
   total number of concurrent registrations with the same URI, it SHOULD
   take some action to prevent the affected RUE from automatically re-
   registering and re-triggering the condition.

5.2.  Session Establishment

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


5.2.1.  Normal Call Origination

   After initial SIP registration, the RUE adheres to SIP [RFC3261]
   basic call flows, as documented in [RFC3665].

   The all outbound calls MUST be routed through an outbound proxy if
   configured.

   INVITE requests used to initiate calls SHOULD NOT contain Route
   headers.  Route headers MAY be included in one-stage dial-around
   calls and emergency calls.  The SIP URIs in the To field and the
   Request-URI MUST be formatted as specified in subsection 6.4 using
   the destination phone number.  The domain field of the URIs SHOULD be
   the "provider-domain" from the configuration (e.g.,
   sip:+13115552368@red.example.com;user=phone).  The same exceptions
   apply, including anonymous calls.

   Anonymous calls MUST be supported by all implementations.  An
   anonymous call is signaled per [RFC3323].

   The From-URI MUST be formatted as specified in Section 5.4, using the
   phone-number and "provider-domain" from the configuration.  It SHOULD
   also contain the display-name from the configuration when present.
   (Please refer to Section 9.2.)

   Negotiated media MUST follow the guidelines specified in Section 6 of
   this document.

   To allow time to timeout an unanswered call and direct it to a
   videomail server, the User Agent Client MUST NOT impose a time limit
   less than the default SIP Invite transaction timeout of 3 minutes.

5.2.2.  One-Stage Dial-Around Origination

   Outbound dial-around calls allow a RUE user to select any Provider to
   provide interpreting services for any call.  "Two-stage" dial-around
   calls involve the RUE calling a telephone number that reaches the
   dial-around Provider and using signing or DTMF to provide the called
   party telephone number.  In two-stage dial-around, the To URI is the
   URI of the dial-around Provider and the domain of the URI is the
   Provider domain from the configuration.

   One-stage dial-around is a method where the called party telephone
   number is provided in the To URI and the Request-URI, using the
   domain of the dial-around Provider.

   For one-stage dial-around, the RUE MUST follow the procedures in
   Section 5.2.1 with the following exception: the domain part of the



Rosen                     Expires 1 August 2020                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   SIP URIs in the To field and the Request-URI MUST be the domain of
   the dial-around Provider, discovered according to Section 9.1.

   The following is a partial example of a one-stage dial-around call
   from VRS user +1-555-222-0001 hosted by red.example.com to a hearing
   user +1-555-123-4567 using dial-around to green.example.com for the
   relay service.  Only important details of the messages are shown and
   many header fields have been omitted:

5.2.3.  RUE Contact Information

   To identify the owner of a RUE, the initial INVITE for a call from a
   RUE, or the 200 OK accepting a call by a RUE, identifies the owner by
   sending a Call-Info header with a purpose parameter of "rue-owner".
   The URI MAY be an HTTPS URI or Content-Indirect URL.  The latter is
   defined by [RFC2392] to locate message body parts.  This URI type is
   present in a SIP message to convey the RUE ownership information as a
   MIME body.  The form of the RUE ownership information is a jCard
   [RFC7095].  Please refer to [RFC6442] for an example of using

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   Content-Indirect URLs in SIP messages.  Note that use of the Content-
   Indirect URL usually implies multiple message bodies ("mime/
   multipart").

5.2.4.  Incoming Calls

   The RUE MUST accept inbound calls sent to it by the proxy mentioned
   in the configuration.

   If Multiple simultaneous RUE SIP registrations from different RUE
   devices with the same SIP URI exist, the Provider MUST parallel fork
   the call to all registered RUEs so that they ring at the same time.
   The first RUE to reply with a 200 OK answers the call and the
   Provider MUST CANCEL other call branches.

5.2.5.  Emergency Calls

   The implementations comply with [RFC6881] for handling of emergency
   calls.

   If the emergency call is to be handled using existing country
   specific procedures, the Provider is responsible for modifying the
   INVITE to conform to the country-specific requirements.  In this
   case, location MAY be extracted from the RFC6881 conformant INVITE
   and used to propagate it to the appropriate country-specific
   entities.  Because the RUE may have a more accurate and timely
   location of the device than the a manual entry location for nomadic
   RUE devices, but country-specific procedures require the location to
   be pre-loaded in some entity prior to placing an emergency call,
   implementations MAY send a Geolocation header containing its location
   in the REGISTER request if the configuration specifies it.  That
   information MAY be used to populate the location to appropriate
   country-specific entities.

   Implementations MUST implement Additional Data, [RFC7852].  Clients
   MUST implement Data Provider, Device Implementation and Owner/
   Subscriber Information blocks.  Servers MUST implement Data Provider
   and Service Information blocks as the call is forwarded to the PSAP.

5.3.  Mid Call Signaling

   Implementations MUST support re-INVITE to renegotiate media session
   parameters (among other uses).  Per Section 6.1, implementations
   MUST, be able to support an INFO request for full frame refresh for
   devices that do not support RTCP mechanisms (please refer to
   Section 6.8).  Implementations MUST support an in-dialog REFER
   ([RFC3515] updated by [RFC7647] and including support for norefersub
   per [RFC4488]) with the Replaces header [RFC3891] to enable call
   transfer.

5.4.  URI Representation of Phone Numbers

   SIP URIs constructed from non-URI sources (dial strings) and sent to
   SIP proxies by the RUE MUST be represented as follows, depending on
   whether they can be represented as an E.164 number.

   A dial string that can be written as an E.164 formatted phone number
   MUST be represented as a SIP URI with a URI ";user=phone" tag.  The
   user part of the URI MUST be in conformance with 'global-number'
   defined in [RFC3966].  The user part MUST NOT contain any 'visual-
   separator' characters.

   Dial strings that cannot be written as E.164 numbers MUST be
   represented as dialstring URIs, as specified by [RFC4967], e.g.,
   sip:411@red.example.net;user=dialstring.

   The domain part of Relay Service URIs and User Address of Records
   (AoR) MUST (using resolve (in accord with [RFC3263]) to globally
   routable IPv4 addresses.  The AoRs MAY also resolve to IPv6
   addresses.

5.5.  Transport

   Implementations MUST conform to [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-transports] with the
   understanding that this specification does not use the WebRTC data
   channel.

   Implementations MUST support SIP outbound [RFC5626] (please also
   refer to Section 5.1).

6.  Media

   This specification adopts the media specifications for WebRTC
   ([I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview]).  Where WebRTC defines how interactive
   media communications may be established using a browser as a client,
   this specification assumes a normal SIP call.  The RTP, RTCP, SDP and
   specific media requirements specified for WebRTC are adopted for this

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   document.  The RUE is a WebRTC non-browser" endpoint, except as noted
   expressly below.

   The following sections specify the WebRTC documents to which
   conformance is required.  "Mandatory to Implement" means a conforming
   implementation must implement the specified capability.  It does not
   mean that the capability must be used in every session.  For example,
   OPUS is a mandatory to implement audio codec, and all conforming
   implementations must support OPUS.  However, implementation
   presenting a call across the RUE Interface where the call originates
   in the Public Switched Telephone Network, or an older, non-RUE-
   compatible device, which only offers G.711 audio, does not need to
   include the OPUS codec in the offer, since it cannot be used with
   that call.

6.1.  SRTP and SRTCP

   Implementations MUST support [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage] with the
   understanding that RUE Interface does not specify an API and
   therefore MediaStreamTracks are not used.  Implementations MUST
   conform to Section 6.4 of [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch].

6.2.  Text-Based Communication

   Implementations MUST support real-time text ([RFC4102] and [RFC4103])
   via T.140 media.  One original and two redundant generations MUST be
   transmitted and supported, with a 300 ms transmission interval.  Note
   that this is not how real time text is transmitted in WebRTC and some
   form of transcoder would be required to interwork real time text in
   the data channel of WebRTC to RFC4103 real time text.

6.3.  Video

   Implementations MUST conform to [RFC7742] with the exception that,
   since backwards compatibility is desirable and older devices do not
   support VP8, that only H.264, as specified in [RFC7742] is Mandatory
   to Implement.

6.4.  Audio

   Implementations MUST conform to [RFC7874].

6.5.  DTMF Digits

   Implementations MUST support the "audio/telephone-event" [RFC4733]
   media type.  They MUST support conveying event codes 0 through 11
   (DTMF digits "0"-"9", "*","#") defined in Table 7 of [RFC4733].
   Handling of other tones is OPTIONAL.

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


6.6.  Session Description Protocol

   The SDP offers and answers MUST conform [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep] with
   the understanding that the RUE Interface uses SIP transport for SDP.

6.7.  Privacy

   The RUE MUST be able to control privacy of the user by implementing a
   one-way mute of audio and or video, without signaling, locally, but
   MUST maintain any NAT bindings by periodically sending media packets
   on all active media sessions containing silence/comfort noise/black
   screen/etc. per [RFC6263].

6.8.  Negative Acknowledgment, Packet Loss Indicator, and Full
      Intraframe Request Features

   NACK SHOULD be used when negotiated and conditions warrant its use.
   Signaling picture losses as Packet Loss Indicator (PLI) SHOULD be
   preferred, as described in [RFC5104].

   FIR SHOULD be used only in situations where not sending a decoder
   refresh point would render the video unusable for the users, as per
   RFC5104 subsection 4.3.1.2.

   For backwards compatibility with calling devices that do not support
   the foregoing methods, implementations MUST implement SIP INFO
   messages to send and receive XML encoded Picture Fast Update messages
   according to [RFC5168].

7.  Contacts

7.1.  CardDAV Login and Synchronization

   Support of CardDAV by Providers is OPTIONAL.

   The RUE MUST and Providers MAY be able to synchronize the user's
   contact directory between the RUE endpoint and one maintained by the
   user's VRS provider using CardDAV ([RFC6352] and [RFC6764]).

   The configuration MAY supply a username and domain identifying a
   CardDAV server and address book for this account.

   To access the CardDAV server and address book, the RUE MUST follow
   Section 6 of RFC6764, using the chosen username and domain in place
   of an email address.  If the request triggers a challenge for digest
   authentication credentials, the RUE MUST attempt to continue using
   matching "credentials" from the configuration.  If no matching
   credentials are configured, the RUE MUST use the SIP credentials from



Rosen                     Expires 1 August 2020                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   the configuration.  If the SIP credentials fail, the RUE MUST query
   the user.

   Synchronization using CardDAV MUST be a two-way synchronization
   service, with proper handling of asynchronous adds, changes, and
   deletes at either end of the transport channel.

7.2.  Contacts Import/Export Service

   Implementations MUST be able to export/import the list of contacts in
   jCard [RFC7095] json format.

   The RUE accesses this service via the "contacts" URI in the
   configuration.  The URL MUST resolve to identify a web server
   resource that imports/exports contact lists for authorized users.

   The RUE stores/retrieves the contact list (address book) by issuing
   an HTTPS POST or GET request.  If the request triggers a challenge
   for digest authentication credentials, the RUE MUST attempt to
   continue using matching "credentials" from the configuration.  If no
   credentials are configured, the RUE MUST query the user.

8.  Mail Waiting Indicator (MWI)

   Support of MWI by Providers is OPTIONAL

   Implementations MUST support subscriptions to "message-summary"
   events [RFC3842] to the URI specified in the configuration.

   In notification bodies, videomail messages SHOULD be reported using
   "message-context-class multimedia-message" defined in [RFC3458].

9.  Provisioning and Provider Selection

   To simplify how users interact with RUE devices, the RUE interface
   defines a provisioning mechanism which consist of files stored on
   server that are retrieved by the RUE device.  Two files are
   supported: one provides a directory of providers so that a user
   interface that allows easy provider selection either for registering
   or for dial-around.  The other file provides configuration data for
   the device.  The RUE device would retrieve these files at boot time.
   No mechanism for creating the files are specified.  Each of the files
   contains a single json object.  The retrieval mechanism is HTTPS
   download of that object from a provisioned location.

9.1.  RUE Provider Selection

   To allow the user to select a relay service, the RUE MAY obtain, on
   startup, a list of Providers from a configured accessible URL.  This
   file is MAY be a single file per country, containing all the
   providers authorized in that country, but MAY be any collection of
   providers.

   The provider list, formatted as JSON, contains:

   *  Version: Specifies the version number of the Provider list format.
      A new version number SHOULD only be used if the new version is not
      backwards-compatible with the older version.  A new version number
      is not needed if new elements are optional and can be ignored by
      older implementations.

   *  Providers: An array where each entry describes one Provider.  Each
      entry consists of the following items:

      -  name: This parameter contains the text label identifying the
         Provider and is meant to be displayed to the human VRS user.

      -  domain: The domain parameter is used for configuration purposes
         by the RUE (as discussed in Section 9.2) and as the domain to
         use when targeting one-stage dial-around calls to this Provider
         (as discussed in Section 5.2.2).

      -  operator: (OPTIONAL) The operator parameter is a SIP URL that
         identifies the operator "front-door" that VRS users may contact
         for manual (two-stage) dial-around calls.

   The VRS user interacts with the RUE to select from the Provider list
   one or more Providers with whom the user has already established an
   account.

9.2.  RUE Configuration Service

   A RUE device may retrieve a configuration from a provisioned URL
   using HTTPs.

   The data returned will include a set of key/value configuration
   parameters to be used by the RUE, formatted as a single JSON object
   and identified by the associated [RFC7159] "application/json" MIME
   type, to allow for other formats in the future.

   The configuration data payload includes the following data items.
   Items not noted as (OPTIONAL) are REQUIRED.  If other unexpected
   items are found, they MUST be ignored.

   *  version: Identifies the version of the configuration data format.
      A new version number SHOULD only be used if the new version is not
      backwards-compatible with the older version.  A new version number
      is not needed if new elements are optional and can be ignored by
      older implementations.

   *  lifetime: Specifies how long (in seconds) the RUE MAY cache the
      configuration values.  Values may not be valid when lifetime
      expires.  Emergency Calls MUST continue to work.

   *  display-name: (OPTIONAL) A user-friendly name to identify the
      subscriber when originating calls.

Internet-Draft        Relay User Equipment Profile          January 2020


   *  phone-number: The telephone number (in E.164 format) assigned to
      this subscriber.  This becomes the user portion of the SIP URI
      identifying the subscriber.

   *  provider-domain: The DNS domain name of the default Provider
      servicing this subscriber.

   *  outbound-proxies: (OPTIONAL) A URI of a SIP proxy to be used when
      sending requests to the Provider.

   *  mwi: (OPTIONAL) A URI identifying a SIP event server that
      generates "message-summary" events for this subscriber.

   *  videomail: (OPTIONAL) A SIP URI that can be called to retrieve
      videomail messages.

   *  contacts: An HTTPS URI that may be used to export (retrieve) the
      subscriber's complete contact list managed by the Provider.

   *  carddav: (OPTIONAL) A username and domain name (separated by
      ""@"") identifying a "CardDAV" server and user name that can be
      used to synchronize the RUE's contact list with the contact list
      managed by the Provider.

   *  sendLocationWithRegistration: True if the RUE should send a
      Geolocation Header with REGISTER, false if it should not.
      Defaults to false if not present.

   *  ice-servers: (OPTIONAL) An array of URLs identifying STUN and TURN
      servers available for use by the RUE for establishing media
      streams in calls via the Provider.

   *  credentials: (OPTIONAL) TBD

                                  Figure 3

   The wire format of the data is in keeping with the standard JSON
   description in RFC7159.

   The "lifetime" parameter in the configuration indicates how long the
   RUE MAY cache the configuration values.  If the RUE caches
   configuration values, it MUST cryptographically protect them.  The
   RUE SHOULD retrieve a fresh copy of the configuration before the
   lifetime expires or as soon as possible after it expires.  The
   lifetime is not guaranteed: the configuration may change before the
   lifetime value expires.  In that case, the Provider MAY indicate this
   by generating authorization challenges to requests and/or prematurely
   terminating a registration.

   Note: In some cases, the RUE may successfully retrieve a fresh copy
   of the configuration using digest credentials cached from the prior
   retrieval.  If this is not successful, then the RUE will need to ask
   the user for the username and password.  Unfortunately, this
   authentication step might occur when the user is not present,
   preventing SIP registration and thus incoming calls.  To avoid this
   situation, the RUE MAY retrieve a new copy of the configuration when
   it knows the user is present, even if there is time before the
   lifetime expires.

   The following JSON schemas are for the Provider List and the RUE
   Configuration.  These are represented using the JSON Content Rules
   [JCR] schema notation.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

12.  Security Considerations

   The RUE is required to communicate with servers on public IP
   addresses and specific ports to perform its required functions.  If
   it is necessary for the RUE to function on a corporate or other
   network that operates a default-deny firewall between the RUE and
   these services, the user must arrange with their network manager for
   passage of traffic through such a firewall in accordance with the
   protocols and associated SRV records as exposed by the Provider.
   Because VRS providers may use different ports for different services,
   these port numbers may differ from Provider to Provider.
