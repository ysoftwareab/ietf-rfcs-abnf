Abstract

This memo describes a SMIv2 MIB module for a device implementing
bridging functions with Quality-of-Service mechanisms similar to those
described for the Differentiated Services Architecture [DSARCH] which
are described in detail by the Differentiated Services Router Conceptual
Model [MODEL].  A MIB module for routers, the Diffserv MIB [DSMIB], has
been developed that uses this model. The MIB module defined in this memo
is designed to work in conjunction with that module: it defines usage
for objects in that module and defines some new objects specific to MAC-
layer bridges (a.k.a. Layer-2 switches). Specifically, if defines
layer-2 classifier and packet marking functionality.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC
        2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are defined using
the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine-readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.

2.  Structure of this MIB

This MIB module is consistent with the Conceptual Model (for Diffserv
routers) documented in [MODEL] and is designed to work in conjunction
with the Differentiated Services MIB [DSMIB]. That MIB defines a basic
structure for the QoS components of generalised "packet routers", as
well as specific objects for representing IP- and some higher-layer
constructs.

The Conceptual Model and Diffserv MIB structures are general enough to
represent the QoS components of the current generation of multi-layer
switches which often incorporate both layer-3 and layer-2 functionality
e.g. they are a combination of the traditional IP router and MAC bridge.
Such devices, therefore, fit well with this conceptual model.

2.1.  Overview

The Conceptual Model discusses how ingress and egress interfaces of an
'n'-port router are to be modelled in the same way as each other.  This
is derived from the requirement, in general, to be able to perform the
same traffic conditioning functions on individual ingress interfaces
(e.g. from a particular location/customer/machine) as on egress
interfaces (e.g. to a particular location/customer/machine). This model
is shown in Figure 1 which is taken from [MODEL].

Each interface then performs the following high-level functions in each

             Interface A                        Interface B

direction:

o    Classify each packet according to some set of rules

o    Determine whether the data stream the packet is part of is within
     or outside its rate

o    Perform a set of resulting actions, possibly including counting the
     traffic, application of an appropriate drop policy and marking of
     the traffic in some way.

o    Enqueue the traffic for output in the appropriate queue, whose
     scheduler may shape the traffic or simply forward it with some
     minimum rate or maximum latency.

Note that any of these operations may be a no-op or use default settings
in a particular implementation. Thus, a standard 802.1D-1998 bridge
[802.1D] can be modelled as in Figure 2 where the term ".1p" or "802.1p"
is used to represent the user_priority value used to identify traffic
classes both on the wire as a 3-bit user_priority packet field, often
known as the "802.1p priority bits", as well as within the 802.1D bridge
architecture (as an internal parameter).

In addition, this MIB also supports the concept of "QoS classification
by VLAN" where appropriate local QoS treatment is applied based on the
IEEE 802.1Q VLAN with which a given packet is associated - this may be
either a direct classification of the packet based on a 802.1Q VLAN-ID
field present in the packet or else it may be the VLAN to which the
packet has been assigned, based on IEEE 802.1Q ingress VLAN
classification rules. See [802.1Q] for further details of this process:
[BRIDGEMIB] uses the same concepts and, in fact, the present MIB borrows
indexing variables from that MIB.

This MIB, therefore, adds to the contents of [DSMIB] as follows:

Classifier and Filter Tables
     A user_priority classifier element table, dot1dQosUserPriTable, and
     an 802.1Q VLAN classifier element table, dot1dQosVlanClfrTable.
     Each of these table's elements are intended to be pointed at by
     diffServClassifierFilter pointers in diffServClassifierTable
     entries.

Meter Tables
     No additions are required here - the meters in the Diffserv MIB are
     defined in a layer-neutral way that can be used for MAC-layer
     bridges.

Action Tables
     Absolute Drop and Count actions are sufficiently defined in
     Diffserv MIB.  For Markers, a user_priority Marker element can be
     achieved by re-using entries in dot1dQosUserPriTable: these are
     intended also to be pointed at by diffServActionSpecific pointers
     of entries in diffServActionTable.

Queue, Scheduler and Algorithmic Dropper Tables
     No additions are required here - the Queue, Scheduler and
     Algorithmic Dropper Table are all defined in a layer-neutral way.
     They offer a superset of the default queuing behaviours defined by
     IEEE 802.1D-1998.

2.2.  MIB Representation of 802.1D Bridge

Figure 3 illustrates how the basic functions of a 802.1D bridge
implementing priority queuing on 2 queues on each of 2 ports, numbered
as ports 1 and 2, are represented in the structures of the Diffserv MIB
and this MIB. The diagram shows just one half of the structures
representing the bridge (just one "direction" of traffic flow through
the bridge).  Note that most of the elements of the Diffserv MIB are
indexed by a tuple of {ifIndex, direction, uniqueid}. In addition,
classifier elements include a "level" index as well.

Internet Draft               Bridge QoS MIB                    June 2000


The 802.1D user_priority classifier is represented here by pointers into
dot1dQosUserPriTable which is indexed by the user_priority value itself.
This table is statically populated with the 8 values.  Note that IEEE
802.1D has no concept of re-marking of packets that are already marked
with a user_priority value. The "user priority regeneration" functions
of 802.1D are outside the scope of this memo - they are assumed to have
occured prior to the classifier stage described here i.e. packets that
did not have an incoming user_priority marking have one assigned to them
before they are passed to the classifier described here (this process
may be managed using the MIB objects already defined in [BRIDGEMIB]).
There are no additional functional elements on the ingress side of a
standard 802.1D bridge.

On the egress side, there are no classification, meter or action
elements (counter action elements are omitted in this discussion for
clarity - the standard only defines these on a per-interface basis, not
per-traffic-class so they are of marginal use in QoS monitoring).
Queueing elements are limited to FIFO queues, possibly preceded by an
Algorithmic Dropper implementing a tail-drop algorithm - the standard is
silent on this behaviour and, according to the 802.1D defaults, a strict
priority scheduler between the traffic classes.

2.3.  MIB Representation of More Complex Bridge

Many devices exist that perform a superset of the QoS functions of a
standard IEEE 802.1D bridge. The additional capabilities are often of a
similar form to the capabilities of Diffserv routers [MODEL] and these
devices are often deployed in situations similar to traditional routers
e.g. service-provider networks, where similar functions to Diffserv
routers are required.  It is advantageous to be able to use the same
management tools to control and monitor such devices. Additional
capabilities that such devices may offer include, but are not limited
to:

(o)  The capability of more complex Scheduler behaviours than the basic
     strict-priority scheduler which is the default behaviour defined in
     802.1D. Examples might include weighted round-robin or non-work-
     conserving schedulers that can apply limits on the bandwidth
     allowed to a given traffic class.

o    Metering capabilities on its input ports in order to apply rate-
     limiting and policing.

o    user_priority (re-)marking capabilities, either static or else
     based on metering results.

Such capabilities may be easily modelled by the Diffserv MIB without
further additions.

3.  Editorial information

<this section will be removed before publication>

3.1.  Open issues

(1)  Should this MIB use user_priority with masks instead of a flat list
     of 8 read-only values? This would require read-write capability on
     the table. (NO).

(2)  Should this MIB use VlanIndex with masks or ranges instead of a
     list of individual values? This would be more complex but could be
     more efficient for scenarios where ranges of VLAN-ID were
     meaningful. (NO).

-- Usage of this MIB module in conjunction with the Diffserv MIB.
--
--    Classifiers - this MIB defines two new classifier filter
--       element types:
--
--       - to compare the IEEE 802.1D user_priority value
--         from a packet. Classifier elements are each one of the
--         entries from dot1dQosUserPriTable and may be pointed to
--         by diffServClassifierFilter values.
--
--       - to compare the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN with which a packet is
--         associated. Note that this classification is considered
--         to take place on all packets that pass through this
--         particular element regardless of their incoming or outgoing
--         tagged/untagged status: i.e. the QoS classifier is considered
--         to take place "after" the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN ingress rules have
--         been applied. Therefore, the VLAN identifier implied is the
--         one which the Bridge MIB considers to be attached to each
--         packet. Such classifier filter elements are each one of the
--         entries from dot1dQosVlanClfrTable and may be pointed to by
--         diffServClassifierFilter values.
--
--    Meters - this MIB includes no new definitions or usage for Meters.
--
--    Actions - this MIB includes no new definitions for Actions.
--
--       A Marker action, to mark packets with an 802.1D user_priority
--       value, may be defined by creating a diffServActionEntry
--       which has a diffServActionSpecific pointing at one of the
--       entries in dot1dQosUserPriTable. Note that this remarking
--       action, which is considered to take place for all packets that
--       pass through this particular element regardless of their
--       incoming or outgoing tagged/untagges status, is not one that is
--       supported by the standard IEEE 802.1D model.
--
--       Note that remarking with a VLAN-ID is not considered to be a
--       QoS action - facilities for handling VLAN-ID tags in
--       accordance with IEEE 802.1Q are provided in the Bridge MIB
--       [BRIDGEMIB].
--
--    Queues, Algorithmic Droppers and Schedulers - this MIB includes no
--       new definitions or usage for these elements.

5.  Security Considerations

It is clear that this MIB is potentially useful for configuration, and
anything that can be configured can be misconfigured, with potentially
disastrous effect.

At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond those
that SNMP Security is itself intended to address. These relate primarily
to controlled access to sensitive information and the ability to
configure a device - or which might result from operator error, which is
beyond the scope of any security architecture.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects may be
considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations. The use of
SNMP Version 3 is recommended over prior versions for configuration
control as its security model is improved.

There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
information that may be sensitive from a business perspective, in that
they may represent a customer's service contract or the filters that the
service provider chooses to apply to a customer's ingress or egress
traffic. There are no objects which are sensitive in their own right,
such as passwords or monetary amounts.

It may be important to control even GET access to these objects and
possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features for
such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network itself
is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control
as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model [12] and the View-based Access Control Model [15]
is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give

access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
