  An Extension for Identification of Groups in the Session Description

Abstract

   RFC 5888 defines a mechanism for semantically grouping media sections
   in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  One difficulty that has
   arisen in several applications of SDP is the need to uniquely
   identify these groups either in other protocols or elsewhere in the
   SDP itself.

   This document proposes a simple, backwards-compatible mechanism that
   provides unambiguous identifiers for RFC 5888 groups.

   This document updates RFC 5888.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5888] defines a mechanism for semantically grouping media
   sections in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] for
   purposes such as lip sync and flow identification.  That mechanism,
   however, defines anonymous groupings, which makes it impossible to
   reliably and unambiguously refer to such groups at a later time (e.g.
   elsewhere in the SDP, or in an application-layer protocol).  This
   document defines a new attribute, "group-id", that can be used to
   attach identifiers to SDP groups.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Mechanism Description

   The mechanism used to assign identifiers to group is very simple and
   straightforward: implementations that wish to assign an identifier to
   groups include a single "group-id" attribute immediately before each
   "group" attribute in the session.  Importantly, it retains backwards-
   compatible with existing [RFC5888] implementations.  This "group-id"
   attribute contains a single token, unique within the session, that
   unambiguously identifies the group defined on the following line.
   Each media section included in that group additionally MUST contain
   an "in-group" attribute that includes the [RFC5888] semantic
   identifier and group-id.  This "in-group" identifier is intended to

   allow media sections to be self-describing when they appear outside
   the context of a full session.

   For clarity: if an implementation includes a group-id for any groups
   in a session, that implementation MUST include a group-id for every
   group in that session.  Implementations MUST NOT include any
   attributes between a "group-id" attribute and the "group" attribute
   it identifies.  Recipients of such SDP in which a "group-id" appears
   followed by anything other than the "group" attribute MUST ignore the
   errant "group-id" line.

   A simple example of the new group-id syntax follows.  This example
   defines a single lip-sync group, and identifies it with the group
   identifier "abc."

          v=0
          o=Laura 289083124 289083124 IN IP4 eight.example.com
          c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
          t=0 0
          a=group-id:abc
          a=group:LS 1 2
          m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0
          a=mid:1
          a=in-group:LS abc
          m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 8
          a=mid:2
          a=in-group:LS abc


4.  Syntax

   The new attributes introduced by this mechanism are defined by the
   following ABNF [RFC5234]:

              groupid-attribute = "a=group-id:" group-id

              group-id          = token ; token is defined in RFC 4566

              in-group-attr     = "a=in-group:" semantics SP group-id
                                  ; semantics is defined in RFC 5888


5.  Security Considerations

   This mechanism does not introduce any security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC5888].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two SDP attributes: "group-id" and "in-group".
   They are to be registered by IANA in the "SDP Parameters" registry as
   follows:

      SDP Attribute ("att-field"):

        Attribute name:     group-id
        Long form:          Group ID
        Type of name:       att-field
        Type of attribute:  session level
        Subject to charset: no
        Purpose:            Identification of SDP groups
        Reference:          this document
        Values:             any token


      SDP Attribute ("att-field"):

        Attribute name:     in-group
        Long form:          Add media section to group
        Type of name:       att-field
        Type of attribute:  media level
        Subject to charset: no
        Purpose:            Associating media sections with groups
        Reference:          this document
        Values:             semantic type followed by group identifier
