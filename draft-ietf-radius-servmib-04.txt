     2.  Abstract

     This  memo  defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS server
     functions. These extensions represent  a  portion  of  the  Management
     Information  Base  (MIB)  for use with network management protocols in
     the Internet community.  Using these  extensions  IP-based  management
     stations can manage RADIUS servers.


     3.  Introduction

     This  memo  defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
     for use with network management protocols in the  Internet  community.
     In  particular,  it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
     servers.

     RADIUS servers are today widely deployed by  dialup  Internet  Service
     Providers,  in order to provide for authentication, authorization, and
     accounting. As a result, the effective management of RADIUS servers is
     of considerable importance.

     4.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

     The  SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major compo-
     nents.  They are:

           o  RFC 1902 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
              describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

           o  RFC 1905 which defines the protocol used for network access to
              managed objects.

           o  RFC 1907 defines the core set of managed objects for the
              Internet suite of protocols.

           o  RFC 1909 which defines the administrative aspects of the
              framework.

     The Framework permits new objects to be defined  for  the  purpose  of
     experimentation and evaluation.


     4.1.  Object Definitions

     Managed  objects  are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information BaseIB.  Objects in  the  MIB  are  defined
     using  the  subset  of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in
     the SMI. In particular, each object object type is named by an  OBJECT
     IDENTIFIER,  an  administratively  assigned  name.   The  object  type
     together with an object instance serves to uniquely  identify  a  spe-
     cific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often use
     a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object  type.


     5.  Overview

     The  RADIUS  protocol, described in [1] and [2], distinguishes between
     the client function and  the  server  function;  RADIUS  clients  send
     requests,  and  RADIUS  servers  reply  to  those  requests. In RADIUS
     authentication, clients send Access-Requests, and servers  reply  with
     Access-Accepts,   Access-Rejects,  and  Access-Challenges.  In  RADIUS
     accounting, clients send Accounting-Requests, and servers  reply  with
     Accounting-Responses. Typically NAS devices implement the client func-
     tion, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS  client  MIB,
     while  RADIUS servers implement the server function, and thus would be
     expected to implement the RADIUS server MIB.

     However, it is possible for a RADIUS entity to perform both client and
     server  functions.  For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as a server to
     one or more RADIUS clients, while simultaneously acting as a client to
     one  or  more  servers. In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS
     entities combining client and server functionality will  support  both
     the client and server MIBs.

     5.1.  Selected objects

     This MIB module contains five scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Client Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS client that the server shares a secret with.

     Each  entry  in the RADIUS Client Table includes eighteen entries pre-
     senting a view of the activity of the RADIUS server.
