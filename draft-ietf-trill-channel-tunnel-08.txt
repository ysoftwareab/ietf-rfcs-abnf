                 TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel Protocol
                <draft-ietf-trill-channel-tunnel-08.txt>


Abstract

   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol includes an optional mechanism (specified in RFC 7178),
   called RBridge Channel, for the transmission of typed messages
   between TRILL switches in the same campus and the transmission of
   such messages between TRILL switches and end stations on the same
   link. This document specifies two optional extensions to the RBridge
   Channel protocol: (1) a standard method to tunnel a variety of
   payload types by encapsulating them in an RBridge Channel message;
   and (2) a method to support security facilities for RBridge Channel
   messages. This document updates RFC 7178.

INTERNET-DRAFT                             TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel


1. Introduction

   The IETF TRILL base protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7780] has been extended
   with the RBridge Channel [RFC7178] facility to support transmission
   of typed messages (for example BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection) [RFC7175]) between two TRILL switches (RBridges) in the
   same campus and the transmission of such messages between RBridges
   and end stations on the same link. When sent between RBridges in the
   same campus, a TRILL Data packet with a TRILL Header is used and the
   destination RBridge is indicated by nickname. When sent between a
   RBridge and an end station on the same link in either direction a
   native RBridge Channel messages [RFC7178] is used with no TRILL
   Header and with the destination port or ports are indicated by a MAC
   address. (There is no mechanism to stop end stations on the same
   link, from sending native RBridge Channel messages to each other;
   however, such use is outside the scope of this document.)

   This document updates [RFC7178] and specifies extensions to RBridge
   Channel that provide two additional facilities as follows:

      (1) A standard method to tunnel a variety of payload types by
          encapsulating them in an RBridge Channel message.

      (2) A method to provide security facilities for RBridge Channel
          messages.

   Use of each of these facilities is optional, except that if Channel
   Tunnel is implemented there are two payload types that MUST be
   implemented. Both of the above facilities can be used in the same
   packet. In case of conflict between this document and [RFC7178], this
   document takes precedence.

2. Channel Tunnel Packet Format

   The general structure of an RBridge Channel message between two TRILL
   switches (RBridges) in the same campus is shown in Figure 2.1 below.
   The structure of a native RBridge Channel message sent between an
   RBridge and an end station on the same link, in either direction, is
   shown in Figure 2.2 and, compared with the first case, omits the
   TRILL Header, inner Ethernet addresses, and Data Label. A Protocol
   field in the RBridge Channel Header gives the type of RBridge Channel
   message and indicates how to interpret the Channel Protocol Specific
   Payload [RFC7178].

   The RBridge Channel Header field specific to the RBridge Channel
   Tunnel Protocol is the Protocol field. Its contents MUST be the value
   allocated for this purpose (see Section 6).

   The RBridge Channel Tunnel Protocol Specific Data fields are as
   follows:

      SubERR: This field provides further details when a Channel Tunnel
         error is indicated in the RBridge Channel ERR field. If ERR is
         zero, then SubERR MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.
         See Section 5.

INTERNET-DRAFT                             TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel


      RESV4: This field MUST be sent as zero. If non-zero when received,
         this is an error condition (see Section 5).

      SType: This field describes the type of security information and
         features, including keying material, being used or provided by
         the Channel Tunnel packet. See Section 4.

      PType: Payload type. This describes the tunneled data. See Section
         3 below.

      Security Information: Variable length information. Length is zero
         if SType is zero. See Section 4.

   The Channel Tunnel protocol is integrated with the RBridge Channel
   facility.  Channel Tunnel errors are reported as if they were RBridge
   Channel errors, using newly allocated code points in the ERR field of
   the RBridge Channel Header supplemented by the SubERR field.

3. Channel Tunnel Payload Types

   The Channel Tunnel Protocol can carry a variety of payloads as
   indicated by the PType field. Values are shown in the table below
   with further explanation after the table.

         PType  Section  Description
         -----  -------  -----------
            0             Reserved
            1     3.1     Null
            2     3.2     Ethertyped Payload
            3     3.3     Ethernet Frame
         4-14             Unassigned
           15             Reserved

                       Table 3.1 Payload Type Values

   While implementation of the Channel Tunnel protocol is optional, if
   it is implemented PType 1 (Null) MUST be implemented and PType 2
   (Ethertyped Payload) with the RBridge Channel Ethertype MUST be
   implemented.  PType 2 for any Ethertypes other than the RBridge
   Channel Ethertype MAY be implemented. PType 3 MAY be implemented.

   The processing of any particular Channel Protocol message and its
   payload depends on meeting local security and other policy at the
   destination TRILL switch or end station.



3.1 Null Payload

   The Null payload type (PType = 1) is intended to be used for testing
   or for messages such as key negotiation or the like where only
   security information is present. It indicates that there is no
   payload. Any data after the Security Information field is ignored. If
   the Channel Tunnel feature is implemented, Null Payload MUST be
   supported in the sense that an "Unsupported PType" error is not
   returned (see Section 5). Any particular use of the Null Payload
   should specify what VLAN or priority should be used when relevant.



3.2 Ethertyped Payload

   A PType of 2 indicates that the payload of the Channel Tunnel message
   begins with an Ethertype. A TRILL switch supporting the Channel
   Tunnel protocol MUST support a PType of 2 with a payload beginning
   with the RBridge Channel Ethertype as describe in Section 3.2.1.
   Other Ethertypes, including the TRILL and L2-IS-IS Ethertypes as
   described in Section 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, MAY be supported.

INTERNET-DRAFT                             TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel


3.2.1 Tunneled RBridge Channel Message

   A PType of 2 with an initial RBridge Channel Ethertype indicates an
   encapsulated RBridge Channel message payload. A typical reason for
   sending an RBridge Channel message inside a Channel Tunnel message is
   to provide security services, such as authentication or encryption.

   This payload type looks like the following:

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

           Figure 3.1 Tunneled RBridge Channel Message Structure



3.2.2 Tunneled TRILL Data Packet

   A PType of 2 and an initial TRILL Ethertype indicates that the
   payload of the Tunnel protocol message is an encapsulated TRILL Data
   packet as shown in the figure below.  If this Ethertype is supported
   for PType = 2 and the message meets local policy for acceptance, the
   tunneled TRILL Data packet is handled as if it had been received by
   the destination TRILL switch on the port where the Channel Tunnel
   message was received.

3.2.3 Tunneled TRILL IS-IS Packet

   A PType of 2 and an initial L2-IS-IS Ethertype indicates that the
   payload of the Tunnel protocol message is an encapsulated TRILL IS-IS
   PDU as shown in Figure 3.3. If this Ethertype is supported for PType
   = 2, the tunneled TRILL IS-IS packet is processed by the destination
   RBridge if it meets local policy. One possible use is to expedite the
   receipt of a link state PDU (LSP) by some TRILL switch or switches
   with an immediate requirement for the link state information.  A link
   local IS-IS PDU (Hello, CSNP, or PSNP [IS-IS]; MTU-probe or MTU-ack
   [RFC7176]; or circuit scoped FS-LSP, FS-CSNP or FS-PSNP [RFC7356])
   would not normally be sent via this Channel Tunnel method except
   possibly to encrypt it since such PDUs can just be transmitted on the
   link and do not normally need RBridge Channel tunneling.

3.3 Ethernet Frame

   If PType is 3, the Tunnel Protocol payload is an Ethernet frame as
   might be received from or sent to an end station except that the
   tunneled Ethernet frame's FCS is omitted, as shown in Figure 3.4.
   (There is still an overall final FCS if the RBridge Channel message
   is being sent on an Ethernet link.) If this PType is implemented and
   the message meets local policy, the tunneled frame is handled as if
   it had been received on the port on which the Channel Tunnel message
   was received.

   The priority of the RBridge Channel message can be copied from the
   Ethernet frame VLAN tag, if one is present, except that priority 7
   SHOULD only be used for messages critical to establishing or
   maintaining adjacency and priority 6 SHOULD only be used for other
   important control messages.

   In the case of a non-Ethernet link, such as a PPP (Point-to-Point
   Protocol) link [RFC6361], the ports on the link are considered to
   have link local synthetic 48-bit MAC addresses constructed as
   described below.  These constructed addresses MAY be used as a MacSA.
   If the RBridge Channel message is link local, the source TRILL switch
   will have the information to construct such a MAC address for the
   destination TRILL switch port and that MAC address MAY be used as the
   MacDA. By the use of such a MacSA and either such a unicast MacDA or
   a group addressed MacDA, an Ethernet frame can be sent between two
   TRILL switch ports connected by a non-Ethernet link.

   These synthetic TRILL switch port MAC addresses for non-Ethernet
   ports are constructed as follows: 0xFEFF, the nickname of the TRILL
   switch used in TRILL Hellos sent on that port, and the Port ID that
   the TRILL switch has assigned to that port, as shown in Figure 3.5.
   (Both the Port ID of the port on which a TRILL Hello is sent and the
   nickname of the sending TRILL switch appear in the Special VLANs and
   Flags sub-TLV [RFC7176] in TRILL IS-IS Hellos.)  The resulting MAC
   address has the Local bit on and the Group bit off [RFC7042].
   However, since there will be no Ethernet end stations on a non-
   Ethernet link in a TRILL campus, such synthetic MAC addresses cannot
   conflict on the link with a real Ethernet port address.

4. Security, Keying, and Algorithms

   Table 4.1 below gives the assigned values of the SType field and
   their meaning. Use of DTLS Pairwise Security (SType = 2) is
   RECOMMENDED.  While [RFC5310] based authentication applies to both
   pairwise and multi-destination traffic, it provides only
   authentication and is generally considered not to met current
   security standards, as it does not provide for key negotiation; thus,
   its use is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Channel Tunnel DTLS based security specified in Section 4.6 below is
   intended for pairwise (known unicast) use in which case the M bit in
   the TRILL Header would be zero and in the native RBridge Channel case
   (Figure 2.2) the Outer.MacDA would be individually addressed.

   Multi-destination Channel Tunnel packets would be those with the M
   bit in the TRILL Header set to one or, in the native RBridge Channel
   case, the Outer.MacDA would be group addressed. However, the DTLS
   Pairwise Security SType can be used in the multi-destination case by
   serially unicasting the messages to all data accessible RBridges (or
   end stations in the native RBridge Channel case) in the recipient
   group. For TRILL Data packets, that group is specified by the Data
   Label; for native frames, the group is specified by the groupcast
   destination MAC address. It is intended to specify a true group keyed
   SType to secure multi-destination packets in a separate document
   [GroupKey].

4.1 Basic Security Information Format

   When SType is zero, there is no Security Information after the
   Channel Tunnel header and before the payload.  For all SType values
   except zero, the Security Information starts with four reserved flag
   bits and twelve bits of remaining length as follows:

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...

                  Figure 4.1 Security Information Format

   The fields are as follows:

   RESV: Four reserved bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on
      receipt. In the future, meanings may be assigned to these bits and
      those meanings may differ for different STypes.

   Size: The number of bytes, as an unsigned integer, of More Info in
      the Security Information after the Size byte itself. Thus the
      maximum possible length of Security Information is 4,097 bytes for
      a Size of 4,095 plus 2 for the RESV and Size fields.

   More Info: Additional Security Information of length Size. Contents
      depends on the SType.



4.2 Authentication and Encryption Coverage

   As show in Figure 4.2, the area covered by Channel Tunnel
   authentication starts with the byte immediately after the TRILL
   Header optional Flag Word if it is present. Otherwise, it starts
   after the TRILL Header Ingress Nickname. In either case, it extends
   to just before the TRILL Data packet link trailer.  For example, for
   an Ethernet packet it would extend to just before the FCS.

   TRILL Data packet link trailer (see Figures 4.2 and 4.3).



4.3 Derived Keying Material

   In some cases, it is possible to use material derived from [RFC5310]
   IS-IS keying material as an element of Channel Tunnel security. In
   such cases, the More Info field shown in Figure 4.1 includes the two
   byte IS-IS Key ID to identify the keying material. It is assumed that
   the IS-IS keying material is of high quality. The material actually
   used in Channel Tunnel security is derived from the IS-IS keying
   material as follows:

      Derived Material =
         HKDF-Expand-SHA256 ( IS-IS-key, "Channel Tunnel" | 0x0S, L )

   where "|" indicates concatenation, HKDF is as in [RFC5869], SHA256 is
   as in [RFC6234], IS-IS-key is the input IS-IS keying material,
   "Channel Tunnel" is the 14-character ASCII [RFC20] string indicated
   without any leading length byte or trailing zero byte, 0x0S is a
   single byte where S is the SType for which this key derivation is
   being used and the upper nibble is zero, and L is the length of
   output-derived material needed.

   Whenever IS-IS keying material is being used as above, the underlying
   [RFC5310] keying material might expire or become invalidated. At the
   time of or before such expiration or invalidation, the use Derived
   Material from the IS-IS keying material MUST cease. Continued
   security may depend on using new derived material from currently
   valid [RFC5310] keying material.



4.4 SType None

   No security services are being invoked. The length of the Security
   Information field (see Figure 2.4) is zero.



4.5 RFC 5310 Based Authentication

   The Security Information (see Figure 2.4) is the RESV and Size fields
   specified in Section 4.1 with the value of the [RFC5310] Key ID and
   Authentication Data, as shown in Figure 4.4.

   o  Key ID: specifies the keying value and authentication algorithm
      that the Key ID specifies for TRILL IS-IS LSP [RFC5310]
      Authentication TLVs. The keying material actually used is derived
      as shown in Section 4.3.

   o  Authentication Data: The authentication data produced by the
      derived key and algorithm associated with the Key ID acting on the
      packet as specified in Section 4.2. Length of the authentication
      data depends on the algorithm.

   While RBridges, which are IS-IS routers, can reasonable be expected
   to hold [RFC5310] keying, so that this SType can be used for RBridge
   Channel messages, how end stations might come to hold [rfc5310]
   keying is beyond the scope of this document. Thus this SType might
   not be applicable to native RBridge Channel messages.



4.6 DTLS Pairwise Security

   DTLS supports key negotiation and provides both encryption and
   authentication. The Channel Tunnel DTLS [RFC6347] SType uses a
   negotiated DTLS version that MUST NOT be less than 1.2.

   When DTLS pairwise security is used, the entire payload of the
   Channel Tunnel packet, starting just after the Security Information
   and ending just before the link trailer, is one or more DTLS records
   [RFC6347].  As specified in [RFC6347], DTLS records MUST be limited
   by the path MTU, in this case so each record fits entirely within a
   single Channel Tunnel message. A minimum path MTU can be determined


D. Eastlake, M. Umair, & Y. Li                                 [Page 18]

INTERNET-DRAFT                             TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel


   from the TRILL campus wide minimum MTU Sz, which will not be less
   than 1470 bytes, by allowing for the TRILL Data packet, Channel
   Tunnel, and DTLS framing overhead.  With this SType, the security
   information provided before the DTLS record(s) is 0, as shown in
   Figure 4.5, because all the security information is in the payload
   area.

   The DTLS Pairwise keying is set up between a pair of RBridges
   independent of Data Label using messages of a priority configurable
   at the RBridge level which defaults to priority 6. DTLS messages
   other than application_data can be encapsulated in the Channel Tunnel
   protocol with a TRILL Header using any Data Label. Actual
   application_data sent with Channel Tunnel using this SType should use
   the Data Label and priority as specified for that application_data.
   The PType indicates the nature of the application_data.

   TRILL switches that support the Channel Tunnel DTLS SType MUST
   support the use of pre-shared keys for DTLS. If the psk_identity (see
   [RFC4279]) is two bytes, it represents, as a pre-shared key to be
   used in the DTLS negotiation, the value derived as shown in Section
   4.3 from the key associated with that psk_identity as a [RFC5310] Key
   ID. A psk_identity with a length other than two bytes MAY be used to
   indicate other implementation dependent pre-shared keys.

      results in a return RBridge Channel message with a non-zero ERR
      field,
   then that returned message SHOULD also be nested in an Channel Tunnel
   message using the same type of security. In this case, the ERR field
   in the Channel Tunnel envelope is set to 8 indicating that there is a
   nested error in the message being tunneled back.

6. IANA Considerations

   This section lists IANA Considerations.



6.1 Channel Tunnel RBridge Channel Protocol Number

   IANA is requested to assign TBD as the RBridge Channel protocol
   number for the "Channel Tunnel" protocol from the range assigned by
   Standards Action.

   The added RBridge Channel protocols registry entry on the TRILL
   Parameters web page is as follows:

         Protocol  Description       Reference
         --------  --------------    ------------------
            TBD    Channel Tunnel    [this document]



6.2 RBridge Channel Error Codes Subregistry

   IANA is requested to create a "RBridge Channel Error Codes"
   subregistry under the "RBridge Channel Protocols" registry. The
   header information is as follows:

   Registration Procedures: IETF Review References: [RFC7178] [this
   document]

   The subregistry is to have columns and entries as follows:

      Code   Meaning   Reference
      ----   -------   ---------
      [populate rows for codes 0 through 5 from Section xxx of
             [RFC7178] with reference [RFC7178] ]
      [populate rows for codes 6 through 8 from Table 5.1 of this
             document with reference [this document] ]
      9-15   Unassigned
        16   Reserved

7. Security Considerations

   The RBridge Channel Tunnel facility has potentially positive and
   negative effects on security.

   On the positive side, it provides optional security that can be used
   to authenticate and/or encrypt RBridge Channel messages. Some RBridge
   Channel message payloads, such as BFD [RFC7175], provide their own
   security but where this is not true, consideration should be given,
   when specifying an RBridge Channel protocol, to recommending or
   requiring use of the security features of the Channel Tunnel
   protocol.

   On the negative side, the optional ability to tunnel various payload
   types and to tunnel them between TRILL switches and to and from end
   stations can increase risk unless precautions are taken.  The
   processing of decapsulating Tunnel Protocol payloads is not a good
   place to be liberal in what you accept. This is because the tunneling
   facility makes it easier for unexpected messages to pop up in
   unexpected places in a TRILL campus due to accidents or the actions
   of an adversary. Local policies should generally be strict and only
   process payload types required and then only with adequate
   authentication for the particular circumstances.

   See the first paragraph of Section 4 for recommendations on SType
   usage.  See [RFC7457] for Security Considerations of DTLS for
   security.

   If IS-IS authentication is not being used, then [RFC5310] keying
   information would not normally be available but that presumably
   represents a judgment by the TRILL campus operator that no security
   is needed.

   See [RFC7178] for general RBridge Channel Security Considerations and
   [RFC6325] for general TRILL Security Considerations.
