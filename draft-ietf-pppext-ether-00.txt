Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC-1661] provides a standard
   method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
   links.  This document describes the use of ethernet-like framing for
   PPP encapsulated packets.

1.  Introduction

   This specification provides for framing over both bit-oriented and
   octet-oriented synchronous links, and asynchronous links with 8 bits
   of data and no parity.  These links MUST be full-duplex, but MAY be
   either dedicated or circuit-switched.

   Some protocols expect error free transmission, and either provide
   error detection only on a conditional basis, or do not provide it at
   all.  PPP uses the Ethernet 32-bit Frame Check Sequence for error
   detection.  This is commonly available in hardware implementations,
   and a software implementation is provided in [RFC-1662].


1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC-2119].

   To remain consistent with standard Internet practice, and avoid con-
   fusion for people used to reading RFCs, all binary numbers in the
   following descriptions are in Most Significant Bit to Least Signifi-
   cant Bit order, from Most Significant Byte to Least Significant Byte,
   reading from left to right, unless otherwise indicated.  Note that
   this is contrary to ISO and ITU practice, which orders bits as trans-
   mitted (network bit order).  Keep this in mind when comparing this
   document with the other documents.


2.  Physical Layer Requirements

   The only absolute requirement imposed by PPP is the provision of a
   bi-directional full-duplex circuit, either dedicated (permanent) or
   frame-switched, that can operate in either a bit-synchronous, or
   octet-synchronous mode, transparent to PPP Data Link Layer frames.

   Interface Format

      PPP presents an octet interface to the physical layer.  There is
      no provision for sub-octets to be supplied or accepted.

   Transmission Rate

      PPP does not impose any restrictions regarding transmission rate,
      other than that of the particular DTE/DCE interface.

   Control Signals

      PPP does not require the use of control signals.  When available,
      using such signals can allow greater functionality and perfor-
      mance.  Implications are discussed in [RFC-1662].


   2.1.  Transmission Considerations

      The definition of various encodings is the responsibility of the
      DTE/DCE equipment in use, and is outside the scope of this speci-
      fication.


   3.  The Data Link Layer

      This specification uses the principles, terminology, and frame
      structure described in [IEEE-802?].

      The purpose of this specification is not to document what is
      already standardized in [IEEE-802?].  Instead, this document
      attempts to give a concise summary and point out specific options
      and features used by PPP.


   3.1.  Frame Header

      This specification describes the PPP Protocol encapsulation.
      These fields are transmitted from left to right.

      |             Length            |         PPP Protocol          |

      The PPP Protocol field and the following Information and Padding
      fields are described in the Point-to-Point Protocol Encapsulation
      [RFC-1661].

   3.2.  Modification of the Basic Frame

      The Link Control Protocol can negotiate modifications to the basic
      frame structure.  This is not compatible with ethernet-like fram-
      ing.

      Address-and-Control-Field-Compression

         Since the Address and Control fields are not present, Address-
         and-Control-Field-Compression cannot affect the frame format.

      FCS-Alternatives

         Since ethernet-like framing requires a 32-bit FCS, FCS-
         Alternatives cannot affect the frame format.

      In general, framing-related LCP Configuration Options are not rec-
      ognizable, and are not acceptable for negotiation.  The implemen-
      tation MUST NOT send ineffectual options in a Configure-Request,
      and SHOULD respond to such requested options with a Configure-
      Reject.  See [RFC-ffff] for details.


   3.3.  Modification of the Basic Packet

      The Link Control Protocol can negotiate modifications to the basic
      packet structure.  These are transparent to Frame Relay.

      Protocol-Field-Compression

         The fixed header aligns the PPP Information field on a 32-bit
         boundary.  The implementation MUST respond with a Configure-
         Reject.

      Self-Describing-Padding

         Negotiation of Self-Describing-Padding to a 4-byte multiple is
         required.


   4.  Configuration Details

      The standard LCP configuration defaults apply to ethernet-like
      framing, except that 32-bit FCS is assumed (instead of 16-bit
      FCS).

      The following Configuration Options are recommended:

         Magic Number
         No Address and Control Field Compression
         No Protocol Field Compression
         Link Quality Monitoring
         Self Describing Padding


   Security Considerations

      This specification introduces no known security vulnerabilities.

      Lothberg (Sprint).
