1. The SNMP Network Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework consists of five major components. An 
   overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2]. 
    
   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, 
   RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].  The second 
   version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [6], STD 58, 
   RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8]. 
    
   Message protocols for transferring management information. The first 
   version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second version of the SNMP 
   message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, 
   is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC 1906 [11].  
   The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
   described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574 [13]. 
    
   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first 
   set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in 
   STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol operations and 
   associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [14]. 
    
   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and the 
   view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [16]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo does not specify a MIB module.

Internet Draft       Protocol identifiers for IPv6            June 2003 
                                      
                                      
   Despite IPv6 is operational there are no protocol identifiers to 
   extend the use of RMON MIBs and of the IPPM REPORTING MIB to IPv6. 
   This memo defines basis protocol identifiers for IP Version 6 and sub 
   IP.  
    
   The "Remote Network Monitoring MIB Protocol Identifier Macros" 
   [RFC2896], defines various protocol identifiers. The syntax of the 
   protocol identifier descriptor is defined in the RMON Protocol 
   Identifier Reference [rfc2895]. The reader should be familiar with 
   these documents. 
    
   The intend of this document is not to adapt to IP Version 6 the 
   protocol identifiers defined in the RFC 2896 and the RFC 2895, but to 
   define protocol identifiers for IP Version 6 protocols and for sub IP 
   protocols. 
    
3. Relationship to the Remote Network Monitoring MIB 
    
   RMON MIB implementations use protocol identifiers to describe 
   unambiguous capabilities in protocolDirTable entries. 
    
4. Relationship to the IPPM REPORTING MIB 
    
   The typeP defined in the IPPM framework [RFC2330] is a generic type 
   of packet. Consequently it corresponds to any valid protocol 
   encapsulation. 
    
   The IPPM REPORTING MIB implements the Type-P using protocol 
   identifiers' names defined in [RFC2895] and [RFC2896]. An instance of 
   the TypeP is the description of a pair made of any valid protocols 
   encapsulation (TypeP) and of corresponding protocol parameters 
   (TypePaddress): 
      + TypeP is a human readable string made of the list of protocol 
   identifiers' names of the encapsulation; 
      + TypePaddress is a human readable string made of the list of 
   protocol parameters values. Each value is represented using its 
   protocol convention ('.' For IPv4, ':' for IPv6 ...). 
    
    
   Example: 
    
   A valid pair of <TypeP, TypePaddress> is 
        <"ip udp", "192.168.0.1 3485">. 
    
   As this memo defines a protocol identifier for IP version 6 named 
   'ip6'. A valid pair is  
        <"ip6 udp", "2001:688:1f9b:7654:3210:b3ff:feab:3456 3485">. 
    
5. Relationship to passive measurement

   IPFIX and PSAMP filtering may use protocol identifiers as unambiguous 
   keywords to describe the protocol suites to filter on, the flow to 
   meter. 
    
6. MPLS layer protocol identifiers 
    
   There is need to define protocol identifiers for MPLS to provide 
   unambiguous names to distinguish a trunk from a LSP, an IPv4 LSP from 
   an IPv6 one.

   This memo does not specify metrics implementation nor measurements 
   implementation, so it does not directly affect the security of the 
   Internet nor of applications that run on the Internet. However, usage 
   of protocol identifiers to describe measurement configurations must 
   be mindful of security and privacy concerns. 
 
9.1. Privacy 
    
   As passive measurement make use of customer data, care should be 
   taken to respect local privacy laws regarding privacy. 
 
9.2. Active Measurement aspects 
    
   As detailed in the security section of the RFC2681 [18], active 
   measurement may introduce dysfunction due to the packets injected and 
   moreover theses packets may alter the results. Consequently a 
   security policy should be applied to avoid measurement systems to be 
   used to injected traffic attacks. 
    
9.3. Passive Measurement aspects 
    
   The management plane of passive measurements system could be harmed 
   by attackers injecting artificial traffic that overflowed either the 
   management network or collectors' databases and memories.  
    
   The measurement plane of passive measurements system could be harmed 
   by attackers injecting artificial traffic that overflowed buffers 
   inside measurement points.  
 
9.4. Management aspects 
    
   As protocol identifiers may be used to describe passive or active 
   measurement it is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms 
   (for authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
