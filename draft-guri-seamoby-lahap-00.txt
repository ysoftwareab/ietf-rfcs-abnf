Abstract

   This document introduces a new paging protocol nick-named
   "LAHAP", which makes use of layer 2 triggers to anticipate
   events related to paging in layer 2. LAHAP uses the
   architectural entities defined in RFC 3154 to support dormant
   mode in hosts connected to the Internet. LAHAP is not dependent
   on any mobility protocol. Tracking agent keeps track of the
   paging area of the HOST using layer 2 triggers. Dormant
   monitoring agent intercepts the traffic for the node and queries
   tracking agent for the last registered paging area. Dormant
   monitoring agent asks paging agent to page the host. The paging
   is done in the paging areas if available and on the subnet. The
   host deregisters its paging registration after entering into the
   active mode.

1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in RFC-2119 [4].

   DMA
   The Dormant Monitoring Agent is an Internet node, which detects
   the delivery of packets to a Host that is in Dormant Mode. Once
   a routable connection to the Host is created, the Dormant
   Monitoring Agent arranges for delivery of the packet to the
   Host. [1]

   TA
   The Tracking Agent is responsible for tracking a Host's location
   while it is in dormant mode or active mode, and for determining
   when Host enters inactive mode. There is a one to one mapping
   between a Host and a Tracking Agent.

   PA
   The Paging Agent is responsible for alerting the Host when a
   packet arrives and the Host is in dormant mode. [1]

   HOST
   HOST refers to IPv6 node, which supports dormant mode operation.

   Paging area
   Collection of radio access points that is signaled to locate a
   dormant mode HOST.  A paging area does not necessarily
   correspond to an IP subnet. [3]

   Paging Area Multicast Address

   If Layer 3 paging areas are supported then the tracking agents
   are organized in the form of paging areas. Each region may have
   one or more paging areas indicated by PA1, PA2, ‡, PAn. The
   tracking agents in paging area i are members of the paging area
   multicast address (PAMAi). A paging area multicast address is an
   IPv6 multicast address which is permanently assigned and is of
   global scope.

2. Protocol

   This protocol is a network layer protocol for paging. Protocol
   allows arbitrary mapping between paging areas and IP subnets.
   Dormant monitoring agent (DMA) maintains binding cache required
   to page and forward traffic to a dormant host (HOST). HOST sends
   updates to tracking agent, which caches the paging area in which
   the HOST is located.

   Whenever HOST enters dormant mode, it registers with DMA. HOST
   registers paging area ID of its visited network with DMA.
   The host gets the paging area ID from Layer 2 by way of triggers
   (see Section 2.4).  DMA intercepts traffic for HOST. As soon as
   DMA detects traffic for HOST, DMA sends paging request to the
   paging agent. The destination of paging request is paging agent.
   Paging request contains HOST's home address. Dormant mode host
   is paged. HOST comes back to active mode and sends dormant mode
   deregistration message to DMA. Paging agent sends paging reply
   to DMA. Paging reply contains the result of paging of HOST. HOST
   MAY obtain IP address using address auto-configuration.

   Whenever HOST changes paging area, the host and the tracking
   agent are notified using layer 2 triggers. As long as HOST
   remains in dormant mode, tracking agent has exact information
   about the paging area in which the HOST is located. When DMA
   detects traffic for HOST, DMA MAY send a tracking request
   message, a datagram with destination options extension header,
   to tracking agent. Tracking agent replies with the tracking
   reply message which contains the identification of paging area
   in which the host is located. DMA maps paging area ID with
   paging agent's address to identify the paging agent and sends
   paging request to the paging agent. Paging agent pages the HOST
   by  multicasting the paging request in paging area. HOST replies
   to DMA by sending "dormant mode deregistration" message.

   If HOST is not detected by paging, paging agent informs DMA in
   the paging reply that HOST has not responded to paging. DMA
   sends ICMP_HOST_UNREACHABLE message to the node, which is trying
   to deliver datagrams to the host. Even if tracking agent doesn't
   respond to "tracking request", DMA sends "ICMP HOST UNREACHABLE"
   message to the node which is trying to deliver datagrams to the
   host.

   When HOST changes paging area, paging area trigger is sent up to
   layer 3 at tracking agent. The trigger contains information
   about the new paging area ID of the host. Tracking agent caches
   the paging area ID supplied in the trigger.

   Tracking agent is located on the subnet to which the host is
   connected. The subnet also has a router marked as access router
   (AR) in Figure 1. HOST is pre-configured with DMA's address.

2.1. When HOST enters dormant mode

   The dormant mode host registers with DMA before entering dormant
   mode. The host MUST send a dormant mode registration message to
   DMA. Dormant mode registration message is an IPv6 datagram with
   destination option extension header. The source address is
   HOST's registered IPv6 address and the destination address is
   DMA's IP address. The destination option contains the paging
   area ID, lifetime of the registration, the host∆s IPv6 address

                             Lahap               September 2001

   and dormant mode registration options. The options specify the
   traffic intended to be received by HOST while in dormant mode.
   Lifetime in the request specifies the time in seconds for which
   HOST wants the registration to be valid. The lifetime field
   specified in the reply may be equal to or less than that
   specified in the request because of DMA's considerations. DMA
   may limit lifetime due to various considerations like its
   computing capability and current load. If lifetime field is set
   to zero it indicates the registration has failed.

   The messages defined here contain a header with type, code and
   the sequence number. Sequence numbers for the requests start
   from zero. Sequence numbers for subsequent requests are
   incremented by one for each request. The sequence number in the
   reply matches the one in the corresponding request. If no reply
   is received within a timeout period then the host MUST
   retransmit the registration request message.

2.2. Forwarding traffic to a dormant HOST

   As soon as HOST registers with DMA, DMA starts intercepting the
   traffic for HOST. DMA checks options specified by HOST in the
   registrations. When DMA detects any traffic intended to be
   received by HOST, DMA MAY send the tracking request message to
   TA, if HOST has moved while in dormant mode. The tracking
   request contains HOST's IP address. TA MUST reply with a
   tracking reply message. Tracking reply contains HOST's last
   registered paging area ID and the mode of the host. The source
   address and destination addresses of tracking reply are TA and
   DMA respectively. If TA replies that HOST is in inactive mode,
   DMA sends ICMP_HOST_UNREACHABLE message to the node, which is
   trying to communicate with HOST. Otherwise, DMA MUST send a
   paging request message to paging agent.

   Paging agent multicasts paging request to all routers multicast
   address in its paging area. The host is paged using L2 paging
   means or time-slot paging.

   HOST replies to DMA with dormant mode deregistration message.
   Deregistration message is a dormant mode registration message
   with lifetime field set to zero. Also the host sends its new
   IPv6 address in the visited network. DMA forwards the traffic to
   HOST.

2.3. When HOST changes from dormant to active mode

   When HOST comes back to active mode, HOST invalidates its
   registration with DMA. HOST invalidates registration by sending
   a new registration message with lifetime of zero. After the
   registration is invalidated, DMA stops intercepting the packets
   for HOST. All fields of registration and invalidation message
   are the same except the lifetime field. The TA address field in

                             Lahap               September 2001

   the registration message is set to zero. In active mode, the
   behavior of the protocol is the same as in the underlying
   network protocol.

2.4. Triggers for paging

   Some earlier Internet drafts defined triggers related to handoff
   [2]. This protocol defines triggers related to dormant mode
   operation of a host in Internet. This protocol takes advantage
   of triggers from layer-2 at access router and HOST.

2.4.1. Paging area trigger

   Whenever HOST changes layer 2 paging area, trigger paging area
   is sent up to layer-3 at HOST. This trigger is also sent when
   the host is powered on. The trigger contains the paging area ID.

   The trigger is also available at TA. TA upon receiving this
   trigger MUST update binding cache. This trigger helps tracking
   agent to have updated information about the paging area of the
   HOST.

2.4.2. New paging mode trigger

   Whenever HOST changes mode from active to dormant, HOST performs
   dormant mode registration with DMA. However this registration
   would not be needed if new paging mode trigger could be used.
   This trigger issued at DMA could serve as the reception of the

                             Lahap               September 2001

   paging registration request packet from the host. DMA replies
   with dormant mode registration reply.
   When host enters inactive mode the trigger is issued at TA. TA
   MUST remove the host from its binding cache.

2.4.3. Dormant HOST not reachable trigger

   When HOST is paged in a layer 2 paging area and HOST is not
   found, this information is passed to the layer 3 at the paging
   agent by using a trigger from layer 2. The PA MUST send paging
   reply message back to DMA in which the result field is set to
   zero and IP address is set to the host∆s IPv6 address.

2.4.4. Dormant HOST reachable trigger

   If HOST responds to paging, the trigger "Dormant HOST reachable"
   is sent up to layer 3 at paging agent. This trigger helps paging
   agent to determine whether HOST has responded to paging or not.
   The paging agent MUST send paging reply message to DMA with
   result field set to 1 and IP address is set to the host∆s IPv6
   address.

2.5. Binding cache maintained by agents

   HOST and the agents need to maintain some state about the
   dormant mode of the HOST. They need to remember the status of
   HOST, number of messages sent to HOST. DMA needs to maintain in
   its binding cache whether HOST is in dormant mode or in active
   mode. DMA caches HOST's address, its tracking agent address, its
   paging area ID and its paging options. Since multiple HOSTS may
   share a single DMA, DMA needs to maintain a binding cache for
   each HOST. Tracking agent caches HOST's IP address and its layer
   2 paging area ID, if layer 2 paging is supported. All the
   binding registrations have a lifetime, which specifies the time
   in seconds after which the respective registration expires.

2.6. Mapping between paging areas and IP subnets

   This protocol allows arbitrary mapping between IP subnets and
   paging areas.

2.6.1. When multiple paging areas are part of a single subnet

   When multiple paging areas are part of a single IP subnet
   i.e. layer 2 paging areas are supported, tracking agent will
   request layer 2 entities in its area to start layer 2 paging.
   When the HOST changes paging area, information is passed to
   TA using the layer 2 trigger of paging area of Section 2.4.1.
   So, tracking agent has exact information of which paging area
   the HOST is located. When the HOST changes the subnet, it
   selects new TA. HOST registers new TA's address with DMA.

                             Lahap               September 2001

2.6.2. When multiple subnets are part of a single paging area

   When multiple subnets are part of a single paging area i.e.
   layer 3 paging areas are supported, a paging request message
   is multicast to the paging area multicast address. All the
   tracking agents in that paging area become members of the
   multicast group. This paging request in turn will start layer
   2 paging of the HOST in all the subnets, which are part of
   that paging area. After the HOST replies to the layer 2
   paging, a paging reply message is delivered to PA by each
   tracking agent. HOST replies with dormant mode deregistration
   message to DMA.

   Paging agent receives paging reply messages from the tracking
   agent(s). If at least of  the replies has the result field
   set to one then the paging has succeeded. Otherwise PA may
   continue to page in other paging areas or MAY declare the
   host inaccessible. Paging agent MUST send paging reply
   message to DMA, reporting the result of paging.

2.7. Time slotted paging

   If there is L2 support for paging then on-link paging is used
   as described in Section 2.8. It is assumed that if there is
   no L2 support for paging on the subnet, the underlying
   network supports time slotted paging. In this case the
   tracking agent takes care of the paging on the subnet. After
   receiving the paging request message from the Paging Agent,
   tracking agent pages the HOST by periodically sending router
   advertisement messages. HOST then replies to the DMA with
   dormant mode deregistration message.

2.8.On-link paging

   L2 paging is triggered by sending an on-link paging message.
   On-link paging message is an IPv6 datagram with destination
   option extension header. The tracking agent sets the
   destination address of the message to the HOST's link local
   address. On-link paging message MUST be sent by the tracking
   agent only once. This message will trigger L2 paging on the
   link which will eventually wake up the host. Tracking agent
   replies to paging agent by sending a paging reply message
   with the result of paging.

   HOST responds to on-link paging with dormant mode
   deregistration message. The sequence number in dormant mode
   deregistration is obtained by incrementing sequence number in
   the on-link paging message.

   - HOST IP address: HOST's home address registered with DMA.
   i.e. The address for which it wants DMA to intercept the
   traffic
   - TA IP address: Address of tracking agent, with which HOST
   has a valid registration. i.e. A registration whose lifetime
   has not expired
   - Lifetime specifies the time in seconds for which HOST wants
   DMA to keep the binding cache intact
   - Paging area ID is valid only when HOST is registering for
   the first time. When HOST registers for the first time, TA IP
   address field is invalid. In subsequent registrations, TA IP
   address field is valid, but paging area ID field is not
   valid.

   Options define the types of traffic for which DMA should
   inform HOST. The bits of options field from left to right
   (first to last) are defined as follows:

   0 -> If bit number 0 =1, HOST wishes to receive traffic for
   unicast address registered with HOST
   1 -> If bit number 1 =1, HOST wishes to receive broadcast
   traffic on the local subnet

4. Security issues

   Section 3.1 in [1] discusses denial of service amplification.
   An attacker can exploit paging protocol by sending large
   number of packets by using bogus correspondent nodes and
   unnecessarily forcing HOST to enter active mode. Since the
   filtering of incoming traffic is done at DMA in our protocol,
   the problem of DoS generated by correspondent nodes in
   Internet reduces to the problem of solving it for ordinary
   Internet hosts. The problem of "bogus IP packets" can be
   solved by any existing security architectures like ingress
   filtering, IP spoofing and IPSec.

   [1] outlines a number of possible security vulnerabilities of
   an IP paging protocol. The vast majority of these attacks are
   prevented if all paging traffic is protected by an IPsec
   security association (SA).

   One category of attacks is DoS Amplification attack of
   section 3.1 in [1], in which bogus paging requests are wide
   casted across the network. This attack is prevented by taking
   advantage of the source authentication which IPsec provides.
   With IPsec, only authorized and authenticated nodes can
   initiate paging. If an authenticated node misbehaves then it
   can be removed from the list of authorized users. IPsec
   source authentication also solves the Queue Overflow attack
   of section 3.2 in [1].

   The remaining problems are the Bogus Paging Area and Forced
   Battery Consumption attacks described in section 3.3 of [1].
   This protocol does not fully solve the Bogus Paging Area
   problem because we believe that the problem is not solvable
   without a large-scale PKI and extremely precise clock
   synchronization. An attacker could simply take the paging
   messages from one area and rebroadcast them in another area.

   As for the Forced Battery Consumption attack, there are
   several reasonable solutions to this problem:

   1) On Demand Negotiation: SAs are negotiated on demand
   (whenever the host is paged or when it crosses a paging area
   boundary).

   2) Perpetual Connectivity: Before a host enters dormant mode,
   it ensures that it has an SA with the PA and/or the tracking
   router.

   3) Signed Paging Messages: SAs are negotiated on demand, but
   only upon reception of a cryptographically signed paging
   request (signed with the DMA's public key).

   4) A hybrid of the above methods.

   In order to leverage the existing framework for negotiating
   IPsec SAs, we use a hybrid of solutions 1 and 2. Since it is
   difficult to prevent an attacker from spoofing bogus paging
   requests or paging router advertisement messages, we allow
   the attack to proceed, but we limit its effectiveness. Under
   normal condition, the operation of the protocol is closer to
   method 1; under conditions of DoS, the operation is closer to
   method 2.

   In general, a host can be paged with an unauthenticated layer
   2 or layer 3 paging message. Upon reception of a page, the
   HOST sets up an SA with the PA. If the wakeup message turns

                             Lahap               September 2001

   out to have been spoofed  then the HOST goes into DoS
   protection mode.

   In DoS protection mode, the HOST sets up an SA with the TA.
   Subsequent layer 3 paging requests, i.e. paging RAs from that
   access router will be ignored unless they are authenticated
   by the SA. Layer 2 paging cannot be used unless there is an
   available layer 2 security mechanism with equivalent strength
   to IPsec (and the key management protocol  (KMP) for layer 2
   has access to the same authentication infrastructure that is
   used to create IPsec SAs).

   When a HOST goes into the active mode and establishes layer 3
   communication, it doesn't immediately send a dormant mode
   deregistration to the DMA. First, it attempts to establish an
   SA with the paging agent in the new paging area. If that
   fails, the HOST assumes that the paging agent was spoofed and
   it enters DoS protection mode.

   In DoS protection mode, the HOST does not immediately respond
   to paging messages. Before committing to the new area, HOST
   allows sufficient time for the PA in the existing paging area
   to send a competing paging messages. If HOST continues to
   receive conflicting paging messages, then it MUST
   periodically wake up and ping the paging agent with which it
   currently has an SA. If the existing access router is
   unreachable, then HOST should attempt to establish an SA with
   any of the other paging agents for which it has received an
   advertisement. If that fails, then MN should give up and
   simply enter inactive mode.

   Some notes on the use of IPsec: When IPsec is being used to
   protect triggered wakeup messages, the anti-replay feature of
   ESP/AH MUST be enabled. Also, IPsec SAs can be created by a
   variety of KMPs, and these have different properties. An IP
   paging protocol does not have a need for advanced security
   features such as perfect forward secrecy. With some key
   management protocols, such as KINK, once the initial SA has
   been setup, subsequent SA negotiations with other hosts in
   the domain can be very fast.
