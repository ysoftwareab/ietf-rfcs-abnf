Abstract 
 
   This document specifies a new Diameter Application to support the 
   Mobile IPv6's bootstrapping mechanism during the AAA authentication 
   and authorization phase based on PANA. PANA is used as a protocol for 
   network authentication between mobile nodes and access networks. 
   During the PANA authentication phase, the mobile node's initial 
   configuration information like its home address, home agent address 
   and IKE pre-shared keying material is piggybacked to the PANA 
   messages cryptographically protected by the PANA SA. The Diameter and 
   PANA message formats to support the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping are 
   defined.

Internet Draft   Diameter MIPv6 Bootstrapping Application   October 2004 
                                    
1. Introduction 
 
   Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping is defined as obtaining information at the 
   mobile node, so that the mobile node can successfully register with 
   an appropriate home agent [3]. Bootstrapping information includes the 
   mobile node's home address, home agent address and cryptographic 
   material to protect the Mobile IPv6 signaling. This information must 
   be secured using integrity and replay protection [3]. 
    
   PANA [4] is being standardized in the IETF PANA WG to provide network 
   authentication between clients and access networks. The PANA messages 
   which are exchanged after the EAP authentication is succeeded are 
   cryptographically protected by the PANA SA. This PANA SA provides the 
   integrity protection based on keyed message digest, replay protection 
   based on sequence numbers and data-origin authentication [4]. 
    
   This document specifies a new Diameter Application to support the 
   Mobile IPv6's bootstrapping mechanism during the AAA authentication 
   and authorization phase based on PANA. PANA is used as a protocol for 
   network authentication between mobile nodes and access networks. 
   During the PANA authentication phase, the mobile node's initial 
   configuration information like its home address, home agent address 
   and IKE pre-shared keying material is piggybacked to the PANA 
   messages cryptographically protected by the PANA SA. 
       
   The terminology introduced in this document is described first. The 
   overall architecture of the Diameter Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping 
   application is described next. And then, the protocol operations for 
   the home agent assignment in the home domain and visited domain are 
   described. Finally, the PANA and Diameter message formats to support 
   the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping are described.

   AAA Client: 
        AAA Client performs the diameter client function to request the   
        authentication and authorization of the mobile node to the  
        backend Diameter server. We assume the case that EP(Enforcement  
        Point), AR(Access Router) and the PAA(PANA Authentication Agent)   
        are co-located. The definition of EP and PAA is specified in [4].  
        In this document, the AAA Client represents the EP, AR and PAA.  
    
   PANA SA (PANA Security Association): 
        The definition of this is the same as specified in [4]. 
    
   MIPv6 MSA: 
        The IPsec SA to protect the MIPv6 signaling messages between the  
        MN and HA. 
 
   AAA-Key: 
        A key derived by the EAP peer and EAP server and transported to  
        the authenticator [4]. 
    
   PANA-AAA-Key: 
        An AAA-Key derived by the MN and the AAA server and transported  
        to the AAA Client.  
    
   MIPv6-AAA-Key: 
        An AAA-Key derived by the MN and the AAA server and transported  
        to the HA. This key is used to derive the IKE pre-shared key to  
        distribute the MIPv6 MSA.  
    
   PANA-AAA-Key-Id: 
        Identifier of PANA-AAA-Key. 
    
   MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id: 
        Identifier of MIPv6-AAA-Key.

   * PANA is used as the network authentication protocol and used to   
     securely deliver the bootstrapping information like, the MN's HoA,  
     HA address and the IKE pre-shared keying material between the MN  
     and the AAA Client. 
    
   * Diameter Bootstrapping Application protocol is used,   
        Between the AAA Client and the AAAv  
        Between the AAAv and the AAAh  
        Between the AAA Server and the HA  
    
   * The integrated ASP network scenario [3] is considered where the ASP  
     and the MSP are the same.  
    
3.1 Basic Assumptions 
    
   The communication channel between the AAA Client and the AAAv is 
   secure using TLS or IPsec as specified in [2]. 
    
   The communication channel between the AAAv and the AAAh is secure 
   using TLS or IPsec as specified in [2]. 
    
   The communication channel between the AAA Server and the HA SHOULD be 
   secure using TLS or IPsec. 
    
   EAP methods used for the MN's authentication SHOULD be capable of 
   deriving dynamic session keys.

   |                                                                  | 
   |<-----------------------IKE for MIPv6 MSA------------------------>|

   +------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
    
   The protocol consists of two phases. 
    
   1. Network discovery and initial handshake phase 
       
   2. Authentication and authorization phase for network access and  
      mobility service 
    
   In the first phase, an IP address of AAA Client is discovered and a  
   PANA session is established between the MN and the AAA Client. 
    
   The second phase includes the PANA authentication and the AAA's 
   authentication and authorization phases. When the EAP authentication 
   is succeeded, the PANA SA is setup to cryptographically protect the 
   channel between the MN and the AAA Client. Using this secure channel, 
   the Mobile IPv6's initial configuration information like the HoA, the 
   HA address and security keying material to generate the MIPv6 MSA is 
   transferred from the AAA server to the MN.  
    
   In this protocol, the AAA server assigns two session keys, PANA-AAA-
   Key and MIPv6-AAA-Key which are derived by the EAP authentication 
   result. The PANA-AAA-Key is transferred to the AAA Client and the 
   MIPv6-AAA-Key is transferred to the HA. Also, the key identifiers for 
   these keys are transferred to the MN. The PANA-AAA-Key is used to 
   derive the PANA SA which protects the PANA messages between the MN

   and the AAA Client. The MIPv6-AAA-Key is used to derive the IKE pre-
   shared key for distributing the MIPv6 SA between the MN and the HA. 
    
4. Protocol Operations

                  allocation of HA in the visited network. 
    
        8    Visited-Home-Agent-Available flag:  
                  This flag is set to '1' when the AAAv notifies to the  
                  AAAh that it can support the assignment of a HA in  
                  the visited network.

4.4 MN Operation 
    
   When a MN bootstraps, it first performs a PANA Discovery and initial 
   handshake phase between the MN and the AAA Client. Detailed 
   description about this phase is described in [4]. 
    
   After the MN receives a PANA-Auth-Request message from the AAA Client, 
   it sends a PANA-Auth-Answer message to request EAP authentication and 
   bootstrapping configuration to the AAA Client. The PANA-Auth-Answer 
   message contains the following AVPs. 
        
        User-Name AVP 
        MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP 
             Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag set to '1' 
        EAP-Payload AVP 
    
   Upon receipt of a PANA-Bind-Request message from the AAA Client, the 
   MN SHOULD check the integrity of the PANA-Bind-Request message using 
   the message authentication code derived by the PANA-AAA-Key. The 
   PANA-AAA-Key is can be identified by the received PANA-AAA-Key-Id AVP 
   value. The calculation process of the message authentication code is 
   specified in [4]. Replay protection SHOULD be guaranteed by checking 
   the sequence numbers. 
    
   And then, the MN checks the EAP-Payload value to confirm that its EAP 
   authentication request is accepted.  
    
   If the authenticated request is accepted, the MN checks the flag 
   value of the MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP contained in the PANA-Bind-
   Request message. If the Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag is set 
   to '1', the MN sets its HA's address using the value of the MIPv6-
   Home-Agent-Address AVP and sets its HoA using the value of the MIPv6-
   Mobile-Node-Address AVP and choose the MIPv6-AAA-Key based on the 
   value of the MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id AVP. 
    
   After that, the MN sends a PANA-Bind-Answer message by attaching the 
   MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id AVP to the AAA Client. This PANA-Bind-Answer message 
   SHOULD contain message authentication code. 
    
   And then, the MN performs the IKE exchange to distribute the MIPv6 
   MSA using the IKE pre-shared key which is computed using the MIPv6-
   AAA-Key. The method to compute the IKE pre-shared key for the MIPv6 
   MSA is described in the section 4.9. 
    
4.5 AAA Client Operation 
      
   Upon receipt of the PANA-Auth-Answer message, the AAA Client checks 
   the validity of this message. If the message is a valid PANA message, 
   the AAA Client constructs a new diameter message, AMR using the 
   information contained in the PANA-Auth-Answer message.

Internet Draft   Diameter MIPv6 Bootstrapping Application   October 2004 
                                    
    
   The relationship between the PANA session and AAA session SHOULD be 
   managed in the AAA Client.  
    
   The main AVPs contained in the AMR message are as follows. 
         
        User-Name AVP 
        MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector 
             Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag set to '1' 
        EAP-Payload 
    
   Upon receipt of an AMA message, the AAA Client checks whether the EAP 
   authentication for the MN is succeeded. If the MN is authenticated, 
   the AAA Client updates its MN-specific attributes (MN's link-local-
   address, PANA-AAA-Key). The AAA Client SHOULD keep the value of 
   MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id AVP to confirm that the same value is contained in 
   the upcoming PANA-Bind-Answer message.  
    
   The AAA Client SHOULD generate the message authentication code using 
   the PANA-AAA-Key. The calculation process of the message 
   authentication code is specified in [4]. The calculated value is set 
   to the MAC AVP. And then AAA Client produces the PANA-Bind-Request 
   message using the information contained in the AMA message. After 
   that, the AAA Client sends the PANA-Bind-Request message by attaching 
   the MAC AVP. This PANA-Bind-Request message contains the following 
   AVPs. 
    
        MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP 
             Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag set to '1' 
        MIPv6-Home-Agent-Address AVP 
        MIPv6-Mobile-Node-Address AVP 
        MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id AVP 
        PANA-AAA-Key-Id AVP 
        EAP-Payload AVP 
        MAC AVP 
    
   When the AAA Client receives the PANA-Bind-Answer message from the MN, 
   it SHOULD perform the integrity checking the PANA-Bind-Answer message 
   using the message authentication code derived by the PANA-AAA-Key. 
   The PANA-AAA-Key can be identified the received PANA-AAA-Key-Id AVP 
   value. Replay protection SHOULD be guaranteed by checking the 
   sequence numbers. After that, the AAA Client checks the value of 
   MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id AVP with the value kept from the AMA message. These 
   Key-Ids SHOULD be the same value. 
    
4.6 AAAv Operation 
    
   Upon receipt of the AMR message from the AAA Client, the AAAv first 
   verifies that the AMR message is sent from a valid AAA Client. If the

   sender is valid, the AAAv checks the flag value contained in the 
   MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP.  
    
   If the Home-Address-Allocatable-Only-in-Home-Domain flag is set to 
   '1', the AAAv just delivers the AMR message to the AAAh. 
    
   If the Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag is set to '1' and Home-
   Address-Allocatable-Only-in-Home-Domain is set to '0', and the 
   Visited-Home-Agent-Available flag is set to '1', the AAAv also just 
   delivers the message to the AAAh. This case means that mult-round EAP 
   authentication process is being performed. 
    
   If the Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag is set to '1' and Home-
   Address-Allocatable-Only-in-Home-Domain flag is set to '0', and the 
   Visited-Home-Agent-Available flag is set to '0', the AAAv checks 
   whether it can allocate a HA for the MN in the visited domain or not. 
   If AAAv can allocate a HA in the visited domain, it sets the Visited-
   Home-Agent-Available flag to '1'. After that, the AAAv sends the AMR       
   message to the AAAh.  
    
   When the AAAv receives an AMA message from the AAAh, the AAAv checks 
   the validity of the message. If the message is valid and the value of 
   EAP-Payload contained in this message indicates that the EAP 
   authentication is succeeded, the AAAv checks the flag value of the 
   MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP to decide whether the HA assignment should 
   be occurred in the visited domain.  
    
   If the Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag is set to '1' and the 
   Home-Agent-in-Visited-Domain flag is set to '1', the AAAv should 
   perform the HA assignment in the visited domain. The way to assign a 
   HA for the MN will be described in the next version of this draft. If 
   the AAAv assigns the HAv, it sets the HAv's address to MIPv6-Home-
   Agent-Address AVP and assigns a HoA for this MN. The assignment of 
   MN's HoA MAY be performed by the HAv. If the AAAv assigns the HoA, it 
   sets this address value to the MIPv6-Mobile-Node-Address AVP. And 
   then, AAAv sends the HMR message to the assigned HA containing the 
   MIPv6-AAA-Key AVP. After the AAAv receives the HMA message from the 
   HAv, it sends the AMA message to the AAA Client.  
    
   If the HA assignment process is not required, the AAAv simply 
   delivers the AMA message to the AAA Client. 
    
4.7 AAAh Operation 
    
   Upon receipt of the AMR message from the AAAv, the AAAh first 
   verifies that the AMR message is sent from a valid AAAv. If the 
   sender is valid, the AAAh investigates the EAP-Payload AVP whether 
   its value is empty signifying an EAP-Start. If the value of EAP-
   Payload AVP is empty, the AAAh starts the EAP authentication by 
   sending the AMA message containing an EAP-Payload AVP that includes

Internet Draft   Diameter MIPv6 Bootstrapping Application   October 2004 
                                    
   an encapsulated EAP packet and Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER-MULTI-
   ROUND-AUTH. 
    
   When the EAP authentication is succeeded, the AAAh investigates the 
   MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP.  
    
   If the Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag is set to '1' and the 
   Home-Address-Allocatable-Only-in-Home-Domain flag is set to '1', the 
   AAAh assigns a HAh for the MN. The way to assign a HAh for the MN 
   will be described in the next version of this draft. If the AAAh 
   assigns the HAh, it sets the HAh's address to the MIPv6-Home-Agent-
   Address AVP and assigns a HoA for this MN. The assignment of the MN's 
   HoA MAY be performed by the HAh. If the AAAh assigns the HoA, it sets 
   this address value to the MIPv6-Mobile-Node-Address AVP. After that, 
   the AAAh assigns the MIPv6-AAA-Key and its identifier, MIPv6-AAA-Key-
   Id. And then, the AAAh assigns the PANA-AAA-Key and its identifier 
   PANA-AAA-Key-Id. The value of MIPv6-AAA-Key and PANA-AAA-Key SHOULD 
   not be equal. And then, AAAh sends the HMR message to the assigned 
   HAh which contains the following AVPs. 
    
        User-Name AVP 
        MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP 
        MIPv6-AAA-Key AVP 
        MIPv6-Mobile-Node-Address AVP 
        MIPv6-Home-Agent-Address AVP 
    
   When the AAAh receives the HMA message from the HA, it sends the AMA 
   message to the AAAv which contains the following AVPs. 
    
        MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP 
        MIPv6-Home-Agent-Address AVP 
        MIPv6-Mobile-Node-Address AVP 
        MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id AVP 
        PANA-AAA-Key AVP 
        PANA-AAA-Key-Id AVP 
    
   If the Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag is set to '1' and the 
   Visited-Home-Agent-Available flag is set to '1', the AAAh sets the 
   Home-Agent-in-Visited-Domain flag to '1'. Even though the AAAh 
   doesn't assign the HA in the home domain, the AAAh SHOULD assign the 
   MIPv6-AAA-Key, the MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id, the PANA-AAA-Key and the PANA-
   AAA-Key-Id. After that, the AAAh sends the AMA message to the AAAv 
   which contains the following AVPs.  
    
        MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP 
        MIPv6-AAA-Key AVP 
        MIPv6-AAA-Key-Id AVP 
        PANA-AAA-Key AVP 
        PANA-AAA-Key-Id AVP

4.8 HA Operation 
       
   Upon receipt of the HMR message, the HA checks the validity of the 
   HMR message. If the HR receives the valid HMR message, it checks the 
   flag value contained in the MIPv6-Bootstrap-Vector AVP. If the 
   Mobile-Node-Bootstrap-Requested flag is set to '1' and MIPv6-Mobile-
   Node-Address AVP is not included in the HMR message, the HA assigns 
   the home address for the MN and includes this value to the MIPv6-
   Mobile-Node-Address AVP. After that, the HA sends the HMA message to 
   the AAA server which contains the following AVPs. 
    
        MIPv6-Home-Agent-Address AVP 
        MIPv6-Mobile-Node-Address AVP 
    
   After sending the HMA message, the HA generates the IKE pre-shared 
   key to distribute MIPv6 MSA using value of MIPv6-AAA-Key AVP as 
   described in the section 4.9. 
    
4.9 IKE Pre-shared key derivation 
    
   The method to drive the IKE pre-shared key using the AAA-Key is 
   provided in the [5] and the same method is used to derive the pre-
   shared key for MIPv6 MSA.  
    
        The IKE pre-shared key for MIPv6 MSA = HMAC-SHA-1 (MIPv6-AAA-Key,  
                              "MIPv6-IKE-PSK" | MIPv6-Key-Id | HoA | HA) 
    
   The HoA and HA address are used to derive the IKE pre-shared key. It 
   means that only the authenticated, authorized and bootstrapped MN can 
   negotiate the IKE exchange with the assigned HA.

6. Security Considerations 
 
   The Mobile IPv6's bootstrapping configuration information must be 
   secured using integrity and replay protection [3]. In this document, 
   the MN's bootstrapping information, HoA, HA address and IKE pre-
   shared keying material is delivered by the PANA-Bind-Request between 
   the MN and AAA Client. The PANA messages which are exchanged after 
   the EAP authentication is succeeded are cryptographically protected 
   by the PANA SA. This PANA SA provides the integrity protection based 
   on keyed message digest, replay protection based on sequence numbers 
   and data-origin authentication [4]. Therefore, the integrity and

Internet Draft   Diameter MIPv6 Bootstrapping Application   October 2004 
                                    
   replay protection of the bootstrapping configuration information is 
   guaranteed. 
    
   The link between the AAA Server and the HA SHOULD be protected by the 
   IPsec or TLS to securely transfer the security keying materials. 
    
   We RECOMMEND the use of different AAA-Keys for the PANA SA and MIPv6 
   MSA to minimize the security risks. If the same AAA-Key is used, the 
   disclosure of one key could result in the security threat to the 
   entire system.
