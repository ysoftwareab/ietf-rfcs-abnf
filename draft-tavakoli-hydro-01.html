<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>HYDRO is a hybrid routing protocol for Lossy and Low power
        Networks (L2Ns) that embraces centralized and distributed routing 
	mechanisms.
        Through the use of standard ICMP Route Advertisements and Route
        Solicitations, Node Routers build Default Routes to Border Routers.
        These routes, which maintain multiple options per each Node Router when
        available, are maintained through data-driven link estimation.
        Node Routers periodically report a high-quality subset of their Default
        Route Table to Border Routers, which then form a global view of the
        topology.  When a Node Router attempts to route to another Node
        Router in the
        network, if no matching entry exists in the Node Router's Flow Table,
        it forwards the packet to a Border Router, which then
        installs the correct Flow Table Entries in the network to enable
        more efficient subsequent routing.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The Hybrid Routing Protocol (HYDRO) for Lossy and Low Power
	      Networks utilizes the two-tiered hierarchy that is used
	      in many deployments.  It provides point-to-point routing using a
	      combination of centralized and distributed mechanisms.
</p>
<p>L2N networks are often deployed in two tiers: Node 
	      Routers (or Nodes from now on) in
	      the network which gather data but are resource constrained, 
	      and Border Routers, which
	      provide connectivity between the L2N subnet and another network.
              The Nodes have constrained
	      resources, in the form of limited energy, memory, and bandwidth.
	      Consequently, a routing protocol MUST ascribe to a set of 
	      minimal criteria, as laid out in 
	      <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey'>the IETF Roll
	        Protocols Survey<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tavakoli, A., Dawson-Haggerty, S., and P. Levis, &ldquo;Overview of Existing Routing Protocols for Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;protocols&#8209;survey].  These requirements were culled

		with the requirements intended to provide a necessary, but 
		not necessarily sufficient baseline.  They apply to low-power
	      Node Routers, but not to the Border routers.
</p>
<p>The Border Routers, however, are assumed to have a relatively abundant supply
	      of resources, leading to HYDRO's goal of maintaining as much state
	      and complexity at the Border Routers as possible, and only pushing
	      necessary functionality to the Nodes.

Overview</h3>

<p>HYDRO provides point-to-point connectivity between all Nodes in
        a network, but is optimized for situations in which the number of
        network destinations in the network is far smaller than the number of
        Nodes.  Additionally, much of the traffic is typically between Node
        routers in the network and hosts on other networks.  Thus, our design
        optimizes first for this traffic pattern.  It also not uncommon for
        there to be some unicast traffic between different Node Routers; for
        instance, for control or debugging, and so we provide a second
        mechanism for optimizing this traffic.
</p>
<p>An underlying set of routing trees are created using IPv6 Route
        Advertisement and Route Solicitation Messages.  Each Border Router
        advertises a route with '0' cost.  Nodes process Router
        Advertisements from both Border Routers and Nodes, and add their 
	Link Cost
        Estimate to the advertised Route Cost Estimate, and then themselves
        advertise this new cumulative Overall Route Cost.
</p>
<p> HYDRO allows for multiple Border Routers to manage a network.  We
	detail the mechanisms for setting up and managing such a topology in
	later sections, but for ease of understanding frame our discussion in
	the context of networks with only a single Border Router.  Such a
	simplification does not alter the functionality of Nodes.
</p>
<p>Each Node maintains information about multiple potential next-hops to
        the Border Router, which form a set of Default Routes.  The ordering of
        these choices, is based on a combination of the Overall Route
        Cost, the Confidence in the Link Cost Estimate (which is
        a component of that Overall Route Cost), and a Node's Willingness To
	Route (Willingness).  Confidence MAY be measured
        by the number of packets over which the Link Cost Estimate is formed, 
	both of which are provided by the link layer.
</p>
<p>Each Node periodically reports a high-quality subset of its 
      Default Route Table, as well
        as any requested Node Attributes, whether static or dynamic, in the form
        of Topology Reports to a Border Router.  Using this information, the
        Border Routers create a global view of the topology of the subnet.
</p>
<p>When a Node needs to route a packet, either as its originator or a
  	    forwarder, it attempts to classify a packet against its Flow Table (which
  	    is initially empty).  If an entry matches the packet, then the packet is
  	    forwarded according to the rules specified by the entry.  Otherwise, the
  	    Node forwards the packet along a Default Route to the Border Router.
</p>
<p>When a data packet destined for a Node Router, with a destination address within the subnet reaches
  	    a Border Router, the Border Router determines the best route, according
  	    to its global topology view and a user-specified routing policy
  	    (e.g. lowest cost).  It then forwards the packet to the destination by
  	    inserting a source routing header into the packet and forwarding it to the
  	    first hop in the source route.  It SHOULD additionally generate a Route Install Header for either
  	    the source or destination of the packet, instructing it to install the
  	    necessary Flow Table Entries to route future similar packets 
	    more efficiently.  This header
  	    may be set in a new packet or added to the original data packet.
</p>
<p>HYDRO mechanisms require the frequent transmission (or exchange) 
      of IPv6 addresses.
        Because full 128-bit addresses in this setting are not practical, we

HYDRO Terminology</h3>

<p>Border Router: A device with relatively abundant resources and 
      multiple interfaces, including an interface (the 'L2N Interface')
      that shares a link type
      with Nodes.
</p>
<p>L2N Network: A network with a single IPv6 prefix encompassing both a
      set of Border Routers and Node.  Multiple types of links connect
      these routers, and the Border Routers are all in a single link-local
      multicast domain.  All interfaces on this network share a single prefix
      (the L2N prefix).
</p>
<p>L2N Interface: The interface which the Border Router uses to
      communicate with devices on the subnet.
</p>
<p>Secondary Interface: A second interface the Border Router uses to
      communicate with other Border Routers.  Examples include an Ethernet or
      802.11 mesh.
</p>
<p>Default Route: A route leading to a Border Router from a Node,
        composed of a locally maintained next-hop link.
</p>
<p>Default Route Table: A Node's table which contains information
	about a set of Default Routes and their associated next-hop Nodes,
	including the cost of communicating with a Border Router using that
	particular Default Route.
</p>
<p>Flow Table: A table with a (Classification, Action) format, in which
        'Classification' helps categorize which packets an entry applies to, and
        'Action' describes how to forward a matching packet.
</p>
<p>Neighbor: A Node or Border Router within a single IP-hop.
</p>
<p>Node Attributes: Information about a Node, either static 
        (e.g. bandwidth, resources), or dynamic (e.g. energy left).
</p>
<p>Node Router (Node): Any node in the network that serves as a router,
        but not as a Border Router.  Typically a constrained device.
</p>
<p>Overall Route Cost: The cumulative cost of a particular Default
	Route option, obtained by summing the Route Cost Estimate advertised
	by the associated next-hop Node, and the Link Cost Estimate of 
	communicating with that Node.
</p>
<p>Primary Default Route: The Default Route that a Node attempts to
	use before all other potential Default Routes.  Typically the top
	entry in the Default Route Table, but we detail mechanisms that allow
	other entries in the Default Route Table to also periodically serve
	as the Primary Default Route.
</p>
<p>Route Install Message: A message containing the bidirectional path
        between two Nodes.  The message also dictates installation
        type.
</p>
<p>Topology Report: Includes a subset of information about a subset
        of Default Route next-hops from the Default Route Table, as well as requested Node
        Attributes.
</p>
<p>Willingness To Route (Willingness): An advertised value that 
	indicates a Node's willingness to route packets for other Nodes.
	Setting the value of this metric is policy-driven and outside the
	scope of this document.

Default Route Table</h3>

<p>Each Node maintains a Default Route Table, whose entries
		      contain the following fields:
</p>
<p> Neighbor Address: 16-bit short IPv6 address of the 
		      neighboring Node or Border Router.
</p>
<p> Route Hops: The distance to a Border Router in hops using
		      the specified Neighbor as the next-hop.
</p>
<p> Route Cost Estimate: Route cost advertised by the
		    next-hop Node for this entry.
</p>
<p> Willingness: The Willingness to Route advertised by
		    the next-hop Node for this entry.
</p>
<p>There are also certain fields associated with a Default Route
	Entry that MUST be provided by the Link Layer, but are used by HYDRO
	for Default Route Table seeding and maintenance.  These fields
	are: 
</p>
<p> Link Cost Estimate: Estimate of the link cost to
			 communicate with the next-hop Node for this entry.  
			 The link layer MAY need multiple packet transmissions 
			 and acknowledgements to provide
			 this estimate.
</p>
<p> Link Quality: Last recorded link quality measurement.  The link layer MUST be able to provide this value based on a single
			 packet reception.  The metric
	and scale of this field is likely hardware-dependent.  
</p>
<p> Confidence: The Confidence of the link layer in 
			 the Link Cost Estimate it provides.
</p>
<p> The size of the Default Route Table is dictated by
		      NUM_DEFAULT_ENTRIES.

		      include a Packet Destination field, and MAY contain
		      certain additional fields, such as Packet Source.
</p>
<p> Flow Path: The Flow Path indicates the path a packet
		      should take.  This can either be a full source route, or
		      simply the next-hop to which the packet should be sent to.

Additional Adaptations</h3>

<p>The 6lowpan working group has defined an adaptation layer for
            IPv6 datagrams, when carried over Low Power and Lossy links.  This

            function of the adaptation layer involving extension headers,
            which is necessary to use these header efficiently.  The
            generalized IPv6 extension header format is defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2460'>[RFC2460]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S. and R.

            The "Hdr Ext Len" is specified in units of 8-octet chunks, 
	    not including
            the first 8 octets.  A similar layout is used for TLV-encoded
            options, except the 'Next Header' field is named the 'Option Type'
            field.  We suggest that the 6lowpan working group may wish to
            define, as part of the adaptation layer, lengths in units of
            single octets; we will
            assume for the rest of this document that such a modification is
            in effect.  Although this limits the length of extension headers
            and options to 255 bytes, we feel that this is not a significant
            limitation and the payload savings resulting from removing
            unnecessary padding are significant.

Link Estimation</h3>

<p>A critical design element for good performance in L2N networks is
          good link estimation; low power wireless links exhibit significant
          temporal and spatial variations in quality due to a number of physical
          and environmental phenomenon.  This poses a challenge to traditional
          IP link abstraction since any protocol must account for this
          behavior.
        
</p>
<p>The link layer MUST provide an additive link metric for potential
          links to the routing layer, such that the cost of a path C[A -> B ->
          C] = C[A -> B] + C[B -> C].  Examples of such a metric are 
	  Expected Transmissions (ETX) or Expected Transmission Time (ETT).
          Additionally, the link layer MUST provide an estimate of its
          Confidence in each Link Cost Estimate.  These estimates MAY be binary or integer
          valued.
        
</p>
<p>The link layer must also provide a mechanism for 'local broadcast';
          the 802.15.4 broadcast address (0xffff) is such a mechanism.  It MAY
          be advantageous to replace this mechanism with a dedicated discovery
          component in the future.

Router Discovery</h3>

<p>Router Advertisement and Router Solicitation messages and the associated
	protocol have been standardized for IPv6 in <a class='info' href='#RFC2461'>[RFC2461]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., and W. Simpson, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.  While many of the mechanisms can be
	applied directly in L2Ns, some require modification for efficiency or
	performance.  The 6lowpan working group has created a team to
	investigate these necessary modifications; once their work is complete
	HYDRO SHOULD be modified to used those mechanisms.
        
</p>
<p>We do not alter the Router Solicitation or Router Advertisement
          packet formats.  We do define a new Router Advertisement extension,
          the Multihop extension, which allows Nodes to advertise their Overall Route
          Cost value.  Router Advertisements without this extension are assumed
          to have a Total Route Cost of zero.  In addition, another extension
	  allows Router Advertisements to specify a Node's Willingness value.
        
</p>
<p>When an event triggers the generation of Router Solicitation or
          Router Advertisement messages, a binary exponential timer is started.
          Each time the timer fires, a new Router Solicitation or 
	  Advertisement is
          generated and sent to the IPv6 all-routers link-local multicast
          address (ff02::2), using the link broadcast facility.
        
</p>
<p>There are two conditions which cause a reset of the Router
          Solicitation timer, and thus the transmission of new Router
          Solicitations:
        
</p>
<p>1. Boot
</p>
<p>2. No valid Default Route is present in the Default Route Table.
</p>
<p>There are two conditions which cause the Router Advertisement
          timer to be started, if it is not running, and thus the transmission

</p>
<p>1. Reception of a Router Solicitation, and the Primary Default Route

Default Route Formation</h3>

<p>The Border Router is manually configured with an IPv6 address, 
		      including a full 64-bit network prefix on its L2N Interface; all
		      Border Routers on the same L2N Subnet have L2N Interfaces with
		      addresses on the same prefix.  A Node automatically
		      transmits Router Solicitations on boot, and nearby Nodes with a valid Primary Default Route 
		      will reply with Router Advertisements.  This section specifies
		      processing rules for these Router Advertisements.  The result is an ordered
		      table of potential next-hops towards the Border Router.
        
</p>
<p>A Node that receives a Router Advertisement from 
		    a Potential Default Route Neighbor (PNeighbor) 
		    first checks if a Default Route entry for PNeighbor
          exists in its Default Route Table.
          If an entry for PNeighbor does not exist, it begins processing the
          Route Advertisement to determine if an entry for PNeighbor 
	  should be inserted.
        
</p>
<p>The Default Route Table is sorted based on a combination of Overall
		      Route Cost, which is the sum value of the Route Cost 
		      Estimate
		      advertised by the next-hop Neighbor and the Link Cost Estimate, 
		      the Confidence, and the Willingness advertised by an 
		      entry's next-hop Node.  The Confidence and Link Cost
		      Estimate MUST be provided by the link layer.
        
</p>
<p>Processing begins by checking whether the link layer 
		    Link Quality Metric
          exceeds the necessary threshold (LINK_ADMIT_THRESH) to be considered.  The exact metric
          is implementation specific, and MAY NOT be the Link Cost
          Estimate ultimately used for Default Route maintenance.  For instance,
          implementations may use a link measurement like RSSI or LQI, along
          with a static or dynamic threshold to reject poor links.  The
          rationale is that estimators like ETX require multiple packets before
          they can be trusted, whereas the routing layer must evaluate a flood of
          Router Advertisements for possible use as Default Routes.  
        
</p>
<p>A Node next checks if an empty spot exists in the Default Route
		      table.  If a spot exits, then HYDRO determines where in the table to
		      insert an entry for PNeighbor.  The algorithm begins by creating a
		      new Default Route entry at the bottom of the Default Route table.  It
		      then repeatedly compares the new Default Route entry with the entry in
		      the spot above it.  If the higher spot is empty, or if the entry
		      also has a '0' Confidence value and its advertised Route Cost
		      Estimate is greater than the PNeighbor's advertised Route Cost
		      Estimate, the two entries' positions are swapped.  The iteration stops
		      when this condition fails, or the algorithm reaches the top of the
		      Default Route Table.
        
</p>
<p>If the Default Route Table is full, then HYDRO determines whether the
		      bottom Default Route Table entry should be evicted to create room for
		      PNeighbor.  If the bottom entry is not Mature, meaning that its
		      Confidence value is less than CONF_EVICT_THRESHOLD, or its
		      Route Hops value is less than PNeighbor's Route Hops value, we
		      leave the Default Route Table as is and discard the Route
		      Advertisement.  
        
</p>
<p>Otherwise, if PNeighbor's Route Cost Estimate is lower than
		      the existing Default Route Entry's Route Cost Estimate by at least
		      PATH_COST_DIFF_THRESH, or if the absolute value of the difference
		      between the two Route Cost Estimates is less than
		      PATH_COST_DIFF_THRESH and PNeighbor's Link Quality Estimate is
		      greater than the existing Default Route Entry's Link Quality Estimate by at least
		      LINK_QUALITY_DIFF_THRESH, than the existing bottom 
		      Default Route Table
		      Entry is evicted to make room for PNeighbor's entry.
        
</p>
<p>If an entry slot is found for PNeighbor, the field values
		      are set according to the Router Advertisement.  If an entry previously
		      existed for PNeighbor, then the field values are simply updated.
        
</p>
<p>If the Route Cost in the Route Advertisement is set to
		      MAX_ROUTE_COST and PNeighbor was already present in the Default
		      Route Table, the existing PNeighbor entry is evicted.
        
</p>
<p>The top entry in the Default Route Table is the Primary Default
    		  Route. We define the Overall Node Route Cost at any given time to be
    		  the Overall Route Cost of the Primary Default Route, and Overall Route
    		  Hops to be the Route Hops Value of the Primary Default Route.  If no
    		  Primary Default Route exists, these are set to MAX_ROUTE_COST and
    		  MAX_HOPS, respectively.
        
</p>
<p>At the end of each period, as determined by PERIOD_LENGTH, each
		      Node reevaluates its Default Route Table.  If the 
		      Default Route Table is empty
		      (implying that no Primary Default Route exits), a Router Solicitation
		      is sent out, requesting Router Advertisements from neighboring Nodes.
		      In addition, if the absolute difference between the Node's Overall
		      Node Route Cost at the end of the last period, and the current Overall
		      Node Route Cost is greater than ROUTE_COST_NOTIF_DIFF, or the Overall
		      Route Hops has changed since the end of the last period, 
		      the Node sends a
		      Routing Advertisement.
        
</p>
<p>After each Router Solicitation, if after SOLICITATION_PERIOD time,
		      no Primary Default Route exists, another Router Solicitation is sent
		      out.  This SHOULD be modified to use a Trickle or Exponential Backoff
		      Timer.

Global Topology Construction</h3>

<p>Each Border Router maintains a view of the topology of the entire
		      L2N Subnet using
		      information obtained from the Topology Reports created by each
		      Node.
        
</p>
<p>Each Node prepares a Topology Report periodically, with period
		      length determined by TOP_REPORT_PERIOD.  The Node then holds off on
		      sending the report for TOP_REPORT_WAIT time, in an attempt to
		      piggyback the report on a data packet.  This Topology 
		      Report is added
		      to an IP datagram as an IPv6 hop-by-hop options header using a new
		      TLV dispatch value.
        
</p>
<p>For each entry within the top DEFAULT_TOP_THRESH slots (inclusive),
		      if the slot is not empty, the entry is flagged as Mature (Confidence
		      >= CONF_EVICT_THRESH), or it is set as the Primary Default Route, then
		      its Address, Link Cost Estimate, and Confidence are inserted
		      into the Topology Report.
        
</p>
<p>In addition to Default Route information, the Node 
		    SHOULD include
		      requested Node Attribute values, which are defined outside of HYDRO by
		      the application, and SHOULD include its Willingness value
        
</p>
<p>The Topology Report is then sent to the Border Router.  The report
          MAY be added to an outgoing data packet destined to the Border Router,
          or in a new message generated by the Node.  Topology reports SHOULD
          NOT be inserted into messages where a Flow Match is available in the
          Flow Entry Table.
        
</p>
<p>The Border Router maintains a graph of the entire network.  When it
    		  receives a Topology Report from a Node, it first compares
    		  the Sequence Number contained in the Topology Report against
    		  the last received sequence number (LSN) from that Node.  If the
    		  Sequence Number is greater than the LSN, or
    		  if it is less then LSN - SEQ_ROLLOVER_THRESH, or if this is
    		  the first report from this Node Router, the Border Router
                  removes the edges created
    		  by previous Topology Report from the same Node, and inserts edges
    		  based on the information in the latest Topology Report.  Edge costs
    		  are determined by policy.  One option is to use the Link Cost
    		  Estimates from the Topology Report.  In addition, the Node Attributes
    		  can be associated with the appropriate graph vertices.

Node Forwarding</h3>

<p> For any given packet at a Node, whether it originated there or is
		      simply being forwarded, a series of steps are taken in order to
		      determine how to send the packet.  HYDRO SHOULD specify 
		      multiple next-hops for any particular packet when available.  
		      If transmission to the first next-hop
		      fails, HYDRO will attempt to use the next next-hop,
		      until all choices provided have failed.  The
		      link layer MUST use link-layer acknowledgements in order to determine
		      transmission success or failure, and SHOULD retry failed
		      transmissions.  This section describes how the ordered 
		      list of potential next-hops is constructed for a 
		      particular packet.
        
</p>
<p> 1. If the packet contains an IPv6 Routing Header, the address of
		      the next-hop is determined using that route, and the 'Segments
		      remaining' field of the routing header is decremented.  The address
		      from the routing header is provided as the first choice next-hop.
		      If a router receives a packet containing a routing header where the
		      segments remaining field is zero but the router is not the
		      destination, the router SHOULD ignore the routing header.
        
</p>
<p> 2. If no routing header exists, HYDRO examines the Flow Table to
          determine if a matching entry exists.  The matching process depends
          on the particular instantiation of the Flow Match data structure.
        
</p>
<p> 2.1. If the matching entry indicates the Flow Path Type is
		      FULL_PATH, then this indicates the Flow Path is a full Source
		      Route.  If the packet was locally generated, a new routing header
		      is inserted into the packet and the next hop of that path
		      provided as the first choice next-hop.
        
</p>
<p> 2.2. If the matching entry indicates the Flow Path Type is
		      NEXT_HOP_PATH, then this indicates the Flow Path is a next hop
		      address, with each Node along the path expected to have a
		      similar entry.  This Node address is provided as the first
		      next-hop choice.  The NEXT_HOP_PATH data structure MAY store
		      multiple potential next hops, in an ordered list, 
		      specified by NUM_HOP_CHOICES.  More then one
		      potential next hop MAY be provided using this list.
        
</p>
<p> 3. Finally, HYDRO uses the Default Route Table to choose a 
		    next-hop, and forwards the packet towards the Border Router.
		    HYDRO will
		      attempt to send to the Primary Default Route first, followed by
		      the top entries of the Default Routing Table.
        
</p>
<p>The number of next-hops that HYDRO attempts to use when forwarding
		      a particular packet is determined by NUM_NEXT_CHOICES.  In addition,
		      a packet that is being forwarded MUST NOT select its previous-hop
		      Node as the next-hop Node.  If an entry specifies such a case, it is
		      ignored and the process described above continues.
</p>
<p>HYDRO receives feedback from the link layer following each
		      transmission about which Default Route next-hops the link was able to successfully
		      use.  If the number of consecutive failures of the Primary Default
		      Route is greater than MAX_CONSEC_FAILURES, HYDRO initiates a search for
		      a new Primary Default Route.  If another Default Route Table entry exists
		      whose Route Hops is less than the Primary Default Route's Route Hops,
		      and its Route Cost Estimate is less than the Primary Default Route's
		      Route Cost Estimate, then one of these candidates is selected at
		      random (if multiple choices exist) to be the new Primary Default Route
		      (although the table is not reordered).  If no such candidate is
		      found, then the Route Hops comparison is dropped and the same search
		      is performed again with only Route Cost Estimate comparisons.  If
		      again no candidate is found, then the Primary Default Route remains
		      unchanged.
</p>
<p>In addition, at the end of each period, with probability NEW_PRIMARY_ROUTE_PROB, this same exploration for an alternate Primary
		      Default Route occurs, allowing HYDRO an opportunity to
		      increase the Confidence in other Default Route Entry
		      Link Cost Estimates.
</p>
<p>As a final task at the end of each period, if a Node
		      that is a single hop away from a Border Router determines
		      that it has failed to successfully transmit a single 
		      packet to a Border Router (while at least making one 
		      attempt), it determines that the link to the Border 
		      Router is gone, and SHOULD broadcast a Router 
		      Advertisement advertising an Overall Route Cost of 
		      MAX_ROUTE_COST, and Overall Route Hops of 
		      MAX_HOPS.  Not broadcasting such a message MAY lead
		      to longer convergence times in networks with multiple 
		      Border Routers that may fail or be mobile.
</p>
<p>After each forwarding attempt, HYDRO reorders the
		      Default Route Table using updated link statistics from the recent attempt.
		      If the packet was transmitted successfully (using 
		      Node 'A' as the next-hop) and the 
		      entry (A) is not the
		      top entry in the Default Route Table, it swaps positions with the entry
		      above it (B) if its Confidence is greater than CONF_PROM_THRESHOLD and one of the following three conditions hold:
</p>
<p>1. Overall Route Cost of A + WILLINGNESS_COST_THRESH < Overall Route Cost of B.
</p>
<p>2. Overall Route Cost of A is less than the 
		      Overall Route Cost of B, or greater than it by less than 
		      PATH_COST_DIFF_THRESH, and the 
		      absolute value of the difference between the Willingness
		      of A and the Willingness of B is less than or equal to
		      WILLINGNESS_THRESH.
</p>
<p>3. A's Overall Route Cost is within 
		      WILLINGNESS_COST_THRESH of B's Overall Route Cost, and
		      A's Willingness > B's Willingness + WILLINGNESS_THRESH.

Border Router Forwarding</h3>

<p>Border Routers will receive packets from Nodes in the L2N in the
          course of normal operation, since Nodes will forward
          packets to a Border Router when they do not have a matching Flow 
          Table Entry for a packet.  The Border Router should process 
	  packets which
          originated on its L2N interface as follows:
        
</p>
<p>NOTE: Some of the following steps assume multiple Border Routers
	exist in a network.  We describe the setup and maintenance of such a
	topology in a later section.
</p>
<p>1. If the destination address is a global unicast address, normal
          IPv6 processing rules apply; the packet will be routed according to
          the IPv6 Routing Table Entry for that destination.
        
</p>
<p>2. If the packet contains an IPv6 Routing Header and the first hop
          of that route is another Border Router, the packet is
          dropped.
        
</p>
<p>3. If the destination is a unicast address within the L2N
          subnet and the Border Router does not have a route in its route
          database, the packet is dropped.  It MAY generate an ICMPv6 Host
          Unreachable message in this case, but implementers SHOULD take care
          to limit the rate of message generation; it MAY be advantageous in
          many cases not to generate this message.
        
</p>
<p>4. Otherwise, the Border Router has a stored route to the
          destination (in the L2N subnet):
        
</p>
<p>4.1 If the Border Router has a route to the destination and the
          next-hop is another Border Router, the packet is forwarded to that
          Border Router without modification.
        
</p>
<p>4.2. If the Border Router has a route to the destination and
          the next-hop is a Node, the Border Router inserts an
          IPv6 Routing Header containing the source route to the
          destination, and transmits the packet to the first hop
          of this route.

Route Installation</h3>

<p>In the course of forwarding a packet as described in the 'Border
          Router Forwarding' section, a Border Router may determine that it is
          not on the best path between the source and destination Node 
	  (where 'best' is defined by a user-specified routing policy, such
	  as lowest cost).
          Alternatively, there may be administratively configured routes
          between Nodes in the network.  HYDRO SHOULD install routes to
	  enable more efficient routing, but in any case, the exact policy for
          determining when and what routes are installed is not part of the
          HYDRO protocol; what is required is that HYDRO Nodes process
          installation messages as described.
        
</p>
<p>Two types of routes may be installed: hop-by-hop and full path
          routes.  For a hop-by-hop route from Node A to Node B, each
          intermediate Node N_i on the path P=[A,N_1,N_2...N_i,B] from A to
          B adds a Flow Table Entry indicating that packets destined to B 
	  (and also potentially originating from A) have
          next hop N_i+1.  A full path install of this same route would place
          the entire path P into the Flow Table of Node A; outgoing packets
          from A destined to B use the path to
          insert an IPv6 Routing Header containing the route.  If the reverse 
	  option is selected, intermediate Nodes would have to create Flow 
	  Table entries for the reverse direction as well for hop-by-hop route 
	  installs, and the full reverse path would have to be installed at B for
	  full path route installs.
        
</p>
<p>Suppose a Border Router R wishes to install a route between
          Nodes A and B.  A Route Install Header is created
          and placed into the IPv6 Destination Options header.  The 'method'
          field is set to either HOP_BY_HOP or FULL_PATH, and the 'reverse'
          field is set to indicate whether or not the path from B to A should
          also be installed.  The Flow Match is initialized to indicate that
          the destination address of the Flow is B.  
          This header is placed either in a 
	  new packet
          addressed to Node A, or in the header of an existing
          packet which is destined to Node A.
        
</p>
<p>When Node A receives the Route Install Message, it processes it
          as part of its processing of the Destination Options extension
          headers.  Regardless of the method of install, the router searches
          its Flow Table using the Flow Match in the routing header.  If one
          is present, it replaces it with the new information (if the 'method'
	  is FULL_PATH).  If the 'method' is HOP_BY_HOP, since there can be
	  NUM_FLOW_CHOICES for each Flow Table entry, if the same next-hop
	  Node already exists, it is brought to the top of the list.  Otherwise,
	  the bottom next-hop in the list is evicted, and the new next-hop is
	  placed at the top of the list.
        
</p>
<p>If the Flow Table is full, HYDRO evicts an entry using a Least
          Recently Used policy.  The Node then adds the route contained in
          the routing header to the Flow Table: it copies into the Flow Path
          either the entire route, if the method is FULL_PATH, or the next
          hop, if the method is HOP_BY_HOP.
        
</p>
<p>If the method is HOP_BY_HOP, or if the method is FULL_PATH and the
          reverse bit is set, the router generates a new packet.  The new
          packet contains an IPv6 Routing Header with the route specified in
          the Route Install Header.  If the method was HOP_BY_HOP, the router
          adds an IPv6 hop-by-hop option extension containing a new routing
          header.  This new hop-by-hop routing header does not contain 
	  the route since
          that information is present in the IPv6 Routing Header, and so the
          path_len field is zero.
        
</p>
<p>If a Node receives a Route Install Header in a hop-by-hop option,
          the method MUST be HOP_BY_HOP.  If this is the case, it inserts a
          new Flow Table entry using the Flow Match contained in the Route 
	  Install
          Header, and consults the routing header to determine the next-hop
          address to install.  The next hop address is the one obtained by
          following normal processing rules for the source header when
          forwarding the packet.

Multicast Forwarding</h3>

<p>In this so-called "route-over" design, the link-local multicast
          address is mapped directly to link-local broadcast at the link layer.
          Thus any packet destined to a link-local multicast group should be
          send by the originator using the links local broadcast facility;
          these packets clearly MUST NOT be forwarded or retransmitted by any
          non-origin Node.
</p>
<p>Additionally, it is often desirable for Nodes to send packets to
          all Nodes in a subnet, regardless of whether or not they are within
          a link-local broadcast domain.  For this purpose, we use the IPv6
          site-local scope.  First, we define the well-known address ff05::XXXX
          to correspond to a subnet-wide flood.  Nodes receiving packets
	  destined to this
          address SHOULD forward these packets using the link-local broadcast
          address; this may be done using a mechanism like Trickle to reduce
          dependency on network density; more details about this forwarding is
          elided from this document.

<a name="rfc.section.7.9"></a><h3>7.9.&nbsp;
Multiple Border Routers</h3>

<p>It is often desirable for multiple Border Routers to be present
            on single L2N subnet to provide a diversity of routing options and
            failover connectivity.  If more than one Border Router is present,
            layer 2 connectivity between them will be assumed, for example
            using Ethernet, 802.11 mesh, or virtual tunneled IP links
            (something similar to <a class='info' href='#RFC2003'>[RFC2003]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Perkins, C., &ldquo;IP Encapsulation within IP,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>).  The
            interface the Border Routers use to connect directly to the other
            Border Routers is named the Secondary Interface.
            
</p>
<p>
            The multiple Border Routers assign themselves unique address on
            the L2N subnet prefix using their Secondary Interface via manual
            configuration.  On startup, the Border Routers join a link-local
            multicast group ff02::XXXX on their secondary interface and begin
            listening for messages on UDP port XXXX.
            
</p>
<p>When a Border Router receives a Topology Report from a Node
            Router, the Topology Report should be appended to a Topology
            Report Package header and transmitted to the link-local multicast
            group.  Border Routers receiving Topology Report Packages should
            process the contained Topology Reports identically to locally
            received reports.  
            
</p>
<p>When Border Routers receive a Topology Report Package, they
            must annotate the previous hop of the message in their Link Database to
            indicate if it is a Border Router; that way, they can determine
            when the next hop to a Node is another Border Router.
            Furthermore, the transmission of Topology Report messages to other
            Border Routers ensures that all Border Routers maintain a
            consistent view of the topology.

Extensions</h3>

<p>The protocol specified in this draft addresses many of the unique
    demands of this space and the routing requirements spelled out in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey'>the IETF Roll Protocols
    Survey<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tavakoli, A., Dawson-Haggerty, S., and P. Levis, &ldquo;Overview of Existing Routing Protocols for Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;protocols&#8209;survey].  However, there are certain limitations of the design that
    are left for future revisions of the draft.
    
</p>
<p>First, routing from a Border Router to a Node relies on
    source routing.  Also, the FULL_PATH route install method uses source
    routing.  For paths longer then 5-10 hops, the per-packet overhead of this
    mechanism becomes unacceptable, as does the state at each Node that must
    maintain these paths.   There are many methods of fixing or
    ameliorating this problem.  Using the current design, deploying additional
    Border Routers to decrease the network depth may be an option in some
    situations.  Alternatively, a later protocol specification could include a
    mechanisms for loose source routing between landmarks, which might be
    determined by Border Routers.  This would serve as a hybrid of the 
    source routing and hop-by-hop route install options.  The need to test 
    the efficiency and functionality of these adaptations, particularly 
    in the face of multiple link failures, preclude their full
    specification at this point in the draft.
    
</p>
<p>Another issue is that of network numbering.  The current draft requires
    that Border Routers with two interfaces to assign themselves different
    address on the same L2N prefix to both of these interfaces.  This also
    occurs in the (experimental) design for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Proxies
    <a class='info' href='#RFC4389'>[RFC4389]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Thaler, D., Talwar, M., and C. Patel, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery Proxies (ND Proxy),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, but seems to the authors to be somewhat
    inelegant.  It may be possible to devise a better solution.

Configuration Parameters and Other Administrative Options</h3>

<p>CONF_EVICT_THRESHOLD: Setting of this MAY be dependent on the
	      data rate (because that determines how long it takes to get a 
	      Mature entry).  Initial implementations use '5'.
</p>
<p>CONF_PROM_THRESHOLD: Threshold for being able to promote an
	      entry in the Default Route Table.  Dependent on link layer.
</p>
<p>DEFAULT_TOP_THRESH: The maximum number of Default Route
	      Entries (from the top) that MAY be included in a Topology 
	      Report.  Recommended value is 4.
</p>
<p>LINK_ADMIT_THRESH: This value depends on the availability of
	      hardware based link quality metrics, (such as LQI for CC2420-Based
	      Hardware Platforms), and the setting of the threshold may depend on the
	      actual deployment environment as well.
</p>
<p>LINK_QUALITY_DIFF_THRESH: Will vary based on link quality metric
	      used.  For CC2420 LQI, 10 is the recommended value.
</p>
<p>MAX_CONSEC_FAILURES: Maximum number of consecutive failures
	    after which a new Primary Default Route SHOULD be used.  
	    Recommended value is 20 (if link layer retransmissions are 
	    included).
</p>
<p>MAX_HOPS: Upper bound value to denote invalid entry.
</p>
<p>MAX_ROUTE_COST: Upper bound value to denote invalid entry.
</p>
<p>NEW_PRIMARY_ROUTE_PROB: Probability of looking for another
	    Primary Default Route at the end of a period.  Recommended value
	    is 25%.
</p>
<p>NUM_DEFAULT_ENTRIES: The size of the Default Route Table, 
	    recommended to be '8'.
</p>
<p>NUM_FLOW_CHOICES: The maximum number of next-hop choices for
	    a HOP_BY_HOP Flow Table Entry.  Recommended value is 1.
</p>
<p>NUM_NEXT_CHOICES: The maximum number of next-hop choices to be
	    used when attempting to send a packet.
</p>
<p>PATH_COST_DIFF_THRESH: Threshold for determining whether two 
	      Route Costs are similar.  Depends on Metric used for Route Costs, 
	      but if ETX (Expected Transmissions) are used, the recommended value
	      is 1.
</p>
<p>PERIOD_LENGTH: Application dependent, will affect control traffic
	      rate and convergence rate, potentially.
</p>
<p>ROUTE_COST_NOTIF_DIFF: Difference in the route cost that merits
	      a Route Advertisement.  Route Cost is metric dependent, but if ETX is
	      used, then a recommended value is 0.5.
</p>
<p>SOLICITATION_PERIOD: Tradeoff between control traffic generated
	      and route formation.
</p>
<p>TOP_REPORT_PERIOD: To meet the ROLL requirements, this should be
	      lower bounded by the inverse of the data rate.
</p>
<p>TOP_REPORT_WAIT: This should be set to the variance in data 
	      reporting periods.
</p>
<p>WILLINGNESS_COST_THRESH: The buffer in Overall Route Cost 
	      that SHOULD be traded for a more willing Node to route packets.  
	      This is dependent on a particular application's tolerance for
	      routing stretch to reduce load on certain Nodes.
</p>
<p>WILLINGNESS_THRESH: The difference in Willingness that is
	      necessary for promoting a Default Route Entry that gives up
	      less Overall Route Cost than WILLINGNESS_COST_THRESH but more
	      than PATH_COST_DIFF_THRESH.  Is dependent on the range
	      in Willingness.

Applicability Statement</h3>

<p>HYDRO is designed for use in L2Ns that are composed of a two-tiered
	      hierarchy in which a set of Nodes are supported by a much
	      smaller set of more capable Border Routers.  In other words, HYDRO
	      was designed for scenarios laid out by the ROLL working group, as
	      detailed in the <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey'>Protocols
	        Survey<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tavakoli, A., Dawson-Haggerty, S., and P. Levis, &ldquo;Overview of Existing Routing Protocols for Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;protocols&#8209;survey].  As such, we now provide a brief analysis of HYDRO's
	      performance relative to the five quantified metrics, demonstrating
	      that it passes all five criteria.
</p>
<p>Table Scalability: The size of the Default Route Table is limited
	      by a constant, NUM_DEFAULT_ENTRIES, and as such is O(1).  The Flow Table
	      scales with the number of destinations, and so the total amount of
	      routing state is O(D), which meets the criteria.
</p>
<p>Loss Response: In the case that a link fails, this is only detected
	      when trying to send a data packet over the link.  In such a case, the
	      data packet is then forwarded over another path, potentially leading
	      to the installation of a new route in the network.  The updated
	      quality of the link is reported with the next Topology Report.  This
	      limits the scope of the loss response only to the active path,
	      achieving a pass.
</p>
<p>Control Cost: The three forms of control cost are route formation,
	      Topology Reports, and Route Install Messages.  Route Advertisement
	      messages
	      initiated by the Border Router can be turned down to arbitrarily low
	      frequencies, and Route Solicitation messages by Nodes are
	      only of single-hop scope and triggered by failure of all Default
	      Routes.  Route Install Messages are a product of data traffic, and
	      so subsequently HYDRO meets the requirement of being bound by the 
	      data rate plus a small constant.
</p>
<p>Link Cost: Link qualities play an integral part of routing in
	      HYDRO.
</p>
<p>Node Cost: Each Node can report the desired Node Attributes
	      as part of its Topology Reports, as well as its Willingness, 
	      and the objective function for
	      calculating routes at the Border Router can incorporate these.
