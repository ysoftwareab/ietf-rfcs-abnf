        Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data Frames in CAPWAP
                 draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel-06

Abstract

   Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) defines a
   specification to encapsulate a station's data frames between the
   Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).
   Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either
   locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP data
   channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments encapsulating
   data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example to an Access
   Router (AR)) is desirable.  Further, it may also be desirable to use
   different tunnel encapsulations to carry the stations' data frames.
   This document provides a specification for this and refers to it as
   alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation
   allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint
   different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many
   known encapsulation types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.  The WTP may
   advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the
   discovery or join process and AC may select one of the supported
   alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.

1.  Introduction

   Service Providers are deploying very large Wi-Fi deployments (ranging
   from hundreds of thousands of Access Points, APs (referred to as WTPs
   in CAPWAP terminology) to millions of APs.  These networks are
   designed to carry traffic generated from mobile users.  The volume in
   mobile user traffic is already very large and expected to continue
   growing rapidly.  As a result, operators are looking for scalable
   solutions that can meet the increasing demand.  The scalability
   requirement can be met by splitting the control/management plane from
   the data plane.  This enables the data plane to scale independent of
   the control/management plane.  This specification provides a way to
   enable such separation.

   CAPWAP ([RFC5415], [RFC5416]) defines a tunnel mode that describes
   how the WTP handles the data plane (user traffic).  The following
   types are defined:

   o  Local Bridging: All data frames are locally bridged.
   o  802.3 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.3
      format.
   o  802.11 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.11
      format.

   Figure 1 describes a system with Local Bridging.  The AC is in a
   centralized location.  The data plane is locally bridged by the WTPs
   leading to a system with centralized control plane with distributed
   data plane.  This system has two benefits: 1) reduces the scale
   requirement on data traffic handling capability of the AC and 2)
   leads to more efficient/optimal routing of data traffic while
   maintaining centralized control/management.

            Figure 1: Centralized Control with Distributed Data

   The AC handles control of WTPs.  In addition, the AC also handles the
   IEEE 802.11 management traffic to/ from the stations.  There is
   CAPWAP Control and Data Channel between the WTP and the AC.  Note
   that even though there is no user traffic transported between the WTP
   and AC, there is still a CAPWAP Data Channel.  The CAPWAP Data
   channel carries the IEEE 802.11 management traffic (like IEEE 802.11
   Action Frames).

   Figure 2 shows a system where the tunnel mode is configured to tunnel
   data frames between the WTP and the AC either using 802.3 Tunnel or
   802.11 Tunnel configurations.  Operators deploy this configuration
   when they need to tunnel the user traffic.  The tunneling requirement
   may be driven by the need to apply policy at the Access Router or a
   legal requirement to support lawful intercept of user traffic.  This
   requirement could be met in the locally bridged system (Figure 1) if
   the access router implemented the required policy.  However, in many
   deployments the operator managing the WTP is different than the
   operator managing the Access Router.  When the operators are
   different, the policy has to be enforced in a tunnel termination
   point in the WTP operator's network.

            Figure 2: Centralized Control and Centralized Data

   The key difference with the locally bridged system is that the data
   frames are tunneled to the AC instead of being locally bridged.
   There are two shortcomings with system in Figure 2. 1) They do not
   allow the WTP to tunnel data frames to an endpoint different from the
   AC and 2) They do not allow the WTP to tunnel data frames using any
   encapsulation other than CAPWAP (as specified in Section 4.4.2 of
   [RFC5415]).

   Figure 3 shows a system where the WTP tunnels data frames to an
   alternate entity different from the AC.  The WTP also uses an
   alternate tunnel encapsulation such as such as L2TP, L2TPv3, IP-in-
   IP, IP/GRE, etc.  This enables 1) independent scaling of data plane
   and 2) leveraging of commonly used tunnel encapsulations such as
   L2TP, GRE, etc

       Figure 3: Centralized Control with Alternate Tunnel for Data

   The WTP may support widely used encapsulation types such as L2TP,
   L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, IP/GRE, etc.  The WTP advertises the different
   alternate tunnel encapsulation types it can support.  The AC
   configures one of the advertised types.  As shown in the figure there
   is a CAPWAP control and data channel between the WTP and AC.  The
   CAPWAP data channel carries the stations' management traffic as in
   the case of the locally bridged system.  The main reason to maintain
   a CAPWAP data channel is to maintain similarity with the locally
   bridged system.  The WTP maintains three tunnels: CAPWAP Control,
   CAPWAP Data, and another alternate tunnel for the data frame.  The
   data frames are transported by an alternate tunnel between the WTP
   and a tunnel termination point such as an Access Router.  This
   specification describes how the alternate tunnel can be established.
   The specification defines message elements for the WTP to advertise
   support for alternate tunnel encapsulation, the AC to configure
   alternate tunnel encapsulation, and for the WTP to report failure of
   the alternate tunnel.

   The alternate tunnel encapsulation also supports the third-party WLAN
   service provider scenario (i.e.  Virtual Network Operator, VNO).
   Under this scenario, the WLAN provider owns the WTP and AC resources,
   while the VNOs can rent the WTP resources from the WLAN provider for
   network access.  The AC belonging to the WLAN service provider
   manages the WTPs in the centralized mode.

   As shown in Figure 4, VNO 1&2 don't possess the network access
   resources, however they provide services by acquiring resources from
   the WLAN provider.  Since a WTP is capable of supporting up to 16
   Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs), the WLAN provider may provide
   network access service for different providers with different SSIDs.

   For example, SSID1 is advertised by the WTP for VNO1; while SSID2 is
   advertised by the WTP for VNO2.  Therefore the data traffic from the
   user can be directly steered to the corresponding access router of
   the VNO who owns that user.

   The above example describes how the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   may be established.  When the WTP joins the AC, it should indicate
   its alternate tunnel encapsulation capability.  The AC determines
   whether an alternate tunnel configuration is required.  If an
   appropriate alternate tunnel type is selected, then the AC provides
   the alternate tunnel encapsulation message element containing the
   tunnel type and a tunnel-specific information element.  (The tunnel-
   specific information element, for example, may contain information
   like the IP address of the tunnel termination point.)  The WTP sets
   up the alternate tunnel using the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   message element.

   On detecting a tunnel failure, WTP shall forward data frames to the
   AC and discard the frames.  In addition, WTP may dissociate existing
   clients and refuse association requests from new clients.  Depending
   on the implementation and deployment scenario, the AC may choose to
   reconfigure the WLAN (on the WTP) to a local bridging mode or to
   tunnel frames to the AC.  When the WTP detects an alternate tunnel
   failure, the WTP informs the AC using a message element, WTP
   Alternate Tunnel Fail Indication (defined in this specification).

   The WTP also needs to notify the AC of which AR(s) are unavailable.
   Particularly, in the VNO scenario, the AC of the WLAN service
   provider needs to maintain the association of the AR addresses of the
   VNOs and SSIDs, and provide this information to the WTP for the
   purpose of load balancing or master-slave mode.

   The message element has a status field that indicates whether the
   message denotes reporting a failure or the clearing of the previously
   reported failure.

   For the case where AC is unreachable but the tunnel end point is
   still reachable, the WTP behavior is up to the implementation.  For
   example, the WTP could either choose to tear down the alternate
   tunnel or let the existing user's traffic continue to be tunneled.

3.1.  Supported Alternate Tunnel Encapsulations

   This message element is sent by a WTP to communicate its capability
   to support alternate tunnel encapsulations.  The message element

3.4.  CAPWAP based Alternate Tunnel

   If the CAPWAP encapsulation is selected by the AC and configured by
   the AC to the WTP, the Info Element field defined in Section 3.2
   should contain the following information:

   o  Access Router Information: IPv4 address or IPv6 address or Fully
      Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), of the Access Router for the
      alternate tunnel.
   o  Tunnel DTLS Policy: The CAPWAP protocol allows optional protection
      of data packets using DTLS.  Use of data packet protection on a
      WTP is not mandatory but determined by the associated AC policy
      (This is consistent with the WTP behavior described in [RFC5415]).
   o  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy: It is used to specify how the
      CAPWAP data channel packet are to be tagged for QoS purposes (see
      [RFC5416] for more details).
   o  CAPWAP Transport Protocol: The CAPWAP protocol supports both UDP
      and UDP-Lite (see RFC3828).  When run over IPv4, UDP is used for
      the CAPWAP data channels.  When run over IPv6, the CAPWAP data
      channel may use either UDP or UDP-lite.

   The message element structure for CAPWAP encapsulation is shown in
   Figure 9:

3.5.  PMIPv6 based Alternate Tunnel

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) (defined in [RFC5213]) can also be used
   for alternate tunnel encapsulation between the WTP and the AR.  In
   this scenario, a WTP acts as the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) function
   that manages the mobility-related signaling for a station that is
   attached to the WTP IEEE 802.11 radio access.  The Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) function is at the AR.  If PMIPv6 encapsulation is

   selected by the AC and configured by the AC to a WTP, the Info
   Element field defined in Section 3.2 should contain the following
   information:

   o  Access Router (acts as LMA) Information: IPv6 address or Fully
      Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the alternate tunnel endpoint.

3.6.  Alternate Tunnel Information Elements

   This section defines the various elements described in Section 3.4
   and Section 3.5

3.6.1.  Access Router Information Elements

   The Access Router Information Elements allow the AC to notify a WTP
   of which AR(s) are available for establishing a data tunnel.  The AR
   information may be IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or AR domain name.  If
   a WTP obtains the correct AR FQDN, the Name-to-IP address mapping is
   handled in the WTP (see RFC2782).

   The following are the Access Router Information Elements defined in
   this specification.  The AC can use one of them to notify the
   destination information of the data tunnel to the WTP.  The Elements
   containing the AR IPv4 address MUST NOT be used if an IPv6 data
   channel such as PMIPv6 or GREv6 is used.

3.6.1.1.  AR IPv4 List Element

   This Element (see Figure 11) is used by the AC to configure a WTP
   with the AR IPv4 address available for the WTP to establish the data
   tunnel for user traffic.

3.6.2.  IEEE 802.11 WLAN Configuration Response

   Since AC can configure a WTP with more than one AR available for the
   WTP to establish the data tunnel(s) for user traffic, it may be
   useful for the WTP to communicate the selected AR.  To enable this,
   the IEEE 802.11 WLAN Configuration Response may contain the AR list
   element containing the selected AR.

3.6.3.  Tunnel DTLS Policy Element

   The AC distributes its DTLS usage policy for the CAPWAP data tunnel
   between a WTP and the AR.  There are multiple supported options,
   represented by the bit field below as defined in AC Descriptor
   message elements.  The WTP MUST abide by one of the options for
   tunneling user traffic with AR.  The Tunnel DTLS Policy Element obey
   the definition in [RFC5415].  If there are more than one ARs
   information provided by the AC for reliability reasons, the same
   Tunnel DTLS Policy (see Figure 14) is generally applied for all
   tunnels associated with the ARs.  Otherwise, Tunnel DTLS Policy MUST

   reserved in the version of the protocol supported by that
   implementation.  Receivers MUST ignore all bits not defined for the
   version of the protocol they support.

   A: If A bit is set, there is an AR information associated with the
   DTLS policy.  There may be an array of pairs binding DTLS policy
   information and AR information contained in the Tunnel DTLS Policy
   Element.  Otherwise, the same Tunnel DTLS Policy (see Figure 14) is
   generally applied for all tunnels associated with the ARs configured
   by the AC.

3.6.4.  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy Element

   In 802.11 networks, IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy Element is used
   to specify how the WTP apply the QoS tagging policy when receiving
   the packets from stations on a particular radio.  When the WTP sends
   out the packet to data channel to the AR(s), the packets have to be
   tagged for QoS purposes (see [RFC5416]).

   The IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy abides the IEEE 802.11 WTP
   Quality of Service defined in Section 6.22 of [RFC5416].

3.6.5.  CAPWAP Transport Protocol Element

   The CAPWAP data tunnel supports both UDP and UDP-Lite (see RFC3828).
   When run over IPv4, UDP is used for the CAPWAP data channels.  When
   run over IPv6, the CAPWAP data channel may use either UDP or UDP-
   lite.  The AC specifies and configure the WTP for which transport
   protocol is to be used for the CAPWAP data tunnel.

   The CAPWAP Transport Protocol Element abides the definition in
   Section 4.6.14 of [RFC5415].

   Transport: The transport to use for the CAPWAP Data channel.  The
   following enumerated values are supported:

   1 - UDP-Lite: The UDP-Lite transport protocol is to be used for the
   CAPWAP Data channel.  Note that this option MUST NOT be used if the
   CAPWAP Control channel is being used over IPv4 and AR address is IPv4
   contained in the AR Information Element.

   2 - UDP: The UDP transport protocol is to be used for the CAPWAP Data
   channel.

3.6.6.  GRE Key Element

   If a WTP receives the GRE Key Element in the Alternate Tunnel
   Encapsulation message element for GREv4 or GREv6 selection, the WTP
   must insert the GRE Key to the encapsulation packet (see [RFC2890]).
   An AR acting as decapsulating tunnel endpoint identifies packets
   belonging to a traffic flow based on the Key value.

   The GRE Key Element field contains a four octet number defined in
   [RFC2890].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA considerations.

   o  <IANA-1>.  This specification defines the Supported Alternate
      Tunnel Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.1.  This
      elements needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message
      Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for
      this element needs to be between 1 and 1023 (see Section 15.7 in
      [RFC5415]).
   o  <IANA-2>.  This specification defines the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.2.  This element
      needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message Element Type
      registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for this element
      needs to be between 1 and 1023.
   o  <IANA-3>.  This specification defines the IEEE 802.11 WTP
      Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element in
      Section 3.3.  This element needs to be registered in the existing
      CAPWAP Message Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The
      Type value for this element needs to be between 1024 and 2047.
   o  Tunnel-Type: This specification defines the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element.  This element contains a
      field Tunnel-Type.  The namespace for the field is 16 bits
      (0-65535)).  This specification defines values, zero (0) through
      six (6) and can be found in Section 3.2.  Future allocations of
      values in this name space are to be assigned by IANA using the
      "Specification Required" policy.  IANA needs to create a registry
      called CAPWAP Alternate Tunnel-Types.  The registry format is
      given below.
   o  AR IPv4 Element Type: AR IPv4 List Element (see Figure 11) is used
      by the AC to configure a WTP with the AR IPv4 address available
      for the WTP to establish the data tunnel for user traffic.
   o  AR IPv6 Element Type: AR IPv6 List Element (see Figure 12) is used
      by the AC to configure a WTP with the AR IPv6 address available
      for the WTP to establish the data tunnel for user traffic.

   o  AR FQDN Element Type: AR FQDN Element (see Figure 13) is used by
      the AC to configure a WTP with AR FQDN available to establish the
      data tunnel for user traffic.
   o  Tunnel DTLS Element Type: The Tunnel DTLS Policy Element obey the
      definition in [RFC5415].
   o  GRE Key Element Type: If a WTP receives the GRE Key Element in the
      Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation message element for GREv4 or GREv6
      selection, the WTP must insert the GRE Key to the encapsulation
      packet

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces three new CAPWAP WTP message elements.
   These elements are transported within CAPWAP Control messages as the
   existing message elements.  Therefore, this document does not
   introduce any new security risks compared to [RFC5415] and [RFC5416].
   In CAPWAP, security for CAPWAP Data Channel is optional and security
   policy is determined by AC.  Similarly, the AC determines the
   security for the Alternate Tunnel between WTP and Alternate Tunnel
   Encapsulation Gateway.  The security considerations described in
   [RFC5415] and [RFC5416] apply here as well.
