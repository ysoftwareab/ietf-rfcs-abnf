1. Introduction 
   
   This document proposes a simple extension to LDP-VPLS [RFC4762] to
   improve bandwidth efficiency for Ethernet broadcast/multicast traffic
   within a carrier's network. 
   
   This bandwidth improvement is achieved by adding unidirectional 
   point-to-multipoint PseudoWires (P2MP PWs) between selected PEs 
   within a VPLS instance.   
  
   The addition of these P2MP PWs is on top of the existing full-mesh of
   point-to-point (P2P) PWs in one VPLS instance.  

2. Problem Statement & Motivation

2.1. Problem Statement

   [RFC5501] provides an in-depth discussion on broadcast/multicast 
   related requirements for VPLS. It highlights two specific issues:
     - Issue A: replication to non-member site.
     - Issue B: replication of PWs on shared physical path. 
   
   If as per [RFC4665] requirement "a L2VPN service SHOULD be agnostic 
   to customer's Layer 3 traffic" and no Layer 3 information is checked
   for transport, this becomes an impediment to solve Issue A.

   Issue B on the other hand can still be improved without making use of
   Layer-3-related information.
 
   Issue B may still be considered acceptable when:
     - Ethernet broadcast/multicast traffic volume is low; and  
     - The number of replications on each outgoing physical interface 
       for a VPLS instance is small (e.g. not many PEs per VPLS 
       instance).

   However, with more broadcast/multicast applications (e.g. broadcast 
   TV), Ethernet broadcast/multicast traffic volume may increase to a 
   significant level. Assuming HDTV requires 10Mbps per channel, a 
   bundle of 100 channels will require 1Gbps. 

   Furthermore, as MPLS networks expand from the core towards 
   aggregation/access, more PEs may participate in a single VPLS 
   instance. The number of replications on each outgoing physical 
   interface for a VPLS instance is likely to increase.

2.2. Motivation

   Based on the previous section, it may still be desirable for some 
   carriers to look at improving Issue B without having to look at Layer
   3 IP information (Issue A).

   One reason for this is that sometimes there is no Layer 3 data to 
   snoop. Another reason may be that some carriers may not be allowed to 
   look above the Layer 2 header, for example there may be regulatory 
   issues with inspecting the customer payload. Also, some carriers may 
   want to avoid Layer 3 snooping simply because of the lack of Layer 3 
   operational knowledge and the potential complexities associated with 
   it.

   Another important point is that some carriers may want a manual and
   selective optimisation process that does not impact network elements
   not part of it. For example, the bandwidth improvement process may 
   only be required at specific locations in the network where big 
   Ethernet broadcast/multicast talkers exist. Another reason may be 
   that some network elements do not support a specific feature and 
   therefore cannot be selected as part of the optimisation process.

   Finally, some carriers may also prefer a deterministic process to an
   entirely automated path selection algorithm that is network driven. 
   The main reason being that operations may become more complicated if
   they do not control in a completely predictable fashion what is 
   happening on the network.

   [VPLS-Multicast-BGP] is a solution that looks at solving both Issue A
   and Issue B. However, [VPLS-Multicast-BGP] proposes that, even for 
   carriers who currently use [RFC4762] without auto-discovery 
   mechanisms, BGP be introduced (section 7). This may also present 
   operational challenges and complexities for some carriers, or this 
   feature may simply not be supported on some of the network elements
   deployed.

   This draft therefore explores whether there is a way to improve Layer 
   2 Ethernet broadcast/multicast bandwidth simply and predictably (i.e.
   single coverage of receiver membership and Layer 3 IP agnostic) with:
     - minimal extension to [RFC4762] and without the need to add BGP
     - minimal impact to existing [RFC4762] deployed networks
     - operator driven optimisation (i.e. the operator decides where and 
       how the bandwidth improvement should occur).

3. Terminology

   This document uses terminology described in [RFC4762] and 
   [P2MP-PW-REQ].

4. Relevant IETF technologies for the proposed solution  

   The proposed solution relies on [RFC4762] existing mechanisms and 
   complements them with extensions (P2MP LSPs and P2MP PWs) already
   standardised ([RFC4875]) or currently under development by the IETF
   ([mLDP] and [P2MP-PW-LDP]).

4.1. P2MP LSPs
   
   Similarly to what is defined in [RFC4762] where P2P PWs are 
   multiplexed onto P2P LSPs, before the operator can start deploying 
   P2MP PWs, an appropriate underlying layer made of P2MP LPSs needs to 
   be configured (section 3.2 of [P2MP-PW-REQ]). 

   P2MP LSPs are used to minimise packet replication on specific 
   physical links and to allow P routers in an MPLS domain to be 
   transparent to services (e.g. a P Router will join the P2MP PSN 
   tunnel operation but will have no knowledge of the P2MP PWs, same as 
   [RFC4762]).

   The mapping of the P2MP LSP on top of the physical topology is a 
   key component of the bandwidth enhancement exercise and the operator
   needs to carefully consider where and how these P2MP LSPs should be 
   deployed (see Appendix A for an example of a possible deployment).

   Once configured, these P2MP LSPs can then be shared by several P2MP 
   PWs (similar to P2P LSP and P2P PW in [RFC4762]).
   
4.2. P2MP PWs 

   P2MP PWs can be statically or dynamically configured on top of the 
   P2MP LSPs. This configuration is done on a per PE per VPLS instance 
   basis.
   
   In a P2MP PW, the operator decides to connect one Root PE to at least 
   two Leaf PEs (section 3.1 of [P2MP-PW-REQ]). 

   The Root PE is the headend of the P2MP PW (where a big Ethernet 
   broadcast/multicast talker is connected - see example in Appendix A).
  
   The Leaf PEs are the endpoints of the P2MP PW (they constitute the 
   receivers where the broadcast/multicast traffic needs to be 
   distributed to).
        
   A Root PE may map more than one P2MP PW to a specific VPLS instance. 
   In this case, the Root PE MUST NOT associate a leaf PE to more than
   one P2MP PW for a specific VPLS instance (this is to avoid a Leaf PE 
   to receive duplicate copies of the same Ethernet frame from different
   P2MP PWs).     
   
   P2MP PWs are defined in [P2MP-PW-REQ] and one dynamic solution is
   defined in [P2MP-PW-LDP].

   Note that for sake of clarity, Figure 2 does not show the full-mesh 
   of P2P PWs presented in Figure 1.

   Also note that the solution does not require that P2MP PWs be used on
   all PEs in the VPLS instance, for example there is only a P2P PW 
   between PE1 and PE3 and a P2P PW between PE2 and PE4.

5.2. Choosing PEs for a specific VPLS to be connected by a P2MP PW for a
     specific VPLS instance

   This updates section 4.3 of [RFC4762]. 

   VPLS is a full-mesh of P2P PWs and optionally a number of 
   unidirectional P2MP PWs. For each P2MP PW on this VPLS instance:
     - The operator selects one PE as the Root of the P2MP PW.
     - A subset or all of the other PEs belonging to the same VPLS 
       instance are chosen to be Leafs of the P2MP PW. 
     - The P2MP PW is unidirectional only (e.g. from the Root PE to all 
       the Leaf PEs connected to it).

5.3. Create and map the P2MP PW to a specific VPLS instance 

   This updates section 4.3 of [RFC4762] and when LDP is used as a 
   dynamic way of signalling P2MP PWs, section 6.1 of [RFC4762] will 
   need to be updated with section 4 of [P2MP-PW-LDP]. 

   P2MP PWs are signalled to demultiplex encapsulated Ethernet frames 
   from multiple VPLS instances that traverse the P2MP transport LSPs.

   Both the creation and the mapping of P2MP PWs can be done manually 
   or dynamically. 

   An example of dynamic creation/mapping is described in [P2MP-PW-LDP].

5.4. Mapping more than one P2MP PW to a specific VPLS instance on a 
     specific Root PE
 
   The proposed solution allows for a Root PE to map more than one P2MP
   PW to a specific VPLS instance (see example in Appendix A).

   However in this case, the Root PE MUST NOT associate a leaf PE to 
   more than one P2MP PW for a specific VPLS instance (this is to avoid
   a Leaf PE to receive duplicate copies of the same Ethernet frame from
   different P2MP PWs).

5.5. Flooding and Forwarding 
   
   This section updates section 4.1 of [RFC4762].

   For flooding of a Ethernet broadcast/multicast frame over PWs to 
   remote PEs participating in the VPLS:
     - If there is P2MP PW towards a remote PE, the P2P PW associated 
       with this remote PE will not be used. One copy of the frame will 
       be forwarded on the P2MP PW for all the remote PEs associated 
       with it.
     - If there is no P2MP PW towards a remote PE, the P2P PW associated 
       with this remote PE is used.   

5.5.1. Flooding and Forwarding for Ethernet unknown unicast

   In traditional Ethernet switched networks unknown unicast frames are
   handled the same way as broadcast and multicast Ethernet traffic 
   (e.g. flooding). Similarly, current VPLS standards also handle 
   unknown unicast traffic by flooding it across all P2P PWs. 

   The purpose of this document is to address Ethernet broadcast and 
   multicast traffic. For Ethernet unknown unicast frames there are
   two possibilities:
     - forward the unknown unicast traffic on the P2MP PW, same as for 
       Ethernet broadcast and multicast.
     - keep the existing mechanism of [RFC4762] and flood the unknown 
       unicast over the P2P PWs.
 
   Details on how Ethernet unknown unicast traffic should be handled 
   will be added in a future revision of this document.

5.6. Address Learning 

   This section updates section 4.2 of [RFC4762].

   When a Leaf PE receives an Ethernet frame on a P2MP PW it:
     - First determines the Root PE of the P2MP PW 
     - Then determines the P2P PW associated with that Root PE
     - Finally, creates a forwarding state in the VPLS instance for the 
       P2P PW associated with the Root PE with a destination MAC address 
       being the same as the source MAC address being learned.
 
5.7. Loop Free Topology

   This updates section 4.4 of [RFC4762]

   Paragraph 2 "must not forward from one PW to another" is applicable
   to P2MP PW & P2P PW.

5.8. Hierarchical VPLS
   
   H-VPLS considerations will be added in a later revision.  

6. Security Considerations 
    
   This section will be added in a future version.

   Figure 3 is split in three logical components:
     - The Core network composed of P1, P2, P3 & P4. These 4 network 
       elements are P routers connected in a ring.
     - The Data Centers. These are a few large PoPs with high resiliency 
       that hold the video content. PE1 & PE2 are located in one Data 
       Center and are dual-homed to the core network. An Ethernet 
       broadcast source is connected to each PE in the Data Center.
     - The Aggregation network. The Aggregation network is responsible 
       for aggregating last mile technology towards end-users (direct 
       fiber, GPON, DSL, etc.). PE3, PE4, until PE14 are VPLS PE 
       routers, single-homed to the Core network. 

   There are two different video distribution services organised as 
   follows:
     - VPLS instance-1 (VPLS-1): PE1 is connected to PE3, PE4 ... PE14.
     - One Ethernet broadcast source is connected to PE1 into VPLS-1.
     - VPLS instance-2 (VPLS-2): PE2 is connected to PE3, PE4 ... PE14.
     - One Ethernet broadcast source is connected to PE2 into VPLS-2.

A.2. Impact of Physical Topologies on Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast 
     Replication

   Following the standard VPLS ingress replication mechanism, each time
   PE1 receives one broadcast frame from the Ethernet broadcast source 
   on VPLS-1, PE1 will replicate 12 times the incoming frame.

   Similarly, each time PE2 receives one broadcast frame from the 
   Ethernet broadcast source on VPLS-2, PE2 will replicate 12 times the
   incoming frame. 

A.3. Proposed Enhancement of Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast

   The proposed enhancements are done in three steps:
     - create P2MP LSPs for the infrastructure. These P2MP LSPs are used 
       to carry one or more P2MP PWs.
     - create unidrectional P2MP PWs by selectively chosing PEs where 
       the optimisation should occur.
     - forward Ethernet broadcast/multicast frames onto the P2MP PWs 
       where these P2MP PWs have been created.

   It is up to the network operator to decide how the distribution of 
   the loading on physical link should occur. 

   Two different examples are presented below.

Internet Draft         Ext to LDP-VPLS for Broadcast          May 2010 


A.3.1 One Possible Enhancement Scenario

   In this scenario, the operator decides to create the following P2MP
   LSPs:

     - PE1->PE3-5 via P1 called LSP1
     - PE1->PE6-8 via P2 called LSP2
     - PE1->PE9-11 via P3 called LSP3     

     - PE2->PE3-5 via P1 called LSP4
     - PE2->PE6-8 via P2 called LSP5
     - PE2->PE9-11 via P3 called LSP6

   The operator then creates the following P2MP PWs:

     - For VPLS-1, PE1->PE3-5 via P2MP PW1 over LSP1
     - For VPLS-1, PE1->PE6-8 via P2MP PW2 over LSP2
     - For VPLS-1, PE1->PE9-11 via P2MP PW3 over LSP3
   
     - For VPLS-2, PE2->PE3-5 via P2MP PW4 over LSP4
     - For VPLS-2, PE2->PE6-8 via P2MP PW5 over LSP5
     - For VPLS-2, PE2->PE9-11 via P2MP PW6 over LSP6

   There is no P2MP PW between PE1 and PE12, PE13 and PE14.
   There is no P2MP PW between PE2 and PE12, PE13 and PE14.
    
   There are some possible reasons why a P2MP PW may not be available on 
   this part of the network (PE12, PE13 and PE14), for example:
     - the hardware/software may not allow the support of the required 
       features (P2MP LSPs and/or P2MP PWs).
     - the operator is currently under a migration phase where only part 
       of the network is migrated at a time.

   In this case, when PE1 receives one broadcast frame from the Ethernet 
   broadcast source on VPLS-1:
      - PE1 sends one copy onto P2MP PW1
      - PE1 sends one copy onto P2MP PW2
      - PE1 sends one copy onto P2MP PW3
      - PE1 sends one copy onto the P2P PW towards PE12
      - PE1 sends one copy onto the P2P PW towards PE13
      - PE1 sends one copy onto the P2P PW towards PE14

   PE1 only replicates 6 copies now (this is an improvement from 12 
   copies if only using P2P PWs).

   Similar improvement for VPLS-2.

A.3.2. Another Possible Enhancement Scenario

   In this scenario, the operator decides to create the following two 
   P2MP LSPs:

     - PE1-> PE3-14 via LSP1:
            - P1 as a branch towards PE3, PE4, PE5, P2 and P3
            - P2 as a branch towards PE6, PE7, PE8 and P4
            - P3 as a branch towards PE9, PE10 and PE11
            - P4 as a branch towards PE12, PE13 and PE14 
  
     - PE2-> PE3-14 via LSP2:
            - P2 as a branch towards PE6, PE7, PE8, P1 and P4
            - P1 as a branch towards PE3, PE4, PE5 and P3
            - P3 as a branch towards PE9, PE10 and PE11
            - P4 as a branch towards PE12, PE13 and PE14 

   The operator then creates the following P2MP PWs:

     - For VPLS-1, PE1-> PE3-14 via P2MP PW1 over LSP1
     - For VPLS-2, PE2-> PE3-14 via P2MP PW2 over LSP2
 
   This case improves the P2P PW scenario as PE1 only forwards a single 
   copy of the broadcast frame received from the Ethernet broadcast 
   source on VPLS-1.

   Similar improvement for VPLS-2.
