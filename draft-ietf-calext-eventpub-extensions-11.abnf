orderparam    = "ORDER" "=" integer ;Must be greater than or equal to 1

   Description:  The ORDER parameter is OPTIONAL and is used to indicate
      the relative ordering of the corresponding instance of a property.
      Its value MUST be an integer greater than or equal to 1 that
      quantifies the order with 1 being the first in the ordering.

      When the parameter is absent, the default MUST be to interpret the
      property instance as being at the lowest level of ordering, that
      is, the property will appear after any other instances of the same
      property with any value of ORDER.

      When any ORDER parameters have the same value all the associated
      properties appear as a group within which there is no defined
      order.

      Note that the value of this parameter is to be interpreted only in
      relation to values assigned to other corresponding instances of
      the same property in the same entity.  A given value, or the
      absence of a value, MUST NOT be interpreted on its own.

      This parameter MAY be applied to any property that allows multiple
      instances.
