Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet Community.  In particular, it defines objects used for
   the management of applications.  This MIB complements the System
   Application MIB, providing for the management of applications' common
   attributes which could not typically be observed without the
   cooperation of the software being managed.

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB           5 March 1998


1.  Introduction

   This document furthers the work begun in the systems application mib
   [10].

   The development of [1], [2], [3], [4],  and [8] provides us with a
   base of experience in making a variety of applications visible to
   management; this specification abstracts out the common aspects of
   applications management and provides a generic base usable for the
   management of almost any application.

2.  Overview

   Due to the design decision to not require application
   instrumentation, many important topics were not handled in system
   application MIB [10].  The following topics are within the scope of
   this document:

          -      Support for generic application throughput
                 measurements;

          -      Providing MIB definitions that allow managed entities
                 to report what they considered to be units of work;

          -      Providing support for generic application response time
                 monitoring capabilities;

          -      Provide explicit support for the management of
                 applications distributed within a single managed system
                 ("local" distribution);

          -      Address generic resource management issues, including:

                 -      files in use;

                 -      I/O statistics (from the application's
                        perspective, not at the operating system or
                        device driver level);

                 -      application-layer networking resource usage

                 -      Providing access to dependency information, both
                        in the form of MIB objects to report
                        dependencies on "mission critical" processes, as
                        well as the logging of failures due to
                        dependencies.

          -      Provide a generic logging (stderr) capability:

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB           5 March 1998


                 -      Identify common log entries of use with multiple
                        applications;

                 -      Permit use of specialized log entries where
                        appropriate;

                 -      Provide generic facility for the management of
                        this log;

                 -      Provide generic facility to control notification
                        generation by the application;

          -      Facilities for the control of applications, including:

                 -      Starting and stopping applications and their
                        elements;

                 -      Suspending and resuming applications and their
                        elements;

                 -      Configuration of application parameters;

                 -      A "mission critical process" MIB to identify
                        processes that are of particular interest;

                 -      Reconfiguration (e.g., SIGHUP) request
                        capability.

   Note that these issues are addressed at least in part by other (non-
   IETF) standards work, including [11] and [12].

   Some topics were identified as being of interest to the applmib
   working group, but outside the scope of this document.

          -      Providing MIB definitions that allow management to
                 define what is to be considered an error.  This
                 includes mechanisms for filtering and selective
                 forwarding of information from notifications or log
                 entries.

   Topics identified as specifically out of scope include:

          -      Providing MIB definitions to allow dynamic control of
                 the definition of units of work;

          -      Explicit support for the management of applications
                 distributed across multiple systems; (The indexing
                 structure and semantics of the system application MIB

                 [10] are not sufficient for this task.)

          -      Issues of backup and recovery;

          -      Issues of software request, delivery, installation,
                 activation, patching, version update, reversion, and
                 removal;

          -      Issues of software validation and integrity checks;

          -      Issues of software licensing.

3.  Architecture

   Object-oriented modeling techniques like subclassing and multiple
   inheritance can be emulated in the SNMP information model through the
   use of tables with common indexes.

   The challenge for the developer of management applications is to
   recognize those situations in which various aspects of a single
   logical resource are represented in several different tables,
   possibly defined in different MIBs.

   Most of the management information defined here may pertain to any
   number of applications in a managed system.  The simplest way of
   supporting this requirement within the SNMP information model is to
   use tables.  This means that the management information for a
   particular resource may be found in one or more rows of one or more
   tables; the fact that this information pertains to a single resource
   may be inferred from the index values used, possibly with the support
   of mapping tables.  This also means that a single table may contain
   management information relevant to a number of applications.  This
   has significant implementation implications; see the implementation
   issues section below for more information.

3.1.  Relationships to other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationships of the components of this MIB
   (usually in the form of common indexing structures) to:

          -      the systems applications MIB [10]

          -      the host resources MIB [1]

          -      the network services monitoring MIB [2]






Applmib Working Group       Expires May 1998                    [Page 5]

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB           5 March 1998


3.1.1.  Relationship to the System Application MIB

   The system application MIB defines attributes for management of
   applications which can be realized without instrumenting the
   application itself.  This specification extends that framework to
   include additional attributes which will typically require
   instrumentation within the managed resource.  The sysApplRunElmtIndex
   is the key connection between these two MIBs; it is essential that
   implementations of this MIB and of the system applications MIB
   running concurrently on a given platform employ a consistent policy
   for assigning this value to identify running application elements.

3.1.2.  Relationship to the Host Resources MIB

   The Host Resources MIB [1] supplies information on the hardware,
   operating system, installed and running software on a host.

   The Host Resources MIB has three hardware groups ("hrSystem",
   "hrStorage" and "hrDevice") and three software groups ("hrSWRun",
   "hrSWRunPerf" and "hrSWInstalled").  Of these, the software groups
   are of greatest significance to this MIB.

   The software groups define management information on the software
   used in the system. The information provided is grouped into (1) the
   currently running, (2) the performance and (3) the installed
   applications.

   The index "hrSWRunIndex" used in the "hrSWRunTable" and other tables
   to identify running software by process identifier (or equivalent)
   relates information in the Host Resources MIB to information in the
   System Applications MIB and this MIB.  It is essential that the
   values assigned to hrSWRunIndex from the Host Resources MIB be
   consistant with the values used for sysApplRunElmtIndex.

3.1.3.  Relationship to NSM

   The Network Services Monitoring MIB [2] is defined as the base set of
   attributes for managing network applications.  The Application MIB
   includes information normally obtainable only from the managed
   resource itself, rather than the supporting system.  Due to
   differences in index representation, the relationship between the
   Network Services Monitoring MIB and the Application MIB is not
   formally defined.

4.  MIB Structure

   This MIB is organized into several groups, which in turn are
   organized into tables to provide the monitoring and control of



Applmib Working Group       Expires May 1998                    [Page 6]

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB           5 March 1998


   information relevant to the management of applications.  The groups
   model:

          -      the service-level view of applications

          -      information on open files in use by applications

          -      information on open connections in use by applications

          -      historical information on former connections

          -      transaction-level information

          -      process-level status and control information

   These groups are organized into various tables.  Information for a
   particular running managed application appears in the form of entries
   in the appropriate tables.  The tables are:

          -      the tables providing a service-level view, including:

                 -      the service name to service instance table

                 -      the service instance to service name table

                 -      the service instance to running application
                        element table

                 -      the running application element to service
                        instance table

          -      the table providing information on open files

          -      the open connections table

          -      the connection history table

          -      the transaction statistics tables

          -      the running application element status and control
                 group

                 -      the running application element status table

                 -      the running application element control table

   In order to support SNMPv1, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3 environments, in cases
   where counter objects may potentially advance very rapidly, where



Applmib Working Group       Expires May 1998                    [Page 7]

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB           5 March 1998


   sixty-four bit counters have been used thirty-two bit counters
   reporting the low-order thrity-two bits of the value have also been
   defined.

   Since rows in most of these tables will come and go with the running
   application elements whose information is contained in them,
   sysUpTime.0 is not appropriate as a discontinuity indicator for
   counters in these tables.  By defining separate discontinuity
   indicators for the rows in these tables, entries can come and go as
   needed without causing other objects to appear to have
   discontinuities.  As required by [5], the discontinuity indicators
   for the various information objects in these tables are identified in
   the relevant DESCRIPTION clauses.  Note that a discontinuity in one
   of these counters does not imply a sysUpTime.0 discontinuity, nor
   does a sysUpTime.0 discontinuity imply a discontinuity in any of
   these counters.

4.1.  The service-level tables

   The service-level tables permit the identification of one or more
   instances of named services on a system, and the association of
   running application elements to these services.

   Service names are represented as human-readable strings, using values
   assigned by IANA where possible.  The allocation of unique values for
   service instance identifiers is a local administrative issue; the
   values allocated must be constant for the lifetime of the service
   instance, and re-use of values should be avoided.

   It is important to understand that a service is not the same thing as
   a protocol.  Rather, some services may be at least partialyl
   described by the protocol(s) used to provide that service.

   In deciding what should or should not be considered a service, the
   following factors merit consideration:

          -      is there an identifiable set of resources associated
                 with providing this service?

          -      is there a reasonably long-lived server or client
                 process?

   Following this reasoning, one can see where SMTP and HTTP service
   providers would be good candidates for classification as services for
   purposes of application management, where finger probably would not.
   Of course, implementors of this MIB are free to define additional
   services.  An applicability statement may be an appropriate vehicle
   for standardizing how a specific service's information is reported

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB           5 March 1998


   using this MIB.

4.1.1.  The service name to service instance table

   The service name to service instance table uses the service name as
   its primary key, and the service instance identifier as its secondary
   key.  It facilitates the identification and lookup of the instances a
   given service in a system.

4.1.2.  The service instance to service name table

   The service instance to service name table uses the service instance
   identifier as its primary key, and the service name as its secondary
   key.  Given a service instance identifier, it facilitates the lookup
   of the name of the service being provided.

4.1.3.  The service instance to running application element table

   The service instance to running application element table uses the
   service instance identifier as its primary key, and the running
   application element index as its secondary key.  This facilitates the
   identification of the set of running application elements providing a
   given instance of a service.

4.1.4.  The running application element to service instance table

   The running application element to service instance table uses the
   running application element index as its primary key and the service
   instance identifier as its secondary key.  It identifies the set of
   services provided by a given running application element.

4.2.  The open files table

   The open files table contains one entry for each file in use by a
   manageable running application element.  (See [10] for a detailed
   definition of a running application element.)  The purpose of this
   table is to identify the files in use and to record I/O activity on
   each file attributable to a particular running application element.

   If multiple running application elements open the same file, there
   will be an entry for each running application element opening that
   file.  Similarly, if a running application element opens a file
   multiple times, there will be an entry in this table for the file
   corresponding to each open.

   The task of combining the information for file activity from this
   table (organized by running application element) into per-application
   statistics can be accomplished by a manager using the System

   Application MIB's [10] sysApplInstallPkgTable to find the installed
   application, the sysApplRunTable to find the running instances of
   that application, and the sysApplElmtRunTable to find the relevant
   values of sysApplElmtRunIndex.  The manager, armed with a set of
   values for sysApplElmtRunIndex, is now able to retrieve the relevant
   portions of the applOpenFileTable and other tables in this MIB.

   Entries in this table are indexed by the application run index and an
   arbitrary integer, chosen so that taken together the application run
   index and this integer yield a unique key for each open file.  The
   following information is available in this table:

          -      file name

          -      number of read requests

          -      number of bytes read

          -      time at which most recent read operation was initiated

          -      number of write requests

          -      number of bytes written

          -      time at which most recent write operation was initiated

          -      file size

          -      current mode (read/write) of this file

   Special cases to consider: stdin, stdout, stderr, etc. may require
   some special handling.

4.3.  The open connections table

   This table provides information on each open connection of an
   application element.  It is indexed by the application element and
   the connection identifier.  The following information is available
   for each connection:

          -      time at which the connection was opened

          -      identification of the transport protocol in use

          -      near-end address and port

          -      far-end address and port

          -      identification of the application layer protocol in use

          -      number of read requests

          -      number of bytes received

          -      time at which the most recent read request was
                 initiated

          -      number of write requests

          -      number of bytes transmitted

          -      time at which most recent write request was initiated

4.4.  The former connection group

   The former connection group consists of two tables: the former
   connection table and the former connection control table.

4.4.1.  The former connection control table

   The former connection control table provides per-process control over
   the accumulation of information on former connections.  For each
   process, this table, indexed by the application element run index,
   controls whether information on former connections is accumulated,
   how many of these history records are retained, how long these are
   retained (within the lifetime of the process), and a count of history
   entries that were deleted before their expiration time in order to
   make room for new entries.

4.4.2.  The former connection table

   The former connection table provides historical information on
   connections that have been closed.  The number and lifetime of these
   entries is controlled, on a per-process basis, by the former
   connection control table.  Most of the information in this table
   corresponds to information in the open connection table.

4.5.  The transaction group

   The transaction statistics group has three tables.  The transaction
   summary table contains per-stream summaries of transaction
   statistics.  The transaction flow statistics table contains
   statistics broken into both transmit and receive counts for requests
   and responses on each stream.  The transaction kind statistics table
   contains information further broken down by transaction kind.

   Entries in the the tables in this group have a common structure for
   their indexing, with additional indexes added for increasing detail.
   All of these tables are indexed by the application element run index
   and an arbitrary integer, chosen so that taken together the
   application run index and this integer yield a unique key for each
   transaction stream associated with the running application element.
   A transaction stream may be a file or a connection; a column in the
   transaction summary table contains the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the
   instance of applOpenConnectionOpenTime or applOpenFileOpenTime, in
   the open files table or open connections table respectively.

4.5.1.  The transaction summary table

   The transaction summary table contains per-stream summaries of
   transaction statistics.  The information represented in this table
   includes:

          -      identification of the underlying connection or file
                 used for this transaction stream

          -      a human-readable description of this stream

          -      a human-readable description of this stream's notion of
                 what a unit of work is

          -      the cumulative amount of time spent (as an operation
                 invoker) waiting for responses (from queueing of
                 request to arrival of first response)

          -      the cumulative amount of time spent (as an operation
                 invoker) receiving responses (time from the arrival of
                 the first response to the arrival of the last response
                 in a series of responses to a particular request)

          -      the cumulative amount of time spent (as an operation
                 performer) handling requests (time from receipt of
                 request to queueing of first outgoing response)

          -      the cumulative amount of time spent (as an operation
                 performer) sending responses  (time from queuing of
                 first response to the last response in a series of
                 responses to a particular request)

          -      a time stamp for use as a discontinuity indicator in
                 related rows in this group

4.5.2.  The transaction flow statistics table

   The transaction flow statistics table contains statistics broken into
   both transmit and receive counts for requests and responses on each
   stream.  In addition to the running application element and
   transaction stream identifier indexes, rows in this table are indexed
   by flow direction (transmit or receive) and role (requests and
   responses).  The information in this table includes:

          -      the number of transactions processed

          -      the number of bytes processed

          -      the time at which the most recent transaction was
                 processed in this flow

4.5.3.  The transaction kind statistics table

   The transaction kind statistics table contains summary information
   organized by direction, request/response, and transaction kind for
   each stream.  The indexing of this table is like that of the
   transaction flow table, with the addition of a transaction kind
   index.

          -      number of transactions processed

          -      number of bytes processed

          -      the time at which the most recent transaction of this
                 kind in this direction in this stream was processed

4.6.  The running element status and control group

   The running application element status and control group has two
   tables.

4.6.1.  The running application element status table

   This table provides information for a running application element.
   Indexed by the sysApplElmtRunIndex, an entry in this table reports
   useful information on that running element's resource usage.  Entries
   in this table contain:

          -      current heap usage for this running application element

          -      current number of open network connections for this
                 running application element

          -      the most recent error message issued by this running
                 application element

   Note that other information, such as the current number of open files
   for this running application element, is available from the
   sysapplElmtRunTable in [10].

4.6.2.  The running application element control table

   This table provides rudimentary control over a running application
   element.  Indexed by the sysApplElmtRunIndex, an entry in this table
   gives a manager with appropriate permissions the ability to suspend
   and resume processing by this running element, the ability to request
   reconfiguration, and the ability to terminate the running element.

   Variables in this table include:

          -      a suspend/resume control

          -      a reconfiguration request control

          -      a termination request control

              Entries for closed connections for a given running
              application element can be added to this table only

              Entries for closed connections are removed under
              the following circumstances:

                   - the running application element no longer
                     exists

                   - the corresponding
                     applPastConControlCollect attribute

                     indicated by the corresponding
                     applPastConControlTimeLimit and the
                     value of applPastConControlCollect is

                   - this is the oldest entry for the running
                     application element in question and the

                   - a value of applPastConId has been re-
                     used.  Note that under normal circumstances,
                     this is unlikely.

              Removal/replacement of an entry under the

              The simple model of a transaction used here looks

                            |               |

              Since in some protocols it is possible for an entity
              to take on both the invoker and performer roles,
              information here is accumulated for transmitted
              and received requests, as well as for transmitted
              and received responses.  Counts are maintained

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB           5 March 1998


6.  Implementation Issues

   Unlike the system application MIB [10], in many environments support
   for much of this MIB requires instrumentation built into the managed
   resource.  Some tables may be implemented by a single monitor
   process; for others, the implementation may be distributed within the
   managed system with the resources being managed.

   As a practical matter, this means that the management infrastructure
   of the managed system must support different subagents taking
   responsibility for different rows of a single table.  This can be
   supported by AgentX [13], as well as some other subagent protocols
   such as [14], [15], and .ID 2.

   The sysApplRunElmtIndex is the key connection between this MIB and
   the systems application MIB.  Implementations of these two MIBs
   intended to run concurrently on a given platform must employ a
   consistent policy for assigning this value to running application
   elements.

   Some of the objects defined in this MIB may carry a high run-time
   cost in some environments.  For example, tracking transaction elapsed
   time could be expensive if it required two kernel calls (start and
   finish) per transaction.  Similarly, maintaining tables of per-
   transaction information, rather than aggregating information by
   transaction type or transaction stream, could have significant
   storage and performance impacts.

   Unless a collision-free mechanism for allocating service instance
   indexes is in place, the structure of the service-level tables makes
   an index-reservation mechanism necessary.  AgentX [13] is an example
   of a subagent protocol capable of satisfying this requirement.

9.  Security Considerations

   By making potentially sensitive information externally accessible,
   the capabilities supported by the MIB have the potential of becoming
   security problems.

   The tables in this MIB are organized to separate sensitive control
   capabilities from less sensitive usage information.  For example, the
   objects to control application suspend/resume are separated from
   those to handle reconfiguration, which in turn are distinct from
   those for termination.  This recognizes the need to support
   configurations where the level of authorization needed by a manager
   to do a "reconfigure" might be substantially less than the level
   needed to terminate an application element.  By keeping these in
   separate columns, we make it possible to set up access control that
   allows, for example, "reconfigure" but not "kill".

   The MIB is structured to be useful for managers with read-only access
   rights.

   The capabilities supported by this MIB include several that may be of
   value to a security administrator.  These include the ability to
   monitor the level of usage of a given application, and to check the
   integrity of application components.

12.  Issues and List of Things Left To Be Done

   The following issues remain to be resolved.

          -      The text describing what a service is needs work.  In
                 particular, it needs to be better distinguished from
                 protocol.  Might the svrloc work be of help?

          -      A TDomain value for TCP needs to be defined somewhere.

          -      At Munich there was general agreement that it would be
                 desirable to be able to access (aggregated) transaction
                 statistics organized by service instance.  Can this
                 somehow be collapsed with the current tables?

          -      Need further discussion of order of indexes on
                 transaction flow and transaction kind tables.  Has
                 implications for both access control and for bulk
                 retrieval.

          -      Should applOpenConnectionApplication be a human-
                 readable thing or something like an RMON protocol
                 identifier?

          -      Decide which object definitions should be borrowed or
                 reference from the ARM work.

          -      The syntax for the identifiers for transport and
                 application protocol identifiers should be narrowed
                 down a bit.

          -      MIB definitions to support the following capabilities
                 are still needed:

                 -      dependency information

                 -      logging capability

          -      add conformance clauses

          -      should control capabilities be defined at an
                 application, service, or process level in this MIB?
