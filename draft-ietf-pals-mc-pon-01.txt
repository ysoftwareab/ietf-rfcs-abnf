Abstract

   MPLS is being deployed deeper into operator networks, often to or
   past the access network node. Separately network access nodes such
   as PON OLTs have evolved to support first-mile access protection,
   where one or more physical OLTs provide first-mile diversity to the
   customer edge. Multi-homing support is needed on the MPLS-enabled
   PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided services.  This document
   describes the multi-chassis PON protection architecture in MPLS and
   also proposes the ICCP extension to support it.

3. Introduction

   MPLS is being extended to the edge of operator networks, as is
   described in the seamless MPLS use cases [SEAMLESS-MPLS], and the
   MS-PW with PON access use case [RFC6456]. Combining MPLS with OLT
   access further facilitates a low cost multi-service convergence.

   Tens of millions of FTTx lines have been deployed over the years,
   with many of those lines being some PON variant. PON provides
   operators a cost-effective solution for delivering high bandwidth
   (1Gbps or even 10Gbps) to a dozen or more subscribers simultaneously.

   In the past, access technologies such as Passive Optical Network
   (PON) and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) are usually used for
   subscribers, and no redundancy is provided in their deployment.

   But with the rapid growth of mobile data traffic, more and more LTE
   small cells and Wi-Fi hotspots are deployed. PON is considered as a
   viable low cost backhaul solution for these mobile services. Besides
   its high bandwidth and scalability, PON further provides
   synchronization features, e.g., SyncE [G.8261] and IEEE 1588v2
   [IEEE-1588] functionality, which can fulfill synchronization needs
   of mobile backhaul services.

   The Broadband Forum specifies reference architecture for mobile
   backhaul network using MPLS transport in [TR-221] where PON can be
   the access technology, and is further working on PON-based mobile
   backhaul network architecture in [SD-331].

   Unlike typical residential service where a single or handful of end-
   users hangs off of a single PON OLT port in a physical optical
   distribution network, a PON port that supports a dozen LTE small
   cells or Wi-Fi hotspots could be providing service to hundreds of
   simultaneous subscribers. Small cell backhaul often demands the
   economics of a PON first-mile and yet expects first-mile protection
   commonly available in point-to-point access portfolio.

   Some optical layer of protection mechanisms, such as Trunk and Tree
   protection, are specified in [IEEE-1904.1] to avoid single point of
   failure in the access. They are called Type B and Type C protection
   respectively in [G983.1].

   Trunk protection architecture is an economical PON resiliency
   mechanism, where the working OLT and the working link between the
   working splitter port and the working OLT (i.e., the working trunk
   fiber) is protected by a redundant protection OLT and a redundant
   trunk fiber between the protection splitter port and the protection
   OLT, however it only protects a portion of the optical path from OLT
   to ONUs. This is different from the more complex and costly Type C
   protection architecture where there is a working optical
   distribution network path from the working OLT and a complete
   protected optical distribution network path from the protection OLT
   to the ONUs. Figure 1 demonstrates a typical scenario of Trunk
   protection.

               Figure 1 Trunk Protection Architecture in PON

   Besides small cell backhaul, this protection architecture can also
   be applicable to other services, for example, DSL and Multi-System
   Operator (MSO) services. In that case, an ONU in Figure 1 can play
   the similar role as a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer
   (DSLAM) and dozens of Customer Premises Equipments (CPEs) or cable
   modems may be attached to it.

   In some deployments, it is also possible that only some ONUs are
   needed to be protected.

   The PON architecture depicted in Figure 1 can provide redundancy in
   its physical topology, however, all traffic including link OAM are
   blocked on the protection link which frustrates end to end
   protection mechanisms such as ITU-T G.8031 [G.8031]. Therefore, some
   standard signaling mechanisms are needed between OLTs to exchange
   information, for example, PON link status, registered ONU
   information, and network status, so that protection and restoration
   can be done both rapidly and reliably, especially when the OLTs also
   support MPLS.

   ICCP [ICCP] provides a framework for inter-chassis synchronization
   of state and configuration data between a set of two or more PEs.
   Currently ICCP only defines application specific messages for PW
   redundancy and mLACP, but it can be easily extended to support PON
   as an Attachment Circuit (AC) redundancy.

   This document proposes the extension of ICCP to support Multi-
   chassis PON protection in MPLS.

5. PON ONU Database Synchronization

   Without an effective mechanism to communicate the registered ONUs
   between the working and protection OLT, all registered ONUs would be
   de-registered and go through re-registration during a switchover,
   which would significantly increase protection time. To enable faster
   switchover capability, the work OLT must be able to communicate the
   registered ONUs associated with an ROID to the protection OLT.

   The PON ONU Database Synchronization would begin once the ICCP PON
   Application enters OPERATIONAL state. The working OLT, the one with
   the working link member for the ROID, would begin transmitting the
   database of actively registered ONUs to the protection OLT for the
   same ROID. Each instance of the PON ONU Database Sync TLV describes
   a set of ONU Database Entries. Each ONU Database Entry would
   describe a registered ONU.

   The transmission of PON ONU Database Descriptors for a given ROID is
   only unidirectional - from the working OLT to the protection OLT.
   The protection OLT would only be responsible for acknowledging the
   received message to provide a reliable database synchronization
   mechanism. As ONUs register and deregister from the working OLT, the
   working OLT would transmit PON ONU Database Synchronization TLV
   including only the updated ONU Database Entries.

   If protected ONUs and unprotected ONUs are miscellaneously attached
   to the same splitter, only the protected ONUs needs to be
   synchronized. The specific ONUs which needs to be synchronized can
   be policy driven and provisioned in the management plane, or by some
   other signaling options.


6. Multi-chassis PON application procedures

   Two typical MPLS protection network architectures for PON access are
   depicted in Fig.2 and Fig.3 (their PON access segments are the same
   as in Fig.1 and thus omitted for simplification). OLTs with MPLS
   functionality are connected to a single PE (Fig.2) or dual home PEs
   (Fig.3) respectively, i.e., the working OLT to PE1 by a working PW
   and the protection OLT to PE1 or PE2 by a protection PW, thus these
   devices constitute an MPLS network which provides PW transport
   services between ONUs and a CE, and the PWs can provide protection
   for each other.

   Faults may be encountered in PON access links, or in the MPLS
   network (including the working OLT). Procedures for these cases are
   described in this section (it is assumed that both OLTs and PEs are
   working in independent mode of PW redundancy [RFC6870]).

6.1. Protection procedure upon PON link failures

   When a fault is detected on a working PON link, a working OLT
   switches to the corresponding protection PON link attached with its
   protection OLT, i.e., the working OLT turns off its faulty PON
   interface so that the protection trunk link to its protection OLT
   can be activated. The working OLT then MUST send an LDP fault
   notification message (i.e., with the status bit "Local AC (ingress)
   Receive Fault" being set) to its peer PE on the remote end of the PW.
   At the same time, the working OLT MUST send an ICCP message with PON
   State TLV with local PON Port State being set to notify the
   protection OLT of the PON fault.

   Upon receiving a PON state TLV where Local PON Port state is set, a
   protection OLT MUST activate the protection PON link in the
   protection group, and advertise a notification message for the
   protection PW with the Preferential Forwarding status bit of active
   to the remote PE.

   According to [RFC6870], the remote PE(s) can match the local and
   remote Preferential Forwarding status and select PW2 as the new
   active PW over which data traffic is sent.



6.2. Protection procedure upon PW failures

   Usually MPLS networks have its own protection mechanism such as LSP
   protection or Fast Reroute (FRR). But in a link sparse access or
   aggregation network where protection for a PW is impossible in its
   LSP layer, the following PW layer protection procedures can be
   enabled.

   When a fault is detected on its working PW (e.g., by VCCV BFD), a
   working OLT SHOULD turn off its associated PON interface and then
   send an ICCP message with PON State TLV with local PON Port State
   being set to notify the protection OLT of the PON fault.

   Upon receiving a PON state TLV where Local PON Port state is set,
   the protection OLT MUST activate its PON interface to the protection
   trunk fiber. At the same time, the protection OLT MUST send a
   notification message for the protection PW with the Preferential
   Forwarding status bit of active to the remote PE, so that traffic
   can be switched to the protection PW.

Internet-Draft            MC-PON Protection                July 2015


6.3. Protection procedure upon the working OLT failure

   As depicted in Fig. 2, a service is provisioned with a working PW
   and a protection PW, both PW terminated on PE1. If PE1 lost its
   connection to the working OLT, it SHOULD send a LDP notification
   message on the protection PW with the Request Switchover bit set.

   Upon receiving a LDP notification message from its remote PE with
   the Request Switchover bit set, a protection OLT MUST activate its
   optical interface to the protection trunk fiber and activate the
   associated protection PW, so that traffic can be reliably switched
   to the protection trunk PON link and the protection PW.

   In the case of Fig.3, PW-RED State TLV [ICCP] can be used by PE1 to
   notify PE2 the faults in all the scenarios, and PE2 operates the
   same as described in Section 5.1 to 5.3.



7. Security Considerations

   Security considerations as described in [ICCP] apply.
