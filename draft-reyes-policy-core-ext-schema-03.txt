1. Introduction

   This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the
   Policy Core LDAP Schema [PCLS] based on the specifications of the
   Policy Core Information Model Extensions [PCIM_EXT]. The changes
   include additional object classes previously not covered, deprecation
   of some object classes and changes to the object class hierarchy
   defined in PCLS.

   Within the context of this document, the term 'PCELS' (Policy Core
   Extension LDAP Schema) is used to refer to the LDAP object class
   definitions contained in this document.


2. Relationship to other Policy Framework Documents

  This document contains an LDAP schema mapping for the classes
  defined in the Policy Core Information Model Extensions [PCIM_EXT].
  Other documents may subsequently be produced, with mappings of the
  same PCIM extensions to other storage or transport technologies.
  The document is an extension to [PCLS], which defines the mapping
  of the Policy Core Information Model [PCIM] to an LDAP schema.


3. Inheritance Hierarchy for PCELS

   The following diagram illustrates the combined class hierarchy for
   the LDAP object classes defined in [PCLS] and in this document:

4. General Discussion of Mapping the Policy Core Information Model
   Extensions to LDAP

   The object classes described in this document contain certain
   optimizations for a directory that uses LDAP as an access protocol.
   One example is the use of auxiliary class attachment to LDAP entries
   to realize some of the associations defined in the information model.

   Note that other storage types might need to implement the association
   differently.



4.1 Summary of Class and Association Mappings

   The LDAP object classes defined in this document are a direct mapping
   from the corresponding classes and, in some cases, the associations
   defined in [PCIM_EXT]. Similarly, the LDAP attributes defined here
   are a direct mapping from the corresponding class properties. In some
   cases, associations defined in [PCIM_EXT] are simply mapped to
   reference attributes or realized through auxiliary class attachment.

   The classes pcimVendorVariableAuxClass and pcimVendorValueAuxClass
   are not mapped from [PCIM_EXT], they are new classes added in order
   to increase the framework's capability to store variables and values
   that have not been modeled with specific properties. Just like for
   any other schema elements defined in this document or in [PCLS], a
   particular submodel schema will not, in general, need to use vendor
   specific variable and value classes. Submodel schemas should apply
   the recommendations of section 5.10 of [PCIM_EXT] with regards to
   the supported and unsupported elements.

   Similar to [PCLS], the prefix "pcim" is used for all the object class
   and attribute names defined in this document.

4.2 Summary of changes since PCLS

   This section provides an overview of the changes to PCLS defined in
   this document:

   1. Changes to the pcimRepository: Because of the potential for
   confusion with the Policy Framework component Policy Repository as
   described in section 3.2.1 in [PCIM_EXT], the class is now called
   pcimReusableContainer. Its subclasses have been renamed as well.

   2. The pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass and pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass
   auxiliary classes used to map the PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup and
   PolicyGroupInPolicyGroup aggregations defined by [PCIM] are replaced
   by the structural class pcimPolicySetAssociation and the attribute
   pcimPolicySetList added to the abstract class pcimPolicySet. The
   section 4.4 presents the details related to this association.

   3. The class pcimRule is deprecated and with it the absolute
   prioritization of policy rules is no longer available. A relative
   prioritization of policies is introduced through the attribute
   pcimPriority in the pcimPolicySet object class. This attribute
   indicates the relative priority of the components of a policy set or,
   for a PolicySetInSystem, the priority of the referenced policy set
   relative to the other policy sets associated to this system.


   4. A new attribute pcimDecisionStrategy is added on the pcimPolicySet
   class in order to map the decision mechanism described in [PCIM_EXT].

INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                        August 2003


   5. The attribute pcimRoles is moved to the class pcimPolicySet from
   the deprecated class pcimRule. Thus, the role based policy selection
   mechanism is preserved and extended to all the subclasses of
   pcimPolicySet.

   6. The new attribute pcimExecutionStrategy is added to the
   pcimPolicyRule class to allow the specification of the expected
   behavior in the case where there are multiple actions aggregated by
   a rule or by a compound action.

   7. Compound Conditions: The pcimCompoundConditionAuxClass class is
   added in order to map the CompoundPolicyCondition [PCIM_EXT]'s class.
   A new class, pcimConditionAssociation, is introduced to realize the
   aggregation of policy conditions in a pcimCompoundConditionAuxClass.
   The same class is used to aggregate policy conditions in a
   pcimPolicyRule while the pcimRuleConditionAssociation defined in
   [PCLS] for this purpose, is deprecated.

   8. Compound Actions: The pcimCompoundActionAuxClass class is
   added in order to map the CompoundPolicyAction [PCIM_EXT]'s class.
   A new class, pcimActionAssociation, is introduced to realize the
   aggregation of policy actions in a pcimCompoundActionAuxClass.
   The same class is used to aggregate policy actions in a
   pcimPolicyRule while the pcimRuleActionAssociation defined in [PCLS]
   for this purpose, is deprecated.

   9. Variables and values: The classes defined in [PCIM_EXT] for the
   implementation of simple conditions and actions directly mapped to
   auxiliary classes. These classes are: pcimSimpleConditionAuxClass,
   pcimSimpleActionAuxClass, pcimVariable and its subclasses, and
   pcimValue and its subclasses.

   10. Reusable conditions, actions, groups, rules, variables and values
   are subordinated (DIT contained) to a pcimReusableContainer entry.
   Thus, the ReusablePolicy association defined in [PCIM_EXT] is
   Realized through subordination.

   11. Device level filter classes are added to the schema.

   12. The pcimRoleCollection class is added to the schema to allow
   the association of policy roles to resources represented as LDAP
   entries.

   13. A general extension mechanism is introduced for representing
   policy variables and values that have not been specifically modeled.
   The mechanism is intended for vendor-specific extensions.

4.3 The Association of PolicyVariable and PolicyValues
    to PolicySimpleCondition and PolicySimpleAction

   A PolicySimpleCondition as well as a PolicySimpleAction includes a
   single PolicyValue and a single PolicyVariable. Each of them can be
   attached or referenced by a DN.

   The attachment helps create compact PolicyCondition and PolicyAction
   definitions that can be efficiently provisioned and retrieved from
   the repository. On the other hand, referenced PolicyVariables and
   PolicyValues instances can be reused in the construction of multiple
   policies and permit the administrative partitioning of the data and
   policy definitions.


4.4 The Aggregation of PolicyRules and PolicyGroups in PolicySets

   In [PCIM_EXT], the two aggregations PolicyGroupInPolicyGroup and
   PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup, are combined into a single aggregation
   PolicySetComponent. This aggregation and the capability of
   association between a policy and the ReusablePolicyContainer offer
   new possibilities of reusability. Furthermore, these aggregations
   introduce new semantics representing the execution of one PolicyRule
   withing the scope of another PolicyRule.

   Since PolicySet is defined in [PCIM_EXT], it is mapped in this
   document to a new class pcimPolicySet in order to provide an
   abstraction for a set of policy rules or groups. The aggregation
   class PolicySetComponent in [PCIM_EXT] is mapped to a multi-value
   attribute pcimPolicySetList in the pcimPolicySet class and the
   attribute pcimPolicySetDN in the pcimPolicySetAssociation. These
   attributes refer to the nested rules and groups.

   It is possible to store a rule/group nested in an other rule/group
   in two ways. The first way is to define the nested rule/group as
   specific to the nesting rule/group. The second way is to define the
   nested rules/groups as reusable.

   association between the set (rule or group) and its nested rules/
   groups. The nested pcimPolicySet instances are attached (as auxiliary
   classes) to the association entries.

   Set#: pcimPolicyRuleAuxClass or pcimGroupAuxClass class.
   SA#: PolicySetAssocation structural class.
   S#: structural class.


   The nesting pcimPolicySet refers to instances of
   pcimPolicySetAssociation using the attribute pcimPolicySetList.
   These structural association classes are subordinated (DIT contained)
   to the pcimPolicySet entry and represent the association between
   the set (rule or group) and its nested rules/groups. The reusable
   rules/groups are instantiated here as auxiliary classes and attached
   to pcimPolicyInstance entries in the reusable container. An other
   option is to use the structural subclasses for defining reusable
   rules/groups. The association classes belonging to a nesting policy
   set are reference the reusable rules/groups using the attribute
   pcimPolicySetDN.

   A combination of both specific and reusable components is also
   allowed for the same policy set.

4.5 The Aggregation of actions/conditions in PolicyRules and
     CompoundActions/CompoundConditions

   [PCIM_EXT] defines two new classes that offer the designer the
   capability of creating more complex conditions and actions.
   CompoundPolicyCondition and CompoundPolicyActionclasses are mapped
   in this document to pcimCompoundConditionAuxClass and
   pcimCompoundActionAuxClass classes that are subclasses of
   pcimConditionAuxClass/pcimActionAuxClass. The compound
   conditions/actions defined in [PCIM_EXT] extend the capability of the
   rule to associate, group and evaluate/execute conditions/actions. The
   conditions/actions are associated to compounds conditions/actions in
   the same way as they are associated to the rules.

   In this section it is explained how to store instances of these
   classes in an LDAP Directory. As a general rule, specific
   conditions/actions are subordinated (DIT contained) to the rule or
   compound condition/action that aggregates them and are attached
   to association class instances. Reusable conditions/actions, are
   subordinated to pcimReusableContainer instances and attached to
   pcimPolicyInstance instances.

   The examples below illustrate the four possible cases combining
   specific/reusable compound/non-compound condition/action. The rule
   has two compound conditions, each one has two different conditions.
   The schemes can be extended in order to store actions.

   The examples below are based on and extend those illustrated in
   the section 4.4 of [PCLS].

   Because the compound conditions/actions are specific to the Rule,
   They are auxiliary attachments to instances of the structural
   classes pcimConditionAssociation or pcimActionAssociation. These
   structural classes represent the association between the rule and
   the compound condition/action . The rule specific conditions/actions
   are therefore subordinated (DIT contained) to the rule entry.

   The conditions/actions are tied to the compound conditions/actions
   in the same way the compound conditions/actions are tied to rules.
   Association classes realize the association between the aggregating
   compound conditions/actions and the specific conditions/actions.

   This case is similar to the first one. The conditions/actions are
   reusable so they are not attached to the association classes but they
   are attached to structural classes in the reusable container. The
   association classes tie the conditions/actions in located in a
   reusable container to their aggregators using DN references.

   All the conditions/actions are reusable so they are stored in
   reusable containers. The figure above illustrates two different
   reusable policy containers but the number of containers in the
   system is decided based on administrative reasons. The conditions,
   actions, etc. may be stored in the same container or in different
   containers with no impact on the policy definition semantics.


5. Class Definitions

5.1 The Class pcimPolicySet

   The abstract class PolicySet in the [PCIM_EXT] is introduced to
   provide an abstraction for a set of rules. The class value
   'pcimPolicySet' is used as the mechanism for identifying group and
   rule- related instances in the DIT.

   In [PCIM_EXT], the classes PolicyGroup and PolicyRule are moved, so
   that they are now derived from PolicySet class.

   A pcimPolicySet object refers to instances of pcimGroup and
   pcimPolicyRule via the attribute pcimPolicySetList and the attribute
   pcimPolicySetDN in the pcimPolicySetAssociation object class.

   The definition of the abstract class pcimPolicySet:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
     NAME 'pcimPolicySet'
     DESC 'Abstract class that represents a collection of policies
           that form a coherent set.'
     SUP pcimPolicy
     ABSTRACT
     MAY ( pcimPolicySetName
         $ pcimDecisionStrategy
         $ pcimRoles
         $ pcimPolicySetList )
   )

   One of the attributes of the pcimPolicySet class, the pcimRoles is
   already defined in [PCLS]. The other three attributes are defined
   below.













Reyes, et al.              Expires: February 2004              [page 21]
INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                        August 2003


   The attribute pcimPolicySetName may be used as naming attribute for
   pcimPolicySet entries:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
     NAME 'pcimPolicySetName'
     DESC 'The user-friendly name of a policy set.'
     EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
     ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch
     SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The attribute pcimDecisionStrategy is used to define the evaluation
   method among the rules in the policy set and is mapped directly from
   the PolicyDecisionStrategy property defined in [PCIM_EXT].

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
     NAME 'pcimDecisionStrategy'
     DESC 'The evaluation method used for the components of a
           in the pcimPolicySet. Valid values: 1 [FirstMatching],
           2 [AllMatching]'
     EQUALITY integerMatch
     ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The attibute pcimPolicySetList is used to realize the
   PolicySetComponent aggregation.

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
     NAME 'pcimPolicySetList'
     DESC 'List of DN references to pcimPolicySetAssociation
           entries used to aggregate policy sets.'
     EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
   )

   The subclasses pcimGroup and pcimPolicyRule are now derived from
   pcimPolicySet.

5.2 The Structural Class pcimPolicySetAssociation

   The pcimPolicySetAssociation class is used to aggregate components
   into pcimPolicySet entries. Instances of this class are always
   subordinated to the aggregating pcimPolicySet. The aggregation of a
   reusable instance of (subclass of) pcimPolicySet is referenced via
   the pcimPolicySetDN attribute. A non-reusable instance of (subclass
   of) pcimPolicySet is attached as auxiliary class directly to the
   pcimPolicySetAssociation entry.

   If a pcimPolicySetAssociation instance has a pcimPolicySet attached
   to it then the attribute pcimPolicySetDN SHOULD NOT be present in the
   same entry. However, if such situation occurs this attribute MUST be
   ignored.

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
     NAME 'pcimPolicySetAssociation'
     DESC 'Structural class that contains attributes characterizing
           the relationship between a policy set and one of its
           components.'
     SUP pcimPolicy
     STRUCTURAL
     MUST ( pcimPriority )
     MAY ( pcimPolicySetName
         $ pcimPolicySetDN )
   )

   The Attribute pcimPriority:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
     NAME 'pcimPriority'
     DESC 'Policy priority.'
     EQUALITY integerMatch
     ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The Attribute pcimPolicySetDN:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
     NAME 'pcimPolicySetDN'
     DESC 'DN reference to a pcimPolicySet entry.'
     EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12

5.3 The Updated Class pcimGroup

   The pcimGroup is defined in [PCLS]. Its superclass is changed here
   so that the pcimGroup can take advantage of the pcimPolicySet and
   its aggregation method.

   (  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.2
      NAME 'pcimGroup'
      DESC   'A container for a set of related pcimPolicyRule entries
              and/or a set of related pcimGroup entries.'
      SUP     pcimPolicySet
      ABSTRACT
      MAY    (pcimGroupName)
   )


5.4 The Deprecated Class pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass

   The policy group aggregation is replaced by the more comprehensive
   policy set aggregation. Therefore this class is deprecated.

   The attribute pcimGroupsAuxContainedSet only used in the definition
   of the deprecated pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass object class is also
   deprecated.


5.5 The Deprecated Class pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass

   The policy rule aggregation is replaced by the more comprehensive
   policy set aggregation. Therefore this class is deprecated.

   The attribute pcimRulesAuxContainedSet only used in the definition
   of the deprecated pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass object class is also
   deprecated.


5.6 The Three Classes pcimPolicyRule

   The base class representing policy rules is redefined without a
   priority attribute. In addition, this class uses the Condition and
   Action aggregation methods similar to the CompoundCondition and the
   CompoundAction.

   If a pcimPolicyRule instance has a pcimConditionAuxClass attached to
   it then the attribute pcimConditionList SHOULD NOT be present in the
   same entry for the purpose of associating other conditions to the
   rule. However, when such situation occurs the referenced conditions
   MUST NOT be considered as associated to the rule.

   If a pcimPolicyRule instance has a pcimActionAuxClass attached to it
   then the attribute pcimActionList should not be present in the same
   entry for the purpose of associating other actions to the rule.
   However, when such situation occurs the referenced actions must not
   be considered as associated to the rule.

5.7 The Structural Class pcimConditionAssociation

   This class is used to aggregate policy conditions in compound policy
   conditions or policy rules. It implements the
   PolicyConditionInPolicyRule and PolicyConditionInPolicyCondition
   aggregations. The pcimConditionAssociation class is used to aggregate
   policy conditions into pcimPolicyRule or
   pcimCompoundConditionAuxClass entries. Instances of this class are
   always subordinated to the aggregating pcimPolicyRule or
   pcimCompoundConditionAuxClass. The aggregation of a reusable instance
   of (subclass of) pcimConditionAuxClass is referenced via the
   pcimConditionDN attribute. A non-reusable instance of (subclass of)
   pcimConditionAuxClass is attached directly to the
   pcimConditionAssociation entry.

   If a pcimConditionAssociation instance has a pcimConditionAuxClass
   attached to it then the attribute pcimConditionDN SHOULD NOT be
   present in the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this
   attribute MUST be ignored.

5.8 The Structural Class pcimActionAssociation

   This class is used to aggregate policy actions in compound policy
   actions or policy rules. It implements the PolicyActionInPolicyRule
   and PolicyActionInPolicyAction aggregations. The
   pcimActionAssociation class is used to aggregate policy actions into
   pcimPolicyRule or pcimCompoundActionAuxClass entries. Instances of
   this class are always subordinated to the aggregating pcimPolicyRule
   or pcimCompoundActionAuxClass. The aggregation of a reusable instance
   of (subclass of) pcimActionAuxClass is referenced via the
   pcimActionDN attribute. A non-reusable instance of (subclass of)
   pcimActionAuxClass is attached directly to the pcimActionAssociation
   entry.

   If a pcimActionAssociation instance has a pcimActionAuxClass attached
   to it then the attribute pcimActionDN SHOULD NOT be present in the
   same entry. However, if such situation occurs this attribute MUST be
   ignored.

   The class definition follows:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
     NAME 'pcimActionAssociation'
     DESC 'This class contains attributes characterizing the
           relationship between a policy action and one of its

5.9 The Three Deprecated Classes pcimRule

   The class pcimRule and its subclasses are replaced by pcimPolicyRule
   and its subclasses. Therefore pcimRule and its subclasses are
   deprecated.

   The following attributes only used in the definition of the
   deprecated pcimRule object class are also deprecated:

5.10 The Deprecated Class pcimRuleConditionAssociation.

   This class is replaced by the more flexible pcimConditionAssociation.


5.11 The Deprecated Class pcimRuleActionAssociation.

   This class is replaced by the more flexible pcimActionAssociation.


5.12 The Auxiliary Class pcimSimpleConditionAuxClass.

   This class indicates if a specific <variable> match with a specific
   <value>. The "match" relationship is to be interpreted by analyzing
   the variable and value instances associated with the simple
   condition. Its two attributes realize the
   PolicyValueinSimplePolicyCondition and
   PolicyVariableinSimplePolicyCondition associations defined in
   [PCIM_EXT].

   A reusable variable / value is associated to a
   pcimSimpleConditionAuxClass via the pcimVariableDN / pcimValueDN
   reference from the simple condition entry. A non-reusable variable
   / value is associated directly as auxiliary object class to the
   pcimSimpleConditionAuxClass entry.

   If a pcimSimpleConditionAuxClass instance has a pcimVariable
   attached to it then the attribute pcimVariableDN SHOULD NOT be
   present in the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this
   attribute MUST be ignored.
   If a pcimSimpleConditionAuxClass instance has a pcimValueAuxClass
   attached to it then the attribute pcimValueDN SHOULD NOT be
   present in the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this
   attribute MUST be ignored.

   The class definition follows:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x

   )

   A instance of pcimSimpleActionAuxClass and an instance of
   pcimSimpleConditionAuxClass MUST NOT be attached to a same
   entry. Because the two classes use the same mechanisms to
   associate Variables and Values, this restriction is necessary
   in order to avoid ambiguities.


5.13 The Auxiliary Class pcimCompoundConditionAuxClass.

   This class represents a compound policy condition, formed by
   aggregation of other policy conditions. A boolean attribute indicates
   whether the compounded conditions are to be interpreted as
   disjunctive normal form or conjunctive normal form.

   The class definition follows:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
     NAME 'pcimCompoundConditionAuxClass'
     DESC 'An auxiliary class that represents a boolean combination
           of simpler conditions'.

   The attribute pcimConditionListType is used to specify whether the
   list of policy conditions associated with this compound policy
   condition is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) or conjunctive normal
   form (CNF). The attribute pcimConditionList is an unordered set of
   DN references to conditions aggregated in the compound condition.
   These attributes are defined in section 5.6.


5.14 The Auxiliary Class pcimCompoundFilterAuxClass.

   This class represents a domain-level filter and it typically contains
   a set of simple conditions.

5.15 The Auxiliary Class pcimSimpleActionAuxClass.

   This class overwrites an old value of the <variable> and set the new
   <value>. Its two attributes realize the
   PolicyValueInSimplePolicyAction and
   PolciyVariableInSimplePolicyAction associations defined in
   [PCIM_EXT].

   A reusable variable / value is associated to a
   pcimSimpleActionAuxClass via the pcimVariableDN / pcimValueDN
   reference from the simple action entry. A non-reusable variable
   / value is associated directly as auxiliary object class to the
   pcimSimpleActionAuxClass entry.

5.17 The Abstract Class pcimVariable.

   Variables specify the property of a flow or an event that should be
   matched when evaluating the condition. A given variable selects the
   set of matchable values through the
   ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association.
   A pcimVariable entry may be associated to a set of pcimValueAuxClass
   entries that represent its expected values. The expected values for
   a variable may be indicated by:
      (1) pcimExpectedValueList references to reusable instances of
          pcimValueAuxClass or by
      (2) pcimExpectedValueList references to subordinated non-reusable

5.23 The Three Classes pcimReusableContainer

   This class represents a container of reusable policy elements.
   The elements of a reusable container are aggregated via DIT
   containment. A reusable policy container can include the elements
   of other reusable policy containers by aggregating the container
   itself. This is realized by referencing the aggregated container
   by means of the attribute pcimReusableContainerList.

   The attribute pcimIPHdrVersion identifies the IP version and dictates
   the format for the IP version dependent attribute values in a
   pcimIPHeaders entry. These attributes are:
      pcimIPHdrSourceAddress
      pcimIPHdrSourceAddressEndOfRange
      pcimIPHdrSourceMask
      pcimIPHdrDestAddress
      pcimIPHdrDestAddressEndOfRange
      pcimIPHdrDestMask

   If a value for this attribute is not provided, then the filter does
   not consider IP version in selecting matching packets. In this case,
   IP version dependent attributes must not be present in the filter
   entry. The possible values of pcimIPHdrVersion are '4' and '6'.

5.29 The Auxiliary Class pcimFilterListAuxClass.

   This class represents a set of device-level filters aggregated
   in a policy condition. Therefore, instances of this class can be
   used in policy rules or as elements of more complex compound
   conditions. The aggregation EntriesInFilterList from the
   [PCIM_EXT] model is implemented by the multi-value attribute
   pcimFilterEntryList. The EntrySequence property of the aggregation
   EntriesInFilterList that is restricted to its default value ('0')
   in the [PCIM_EXT] model is redundant and therefore not implemented.

   The attribute pcimFilterDirection indicates the direction
   of the packets or messages relative to the interface where
   the filter is applied. The possible values are:
   NotApplicable(0), Input(1), Output(2), Both(3), Mirrored(4).

5.30 The Auxiliary Class pcimVendorVariableAuxClass.

   This class provides a general extension mechanism for representing
   policy variables that have not been modeled with specific properties.
   Instead, its two properties are used to define the content and format
   of the variable, as explained below. This class is intended for
   vendor-specific extensions that are not amenable to using
   pcimVariable; standardized extensions SHOULD NOT use this class.

   The class definition is as follows:

   The pcimVendorVariableData attribute is a multi-valued attribute. It
   provides a general mechanism for representing policy variables that
   have not been modeled as specific attributes. This information is
   encoded in a set of octet strings. The format of the octet strings is
   identified by the OID stored in the pcimVendorVariableEncoding
   attribute. This attribute is defined as follows:

6. Security Considerations

   This topic is based on requirements from previous [PCLS] documents
   and also takes into account other RFCs about the same security
   aspects entitled as following:

   RFC 2829 (Authentication Methods for LDAP)
   RFC 2830 (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3): Extension for
             Transport Layer Security)

   These RFC documents provide a general framework for security
   architecture of the system. However some comments have to be provided
   as a consequence of the inclusion of extensions in this own document
   and its relation with PCLS doc.








Reyes, et al.              Expires: February 2004              [page 54]
INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                        August 2003


   Due to the new considered scenarios, with reusability and information
   containers located in other DITs etc, these conditions are expressed
   in chapter 4.4 of the [PCLS] document. As a consequence, new types of
   threats in the system have to be considered. In fact, it is necessary
   to define new security services in order to protect against these new
   aspects. As a result of this, the following new security services are
   defined:

   1) Authentication between entities of the network
   2) Mutual authentication between network operator and network
      entities (p.e. DITs)
   3) Integrity and confidentiality of links between network entities
      and also in the LDAP directories.

   Several definitions and security mechanisms related about DITs can
   also obtained from the following ITU specification: X.509 The
   Directory Authentication framework

   Furthermore, the obtention of the OIDs and values of the attributes
   From the DITs in a distributed scenario has as a consequence the
   Interaction between diverse network entities with changes of security
   Domain and/or administrative domain.

   In this directory scenario, with migration of data, the use of DSP
   (Directory Service Protocol) protocol with types of queries like
   referral, chaining and multicasting with different key management and
   authentication among network entities would have to be considered.
