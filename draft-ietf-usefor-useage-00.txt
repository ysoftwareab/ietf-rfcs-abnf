                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Basic Concepts

   "Netnews" is a set of protocols for generating, storing and
   retrieving news "articles" (which resemble email messages) and for
   exchanging them amongst a readership which is potentially widely
   distributed. It is organized around "newsgroups", with the
   expectation that each reader will be able to see all articles posted
   to each newsgroup in which he participates. These protocols are
   defined in [USEFOR].

   "Usenet" is a particular worldwide open network based upon the
   Netnews protocols, with the newsgroups being organized into
   recognized "hierarchies".  Anybody can join (it is simply necessary
   to negotiate an exchange of articles with one or more other
   participating hosts).

   Usenet "belongs" to those who administer the hosts of which it is
   comprised. There is no Cabal with overall authority to direct what is
   to be be allowed. Nevertheless, there do exist agencies within Usenet
   that have authority to establish policies and to perform
   administrative functions, but such authority derives solely from the
   consent of those sites which choose to recognize it (and who can
   decline to exchange articles with sites which choose not to recognize
   it). Usually, the authority of such an agency is restricted to a
   particular hierarchy, or group of hierarchies.

   A "policy" is a rule intended to facilitate the smooth operation of a
   network by establishing parameters which restrict behaviour that,
   whilst technically unexceptionable, would nevertheless contravene
   some accepted standard of "Good Netkeeping". Since the ultimate
   beneficiaries of a network are its human readers, who will be less
   tolerant of poorly designed interfaces than mere computers, articles
   in breach of established policy can cause considerable annoyance to
   their recipients.

1.2.  Objectives

   The purpose of this document is to set out how software should behave
   and conventions which users should observe, in order that Netnews in
   general, and Usenet in particular, should provide the most effective
   service to its users.

   [USEFOR] is a standard, and hence its requirements are mandatory. The
   requirements set out here are in addition to the requirements set out
   in [USEFOR].  Their purpose is to establish "Best Current Practice",
   and hence they are advisory. Nevertheless, failure to observe them
   will severely prejudice the good order of Usenet, and cause great
   inconvenience to the users of that medium.

        NOTE: The extreme irritation caused to other readers by such
        violations is not to be underestimated; however, enforcement of
        such rules is more a matter of sensible design or of social

C. H. Lindsey                                                   [Page 4]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

        pressure (whose effectiveness should not be underestimated, even
        though it cannot be prescribed).

   Many of these requirements are matters of policy which may vary from
   network to network, from hierarchy to hierarchy within one network,
   and even between individual newsgroups within one hierarchy. It is
   assumed, for the purposes of this document, that agencies with
   varying degrees of authority to establish such policies will exist,
   and that where they do not, policy will be established by mutual
   agreement. However, it is NOT the purpose of this document to define
   how the authority of various agencies to exercise control or
   oversight of the various parts of Usenet is established (that is
   itself a matter of policy).  For the benefit of networks and
   hierarchies without such established agencies, and to provide a basis
   upon which all agencies can build, this present document often
   provides default policy parameters, usually introducing them by a
   phrase such as "As a matter of policy ...".

        NOTE: The practices recommended here relate only to Netnews and
        Usenet, and not to any other medium. Nevertheless, it may be
        that some of them may turn out to be helpful for other media
        such as mailing lists.

2.  Definitions, Notations and Conventions

2.1.  Definitions

   All the technical terms defined in [USEFOR] section 2.1 are
   considered to be defined in this document also.

2.2.  Textual Notations

   This document contains explanatory NOTEs using the following format.
   These may be skipped by persons interested solely in the content of
   the specification. The purpose of the notes is to explain why choices
   were made, to place them in context, or to suggest possible
   implementation techniques.

        NOTE: While such explanatory notes may seem superfluous in
        principle, they often help the less-than-omniscient reader
        understand the true intent of the specification in cases where
        the wording is not entirely clear.

   Certain words, when capitalized, are used to define the significance
   of individual requirements. The key words "MUST", "REQUIRED",
   "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL", and any of those words
   associated with the word "NOT", are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC 2119].

   However, as provided in that RFC, the force of these words is lower
   here than would have been the case in a standards track document. In
   particular, violation of a MUST or SHOULD does not necessarily imply
   a failure of interoperability, but rather that established policy or
   accepted best practice would be breached, to the detriment of the

C. H. Lindsey                                                   [Page 5]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   good order of Usenet.

        NOTE: A requirement imposed on a relaying or serving agent
        regarding some particular article should be understood as
        applying only if that article is actually accepted for
        processing (since any agent may always reject any article
        entirely, for reasons of site policy).
[That NOTE can probably be removed, or severely rewritten, once we have
a better idea of the requirements/recommendations we are going to make
in this document.]

   Wherever the context permits, use of the masculine includes the
   feminine and use of the singular includes the plural, and vice versa.

   Throughout this document we will give various examples.  In order to
   prevent possible conflict with "Real World" entities and people the
   top level domain ".example" is used in all sample domains and
   addresses. The hierarchy "example.*" is also used as a sample
   hierarchy.  Information on the ".example" top level domain is in [RFC
   2606].

3.  The Well-Behaved User Agent

   The term "user agent" comprises posting agents, reading agents and
   followup agents as defined in [USEFOR], and also reply agents, by
   which is meant a user agent that is generating an email, presumably
   addressed to the poster of an article. Although it is usual for all
   these functionalities to be included within a single piece of
   software, it is convenient to discuss them separately here.

   This section is addressed primarily to the implementors of user
   agents. Whilst it is common for such agents to combine the functions
   of a Netnews User Agent (NUA) and a Mail User Agent (MUA), it needs
   to be realized that they serve different functions, and adding a few
   extra features to an MUA is unlikely to result in a good NUA, any
   more than adding a few extra features to an NUA would result in a
   good MUA.

3.1.  The Well-Behaved Posting Agent

   The implementor of a posting agent SHOULD make it possible for a
   suitably perseverent poster to generate any article, however absurd,
   that conforms strictly to [USEFOR].  On the other hand, it needs to
   be understood that the difference between a good posting agent and a
   bad posting agent lies in its ability to encourage the poster to
   adhere to good standards of "netkeeping", by making it easy to
   generate articles that will be widely acceptable to the conventions
   and expectations of the Usenet community, and hard to generate
   articles outside of those norms. This is largely a matter of choosing
   appropriate defaults for various parameters and settings.

   Here it shold be noted that what is acceptable in Email (which is a
   one-to-few communication where the author can be expected to be aware
   of the capabilities and preferences of his correspondents) may not be

C. H. Lindsey                                                   [Page 6]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   acceptable in Netnews (which is a one-to-many communication directed
   at an unseen and unknown audience).  Much grief has arisen in the
   past from poorly designed agents which tried to imppose onto Usenet
   defaults and practices which were perfectly appropriate for Email.

3.1.1.  Construction of Headers

   Whilst it SHOULD be possible to insert any legitimate header, not
   limited to those defined in [USEFOR] and including experimental
   headers, there are certain essential headers, namely the Subject-,
   Newsgroups-, Followup-To- and Reply-To-headers which the poster MUST
   be able to insert and/or edit (and to do so at any stage during the
   composition of the article). Note that this specifically includes the
   possibility of setting the followup to "poster".

   Posting agents SHOULD permit the poster to include headers of
   arbitrary length (and MUST permit at least 79 characters).  However,
   they SHOULD endeavour to keep individual header lines, so far as is
   possible, within 79 characters (or other established policy limit) by
   folding them at suitable places (however, the limit of 998 octets
   ([USEFOR] 4.5) on any individual header line still applies); but if
   the poster has manually folded a header within the accepted limits
   (to achieve some pleasing layout, for example) the posting agent
   SHOULD respect the poster's intent.

   Although header-contents are defined in such a way that folding
   ([USEFOR] 4.2.3) can take place between many of the lexical tokens
   (and even within some of them), folding SHOULD be limited to placing
   the CRLF at higher-level syntactic breaks, and SHOULD also avoid
   leaving trailing WSP on the preceding line. For instance, if a
   header-content is defined as comma-separated values, it is
   RECOMMENDED that folding occur after the comma separating the values,
   even if it is allowed elsewhere.

   There is a preferred case convention, which posters and posting
   agents SHOULD use: each hyphen-separated "word" has its initial
   letter (if any) in uppercase and the rest in lowercase, except that
   some abbreviations have all letters uppercase (e.g. "Message-ID" and
   "MIME-Version"). The forms given in the various rules defining
   headers in [USEFOR] show the preferred forms (but relaying and
   reading agents are expected to tolerate articles not obeying this
   convention).

   A comment ([USEFOR] 4.2.4) is normally used to provide some human
   readable informational text, except at the end of a mailbox which
   contains no phrase, as in
      fred@foo.bar.example (Fred Bloggs)
   as opposed to
      "Fred Bloggs" <fred@foo.bar.example> .

   The former is a deprecated, but commonly encountered, usage for
   indicating the name of the person whose mailbox it is. Posting agents
   SHOULD NOT now be generating it.


C. H. Lindsey                                                   [Page 7]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   Headers that merely state defaults explicitly (e.g., a Followup-To-
   header with the same content as the Newsgroups-header, or a MIME
   Content-Type-header with contents "text/plain; charset=us-ascii"), or
   state information that reading agents can typically determine easily
   themselves (e.g. the length of the body in octets) are redundant and
   posting agents SHOULD NOT include them.

   There follow some recommendations specific to particular headers.

3.1.1.1.  Date

   It is RECOMMENDED to add a comment, after the date-time, containing
   the time zone in human-readable form. However, many of the
   abbreviations commonly used for this purpose are ambiguous, and so
   the value given by the <zone> is the only definitive form. For
   example:

      Date: Sat, 26 May 2001 11:13:00 -0500 (EST)

3.1.1.2.  From

   The mailboxes in the From-content MUST contain syntactically valid
   email addresses identifying the poster(s).  Each such mailbox SHOULD
   be a working email address, belonging to the poster(s) of the
   article, or the person or agent on whose behalf the article is
   posted. When, for whatever reason, a poster does not wish ro use a
   working address, the mailbox concerned SHOULD, to comply with
   [USEFOR], end in the top level domain ".invalid" [RFC 2606].

        NOTE: It is fashionable for posters to disguise their mail
        addresses to discourage malicious harvesting and for other
        purposes. Whilst the circumstances which might make this seem
        desirable are much to be regretted, the practice cannot be
        regarded as in the best interests of Usenet, and this document
        does not seek to promote the practice, even though it shows how
        to do it "correctly". Therefore, it is NOT recommended that
        implementors should go out of their way to facilitate it.

3.1.1.3.  Message-ID

   Posting agents have the option of generating their own message
   identifiers, or of leaving it to the injecting agent. Recall that it
   is an absolute requirement of [USEFOR] that message identifiers
   should be unique with regard to all other Netnews articles or Email
   messages, past, present or future. However, it would in practice be
   sufficient to ensure that there were astronomical odds against a
   duplicated message identifier, and this is usually brought about by
   using the domain name of the originating site in the id-right of the
   msg-id, together with the time of composition and other
   disambiguating material (such as a process number or a serial number)
   in the id-left. It is also in order to include additional information
   of significance to the poster within the id-left, and even to
   deliberately make a non-unique identifier in cases where the
   identical message is to be posted by several posters (for example, a

C. H. Lindsey                                                   [Page 8]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   cancel for an article which may also be cancelled by others).
[Recall that we have two drafts regarding the construction of message
identifiers on www.landfield.com/usefor that were written in the early
days of Usefor.  Maybe these should be dusted down, published, and
referred to here.]

3.1.1.4.  Subject

   There is a temptation amongst inventors of new protocols to require
   particular phrases to be inserted or regognized automatically at
   particular places within the Subject-header. This temptation is
   strongly to be resisted.

   There are, however, two exceptions to this principle which have
   become hallowed by longstanding usage:

   1. There is an established convention for the Subject-header in a
      followup to begin with "Re: ", and this SHOULD be supported (see
      3.2.1.1).

   2. For compatibility with legacy news software, the Subject-content
      of a control message (i.e. an article that also contains a
      Control-header) MAY start with the string "cmsg ", and non-control
      messages SHOULD NOT start with the string "cmsg ". See also
      section 6.1.
[SHOULD NOT changed from MUST NOT? Do there really still exist servers
or other agents that will recognize and act upon "cmsg" in a Subject-
header? And if so, maybe that MUST NOT should be moved back into
[USEFOR].]

   Subject-headers are for humans to read, and the most that user agents
   should do is to filter them as directed by their human readers. If
   some enhancement to Netnews requires support within the headers, then
   the proper procedure is to invent a new header for the purpose, or to
   adapt an existing header (supposing it had the capability to support
   such adaptations).

3.1.1.5.  Newsgroups

   There are restrictions on the length of components of newsgroup-
   names, and on the newsgroup-names themselves, as described more fully
   in 7.2.  Posting and injecting agents MAY attempt to enforce them
   but, because of the possibility that hierarchy policies or future
   standards may relax them, it SHOULD be possible for posters to
   override such checks, and software MUST be so written that they can
   be disabled altogether.

   Posting agents MAY (and followup agents SHOULD) accept articles
   crossposted to newsgroups which do not exist on their local hosts,
   though posting agents SHOULD at least alert the poster to the
   situation and request confirmation.

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

3.1.1.6.  Reply-To

   In the absence of Reply-To, the reply address(es) is the address(es)
   in the From-header. For this reason a Reply-To SHOULD NOT be included
   if it just duplicates the From-header.

        NOTE: Use of a Reply-To-header is preferable to including a
        similar request in the article body, because replying agents can
        take account of Reply-To automatically.

3.1.1.7.  Organization

   Posting agents are discouraged from providing a default value for
   this header unless it is acceptable to all posters using those agents
   and unless it contains useful information (including some indication
   of the poster's physical environment). See section 4.1.2 for an even
   stronger discouragement for injecting agents.

3.1.1.8.  Distribution

   Posting agents SHOULD NOT provide a default Distribution-header
   without giving the poster an opportunity to override it.

3.1.1.9.  Followup-To

   A Followup-To-header SHOULD NOT be included if it just duplicates the
   Newsgroups-header.  At least one of its newsgroup-names SHOULD exist
   on the posting agent's host (since a well behaved poster ought not to
   be setting followups to a place that he cannot read). Cf. a similar
   rule regarding crossposting in [USEFOR] section 5.5.

3.1.1.10.  User-Agent

   Comments in User-Agent-headers should be restricted to information
   regarding the product named to their left, such as its full name or
   platform information, and should be concise. Use as an advertising
   medium (in the mundane sense) is discouraged.

3.1.2.  Construction of Bodies

   It was the fashion at one time to indicate underlining within body
   texts using Backspace, in the form of an underscore (US-ASCII 95), a
   backspace, and a character, repeated for each character that should
   be underlined. Posting agents MAY support this mechanism, although it
   is no longer so common for reading agents to process it.

        NOTE: using this precise method should ensure that reading
        agents that cannot display the text underlined will at least
        display it correctly in an un-underlined form.

   The formfeed character (US-ASCII 12) (which is sometimes referred to
   as the "spoiler character") MAY be used (see 3.3.2 for its effect on
   reading agents).

   In plain-text articles (those with no MIME headers, or those with a
   MIME Content-Type of "text/plain") posting agents SHOULD endeavour to
   keep the length of body lines within some reasonable limit. The size
   of this limit is a matter of policy, the default being to keep within
   79 characters at most, and preferably within 72 characters (to allow
   room for quoting in followups).

        NOTE: That policy limit (e.g. 72 or 79) should be expressed as a
        number of characters (as they will be displayed by a reading
        agent) rather than as the number of octets used to encode them.
        For use on occasions where established policy prescribes
        different line lengths (this usually arises in groups where the
        charset for the language used is best represented using double
        width characters) the preferred line length SHOULD be a
        configurable option. In addition, posting agents MUST permit the
        poster to create individual lines longer than the default or
        configured length if he so insists (which may require the
        cessation of any automatic generation of flowed lines [RFC 3676]
        on a temporary basis).

3.1.2.1.  Signatures

   A "personal signature" is a short closing text automatically added to
   the end of articles by posting agents, identifying the poster and
   giving his network addresses, etc. Whenever a poster or posting agent
   appends such a signature to an article, it MUST be preceded with a
   delimiter line containing (only) two hyphens (US-ASCII 45) followed
   by one SP (US-ASCII 32). The signature is considered to extend from
   the last occurrence of that delimiter up to the end of the article
   (or up to the end of the part in the case of a multipart MIME body).
   Posting agents SHOULD provide a facility to enable the poster to add
   such signatures, and SHOULD discourage (at least with a warning)
   signatures of excessive length (4 lines is a commonly accepted
   limit).

3.1.2.2.  Usage of MIME

   When the Content-Type is "text/plain", the recommendations and limits
   on line lengths set out above SHOULD be observed.

   Posting agents MAY use the "format=flowed" parameter of "text/plain"
   (and also the "DelSp=yes" if appropriate) defined in [RFC 3676] so as
   to allow suitably equipped reading agents to reformat flowed
   paragraphs to suit the width of their display areas. However, it must
   be understood that many reading agents do not support that feature,
   and therefore the physical length of all lines SHOULD be restricted
   to the default preferred length of 72 characters, rather than the 78
   recommended in [RFC 3676].  However, single words longer than that
   length (and this specifically applies to URIs [RFC 2396]) MUST NEVER
   be split across more than one physical line.

   Other forms of text, such as "text/html" SHOULD NOT be used except in
   groups where established policy or custom so allows (7.3).  However,
   where they are so used then, for the benefit of readers who see it

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 11]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   only in its transmitted form, the material SHOULD be "pretty-printed"
   (for example by restricting its line length as above and by keeping
   sequences which control its layout or style separate from the
   meaningful text).

   Likewise, Content-Types requiring special processing for their
   display, notably the "binary" Content-Types "image", "audio" and
   "video" (including also material encoded by the "uuencode" protocol),
   together with most "application" types, SHOULD NOT be used except in
   groups where established policy or custom so allows (7.3).
   Exceptionally, those application types defined in [RFC 1847] and [RFC
   3156] for use within "multipart/signed" articles, and the type
   "application/pgp-keys" (or other similar types containing digital
   certificates) may be used freely.

   The Content-Type "message/partial" is not recommended for textual
   articles because the Content-Type, and in particular the charset, of
   the complete article cannot be determined by examination of the
   second and subsequent parts, and hence (except when they are written
   in pure US-ASCII) it is not possible to read them as separate
   articles (as by a reader who wanted to "browse ahead" to see whether
   it was worth his while to read the whole set).  Moreover, for full
   compliance with [RFC 2046] it would be necessary to use the "quoted-
   printable" encoding to ensure the material was 7bit-safe.  In any
   case, breaking such long texts into several parts is usually
   unnecessary, since modern transport agents should have no difficulty
   in handling articles of arbitrary length.

   On the other hand, "message/partial" may be useful for binaries of
   excessive length, since reading of the individual parts on their own
   is not required and they would likely already be encoded in a manner
   that was 7bit-safe.

   The Content-Type "message/rfc822" SHOULD be used where complete news
   articles or email messages are to be included within another article
   ([USEFOR] 6.21.2).

   The Content-Type "message/external-body" could be appropriate for
   texts which it would be uneconomic (in view of the likely readership)
   to distribute to the entire network.

   The Content-Types "multipart/mixed", "multipart/parallel" and
   "multipart/signed" may be used freely in news articles.  However,
   except where policy or custom so allows, the Content-Type:
   "multipart/alternative" SHOULD NOT be used, on account of the extra
   bandwidth consumed and the difficulty of quoting in followups.

   The Content-Type: "multipart/digest" is commended for any article
   composed of multiple messages more conveniently viewed as separate
   entities, thus enabling reading agents to move rapidly between them.
   The "boundary" should be composed of 28 hyphens (US-ASCII 45) (which
   makes each boundary delimiter 30 hyphens, or 32 for the final one) so
   as to enable reading agents which currently support the digest usage
   described in [RFC 1153] to continue to operate correctly.

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

        NOTE: The various recommendations given above regarding the
        usage of particular Content-Types apply also within the
        individual parts of these multiparts.

   A multipart is preceded and followed by some spare text (a preamble
   before the first boundary and an epilogue after the last one). It is
   clear from [RFC 2046] that these texts are not to be considered part
   of the official message and SHOULD NOT be displayed by reading
   agents. It is useful for the preamble to contain words such as "This
   is a multipart message in MIME format" for the benefit of older
   reading agents that do not support MIME, but the epilogue SHOULD be
   empty and, in particular, it SHOULD NOT be used to hold the signature
   (3.1.2.1), as is sometimes done.

3.1.2.3.  Content-Transfer-Encoding

   The normal expectation ([USEFOR] 6.21.3) is that the Content-
   Transfer-Encoding will be "8bit (or maybe "7bit" if the charset
   allows it). Other Content-Transfer-Encodings SHOULD NOT be used
   unless there are pressing reasons to do so.

   The following are examples of such situations where a Content-
   Transfer-Encoding of other that "8bit" may be necessary.

   1. The content type implies that the content is (or may be) "8bit-
      unsafe"; i.e.  it may contain octets equivalent to the US-ASCII
      characters CR or LF (other than in the combination CRLF) or NUL.
      In that case one of the Content-Transfer-Encodings "base64" or
      "quoted-printable" MUST be used, and reading agents MUST be able
      to handle both of them.

        NOTE: If a future extension to the MIME standards were to
        provide a more compact encoding of binary suited to transport
        over an 8bit channel, it could be considered as an alternative
        to base64 once it had gained widespread acceptance.

   2. It is often the case that "application" Content-Types are textual
      in nature, and intelligible to humans as well as to machines, and
      where this state can be recognized by the posting agent (either
      through knowledge of the particular application type or by
      testing) the material SHOULD NOT be treated as 8bit-unsafe; this
      has the added benefit, where the posting agent uses other than
      CRLF for line endings internally, of automatically ensuring that
      line endings are processed correctly during transport.

      If, on the other hand, the posting agent recognizes that the
      material is not textual, or cannot reasonably determine it to be
      so, then the material MUST be encoded as for 8bit-unsafe (however,
      in that case, it is the responsibility of the agent generating the
      material to ensure that lines endings, if any, are represented
      correctly).




C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 13]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

        NOTE: All the application types defined by [USEFOR], namely
        "application/news-transmission", "application/news-groupinfo"
        and "application/news-checkgroups" are textual, and indeed
        designed for human reading.

   3. Although the "text" Content-Types should normally be encoded as
      8bit (or 7bit), if the character set specified by the "charset="
      parameter can include the 3 disallowed octets, then the material
      MUST be encoded as for 8bit-unsafe.  This is most likely to arise
      in the case of 16-bit character sets such as UTF-16 ([UNICODE 3.2]
      or [ISO/IEC 10646]).  In addition, where it is known that the
      material is subsequently to be gatewayed from Netnews to Email
      ([USEFOR] 8.8), the encoding "quoted-printable" MAY be used
      (otherwise the gateway might have to re-encode it itself).

   4. Some protocols REQUIRE the use of a particular Content-Transfer-
      Encoding. In particular, the authentication protocol based on
      OpenPGP defined in [RFC 3156] mandates the use of one of the
      encodings "quoted-printable" or "base64".  Whilst posters might be
      tempted to risk the use of "8bit" or "7bit" encodings (and indeed
      the referenced standard recommends that signed messages using
      those encodings be accepted and interpreted), they should be
      warned that differences in the treatment of trailing whitespace
      between OpenPGP [RFC 2440] and earlier versions of PGP may render
      signatures written with the one unverifiable by the other; and,
      moreover, Usenet articles are very likely to include trailing
      whitespace in the form of a personal signature (3.1.2.1).

   5. The Content-Type message/partial [RFC 2046] is required to use
      encoding "7bit" (the encapsulated complete message may itself use
      encoding "quoted-printable" or "base64", but that information is
      only conveyed along with the first of the partial parts).

        NOTE: Although there would actually be no problem using encoding
        "8bit" in a pure Netnews (as opposed to Email) environment, this
        document discourages the use of "message/partial" except for
        binary material, which will likely be encoded to pass through
        "7bit" in any case.

   It may be necessary to change the Content-Transfer-Encoding at
   gateways. For example in the case where such an encapsulated news
   article with the Content-Type "message/rfc822" is to be transported
   by email and it has Content-Transfer-Encoding "8bit", the Content-
   Transfer-Encoding may need to be changed, although there may well be
   no problems in practice if the email transport supports 8BITMIME [RFC
   2821].

3.2.  The Well-Behaved Followup Agent

   Usenet is primarily a medium for discussion. The majority of articles
   that are posted are in fact followups to previous articles, and
   exceedingly complex threads can develop. Therefore, it is essential
   that user agents provide facilities for followups that will enable
   such elongated discussions to proceed smoothly.

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

3.2.1.  Construction of Headers

   The requirements on inserting and editing headers already set out in
   3.1.1 still apply, and apply in particular to those headers for which
   the followup agent has set default values.

3.2.1.1.  Subject

   The Subject of the followup is, by default, taken from that of the
   precursor, but users are able to override that default; indeed they
   are to be encouraged to do so whenever appropriate in order to avoid
   long threads which have wandered far from the topic with which they
   originated, but which still adhere to the original Subject.

   It has been a long standing practice, both on Usenet and in Email, to
   prepend the back-reference "Re: " ([USEFOR] 5.4) to the Subject when
   preparing a followup, as an indication to the reader that this is a
   continuation of discussion of an earlier topic rather than the start
   of a new one. [USEFOR] does not require this practice, but permits it
   so long as it is not applied if such a back-reference is already
   present, and provided no string other that "Re: " is used for the
   purpose.

   However, the practice is not without its difficulties:

   1. Although the "Re" (which is an abbreviation for the Latin "In re",
      meaning "in the matter of", and not an abbreviation of "Reference"
      as is sometimes erroneously supposed) may be understood by English
      speakers, and indeed by speakers of most European Languages, its
      use in a newsgroup where articles were customarily written in
      Arabic, or Hindi, or Chinese would be less than helpful.

   2. It requires extra processing (to ignore it) in some reading agents
      which choose to consult the Subject-header when deciding the best
      order in which to present articles to the reader (see 3.3.1.1).
      This burden has to be weighed against the relatively small benefit
      of the indication provided directly to readers.

   3. Sometimes, followup agents attempt to use translations of "Re: "
      into other languages, as in "Sv: " and "Antwort: ". But it is not
      practicable for those reading agents which take some special note
      of "Re: " also to take note of translations into an indeterminate
      number of other languages, and for this reason [USEFOR] makes it
      clear that such translations SHOULD NOT be used.

   4. Even the presence of "Re: " at the start of a Subject may
      occasionally be misleading, because it might have been
      deliberately placed there by a poster rather than having been
      generated automatically by a followup agent.

   5. And finally, there are philosophical arguments against features
      within an unstructured header which imply specific recognition and
      support within user agents (for reason already explained in
      3.1.1.4).  Indeed, the only reason why [USEFOR] permits this

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 15]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

      particular exception is on account of its current widespread
      usage.

   For these reasons, this document does not seek to perpetuate this
   practice, and indeed it might be better if its use were eventually to
   be phased out.  Nevertheless, it is certain that it will continue to
   happen for some considerable period of time in newgroups where
   English is the primary language, simply on account of the inertia
   already behind it. For this reason, section 3.3.1.1 RECOMMENDS
   striping away any initial "Re: " when comparing Subjects.

   It would be wiser for any followup agents which are able to recognize
   non-standard back-references such as "Re(2): ", "Sv: ", etc. to
   refrain from prepending anything further, but other attempts to mend
   that problem are likely to do more harm than good.

   As well as the addition of "Re: ", the Subject-header MAY be refolded
   (which MAY include collapsing/expanding whitespace to/from a single
   SP at any point where the folding is changed). However, it MUST NOT
   (except by deliberate act of the poster) be truncated, extended or
   changed in any other way that might cause a reading agent to deduce
   that the subject of a thread had changed.
[Bruce wants users users to be requested to confirm that they are happy
with the derfault Subject as provided.]

3.2.1.1.1.  Examples

   In the following examples, please note that only "Re: " has any
   official status (and hence may be utilized by reading agents).
   "was: " is a convention used by many English-speaking posters to
   signal a change in subject matter.  Software can always recognize
   that such changes have occurred from the References-header.

      Subject: Film at 11
      Subject: Re: Film at 11
      Subject: Godwin's law considered harmful (was: Film at 11)
      Subject: Godwin's law (was: Film at 11)
      Subject: Re: Godwin's law (was: Film at 11)
      Subject: Re: Godwin's law

3.2.1.2.  Newsgroups

   Followup agents SHOULD accept articles crossposted to newsgroups
   which do not exist on their local hosts (as opposed to posting
   agents, for which that requirement is only "MAY").

3.2.1.3.  Mail-Copies-To

   If the user attempts to email the poster as well as to followup, in
   the case where the Mail-Copies-To-header is absent, and even more so
   when it is present and there is an explicit "nobody", the followup
   agent SHOULD issue a warning and ask for confirmation.



C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 16]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

        NOTE: This header is only relevant when posting followups to
        Netnews articles, and is to be ignored when sending pure email
        replies to the poster, which are handled as prescribed under the
        Reply-To-header.

3.2.1.4.  Posted-And-Mailed

        NOTE: In addition to the Posted-And-Mailed-header, some followup
        agents also include within the body a mention that the article
        is both posted and mailed, for the benefit of reading agents
        that do not normally show that header.

3.2.1.5.  References

   Followup agents SHOULD trim message identifiers out of a References-
   header but SHOULD NOT do so until the number of message identifiers
   exceeds 21, at which time trimming SHOULD be done by removing
   sufficient identifiers starting with the second from the left so as
   to bring the total down to 21 (but the first message identifier MUST
   NOT be trimmed). However, it would be wrong to assume that
   References-headers containing more than 21 message identifiers will
   not occur.

3.2.2.  Construction of Bodies

   Followup agents SHOULD follow policies already described for posting
   agents (3.1.2) regarding the length of lines when generating new text
   Exceptionally, they SHOULD NOT adjust the length of quoted lines
   (3.2.2.1) in followups unless they are able to reformat them in a
   consistent manner.

3.2.2.1.  Quoting and Attributions

   It is customary for the body of a followup to commence with an
   "attribution" referring to the "precursor" and to "quote" any text
   copied verbatim from the precursor with a suitable prefix. Followup
   agents MUST facilitate the automatic incorporation of these things,
   even though they are not mandated by any standard, in a manner
   consistent with the conventions described below.

   These conventions for quotations and attributions describe widely
   used practices. Since much software will attempt to recognize and act
   upon them, questions of interoperability can arise, and so the words
   "MUST", "SHOULD", etc. are here to be understood as more than
   advisory.

   When the precursor had used the "format=flowed" parameter of
   text/plain [RFC 3676], and when the followup agent also supports
   "format-flowed", flowed paragraphs in the precursor (including any
   flowed lines within quotations in the precursor) SHOULD be reflowed.
   Thus, if all agents supported "format=flowed", no physical line,
   quoted ot not, would ever exceed the default (or policy) limit,
   except by the deliberate intent of the poster. Where the precursor
   was not flowed, its lines SHOULD be left alone when quoting, except

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 17]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   that already quoted lines which appeared (from the presence of
   trailing SP) to have been flowed by one of the precursor's precursors
   MAY be treated as such.

   When a followup agent incorporates the "precursor" as a quotation, it
   MUST be distinguished from the surrounding text in some way, and
   SHOULD be so dintinguished by prefacing each line of the quoted text
   (even if it is empty) with the character ">" (or perhaps with "> " in
   the case of a previously unquoted line). This will result in multiple
   levels of ">" when quoted content itself contains quoted content, and
   it will also facilitate the automatic analysis of articles.

        NOTE: Whilst posters should edit quoted context to trim it down
        to the minimum necessary, followup agents SHOULD NOT attempt to
        enforce this beyond issuing a warning (past attempts to do so
        have been found to be notably counter-productive).

   The followup agent SHOULD also precede the quoted content by an
   "attribution line" (however, readers are warned not to assume that
   they are accurate, especially within multiply nested quotations). The
   following convention for such lines is intended to facilitate their
   automatic recognition and processing by sophisticated reading agents.
   The attribution SHOULD contain the name and/or the email address of
   the precursor's poster, as in
      Joe D. Bloggs <jdbloggs@foo.example> wrote:
   or
      Helmut Schmidt <helmut@bar.example> schrieb:

   The attribution MAY contain also a single newsgroup-name (the one
   from which the followup is being made), the precursor's message
   identifier and/or the precursor's Date and Time. Any of these that
   are present, SHOULD precede the name and/or email address. However,
   the inclusion or not of such fields SHOULD always be under the
   control of the poster.

   To enable this line, and the message identifier and the email address
   within it, to be recognized (for example to enable suitable reading
   agents to retrieve the precursor or email its poster by clicking on
   them), the following conventions SHOULD be observed:
     o The precursor's message identifier SHOULD be enclosed within
       <...> or <news:...>
     o The precursor's poster's email address SHOULD be enclosed within
       <...>
     o The various fields may be separated by arbitrary text and they
       may be folded in the same way as headers, but attributions SHOULD
       always be terminated by a ":" followed by CRLF.

3.2.2.2.  Signatures

   Followup agents, when incorporating quoted text from a precursor,
   SHOULD NOT include the signature in the quotation.

   Reading agents need to be prepared for ancient usages (and even non-
   compliance) which nevertheless still appear from time to time. In
   particular, the following is often seen:
      fred@foo.bar.example (Fred Bloggs)
   as opposed to
      "Fred Bloggs" <fred@foo.bar.example> .

   The former is a deprecated, but commonly encountered, usage and
   reading agents SHOULD take special note of such comments as
   indicating (e.g. in killfiles) the name of the person whose mailbox
   it is.
[Reading agents SHOULD make all headers available on user request.]
[What about headers etc that are unparseable?]

3.3.1.1.  Presentation of Articles

[The following text might be better placed in the proposed section
concerning reqirements for user interfaces, if we decide to go ahead
with that section.]

   Reading agents SHOULD present the articles in each newsgroup in an
   order which ensures that the reader never sees a followup or reply to
   an article unless he has already had an opportunity to read the
   original. However, this may be easier said than done. Here are some
   methods commonly used to fulfil this aim; none of them works
   perfectly.

   1. Present the articles in the order they were received at the local
      serving agent. However, articles propagated via different routes
      with different delays may well arrive out of order, so this may
      not be reliable.

   2. Sort the articles into order according to their Date-headers. This
      will usually be better than the first method, but relies on the
      clock and timezone settings in posting agents being approximately
      correct. And although it satisfies the minimal recommendation at
      the head of this section, it will likely result in totally
      separate threads of discussion being merged in an unhelpful order.

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   3. Sort the articles according to their Subject-headers (or group
      them according to their Subject-headers, with the groups being
      presented in order of the Date-header). Within a group with the
      same Subject, sort according to the Date-header. This works
      tolerably well, but within a long discussion with many divergent
      subthreads, those subthreads are still merged in an unhelpful
      order.  Moreover, it will occasionally bring together totally
      unrelated articles that just happen to have the same Subject by
      chance.

   4. Construct a tree in which each article is within a sub-tree headed
      by each article mentioned in its References-header, and present
      articles by a depth-first traversal of that tree, sorting the
      siblings within each branch according to their Date-headers. This
      method is usually superior to the ones mentioned earlier, but it
      can go wrong for a number of reasons.

      a)    References-headers are sometimes absent, or incomplete (and
            are even permitted to be trimmed when they get too long),
            and earlier articles in the threads may have expired off the
            local server. Nevertheless, with careful implementation,
            these problems are mostly surmountable.

      b)    A poster may join an existing discussion (and clearly intend
            to do so by using the same Subject-header, possibly with a
            prepended "Re: ") and yet his article might not be created
            as a followup to any specific precursor and hence would not
            have a References-header. Hence it would be presented quite
            apart from the other (sub-)threads of that discussion.

      c)    Conversely, the topic of some sub-thread might have diverged
            so far from the original topic of discussion that some
            poster decides to create a totally new Subject for his
            followup. Nevertheless, that followup, and the whole sub-
            thread which issues from it, will still be presented in the
            midst of the other sub-threads of the original discussion.

   5. To counter these various deficiences, various hybrid schemes have
      been devised which take account of all three headers, References-,
      Subject- and Date-, and these often succeed in providing a more
      pleasing presentation to the reader.  However, different readers
      can be pleased in different ways, and so it is often the case that
      reading agents provide configurable options to choose between
      several methods.

   This document does not single out any particular method as "the
   best". They are all to be considered acceptable, and implementors are
   encouraged to experiment accordingly. Nevertheless, it is inevitable
   that some combination of Subjects and followups will eventually arise
   that defeats even the most sophisticated scheme.

   It must be noted, however, in the case of those methods which rely on
   the comparison of Subject-headers, whether to detect equality or for
   sorting, that there are certain additional precautions that need to

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 20]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   be taken, such as:

   a) [USEFOR] permits a back-reference "Re: " to be prepended
      (optionally) to a Subject when creating a followup. Therefore,
      that back-reference SHOULD be stripped away before performing any
      comparison of Subjects. On the other hand, "Re:" is the only
      back-reference permitted, and therefore it is not necessary for
      translations of "Re: " into other languages to be recognized (even
      though such translations are sometimes generated by non-compliant
      followup agents).  Likewise, that "Re: " is case-sensitive,
      although non-compliant agents that generate "RE: " are common
      enough that it might be wiser to accept that form also.
[The above wording is subject to change according to what is finally
said in [USEFOR].]

   b) It is not unknown for non-compliant followup agents to truncate
      the Subject-header. Some reading agents therefore truncate the
      Subject before making any comparison. Sometimes this makes things
      better; sometimes it makes them worse.

   c) The use of encoded-words ([RFC 2047]) within Subject-headers can
      give rise to different ways of encoding the same Subject.
      Therefore, such encoding SHOULD be undone before any comparison of
      Subject-headers is made. It cannot even be assumed that the back-
      reference "Re: " is not within an encoded-word.
[It is possible that this matter will ultimately be addressed in
[USEFOR] rather than here.]

3.3.1.2.  Summary

   Although this header is not widely used, reading agents SHOULD make
   provision for it to be displayed if present (at least as the
   default).

3.3.2.  Interpretation of Bodies

   Implementors of reading agents need to be aware of ancient usages
   (and even non-compliance) which nevertheless still appear from time
   to time, and SHOULD endeavour to recognize them and display them
   appropriately.

   An example of this is the use of Backspace by posting agents in order
   to construct composite characters (e.g. by underlining) (3.1.2).

   Tab (US-ASCII 9) SHOULD be interpreted as sufficient horizontal white
   space to reach the next of a set of fixed positions (customarily set
   at every 8th character). Formfeed (US-ASCII 12) (which is sometimes
   referred to as the "spoiler character") signifies a point at which
   the reading agent SHOULD pause and await reader interaction before
   displaying further text.

   Reading agents MUST provide facilities to display the whole of long
   lines up to the maximum of 998 characters (whether by wrapping or by
   providing horizontal scroll bars). However, cutting and pasting of

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 21]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   wrapped lines SHOULD copy the original unwrapped line (i.e. all CRLFs
   not in the original should be discarded).

3.3.2.1.  Usage of MIME

   Even though this document, or applicable policy, may discourage the
   use of some Content-Types, all reading agents SHOULD make some
   realistic attempt to display at least all text types (especially
   where the Content-Disposition is "inline", even if all that can be
   done is to exhibit any formatting information as received (thus
   allowing a suitably knowledgeable reader to interpret it manually).

   The same applies to unrecognized charsets. It is not expected that
   reading agents will necessarily be able to present characters in all
   possible character sets (for example, a reading agent might be able
   to present only the ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters [ISO 8859]), but
   where unpresentable characters arise they SHOULD be presented in some
   escaped notation, e.g. octal or hexadecimal (rather than as some
   single distinctive glyph or by exhibiting a warning).

   Reading agents MAY interpret image, audio and video Content-Types
   inline, but few in fact do so (and the use of such Content-Types is
   anyway deprecated in the absence of established policy to the
   contrary - see 3.1.2.2).  Likewise, reading agents MAY interpret
   "application" types (and SHOULD at least display those types which
   are inherently textual in nature). However, there are security risks
   inherent in some application types, and even in "text/html" ([USEFOR]
   9.2.2).  Even requiring the reader to click on some icon before
   proceeding with the application has proven notoriously ineffective
   against malicious attacks. The only safe alternative is to execute
   the application within a protected environment, or "sandbox", outside
   of which its side effects cannot occur.

   Of the multipart Content-Types, reading agents MUST handle correctly
   at least "multipart/mixed" and "multipart/alternative". Other
   multipart types that are not implemented directly MUST be treated as
   "multipart/mixed". It is a regular practice for some Usenet articles
   to consist of digests of other messages or informative documents
   (usually known as "FAQ"s). These take the form of digests, as defined
   in [RFC 1153] or of the MIME Content-Type "multipart/digest". Reading
   agents SHOULD recognize both of these formats and enable the
   individual digest items to be presented separately, as if they were
   separate articles.

   Reading agents SHOULD honour any Content-Disposition-header that is
   provided (in particular, they SHOULD display any part of a multipart
   for which the disposition is "inline", possibly distinguished from
   adjacent parts by some suitable separator). In the absence of such a
   header, the body of an article or any part of a multipart with
   Content-Type "text" SHOULD be displayed inline.

3.4.  The Well-Behaved Reply Agent

   First and foremost, a reply agent is an Email agent, and therfore its
   primary responsibility is to generate messages that are compliant
   with [RFC 2822] and other applicable Email standards and conventions.

   When a reply is to be emailed to the poster of an article, the reply
   agent MUST initially create a To-header from the Reply-To- or From-
   header, as appropriate, of the precursor.

        NOTE: A distinction is to be made between when a reply is
        emailed to the poster of an article, and when such a reply is
        also posted during the course of generating a followup; in the
        latter case (but not the former) it is expected that any Mail-
        Copies-To header will have been observed.

        Note also that use of the Posted-And-Mailed header is
        appropriate whenever a message is both posted and emailed,
        whether or not this is done during the course of a formal
        followup.

   Since addresses ending in ".invalid" are undeliverable, reply agents
   SHOULD warn any user attempting to reply to them and SHOULD NOT, in
   any case, attempt to deliver to them (since that would be pointless
   anyway).

3.5.  User Interfaces

[At this point we need to consider whether to add a section regarding
the user interfaces to NUAs (commands/menus and the like). There is much
in the GNKSA of that nature which we might choose to adopt. Indeed, the
next step should be a careful comparison of what is contained in the
GNKSA and what has been said here, since there are undoubtedly cases
where are requirements are less strict that those put forward in the
GNKSA, and vice versa. Such a comparison might suggest some further
changes and features to be considered for this draft.]

4.  The Well-Behaved Injecting Agent

   The injecting agent bears a responsibility towards the rest of the
   network for ensuring both that the articles it injects are compliant
   with [USEFOR], and that they conform with the general expectations of
   the rest of the network as to what constitutes "proper behaviour".
   [USEFOR] therefore imposes a duty on it to check articles for
   compliance rather thoroughly, but also a general duty to be
   responsive to complaints concerning the behaviour of those who are
   permitted to post through it.

   An injecting agent MAY take account of the policies of any newsgroups
   or hierarchies that the article is posted to (though it would be
   unreasonable to expect it to be aware of the policies and
   idiosyncrasies of all the hierarchies that it might encounter).



C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 23]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   As part of their responsibility for the actions of their posters,
   injecting agents MAY cancel articles which they have previously
   injected ([USEFOR] 7.3).
[That paragraph will move back to USEFOR if the rules governing who may
issue cancels are moved back.]

4.1.  Construction of Headers

   According to [USEFOR], an injecting agent MAY add other headers not
   already provided by the poster, but SHOULD NOT alter, delete, or
   reorder any existing header.  However, the addition of non-mandatory
   headers by the injecting agent may alter the posting agent's
   preferred presentation of information.

   Insofar as the injecting agent needs to add headers not present in
   the proto-article (whether mandatory headers or otherwise), it MUST
   also behave as a well-behaved posting agent (3.1) with regard to
   those headers, including the insertion of appropriate folding so as
   to keep line lengths within the accepted limits.

4.1.1.  Sender

   The generation of the Sender-header is to be regarded as the
   responsibility of the posting agent. Although adding this header by
   injecting agents is not forbidden by [USEFOR] (though overwriting an
   existing one is), and although some agents indeed do so, this
   practice SHOULD be phased out. Exposing a sender's mailbox has
   privacy implications; where the main or only purpose for doing so is
   as tracing information, it is preferable to use instead one of the
   options provided for the Injection-Info-header.

4.1.2.  Organization

   The general discouragement from providing a default value for this
   header (3.1.1.7) applies even more to injecting agents. Where all the
   posters using a given injecting agent belong to a single
   organization, including the name of that organization as the default
   might well be reasonable. But if the injecting agent is merely
   providing a service to the general public, providing the name of the
   service provider as the default organization is mere advertising, and
   makes no allowance for the possibility that subscribers to the
   service who do not provide an Organization-header of their own might
   prefer not to have one at all.

4.1.3.  User-Agent

   There is provision in [USEFOR] for injecting agents to include (or
   augment if already present) a User-Agent-header to identify the
   software that they use but, again, use as an advertising medium (in
   the mundane sense) is discouraged (cf. 3.1.1.10).





C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 24]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

4.1.4.  Injection-Info

   Various headers such as NNTP-Posting-[Host, Date, etc.] (which
   actually had nothing to do with NNTP) and X-trace have not been
   standardized in [USEFOR], but have instead been incporporated in the
   new Injection-Info-header (whose syntax incorporates more room for
   future extension). Use of those headers SHOULD therefore be phased
   out.

   The purpose of the various parameters of the Injection-Info-header is
   to enable the injecting agent to make assertions about the origin of
   the article, in fulfilment of its responsibilities towards the rest
   of the network.  These assertions can then be utilized as follows:

   1. To enable the administrator of the injecting agent to respond to
      complaints and queries concerning the article. For this purpose,
      the parameters included SHOULD be sufficient to enable the
      administrator to identify its true origin (which parameters are
      best suited to this purpose will vary with the nature of the
      injecting site and of its relationship to the posters who use it -
      there is no benefit in including parameters which contribute
      nothing to this aim).  An administrator MAY, with those parameters
      where the syntax so allows, use cryptic notations interpretable
      only by himself if he considers it appropriate to protect the
      privacy of that origin.

   2. To enable relaying, serving and reading agents to recognize
      articles from origins which they might wish to reject, divert, or
      otherwise handle specially, for reasons of site policy.

   3. To enable the timely identification of spews of articles arising
      from a common origin.

        NOTE: Administrators of injecting agents can choose which
        selection of the various parameters best enables them to fulfil
        their responsibilities.  Some of these parameters identify the
        source of the article explicitly whereas others do so
        indirectly, thus affording more privacy to posters who value
        their anonymity, but also making harder the tracking of
        malicious disruption of the network, especially so if the
        administrators choose not to cooperate.  There is thus a balance
        to be struck between the needs of privacy on the one hand and
        the good order of Usenet on the other, and administrators need
        to be aware of this when formulating their policies.

5.  The Well-Behaved Relaying Agent

   [USEFOR] establishes as a basic principle that relaying agents are
   not to alter articles in any way during transmission (except for
   those headers explicitly defined to be "variant"). This applies even
   if the article is perceived not to be conformant with [USEFOR]; in
   such a case it MUST either be passed on as it stands, or else it
   should be discarded altogether. In this way, it will be ensured that
   all copies of a given article, wherever they appear throughout

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 25]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   Usenet, will be identical.

   In particular, [USEFOR] requires serving and relaying agents to
   accept any syntactially correct newsgroup-name in Newsgroups-headers,
   even if it would violate one or more of the policy restrictions set
   out in section 7.2; i.e. the injecting agent is the last place for
   such checks to be made (3.1.1.5).

5.1.  The Path Header

   It is important to be able to determine where a given article was
   injected into Usenet and the route it took to reach each site at
   which it appears. Both the Path- and Injection-Info-headers have an
   important part to play in this. [USEFOR] therefore imposes a strong
   obligation on relaying agents to verify where articles reached them
   from and to record this information in the Path-header.  It is
   important that these new requirements in [USEFOR] be adopted by all
   injecting and relaying agents at the earliest opportunity.

5.1.1.  Suggested Verification Methods

   It is preferable to verify the claimed path-identity against the
   source than to make routine use of the '?' path-delimiter ([USEFOR]
   5.6.1), with consequential wasteful double-entry Path additions.

   If the incoming article arrives through some TCP/IP protocol such as
   NNTP, the IP address of the source will be known, and will likely
   already have been checked against a list of known FQDNs, IP
   addresses, or other registered aliases that the receiving site has
   agreed to peer with.

   Since the source host may have several IP addresses, checking the
   claimed FQDN or IP address against the source IP, or finding a
   suitable FQDN to report with a '?' path-delimiter, may involve
   several DNS lookups, following CNAME chains as required. Note that
   any reverse DNS lookup that is involved needs to be confirmed by a
   forward one.

   If the incoming article arrives through some other protocol, such as
   UUCP, that protocol MUST include a means of verifying the source
   site. In UUCP implementations, commonly each incoming connection has
   a unique login name and password, and that login name (or some alias
   registered for it) would be expected as the path-identity.

   If none of these methods is applicable, relaying agents SHOULD
   require connecting hosts to identify themselves using some
   cryptographic authentication mechanism.
[What references should be given here? SASL?]

6.  The Well-Behaved Serving Agent

   The principles set out in section 5 regarding not altering articles
   in any way apply equally to serving agents.  The article as stored
   MUST be identical to the article as injected (variant headers

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 26]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   excepted).


6.1.  Control Messages

   Serving agents SHOULD deny group control messages ([USEFOR] 7.2) not
   issued by the appropriate administrative agencies, and therefore
   SHOULD take such steps as are reasonably practicable to validate
   their authenticity, e.g. by checking digital signatures in cases
   where they are provided.

6.1.1.  The 'newgroup' and 'mvgroup' Control Messages

   Serving agents SHOULD, insofar as they are conveniently able to,
   reject all 'newgroup' and 'mvgroup' messages not meeting the policies
   of the relevant hierarchy.

   Since the 'mvgroup' control message was a feature newly introduced by
   [USEFOR], the requirements set for it were relatively light, so as to
   facilitate a rapid deployment within Usenet (treating it as a
   'newgroup' message is minimally conformant). Nevertheless, to achieve
   full benefit, serving agents need to arrange to service requests for
   access to the old group by providing access to the new. [USEFOR]
   states how that MAY be done, but this documents goes further; serving
   agents SHOULD be upgraded to do so at the earliest opportunity.

6.1.2.  Cancel Messages

   A cancel message may be issued in the following circumstances.

   1. The poster of an article (or, more specifically, any entity
      mentioned in the From-header or the Sender-header, whether or not
      that entity was the actual poster) is always entitled to issue a
      cancel message for that article, and serving agents SHOULD honour
      such requests. Posting agents SHOULD facilitate the issuing of
      cancel messages by posters fulfilling these criteria.

   2. The agent which injected the article onto the network (more
      specifically, the entity identified by the path-identity in front
      of the leftmost '%' delimiter in the Path-header or in the
      Injection-Info-header and, where appropriate, the moderator (more
      specifically, any entity mentioned in the Approved-header) is
      always entitled to issue a cancel message for that article, and
      serving agents SHOULD honour such requests.

   3. Other entities MAY be entitled to issue a cancel message for that
      article, in circumstances where established policy for any
      hierarchy or group in the Newsgroup-header, or established custom
      within Usenet, so allows (such policies and customs are not
      defined by this document). Such cancel messages MUST include an
      Approved-header identifying the responsible entity. Serving agents
      MAY honour such requests, but SHOULD first take steps to verify
      their appropriateness.

[There was one request to move that back into [USEFOR].  Any one else?]


7.  The Well-Behaved Hierarchy Administrator

   The term "hierarchy administrator" means any agency responsible for
   administration of a (sub-)hierarchy (1.1), or in the absence of such
   an agency, the custom and usage generally accepted for that
   (sub-)hierarchy, insofar as such can be determined.

7.1.  Control Messages

   In those hierarchies where appropriate administrative agencies exist
   (see 1.1), group control messages SHOULD NOT be issued except as
   authorized by those agencies, in which case the administrator needs
   to establish just what person (or other entity) is to be permitted to
   issue those messages; moreover he should at the same time establish s
   digital signature key to be used for authenticating them ([USEFOR]
   7.1), and finally he SHOULD ensure that this information is widely
   promulgated for use by serving agents worldwide.

   For compatibility with legacy news software, the Subject-content of a
   control message (i.e. an article that also contains a Control-header)
   MAY start with the string "cmsg ", and non-control messages SHOULD
   NOT start with the string "cmsg ".
[SHOULD NOT changed from MUST NOT. Do there really still exist servers
or other agents that will recognize and act upon "cmsg" in a Subject-
header? And if so, maybe that MUST NOT should be moved back into
[USEFOR].]

   The newsgroup-name in 'newgroup' control messages (and the second
   (new-)newsgroup-name in 'mvgroup' control messages) SHOULD conform to
   whatever policies have been established by the administrator (7.2).

   Although, in accordance with [RFC 2822] and [USEFOR], a newsgroups-
   line (as found in both 'newgroup' and 'checkgroups' messages) could
   have a maximum length of 998 octets, as a matter of policy a far
   lower limit, expressed in characters, SHOULD be set. The current
   convention is to limit its length so that the newsgroup-name, the
   HTAB(s) (interpreted as 8-character tabs that takes one at least to
   column 24) and the newsgroup-description (excluding any moderation-
   flag) fit into 79 characters.  This document does not seek to enforce
   any such rule, but any decision to extend it should be made as a
   specific decision for the hierarchy. Reading agents SHOULD therefore
   enable a newsgroups-line of any length to be displayed, e.g. by
   wrapping it as required.

7.2.  Naming of Newsgroups

   Because group control messages can only be issued on the authority of
   the responsible agency, it follows that the agency has complete
   control of the names of the newsgroups to be considered as valid
   members of that (sub-)hierarchy.  Consequently, it needs to establish
   policies for the format of the newsgroup-names it intends to permit;

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 28]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   these policies can be both technical and aesthetic.

   [USEFOR] provides by default the following technical restrictions
   upon which hierarchy administrators can then build, and which SHOULD
   in any case be applied in hierarchies not subject to such management.

        NOTE: These restrictions are intended to reflect existing
        practice and are intended both to avoid certain technical
        difficulties and to avoid unnecessary confusion. They may well
        change over time in the light of future experience.

   1. Uppercase letters are forbidden.

        NOTE: Traditionally, newsgroup-names have been written in
        lowercase. However, posting agents SHOULD NOT convert uppercase
        characters to the corresponding lowercase forms except under the
        explicit instructions of the poster.

   2. A component name is forbidden to consist entirely of digits.

        NOTE: This requirement was in [RFC 1036] but nevertheless
        several such groups have appeared in practice and implementors
        should be prepared for them. A common implementation technique
        uses each component as the name of a directory and uses numeric
        filenames for each article within a group. Such an
        implementation needs to be careful when this could cause a clash
        (e.g. between article 123 of group xxx.yyy and the directory for
        group xxx.yyy.123).  Once the latter group exists, the
        subsequent creation of the former would be precluded for all
        time.

   3. A component is limited to 30 component-graphemes and a newsgroup-
      name to 66 component-graphemes (counting also the '.'s separating
      the components).

        NOTE: Whilst there is no longer any technical reason to limit
        the length of a component (formerly, it was limited to 14
        octets) nor of a newsgroup-name, it should be noted that these
        names are also used in the newsgroups-line where another overall
        policy limit applies (7.1) and, moreover, excessively long names
        can be exceedingly inconvenient in practical use. The 66 limit
        on newsgroup-names ensures that a Followup-To-Header with such a
        name will still fit within 79 characters overall.

   In the event that some future extension to [USEFOR] allows
   internationalized newsgroup-names including non-ASCII characters,
   there will be further technical issues to be taken into account,
   including:

   4. What non-ASCII punctuations and other symbols are to be allowed.

   5. What normalizations need to be observed to overcome multiple ways
      of constructing glyphs with identical or similar appearance.

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   6. Restrictions on mixing alphabets within one component of a name
      (so as to avoid confusion between, for example, Latin A and Greek
      Alpha, and similar confusions between some Latin and Cyrillic
      letters - though retaining the restriction on uppercase letters
      will mitigate these problems somewhat).

   Aesthetic reasons for policy limitations are likely to include
   insistence upon a clear hierarchical structure (the tree of names
   needs to be neither too broad nor too deep), that the components of
   newsgroup-names are meaningful in the context of the language(s)
   expected to be used, that frivolous names are avoided, and that
   abbreviations are likely to be recognized by the intended readership.
[David Wright has a FAQ on hierarchical naming which might give us some
help.]

7.3.  Format of Bodies

   Hierarchy administrators MAY declare, as a matter of policy, which
   languages and charsets are to be considered appropriate within their
   hierarchies (or within particular groups).  Whereas in principle, any
   character set may be specified in the "charset=" parameter of a
   Content-Type, readers cannot be expected to possess agents capable of
   displaying characters not needed for those chosen languages, hence
   administrators SHOULD choose charsets accordingly and/or limit the
   planes to be allowed within charsets based on [UNICODE 3.2], such
   UTF-8.

   The document has already provided (3.1.2,3.2.2) for a default limit
   on the length of lines (79, or preferably 72) within plain-text
   articles, and hierarchy administrators MAY change this, as a matter
   of policy (though there would seems to be little reason to do so
   except where the intended language and charsets so dictate - e.g.
   because of a need to use double-width characters).

   This document has also limited (3.1.2.2), by default, the Content-
   types that may be used in articles to "text/plain".  Hierarchy
   administrators MAY relax this, as a matter of policy (by allowing,
   for example, "text/http", the "binary" types "audio", "image" and
   "video", and selected "application" types), and they MAY similarly
   regulate the use of "message/partial".

   Hierarchy administrators MAY also impose other restrictions relevant
   to the nature of their hierarchy, such as limits on the overall size
   of articles, on the length of signatures, the topics to be discussed
   (usually set out in a charter for each newsgroup) and the extent of
   advertising to be permitted.

7.4.  Promulgation

   The policies established by each hierarchy administrator SHOULD be
   publicised (in the form of guidelines, FAQs and charters) in suitable
   *.announce groups within each hierarchy, and also on suitable web
   sites (although it should be understood that Usenet exists as a
   separate entity from the World Wide Web, and it would be wrong to

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 30]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

   assume that every Usenet user has web - or even email - access).

        NOTE: The promulgation of policies is one thing; the enforcement
        of policies is quite another. With the exception of newsgroup-
        names, for which technical controls exist, policy enforcement is
        a matter of peer pressure (which, when consistently applied, can
        be remarkably effective), possibly with the aid of the
        administrators of injecting agents through their ability, and
        even duty (4), to apply disciplinary pressure to their users.

8.  The Well-Behaved Moderator

   A moderator MAY inform the poster if an article is accepted, and he
   SHOULD inform the poster if it is rejected (except where it appears
   to be a deliberate and malicious attempt to disrupt).

   A moderator SHOULD NOT (absent any established and widely promulgated
   policy to the contrary) remove any newsgroup-name from the
   Newsgroups-header, nor split an article into two versions with
   disjoint Newsgroups-headers. These are matters more usually within
   the prerogative of the poster; moreover splitting can lead to
   fragmentation of threads.

9.  The Well-Behaved Poster

[What you see here is but the tip of a very large iceberg, being the
particular advice to posters which has been transported the earlier
drafts of [USEFOR].  There is much more that could, and probably should,
be said.

However, it would first be advsisable to study [RFC 1855] and to decide
whether we want to adopt and adapt what is already stated there, even to
the extent of obsoleting it entirely.]

9.1.  Construction of Headers

   Posters SHOULD NOT include redundant headers such as Reply-To and
   Followup-To that merely duplicate the defaults (c.f. 3.1.1.6 and
   3.1.1.9).

9.1.1.  From

   Whether or not a valid address can subsequently be extracted from an
   address ending in ".invalid" falls outside the scope of this document
   but, obviously, posters wishing to disguise their address should not
   suppose that just adding ".invalid" to it will achieve that effect.

9.1.2.  Summary

   The summary should be terse. Posters SHOULD avoid trying to cram
   their entire article into the headers; even the simplest query
   usually benefits from a sentence or two of elaboration and context,
   and not all reading agents display all headers. On the other hand the
   summary should give more detail than the Subject.

C. H. Lindsey                                                  [Page 31]

                          Usenet Best Practice                  May 2004

9.1.3.  Expires

   An Expires-header should only be used in an article if the requested
   expiry time is earlier or later than the time typically to be
   expected for such articles. Local policy for each serving agent will
   dictate whether and when this header is obeyed and posters SHOULD NOT
   depend on it being completely followed.

9.2.  Construction of Bodies

   Posters SHOULD avoid using control characters and escape sequences
   except for tab (US-ASCII 9), formfeed (US-ASCII 12) and, possibly,
   backspace (US-ASCII 8), for reasons already explained in section
   3.3.2.

        NOTE: Backspace was historically used for underlining, done by
        an underscore (US-ASCII 95), a backspace, and a character,
        repeated for each character that should be underlined. Posters
        are warned that underlining is not available on all output
        devices or supported by all reading agents and is best not
        relied on for essential meaning.

   When preparing followups, posters SHOULD edit quoted context to trim
   it down to the minimum necessary.

   Posters SHOULD observe the policies established for each hierarchy
   (7.3) or, in the absence of such policies, to the defaults set out in
   this document, as regards:
     o The languages and charsets to be used;
     o The length of lines;
     o The acceptability of various Content-Types, and especially of
       "text/html" and the "binary" types;
     o Conventions regarding the advisability of using
       "message/partial";
     o Limits on the overall size of articles;
     o The topics to discussed in each group, as determined by its
       charter;
     o The acceptability of advertising.
