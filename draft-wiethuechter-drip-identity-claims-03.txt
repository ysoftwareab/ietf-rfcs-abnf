1.  Introduction

   DRIP Proofs are the backbone of trust in DRIP UAS RID, consisting of
   a chain of special certificates/attestations that results in a
   something useful in Broadcast RID.  Some of the certificates are
   stored in and are generated by the Registries (defined in
   [hhit-registries]) and allow a user to confirm the trustworthiness of
   an Unmanned Aircraft (herein referred to as Aircraft) even in the
   scenario that the Observer is disconnected from the Internet.

1.1.  Claims, Assertions, Attestations, and Certificates

   The authors wish to make a clear distinction on exactly what these
   terms mean in the context of DRIP.

   This is due to the term "certificate" having significant technologic
   and legal baggage associated with it, specifically around X.509
   certificates.  These type of certificates and Public Key
   Infrastructure invokes more legal and public policy considerations
   than probably any other electronic communication sector.  It emerged
   as a governmental platform for trusted identity management and was
   pursued in intergovernmental bodies with links into treaty
   instruments.

   As such much discussion has been made around the terms being used.

1.1.1.  Claims

   For DRIP claims are used in the form of a predicate (X is Y, X has
   property Y, and most importantly X owns Y).  The basic form of a
   claim is an entity using a HHIT as an identifier in the DRIP UAS
   system.

1.1.2.  Assertions

   Assertions, under DRIP, are defined as being a set of one or more
   claims.  This definition is borrowed from JWT/CWT.  An HHIT in of
   itself is a set of assertions.  First that the identifier is unique
   and is a handle to an asymmetric keypair owned by the entity and that
   it also is part of the given registry (specified by the HID).

1.1.3.  Attestations

   An attestation is a signed claim.  The signee may be the claimant
   themselves or a third party.  Under DRIP this is normally used when a
   set of entities asserts a relationship between them along with other
   information.

1.1.4.  Certificates

   Certificates in DRIP have a narrow definition of being signed
   exclusively by a third party and are only over identities.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Required Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Definitions

   See [drip-requirements] for common DRIP terms.

   HDA:  Hierarchial HIT Domain Authority.  The 16 bit field identifying
      the HIT Domain Authority under a RAA.

   HID:  Hierarchy ID.  The 32 bit field providing the HIT Hierarchy ID.

   RAA:  Registered Assigning Authority.  The 16 bit field identifying
      the Hierarchical HIT Assigning Authority.

3.  DRIP Proofs

   The DRIP Proofs is a set of custom structures to be used in the USS/
   UTM system.  They are created during the provision of an Aircraft and
   are tied to the UAS ID (expected to be a HHIT, see [drip-rid] for
   details).

   These structures when chained together can create a root of trust all
   the way back to the manufacturer itself during the initial production
   of a given Aircraft.  The chain can also be used by authorized
   entities to trace an Aircraft through all owners and flights in the
   Aircraft's lifetime (something of interest to ICAO).

   The rest of this section will define the formats of proofs in DRIP as
   forms of certificates and attestations and their common uses.

3.1.  Certificate: X on X (Cxx Form)

   The Cxx Form of DRIP Proofs is a self-signed certificate (by an
   entity known as 'X') staking an unverified claim on a HHIT/HI pairing
   until an expiration date/time.

                       Figure 1: Certificate: X on X

   Certificates of the Cxx Form are 116 bytes.  The offset of the
   Expiration Timestamp SHOULD be of significant length (possibly
   years).

   These are 5 (five) Cxx Certificates that can be created in a standard
   DRIP UAS RID system: Manufacturer on Manufacturer, RAA on RAA, HDA on
   HDA (Registry on Registry), Operator on Operator, and Aircraft on
   Aircraft.  This is not an exhaustive list as any entity with the DRIP
   UAS system SHOULD have a Cxx for itself.

   Axy Form wraps both self-signed certificates of the entities and is
   signed by Entity X.  Two timestamps, one taken at the time of signing
   and one as an expiration time are used to set boundaries to the

   Expiration Timestamp is set, but is left up to system policy.

   Most attestations of this form have a length of 304 bytes.

3.3.  Timestamps

   Timestamps MAY be the standard UNIX time or a protocol specific
   timestamp, to avoid programming complexities.  For example [F3411-19]
   uses a 00:00:00 01/01/2019 offset.  When a Expiration Timestamp is
   required a desired offset is added, setting the timestamp into the
   future.  The amount of offset for specific timestamps is left to best
   practice.

3.4.  Signatures

   Signatures are ALWAYS taken over the preceding fields in the
   certificate/attestation.  For DRIP the EdDSA25519 algorithm from
   [RFC8032] is used.

4.  Provisioning

   Under DRIP UAS RID a special provisioning procedure is required to
   properly generate and distribute the certificates and attestations to
   all parties in the USS/UTM ecosystem using DRIP RID.

   Keypairs are expected to be generated on the device hardware it will
   be used on.  Due to hardware limitations (see Section 5) and
   connectivity it is acceptable under DRIP RID to generate keypairs for
   the Aircraft on Operator devices and later securely inject them into
   the Aircraft (as defined in Section 4.5.2).  The methods to securely
   inject and store keypair information in a "secure element" of the
   Aircraft is out of scope of this document.

4.1.  HHIT Delegation

   Under the FAA [NPRM], it is expecting that IDs for UAS are assigned
   by the UTM and are generally one-time use.  The methods for this
   however are unspecified leaving two options.

   1  The entity generates its own HHIT, discovering and using thr RAA
      and HDA for the target Registry.  The method for discovering a
      Registry's RAA and HDA is out of scope here.  This allows for the
      device to generate an HHIT to send to the Registry to be accepted
      (thus generating the required Host Identity Claim) or denied.

   2  The entity sends to the Registry its HI for it to be hashed and
      result in the HHIT.  The Registry would then either accept
      (returning the HHIT to the device) or deny this pairing.

   In either case the Registry must decide on if the HI/HHIT pairing is
   valid.  This in its simplest form is checking the current Registry
   for a collision on the HHIT.

Internet-Draft               identity-claims               November 2020


   Upon accepting a HI/HHIT pair the Registry MUST populate the required
   the DNS serving the HDA with the HIP RR and other relevant RR types
   (such as TXT and CERT).  The Registry MUST also generate the
   appropriate Host Identity Claim for the given operation.

   If the Registry denied the HI/HHIT pair, because there was a HHIT
   collision or any other reason, the Registry MUST signal back to the
   device being provisioned that a new HI needs to be generated.

   During the initial configuration and production at the factory the
   Aircraft MUST be configured to have a serial number.  ASTM defines
   this to be an ANSI/CTA-2063A.  Under DRIP a HHIT can be encoded as
   such to be able to convert back and forth between them.  This is out
   of scope for this document.

   Under DRIP the Manufacturer SHOULD be using HHITs and have their own
   keypair and Cxx (Certificate: Manufacturer on Manufacturer).  (Ed.
   Note: some words on aircraft keypair and certs here?).

   Certificate: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft 0 (Ca0a0) is extracted by the
   manufacturer and send to their Certificate Authority (CA) to be
   verified and added.  A resulting certificate (Attestation:
   Manufacturer on Aircraft 0) SHOULD be a DRIP Attestation in the Axy
   Form - however this could be a X.509 certificate binding the serial
   number to the manufacturer.

4.3.  Registry

   TODO

   DRIP UAS RID defines two levels of hierarchy maintained by the
   Registration Assigning Authority (RAA) and HHIT Domain Authority
   (HDA).  The authors anticipate that an RAA is owned and operated by a

   regional CAA (or a delegated party by an CAA in a specific airspace
   region) with HDAs being contracted out.  As such a chain of trust for
   registries is required to ensure trustworthiness is not compromised.
   More information on the registries can be found in [hhit-registries].

   Both the RAA and HDA generate their own keypairs and self-signed
   certificates (Certificate: RAA on RAA and Certificate: HDA on HDA
   respectively).  The HDA sends to the RAA its self-signed certificate
   to be added into the RAA DNS.

   The RAA confirms the certificate received is valid and that no HHIT
   collisions occur before added a HIP RR to its DNS for the new HDA.
   An Attestation: RAA on HDA is sent as a confirmation that
   provisioning was successful.

   The HDA is now a valid "Registry" and uses its keypair and
   Certificate: HDA on HDA with all provisioning requests from
   downstream.

   The Operator generates a keypair and HHIT as specified in DRIP UAS
   RID.  A self-signed certificate (Certificate: Operator on Operator)
   is generated and sent to the desired Registry (HDA).  Other relevant
   information and possibly personally identifiable information needed
   may also be required to be sent to the Registry (all over a secure
   channel - the method of which is out of scope for this document).

   The Registry cross checks any personally identifiable information as
   required.  Certificate: Operator on Operator is verified (both using
   the expiration timestamp and signature).  The HHIT is searched in the
   Registries database to confirm that no collision occurs.  A new
   attestation is generated (Attestation: Registry on Operator) and sent
   securely back to the Operator.  Optionally the HHIT/HI pairing can be
   added to the Registries DNS in to form of a HIP Resource Record (RR).

   Other RRs, such as CERT and TXT, may also be used to hold public
   information.

   With the receipt of Attestation: Registry on Operator the
   provisioning of an Operator is complete.

4.5.  Aircraft

4.5.1.  Standard Provisioning

   Under standard provisioning the Aircraft has its own connectivity to
   the Registry, the method which is out of scope for this document.

   Through mechanisms not specified in this document the Aircraft should
   have methods to instruct the Aircrafts onboard systems to generate a
   keypair and certificate.  This certificate is chained to the factory
   provisioned certificate (Certificate: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft 0).
   This new attestation (Attestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft N) is
   securely extracted by the Operator.

   With Attestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft N the sub certificate
   (Certificate: Aircraft N on Aircraft N) is used by the Operator to
   generate Attestation: Operator on Aircraft N.  This along with
   Attestation: Registry on Operator is sent to the Registry.

   On the Registry, Attestation: Registry on Operator is verified and
   used as confirmation that the Operator is already registered.
   Attestation: Operator on Aircraft N also undergoes a validation check
   and used to generate a token to return to the Operator to continue
   provisioning.

   Upon receipt of this token, the Operator injects it into the Aircraft
   and its used to form a secure connection to the Registry.  The
   Aircraft then sends Attestation: Manufacturer on Aircraft 0 and
   Attestation: Aircraft 0 to Aircraft N.

   The Registry uses Attestation: Manufacturer on Aircraft 0 (with an
   external database if supported) to confirm the validity of the
   Aircraft.  Attestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft N is correlated with
   Attestation: Operator on Aircraft N and Attestation: Manufacturer on
   Aircraft 0 to see the chain of ownership.  The new HHIT tied to
   Aircraft N is then checked for collisions in the HDA.  With the
   information the Registry generates two certificates: Attestation:
   Registry on Operator on Aircraft N and Attestation: Registry on
   Aircraft N (Offline Form).  A HIP RR (and other RR types as needed)
   are generated and inserted into the HDA.

   Attestation: Registry on Operator on Aircraft N is sent via a secure
   channel back to the Operator to be stored.  Attestation: Registry on
   Aircraft N (Offline Form) is sent to the Aircraft to be used in
   Broadcast RID.

4.5.2.  Operator Assisted Provisioning

   This provisioning scheme is for when the Aircraft is unable to
   connect to the Registry itself or does not have the hardware required
   to generate keypairs and certificates.

               Figure 9: Operator Assisted Provision: Step 1

   To start the Operator generates on behalf of the Aircraft a new
   keypair and Certificate: Aircraft N on Aircraft N.  This keypair and
   certificate are injected into the Aircraft for it to generate
   Attestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft N.  After injecting the keypair
   and certificate, the Operator MUST destroy all copies of the keypair.

   Registry on Operator on Aircraft N and Attestation: Registry on
   Aircraft N (Offline Form).  Both are sent back to the Operator.

   The Operator securely inject Attestation: Registry on Aircraft N
   (Offline Form) and securely stores Attestation: Registry on Operator
   on Aircraft N.

4.5.3.  Initial Provisioning

   A special form of provisioning is used when the Aircraft is first
   sold to an Operator.  Instead of generating a new keypair, the built
   in keypair and certificate done by the Manufacturer is used to
   provision and register the aircraft to the owner.

   For this either Standard or Operator Assisted methods can be used.

5.  Security Considerations

   A major consideration is the optimization done in Attestation: X on Y
   (Short Form) to get its length down to 200 bytes.  The truncation of
   Certificate: HDA on HDA down to just its HHIT is one that could be
   used against the system to act as a false Registry.  For this to
   occur an attacker would need to find a hash collision on that
   Registry HHIT and then manage to spoof all of DNS being used in the
   system.

   The authors believe that the probability of such an attack is low
   when Registry operators are using best practices in security.  If
   such an attack can occur (especially in the time frame of "one-time
   use IDs") then there are more serious issues present in the system.
