                         DNS Queries over HTTPS
                   draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https-03

Abstract

   DNS queries sometimes experience problems with end to end
   connectivity at times and places where HTTPS flows freely.

   HTTPS provides the most practical mechanism for reliable end to end
   communication.  Its use of TLS provides integrity and confidentiality
   guarantees and its use of HTTP allows it to interoperate with
   proxies, firewalls, and authentication systems where required for
   transit.

   This document describes how to run DNS service over HTTP using
   https:// URIs.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet does not always provide end to end reachability for
   native DNS.  On-path network devices may spoof DNS responses, block

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


   DNS requests, or just redirect DNS queries to different DNS servers
   that give less-than-honest answers.

   Over time, there have been many proposals for using HTTP and HTTPS as
   a substrate for DNS queries and responses.  To date, none of those
   proposals have made it beyond early discussion, partially due to
   disagreement about what the appropriate formatting should be and
   partially because they did not follow HTTP best practices.

   This document defines a specific protocol for sending DNS [RFC1035]
   queries and getting DNS responses over HTTP [RFC7540] using https://
   (and therefore TLS [RFC5246] security for integrity and
   confidentiality).  Each DNS query-response pair is mapped into a HTTP
   request-response pair.

   The described approach is more than a tunnel over HTTP.  It
   establishes default media formatting types for requests and responses
   but uses normal HTTP content negotiation mechanisms for selecting
   alternatives that endpoints may prefer in anticipation of serving new
   use cases.  In addition to this media type negotiation, it aligns
   itself with HTTP features such as caching, proxying, and compression.

   The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for both
   traditional DNS clients and native web applications seeking access to
   the DNS.

2.  Terminology

   A server that supports this protocol is called a "DNS API server" to
   differentiate it from a "DNS server" (one that uses the regular DNS
   protocol).  Similarly, a client that supports this protocol is called
   a "DNS API client".

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Use Cases

   There are two initial use cases for this protocol.

   The primary use case is to prevent on-path network devices from
   interfering with DNS operations.  This interference includes, but is
   not limited to, spoofing DNS responses, blocking DNS requests, and
   tracking.

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


   In this use, clients - whether operating systems or individual
   applications - will be explicitly configured to use a DOH server as a
   recursive resolver by its user (or administrator).  They might use
   the DOH server for all queries, or only for a subset of them.  The
   specific configuration mechanism is out of scope for this document.

   A secondary use case is allowing web applications to access DNS
   information, by using existing APIs in browsers to access it over
   HTTP in a safe way consistent with Cross Origin Resource Sharing
   (CORS) [CORS].

   This is technically already possible (since the server controls both
   the HTTP resources it exposes and the use of browser APIs by its
   content), but standardization might make this easier to accomplish.

   Note that in this second use, the browser does not consult the DOH
   server or use its responses for any DNS lookups outside the scope of
   the application using them; i.e., there is (currently) no API that
   allows a Web site to poison DNS for others.

   [[ This paragraph is to be removed when this document is published as
   an RFC ]] Note that these use cases are different than those in a
   similar protocol described at [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-wireformat-http].
   The use case for that protocol is proxying DNS queries over HTTP
   instead of over DNS itself.  The use cases in this document all
   involve query origination instead of proxying.

4.  Protocol Requirements

   The protocol described here bases its design on the following
   protocol requirements:

   o  The protocol must use normal HTTP semantics.

   o  The queries and responses must be able to be flexible enough to
      express every normal DNS query.

   o  The protocol must allow implementations to use HTTP's content
      negotiation mechanism.

   o  The protocol must ensure interoperable media formats through a
      mandatory to implement format wherein a query must be able to
      contain future modifications to the DNS protocol including the
      inclusion of one or more EDNS extensions (including those not yet
      defined).

   o  The protocol must use a secure transport that meets the
      requirements for HTTPS.

4.1.  Non-requirements

   o  Supporting network-specific DNS64 [RFC6147]

   o  Supporting other network-specific inferences from plaintext DNS
      queries

   o  Supporting insecure HTTP

   o  Supporting legacy HTTP versions

5.  The HTTP Request

   To make a DNS API query a DNS API client encodes a single DNS query
   into an HTTP request using either the HTTP GET or POST method and the
   other requirements of this section.  The DNS API server defines the
   URI used by the request.  Configuration and discovery of the URI is
   done out of band from this protocol.

   When using the POST method the DNS query is included as the message
   body of the HTTP request and the Content-Type request header
   indicates the media type of the message.  POST-ed requests are
   smaller than their GET equivalents.

   When using the GET method the URI path MUST contain a query parameter
   with the name of "ct" and a value indicating the media-format used
   for the dns parameter.  The value may either be an explicit media
   type (e.g. ct=application/dns-udpwireformat&dns=...) or it may be
   empty.  An empty value indicates the default application/dns-
   udpwireformat type (e.g. ct&dns=...).

   When using the GET method the URI path MUST contain a query parameter
   with the name of "dns".  The value of the parameter is the content of
   the request potentially encoded with base64url [RFC4648].
   Specifications that define media types for use with DOH, such as DNS
   Wire Format Section 5.1 of this document, MUST indicate if the body
   parameter uses base64url encoding.

   Using the GET method is friendlier to many HTTP cache
   implementations.

   The DNS API Client SHOULD include an HTTP "Accept:" request header to
   say what type of content can be understood in response.  The client
   MUST be prepared to process "application/dns-udpwireformat"
   Section 5.1 responses but MAY process any other type it receives.

   In order to maximize cache friendliness, DNS API clients using media
   formats that include DNS ID, such as application/dns-udpwireformat,



Hoffman & McManus        Expires August 6, 2018                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


   SHOULD use a DNS ID of 0 in every DNS request.  HTTP correlates
   request and response, thus eliminating the need for the ID in a media
   type such as application/dns-udpwireformat and the use of a varying
   DNS ID can cause semantically equivalent DNS queries to be cached
   separately.

   DNS API clients can use HTTP/2 padding and compression in the same
   way that other HTTP/2 clients use (or don't use) them.

5.1.  DNS Wire Format

   The media type is "application/dns-udpwireformat".

   The body is the DNS on-the-wire format defined in [RFC1035].

   When using the GET method, the body MUST be encoded with base64url
   [RFC4648] and then placed as a name value pair in the query portion
   of the URI with name "dns".  Padding characters for base64url MUST
   NOT be included.

   When using the POST method, the body MUST NOT be encoded.

   DNS API clients using the DNS wire format MAY have one or more
   EDNS(0) extensions [RFC6891] in the request.

5.2.  Examples

   These examples use HTTP/2 style formatting from [RFC7540].

   These examples use a DNS API service located at
   https://dnsserver.example.net/dns-query to resolve the IN A records.

   The requests are represented as application/dns-udpwirefomat typed
   bodies, but the client indicates it can parse responses in either
   that format or as a hypothetical JSON-based content type.  The
   application/simpledns+json type used by this example is currently
   fictitious.

   The first example request uses GET to request www.example.com

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net
   :path = /dns-query?ct& (no space or CR)
           dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dwdleGFtcGxlA2NvbQAAAQAB
   accept = application/dns-udpwireformat, application/simpledns+json

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


   The same DNS query for www.example.com, using the POST method would
   be:

   :method = POST
   :scheme = https
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net
   :path = /dns-query
   accept = application/dns-udpwireformat, application/simpledns+json
   content-type = application/dns-udpwireformat
   content-length = 33

   <33 bytes represented by the following hex encoding>
   00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77
   07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65  03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00
   01

   Finally, a GET based query for a.62characterlabel-makes-base64url-
   distinct-from-standard-base64.example.com is shown as an example to
   emphasize that the encoding alphabet of base64url is different than
   regular base64 and that padding is omitted.

   The DNS query is 94 bytes represented by the following hex encoding

   00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 01 61 3e 36
   32 63 68 61 72 61 63 74  65 72 6c 61 62 65 6c 2d

   61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f  6d 00 00 01 00 01

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net
   :path = /dns-query?ct& (no space or CR)
           dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAAWE-NjJjaGFyYWN0ZXJsYWJl (no space or CR)

           dGFuZGFyZC1iYXNlNjQHZXhhbXBsZQNjb20AAAEAAQ
   accept = application/dns-udpwireformat, application/simpledns+json


6.  The HTTP Response

   Different response media types will provide more or less information
   from a DNS response.  For example, one response type might include
   the information from the DNS header bytes while another might omit
   it.  The amount and type of information that a media type gives is
   solely up to the format, and not defined in this protocol.

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


   At the time this is published, the response types are works in
   progress.  The only response type defined in this document is
   "application/dns-udpwireformat", but it is possible that at least one
   JSON-based response format will be defined in the future.

   The DNS response for "application/dns-udpwireformat" in Section 5.1
   MAY have one or more EDNS(0) extensions, depending on the extension
   definition of the extensions given in the DNS request.

   Each DNS request-response pair is matched to one HTTP request-
   response pair.  The responses may be processed and transported in any
   order using HTTP's multi-streaming functionality ([RFC7540]
   Section 5}).

   The Answer section of a DNS response contains one or more RRsets.
   (RRsets are defined in [RFC7719].)  According to [RFC2181], each
   resource record in an RRset is supposed to have the Time To Live
   (TTL) freshness information.  Different RRsets in the Answer section
   can have different TTLs, though it is only possible for the HTTP
   response to have a single freshness lifetime.  The HTTP response
   freshness lifetime ([RFC7234] Section 4.2) should be coordinated with
   the Resource Record bearing the smallest TTL in the Answer section of
   the response.  Specifically, the HTTP freshness lifetime SHOULD be
   set to expire at the same time any of the DNS Records reach a 0 TTL.
   The response freshness lifetime MUST NOT be greater than that
   indicated by the DNS Record with the smallest TTL in the response.

   A DNS API Client that receives a response without an explicit
   freshness lifetime MUST NOT assign that response a heuristic
   freshness ([RFC7234] Section 4.2.2.) greater than that indicated by
   the DNS Record with the smallest TTL in the response.

   A DNS API Server MUST be able to process application/dns-
   udpwireformat request messages.

   A DNS API Server SHOULD respond with HTTP status code 415
   (Unsupported Media Type) upon receiving a media type it is unable to
   process.

   This document does not change the definition of any HTTP response
   codes or otherwise proscribe their use.

6.1.  Example

   This is an example response for a query for the IN A records for
   "www.example.com" with recursion turned on.  The response bears one
   record with an address of 192.0.2.1 and a TTL of 128 seconds.

   :status = 200
   content-type = application/dns-udpwireformat
   content-length = 64
   cache-control = max-age=128

   6d 00 00 01 00 01 00 00  00 80 00 04 C0 00 02 01

7.  HTTP Integration

   This protocol MUST be used with the https scheme URI [RFC7230].

7.1.  Cache Interaction

   A DOH API Client may utilize a hierarchy of caches that include both
   HTTP and DNS specific caches.  HTTP cache entries may be bypassed
   with HTTP mechanisms such as the Cache-Control no-cache directive
   however DNS caches do not have a similar mechanism.

   A DOH response that was previously stored in an HTTP cache will
   contain the [RFC7234] Age response header indicating the elapsed time
   between when the entry was placed in the HTTP cache and the current
   DOH response.  DNS API clients should subtract this time from the DNS
   TTL if they are re-sharing the information in a non HTTP context
   (e.g. their own DNS cache) to determine the remaining time to live of
   the DNS record.

   HTTP revalidation (e.g. via If-None-Match request headers) of cached
   DNS information may be of limited value to DOH as revalidation
   provides only a bandwidth benefit and DNS transactions are normally
   latency bound.  Furthermore, the HTTP response headers that enable
   revalidation (such as "Last-Modified" and "Etag") are often fairly
   large when compared to the overall DNS response size, and have a
   variable nature that creates constant pressure on the HTTP/2
   compression dictionary [RFC7541].  Other types of DNS data, such as
   zone transfers, may be larger and benefit more from revalidation.
   DNS API servers may wish to consider whether providing these
   validation enabling response headers is worthwhile.

   The stale-while-revalidate and stale-if-error cache control
   directives may be well suited to a DOH implementation when allowed by
   server policy.  Those mechanisms allow a client, at the server's
   discretion, to reuse a cache entry that is no longer fresh under some
   extenuating circumstances defined in [RFC5861].

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


   All HTTP servers, including DNS API servers, need to consider cache
   interaction when they generate responses that are not globally valid.
   For instance, if a DNS API server customized a response based on the
   client's identity then it would not want to globally allow reuse of
   that response.  This could be accomplished through a variety of HTTP
   techniques such as a Cache-Control max-age of 0, or perhaps by the
   Vary response header.

7.2.  HTTP/2

   The minimum version of HTTP used by DOH SHOULD be HTTP/2 [RFC7540].

   The messages in classic UDP based DNS [RFC1035] are inherently
   unordered and have low overhead.  A competitive HTTP transport needs
   to support reordering, parallelism, priority, and header compression
   to achieve similar performance.  Those features were introduced to
   HTTP in HTTP/2 [RFC7540].  Earlier versions of HTTP are capable of
   conveying the semantic requirements of DOH but may result in very
   poor performance for many uses cases.

7.3.  Server Push

   Before using DOH response data for DNS resolution, the client MUST
   establish that the HTTP request URI is a trusted service for the DOH
   query.  For HTTP requests initiated by the DNS API client this trust
   is implicit in the selection of URI.  For HTTP server push ([RFC7540]
   Section 8.2) extra care must be taken to ensure that the pushed URI
   is one that the client would have directed the same query to if the
   client had initiated the request.  This specification does not extend
   DNS resolution privileges to URIs that are not recognized by the
   client as trusted DNS API servers.

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


9.  Security Considerations

   Running DNS over HTTPS relies on the security of the underlying HTTP
   transport.  Implementations utilizing HTTP/2 benefit from the TLS
   profile defined in [RFC7540] Section 9.2.

   Session level encryption has well known weaknesses with respect to
   traffic analysis which might be particularly acute when dealing with
   DNS queries.  Sections 10.6 (Compression) and 10.7 (Padding) of
   [RFC7540] provide some further advice on mitigations within an HTTP/2
   context.

   The HTTPS connection provides transport security for the interaction
   between the DNS API server and client, but does not inherently ensure
   the authenticity of DNS data.  A DNS API client may also perform full
   DNSSEC validation of answers received from a DNS API server or it may
   choose to trust answers from a particular DNS API server, much as a
   DNS client might choose to trust answers from its recursive DNS
   resolver.

   [[ From the WG charter:

   The working group will analyze the security and privacy issues that
   could arise from accessing DNS over HTTPS.  In particular, the
   working group will consider the interaction of DNS and HTTP caching.

   ]]

   A server that is acting both as a normal web server and a DNS API
   server is in a position to choose which DNS names it forces a client
   to resolve (through its web service) and also be the one to answer
   those queries (through its DNS API service).  An untrusted DNS API
   server can thus easily cause damage by poisoning a client's cache
   with names that the DNS API server chooses to poison.  A client MUST
   NOT trust a DNS API server simply because it was discovered, or
   because the client was told to trust the DNS API server by an
   untrusted party.  Instead, a client MUST only trust DNS API server
   that is configured as trustworthy.

   [[ From the WG charter:

   The working group may define mechanisms for discovery of DOH servers
   similar to existing mechanisms for discovering other DNS servers if
   the chairs determine that there is both sufficient interest and
   working group consensus.

   ]]

Internet-Draft           DNS Queries over HTTPS            February 2018


10.  Operational Considerations

   Local policy considerations and similar factors mean different DNS
   servers may provide different results to the same query: for instance
   in split DNS configurations [RFC6950].  It logically follows that the
   server which is queried can influence the end result.  Therefore a
   client's choice of DNS server may affect the responses it gets to its
   queries.

   The HTTPS channel used by this specification establishes secure two
   party communication between the DNS API Client and the DNS API
   Server.  Filtering or inspection systems that rely on unsecured
   transport of DNS will not function in a DNS over HTTPS environment.

   Many HTTPS implementations perform real time third party checks of
   the revocation status of the certificates being used by TLS.  If this
   check is done as part of the DNS API server connection procedure and
   the check itself requires DNS resolution to connect to the third
   party a deadlock can occur.  The use of an OCSP [RFC6960] server is
   one example of how this can happen.  DNS API servers SHOULD utilize
   OCSP Stapling [RFC6961] to provide the client with certificate
   revocation information that does not require contacting a third
   party.

   A DNS API client may face a similar bootstrapping problem when the
   HTTP request needs to resolve the hostname portion of the DNS URI.
   Just as the address of a traditional DNS nameserver cannot be
   originally determined from that same server, a DOH client cannot use
   its DOH server to initially resolve the server's host name into an
   address.  Alternative strategies a client might employ include making
   the initial resolution part of the configuration, IP based URIs and
   corresponding IP based certificates for HTTPS, or resolving the DNS
   API Server's hostname via traditional DNS or another DOH server while
   still authenticating the resulting connection via HTTPS.
