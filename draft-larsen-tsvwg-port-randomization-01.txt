Abstract

   Recently, awareness has been raised about a number of "blind" attacks
   that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from
   throughput-reduction to broken connections or data corruption.  These
   attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the four-
   tuple (Source Address, Destination Address, Source port, Destination
   Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.
   This document describes a simple and efficient method for random
   selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an
   attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is not a
   replacement for cryptographic methods, the described port number
   randomization algorithms provide improved security/obfuscation with
   very little effort and without any key management overhead.

1.  Introduction

   Recently, awareness has been raised about a number of "blind" attacks
   that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   [RFC0793] and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks
   range from throughput-reduction to broken connections or data
   corruption [I-D.ietf-tcpm-icmp-attacks] [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-antispoof]
   [Watson].

   All these attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the
   four-tuple (Source Address, Source port, Destination Address,
   Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to
   be attacked.

   Services are usually located at fixed, 'well-known' ports [IANA] at
   the host supplying the service (the server).  Client applications
   connecting to any such service will contact the server by specifying
   the server IP address and service port number.  The IP address and
   port number of the client are normally left unspecified by the client
   application and thus chosen automatically by the client networking
   stack.  Ports chosen automatically by the networking stack are known
   as ephemeral ports [Stevens].

   While the server IP address and well-known port and the client IP
   address may be available to the attacker, the ephemeral port of the
   client is usually unknown and must be guessed.

   This document describes a method for random selection of the client
   ephemeral port, thereby reducing the possibility of an off-path
   attacker guessing the exact value.  This is not a replacement for
   cryptographic methods such as IPsec [RFC4301] or the TCP MD5
   signature option [RFC2385].  However, the proposed algorithm provides
   improved obfuscation with very little effort and without any key
   management overhead.

   The mechanism described is a local modification that may be
   incrementally deployed, and does not violate the specifications of
   any of the transport protocols that may benefit from it [RFC0793]
   [RFC0768] [RFC2960] [RFC4340].

   Since the mechanism is an obfuscation technique, focus has been on a
   reasonable compromise between level of obfuscation and ease of
   implementation.  Thus the algorithm must be computationally
   efficient, and not require substantial data structures.

2.  Ephemeral Ports

2.1.  Traditional Ephemeral Port Range

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns the unique
   parameters and values used in protocols developed by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF), including well-known ports [IANA].
   IANA has traditionally reserved the following use of the 16-bit port
   range of TCP and UDP:

   o  The Well Known Ports, 0 through 1023.

   o  The Registered Ports, 1024 through 49151

   o  The Dynamic and/or Private Ports, 49152 through 65535

   The range for assigned ports managed by the IANA is 0-1023, with the
   remainder being registered by IANA but not assigned.

   The ephemeral port range has traditionally consisted of the 49152-
   65535 range.

2.2.  Ephemeral port selection

   As each communication instance is identified by the four-tuple {local
   IP address, local port, remote IP address, remote port}, selection
   ephemeral port numbers must result in a unique four-tuple.

   Selection of ephemeral ports such that they result in unique four-
   tuples is handled by some operating systems by having a global 'next
   ephemeral port' variable that is equal to the previously chosen
   ephemeral port + 1, i.e. the selection process is:

Internet-Draft             Port Randomization              February 2007


       next_ephemeral_port = 1024;  /*initialization, could be random */

       /* Ephemeral port selection */
       count = max_ephemeral - min_ephemeral + 1;

       do {
           port = next_ephemeral;
           if (next_ephemeral == max_ephemeral) {
               next_ephemeral = min_ephemeral;
           } else {
               next_ephemeral++;
           }

           if (four-tuple is unique)
               return port;

       } while (count > 0);

       return ERROR;

                                 Figure 1

   We will refer to this as 'Algorithm 1'.

   This algorithm works well provided that the number of connections
   (globally, across all four-tuples) that has a life-time longer than
   it takes to exhaust the total ephemeral port range is small, so that
   four-tuple collisions are rare.

   However, this method has the drawback that the 'next_ephemeral'
   variable and thus the ephemeral port range is shared between all
   connections and the next ports chosen by the client are easy to
   predict.  If an attacker operates an "innocent" server to which the
   client connects, it is easy to obtain a reference point for the
   current value of the 'next_ephemeral' variable.

3.  Randomizing the Ephemeral Ports

3.1.  Ephemeral port number range

   As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ephemeral port range has
   traditionally consisted of the 49152-65535 range.  However, it should
   also include the range 1024-49151 range.

   Since this range includes user-specific server ports, this may not
   always be possible, though.  A possible workaround for this potential
   problem would be to maintain an array of bits, in which each bit
   would correspond to each of the port numbers in the range 1024-65535.
   A bit set to 0 would indicate that the corresponding port is
   available for allocation, while a bit set to one would indicate that
   the port is reserved and therefore cannot be allocated.  Thus, before
   allocating a port number, the ephemeral port selection function would
   check this array of bits, avoiding the allocation of ports that may
   be needed for specific applications.

   Transport protocols SHOULD use the largest possible port range, since
   this improves the obfuscation provided by randomizing the ephemeral
   ports.

3.2.  Ephemeral Port Randomization Algorithms

   In order to address the security issues discussed in Section 2.2, a
   number of systems have implemented simple ephemeral port number
   randomization, as follows:

Internet-Draft             Port Randomization              February 2007


       next_ephemeral = min_ephemeral + random()
                           % (max_ephemeral - min_ephemeral + 1);

       count = max_ephemeral - min_ephemeral + 1;

       do {
           if(four-tuple is unique)
                   return next_ephemeral;

           if (next_ephemeral == max_ephemeral) {
               next_ephemeral = min_ephemeral;
           } else {
               next_ephemeral_port++;
           }

           count--;
       } while (count > 0);

       return ERROR;

                                 Figure 2

   We will refer to this algorithm as 'Algorithm 2'.

   Since the the chosen port may already be in use with identical IP
   addresses and server port, the resulting four-tuple might not be
   unique.  Therefore, multiple ports may have to be tried and verified
   against all existing connections before a port can be chosen.

   Although carefully chosen random sources and optimized four-tuple
   lookup mechanisms (e.g., optimized through hashing), will mitigate
   the cost of this verification, some systems may still not want to
   incur this unknown search time.

   Systems that may be specially susceptible to this kind of repeated
   four-tuple collisions are those that create many connections from a
   single local IP address to a single service (i.e. both IP addresses
   and server port are fixed).  Gateways such as proxy servers are an
   example of such a system.

   Since this algorithm performs a completely random port selection
   (i.e., without taking into account the port numbers previously
   chosen), it has the potential of reusing port numbers too quickly.
   Even if a given four-tuple is verified to be unique by the port
   selection algorithm, there four-tuple might still be in use at the
   remote system.  In such a scenario, the connection request would
   possible fail ([Silbersack] describes this problem in detail).
   Therefore, it is desirable to keep the port reuse frequency as low as

   possible.

   We would like to achieve the port reuse properties of Algorithm 1,
   while at the same time achieve the obfuscation properties of
   Algorithm 2.

   Ideally, we would like a 'next_ephemeral' value for each set of
   (local IP address, remote IP addresses, remote port), so that the
   port reuse frequency is the lowest possible.  Each of these
   'next_ephemeral' variables should be initialized with random values
   within the ephemeral port range and would thus separate the ephemeral
   port ranges of the connections entirely.  Since we do not want to
   maintain in memory all these 'next_ephemeral' values, we propose an
   offset function F(), that can be computed from the local IP address,
   remote IP address, remote port and a secret key.  F() will yield
   (practically) different values for each set of arguments, i.e.:


       /* Initialization code */
       next_ephemeral = 0;  /* could be random */

       /* Ephemeral port selection */
       offset = F(local_IP, remote_IP, remote_port, secret_key);
       count = max_ephemeral - min_ephemeral + 1;

       do {
           port = min_ephemeral + (next_ephemeral + offset)
                      % (max_ephemeral - min_ephemeral + 1);
           next_ephemeral++;
           count--;

           if(four-tuple is unique)
               return port;

       } while (count > 0);

       return ERROR;

                                 Figure 3

   We will refer to this algorithm as 'Algorithm 3'.

   In other words, the function F() provides a per-connection fixed
   offset of the global ephemeral port range controlled by
   'next_ephemeral'.  Both the 'offset' and 'next_ephemeral' variables
   may take any value within the storage type range since we are
   restricting the resulting port similar to that shown in Figure 2.
   This allows us to simply increment the 'next_ephemeral' variable and



Larsen & Gont            Expires August 15, 2007                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             Port Randomization              February 2007


   rely on the unsigned integer to simply wrap-around.

   The function F() should be a cryptographic hash function like MD5
   [RFC1321].  The function should use both IP addresses, the remote
   port and a secret key value to compute the offset.  The remote IP
   address is the primary separator and must be included in the offset
   calculation.  The local IP address and remote port may in some cases
   be constant and not improve the connection separation, however, they
   should also be included in the offset calculation.

   Cryptographic algorithms stronger than e.g.  MD5 should not be
   necessary, given that port randomization is simply an obfuscation
   technique.  The secret should be chosen as random as possible, see
   [RFC4086] for recommendations on choosing secrets.

   Note that on multiuser systems, the function F() could include user
   specific information, thereby providing protection not only on a host
   to host basis, but on a user to service basis.

   A tradeoff between maintaining a single global 'next_ephemeral'
   variable and maintaining 2**N 'next_ephemeral' variables (where N is
   the width of of the result of F()) could be achieved as follows.  The
   system would keep an array of, TABLE_LENGTH short integers, which
   would provide a separation of the increment of the 'next_ephemeral'
   variable.  This improvement could be incorporated into Algorithm 3 as
   follows:

       /* Initialization code */
       for(i = 0; i < TABLE_LENGTH; i++)   /* Initialization code */
           table[i] = random % 65536;


       /* Ephemeral port selection */
       offset = F(local_IP, remote_IP, remote_port, secret_key);
       index = G(offset);
       count = max_ephemeral - min_ephemeral + 1;

       do {
           port = min_ephemeral + (offset + table[index])
                      % (max_ephemeral - min_ephemeral + 1);

           table[index]++;
           count--;

             if(four-tuple is unique)
           return port;

       } while (count > 0);

       return ERROR;

                                 Figure 4

   'table[]' could be initialized with random values, as indicated by
   the initialization code in Figure 4.  G() would return a value
   between 0 and (TABLE_LENGTH-1) taking 'offset' as its input.  G()
   could, for example, perform exclusive-or (xor) operation between all
   the bytes in 'offset', or could be another cryptographic hash
   function such as that used in F().

   The array 'table[]' assures that succesive connections to the same
   end-point will use increasing ephemeral port numbers.  However,
   incrementation of the port numbers is separated into TABLE_LENGTH
   different spaces, and thus the port reuse frequency will be
   (probabilistically) lower than that of Algorithm 2.  That is, a
   connection established for a given for-tuple will not necessarily
   cause the 'next_ephemeral' variable corresponding to other four-
   tuples to be incremented.

   It is interesting to note that the size of 'table[]' does not limit
   the number of different port sequences, but rather separates the
   *increments* into TABLE_LENGTH different spaces.  The actual port
   sequence will result from adding the corresponding entry of 'table[]'
   to the variable 'offset', which actually selects the actual port
   sequence (as in Algorithm 3).

3.3.  Secret Key

   Every complex manipulation (like MD5) is no more secure than the
   input values, and in the case of ephemeral ports, the secret key.  If
   an attacker is aware of which cryptographic hash function is being
   used by the victim (which we should expect), and the attacker can
   obtain enough material (e.g. ephemeral ports chosen by the victim),
   the attacker may simply search the entire secret key space to find
   matches.

   To protect against this, the secret key should be of a reasonable
   length.  Key-lengths of 32-bits should be adequate, since a 32-bit
   secret would result in approximately 65k possible secrets if the
   attacker is able to obtain a single ephemeral port (assuming a good
   hash function).  If the attacker is able to obtain more ephemeral
   ports, key-lengths of 64-bits or more should be used.

   Another possible mechanism for protecting the secret key is to change
   it after some time.  If the host platform is capable of producing
   reasonable good random data, the secret key can be changed.

   Changing the secret will cause abrupt shifts in the chosen ephemeral
   ports, and consequently collisions may occur.  Thus the change in
   secret key should be done with consideration and could be performed
   whenever one of the following events occur:

   o  Some predefined/random time has expired.

   o  The secret has been used N times (i.e. we consider it insecure).

   o  There are few active connections (i.e., possibility of collision
      is low).

   o  There is little traffic (the performance overhead of collisions is
      tolerated).

   o  There is enough random data available to change the secret key
      (pseudo-random changes should not be done).

3.4.  Choosing Algorithm

   Algorithm 1 is the traditional ephemeral port selection algorithm
   implemented in BSD-derived systems.  It generates a global sequence
   of ephemeral port numbers, which makes it trivial for an attacker to
   predict the port number that will be used for a future transport
   protocol instance.

   Algorithm 2 has the advantage that it provides complete



Larsen & Gont            Expires August 15, 2007               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             Port Randomization              February 2007


   randomization.  However, it may increase the chances of port number
   collisions, which could lead to failure of the connection
   establishment attempts.

   Algorithm 3 provides complete separation in local and remote IP
   addresses and remote port space, and only limited separation in other
   dimensions (See Section Section 3.3), and thus scales better than
   Algorithm 2.  However, implementations should consider the
   performance impact of computing the cryptographic hash used for the
   offset.

   Algorithm 4 improves Algorithm 3, usually leading to a lower port
   reuse frequency, at the expense of more processor cycles used for
   computing G(), and additional kernel memory for storing the array
   'table[]'.

   Finally, a special case that precludes the utilization of Algorithm 3
   and Algorithm 4 should be analyzed.  There exist some applications
   that contain the following code sequence:


       s = socket();
       bind(s, IP_address, port = *);


                                 Figure 5

   This code sequence results in the selection of an ephemeral port
   number.  However, as neither the remote IP address nor the remote TCP
   port will be available to the ephemeral port selection function, the
   hash function F() used in Algorithm 3 and Algorithm 4 will not have
   all the required arguments, and thus the result of the hash function
   will be impossible to compute.

   Transport protocols implementing Algorithm 3 or Algorithm 4 should
   consider using Algorithm 2 when facing the scenario just described.
   This policy has been implemented by Linux [Linux].

4.  Security Considerations

   Randomizing ports is no replacement for cryptographic mechanisms,
   such as IPsec [RFC4301].

   An eavesdropper, which can monitor the packets that correspond to the
   connection to be attacked could learn the IP addresses and port
   numbers in use (and also sequence numbers etc.) and easily attack the
   connection.  Randomizing ports does not provide any additional
   protection against this kind of attacks.  In such situations, proper
   authentication mechanisms such as those described in [RFC4301] should
   be used.

   If the local offset function F() results in identical offsets for
   different inputs, the port-offset mechanism proposed in this document
   has no or reduced effect.

   If random numbers are used as the only source of the secret key, they
   must be chosen in accordance with the recommendations given in
   [RFC4086].

   If all ports available in the ephemeral port range are in use,
   randomization provides no obfuscation.

   If an attacker uses dynamically assigned IP addresses, the current
   ephemeral port offset (Algorithm 3 and Algorithm 4) for a given four-
   tuple can be sampled and subsequently be used to attack an innocent
   peer reusing this address.  However, this is only possible until a
   re-keying happens as described above.  Also, since ephemeral ports
   are only used on the client side (e.g. the one initiating the
   connection), both the attacker and the new peer need to act as
   servers in the scenario just described.  While servers using dynamic
   IP addresses exist, they are not very common and with an appropriate
   re-keying mechanism the effect of this attack is limited.

   The offset function was inspired by the mechanism proposed by Steven
   Bellovin in [RFC1948] for defending against TCP sequence number
   attacks.

   The authors would like to thank Alfred Hoenes and Carlos Pignataro
   for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this document.

   The authors would like to thank FreeBSD's Mike Silbersack for a very
   fruitful discussion about ephemeral port selection techniques.

Appendix A.  Survey of the algorithms in use by some popular
             implementations

A.1.  FreeBSD

   FreeBSD implements Algorithm 2. with a 'min_port' of 49152 and a
   'max_port' of 65535.  If the selected port number is in use, the next
   available port number is tried next [FreeBSD].

A.2.  Linux

   Linux implements Algorithm 3.  If the algorithm is faced with the
   corner-case scenario described in Section 3.4, Algorithm 2 is used
   instead [Linux].

A.3.  NetBSD

   NetBSD does not randomize ehemeral port numbers.  It selects
   ephemeral port numbers from the range 49152-65535, starting from port
   65535, and decreasing the port number for each ephemeral port number
   selected [NetBSD].

A.4.  OpenBSD

   OpenBSD implements Algorithm 2. with a 'min_port' of 1024 and a
   'max_port' of 49151.  If the selected port number is in use, the next
   available port number is tried next [OpenBSD].
