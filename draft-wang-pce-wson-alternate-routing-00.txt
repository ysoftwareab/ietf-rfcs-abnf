Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4655] respectively defines PCE Architectures and describes the
   routing generating mechanism when a PCC originates a LSP's routing
   request.  In Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON), PCE is a
   key way to provide routes for services.  At the same time, some PCEs
   can also have a function of realizing Wavelength Assignment(WA).  As
   a common sense, Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) is the first
   problem that WSON has to face.  Meanwhile, RWA is truly a
   Nondeterministic Polynominal-Complete(NP-C) problem.  Whatever RWA
   computation architectures (such as Combined RWA, Separate Routing and
   WA, Routing with Distributed WA, etc) are all confronted with two
   inevitable and divided procedures: route calculation, wavelength
   assignment.  In many cases, LSP signalling can not be normally runned
   by the Label Switching Routers(LSRs) in the given route that some PCE
   supplies,especially in typical WSON.  It is mainly resulted from WA
   failing in the LSRs that the service connection passes.  WA blocking
   becomes the direct reason.  (About why WA blocking occurs, please
   refer to other related drafts.)  So Alternate Routing(AR) is proposed
   for the problem of WA failings in WSON.  Alternate paths have
   appeared in RFC4655.  AR means the routing of a service request over
   a substitute route when a primary route is unavailable for immediate
   use.  When head-end node fails to establish the service according to
   the first provided route by some PCE, it can choose other routes and
   go on analysis of WA along the selected route.

   The PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP) is the communication protocol
   used between a PCC and a PCE, and may also be used between
   cooperating PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out the common protocol
   requirements for PCECP.  Additional application-specific requirements
   for PCECP are deferred to separate documents.  This document provides
   a set of application-specific PCECP requirements and protocol
   enhancements for support of AR in WSON.

3.  Background

   The WSON framework [WSON-FRAME] document defines the following RWA
   computation architectures.

   o  Combined RWA (CRWA) --- Both R and WA are performed at a single
      computational entity.  This choice assumes that computational
      entity has sufficient WSON network link/node and topology
      information to be able to compute RWA.

   o  Separate Routing and WA (SRWA) --- Separate entities perform R and
      WA.  The path(s) obtained from the routing computational entity
      must be furnished to the entity performing WA.

   o  Routing with Distributed WA (RDWA) --- R is performed at a
      computational entity while WA is performed in a distributed
      fashion across the nodes along the path.

   For the CRWA architecture, there are two possible computing entities:
   (i) the NE is the computational entity -- in this case, there is no
   separate PCE as the NE assumes PCE function; (ii) a separate PCE is
   the computational entity.

   For the SRWA architecture, there can be two variations:

   o  A separate PCE will perform only WA while the NE performs the
      route calculation based on its local knowledge.  In this case, the
      NE should furnish the route list to the PCE so that the PCE would
      be able to assign wavelength to the route.

   o  One PCE performs the R function while another PCE performs the WA
      function in a tandem fashion.  The fact that two PCEs are involved
      (one for R and the other for WA) could be invisible to the
      original PCC.

   For the RDWA architecture, the PCE is only responsible for R(i.e.,
   path computation), not for exact WA.  The exact assignment of
   wavelengths would be performed at the NEs along the path in a
   distributed fashion.  However, the PCE may limit the wavelengths that
   can be used (i.e., by specifying a wavelength set to the NEs).

5.  PCECP Extended Requirements for AR

5.1.  AR Computation Policy

   The AR computation policy represents a set of rules which defines the
   relation between PCEs and the PCCs in term of route exchanges and
   protocol interaction.

   To summarize, the AR computation policy can be defined as the
   following two types:





Wang, et al.               Expires May 1, 2009                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


   o  All the routes of one topology will be computated by PCEs in
      advance.  In this case, routes computation will not depend on
      PCCs' requests.  Periodically PCEs complete all routes computation
      of the topology which they know and save them in local caches.  At
      the same time, once the known topology is changed(such as opaque
      lsas are aged, updated, added, etc.), routes computation also
      occur in the PCEs.  And especially in CRWA's scenario, WA also can
      be previously solved in each route before PCCs' requests.  In this
      way, when a PCC's request comes, the PCE can search the suitable
      route matched with the request's constraints among the saved
      routes.  So it is good for the PCC that it does not takes the PCC
      time to wait for computating the route.  But the method of
      preprocessing routing has defects, too.  If all of saving routes
      does not meet the PCC's constraints, RWA process will fail.  So it
      is fitter for the route inquiry with loose constraints.

      By the way, in "multiple PCE path computation" case(see [RFC4655]
      ), at least one of the PCEs must have the function of assembling
      partitional routes into a complete route ahead of time.

   o  A real-time route computation will be executed by PCEs according
      to one PCC's request.  In this case, route computation will not
      occur until the PCE receives a request from some PCC.  Then the
      PCE will begin to compute the route according to the PCC's request
      including some constraints and the PCC has to wait for the PCE's
      computation.  So the time of route computation will be added to
      the PCE's reponse delay time.  In addition, the complexity of
      algorithm that the PCE uses will be considered.

5.2.  Extended PCE Request Information for AR

   In [RFC4655] 5.1.16., [draft-ietf-pce-pcep-xro-06], and [draft-ietf-
   pce-pcep-16], constraints and request information have also been
   raised.  On the basis of the list of generic information, extended
   information SHOULD be added in need of the AR case.

   The set of supported extended information SHOULD include at least the
   following:

   o  The route direction.  Used to indicate whether the alternate
      routes should satisfy the specified constraints in both forward
      and reverse directions.

      It includes two options:







Wang, et al.               Expires May 1, 2009                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


      -  Unidirection.

      -  Bidirection.

   o  Upper limit of K. Used to limit the maximum number of alternate
      routes computed by the PCE.

   o  Constraint routing inquiry strategy.

   o  Sequence Strategy of Alternate Routes.

   o  Maximum complexity of time and space about AR computation.

5.2.1.  Loose Constraints Inquiry

   Commonly constraints are thinked as strict constraints.  It means
   that AR computation MUST satisfy the constraints, else the PCE will
   repond AR computation failure.  Here, loose constraint is introduced.
   If computed alternate routes just need meet at least one of the loose
   constraints, the PCE will respond them to the PCC successfully.
   Otherwise if no loose constraint can be met, the PCE will return a
   failing response.  The loose constraints also contain Link, Node,
   Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) inclusion/exclusion.  Furthermore,
   these constraints can be combined and be arranged in priority.  For
   the loose, the higher priority of the constraint is, the earlier the
   constraint will be met.

   The loose constraints are listed in descending order of priority:

   o  Nodes includsion.

   o  Links includsion.

   o  SRLGs includsion.

   o  Nodes excludsion.

   o  Links excludsion.

   o  SRLGs excludsion.

   o  And the PCC can also combined the above constraints.

5.2.2.  Constraint Routing Inquiry Strategy

   In [RFC4657] and [RFC3209], both strict routes and loose routes are
   mentioned.  Just as RFC4657 has mentioned, routes constraints usually
   include Link, Node, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) inclusion/



Wang, et al.               Expires May 1, 2009                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


   exclusion, etc.  Now as a consrtaint inquiry prefercence, here we
   introduce the conception of constraint routing inquiry strategy and
   give the constructive definition of it.

   It includes four types:

   -  Strict constraints inquiry only.  AR computation MUST satisfy the
      constraints including all of the above-mentioned constraints.

   -  Loose constraints inquiry only.  At this moment, AR computation
      just need meet at least one of the above-mentioned constraints.
      If no constraint can be met, the PCE will return a failing
      response to the PCC.

   -  Coexistence of them.  Sometimes, Both Strict inquiry and loose
      inquiry are requested at the same time.  Then PCEs should process
      them respectivly according to the former different ways.

   -  Neither of them.  Routing inquiry is performed without any
      constraints.

5.2.3.  Sequence Strategy of Alternate Routes

   When the PCC asks alternate routes for PCEs, it is preferable to
   offer the alternate routes in a designated sequence.  In that case,
   the PCC need to supply a sequence strategy in its request.  In
   [RFC4657], the objective functions of unsynchronized and synchronized
   path computations are introduced to us.  Based on them, till now,
   there are some sequence strategies summarized in WSON as following:

   - 00  Minimum aggregate te-metrics.  It is the familiarest sequence
      type that is equal to CSPF strategy.

   - 01  Minimum hops number.  In fact, this type is deduced from the
      above.  We can look it as that the te-meteric of every hop that
      every path includes is one.  Then if the hypothesis is formed,
      that will be the above type.

   - 02  Maximum disjoint nodes as possible.  Sometimes, for the PCC's
      need, the alternate routes are sequenced under the consideration
      of nodes that routes inlcude being parted each other as possible.
      Supposing that when the PCC receives the PCE's successful response
      (Here, we consider the RDWA scenario .), it will use the first
      provided route to perform WA.  Once WA fails in the used path,
      then another alternate route will be selected.  It is more likely
      that WA succeeds using the path consisting of ultimately different
      nodes.  So important this strategy is, and the next two strategies
      are homothetic.



Wang, et al.               Expires May 1, 2009                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


   - 03  Maximum disjoint links as possible.

   - 04  Maximum disjoint SRLGs as possible.

   - 05  Highest efficient use based on bandwidth granularity.  In WSON,
      RWA processes of the sevices which in batch processing are
      initiated by the NMS will be computed at a variety of bandwidth
      granularities.  Generally speaking, there are k kinds of bandwidth
      granularities according to ODUk supported by the transport plane.
      At this time, alternate routes computed by the PCE will be
      sequenced in the residual bandwidth of the links that the every
      alternate route contains and the bandwidth granularity that the
      sevice to be set up needs.  For example, now there are three
      alternate routes for a service connection of which bandwidth
      granularity is ODU0.  And the residual bandwidth granularities in
      their contained links are ODU1 ODU2, and ODU0 respectively.  In
      this strategy, we can arrange such routes in the granularity
      order: ODU0, ODU1, ODU2.  So in this method, we can avoid the
      fragment of free bandwidth appearing as possible.

   - 06  Highest load balancing degree.  Load balancing problem has been
      cared for in AR.  To some extent, it is similar to "maximize the
      residual bandwidth on the most loaded link" in RFC4657.  Here, it
      is also used for the loaded SRLG.

5.2.4.   Maximum Complexity of Time and Space about AR Computation

   In RFC4655 "6.4.  PCE Discovery and load balancing, The PCC may learn
   PCE capabilities through static configuration, or it may discover the
   information dynamically."  Besides the PCE capabilities described in
   RFC4655, by maximum complexity of time and space about AR
   computation, the PCC can estimate the PCE's capabilities.  Once the
   time or the space for the PCC's AR computation exceeds this
   constraint, the PCE will respond AR computation failure and the PCC
   will select another appropriate PCE for its purposes under the
   control of policy.

5.3.  Response of Alternate Routes From PCEs

   In the case of AR in WSON, the PCE should return the K alternate
   routes to the PCC.

5.3.1.  Basic Information of Alternate Routes

   Basic information of alternate routes should include:






Wang, et al.               Expires May 1, 2009                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


   -  the actual number of alternate routes that the PCE computes.

   -  the algorithm's complexity of time and space.  By this
      information, the PCC can learn the capability and efficiency of
      PCE, so that it can adjust the strategy and choose the suitable
      PCE in time.

   -  the range of which the PCE is responsible for AR computation.  It
      should include the areas' IDs, the sub areas' IDs that the PCE
      deals with.

5.3.2.  Form of Alternate Routes

   The K alternate routes can be described in a serial format.
   Different routes can be distinguished by the head-end node's hop.
   And when the PCC receives the packets, it can extract every route by
   judging the head-end hops which contain the head and the end nodes'
   IDs.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


5.3.3.  Content of Each hop in Alternate Routes

   In RFC4657 "5.1.5.Path Computation Responses", the information which
   is responded by the PCE has been cared for.  But it does not be
   described in detail and does not be extended.  Especially in WSON,
   each hop of each alternate route should contain R and WA information.

   It MUST providing the following mandatory R information:

   -  Node ID.

   -  IP address of each hop's output interface.






Wang, et al.               Expires May 1, 2009                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


   -  Metric of each hop.

   -  Residual bandwidth of each hop.

   It MAY providing the following optional WA information :

   -  Free wavelength set of each hop.  It can be used for RDWA when WA
      process has not been executed.

   -  Definite used wavelength of each hop by WA analysis.  It can be
      used for CRWA when the PCE has the funciton of WA at the same
      time.

5.4.  AR Computation Strategy with Inclusion Constraints

   It is well-known that inclusion constrains, such as nodes, links,
   SRLGs, and the combined separate the route from head to end nodes
   into several segments.  In this case, AR computation will be
   performed in segment by at least one PCE .  If the numbers of
   alternate sub-routes of segments are k1, k2, k3,....kn respectivly.
   Thus the number of full routes by assembling is at most
   k1*k2*k3....*kn considering perhaps there are repeated nodes, links
   and SRLGs among the sub-routes.  The function of assembling sub-
   routes can be executed by a designated PCE.  At last, the PCE will
   respond the full alternate routes to the PCC or go on to perform the
   WA analysis by them. and pay attention to isolate nodes appear.

5.5.  The Relationship between Primary Route and Backup Route in AR

   For the purpose of Automatic Protection Switching (APS), the PCE can
   provide two kinds of routes, one is the primary route for the work
   connection and the other is the backup route for the protect
   connection.

   Between the primary and the backup routes, there are also some
   routing strategies as following:

   -  completely disjoint links;

   -  completely disjoint nodes;

   -  completely disjoint SRLGs;

   -  completely disjoint paths;

   In WSON, the RWA procedure of work and protection connections can be
   separated into two steps.  The RWA of work connection with primary
   route is the first step, and the RWA of protection connection with

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


   backup route is the second one.

   If the PCE that performs the AR computation has the function of WA at
   the same time, after the computation it will process the WA of the
   work connection using the alternate routes which belong to primary
   route at first.  After designating the terminal one from the
   alternate routes of primary route by WA procedure.  Sequentially the
   PCE will select routes from the alternate routes of back up route
   according to the above strategies.  Only these routes can be used to
   do the WA analysis of the protection connection.  After both the WA
   analyses have been completed, the PCE will return the correct results
   to the PCC.  Another scenario is that the PCE has no fucntion of WA
   except for the routing computation function.  In this case, the PCE
   should respond the alternate routes of both primary and backup routes
   to the PCC or to the other PCEs which can perform the related WA
   process.

5.6.  Re-routing of Optimization under AR

   The sequenced alternate routes that the related PCE responds will be
   saved by the PCC when the original connection is setting up.  When
   the PCC starts re-routing of optimizing, it can select the optimizing
   route from these alternate routes.  If all the alternate routes can
   not meet the optimizing strategy, the PCC will request another
   alternate routes from the PCE, that is, optimizing alternate routes
   will replace the old ones.  The optimizing strategy is the same as
   the sequence strategy of alternate routes that is introduced in "4.2.
   AR Extended Constraints".

5.7.  Re-routing of Fault Recovery under AR

   The mechanism of re-routing of fault recovery under AR is basically
   the same as of re-routing of optimization.  The difference is that in
   re-routing of fault recovery, Control Plane(CP) in WSON will detect
   the fault location and inform the PCC.  The fault type usually
   consists of link fault, node fault and SRLG fault.  And the PCC will
   add all the detected faults into the exclusion constraints of re-
   routing.  And the selected alternate routes MUST meet the added
   exclusion constraints when re-routing procedure is performed.

5.8.  Hierachical Routing in AR Computation

   In WSON, especially for AR, hierachical route is also a good
   mechanism to enhance routing efficiency.  By aggregate routes of
   inter-Autonomous System(AS), inter-area, inter-subarea and so on, the
   wholly route between the node pair that spans more than one area can
   be assembled.  Similarly, AR computation can be performed at the same
   range level.  To some extent, it is similar to the AR process of

   inclusion constraint.  The path to be set up is separated into a few
   hierarchies by the different ranges.  In the ranges of same
   hierarchy, alternate routes belonging to different ranges that have
   been obtained can be combined together by the designated PCE.  The
   whole alternate routes in the ranges of same hierarchy will be
   include the range border LSRs which the path MUST passes by.  If the
   numbers of alternate routes belonging to different ranges with same
   hierarchy are respectively k1,k2,kn, the number of whole alternate
   routes MAY be k1*k2*kn.


6.  PCECP Extended Requirements for AR

6.1.  Subobject of AR Extended Constraints

   The body format of constraint route object is mainly based on
   [RFC4874], [draft-ietf-pce-pcep-xro-06], and [draft-ietf-pce-pecp-16]
   .  Considering inclusion constraint, constraint routing inquiry
   strategy(strict or loose constraint), and priority of loose
   constraint, the format has been further improved as following.

   X

      In [draft-ietf-pce-pcep-xro-06], the X-bit indicates whether the
      contraint is mandatory or desired. 0 indicates that the resource
      specified MUST be excluded from the path computed by the PCE. 1
      indicates that the resource specified SHOULD be excluded from the
      path computed by the PCE.  That is, "MUST" means strict
      constraint, and "SHOULD" means loose constraint.  And now, X is
      extended to indicate whether the exclusion or the inclusion is
      mandatory or desired.

   Cons.  Type

      The cons. type of the subobject.  The following subobject types
      are defined.

      - 00  Exclusion constraint of primary route.

      - 01  Inclusion constraint of primary route.  When the value is 1,
         the path MUST or SHOULD include the following subobjects.

      - 02  Exclusion constraint of backup route.

      - 03  Inclusion constraint of backup route.  When the value is 1,
         the path MUST or SHOULD include the following subobjects.

   Priority

      The priority of the subobject.  When X subobject is 1, the
      subobject of priority will take effect.  It expresses the priority
      of loose constraint.  The value of priority ranges from 0 to 255
      in descending sequence.  The higher the priority is, the ealier
      the loose constraint will be met.

   Reserved

      Reserved fields within subobjects MUST be transmitted as zero and
      SHOULD be ignored on receipt.  It is used to pack allignment and
      extended in the furture.

   o  Flags (24 bits): No Flags are currently defined.

   o  Pri (Priority - 3 bits): the Priority field may be used by the
      requesting PCC to specify to the PCE the request's priority from 1
      to 7.

   o  R (Reoptimization - 1 bit): when set, the requesting PCC specifies
      that the PCReq message relates to the reoptimization of an
      existing TE LSP.

   o  B (Bi-directional - 1 bit): when set, the TE LSP is bidirectional.

      with the source IP address of the PCC and the PCE address uniquely
      identify the path computation request context.

      4 - Complexity of space about backup routes.

6.3.2.  Alternate Routes Subobjects

   In [draft-ietf-pce-pecp-16], it indicates "If the path computation
   request can be satisfied (the PCE finds a set of paths that satisfy
   the set of constraints), the set of computed paths specified by means
   of ERO objects is inserted in the PCRep message."  But for AR in
   WSON, ERO can be obtained only after WA procedure.

   So alternate routes subobjects are defined as following:

                    Hop Subobject Body Format for IPv6


7.  Manageability Considerations

   Manageability of WSON Alternate Routing (AR) with PCE must address
   the following considerations:

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 4.1, a PCECP
   implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following PCECP session
   parameters on a PCC:

   o The ability to send a WSON AR request.

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 4.1, a PCECP
   implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following PCECP session
   parameters on a PCE:

   o The support for WSON AR.

   o The attribute of used algorithm for WSON AR.

   o The support of pre-process for WSON AR.




Wang, et al.               Expires May 1, 2009                 [Page 20]

Internet-Draft       PCECP Extensions of AR for WSON        October 2008


   These parameters may be configured as default parameters for any
   PCECP session the PCECP speaker participates in, or may apply to a
   specific session with a given PCECP peer or a specific group of
   sessions with a specific group of PCECP peers.  The policy
   configuration interface is yet to be determined.  The interface may
   be purely a local matter, or it may be supported via a standardized
   interface (such as a MIB module).

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   It is expected that the operations of AR will be modeled and
   controlled through appropriate MIB modules.  The tables in the new
   MIB modules will need to reflect the relationships between entities
   and to control and report on configurable options.

   Extensions to the PCECP MIB module should be defined, so as to cover
   the WSON AR information introduced in this document.  A future
   revision of this document will list the information that should be
   added to the MIB module.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   described in [RFC4655].

7.4.  Verifying Correct Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new verification
   requirements in addition to those already listed in section 9.4 of
   [RFC4655].

7.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   The PCE Discovery mechanisms ([ISIS PCED] and [OSPF PCED]) may be
   used to advertise WSON AR path computation capabilities to PCCs.

7.6.  Impact on Network Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new network
   operation requirements in addition to those already listed in section
   9.6 of [RFC4655].


8.  Security Considerations

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models
   within GMPLS and associated protocols.  But the PCE's AR capabilities

   may wish to be kept private.  Consideration should be given to
   securing this information.


9.  IANA Considerations

   No new values are specified in this document.
