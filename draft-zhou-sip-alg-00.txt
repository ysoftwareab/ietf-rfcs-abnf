                        ALG consideration of SIP
                         draft-zhou-sip-alg-00

Abstract

   SIP protocol is widely used in IP communication applications, e.g.
   VoIP, IM.  However, the SIP communications need to do NAT traversal
   when NAT existed inside the network.  ALG can be found as one of NAT
   traversal solutions.  This document addresses the ALG solution for
   SIP NAT traversal.

Internet-Draft                   SIP ALG                      March 2010


1.  Introduction

   SIP protocol is widely used in IP communication applications, e.g.
   VoIP, IMS.  However, the SIP communications need to do NAT traversal
   when NAT existed inside the network.  Multiple NAT traversal
   solutions have been proposed to IETF, for example ICE and ALG.
   Although ICE mechanism is an advanced NAT traversal mechanism for SIP
   applications, it is impossible to know if the applications running on
   the host implement this advanced NAT traversal mechanism.  Thus, ALG
   for SIP protocol is still necessary.

   This document addresses the general ALG solution of SIP protocol for
   NAT traversal.  The scope of this document is focus on ALG located in
   IP address translator, included same IP family translation and
   different IP family translation.

3.  Outline of ALG for SIP communication

   In this section we outline the ALGs for SIP communication.

   The whole SIP communication procedure is described in section 4 of
   [RFC 3261] in details.

   There are two SIP signaling messages include IP address during the
   communication: INVITE and 200.  If the SIP communication needs to
   traverse the NAT, these two messages need to do ALG if there is no
   ICE provided.

4.  SIP ALG

   The following figure illustrates an example where SIP Phone A locates
   in a private network and uses an NAT device between the private
   network and public network.

      |SIP Phone A|--------------------|SIP Server|
      +-----------+                    +----------+
      192.168.139.100                 192.168.0.10:5060
                                            |
                                       +----------+  192.168.0.1:5060
                                       |   NAT    |
                                       +----------+  210.72.128.100:5061
                                            |
      +-----------+                    +----------+
      |SIP Phone B|--------------------|SIP Server|
      +-----------+                    +----------+
      210.72.128.200                  210.72.0.100:5060

                Figure 1 SIP architecture with NAT

   In the above figure, Phone A with UID:3100 initiates a session with
   B.

   NAT device's SIP ALG works as a SIP proxy, it behaves like SIP entity
   between the SIP servers in the private network and in the public
   network.  The SIP ALG function in the NAT device translates the
   corresponding section of SIP message and creates an SIP-ALG mapping
   table.  The SIP-ALG mapping table is used during the sip session and
   will be deleted when the session is terminated.  The SIP-ALG mapping
   table uses Call-ID as index.  The call-ID could remain unchanged or
   changed during the translation.  The SIP-ALG mapping table contains
   the following section:

   Call-ID_IN

   Call_-D_OUT

   Vias.IN

   Vias.OUT

   From.IN

   From.OUT

   The translation algorithm is as follows:

   When the SIP ALG function identifies the SIP messages that need to be
   translated, it performs the following function:

   Translate the IP address/domain name in the SIP request message into
   the SIP server's IP address that locates in the public network.

   Record the Via section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's Vias_IN entry
   and translates the proxy's private IP address and port number to its
   corresponding public IP address and port number.

   Record From section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's From_IN entry and
   translates the UE's private IP address and port number to its
   corresponding public IP address and port number.

   Record To section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's To_IN entry.

   Record Call-ID to the SIP-ALG mapping table's Call-ID_IN section and
   generates a new Call-ID and create a Call-ID_OUT entry in the mapping
   table.

   Record the Contact section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's Contact_IN
   entry and translates the UE's private IP address and port number to
   its corresponding public IP address and port number.

   Translates SDP section's o and c section's IP address into
   corresponding public IP address. m section's port number to public
   port number.  Then creates SDP_oField_IP_IN, SDP_cField_IP_IN,
   SDP_mField_port_IN entries.

   NAT devices forwards the translated SIP message to the next SIP
   server.

   Clear the timeout_Count section of the SIP-ALG mapping table.

   When translates the incoming SIP message that comes from the public
   network.  SIP-ALG function in the NAT device should first query the
   SIP-ALG mapping table using Call-ID as index to see if there is an
   mapping entry exists.  If there is a mapping entry exists, then
   translates the Via/Contact section of the SIP message and the m
   section of the SDP message using the SIP-ALG mapping table.  Then
   forward the translated SIP message to the corresponding SIP entity.

   As an example, the NAT device should create the following mapping
   information:

   Call_ID_IN 1234@192.168.139.100

   Call_ID_OUT 5678@210.72.128.100

   Vias_IN SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.0.10:5060 SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.139.100:

5.  Deployment Considerations

   SIP ALG always located in the IP address translator.

   Most SIP networks deploy SBCs to assist with NAT traversal, SIP ALG
   functionality need to be implemented inside SBC.

   If there is no SBC present during SIP communication, NAT is the right
   position to implement ALG in the network side.

   If the host based translation is provided, ALG need to be implemented
   in the host side (SIP endpoint) if there is no other advanced NAT
   traversal solution support such as ICE.
