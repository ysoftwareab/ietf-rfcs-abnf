Internet-Draft        RTP payload format for G.729X            July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) is working on a
   scalable and wideband extension of its recommendation G.729 [7].
   This future audio codec will be called G.729X in the following text.
   This document specifies the payload format for packetization of
   G.729X encoded audio signals into the real-time transport protocol
   (RTP).

   The payload format itself and the handling of variable bit rate are
   described in Section 3.  A media type registration and the details
   for the use of G.729X with SDP are given in Section 4.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT","RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2.  Background

   G.729X is mainly designed to be used as a speech codec, but it can be
   used for music at the highest bit rates.  The sampling frequency is
   16000 Hz and the frame size is 20 ms.

   This G.729-based codec produces an embedded bitstream providing an
   improved narrow band quality [300, 3400 Hz] at 12 kbps, and an
   enhanced and gracefully improving wideband quality [50, 7000 Hz] from
   14 kbps to 32 kbps, by steps of 2 kbps.  At 8 kbps it generates a
   G.729 bitstream (with annex B, that is supporting silence
   suppression).

   It has been mainly designed for packetized wideband voice
   applications (Voice over IP or ATM, Telephony over IP, private
   networks...) and particularly for those requiring scalable bandwidth,
   enhanced quality above G.729, and easy integration into existing
   infrastructures.

   G.729X is also designed to cope with other services like high quality
   audio/video conferencing, archival, messaging, etc.

   For all those applications, the scalability feature allows to tune
   the bit rate versus quality trade-off, possibly in a dynamic way
   during a session, taking into account service requirements and
   network transport constraints.

   G.729X produces frames that are said embedded because they are
   composed of embedded layers.  The first layer is called the core
   layer and is bitstream compatible with the ITU-T G.729 with annex B
   coder.  Upper layers are added while bit rate increases, to improve

   quality and enlarge audio bandwidth from narrowband to wideband.  As
   a result, a received frame can be decoded at its original bit rate or
   at any lower bit rate corresponding to lower layers which are
   embedded.  Only the core layer is mandatory to decode understandable
   speech, upper layers provide quality enhancement and wideband
   enlargement.

   G.729X supports voice activity detection (VAD) and comfort noise
   generation (CNG).  During silence periods, the coder may
   significantly decrease the transmitted bit rate by sending only
   comfort noise parameters in special small frames called silence
   insertion descriptors (SID).  The receiver's decoder will generate
   comfort noise according to the SID information.  This operation of
   sending low bit rate comfort noise parameters during silence periods
   is usually called discontinuous transmission (DTX).

3.  RTP Payload format

3.1  RTP header usage

   The format of the RTP header is specified in [2].  This payload
   format uses the fields of the header in a manner consistent with that
   specification.

   The RTP timestamp clock frequency is the same as the sampling
   frequency, that is 16 kHz.  So the timestamp unit is in samples.

   The duration of one frame is 20 ms, corresponding to 320 samples per
   frame.  Thus the timestamp is increased by 320 for each consecutive
   frame.

   The M bit should be set as specified in the applicable RTP profile,
   for example, [3].

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is
   outside the scope of the document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile under which this payload format
   is being used will assign a payload type for this codec or specify
   that the payload type is to be bound dynamically (see Section 4.2).

3.2  Payload format

3.2.1  Payload structure

   The complete payload consists of a payload header, a payload table of
   contents, and audio data representing one or more frame.  The
   following diagram shows the general format layout:

        +----------------+-------------------+-----------------+
        | Payload header | Table of contents | Speech data ... |
        +----------------+-------------------+-----------------+


3.2.2  Payload Header

   The payload header is one octet, as follows:

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |R|R|R|R|  MBS  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   R (1 bit): Reserved.  MUST be set to zero and SHOULD be ignored by
   the receiver.

   MBS (4 bits): maximum bit rate supported.  Indicates a maximum bit
   rate to the encoder at the site of the receiver of this payload.  The
   value of the MBS field is set according to the following table:

                        +-------+--------------+
                        |  MBS  | max bit rate |
                        +-------+--------------+
                        |   0   |    8 kbps    |
                        |   1   |    12 kbps   |
                        |   2   |    14 kbps   |
                        |   3   |    16 kbps   |
                        |   4   |    18 kbps   |
                        |   5   |    20 kbps   |
                        |   6   |    22 kbps   |
                        |   7   |    24 kbps   |
                        |   8   |    26 kbps   |
                        |   9   |    28 kbps   |
                        |   10  |    30 kbps   |
                        |   11  |    32 kbps   |
                        | 12-15 |  (reserved)  |
                        +-------+--------------+

   The MBS is used to tell the other party the maximum bit rate one can
   receive.  The encoder MUST follow the received MBS.  It MUST NOT send
   frames at a bit rate higher than the received MBS.  Thanks to the
   embedded property of the coding scheme, note that it can send frames
   at the MBS rate or any lower rate.  As long as it does not exceed the
   MBS, it can change its bit rate at any time without previous notice.

   The MBS value MUST be set to 11 (that is 32 kbps, the maximum) when
   there is no bit rate constraint.

   The MBS received is valid until the next MBS is received, i.e. a
   newly received MBS value overrides the previous one.

   If a payload with an invalid MBS value is received, the MBS MUST be
   ignored.

   Note that the MBS is a codec bit rate, the actual network bit rate is
   higher and depends on the overhead of the underlying protocols.

3.2.3  Table of contents

   The Table of Contents (ToC) is composed of one or more ToC entries.
   Two types of ToC are described below.  In a Standard ToC, each ToC
   entry describes one frame.  When all frames in a packet are at the
   same bit rate, the sender SHOULD use a Compact ToC, with only one ToC
   entry to describe the whole packet.  Both types of ToC MUST be
   supported by the receiver.

3.2.3.1  Standard ToC

   The standard table of contents (ToC) consists of a list of ToC
   entries.  Each ToC entry describes one frame.

   A ToC entry is one octet, as follows:

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |F|R|R|R|   FT  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   F (1 bit): Set to 1 to indicate that this ToC entry is followed by
   another one.  Set to 0 to indicate that this ToC entry is the last
   one in this payload.

   R (1 bit): Reserved.  MUST be set to zero and SHOULD be ignored by
   the receiver.

   FT (4 bits): Frame type, as per the following table:

                 |   11  |    32 kbps    |  80 octets |

                 |   14  |      SID      |  2 octets  |
                 |   15  |    NO_DATA    |      0     |
                 +-------+---------------+------------+

   The FT value 15 (NO_DATA) indicates that a frame is either lost or
   not transmitted.  For a ToC entry with FT=15, there will be no
   corresponding audio frame in the payload.  Note that packets
   containing only NO_DATA frames SHOULD NOT be transmitted.

   If a ToC entry with an invalid FT value is received, the entire
   payload MUST be discarded.

3.2.3.2  Compact ToC

   In most cases, the bit rate will not change very often, thus all
   frames in a payload are likely to be at the same bit rate.  When this
   occurs, the sender SHOULD put only one ToC entry to indicate the bit
   rate of all frames in the packet.  The receiver will easily detect
   that there is only one ToC entry (bit F=0) and that the size of the
   audio data part of the payload is a multiple of the size of one frame
   at the considered bit rate.  So the actual number of frame is easy to
   infer from the size of the audio data part:

      nb_frames = (size_of_audio_data) / (size_of_one_frame).

   This ToC simplification is compatible with DTX, with the restriction
   that the SID frame MUST be at the end of the payload (it is in
   consistent with the payload format of G.729 described in section
   4.5.6 of [3]).  Since the SID frame is much smaller than any other
   frame, it will not hinder the calculation of the number of frames at
   the receiver side and can be easily detected without the need of
   adding a Toc entry with FT=14.  Actually the presence of a SID frame

Internet-Draft        RTP payload format for G.729X            July 2005


   will be inferred by the result of the above division not being an
   integer.

   The receiver MUST support this compact ToC format.

   Note well that this simplification of the ToC is acceptable only if
   ALL frames are at the same bit rate.  It can not be used if several
   sequential frames are at the same bit rate R1 and the following group
   of frames are at another bit rate R2, because the receiver will not
   be able to determine how many frames of each bit rate there are.  If
   compact Toc is used, there MUST be only ONE ToC entry.

   Below are short examples illustrating the compact ToC and the
   calculation of the number of frames.  See Section 3.2.5.3 for a
   complete payload.

   Example 1 : one ToC entry with FT=4 and 135 octets of audio data
   following.  The receiver knows that for FT=4, a frame is 45 octets
   long.  So there is 135/45 = 3 frames in the payload.

   Example 2 : one ToC entry with FT=9 and 142 octets of audio data
   following.  The receiver knows that for FT=9, a frame is 70 octets
   long.  So there is 142/70 = 2 frames in the payload + a 2 octets rest
   which is a SID frame.

3.2.4  Audio data

   Audio data of a payload contains one or more audio frame as described
   in the table of contents of the payload.  The audio frames are packed
   in the same order as their corresponding ToC entries are arranged in
   the table of contents.  If the Compact ToC is used, the audio frames
   are packed in order of time, that is the older first.

   Note that for ToC entries with FT=15, there will be no corresponding
   audio frame in the payload.

Internet-Draft        RTP payload format for G.729X            July 2005


3.2.5.3  Payload carrying multiple frames at the same bit rate

   The following diagram shows a G.729X payload that contains 2 frames
   at 14 kbps (FT=2; size=35 octets) and a MBS of 32 kbps (MBS=11).  It
   illustrates the Compact ToC: there is only one ToC entry, the number
   of frames is inferred from the payload size.

4.  Payload format parameters

   This section defines the parameters that may be used to configure
   optional features in the G.729X RTP transmission.

   The parameters are defined here as part of the media subtype
   registration for the G.729X codec.  A mapping of the parameters into
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [4] is also provided for those
   applications that use SDP.  In control protocols that do not use MIME
   or SDP, the media type parameters must be mapped to the appropriate
   format used with that control protocol.

4.1  Media type registration

   Type name: audio

   Subtype name: G729X  [to be replaced by the actual annex letter]

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

      dtx: indicates that discontinuous transmission (DTX) is used or
      preferred.  DTX means voice activity detection and non
      transmission of silent frames.  Permissible values are 0 and 1. 0
      means no DTX. 0 is implied if this parameter is omitted.

      init-MBS: indicates an initial value of MBS.  Permissible values
      are legal values of MBS, that is between 0 and 11 (see table in
      Section 3.2.2 of RFC XXXX).  The maximum MBS, that is 11, is
      implied if this parameter is omitted.

      ptime: the recommended length of time in milliseconds represented
      by the media in a packet.  See RFC 2327 [4].

      maxptime: the maximum length of time in milliseconds which can be
      encapsulated in a packet.

   Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and contains
   binary data.

   Security considerations: See Section 5 of RFC XXXX

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: RFC XXXX

   Applications which use this media type: Audio and video conferencing
   tools.

   Additional information: none

   Person & email address to contact for further information: Aurelien
   Sollaud, aurelien.sollaud@francetelecom.com

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing, and
   hence is only defined for transfer via RTP [2].

   Author/Change controller: IETF Audio/Video Transport working group
   delegated from the IESG

4.2  Mapping to SDP parameters

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [4], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the G.729X codec, the mapping is
   as follows :

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

Internet-Draft        RTP payload format for G.729X            July 2005


   o  The media subtype ("G729X") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
      name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST be 16000 for G.729X.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the media type string as a semicolon
      separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   Some example SDP session descriptions utilizing G.729X encodings
   follow.

   Example 1: default parameters

      m=audio 53146 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 G729X/16000

   Example 2: recommended packet duration of 40 ms (=2 frames), DTX on,
   and initial MBS to 26 kbps

      m=audio 51258 RTP/AVP 99
      a=rtpmap:99 G729X/16000
      a=ptime:40
      a=fmtp:99 dtx=1; init-MBS=8

4.3  Offer-answer model considerations

   The following considerations apply when using SDP offer-answer
   procedures to negotiate the use of G.729X payload in RTP:

   o  Since G.729X is an extension of G.729, the offerer SHOULD announce
      G.729 support in its "m=audio" line, with G.729X preferred.  This
      will allow interoperability with both G.729X and G.729-only
      capable parties.

      Below is an example of such an offer:

         m=audio 55954 RTP/AVP 98 18
         a=rtpmap:98 G729X/16000
         a=rtpmap:18 G729/8000

      If the answerer supports G.729X, it will keep the payload type 98
      in its answer and the conversation will be done using G.729X.
      Else, if the answerer supports only G.729, it will leave only the
      payload type 18 in its answer and the conversation will be done
      using G.729.

   o  The "dtx" parameter concerns both sending and receiving, so both
      sides of a bi-directional session MUST use the same "dtx" value.
      If one party indicates it does not support DTX, DTX must be
      deactivated both ways.

   o  The "init-MBS" parameter is not symmetric.  Values in the offer
      and the answer are independent and take into account local
      bandwidth constraints.  Anyway, one party MUST NOT start sending
      frames at a bit rate higher than the "init-MBS" of the other
      party.

   o  The parameters "maxptime" and "ptime" will in most cases not
      affect interoperability.  The SDP offer-answer handling of the
      "ptime" parameter is described in [5].  The "maxptime" parameter
      MUST be handled in the same way.

5.  Security considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in the
   RTP specification [2] and any appropriate profile (for example, [3]).

   As this format transports encoded speech/audio, the main security
   issues include confidentiality and authentication of the speech/audio
   itself.  The payload format itself does not have any built-in
   security mechanisms.  Confidentiality of the media streams is
   achieved by encryption, therefore external mechanisms, such as SRTP
   [6], MAY be used for that purpose.  The data compression used with
   this payload format is applied end-to-end; hence encryption may be
   performed after compression with no conflict between the two
   operations.

   This payload format and the G.729X encoding do not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-end computational load and
   thus in unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the
   receipt of pathological datagrams.

6.  IANA considerations

   It is requested that one new media subtype (audio/G729X) is
   registered by IANA, see Section 4.1.
