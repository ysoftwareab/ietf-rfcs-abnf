  1. Abstract 
    
   3GPP2 is working in specifying a way to allow the mobile network 
   subscribers to configure the Firewalls in their network according to 
   their needs[3]. 
   This document defines requirements for a Firewall Configuration 
   Protocol. It has been produced by a number of 3GPP2 member companies 
   and endorsed by 3GPP2. It contains 3GPP2 requirements to a next 
   generation firewall configuration protocol. 
    
   With the number of threats that keep increasing on the Internet, 
   many networks have decided to deploy firewalls to reduce the 
   possible risks and protect their users as well as their network

   resources. Firewalls can however present many issues with new 
   protocols, applications and scenarios to be supported. Data packets 
   may be discarded at the firewalls. In addition, the clients may 
   often be the only parties that know the requirements and details of 
   the data communications. This document therefore explains why a 
   protocol allowing clients to configure firewalls would be useful, 
   and attempts to identify the requirements and features to be 
   supported by such a protocol.

4. Introduction 
    
   While the numbers of attacks keeps increasing with Denial of 
   Service, Distributed Denial of Service, virus, worms and other forms 
   of attacks, many networks are deploying firewalls to reduce the 
   threats.  
   Firewalls can however introduce several issues with new protocols, 
   applications, and scenarios to be supported. To mention few 
   examples, firewalls and Mobile IPv6 do not work well together [1]. 
   Firewalls may present issues to many features, considered important 
   parts of the Mobile IPv6 protocol, such as Route Optimization which 
   may not be used in the presence of firewalls. Most firewalls are 
   also configured to block unsolicited incoming traffic. Connections

                             January 2006 
 
 
   are typically authorized only when initiated by nodes in the network 
   protected by the firewalls. While this allows to reduce unsolicited 
   IP traffic, such configuration may compromise the use of arbitrary 
   peer to peer protocols/applications, and may prevent end points in 
   networks protected by such firewalls to host servers. 
   Different approaches have been proposed to solve theabove listed 
   problems: Application-Level-Gateways (ALGs) that by analyzing the 
   signaling messages, create and remove the necessary pinholes in the 
   firewalls, have been developed; protocols allowing Application 
   Severs (AS) to create and delete pinholes in firewalls have also 
   been specified. However, it has to be noted that often, an end point 
   is the only party that is aware of the details and requirements 
   associated with the data communications:  
    
   a) Relying on some existing network entities (e.g. ALG, AS) to 
   interpret the signaling and open the pinholes in the firewalls may 
   result in misconfiguration: the created pinholes may not correspond 
   to the incoming and outgoing traffic, and the data packets may be 
   dropped at the firewalls (e.g. an end point may establish a 
   communication using SIP&SDP and may decide to use IPsec to protect 
   the media stream. If pinholes are created based on SIP&SDP 
   signaling, the final data packets may not match the pinholes. 
   Similar problems exist if Mobile IP is used: the packets may differ 
   from the states created in the firewalls). 
    
   b) Existing network entities may not have the ability to verify the 
   validity/authenticity of the signaling. E.g. Mobile IPv6 has been 
   designed to be an end-to-end protocol. A firewall on the path may 
   not know if a Binding Update is valid or a forged one. Only the end 
   point, thanks to the Return Routability Test, and thanks to the 
   IPsec Security Association with its Home Agent can know it. A 
   firewall cannot therefore know whether the states for the Mobile 
   Node should be updated or not, upon detecting a Binding Update 
   message. 
    
   c) For P2P protocols and applications, and for scenarios where the 
   end point wants to host a server, the end point is typically the 
   only entity that knows the requirements of the pinholes to be 
   created in the firewalls.  
    
   A protocol allowing an end point to configure the firewall(s) or at 
   least indicating its requirements to the network would solve these 
   problems. Such protocol would also mitigate the risk of inaccurate 
   billing as indicated in [2], where an end point is forced to receive 
   unsolicited traffic and incur extra charges.  
   NOTE: Packets in the FW are (de)selected by matching them against a 
   set of "pinholes". A pinhole, as used in this document, is a filter 
   with values or acceptable ranges for various fields that may occur 
   in a packet.

5. Requirements 
    
   The following sections describe the requirements for such a 
   protocol. Based on different use cases, useful features are 
   identified and described. The security requirements are also 
   analyzed. 
    
5.1 Functional Requirements 
    
5.1.1 Pinholes creation  
    
   A client MUST be able to create pinholes and specify the 
   characteristics of the pinholes to be installed in the firewalls. 
    
   It MUST be possible for a client to specify pinholes containing 
   ranges of IP addresses, port numbers and SPI values. 
    
   A client MUST be able to specify pinholes that refer to encapsulated 
   headers (tunnelled packets filtering). 
    
   A client MUST be able to specify pinholes that contain at least the 
   routing options (Mobile IPv6). The protocol must be flexible enough 
   to accomodate other IPv6 options and possibly for the ones which are 
   not yet defined. 
    
   A client SHOULD be permitted to open pinholes specifying any 
   internal address associated with it. (e.g. multihoming case).  
    
   The protocol SHOULD be able to validate the source IP address.  
    
   Reasoning 
   The following describes use cases where such capabilities are 
   needed: 
    
   a) SIP-established-communications 
    
   After agreeing on the IP addresses and the ports on where to receive 
   the media stream, the node needs to open the appropriate pinholes in 
   the firewalls for the media traffic. 
    
   b) Mobile IP Home Agent 
    
   When a MN changes its location, it typically acquires a local IP 
   address (Care of Address). When that happens, several IP addresses 
   can be used by the MN for sending/receiving packets (e.g., HoA, CoA, 
   Home Agent's address), and those may take different format 
   (encapsulated, not encapsulated, etc.). If corresponding pinholes 
   are not opened, the firewall may block the packets. Similar issues 
   exist with MIPv6 signalling messages (e.g. HoTI, CoTI). Detailed 
   description can be found in [1].

                Requirements for Firewall Configuration Protocol  
                             January 2006 
 
 
   The node therefore needs to have a means to specify the required 
   pinholes (e.g. for the MIPv6 signalling, and for the incoming 
   packets from the HA) to one or more firewalls. 
    
   c) In some environments (e.g. 3GPP GPRS access) nodes possess a 
   network prefix for one of their interface, instead of one specific 
   address and may want to accept packets to a range of destination 
   addresses; or, a node behind a FW may want to accept connections for 
   a range of ports (e.g. default ones) or from a range of source 
   addresses; 
    
5.1.2 Creation of Pinholes without knowing the CN  
    
   The end point MUST be able to create pinholes with wildcard for 
   source address, port, protocol and spi values field. 
    
   Reasoning. 
   Such capabilities are useful in the following scenarios: 
    
   a) The end point should be able to open pinholes even without 
   knowing the characteristics (e.g. IP address) of its correspondent 
   nodes. This feature is needed for applications where the end point 
   does not yet know the CN: the end point may e.g. want to host a 
   server (FTP, HTTP) or run applications such as P2P (the source 
   address is wildcarded).  
    
   b) This feature is also needed for the Mobile IPv6 protocol since a 
   Mobile Node may e.g. send a Binding Update from an IP address that 
   is not known before. The MIPv6 Correspondent Node needs to open the 
   pinholes to accept such Binding Update to allow Route Optimization . 
    
5.1.3 Pinholes deletion 
    
   A client MUST be able to close any or all the pinholes it created 
   with a single protocol instance. 
    
   NOTE: a Firewall Configuration Protocol should provide a solution 
   for the above requirement in a single Firewall architecture. In a 
   multihomed scenario, with multiple Firewalls on alternative paths, 
   there should be a means for the Firewalls to keep themselves 
   synchronized.  
    
   A client MUST be able to suggest a pinhole timeout. A firewall 
   SHOULD be able to override such suggestions. 
    
   A client MUST be able to refresh all associated pinhole timeouts 
   with a single protocol instance. 
    
   NOTE: a Firewall Configuration Protocol should provide a solution 
   for the above requirement in a single Firewall architecture. In a 
   multihomed scenario, with multiple Firewalls on alternative paths,

                Requirements for Firewall Configuration Protocol  
                             January 2006 
 
 
   there should be a means for the Firewalls to keep themselves 
   synchronized. 
    
   The protocol MUST have a means to allow a trusted 3rd party to take 
   an action instead of the client. 
    
   Such capabilities are useful in the following scenario: 
   a) The end point may host a server but later, for different reasons, 
   it may decide not to host server anymore. Therefore, the end point 
   should be able to close the pinholes it opened to stop incoming 
   packets at the network, maybe even before the lifetime of the 
   pinhole expires. This is particularly important for access networks 
   with limited bandwidth.  
    
   In addition, when opening the pinholes, each of the pinholes should 
   be associated with a lifetime to ensure that no pinholes are left in 
   the firewalls in case the MNs e.g. loose coverage and get 
   disconnected from the network.  
    
5.1.4 Packet filters 
    
   The protocol MUST support specifying the action to be taken for 
   packets matching the packet filters. For each packet filter, the 
   protocol MUST be able to indicate whether packets matching the 
   filter should “PASS” or if the firewall should “DROP” them.  The 
   actions MUST be extendable.  
    
   Such capabilities are useful in the following scenarios: 
    
   a) Restricting the packets: the end point may have opened a pinhole 
   to accept packets from a specific node. However the end point may 
   not want to receive a specific type of packet from a specific node 
   (e.g. packets with specific flags on). The end point could also have 
   opened a pinhole to accept incoming requests in the case it is 
   hosting a server. The end point may however have a list of nodes it 
   does not want to receive requests from.  
    
   b) Restricting applications: some applications may be authorized by 
   default by the local network policy. The end point may however not 
   want to receive packets related to such applications and may prefer 
   to drop the corresponding packets at the firewall to avoid a wastage 
   of access network resources.  
    
   c) Blocking Overbilling attack: Allowing the end point to install 
   filters in the firewall prevents the Overbilling attacks 
    
5.1.5 States update 
    
   The client MUST be able to update the pinholes and/or packet filters 
   installed in the firewall. 
    
  
    NSIS Working Group    Expiration 07/01/06                        6 
 
                Requirements for Firewall Configuration Protocol  
                             January 2006 
 
 
   The client MUST be able to update the firewall states by providing: 
   a) the fields to be updated 
   b) the values for the fields to be updated 
    
   This capability is useful in the following scenarios: 
   a) The end point may e.g. be a Mobile IPv6 Node and may change its 
   Care of Address. As described in [1], there is the need to update 
   the states in the firewall (section 4.3), otherwise data packets 
   will be dropped at the firewalls. 
    
   b) The end point may be changing its IP address for privacy reasons 
   (RFC 3041). The end point may have installed different filters rules 
   in the firewalls and in that case, the end point also has to update 
   the states in the firewalls for the filters to become applicable to 
   the new IP address. 
    
   c) Closing the previous rules and recreating new ones for the new 
   value may unnecessarily consume network resources (e.g. access link) 
   especially if there are many rules, and introduce latency to the 
   procedure. 
    
5.1.6 Transport protocol preferences and firewall configuration 
    
   The granularity of the rules MUST allow an end point to specify the 
   TCP flags, and other transport protocol related information (e.g. 
   the end point should have the ability to specify that it does not 
   want to receive TCP SYN packets.  
    
   The protocol MUST be extendable to allow further more complex 
   actions. 
    
   The rationale is that there is an expected need to have to define 
   additional firewall mechanism in addition to setting pinholes. An 
   example is setting particular countermeasures, or specific filtering 
   mechanisms, or specific firewall modes of operation. 
    
5.1.7 Efficient use of the air interface 
    
   The protocol MUST allow an end point to create, modify or delete 
   several firewall states with one protocol instance. 
    
   NOTE: a Firewall Configuration Protocol should provide a solution 
   for the above requirement in a single Firewall architecture. In a 
   multihomed scenario, with multiple Firewalls on alternative paths, 
   there should be a means for the Firewalls to keep themselves 
   synchronized. 
    
   This capability is useful in some wireless networks, where the 
   access link resources are limited. This would reduce the overhead 
   and the delay of the procedures. 
    
  
    NSIS Working Group    Expiration 07/01/06                        7 
 
                Requirements for Firewall Configuration Protocol  
                             January 2006 
 
 
   It MUST be possible to open a pinhole with a single protocol  
   request/response pair of messages. This is required because: 
   a) a wireless link is a scarce and expensive resource 
   b) real-time applications are delay sensitive 
    
    
    
5.1.8 IP version 
    
   The protocol MUST be applicable both for IPv4 and IPv6. 
    
5.1.9 Firewall features 
    
   The protocol MUST allow the client to learn the features implemented 
   in the FW and whether those are enabled or disabled. 
    
   The protocol MUST provide a means to the client to configure the 
   Firewall (e.g. enable/disable a feature in the FW). 
   A Firewall MUST be able to authorise such request based on the NAI 
   of the client and the IP address used to send the request. 
    
   This capability is useful in the following scenarios: 
   Certain Firewalls implement different features aimed to protect 
   nodes within the network, like TCP Sequence Verifier or SYN Relay. 
   These features however, may prevent nodes in establishing end-to-end 
   communications using certain protocols (e.g. IPSec can not be used 
   with FWs implementing SYN Relay). Knowing in advance the features 
   enabled in the Firewall may help nodes choosing adequate protocols 
   and succeed with end-to-end communication. 
    
5.2 Security requirements 
    
   The firewall MUST prevent an end point to update/close firewall 
   pinholes opened by other nodes, and to modify/delete a packet filter 
   installed by other nodes (to avoid fraud). 
    
   The firewall configuration protocol MUST not open the opportunity 
   for nodes to flood a target. 
    
   The client MUST be able to integrity protect and/or encrypt the 
   messages it sends to the firewall. 
    
   A firewall MUST perform authentication and integrity check on each 
   message from a client.
