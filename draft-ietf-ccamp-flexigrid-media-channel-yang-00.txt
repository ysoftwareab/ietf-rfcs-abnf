1. Introduction

   Transport networks are evolving from current DWDM systems towards
   elastic optical networks, based on flexi-grid transmission and
   switching technologies [RFC7698]. Such technology aims at increasing
   both transport network scalability and flexibility, allowing the
   optimization of bandwidth usage.

Internet-Draft  YANG data model for Flexi-Grid media-channels  May 2018


   While [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang] focuses on flexi-grid
   objects such as nodes, transponders and links, this document presents
   a YANG model for the flexi-grid media-channel. This YANG module
   defines the whole path from a source transponder or node to the
   destination through a number of intermediate nodes in the flexi-grid
   network.

   This document identifies the flexi-grid media-channel components,
   parameters and their values, characterizes the features and the
   performances of the flexi-grid elements. An application example is
   provided towards the end of the document to better understand
   their utility.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.


3. Flexi-grid media-channel overview

   The present model defines a flexi-grid media-channel mainly
   composed of:
      - source address
      - source flexi-grid port
      - source flexi-grid transponder
      - destination address
      - destination flexi-grid port
      - destination flexi-grid transponder
      - A list of links that defines the path
      - Other optical attributes

    Each path can be a media-channel (only defined by source and
    destination node) or a network media-channel (additionally needs
    source and destination transponders). Therefore, all the attributes
    are optional to support both situations.

Internet-Draft  YANG data model for Flexi-Grid media-channels  May 2018


    This is achieved by a combination of the traffic engineering tunnel
    attributes explained in [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-yang-te] and augments
    when necessary. For instance, source address, source flexi-grid
    transponder, destination address and destination flexi-grid
    transponder attributes are directly taken from tunnel, whereas other
    attributes such as source flexi-grid port, destination flexi-grid
    port are defined, as they are specific for flexi-grid.



4. Example of use

   In order to explain how this model is used, we provide the following
   example. An optical network usually has multiple transponders,
   switches (nodes) and links between them. Figure 1 shows a simple
   topology, where two physical paths interconnect two optical
   transponders.

   After the nodes, links and transponders have been defined using
   [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang], we can configure the
   media-channel from the information we have stored in the
   flexi-grid TED, by querying which elements are available, and
   planning the resources that have to be provided on each situation.
   Note that every element in the flexi-grid TED has a reference, and
   this is the way in which they are called in the media-channel.

   1. Depending on the case, it is possible to define either the source
      and destination node ports, or the source and destination node
      and transponder. In our case, we would define a network media
      channel, with source transponder A and source node B, and
      destination transponder E and destination node C. Thus, we are
      going to follow path x.

   2. Then, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we
      are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what
      nodes are connected.

   3. Finally, the flexi-grid TED has to be updated with each element
      usage status each time a media channel is created or torn down.

   The transport protocol used for sending the managed information MUST
   support authentication and SHOULD support encryption.

   The defined data-model by itself does not create any security
   implications.

7. IANA Considerations

   The namespace used in the defined models is currently based on the
   METRO-HAUL project URI. Future versions of this document could
   register a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688], as well as in the
   YANG Module Names registry [RFC6020].
