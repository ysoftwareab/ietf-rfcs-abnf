Internet-Draft        EDNS0 Options for Private Use           April 2010


1.  Introduction

   It is common practice for IANA registries to reserve a range of
   values for private use.  These values are useful for testing new
   extensions prior to official IANA assignment as well as private
   extensions not intended for general use.

   However, [RFC2671] created an IANA registry for EDNS0 Options and did
   not reserve a range of values for private use.  Therefore because of
   these merits, this document reserves a range of EDNS0 Option values
   for private use.


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA reserve the EDNS0 Option values
   65280 through 65534 (i.e., 0xFF00 through 0xFFFE) for private use.


3.  Normative References

   [RFC2671]  Vixie, P., "Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)",
              RFC 2671, August 1999.
