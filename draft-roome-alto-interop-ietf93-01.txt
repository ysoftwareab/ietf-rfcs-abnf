             Interoperability Testing of the ALTO Protocol
                   draft-roome-alto-interop-ietf93-01

Abstract

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is
   designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network
   infrastructure to export such information to applications that need
   to choose one or more endpoints to connect to among large sets of
   logically equivalent ones.  This document defines a data set that may
   be used to test the functionality and interoperability of ALTO
   clients and servers.

1.  Overview

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is
   designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network
   infrastructure to export such information to applications that need
   to choose one or more endpoints to connect to among large sets of
   logically equivalent ones.

   This document defines procedures to test the functionality and
   interoperability of ALTO clients and servers.

   This document is informational and is NOT NORMATIVE on any aspects of
   the ALTO protocol.  The normative behavior of ALTO entities is
   prescribed in [RFC7285].

   Section 2 defines the network maps, cost maps and other data
   necessary to provision an ALTO server.  This ensures that all tested
   servers will return the same results, so a client may verify that a
   server is operating correctly.  Section 3 defines the required and
   optional resources for an ALTO server to provide.  Section 4
   describes the actions expected from a client.  Section 5 describes a
   set of invalid client requests, to verify that a server can respond
   correctly to client errors.

   While every effort has been made to catalogue representative test
   cases, this document does not attempt to codify every test case that
   arises in ALTO.  The aim of the document is to focus on areas that
   highlight the key offerings of the ALTO protocol.


2.  Server Data

   This section defines the data necessary to provision a tested ALTO
   server in a uniform manner.  First it defines a default network map,
   and associated cost maps for the "routingcost" and "hopcount"
   metrics.  Next it defines an optional alternate network map, along
   with "routingcost" and "hopcount" costs for that map.  Finally it
   defines a set of optional endpoint properties.

   The following examples are fictional and do not depict any actual
   networks or address prefixes.  Because an ALTO Network Map must cover
   all IP addresses, it is not practical to use only addresses in the
   ranges reserved for documentation [[RFC5737], [RFC3849]].

   Appendix A gives network and cost map data defined in this section
   formatted in JSON.

2.1.  Default Network Map And Cost Maps

   Every tested ALTO server MUST provide a default network map with the
   PIDs defined below:

       PID         IP Address Block
       ---------------------------------------
       mine        100.0.0.0/8

       peer1       128.0.0.0/16, 130.0.0.0/16, 2001:DB8:0000::/33
       peer2       129.0.0.0/16, 131.0.0.0/16, 2001:DB8:8000::/33

       tran1       132.0.0.0/16
       tran2       135.0.0.0/16

       default     0.0.0.0/0, ::0/0
       loopback    127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128
       linklocal   169.254.0.0/16, ff80::/10
       private     10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12,
                   192.168.0.0/16, fc00::/7

                       Figure 1: Default Network Map

   Each ALTO server MUST provide a cost map for the "routingcost"
   metric.  The following table presents the numerical values for those
   costs.  If a server provides a numerical-mode cost map, it MUST use
   these values.  If a server provides an ordinal-mode cost map, the
   server may use whatever values it wants, provided the ordinal values
   preserve the order of the numerical values.

                Figure 2: "routingcost" Numerical Cost Map

   Note that this is a partial cost map, in that it does not define a
   cost for every source and destination PID.  Also note that the costs
   are symmetric except for (mine1,mine2) and (mine1a,mine2).

   Each ALTO server MAY provide a cost map for the "hopcount" metric.
   The following table gives the numerical values.  As with
   "routingcost", a numerical-mode cost map MUST use these values, and
   an ordinal-mode cost map may use any values consistent with this
   ordering.

   The links between the routers (R1 - R11) have the following metrics.
   To get the routingcost between two PIDs, sum the link metrics for all
   paths between the PIDs, and take the lowest sum.  Be aware that the
   link between R3 and R4 is asymmetric.

   Each ALTO server MAY provide a cost map for the "routingcost" metric
   for the alternate network map.  The following table presents the
   numerical values for those costs.  If a server provides a numerical-
   mode cost map, it MUST use these values.  If a server provides an
   ordinal-mode cost map, the server may use whatever values it wants,
   provided the ordinal values preserve the order of the numerical
   values.

   Each ALTO server MAY provide a cost map for the "hopcount" metric.

2.3.  Endpoint Properties

   An ALTO server may provide the private endpoint property "priv:ietf-
   type" with the following values for endpoints in the indicated
   address blocks:

       Value       IP Address Block
       ---------------------------------------
       mine        100.0.0.0/8

         Figure 11: Values for "priv:ietf-type" endpoint property


3.  Server Resources and Configuration

   An ALTO server MUST provide the following resources, as required by
   [RFC7285]:

   o  An Information Resource Directory (IRD) which describes all of the
      server's resources.

   o  A Network Map resource for the default network defined above.

   o  A Cost Map resource for the "routingcost" metric for the default
      network map.  The mode may be either "numerical" or "ordinal".  If
      "numerical", the values MUST be identical to those defined above.
      If "ordinal", the server can use whatever values it wants, but the
      ordering MUST be consistent with the ordering of the "numerical"
      values.



Roome, et al.            Expires March 12, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                ALTO Interop                September 2015


   o  An Endpoint Property Service for the "pid" property for the
      default network map.

   A server MAY provide whatever additional resources it desires, as
   long as they are consistent with the network maps, cost maps and
   endpoint properties defined in Section 2.  In particular, a server
   may provide:

   o  An additional Network Map resource, using the PIDs and address
      prefixes for the alternate network map defined above.

   o  Cost Map resources for the "routingcost" and/or "hopcount"
      metrics, in either "numerical" or "ordinal" modes, using the
      values defined above.

   o  Filtered Network Map resources for either or both network maps.

   o  Filtered Cost Map resources for any combination of "routingcost"
      and "hopcount" metrics, in either "numerical" and "ordinal" modes,
      for either or both network maps.  The resources may or may not
      accept constraint tests.

   o  Endpoint Cost Service(s) or any combination of "routingcost" and
      "hopcount" metrics, in either "numerical" and "ordinal" modes.
      The cost values MUST be consistent with those for the default
      network map.  The resources may or may not accept constraint
      tests.

   o  Endpoint Property Service(s) for the custom endpoint properties
      defined above.

   However, a server MUST NOT provide more than the two network maps
   defined in this document.  This restriction simplifies testing,
   because it allows a client to automatically identify the alternate
   network map (e.g., any network map which is not the default must be
   the alternate network).  If servers could offer three or more network
   maps, a client would have to be provisioned with the resource id of
   the alternate network map.

   Note that if a server provides a Network Map resource for the
   alternate network map, [RFC7285] requires the server to also provide
   a Cost Map resource for the "routingcost" metric, in either
   "numerical" or "ordinal" mode, and an Endpoint Property Service for
   that network map's "pid" property.

   A server MAY structure the IRD however it wants.  In particular, a
   server may

   o  Use secondary IRDs which the root IRD references.

   o  Use arbitrary resource IDs and cost type names.

   o  Use arbitrary URIs, in any recognized URI format.

   o  Provide multiple versions of POST-mode resources.  For example, if
      a server provides the secondary network map, it must provide an
      Endpoint Property Service for the "pid" properties for both maps.
      A server may provide one EPS for both properties, or a separate
      EPS for each property.


4.  Client Actions

   When given the URI for an ALTO server's IRD, an ALTO client should
   read the IRD, and for each resource that it recognizes, verify that
   the server returns the correct response.  Note that most of the data
   the server returns is determined by the network maps, cost maps and
   property values specified in Section 2, and hence can be verified by
   a client.  Some data cannot be determined a priori (e.g., resource id
   and tag of a network map), but a client can verify their consistency
   (e.g., a cost map's dependent-vtag field should match the vtag field
   of the associated network map).

   Because costs are floating-point values, instead of using an exact
   equality test, clients should verify that the actual cost is within
   0.001 of the expected cost.  Also note that although the "hopcount"
   values are integers, a server may return integral-valued floating
   point numbers (e.g., 1.0 rather than 1).

   It is expected that not every client will be able recognize and
   verify every possible resource.  However, each client MUST be able to
   verify the default network map and the associated "routingcost" cost
   map.  In particular, although clients are not required to recognize
   the alternate network map, if presented with an IRD with two network
   maps, every client MUST be able to distinguish the default network
   map, and its associated cost map, from the alternate network map.

   Ideally clients should be scripted.  That is, when given the URI for
   a server, an ideal client would verify the server automatically,
   without further operator intervention.  A client should log the
   resources it tested, and clearly highlight any response the client
   considered incorrect.

   The HTTP GET-mode resources (Network Map and Cost Map) do not require
   client input, and hence testing is straight-forward: the client sends
   the appropriate HTTP GET request, and verifies the response.

   However, POST-mode resources, such as Filtered Cost Maps and Endpoint
   Property Services, require client input.  The following sections
   present recommended input parameters for various resources, and
   clients SHOULD implement as many of these tests as possible.  Clients
   MAY add additional tests, and are encouraged to do so.

4.1.  Filtered Network Map Tests

   o  Empty "pid" array, omitted or empty "address-types" array.  The
      server should return the entire network map.

   o  Empty "pids" array, "address-types" array containing just "ipv6".
      The server should return PIDs with ipv6 addresses, and only those
      PIDs.

   o  "pids" array with one or more non-existent PID names, such as
      "not-a-pid".  The server should return an empty network map.

   o  "pids" array with a set of valid PID names (client's choice), plus
      one or more non-existent PID names.  The server should return the
      valid PIDs and ignore the invalid ones.

4.2.  Filtered Cost Map Tests

   All tests require an appropriate "cost-type" parameter.  At a
   minimum, clients should run these tests for the "routingcost" metric
   for the default network map.  If possible, clients should also run
   these tests for the "hopcount" metric and the alternate network map.

   Clients should remember that when testing "ordinal" costs, any values
   are acceptable as long as they are consistent with the order of the
   "numerical" costs defined in Section 2.  Clients are also reminded
   that ordinal values are only comparable to other values in the same
   request, and a server may recalculate ordinal values for each
   request.  Hence the same cost point may have ordinal value "6" in a
   full cost map, but have value "1" in a filtered cost map.

   o  Empty "srcs" and "dsts" arrays.  The server should return the
      entire cost map.

   o  Empty "srcs" array, "dsts" array with one or more valid PIDs.  The
      server should return costs from all PIDs to the specified
      destination PIDs.

   o  Empty "dsts" array, "srcs" array with one or more valid PIDs.  The
      server should return costs from the specified source PIDs to all
      destination PIDs.

   o  "srcs" and "dsts" arrays with only non-existent PID names.  The
      server should return an empty cost map.

   o  "srcs" and "dsts" arrays with a set of valid PID names (client's
      choice), plus one or more non-existent PID names in one or the
      arrays.  The server should return costs for the valid PIDs and
      ignore the non-existent ones.

   o  The two-element constraint test "ge 20.0", "le 30.0" for the
      numerical "routingcost" for the default network map, with empty
      "srcs" and "dsts" arrays (assuming that resource allows
      constraints, of course).  The server should return the all costs
      in the range, namely:

             mine mine1 mine1a mine2 mine3 peer1 peer2
        mine    -     -      -     -     -  20.0  25.0

       mine3    -     -      -     -     -  25.0  30.0

       peer2 25.0  28.0   30.0  29.0  30.0     -     -

                 Figure 12: Filtered Cost Map Constraint Test

4.3.  Endpoint Property Service Tests

   Every client should verify that the server's EPS resource for the
   default network's "pid" property returns the correct PID name for a
   representative set of endpoint addresses.  If possible, clients
   should also verify the alternate network's "pid" property and the
   "priv:ietf-type" property.

   The table below gives the expected values for a set of addresses.
   Clients are encouraged to test other addresses as well.

4.4.  Endpoint Cost Service Tests

   If the ALTO server provides an Endpoint Cost Service (ECS), and if
   the client supports ECS queries, then the client SHOULD send
   representative ECS queries to the server.  For ECS, the server should
   use the costs associated with the default network map, so the client
   can verify the server's response.

   An ECS-aware client SHOULD send the following queries to the server,
   for the "routingcost" and/or "hopcount" metrics, as suppored by the
   server.  A client may add additional tests as desired.

4.4.1.  ECS Test 1

   This test determines the costs between various endpoints in the
   "mine*" and "peer*" PIDs:

   PID:

   Since no costs are defined between those PIDs the server MUST return
   an ECS response containing no costs.

4.4.3.  ECS Test 3

   This test determines the costs between endpoints in the "loopback"
   PID:

      Query:
        sources:

4.4.4.  ECS Test 4

   This test determines the cost when the client does not specify any
   destination addresses.  In this case, the server SHOULD use the
   client's address as the destination.  The costs, however, will depend
   on the PID for the client's address, which in turn will depend on the
   network configuration of the test environment.  But in most cases,
   the client's PID will be in either the "default" or "private" PIDs.

   This test determines the cost when the client does not specify any
   source addresses.  In this case, the server SHOULD use the client's
   address as the source.  The costs, however, will depend on the PID
   for the client's address, which in turn will depend on the network

5.  Error Tests

   A client may send various invalid requests to a server to verify that
   the server returns a reasonable response.  The following tests are
   suggested; clients may do additional tests as desired.

   Each error test is defined by

   description:
      A short description of the test.

   resource:
      The type of server resource to which this test applies.  E.g.,
      Filtered Cost Map, Endpoint Property Service, etc.

   accept:
      The "Accept" HTTP header that the client should send to the
      server, if something other than the media-type for that resource's
      response.

   content-type:
      For POST requests, the Content-Type HTTP header the client should
      send to the server.

   input:
      For POST requests, the JSON input the client should send to send
      to the server.

   http-status:
      The HTTP status code the server should return.

   code, field, value:
      The values of the corresponding fields the server should return in
      an ALTO error message (see Section 8.5.2 of [RFC7285]).

   For "property" fields in Endpoint Property Service tests, clients
   should replace the property name "default.pid" with the resource-
   specific name of the server's default network map's "pid" property.
   That is, if the resource id of the server's default network map is
   "mynet", replace "default.pid" with "mynet.pid".

5.1.  Invalid Field Type

   For an EPS request, the "endpoints" input field should be a JSON
   array of one or more addresses.  In this test, it is a scalar JSON
   string.

5.3.  Invalid Property Name

   This test requests the (presumably!) invalid property "no-such-
   property".

         field:        properties
         value:        no-such-property

5.4.  Invalid Endpoint Addresses

   These tests verify that a server rejects various invalid endpoint
   addresses.

5.5.  Invalid Cost Type

   This test requests the (presumably!) invalid cost metric "no-such-
   metric".  If the server's Filtered Cost Map resource only provides
   "ordinal" mode cost types, the client should change "numerical" mode

   to "ordinal" mode, to prevent the server from rejecting the request
   because of an invalid cost mode.

5.6.  Invalid Cost Mode

   This test requests the invalid cost mode "no-such-mode".  The client
   should direct this request to a Filtered Cost Map resource which can
   return the "routingcost" metric, to prevent the server from rejecting
   the request because of an invalid cost metric.

         resource:     Filtered Cost Map
         accept:       application/alto-costmap+json

         value:        no-such-mode

5.7.  Invalid Cost Constraints

   This test uses a constraint test with the undefined "ne" operator.
   The client should direct this request to a Filtered Cost Map resource
   which can return the "routingcost" metric in "numerical" mode, to
   prevent the server from rejecting the request because of an invalid
   cost metric or mode.

5.9.  Invalid Accept Header In GET Request

   This test attempts to GET the Full Network Map, without including the
   appropriate media-type ("application/alto-networkmap+json") in the
   "Accept" HTTP header.  Note that the client must ensure that the HTTP
   library does not automatically append "*/*" to the "Accept" header.
   Also note that because this is an HTTP error, [RFC7285] does not
   specify the content the server is expected to return.

         resource:     Full Network Map
         accept:       text/html

5.10.  Invalid Accept Header In POST Request

   This test requests a property without including the appropriate
   media-type ("application/alto-endpointprop+json") in the "Accept"
   HTTP header.  Note that the client must ensure that the HTTP library
   does not automatically append "*/*" to the "Accept" header.  Note
   that because this is an HTTP error, [RFC7285] does not specify the
   content the server is expected to return.
