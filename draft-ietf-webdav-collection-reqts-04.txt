     Abstract

        The base WebDAV protocol [WebDAV] provides basic support for
        collections.  It defines a MKCOL method for creating collections
        and specifies how other HTTP and WebDAV methods interact with
        collections.  It supports internal members of collections, which it
        defines as members whose URIs are immediately relative to the URI
        of the collection.

        This draft sets out requirements for more advanced, optional
        collection functionality. It extends the base functionality in two
        general directions: support for referential resources, and support
        for ordered collections.  A separate WebDAV specification is
        expected to define protocol elements providing the functionality
        described here.

     1  Terminology

        The terminology used here follows and extends that in the base 
        WebDAV protocol specification [WebDAV].

       Collection
          A resource that contains a set of URIs, termed member URIs, which
          identify member resources

Slein & Davis                                                   Page 1
INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV Collection Requirements       February 1999


       Member URI
          A URI which is a member of the set of URIs contained by a
          collection

       Referential Resource (or Reference)
          A resource that has no body of its own (though it does have
          properties), but rather is a reference to another resource

       Ordinary Resource
          A resource that is not a reference to another resource

       Target Resource
          The resource referenced by a referential resource

       Direct Reference
          A reference that is resolved by the server without any client
          action, giving the client the illusion that it is operating
          directly on the target resource

       Redirect Reference
          A reference that requires client action before it can be
          resolved, so that the client is aware that a reference is
          mediating between it and the target resource

       Strong Reference
          A reference whose referential integrity is enforced by the
          server

       Weak Reference
          A reference whose referential integrity is not enforced by the
          server

       Referential Integrity
          The integrity of a reference is preserved as long as it points
          to the same resource it pointed to when it was created.  Its
          integrity may be destroyed if the target resource is moved
          without updating the reference to reflect its new location, or
          if the target resource is deleted.

     2  Introduction and Rationale

        The simple collections that the base WebDAV specification supports
        are powerful enough to be widely useful.  They provide for the
        hierarchical organization of resources, with mechanisms for
        creating and deleting collections, copying and moving them,
        locking them, adding resources to them and deleting resources from
        them, and getting listings of their members.  Delete, copy, move,
        list, and lock operations can be applied recursively, so that a
        client can operate on whole hierarchies with a single request.

        Many applications, however, need more powerful collections.  There
        are two areas in particular where more powerful functionality is
        often needed: referential resources and ordering.  This draft
        details the additional functionality that is needed in these two

Slein & Davis                                                   Page 2
INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV Collection Requirements       February 1999

        areas.

     2.1  Referential Resources

        Referential resources make it possible for many collections, on the
        same or different servers, to share the same resource.  Because
        the collections share the resource by referencing it, only one
        physical copy of the resource need exist, and any changes made in
        the resource are visible from all the collections that reference
        it.

        So, for example, the mathematics department at one university can
        create a collection of information on fractals that contains the
        URIs of some local resources, but also references resources at
        several other universities.

        In another scenario, a manufacturing company develops and maintains
        its product maintenance manuals on the Web. There is a separate
        collection for each product manual.  Each manual is divided into
        sections, one section for every product component.  Since many of
        the company’s products contain some of the same components, many of
        the product maintenance manuals have sections in common.  Each
        manual may have some unique sections, whose URIs are internal
        members of its collection.  But for product components that are
        common to multiple products, the manual's collection references a
        resource in a shared library.

        Strong references and weak references are both useful in different
        contexts.  Some applications cannot tolerate broken links.
        A software development application, for example, must be able to
        rely on the integrity of references to component modules.  Such
        applications must be able to request strong references.  Other
        applications may want to reference target resources on multiple
        servers, where referential integrity cannot be enforced, and may
        be less concerned about possible broken references.  Both strong
        references and weak references should eventually be supported by
        WebDAV.

        Similarly, both redirect and direct references may be useful.
        Redirect references are simple for servers to implement, but
        require client action before they can be resolved.  Direct
        references are more difficult for servers to implement,
        particularly if target resources may be on a different server, but
        are simpler for clients to use.  A client need not be aware that a
        direct reference is mediating between it and the resource it is
        accessing.

     2.2  Ordered Collections

        For many applications, it is useful to be able to impose an
        ordering on a collection.  In the product manual application
        above, the sections of each manual may be ordered so that they can
        be printed together as a book.  A configuration management
        application might use a collection to represent a version series,
        in which case the "derives from" relationship might be represented

Slein & Davis                                                   Page 3
INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV Collection Requirements       February 1999

        as an ordering on the collection.

        A collection ordering may sometimes be based on property values.
        An example of such an ordering is one that is alphabetical by
        author’s last name, or one from most recent to oldest last-
        modified-date.  An ordering need not be based on property values,
        however.  A professor may order a collection of course readings in
        the sequence that makes sense to coordinate them with her lectures,
        where there is no property on the member resources that could be
        used to create this ordering.  This set of requirements is
        primarily concerned with orderings that are not based on property
        values.

        Another useful distinction is between server-maintained and
        client-maintained orderings.  In server-maintained orderings, the
        server enforces the semantics of the ordering by placing each
        collection member at the appropriate position in the ordering;
        clients cannot alter the ordering.  In client-maintained orderings,
        the client places each collection member in the ordering based on
        its understanding of the semantics of the ordering; the server
        does nothing to validate the client's positioning of the member
        in the ordering.  This set of requirements is concerned only with
        client-maintained orderings.

        WebDAV already provides tools that could be used for creating and
        maintaining ordered collections.  For example, using only the base
        WebDAV specification, an application could create a WebDAV property
        called "Order" on a collection resource.  The value of this
        property might be a list of the collection's member URIs.

        What the base WebDAV specification does not do is standardize a
        single way to represent orderings for collections.

        Different applications and services should be able to operate on
        the same collection without private agreements about how to manage
        and examine its order.  To make this possible, there needs to be a
        standard way to manipulate and retrieve the order of a collection,
        and a standard representation of the ordering.

        In any situation where collaborative management of a collection
        takes place, and different authoring tools or WebDAV servers might
        be used by the collaborators, standardization is important.  It is
        also important where a different tool may be used to view the
        collection from the one that was used to create it.

        So for example, two users from different organizations, using
        different authoring tools, are working together to create a
        collection.  One of the tools uses a property on the collection
        called "Order" to store an ordering of the collection.  The other
        tool uses a property called "SequenceNumber" on the resources
        identified by the collection's member URIs.  If each user adds some
        members to the collection, there will be no reliable ordering.

     3  Requirements

     3.1  Referential Resources

        Requirements 3.1.1 - 3.1.9 apply to referential resources in
        general.  Requirements 3.1.10 - 3.1.13 apply to referential 
        resources only in the context of collections.  Requirements
        3.1.14 - 3.1.15 apply only to redirect references.  Requirements
        3.1.16 - 3.1.17 apply only to direct references.  Requirements
        3.1.18 - 3.1.22 relate to strong references and enforcement of
        referential integrity.

     3.1.1  A single target resource may be referenced by multiple
            referential resources.

        This is the primary benefit that referential resources bring.
        They allow resources to be shared by multiple collections, which
        may reside on the same server as the shared resource or on other
        servers.

     3.1.2  It is possible to create a referential resource.

     3.1.3  It is possible to delete a referential resource.

        It is important to note that this is a different operation from
        deleting the reference’s target resource.  It must be possible to
        delete a reference without deleting its target.

     3.1.4  It is possible to set and retrieve the properties of a
            reference, distinct from those of its target.

        There are properties like "who created this reference" and "when 
        was this reference created", "what type of reference is this", and
        "is referential integrity maintained for this reference" that
        clearly belong to the reference, and not to its target resource,
        which may be referenced by many different referential resources.
        Clients must be able to set properties on a reference, and retrieve
        the properties of a reference.

     3.1.5  More generally, there is a way to cause any operation to be
            applied to the reference itself, rather than to its target.

        Although the more common case is for the client to use a reference
        to operate on its target resource, there will be cases where
        clients need to operate on the reference itself.  They may need
        to view the HTTP headers of the referential resource, retrieve its
        capabilities, lock it, etc.

     3.1.6  Operations on a target resource do not affect references to it
            except as needed to enforce referential integrity.

        We do not expect operations on a target to affect references to
        it.  Locking a target does not cause the references to it to be
        locked.  Modifying the properties of a target does not cause
        changes in the properties of references to it.  Etc.  

        This requirement is qualified to allow for strong references.  For

Slein & Davis                                                   Page 5
INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV Collection Requirements       February 1999

        strong references, some operations on targets must cause changes in
        the references to them.  For example, if the target of a strong 
        reference is moved, the reference must change to reflect the new
        location of the target.

     3.1.7  For any target resource, it is possible to request a list of
            the references to it.

        There are many scenarios that use this capability.  On a server
        that does not provide strong references, a client may, as a good
        citizen, want to check for references before deleting a resource.
        Some servers enforce referential integrity by blocking deletes
        for resources that have references to them.  In this case, a client
        may need to discover the references in order to delete them before
        deleting their target.

     3.1.8  A plain HTTP 1.1 browser or a non-referencing WebDAV client is
            able to use a referential resource to access its target.

        This minimal level of compatibility with older clients is needed
        to make deployment of WebDAV collection functionality feasible.
        References are a new type of resource whose main purpose is to
        allow ordinary resources to be shared by multiple collections.
        Although referencing clients may be needed to create and manipulate
        these new resources, older clients should be able to read and
        make use of the collections built using references.

     3.1.9  There is no requirement that references be acyclic.

        From a practical standpoint, servers generally cannot control what
        happens on other servers.  If a reference R on one server points to
        a target T on another server, R's server cannot prevent T from
        being changed to point back to R.  In addition, there may be
        applications where cyclic references are desirable.

     3.1.10 A listing of the members of a collection shows both its
            ordinary members and its referential members.

        A listing of collection members with Depth = 1 or Depth = infinity
        shows all URIs in the collection, whether they identify ordinary
        resources or referential resources.

     3.1.11 Multiple referential resources with the same target may have
            URIs in the same collection.

        It is often useful to allow the same resource to be referenced in
        a collection multiple times.  Typically, these are cases where the
        collection is ordered.  Consider a case where a collection
        represents a book, with one member URI for each page in the
        book.  A particular graphic needs to appear in several places in
        the book, and so its URI needs to appear in the collection several
        times.

     3.1.12 A single collection may contain both the URI of a reference and
            the URI of its target resource.

Slein & Davis                                                   Page 6
INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV Collection Requirements       February 1999


        In the example just described, the collection might contain the URI
        of the graphic, and also the URIs of several references to the
        graphic, so that the graphic can appear multiple times in the book.

     3.1.13 For any target resource, it is possible to discover what
            collections reference it.

        Though generally useful, this capability is especially critical
        for Document Management Systems that populate collections entirely
        via references.  Users of these systems may wish to see what
        collections a particular resource belongs to, and to be able to
        navigate to any of those collections.

     3.1.14 For any redirect reference, it is possible to obtain
            the URI of its target resource.

        This follows from the definition of a redirect reference, which is
        not resolved automatically.  The reference must give the client
        access to the URI of the target resource in order for the client to
        redirect its request to the target resource.

     3.1.15 For any resource, it is possible to discover whether it is a
            redirect reference.

        Since operations on redirect references are not passed through to
        their targets automatically, it is important for clients to be able
        to discover which resources are redirect references.  Then the
        client can resolve the references in order to perform operations on
        their targets.

     3.1.16 Operations on a direct reference, except for those that alter
            the membership of the collection that contains it, are
            automatically applied to its target resource.

        The purpose of direct references is to simplify operations for
        clients by hiding from them the fact that a reference is mediating
        between their requests and the target resource.  To achieve this
        purpose, most operations must be passed through to the target
        resource automatically.

        However, operations that alter collection membership should not be
        passed through to the target.  Examples of these operations are
        delete and move operations.  The purpose of references is to allow
        collections to include resources that exist elsewhere.  Deleting or
        moving a reference's URI from a collection should affect only
        that collection, not any other collection of which the target
        resource is a member, either internally or by reference.

     3.1.17 For any resource, it is possible to discover whether it is a
            direct reference.

        Since the behavior of direct references is different from
        the behavior of redirect references, it is important for clients
        to be able to discover whether they are operating on a direct

Slein & Davis                                                   Page 7
INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV Collection Requirements       February 1999

        reference. 

     3.1.18 It is possible to request creation of a referential resource
            for which the server will enforce referential integrity.

        For some applications, broken references are unacceptable.  
        Breakage may be unavoidable when a target resource resides on a 
        different server from the referential resource that references it.
        Servers can, however, maintain the integrity of referential 
        resources when they receive MOVE or DELETE requests for target 
        resources under their own control.  For applications that require
        referential integrity, it must be possible to specify in a
        request for creation of a referential resource that its integrity
        be enforced.  A referential resource whose integrity is
        enforced by the server is called a strong reference.

     3.1.19 It is possible when creating a reference to request that the
            server not enforce referential integrity for that reference.

        In some circumstances users may want to be able to create
        dangling references.  For example, an administrator may want to
        populate a directory with references before their target resources
        have been created.  When updating a site, he may want to remove
        target resources for a short period without having to destroy and
        recreate all the references to them.

     3.1.20 These requirements are silent as to what policy should be used
            to enforce referential integrity.

        A server enforces the integrity of a reference if it ensures that
        the reference will not be broken, or enables the reference's owner
        to ensure that the reference will not be broken.

        There are many policies that could be adopted to fulfill this
        commitment.  For example, a server could refuse to allow a target
        to be deleted while there are strong references to the target.
        Alternatively, the server could delete the strong references along
        with the target.  Alternatively, the server could flag the strong
        references "Target Deleted" when it deletes the target.  Or the
        server could notify the owners of all strong references when it
        deletes a target, allowing the owners to take whatever action they
        wish.  These requirements say nothing about what policy should be
        used to enforce referential integrity.

     3.1.21 It is possible to discover whether a referential resource is a 
            strong reference or a weak reference.

        Knowing whether a referential resource is strong or weak allows a
        client to intelligently choose its own strategy for working with
        referential resources.  For example, if a client does not know
        whether a particular reference is strong or weak, it may choose to
        recreate that referential resource to be sure of referential
        integrity; but if it knows that the reference is strong, it will
        not bother to do this.


Slein & Davis                                                   Page 8
INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV Collection Requirements       February 1999

     3.1.22 It is possible to discover whether a resource is the target of
            a strong reference.

        This requirement insures that both ends of a referential integrity
        relationship have the same information available.

     3.2  Ordered Collections

     3.2.1  Ordering is sufficiently standardized that different 
            applications and servers can operate on the same ordering 
            without private agreements.

        Applications and servers can apply an ordering to a collection’s 
        members or discover the ordering of a collection's members without
        private agreements.  They can also modify an ordering, at least
        with the help of a human user for semantics (See 3.2.3), without
        private agreements.

        This is the minimum that is needed to support collaborative
        management of an ordered collection, where different authoring
        tools might be used by the collaborators.  It is also what allows
        a different tool to be used to view the collection from the one
        that was used to create it.  Finally, it is needed in order for
        servers to list collection members in order, as required by 3.2.6.

     3.2.2  A collection is not required to be ordered.

        A WebDAV server may support collections without supporting ordered
        collections.  Even if the server supports ordered collections, 
        there is no requirement that every collection on that server be
        ordered.  Since these requirements concern only client-maintained
        orderings, clients will decide whether any given collection is
        ordered.

        The remaining requirements apply only to collections that are
        ordered.

     3.2.3  The semantics of an ordering are discoverable.

        The semantics of an ordering is the principle or rule according to
        which the collection members are ordered.  This principle must be
        discoverable if someone (or some application) other than the one
        that created a collection is to be able to add a member to it and
        determine where it makes sense to position the new member in the
        collection's ordering.

        In some cases it may be possible for the semantics to be expressed
        in a machine-usable way, so that an application could automatically
        position a new member in the ordering.  In other cases the 
        semantics may require a human user to apply them.  In either case
        they should be discoverable.

     3.2.4  Each collection member appears in the ordering exactly once.

        It would be possible to support orderings that contain only a

        subset of the collection members, or orderings that can contain
        a single collection member more than once.  It is not necessary,
        however, since the same result can be achieved by creating a
        new collection with exactly the desired members, and including
        each member of the new collection in its ordering exactly once.

        This requirement implies that the server will check, whenever a
        member is added to an ordering, to make sure that it is not already
        in the ordering.  It also implies that either the protocol itself
        or the server will insure that whenever a new member is added to
        a collection, it is also added to the collection ordering.

     3.2.5  An ordering does not include any resources that are not members
            of the collection.

        The server must insure that when a member is removed from a 
        collection, it is also removed from the collection's ordering.

     3.2.6  When a client requests a listing of the members of a
            collection, this listing is returned in the order specified by
            the collection.

        This requirement frees clients from the burden of applying the
        ordering to the member listing.

     3.2.7  It is possible to order the members of a collection in a
            client-specified way, not necessarily based on property values.

        Orderings that are based on property values can be obtained by a
        search protocol that supports sorted result sets.  This set of
        requirements is not concerned with such orderings.  It is intended
        primarily to support orderings that cannot be obtained by sorting
        on property values.

        A property is not always available that can serve as the basis for
        a desired ordering.  For example, a professor may wish to order a 
        collection of course readings in the sequence that coordinates the
        readings with her lectures.  But the properties of resources at the
        Web site are standardized and do not include one that is
        appropriate to use for this purpose.

        Even if the professor in the example could create a 
        "sequencenumber" property to use in sorting the collection, this
        strategy would be undesirable unless she knew she would not be
        adding any readings or changing the order of her lectures once the
        values of sequencenumber were set.  Inserting a new reading into
        the sequence would require updating the sequencenumber property of
        each reading that comes after the new one in the sequence.  Ordered
        collections are intended to support this sort of case, where
        sorting based on a property value is impossible or inefficient.

     3.2.8  A single ordering may contain both ordinary and referential
            resources. 

        The professor in the previous example may store some readings as

        internal members of the collection, but reference others from
        servers at another university.  Nevertheless, all the readings
        need to be included in the ordering for her students’ use.
