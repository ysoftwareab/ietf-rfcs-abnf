Abstract

   We consider the unique local address autoconfiguration problem for
   stand-alone ad hoc networks (MANETs).  Specifically, we consider two
   cases.  First, a node without a pre-assigned and valid local address
   acquires a new local address and becomes a member of a new or

   existing MANET.  Second, two or more MANETs merge.  In the first
   case, a mechanism of IP address generation based on a stateful or
   stateless method is needed.  We also should have MANET-wide duplicate
   address detection (MANET-DAD) on newly generated address (tentative
   address) for suppressing occurrence of duplicate addresses regardless
   of whether stateful or stateless method is employed for address
   generation (pre-service MANET-DAD).  In the second case, duplicate
   address may occur as the result of a merger of two formerly
   independent networks.  We should have MANET-DAD on addresses in use
   for resolving duplicate addresses and suppressing routing information
   contamination due to existence of duplicate addresses (in-service
   MANET-DAD).  To realize pre-service MANET-DAD and in-service MANET-
   DAD, we define autoconfiguration states that are common for both
   proactive and reactive routing protocol.  Each node exists in one of
   the autoconfiguration states at any time.  The specific MANET-DAD
   algorithm is beyond the scope of this document.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses autoconfiguration of unique local (MANET-
   local) address for stand-alone MANET.  Autoconfiguration methods are
   generally classified into stateless and stateful methods.
   Conventional statefull and stateless autoconfiguration methods cannot
   be used for stand-alone mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), since such
   networks do not depend on a central server and multihop communication
   is involved.  A number of autoconfiguration solutions to prevent
   address conflict have been proposed for stand-alone MANETs
   [1],[7]-[22].  Some of these proposals discuss MANET-wide duplicated
   address detection (MANET-DAD) only in initial address generation and
   do not discuss potential occurrence of address conflict when network
   mergers occur.  Some of these proposals discuss MANET-DAD to deal
   with address conflict in case of a merger.  The aim of this document
   is not to provide another solution for the MANET autoconfiguration
   problem, but to give a common framework, that may be useful for
   designing solutions regardless of wether the underlying routing
   protocol is proactive or reactive.  The baselines of this framework
   are as follows:

      - Each node should perform MANET-DAD both before and after
      assignment of a valid address in a MANET.  This is termed "pre-
      service MANET-DAD" and "in-service MANET-DAD" respectively.

      - MANET-DAD functions could be embedded in routing control
      messages regardless of pre-service MANET-DAD or in-service MANET-
      DAD.

   With regard to the first baseline above, pre-service MANET-DAD is
   useful to suppress occurrences of an address conflict regardless of
   whether stateless or stateful address assignment methods are employed
   and in-service MANET-DAD is useful to suppress occurrences of address
   conflict and the resulting possible routing information contamination
   in case of network mergers.  To realize pre-service and in-service
   MANET-DAD systematically, we use the concept of autoconfiguration
   states.  This was first proposed in [7] and is extended in this
   document.  The second baseline is useful to reduce pre-service MANET-
   DAD and in-service MANET-DAD overhead and to allow inter-working
   between nodes in pre-service MANET-DAD and those in in-service MANET-
   DAD when they coexist.It is also useful to suppress routing
   infomation contamination.  A pioneering example of pre-service MANET-
   DAD for a reactive routing protocols was proposed in [8].  A
   pioneering example of in-service MANET-DAD for both proactive and
   reactive routing protocols was proposed in [1].  These useful but
   individual schemes can be systematically included as the elements in
   the proposed framework.  A functionality and mechanism of "Duplicate
   address detection(DAD)" for link-local address are defined in the

   traditional IETF terms-RFC(2461/2462) [3] and [4].  The mechanisms
   defined in this document, i.e., "pre-service MANET-DAD" is identical
   in functionality (but not mechanism) to DAD, and "in-service MANET-
   DAD" is similar to functionality(but not mechanism),that is used in
   [6], necessary for MANETs.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  General

   This section provides definitions for terms that have a specific
   meaning to the protocol specified in this document and that are used
   throughout the text.  Some fundamental definitions are taken from
   [3], [4].

   IP - Internet Protocol Version 4 or 6.

   node - a device that implements IP.

   link - a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
      communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below
      IP.

   interface - a node's attachment to a link.

   neighbors - nodes attached to the same link.

   address - an IP-layer identifier for an interface.

   MANET-local address - a unique-local address having scope that is
      limited to the MANET.

   tentative address - an address whose uniqueness in a MANET is being
      verified, prior to its assignment to an interface.  A tentative
      address is not considered assigned to an interface in the usual
      sense.  An interface discards received packets addressed to a
      tentative address, but accepts routing control packets related to
      MANET-wide Duplicate Address Detection for the tentative address.

   address generation - Adress generation is a procedure for a node,
      that has currently no address, to obtain a tentative address in
      the MANET -either of its own accord or with support of other
      nodes.

   address conflict - When two nodes in the same MANET network share the
      same address or tentative address, the situation is described as
      an "Address Conflict".  The nodes involved are "conflicting nodes"
      and their shared address is called the "conflicting address".

   MANET-wide Duplicate Address Detection (MANET-DAD) - MANET-wide
      Duplicate address detection is the action of detecting address
      conflict in the MANET, the situation where some nodes are going to
      use or using the same address in the same MANET network.

Internet-Draft                  Framework                  February 2006


   pre-service MANET-DAD - Pre-service MANET-DAD is the procedure to
      verify that a tentative address is out of address conflict with
      other MANET nodes.

   in-service MANET-DAD - In-service MANET-DAD is the procedure to
      continuously verify that a used address is out of address conflict
      with other MANET nodes.

   autoconfiguration state - The current autoconfiguration state of the
      node, one of NO_ADDRESS, ADVERTISING and NORMAL, which indicates
      what messages it should (or should not) generate and what
      processing it should (or should not) do.

   familiar address (Node) - An address is familiar to a node, if the
      node has seen it in control messages for a sufficiently long
      period of time.  A node recognizes the other node with a familiar
      address as the familiar node.  An address or a node which is not
      familiar is denoted "unfamiliar".

   routing information contamination - Erroneous updates of routing
      information due to address conflict.

2.2.  Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].

3.  Overview

   We consider the MANET-local address autoconfiguration problem for
   stand-alone MANETs.  Specifically, we consider two cases.

      - In the first case, a node without a pre-assigned address
      acquires an address and becomes a member of a new or existing
      MANET.

      - In the second case, two or more MANETs merge.

   For the first case, a mechanism of address generation is needed, and
   a number of address generation methods have been proposed in
   literature.  These are classified into stateful and stateless
   methods.  In this case, a node first obtains an address (tentative
   address) using a proper address generation method, - be that either a
   stateful or stateless method.  It then verifies that the tentative
   address is not part of an address conflict with (not currently used
   by) other nodes.  This procedure is termed "pre-service MANET-DAD" in
   this document.  We SHOULD have pre-service MANET-DAD on a tentative
   address for suppressing occurrence of duplicate addresses in the
   address assignment regardless of whether stateful or stateless
   methods is employed.  Note that the necessity of pre-service MANET-
   DAD for MANETs with reactive routing protocol has been well known [8]
   and this method can be applied to MANETs with proactive routing
   protocol.  In this case, however, existing nodes in the MANET must
   process control messages, specific for pre-service DAD, in addition
   to those for routing, giving rise to additional overhead.  A new pre-
   service DAD method embeded in routing control messages for MANETs
   with proactive routing protocol was proposed recently [7].

   In the second case, two or more already configured MANETs merge
   resulting address conflict.  To cope with this situation, a node in
   an existing MANET SHOULD continuously verify possible address
   conflict with other MANET nodes.  This procedure is termed "in-
   service MANET-DAD" in this document.  "Weak DAD" [14] and "passive
   DAD" [1] are examples of in-service MANET-DAD.  When an address
   conflict is detected, a node with a duplicate address MUST obtain a
   new address to resolve the address conflict.  This is accomplished
   using the address generation mentioned before.  During duplicate
   address detection and resolution in the above case, some nodes may
   share the same address transiently and, therefore, routing
   information may not be correctly maintained.  Specifically, a route
   entry may erroneously be updated based on control messages including
   information from different nodes with the same duplicate address.  We
   call this problem "routing information contamination".  We SHOULD
   have in-service MANET-DAD for detecting duplicate addresses as well
   as for suppressing routing contamination due to existence of

   duplicate addresses.  To systematically realize pre-service MANET-DAD
   and in-service MANET-DAD, we define autoconfiguration states that are
   common for both proactive and reactive routing protocols.  Each node
   is in one of the autoconfiguration states at any time.  Specific pre-
   service and in-service MANET-DAD algorithms are beyond the scope of
   this document.

4.  Autoconfiguration states

   A set of autoconfiguration states are defined, that are common for
   both reactive and proactive routing protocols, in order to realize
   pre-service MANET-DAD and in-service MANET-DAD.  Each node has an
   "autoconfiguration state" at any time.  This state is an indicator of
   how long the node has been in the network.  The central idea is that
   each time a node generates a new address(tentative address), it
   should enter the network gradually, running a restrained version of
   the routing protocol.  This way, the node can detect which addresses
   are being used, checking for duplicates of its own tentative address,
   while avoiding disrupting the routing information of the other nodes
   in the MANET in the event that its address is actually found to be in
   conflict.  To do this, we need autoconfiguration states

4.1.  Autoconfiguration states

   There are exactly 3 autoconfiguration states, which define the
   behavior of the node as follows:

   NO_ADDRESS_STATE : In this state a node does not have its own
      address, and it MUST NOT process and forward routing control
      messages generated by other nodes.  It MUST NOT participate in
      data forwarding.  It MAY generate a tentative address by means of
      a pre-determined address generation method.  When it generates its
      tentative address, it enters the ADVERTISING_STATE.

   ADVERTISING_STATE - In this state, a node MUST NOT forward routing
      control messages generated by other nodes.  It MUST NOT
      participate in data forwarding.  It SHOULD perform pre-service
      MANET-DAD using the control messages,that can be embeded in the
      routing control messages to avoide introducing additional control
      messages.  Specific pre-service MANET-DAD methods are beyond the
      scope of this document.  To distinguish between normal routing
      control messages and those of autoconfiguration, a flag in the
      control message MAY be used to represent autoconfiguration state.
      For example, 0/1 in a routing control message indicates that the
      originating node is in NORMAL_STATE /ADVERTISING_STATE,
      respectively.  When the node detects that it has an address
      conflict with other nodes, it MUST re-enter NO_ADDRESS_STATE.
      When pre-service MANET-DAD is completed using, ex, timer, in
      ADVERTISING_STATE without an address conflict being detected, the
      node enters the NORMAL_STATE.  ADVERTISING STATES may have
      substates with regard to the scope of adverting, such as
      LOCAL_AD_state and GLOBAL_AD_state.

Internet-Draft                  Framework                  February 2006


   NORMAL_STATE : In this state, the node is running the "normal"
      routing protocol without message processing/generation
      restrictions associated to the state.  More precisely, the node
      generates routing control messages as usual.  It processes routing
      control messages generated by other nodes and forwards these as
      specified by the routing protocol.  It also participates in data
      forwarding.  Only nodes in NORMAL_STATE are selected as the
      intermediary nodes (forwarders).  A node in this state SHOULD
      perform in-service MANET-DAD using the control messages that can
      be embeded in the routing control messages.  Specific in-service
      MANET-DAD method is beyond the scope of this document.  When the
      node detects that it has an address conflict with other nodes, it
      MUST return the NO_ADDRESS_STATE.

   The behavior in each state is summarized in Table I and the state
   transition diagram is given in Fig.1

5.  Effect of autoconfiguration states

   Pre-service MANET-DAD is performed when a node is in the
   ADVERTISING_STATE.  Pre-service MANET-DAD is effective at reducing
   potential address conflicts and the resulting routing table
   contamination when a new node joins a MANET.  This state is, however,
   not only effective for enabling pre-service MANET-DAD.  When a node
   is in ADVERTISING_STATE, other nodes in the MANET have a chance to
   learn information about the node, such as address and sequence
   number.  Specifically, we assume that each node continuously collects
   information about other nodes, regardless of their states.  As a
   result, each node is "familiar" with other nodes in NORMAL_STATE
   within the connected MANET.  When network merger occurs, a node may
   find unfamiliar nodes, allowing it to detect the network merger.
   Thus, network merger of multiple different MANETs can be detected
   without a sophisticated network merger detection method such as based
   on network ID as proposed in the literature [10].  This learning
   mechanism may be useful for easing the design of an in-service MANET-
   DAD algorithm.  Specific in-service MANET-DAD algorithms are beyond
   the scope of this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document presents only framwork of autoconfiguration for stand-
   alone MANETs and does therefore not specify any special security
   measure.  However, introduction of autoconfiguration states may be
   useful to realize some security measures.  For example, node
   authentification may be done during the ADVERTISING_STATE.
