                    Flow split in Metro Area Network
                   draft-aoch-nvo3-flow-split-00.txt

Abstract

   In the future, there will be some new application appeared known as
   4K/8K high quality video or VR/AR application.These application needs
   high bandwidth and low lantacy.In order to meet these requirements,
   the flow model of traditional MAN should be changed.  This article
   describes a new device using in MAN to support spliting DC's and
   Internet's flow, support to build edge DC in MAN and change MAN flow
   model from pipe type to umbrella type.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a type of device using in Metro Network to
   distribute the user's flows,and forward them to different direction
   of MAN.  Service Provider can use this device to separate the
   valuable flow from Internet flow,and redirect the flow to the edge
   cloude.such as 4K/8K video or AR/VR application.

2.  Terminology

   FSD(Flow Split Device): device to split user flow according to the
   control flow table, include forwarding plane and stack module.

3.  Device model

   FSD equipment's model is described as below.

   The forwarding plane is the datapath of the FSD.  Before it working
   ,its forwarding table will be configurated by the SDN controller with
   NATCONF or OFPCONFIG protocol.

   User's data flow is sended to the forwarding plane.  In normal
   condition, the flow will be forwarded according to the preconfig
   table in the forwarding plane.

4.  Functionality

4.1.  Forward and shunt

   Forward and shunt For Internet flow,the packet will be forwarded by
   FSD according to pre configuration flow table.  The capacity of flow
   table is a big problem to the shunt device if using MAC address
   forwarding.  In a large Metro network the number of the items of flow
   table maybe up to one million, so the C/S VLAN(QinQ) forwarding
   function will be considered to reducing the capacity of the flow
   table.

   For local flow,which is disposed in the edge cloud, should be shunted
   in the FSD according to the dynamical flow table.  The protocol such
   as openflow should be supported to create the dynamical forwarding
   flow table.

4.2.  Interface

   VxLAN tunnel should be supported in the uplink of the FSD to the edge
   cloud direction, and IP interface should be supported in the uplink
   to the Internet direction.  In other word, FSD will separate the
   east-west flow and south-north flow of the access network.

   There are three kinds of interface should be supported in the
   downlink of the FSD, VLAN interface,QinQ interface and VxLAN
   interface.  VLAN interface is for enterprise subscriber to access in,
   QinQ interface is for internet user,and VxLAN tunnel interface is for
   some VxLAN private line service.

4.3.  Other Function

   Many other functions should be supported in FSD for different
   requirements,as below:

4.3.1.  PUPVPVxLAN function

   For user isolation and VxLAN internal flow statistic and charging.

4.3.2.  Leaf switch function

   for realize the leaf-spine frame in DC Downlink port VLAN,QinQ,

4.3.3.  VxLAN smart mapping to VxLAN

   in uplink port for packet forward

4.3.4.  QoS function and rating limiting in VxLAN

   for Forwarding priority and service control in VxLAN

4.3.5.  EVPN protocol

   for the information synchronization in layer2 network

4.3.6.  DHCP snooping and relay function in VxLAN tunnel

   and so on...

5.  Security Considerations

   Service Gateway must have the capability of checking the validation
   of user's address.

6.  IANA Considerations
