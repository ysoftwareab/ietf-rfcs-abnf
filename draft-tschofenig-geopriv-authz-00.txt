1.    Introduction

   The policy rules defined in this document extend the Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [XCAP]
   and in particular the XML schema in [XCAP-USAGE]. Geopriv adds
   authorization policies beyond what is offered in [XCAP-USAGE]. The
   XML schema in [XCAP-USAGE] is extended with Geopriv specific content
   as described in this document.

   The authorization policies described in this document try to satisfy
   the Elements E through L defined in [Core].

   Section 2 enumerates the Elements E through L with a description of
   a possible way to address them. This includes XML schema snippets
   and examples. Section 3 will (in a future version) provide a full
   XML schema.

2.    Authorization Policies

   This section describes the outcome of the design team working on the
   authorization policies described in [Core]. Code snippets for XML

   schemas, which extend the [XCAP-USAGE] schema, are provided in
   addition to some examples that explain the usage of these policies.

   Most of the elements do not depend on the geospatial content and
   thus should be additions to the basic XCAP authorization schema. For
   instance, the <area> element should be placed in a geopriv-specific
   namespace.


2.1      Element E

   Element E:  Permission to disclose only to someone presenting a
               specified key (for instance, a shared key or the
               private key corresponding to a particular public
               key), or a special type of credential (an e-token to
               be defined).

   [XCAP-USAGE] specifies the elements <auth-mechanism> and <anonymous>
   inside the acceptance permission which allows to refer to SIP
   specific authentication mechanisms such as:

   - None
   - TLS
   - Digest
   - SMIME
   - P-Asserted-ID

   These mechanisms are sufficient for authorization policies in the
   context of SIP and SIP Presence (although splitting TLS according to
   the authentication mechanisms would be more appropriate e.g., public
   key based authentication, Kerberos-based authentication or SRP based
   authentication). For a first version of the Geopriv authorization
   policies these authentication mechanisms and XML elements will be
   reused without modification.

   Another approach, which aims to be more generic and was also
   considered, is to reuse a proposal of an (expired) Internet Draft on
   "Authentication Mechanisms Levels" [Levels]. Instead of enumerating
   different authentication protocols different authentication levels
   are defined such as:

   - None (no authentication)
   - Weak (vulnerable against eavesdroppers)
   - Limited (no protection against active attacks)
   - Strong (protection against active attacks)

   Examples for the different authentication levels are provided in
   [Levels].

   Currently there is no provision in [XCAP-USAGE] to provide
   authorization for anonymous access to location information (e.g. by
   using tokens). A proposal will be described in a separate document.

2.2      Element F

   Element F:  Requirement that the granularity/precision of
               location information be reduced

   In Section 4.2.2.3 of [XCAP-USAGE] content permissions are defined.
   These permissions allow to restrict access to certain XML elements.
   In particular, the use of the <show-element> seems to be useful to
   support the concept of location information reduction. By listing
   only those elements of the location object to which access is
   allowed by a specific individual the granularity can be reduced.
   This approach is similar to <include> statement proposed in [Sch03]
   but the functionality of the <exclude> statement is not provided.
   Adding field exclusion primarily offers efficiency advantages,
   rather than new capabilities and thus can be safely omitted.

   The following three approaches can be used to specify access to
   certain location information elements. Please note that the text-
   values inside the <element-name> </element-name> elements are
   artificial since the format of the location object (civil and
   geospatial) is not yet defined. Hence it should only be treated as a
   hint for the reader what the future content will be.

   a) Leave the XCAP schema unmodified and to repeat the <show-element>
   element (if required)

   As an example, the following authorization policy will be the
   result.

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <permission-statements
        xmlns:pidf="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
        xmlns:rpids="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:sip-rpids"
        xmlns:lo="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv-lo">
        <statement id="as8f">
          <applies-to>
            <uri>sip:mankin@psg.com</uri>
          </applies-to>

          <permissions>
            <accept/>
            <show-namespace>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf
                   </show-namespace>
            <show-element>
              <element-name>rpids:placetype</element-name>

            </show-element>
            <show-element>
              <element-name>lo:civil/c</element-name>
            </show-element>
            <show-element>
              <element-name>lo:civil/a1</element-name>
            </show-element>
            <show-element>
              <element-name>lo:gml/Point</element-name>
            </show-element>
            <any-event/>
          </permissions>

        </statement>
      </permission-statements>

   b) Extend the XCAP schema to allow the <element-name> element to
   appear arbitrarily often

   In the above-mentioned example the modifications would lead to:

       <show-element>
            <element-name>rpids:placetype</element-name>
            <element-name>lo:civil/c</element-name>
            <element-name>lo:civil/a1</element-name>
            <element-name>lo:gml/Point</element-name>
       </show-element>

   The same result is achieved with approach (c). The difference
   between (b) and (c) is only a technical detail and some alignment
   with the [XCAP-USAGE] XML schema. The second option offers a more
   space-efficient encoding of these rules.  We strive to make the rule
   set be space-efficient since it may be transported across bandwidth-
   constrained links and since the number of rules may be large if they
   are automatically generated from external information such as
   address books and calendars.

   c) Enhance the <element-name> element of the XCAP schema itself to
   appear arbitrarily often

              </xs:sequence>
            </xs:sequence>

   It seems to be easiest to use approach (a). More information on the
   attributes provided by the location object is required to illustrate
   useful and complete examples.

2.3      Element G

   Element G:  The ability to provide additional Privacy Rules for
               specific requestors or groups of requestors


   Using the schema extension described below the <permission-
   statements> element of [XCAP-USAGE] is enhanced with an element
   (<additionalGRF>) pointing to additional privacy rules.

   It must be ensured that an implementation prevents infinite loops by
   limiting the inclusion depth. If it is not possible to resolve or

   retrieve the policies at the indicated URL then the location object
   is not returned.

   An alternative approach would be to have the external rule set only
   provide additional permissions, but not allow it to restrict
   permissions granted in the base document. In that case, the rule
   engine may not have to retrieve the additional rules in all cases,
   e.g., if only a particular request needs to be evaluated against a
   rule set rather than generating a set of notifications for all
   recipients.  External rule sets add a number of complications, such
   as privacy concerns (retrieval indicates access to the information),
   reliability and bandwidth issues.


   Schema snippet:

   <xs:schema ....
   xmlns:ps="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:permission-statements" ...>

   <xs:element name="permission-statements"
       type="gp:permission-statements-type">
   <xs:complexType name="permission-statements-type">
      <xs:complexContent>
        <xs:extension base="ps:permission-statements">
           <xs:sequence>
              <xs:element:name="additionalGRF" type="xs:string"
                  minOccurs="0" />
           </xs:sequence>
        </xs:extension>
     </xs:complexContent>
   ...
   </xs:complexType>
   </xs:schema>

   Example:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <permission-statements>

        <statement id="as8f">
          <applies-to>
            <uri>sip:mankin@psg.com</uri>
          </applies-to>

          <permissions>
           <!-- permissions for Allison -->
          </permissions>

        </statement>

      <additionalGRF>
         http://example.com/policies.xml
      </additionalGRF>

      </permission-statements>

   In this example additional privacy rules are available at
   "http://example.com/policies.xml".

2.4      Element H

   Element H:  The ability to define a time until which a permission
               is valid

   To specify a time period until which a permission is valid two
   attributes ("from" and "until") are added to the <permission-
   statements> element. Both, the "from" and the "until" attribute are
   optional. If the "from" attribute is missing then the policies are
   valid immediately. If the "to" attribute is missing then the
   policies have no restricted lifetime. Both attributes use the data
   type dateTime.

   Schema snippet:

   <xs:schema ....
   xmlns:ps="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:permission-statements" ...>

   <xs:element name="permission-statements" type="gp:permission-
   statements-type">
   <xs:complexType name="permission-statements-type">
   <xs:complexContent>
      <xs:extension base="ps:permission-statements">
         <xs:attribute name="from" type="xs:dateTime" use="optional">
         <xs:attribute name="until" type="xs:dateTime" use="optional">
      </xs:extension>
   </xs:complexContent>

   </xs:schema>

   Example:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <permission-statements
            from="2003-09-04T09:00:00" until="2003-09-05T18:00:00">

        <statement id="as8f">
          <applies-to>
            <uri>sip:mankin@psg.com</uri>

                Location Object Authorization Policies     August 2003


          </applies-to>

          <permissions>
           <!-- permissions for Allison -->
          </permissions>

        </statement>

      <additionalGRF>
            http://example.com/policies.xml
      </additionalGRF>

      </permission-statements>

   This example shows that the described policy is valid from the 4th
   of September (9am) to the 5th of September (6pm).

   Note that in order for this extension to work it is necessary to
   specify the <permission-statements> element in [XCAP-USAGE] as
   global (and not as local).

2.5      Element I

   Element I:  The ability to define a geographical area for which
               the permission is valid ("if I am in area x then you
               can tell y my location")

   As part of the discussion regarding Element I it was decided to
   support functionality like:

   a) "Within z km of point x,y, assuming a spherical earth."
   OR
   b) "An equality match on country or state or city (civil location)."

   The assumption about spherical earth provides a good simplification
   and the error is said to be fairly low. Going beyond this, as in "as
   long as I'm within three streets of my home" or "as long as I'm in
   the area bounded by 112 and 120th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and
   Broadway" (which describes the Morningside Heights campus of
   Columbia University) is likely to get messy.

   The details on the location object (for both civil and geospatial
   coordinates) will be provided as soon as the discussions on the
   location object are finished. Hence a placeholder is used for
   illustrative purposes below.

   The <permissions> element is extended to support an element <area>
   which either contains civil location or spherical area (based on GML
   most likely).

                     <lo:a2>NJ</a2>
                     <lo:a3>Bergen</a3>
                   </civil-area>
                </area>
           </permissions>

        </statement>
      </permission-statements>

   In this example location information is provided to Allison only if
   the target is within the indicated area labeled as "bergen" (in
   addition to the other policies).

2.6      Element J

   Element J:  The ability to define a repeatable time window (such
               as weekdays during office hours) during which a
               permission is valid

   Various approaches have been investigated to support a repeatable
   time window such as the flexible approach suggested in [Sch03]:
   "The time recurrence rules are specified using the iCal notation in
   RFC 2445 [RFC2445], translated into XML schema format, roughly
   following the (expired) Internet draft draft-ietf-calsch-many-xcal-
   00. 'exdate' 4.8.5.2, 'rdate' 4.8.5.3, 'rrule', 4.8.5.4.0" (Section
   4.3). It was decided to consider this approach in future version of
   Geopriv authorization policies.

   Other suggestions reused flags for each weekday, included exceptions
   or reused the format of the Unix CRON command.

   Finally it was decided to address a repeatable time window with a
   list of "from"/"until" XML dateTime values. Particularly for non-
   human written authorization policies (which is likely to be case)
   this approach seems to provide sufficient flexibility.

   The following schema snippet extends the <permissions> element and
   adds another child element <recurrence>. The <recurrence> element
   may appear arbitrarily often whereby each element has two sub-
   elements <from> and <until> of data type dateTime. It may be
   unnecessary to have both <from>/<until> and recurrence, since the
   latter is a generalization of the former, but this redundancy may be
   use-friendly.

            <xs:complexContent>
                 <xs:extension base="ps:permissionsType">
                     <xs:sequence>
                        <xs:element:name="recurrence"
                            type="gp:recurrence-type" minOccurs="0"
                            maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                     </xs:sequence>

           </xs:sequence>
       </xs:complexType>

   </xs:schema>

   Example:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <permission-statements
        xmlns:lo="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv-lo">

              </recurrence>
           </permissions>

        </statement>
      </permission-statements>

   This example shows two recurrence elements which approximately
   capture the timeframe of the Geopriv interim meeting. In the example
   Jon Peterson will be able to request the location information of
   target (e.g. Jorge) only during the interim meeting hours.

2.7      Element K

   Element K:  The ability to require that express consent of the
               Target/Rule Maker be obtained prior to disclosing
               location

   The mechanism used to enforce consent requires enhancing the
   <permission> element with a sub-child <consent-required>. The data
   type of this element is anyURI.

   Schema snippet:

   <xs:schema ....
   xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
   xmlns:ps="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:permissions"...>

   <xs:element name="permissions" type="gp:permissions-type">
       <xs:complexType name="permissions-type">
            <xs:complexContent>
                 <xs:extension base="ps:permissionsType">
                     <xs:sequence>
                        <xs:element:name="consent-required"
                           type="xs:anyURI " minOccurs="0"
                           maxOccurs="1"/>
                     </xs:sequence>
                 </xs:extension>
            </xs:complexContent>
       </xs:complexType>

   </xs:schema>

   Example:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <permission-statements
        xmlns:lo="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv-lo">

        <statement id="as8f">

                Location Object Authorization Policies     August 2003


          <applies-to>
            <uri>sip:jon.peterson@neustar.biz</uri>
          </applies-to>

          <permissions>
          <!-- permissions go in here.... -->
           <consent-required>sip:hgs@cs.columbia.edu</consent-required>
           </permissions>

        </statement>
      </permission-statements>

   This example shows the policy which requires to contact Henning
   (hgs@cs.columbia.edu) if Jon asks for location information. There
   currently is no protocol mechanism for inquiring about permissions
   from users.  In order to define an interoperable protocol, the
   design team will strive to provide a protocol mechanism first, if
   that proves feasible, or may remove the feature otherwise.


2.8      Element L

   Element L:  The ability to require that notice be provided to the
               Target if location is provided

   The mechanism used for Element L is similar to the one used for
   Element K. Again the <permissions> element is extended with a
   <notify> element.

   Schema snippet:

   <xs:schema ....
   xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
   xmlns:ps="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:permissions"...>

   <xs:element name="permissions" type="gp:permissions-type">
       <xs:complexType name="permissions-type">
            <xs:complexContent>
                 <xs:extension base="ps:permissionsType">
                     <xs:sequence>
                          <xs:element:name="notify" type="xs:anyURI"
                             minOccurs="0"  maxOccurs="1"/>
                     </xs:sequence>
                 </xs:extension>
            </xs:complexContent>
       </xs:complexType>

   </xs:schema>

                Location Object Authorization Policies     August 2003



   Example:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <permission-statements
        xmlns:lo="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv-lo">

        <statement id="as8f">
          <applies-to>
            <uri>sip:mankin@psg.com</uri>
          </applies-to>

          <permissions>
          <!-- permissions go in here.... -->
           <notify>sip:anewton@ecotroph.net</notify>
           </permissions>

        </statement>
      </permission-statements>

   Andrew Newton (anewton@ecotroph.net) is the rule maker and is
   notified if Allison Mankin (mankin@psg.com) requests access to
   Andrew's location information.

   Section 4.3 of [Sch03] addresses some security considerations with
   this mechanisms and in particular with third-party notifications:

   "This clearly has security implications, since a malicious target
   could use this mechanism to cause messages to be sent to third
   parties, introducing a new form of 'open proxy' spamming. Thus, such
   notification is only appropriate if the notifying party can convince
   itself that the address indeed belongs to the presentity.
   Unfortunately, there is no fool-proof way of ensuring that, but a
   recipient of this information may compare the non-schema part of the
   notification URI with the presentity and only allow notification on
   equality. Given these constraints and the inherent unreliability and
   delays in most current notification mechanisms, a target cannot rely
   on receiving notification."

   Third-party notifications must be ruled out. Related to some
   scenarios presented in this context it might also be possible to use
   some sort of logging statement to provide similar functionality.

   There currently is no protocol mechanism for conveying semantically
   meaningful information about location transmission about permissions
   from users.  In order to define an interoperable protocol, the
   design team will strive to provide a protocol mechanism first, if
   that proves feasible, or may remove the feature otherwise.

3.    XML Schema

   Once full consensus is reached on the authorization policies and on
   how to implement them a full XML schema will be provided.

4.    Security Considerations

   This document raises and addresses some security issues which are
   described in [DM+03]. Some additional security concerns (e.g. denial
   of service attacks) are expressed in [Sch03].

   A future version of this document will structure these threats in
   the appropriate manner once the discussions on the individual
   mechanisms are finished.

5.    Open Issues/Future Work

   - Combining this draft with [Core] draft.
   - How the authorization policies can be used with other using
     protocols such as HTTP.
   - XML Schema
   - More examples
