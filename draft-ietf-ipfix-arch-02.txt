1. Introduction

   There are several applications e.g., Usage-based Accounting, Traffic
   Profiling, Traffic engineering, Attack/Intrusion Detection, QoS
   Monitoring, that require flow-based IP traffic measurements. It is
   hence important to have a standard way of exporting information
   related to IP flows. This document defines architecture for IP
   traffic flow monitoring, measuring and exporting. It provides a
   high-level description of the key components and their functions.


2. Scope

   This document defines architecture for IPFIX. The main objective of
   this document is to:

     * Describe the key architectural components of IPFIX.
     * Define the architectural requirements, e.g., Recovery, Security,
       etc. for the IPFIX framework.
     * Describe the characteristics of IPFIX protocol.


3. Terminology

     * Observation Point:
       The Observation Point is a location in the network where IP
       packets can be observed. Examples are, a line to which a probe is
       attached, a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-based LAN, a
       single port of a router, or a set of interfaces (physical or
       logical) of a router.

       Note that one Observation Point may be a superset of several
       other Observation Points. For example one Observation Point can
       be an entire line card. This would be the superset of the
       individual Observation Points at the line card's interfaces.

     * IP Traffic Flow or Flow:
       A Flow is defined as a set of IP packets passing an Observation
       Point in a network during a certain time interval. All packets
       that belong to a particular Flow have a set of common properties



Sadasivan & Brownlee                                            [Page 3]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


       derived from the data contained in the packet and from the packet
       treatment at the Observation Point.

       In the context of IPFIX a Flow is defined as follows:

       A 'Flow' is a set of IP packets, or encapsulated IP packets,
       passing an Observation Point in the network during a certain time
       interval. All packets belonging to a particular Flow have a set
       of common properties. Each property is defined as the result of
       applying a function to the values of:

         1. One or more header fields of the actual packet, e.g.
            destination IP address, or fields in the packet's
            encapsulation header, e.g. label for MPLS, tunnel end-points
            for IP-in-IP or fields in transport header (e.g. destination
            port number), or fields in application header field (e.g.
            RTP header fields [RFC1889])
         2. One or more properties of the packet itself (e.g. packet
            length)
         3. One or more of fields derived from packet treatment (e.g.
            next hop IP address,AS number)

       A packet is defined to belong to a Flow if it completely
       satisfies all the defined properties of the Flow. Each of the
       fields from 1., 2. and 3. mentioned above are referred to as Flow
       Keys or Keys. This definition covers the range from a Flow
       containing all packets observed at a network interface to a Flow
       consisting of just a single packet between two applications with
       a specific sequence number. Note that the Flow definition does
       not necessarily match a general application-level end-to-end
       stream. Some examples of flows are listed below:

       Example 1:  To create flows, the different fields to distinguish
       flows are defined. The different combination of the field values
       creates unique flows. If the keys are defined as {source IP
       address, destination IP address, DSCP}, then all of these are
       different flows.

         1. {192.1.40.1, 171.6.23.5, 4}
         2. {192.1.40.23, 171.6.23.67, 4}
         3. {192.1.40.23, 171.6.23.67, 2}
         4. {198.20.9.200, 171.6.23.67, 4}

       Example 2:  To create flows, a match function can be applied to
       all the packets that pass through an Observation Point, in order
       to aggregate some values. This could be done by defining the keys
       as {source IP address, destination IP address, TOS} as in the
       example 1, and applying the function which masks the least



Sadasivan & Brownlee                                            [Page 4]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


       significant 8 bits of the source IP address and destination IP
       address (i.e. the result is a /24 address). The 4 flows from
       example 1 would now be aggregated into 3 flows, by merging the
       flows 1. and 2. into a single flow.

         1. {192.1.40.0/24, 171.6.23.0/24, 4}
         2. {192.1.40.0/24, 171.6.23.0/24, 2}
         3. {198.20.9.0/24, 171.6.23.0/24, 4}

       Example 3:  To create flows, a filter defined by some field
       values can be applied on all packets that pass the Observation
       Point, in order to select only certain flows. The filter is
       defined by choosing fixed values for specific fields from the
       packet.

       All the packets that go from a customer network 192.1.40.0/24 to
       another customer network 171.6.23.0/24 with TOS value of 4 define
       a flow. All other combinations don't define a flow and are not
       taken into account. The 3 flows from example 2 would now be
       reduced to 1 flow, by filtering away the second and the third
       flow. {192.1.40.0/24, 171.6.23.0/24, 4}.

       The above example can be thought of as a function F taking as
       input {source IP address, destination IP address, TOS}. The
       function selects only the packets which satisfy all the 3
       conditions which are:

         * mask out the least significant 8 bits of source IP address,
           compare against 192.1.40.0.
         * mask out the least significant 8 bits of destination IP
           address, compare against 171.6.23.0.
         * tos value equal to 4.

       Depending on the values of {source IP address, destination IP
       address, TOS} of the different observed packets, the metering
       process function F would choose/filter/aggregate different sets
       of packets, which would create different flows. In other words,
       based on various combination of values of {source IP address,
       destination IP address, TOS}, F(source IP address, destination IP
       address, TOS) would result in the definition of one or more
       flows. The function F is referred to as Flow Type.

     * Flow Key:
       Each of the fields which belong to
         1. Packet header (e.g. destination IP address)






Sadasivan & Brownlee                                            [Page 5]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


         2. Property of the packet itself (e.g. packet length)
         3. Derived from packet treatment (e.g. AS number)
       which is used to define a Flow is termed as Flow Key.

     * Flow Type:
       A function F which would take input as a set of Flow Keys and
       produce as output one or more Flows depending on the combination
       of values for the set of Flow Keys.

     * Flow Record:
       A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow that was
       observed at an Observation Point. A Flow Record contains measured
       properties of the Flow (e.g. the total number of bytes of all
       packets of the Flow) and usually characteristic properties of the
       Flow (e.g. source IP address).

     * Exporting Process:
       The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more devices
       that collect these (also known as Collecting Processes). The Flow
       Records are generated by one or more Metering Processes.

     * IPFIX Device:
       A device hosting at least an Observation Point, a Metering
       Process and an Exporting Process. Typically, corresponding
       Observation Point(s), Metering Process(es) and Exporting
       Process(es) are co-located at this device, for example at a
       router.

     * Collecting Process:
       The Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more
       Exporting Processes. The Collecting Process might process or
       store received Flow Record, but such actions are out of the scope
       of this document.

     * Collector:
       The device which hosts one or more Collecting Processes.

     * Metering Process:
       The Metering Process generates Flow Records. Input to the process
       are IP packets observed at an Observation Point and packet
       treatment at the Observation Point, for example the selected
       output interface. The Metering Process consists of a set of
       functions that includes packet header capturing, timestamping,
       sampling, classifying, and maintaining Flow Records.

Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


     * Observation Domain:
       A collection of Observation Points and their corresponding
       Metering Processes is termed an Observation Domain.  The
       Observation Domain presents a unique ID to the Collecting Process
       for identifying the export packets generated by it. One or more
       Observation Domains can interface with the same Exporting
       Process. Example: The Observation Domain could be a router line-
       card, composed of several interfaces with each interface being an
       Observation Point.

     * Flow Recording Process:
       The Flows generated from the metering device(s) in an Observation
       Domain MAY be collected into one or more database before
       exporting. This functional block in addition to maintaining the
       Flow database(s) MAY do Flow aggregation, maintain the aggregate
       statistics etc.  This block is optional for an IPFIX device.

     * Template:
       Template is an ordered n-tuple (e.g. <type,length>, TLV), used to
       completely identify the structure and semantics of a particular
       information that needs to be communicated from the IPFIX Device
       to the Collector. Each template is uniquely identifiable by some
       means (e.g. by using a Template ID).

     * Control Information, Data Stream:
       The information that needs to be exported from the IPFIX device
       can be classified into the following categories:

         - Control Information :
           This includes the Flow type definition, selection criteria
           for packets within the Flow sent by the Exporting Process and
           any IPFIX protocol messages (e.g. keepalives). The 'control'
           stream carries all the information needed for the end-points
           to understand the IPFIX protocol, and specifically for the
           receiver to understand and interpret the data sent by the
           sender.

         - Flow Records :
           This includes data records carrying the field values for the
           various observed Flows at each of the Observation Point.  A
           sequence of such records may also be described as a Data
           Stream.

   The definitions in this section are intended be identical with that
   of the terminology used in [IPFIX-REQS] with additional terms
   introduced to help in defining the architecture model.

   In the above figure the IPFIX components are shown in rectangular
   boxes. The interface shown by (*) is applicable only if the optional
   flow recording process is present. Otherwise the metering process(es)
   at the packet level interface directly with the exporting function.
   Note that in case of multiple Observation Domains, a unique ID per
   Observation Pomain must be transmitted as a parameters to the
   exporting function. The exporting process includes IPFIX protocol and
   underlying transport layer.


5. IPFIX Functional and Logical blocks

5.1. Metering Process Functions

   Every observation point in an IPFIX device, partcipating in flow
   measurements, MUST be associated with at least one metering process.
   The packet coming into an observation point goes into each of the
   metering processes associated with the observation point. Broadly,
   each metering process extracts the packet headers that come into an
   observation point, does timestamping and classifies the packet into
   flow(s) based on the selection criteria.


5.1.1. Flow Classification

   The collecting process MUST be able to map the flow record to the
   corresponding property types defined by the flow type. In addition to
   flow type, the collector when it receives the flow records, MAY need
   the following to interpret the flow records further:

     a. Observation Point
     b. Selection Criteria for Packets

   A flow record can be better analyzed if the Observation Point from
   which it is measured is known. As such it is recommended that the
   flow record carry the Observation Point information along with the
   flow records when exported. In cases where there is a single
   observation point or where the observation point information is not
   relevant, the metering process MAY choose not to add this to the flow
   records.


5.1.2. Selection Criteria for Packets

   The measurement device MAY define rules so that only certain packets
   within a flow can be chosen for measurement at an observation point.
   This MAY be done by one of the two methods defined below or a
   combination of them. A combination of each of these ways can be



Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 10]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


   adopted to select the packets, i.e. one can define a set of methods
   {F1, S1, F2, S2, S3} executed in a certain sequence at an observation
   point to collect flows of a particular type.


5.1.3. Function on properties that determines a flow type (Fi)

   Packets that satisfy a function on the fields defined by the packet
   header fields or fields obtained while doing the packet processing or
   the properties of the packet itself.

   Example:  Mask/Match of the fields that define a filter. The filter
   may be defined as {Protocol == TCP, Destination Port between 80 and
   120}.

   Multiple such filters could be used in any sequence to select
   packets.


5.1.4. Sampling packets on a flow type (Si)

   Packets that satisfy the sampling criteria for this flow type.

   Example:  Sample every 100th packet that was received at an
   observation point and collect the flow information for a particular
   flow type.  choosing all the packets is a special case where sampling
   rate is 1:1.

   The figure below shows the operations which MAY be applied as part of
   a typical metering process.

Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 11]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


5.2. Observation Domain

   The Observation Domain is a logical block that presents a single
   identity for a group of Observation Points within an IPFIX device.
   Each {Observation point, Metering Process} MUST belong to a single
   Observation Domain.  An IPFIX device could have multiple Observation
   Domains each of which has a subset of the total set of Observation
   Points in it. Each Observation Domain MUST carry an unique ID within
   the context of an IPFIX device. One exporting process MAY serve
   multiple Observation Domains. In such a case the exporting process
   uses this unique ID to distinguish export packets among the different
   Observation Domains. The same concept is used at the collecting
   process also to identify packets from different Observation Domains
   from the same IPFIX device.


5.3. Flow Recording Process

   The Flow Recording Process is a functional block, which manages all
   the flows generated from an Observation Domain.  The typical
   functions of a Flow Recording Process MAY include:

     * Maintain database(s) of all the flows from an Observation Domain.
       This includes creating new records, updating existing ones,
       computing flow statistics, deriving further flow properties,
       adding non-flow specific information (in some cases fields like
       AS numbers, router state etc.)
     * Maintain aggregate statistics like flows generated, flows
       exported etc.

   It is not mandatory that every IPFIX device use a Flow Recording
   Process.  Instead the flows generated by the metering process can be
   directly sent to the exporting process.


5.4. Exporting Process

   The Exporting Process is the functional block that includes one or
   more instances of IPFIX protocol. On one side it interfaces with
   metering process/flow recording process to get flow records and on
   the other side, talks to a collecting processs on the collector(s).










Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 12]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


5.5. IPFIX protocol

   At the IPFIX device, the protocol functionality resides in the
   exporting process. The IPFIX protocol gets flows from flow recording
   process or directly from the metering process, and carries them to
   the collector(s).


   At a high level, the IPFIX protocol at an IPFIX device does the
   following:

   Maintain rules for :
     1. Picking and sending control information and flow records.
     2. Encoding control and flow record information based on the IPFIX
        Information Model [IPFIX-IMODEL].
     3. Flow expiration.
     4. IPFIX device overload handling.
     5. Selective export of flow records if any.


   Functions :
     1. Encode the selected control information into templates.
     2. Encode the flows observed at the observation points into flow
        records.
     3. Packetize the selected templates and flow records into IPFIX
        export packets.
     4. Use the underlying transport layer to send the export packets to
        the collector.
     5. Handle export errors and timeouts.
     6. Handle IPFIX device overload.
     7. Apply selective export filters if any to the flow records.

   For details on IPFIX protocol, refer to [IPFIX-PROTO].


6. Encoding Control Information

   The following rules provide guidelines to be followed while encoding
   the control information.

     - Per-flow control information SHOULD be encoded such that it can
       capture the structure and semantics of the corresponding flow
       data for each of the flows exported by the IPFIX device.
     - Configuration control information SHOULD be encoded such that it
       can capture the structure and semantics of the corresponding
       configuration data. The configuration data which is also control
       information, SHOULD carry additional information on the boundary
       within which the configuration takes effect. Forexample, sampling



Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 13]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


       using the same sampling algorithm, say 1 in 100 packets is
       configured on 2 observation points O1 and O2. The configuration
       in this case MAY be encoded as <ID, boundary (O1,O2), sampling
       algorithm, interval (1 in 100)> where ID uniquely identifies this
       configuration.
     - There SHOULD be provisions to encode fixed length and variable
       length fields
     - All fields MUST be encoded in network byte order.
     - The exporter MUST encode a given field based on the encoding
       standards prescribed by [IPFIX-PROTO].


7. Encoding Flow Data Information

   The following rules provide guidelines to be followed while encoding
   the flow data information.

     - A flow data record SHOULD contain enough information so that the
       collecting process can identify the corresponding <Per-flow
       control information, Configuration control information>.
     - All fields MUST be encoded in network byte order.
     - The exporter MUST encode a given field based on the encoding
       standards prescribed by [IPFIX-PROTO].


8. Exporting Control Information

   The Control Information is used by the collecting process to :
     - Decode and interpret flow records.
     - Understand the state of the exporting process.

       As such sending control information from exporting process in a
       timely and reliable manner is critical to the proper
       functionality of the IPFIX collecting process. The following
       approaches MAY be taken for the export of control information.

         1. Send all the control information pertaining to flow records
            prior to sending the flow records themselves. This includes
            any incremental changes that happens to the definition of
            the flow records.

         2. Notify on a near real time basis the state of the IPFIX
            device to the collecting process. This includes all changes
            such as a configuration change that affects the flow
            behavior, changes to exporting process resources that alter
            export rates, etc., which the collector needs to be aware
            of.




Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 14]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


         3. Since it is vital that a collecting process maintains
            accurate knowledge of the exprtoer's state, the export of
            the control information SHOULD be done such that that it
            reaches the collector reliably. One way to achieve this
            would be to send the control information over a reliable
            transport.


9. Flow Expiration and Export

   A flow is considered to be inactive if no packets of this flow have
   been observed at the observation point for a given timeout interval.
   The flow MAY be expired and exported under the following conditions:

     1. If the Metering Process can deduce the end of a Flow. The Flow
        SHOULD be exported when the end of the Flow is detected. For
        example: flow generated by TCP type of traffic where the FIN or
        RST bits indicate the end of the flow.

     2. If the Flow has been inactive for a certain period of time.
        This inactivity timeout SHOULD be configurable at the Metering
        Process, with a minimum value of 0 for an immediate expiration.
        For example: flow generated by UDP type of traffic.

     3. For long-running flows, the Exporting Process MAY export the
        flow records on regular basis. Some of the reasons for doing
        this would be:

          a. Report the flow records periodic accounting information to
             the collecting process.
          b. Avoid counter wrapping.

        When a long-running flow is exported, the flow MAY still  be
        maintained in the IPFIX device so that for the incoming packets
        that continue to come on the same flow, a new flow does not get
        created in the flow recording data base.

     4. In some cases flows MAY be exported as they are generated. This
        can be useful when real time processing of flow records is
        required.

     5. If the IPFIX device experiences resource constraints, a flow MAY
        be prematurely expired (example: memory)

     6. In some cases flows the exporting process MAY choose not to
        export the generated flow as is. For example, this happens if
        the a set of flows are aggregated into more coarse flows.

Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


10. Export Error Handling

   This section describes some of the errors that may be encountered:

     - In IPFIX protocol while doing export.
     - Feedback received by IPFIX protocol from other entities in the
       export path towards the collector.

     1. Unavailability of resources e.g. packet buffers for IPFIX export
        packets.
     2. Error in transport layer.

   The protocol MAY choose to do one or more of the following actions:
     - Buffer the flow records until the error condition gets corrected.
     - Drop flow records for one or more flows based on some rules. In
       such a case a record of what action is taken MUST be maintained,
       e.g. n flow records of a flow were dropped.



10.1. Selection Criteria of flows for export

   There MAY be additional rules defined within the context observation
   domain so that only certain flows records are picked up for export.
   This MAY be done by either one or a combination of Si, Fi which is
   described in the section on "Selection Criteria for Packets".

   Example:  Only the flow records which meet the following selection
   criteria are exported.

     1. All flow records whose destination IP address matches
        {20.3.1.5}.
     2. Every other (.i.e. sampling rate 1 in 2) flow record whose
        destination IP address matches {160.0.1.30}.


11. The Selected IPFIX Protocol

   There are existing standard practices in the area of flow export like
   Netflow, CRANE, LFAP etc. IPFIX's charter mentions to choose the
   protocol among these existing practices that fits the IPFIX
   requirements the most. There may be additions or modifications made
   to the chosen protocol to fit it exactly into the IPFIX architecture.

   The working group went through an extensive evaluation of the various
   existing protocols that are available today weighing the level of
   compliance with the requirements and architecture and finally
   selected Netflow V9 with minor modification as the basis for the



Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 16]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


   IPFIX protocol. Following is a brief description of the chosen IPFIX
   basis protocol; details of the IPFIX protocol proper are given in
   [IPFIX-PROTO].

   This protocol is template based. A template in terms of Netflow V9 is
   a collection of fields with corresponding descriptions of their
   structures and their semantics which is in strict conformance with
   IPFIX architecture.

   This approach provides the following advantages:

     - Using the template mechanism, new fields can be added to IPFIX
       flow records without changing the structure of the export record
       format.
     - Templates that are sent to the collecting process contain the
       structural information about the exported flow record fields.
       Therefore, if the collector does not understand the semantics of
       new fields it can still interpret the flow record.
     - Because the template mechanism is flexible, it allows the export
       of only the required fields from the flows to the collecting
       process. This helps to reduce the exported flow data volume and
       possibly provide memory savings at the Exporting Process and
       Collecting Process. Sending only the required information can
       also reduce network load.


   The figure below shows the functions performed in sequence by the
   various functional blocks in an IPFIX device.

12. Collecting Process

   A Collecting Process is a subsystem that interacts with one or more
   IPFIX devices. The functions of the collecting process MAY include:

     * Identifying, accepting and decoding export packets from different
       {Exporting Process, Observation Domain} pairs .
     * Running the IPFIX protocol.
     * Storing the control information and flow records received from
       IPFIX device.
     * Notifying the IPFIX device its status and problems.


   At a high level, IPFIX protocol at the collecting process is
   responsible for the following:

     1. Receive and store the control information.
     2. Decode and store the flow records using the control information.
     3 Optionally monitor the status of the collecting process and
       execute a fail over in case of problem.


12.1. IPFIX Protocol on Collecting Process

     1. Receive and decode the flow records from the IPFIX devices.
     2. Ability to indicate flow record losses to the exporting IPFIX
        device and/or IPFIX users.
     3. Optionally notify the status and overload conditions to the
        IPFIX device.
   Once the selection is made from the set of candidate protocols, this
   section would be replaced by the chosen protocol.


12.2. Support for Applications

   Applications that use the information collected by IPFIX may be
   Billing, Intrusion Detection sub-systems, etc. These applications may
   be an integral part of the collecting process or collocated with the
   collecting process. The way by which these applications interface
   with IPFIX system to get the desired information is out of this
   document's scope.










Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 20]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


12.3. Export Models

12.3.1. Export Model with Reliable Control Connection

   As mentioned in the [IPFIX-REQS], the control information and data
   stream MUST be transported over a congestion-aware transport
   protocol. If the network in which the IPFIX device and collecting
   process are located does not guarantee reliability, at least the
   control information SHOULD be exported over a reliable transport.
   There could be network security concerns between IPFIX device and
   collecting process. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, and to reduce
   the complexity of flow export protocol, one or a combination of the
   following methods MAY be adopted as a solution to achieve security :

     * IP Authentication Header MAY be used when the threat environment
       requires stronger integrity protections, but does not require
       confidentiality.
     * IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) MAY be used to provide
       confidentiality and integrity.
     * If the transport protocol used is TCP, optionally TCP MD5
       signature option MAY be used to protect against spoofed TCP
       segments.
     * If the transport protocol used is TCP, optionally TLS MAY be used
       to add integrity, authenticity and confidentiality.

   The data stream MAY be exported over a reliable or unreliable
   transport protocol.

   As explained above the transport connection (in the case of a
   connection oriented protocol) is pre-setup between the IPFIX device
   and the collector. Once connected, the collector side receives the
   control information and uses this information to interpret the flow
   records. The IPFIX device SHOULD set the keepalive (e.g. keepalive
   timeout in the case of TCP; the HEARTBEAT interval in the case of
   SCTP; IPFIX protocol level Keepalive if any) to a sufficiently low
   value so that it can quickly detect a collector crash.


12.4. Collector Crash Detection and Recovery

   Collector crash refers to crash or restart of collecting process or
   the collector itself.









Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 21]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


12.4.1. Export Model with Reliable Control Connection

   The collector crash is detected at the IPFIX device by the break in
   control connection (depending on the transport protocol the
   connection timeout mechanisms differ). On detecting a Keepalive
   timeout, the IPFIX device SHOULD stop sending the flow export data to
   the collector and try reconnecting the transport connection. This is
   valid for a single collector scenario. If there are multiple
   collectors for the same IPFIX device, the IPFIX device opens control
   connections to each of the collectors.  But data gets sent only to
   one of the collectors which is chosen as the primary. There could be
   one or more collectors configured as secondary and a priority
   assigned to them. The primary collector crash is detected at the
   IPFIX device by the break in control connection (depending on the
   transport protocol the connection timeout mechanisms differ). On
   detecting loss of connectivity, the IPFIX device opens data stream
   with the secondary collector of the next highest priority. This
   collector now becomes the primary. The maximum export data loss would
   be the amount of data exported in the time between when the loss of
   connectivity to the collector happened, and the time at which this
   was detected by the IPFIX device.


12.5. Collector Redundancy

   Since IPFIX protocol requires a congestion-aware transport, achieving
   redundancy using multicast is not an option. Multiple <control
   information, data stream> pairs could be setup, each to a different
   collector from the same IPFIX device. The control and data
   information are then replicated on each of the control information
   and data stream. Add text here.


13. IPFIX flow collection from Special Devices

   IPFIX could be implemented on devices which perform one or more of
   the following special services :

     * Explicitly drop packets. For example a device which provides
       firewall service drops packets based on some administrative
       policy.
     * Alter the values of fields used as IPFIX flow keys of interest.
       For example a device which provides NAT service can change source
       or(and) destination IP address.

   In the cases above, there should be clear guidelines as to





Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 22]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


     - How and when to classify the packets as flows in the IPFIX device
     - What extra information be  exported so that the collector can
       make a clear interpretation of the received flow records.



14. IPFIX flow collection for special traffic

   An IPFIX device could be doing one or more of generating, receiving,
   altering special types of traffic which are listed below.

     * Tunnel traffic: The IPFIX device could be the head, midpoint or
       endpoint of a tunnel. In such cases the IPFIX could be handling
       GRE, IPinIP, UTI traffic.
     * VPN traffic: The IPFIX device could be a Provider Edge device
       which receives traffic from customer sites belonging to different
       Virtual Private Networks.


   In the cases above, there should be clear guidelines as to

     - How and when to classify the packets as flows in the IPFIX
       device.
     - If multiple encapsulations are used to define flows, how to
       convey the same fields (e.g. IP address) in different layers.
     - How to differentiate flows based on different private domains.
       For example, overlapping IP addresses in Layer-3 VPNs


15. Security Considerations

   IP flow information can be used for various purposes, such as usage
   accounting, traffic profiling, traffic engineering, and intrusion
   detection. For each application, the security requirement may differ
   significantly from one to another. To be able to satisfy the security
   needs of various IPFIX users, the architecture of IPFIX MUST provide
   different levels of security protection.


15.1. Data security

   IPFIX data consists of control information and data stream generated
   by the IPFIX device.

   The IPFIX data may exist in both the IPFIX device and the collector.
   In addition, the data is also transferred on the wire from the IPFIX
   device to the collector when it is reported. To provide security, the
   data SHOULD be protected from adversary.



Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 23]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


   The protection of IPFIX data within the end system (IPFIX device and
   collector) is out of the scope. It is assumed that the end system
   operator will provide adequate security for the IPFIX data.

   The IPFIX architecture MUST allow different levels of protection to
   the IPFIX data on the wire. Where ever security functions are
   required it is recommended to leverage to lower layers using either
   IPsec or TLS, if they can successfully satisfy the security
   requirement of IPFIX data protection.

   To protect the data on the wire, three levels of granularity SHOULD
   be supported:


15.1.1. No security

   Security may not be required when the transport between the IPFIX
   device and the collector is perceived as safe. This option allows the
   protocol to run most efficiently without extra overhead and an IPFIX
   solution MUST support it.


15.1.2. Authentication only

   The authentication only protection provides the IPFIX users the
   assurance of data integrity and authenticity. The data exchanged
   between the IPFIX device and the collector is protected by
   authentication signature. Any modification of the IPFIX data will be
   detected by the recipient, resulting in discarding of the received
   data. However, the authentication only option doesn't offer data
   confidentiality. The IPFIX user SHOULD avoid use this option when
   sensitive or confidential information is being exchanged.  An IPFIX
   solution SHOULD support this option. The authentication only option
   SHOULD provide replay attack protection. Some means to achieve this
   level of security are:
     * TCP with MD5 options.
     * IP Authentication Header


15.1.3. Encryption

   Data encryption provides the best protection for IPFIX data. The
   IPFIX data is encrypted at the sender and only the intended recipient
   can decrypt and have access to the data. This option MUST be used
   when the transport between the IPFIX device and the collector are
   unsafe and the IPFIX data needs to be protected. It is recommended to
   use the underlying security layer functions for this purpose. Some
   means to achieve this level of security are:



Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 24]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


     * Encapsulating Security Payload.
     * Transport Layer Security Protocol

   The data encryption option adds overhead to the IPFIX data transfer.
   It may limit the rate that an export can report its flow to the
   collector due to the heavy resource requirement of running
   encryption.


15.2. IPFIX end point authentication

   It is important to make sure that the IPFIX device is talking to the
   "right" collector instead of a masqueraded collector. The same logic
   also holds true from the collector point of view that it want to make
   sure it is collecting the flow information from the "right" IPFIX
   device. The IPFIX architecture SHOULD allow the authentication
   capability so that either one-way or mutual authentication can be
   performed between the IPFIX device and collector.

   The IPFIX architecture SHOULD use the existing transport protection
   protocols such as TLS or IPSEC to fulfill the authentication
   requirement.


16. IPFIX overload

   An IPFIX device could get overloaded under various conditions. This
   MAY lead to:
     - Exhaustion of internal resources used for flow generation and/or
       export.
     -


16.1. Denial of service (DoS) attack prevention

   Since one of the potential usages for IPFIX is for intrusion
   detection, it is important for the IPFIX architecture to support some
   kind of DoS resistance.


16.1.1. Network under attack

   The Network itself may be under attack, resulting in an overwhelming
   number of IPFIX messages. The IPFIX SHOULD try to capture as much
   information as possible. However, when large amount IPFIX messages
   are generated in a short period of time, the IPFIX may become
   overloaded.




Sadasivan & Brownlee                                           [Page 25]


Internet Draft        draft-ietf-ipfix-arch-02.txt          October 2003


16.1.2. Generic DoS attack on the IPFIX system

   The IPFIX system may subject to generic DoS attacks, just as any
   system on any open networks. These types of attacks are not IPFIX
   specific. Preventing and responding to such types of attacks are out
   of the scope of IPFIX WG.


16.1.3. IPFIX Specific DoS attack

   There is a specific attack on the IPFIX portion of the IPFIX device
   or Collector.
     - The attacker could pound the  Collector with spoofed IPFIX export
       packets. One way to solve this problem is to periodically
       synchronize the sequence numbers of the flow records between
       exporting process and the collecting process.
     - The attacker could provide false reports to the IPFIX device by
       sending spoofed control packets.


   The problems mentioned above can be solved to a large extent if the
   control packets are encrypted both ways.

   (To be added and discussed on the general list).


17. IANA Considerations

   Need Port number assigned from IANA [more to be written]
