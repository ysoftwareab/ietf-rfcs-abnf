INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


1. Introduction

   This document specifies the requirements and defines a reference
   framework for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM, [RFC6291]). In this context, we use the term EVPN
   OAM to loosely refer to the OAM functions required for and/or
   applicable to [RFC7432] and [RFC7623].

   EVPN is an Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) solution for multipoint Ethernet
   services, with advanced multi-homing capabilities, using BGP for
   distributing customer/client MAC address reachability information
   over the core MPLS/IP network.

   PBB-EVPN combines Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) [802.1Q] with EVPN
   in order to reduce the number of BGP MAC advertisement routes,
   provide client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation and B-MAC
   sub-netting, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active
   flows, offer per site policies, and avoid C-MAC address flushing on
   topology changes.

   This document focuses on the fault management and performance
   management aspects of EVPN OAM. It defines the layered OAM model
   encompassing the EVPN service layer, network layer, underlying Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) transport layer, and link layer but focuses on
   the service and network layers.



1.1 Relationship to Other OAM Work

   This document leverages concepts and draws upon elements defined
   and/or used in the following documents:

   [RFC6136] specifies the requirements and a reference model for OAM as
   it relates to L2VPN services, pseudowires and associated Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) tunnels. This document focuses on VPLS and
   VPWS solutions and services.

   [RFC8029] defines mechanisms for detecting data plane failures in
   MPLS LSPs, including procedures to check the correct operation of the
   data plane, as well as mechanisms to verify the data plane against
   the control plane.

   [802.1Q] specifies the Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
   protocol, which defines the concepts of Maintenance Domains,
   Maintenance Associations, Maintenance End Points, and Maintenance
   Intermediate Points.

   [Y.1731] extends Connectivity Fault Management in the following
   areas: it defines fault notification and alarm suppression functions


Salam et al                                                     [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


   for Ethernet.  It also specifies mechanisms for Ethernet performance
   management, including loss, delay, jitter, and throughput
   measurement.



1.2 Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.



1.3 Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology much of which is defined
   in [RFC6136]:

   CE    Customer Edge device, e.g., a host, router, or switch.

   DF    Designated Forwarder

   EVI   An EVPN instance spanning the Provider Edge (PE) devices
         participating in that EVPN.

         Maintenance Domain, established to verify the integrity of a
         single service instance.

   MEP   Maintenance End Point is responsible for origination and
         termination of OAM frames for a given MA.

   MIP   Maintenance Intermediate Point is located between peer MEPs and
         can process and respond to certain OAM frames but does not
         initiate them.

   MD    Maintenance Domain, an OAM Domain that represents a region over
         which OAM frames can operate unobstructed.

   MP2P  Multipoint to Point.

2. EVPN OAM Framework



2.1 OAM Layering

   Multiple layers come into play for implementing an L2VPN service
   using the EVPN family of solutions as listed below. The focus of this
   document is the Service and Network layers.

   - The Service Layer runs end to end between the sites or Ethernet
     Segments that are being interconnected by the EVPN solution.

   - The Network Layer extends between the EVPN PE (Provider Edge) nodes
     and is mostly transparent to the core P (Provider) nodes (except
     where Flow Entropy comes into play). It leverages MPLS for service
     (i.e., EVI) multiplexing and Split-Horizon functions.

   - The Transport Layer is dictated by the networking technology of the
     PSN. It may be either based on MPLS LSPs or IP.

   - The Link Layer is dependent upon the physical technology used.
     Ethernet is a popular choice for this layer, but other alternatives
     are deployed (e.g., POS, DWDM etc.).

   This layering extends to the set of OAM protocols that are involved
   in the ongoing maintenance and diagnostics of EVPN networks. Figure 1
   below depicts the OAM layering, and shows which devices have
   visibility into what OAM layer(s).

                          Figure 1: OAM Layering

   Service OAM and Network OAM mechanisms only have visibility to the PE
   (Provider Edge) nodes but not the P nodes (Provider network interior
   nodes). As such, they can be used to deduce whether the fault is in
   the customer's own network, the local CE-PE segment, the PE-PE

   segment or the remote CE-PE segment(s). EVPN Transport OAM mechanisms
   can be used for fault isolation between the PEs and P nodes.

   Figure 2 below shows an example network where native Ethernet domains
   are interconnected via EVPN using MPLS and gives the OAM mechanisms
   applicable at each layer. The details of the layers are described in
   the sections below.

                        Figure 2: EVPN OAM Example



2.2 EVPN Service OAM

   The EVPN Service OAM protocol depends on what service layer
   technology is being interconnected by the EVPN solution. In case of
   [RFC7432] and [RFC7623], the service layer is Ethernet; hence, the
   corresponding service OAM protocol is Ethernet Connectivity Fault
   Management (CFM) [802.1Q].

   EVPN service OAM is visible to the CEs and EVPN PEs, but not to the
   core (P) nodes. This is because the PEs operate at the Ethernet MAC
   layer in [RFC7432] [RFC7623] whereas the P nodes do not.

   The EVPN PE MUST support MIP functions in the applicable service OAM
   protocol, for example Ethernet CFM. The EVPN PE SHOULD support MEP
   functions in the applicable service OAM protocol. This includes both
   Up and Down MEP functions. As shown in Figure 3, the MIP and MEP
   functions being referred to are logically located within the CE
   facing port of a PE. Down MEP functions are towards the CE. Up MEP
   functions are towards the PE forwarding mechanism. CFM between the PE
   Up MEPs is a type of EVPN Network OAM while CFM between the CEs or
   from a PE to its local CE or to the remote CE is Service OAM.

                           Figure 3: CFM Details

   The EVPN PE MUST learn the MAC address of locally attached CE MEPs by
   snooping on CFM frames and advertising them to remote PEs as a MAC/IP
   Advertisement route.

   The EVPN PE SHOULD advertise any MEP/MIP local to the PE as a MAC/IP
   Advertisement route. Since these are not subject to mobility, they
   SHOULD be advertised with the static (sticky) bit set (see Section
   15.2 of [RFC7432]).



2.3 EVPN Network OAM

   EVPN Network OAM is visible to the PE nodes only. This OAM layer is
   analogous to VCCV [RFC5085] in the case of VPLS/VPWS. It provides
   mechanisms to check the correct operation of the data plane, as well
   as a mechanism to verify the data plane against the control plane.
   This includes the ability to perform fault detection and diagnostics
   on:

   - the MP2P tunnels used for the transport of unicast traffic between
     PEs. EVPN allows for three different models of unicast label
     assignment: label per EVI, label per <ESI, Ethernet Tag> and label
     per MAC address. In all three models, the label is bound to an EVPN
     Unicast FEC.  EVPN Network OAM MUST provide mechanisms to check the
     operation of the data plane and verify that operation against the
     control plane view.

   - the MP2P tunnels used for aliasing unicast traffic destined to a
     multi-homed Ethernet Segment. The three label assignment models,
     discussed above, apply here as well. In all three models, the label
     is bound to an EVPN Aliasing FEC. EVPN Network OAM MUST provide
     mechanisms to check the operation of the data plane and verify that
     operation against the control plane view.

   - the multicast tunnels (either MP2P or P2MP) used for the transport


Salam et al                                                     [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


     of broadcast, unknown unicast and multicast traffic between PEs. In
     the case of ingress replication, a label is allocated per EVI or
     per <EVI, Ethernet Tag> and is bound to an EVPN Multicast FEC. In
     the case of LSM (Label Switched Multicast), and more specifically
     aggregate inclusive trees, again a label may be allocated per EVI
     or per <EVI, Ethernet Tag> and is bound to the tunnel FEC.

   - the correct operation of the ESI split-horizon filtering function.
     In EVPN, a label is allocated per multi-homed Ethernet Segment for
     the purpose of performing the access split-horizon enforcement. The
     label is bound to an EVPN Ethernet Segment.

   - the correct operation of the DF (Designated Forwarder) filtering
     function.  EVPN Network OAM MUST provide mechanisms to check the
     operation of the data plane and verify that operation against the
     control plane view for the DF filtering function.

   EVPN Network OAM mechanisms MUST provide in-band monitoring
   capabilities. As such, OAM messages MUST be encoded so that they
   exhibit identical entropy characteristics to data traffic in order
   that they share the same fate.

   EVPN Network OAM SHOULD provide both proactive and on-demand
   mechanisms of monitoring the data plane operation and data plane
   conformance to the state of the control plane.



2.4 Transport OAM for EVPN

   The transport OAM protocol depends on the nature of the underlying
   transport technology in the PSN. MPLS OAM mechanisms [RFC8029]
   [RFC6425] as well as ICMP [RFC792] are applicable, depending on
   whether the PSN employs MPLS or IP transport, respectively.
   Furthermore, BFD mechanisms per [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883] and
   [RFC5884] apply. Also, the BFD mechanisms pertaining to MPLS-TP LSPs
   per [RFC6428] are applicable.



2.5 Link OAM

   Link OAM depends on the data link technology being used between the
   PE and P nodes. For example, if Ethernet links are employed, then
   Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] Clause 57 may be used.







Salam et al                                                    [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


2.6 OAM Inter-working

   When inter-working two networking domains, such as native Ethernet
   and EVPN to provide an end-to-end emulated service, there is a need
   to identify the failure domain and location, even when a PE supports
   both the Service OAM mechanisms and the EVPN Network OAM mechanisms.
   In addition, scalability constraints may not allow running proactive
   monitoring, such as Ethernet Continuity Check Messages (CCMs), at a
   PE to detect the failure of an EVI across the EVPN domain. Thus, the
   mapping of alarms generated upon failure detection in one domain
   (e.g., native Ethernet or EVPN network domain) to the other domain is
   needed. There are also cases where a PE may not be able to process
   Service OAM messages received from a remote PE over the PSN even when
   such messages are defined, as in the Ethernet case, thereby
   necessitating support for fault notification message mapping between
   the EVPN Network domain and the Service domain.

   OAM inter-working is not limited though to scenarios involving
   disparate network domains. It is possible to perform OAM inter-
   working across different layers in the same network domain. In
   general, alarms generated within an OAM layer, as a result of
   proactive fault detection mechanisms, may be injected into its client
   layer OAM mechanisms. This allows the client layer OAM to trigger
   event-driven (i.e., asynchronous) fault notifications. For example,
   alarms generated by the Link OAM mechanisms may be injected into the
   Transport OAM layer, and alarms generated by the Transport OAM
   mechanism may be injected into the Network OAM mechanism, and so on.

   EVPN OAM MUST support inter-working between the Network OAM and
   Service OAM mechanisms. EVPN OAM MAY support inter-working among
   other OAM layers.

3. EVPN OAM Requirements

   This section discusses the EVPN OAM requirements pertaining to Fault
   Management and Performance Management.



3.1 Fault Management Requirements



3.1.1 Proactive Fault Management Functions

   The network operator configures proactive fault management functions
   to run periodically without a time bound. Certain actions, for
   example protection switchover or alarm indication signaling, can be
   associated with specific events, such as entering or clearing fault
   states.



3.1.1.1 Fault Detection (Continuity Check)

   Proactive fault detection is performed by periodically monitoring the
   reachability between service endpoints, i.e., MEPs in a given MA,
   through the exchange of Continuity Check messages. The reachability
   between any two arbitrary MEPs may be monitored for:

   - in-band per-flow monitoring. This enables per flow monitoring
     between MEPs. EVPN Network OAM MUST support fault detection with
     per user flow granularity. EVPN Service OAM MAY support fault
     detection with per user flow granularity.

   - a representative path. This enables liveness check of the nodes
     hosting the MEPs assuming that the loss of continuity to the MEP is
     interpreted as a failure of the hosting node. This, however, does
     not conclusively indicate liveness of the path(s) taken by user

     failure detection, through the use of a test flow. EVPN Network OAM
     and Service OAM MUST support fault detection using test flows.

   - all paths. For MPLS/IP networks with ECMP, monitoring of all
     unicast paths between MEPs (on non-adjacent nodes) may not be
     possible, since the per-hop ECMP hashing behavior may yield
     situations where it is impossible for a MEP to pick flow entropy
     characteristics that result in exercising the exhaustive set of
     ECMP paths. Monitoring of all ECMP paths between MEPs (on non-
     adjacent nodes) is not a requirement for EVPN OAM.

   The fact that MPLS/IP networks do not enforce congruency between

INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


   unicast and multicast paths means that the proactive fault detection
   mechanisms for EVPN networks MUST provide procedures to monitor the
   unicast paths independently of the multicast paths. This applies to
   EVPN Service OAM and Network OAM.



3.1.1.2 Defect Indication

   EVPN Service OAM MUST support event-driven defect indication upon the
   detection of a connectivity defect. Defect indications can be
   categorized into two types: forward and reverse defect indications.



3.1.1.2.1 Forward Defect Indication

   This is used to signal a failure that is detected by a lower layer
   OAM mechanism. A server MEP (i.e., an actual or virtual MEP)
   transmits a Forward Defect Indication in a direction that is away
   from the direction of the failure (refer to Figure 4 below).

                               Failure
                                 |
          +-----+      +-----+   V   +-----+      +-----+
          |  A  |------|  B  |--XXX--|  C  |------|  D  |
          +-----+      +-----+       +-----+      +-----+

              <===========|             |============>
                Forward                    Forward
                Defect                     Defect
                Indication                 Indication

                    Figure 4: Forward Defect Indication

   Forward defect indication may be used for alarm suppression and/or
   for purpose of inter-working with other layer OAM protocols. Alarm
   suppression is useful when a transport/network level fault translates
   to multiple service or flow level faults. In such a scenario, it is
   enough to alert a network management station (NMS) of the single
   transport/network level fault in lieu of flooding that NMS with a
   multitude of Service or Flow granularity alarms. EVPN PEs SHOULD
   support Forward Defect Indication in the Service OAM mechanisms.



3.1.1.2.2 Reverse Defect Indication (RDI)

   RDI is used to signal that the advertising MEP has detected a loss of
   continuity (LoC) defect. RDI is transmitted in the direction of the

   failure (refer to Figure 5).

                               Failure
                                 |
          +-----+      +-----+   V   +-----+      +-----+
          |  A  |------|  B  |--XXX--|  C  |------|  D  |
          +-----+      +-----+       +-----+      +-----+

              |===========>             <============|
                Reverse                    Reverse

                Indication                 Indication

                    Figure 5: Reverse Defect Indication

   RDI allows single-sided management, where the network operator can
   examine the state of a single MEP and deduce the overall health of a
   monitored service. EVPN PEs SHOULD support Reverse Defect Indication
   in the Service OAM mechanisms. This includes both the ability to
   signal LoC defect to a remote MEP, as well as the ability to
   recognize RDI from a remote MEP. Note that, in a multipoint MA, RDI
   is not a useful indicator of unidirectional fault.  This is because
   RDI carries no indication of the affected MEP(s) with which the
   sender had detected a LoC defect.



3.1.2 On-Demand Fault Management Functions

   On-demand fault management functions are initiated manually by the
   network operator and continue for a time bound period. These
   functions enable the operator to run diagnostics to investigate a
   defect condition.



3.1.2.1 Connectivity Verification

   EVPN Network OAM MUST support on-demand connectivity verification
   mechanisms for unicast and multicast destinations. The connectivity
   verification mechanisms SHOULD provide a means for specifying and
   carrying in the messages:

   - variable length payload/padding to test MTU related connectivity
     problems.

   - test frame formats as defined in Appendix C of [RFC2544] to detect
     potential packet corruption.

   EVPN Network OAM MUST support connectivity verification at per flow


Salam et al                                                    [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


   granularity. This includes both user flows (to test a specific path
   between PEs) as well as test flows (to test a representative path
   between PEs).

   EVPN Service OAM MUST support connectivity verification on test flows
   and MAY support connectivity verification on user flows.

   For multicast connectivity verification, EVPN Network OAM MUST
   support reporting on:

   - the DF filtering status of specific port(s) or all the ports in a
     given bridge-domain.

   - the Split Horizon filtering status of specific port(s) or all the
     ports in a given bridge-domain.



3.1.2.2 Fault Isolation

   EVPN OAM MUST support an on-demand fault localization function. This
   involves the capability to narrow down the locality of a fault to a
   particular port, link or node. The characteristic of forward/reverse
   path asymmetry, in MPLS/IP, makes fault isolation a direction-
   sensitive operation. That is, given two PEs A and B, localization of
   continuity failures between them requires running fault isolation
   procedures from PE A to PE B as well as from PE B to PE A.

   EVPN Service OAM mechanisms only have visibility to the PEs but not
   the MPLS/IP P nodes. As such, they can be used to deduce whether the
   fault is in the customer's own network, the local CE-PE segment or
   remote CE-PE segment(s). EVPN Network and Transport OAM mechanisms
   can be used for fault isolation between the PEs and P nodes.



3.2 Performance Management

   Performance Management functions can be performed both proactively
   and on-demand. Proactive management involves a recurring function,
   where the performance management probes are run continuously without
   a trigger. We cover both proactive and on-demand functions in this
   section.



3.2.1 Packet Loss

   EVPN Network OAM SHOULD provide mechanisms for measuring packet loss
   for a given service.


Salam et al                                                    [Page 15]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


   Given that EVPN provides inherent support for multipoint-to-
   multipoint connectivity, then packet loss cannot be accurately
   measured by means of counting user data packets. This is because user
   packets can be delivered to more PEs or more ports than are necessary
   (e.g., due to broadcast, un-pruned multicast or unknown unicast
   flooding). As such, a statistical means of approximating packet loss
   rate is required. This can be achieved by sending "synthetic" OAM
   packets that are counted only by those ports (MEPs) that are required
   to receive them. This provides a statistical approximation of the
   number of data frames lost, even with multipoint-to-multipoint
   connectivity.



3.2.2 Packet Delay

   EVPN Service OAM SHOULD support measurement of one-way and two-way
   packet delay and delay variation (jitter) across the EVPN network.
   Measurement of one-way delay requires clock synchronization between
   the probe source and target devices. Mechanisms for clock
   synchronization are outside the scope of this document. Note that
   Service OAM performance management mechanisms defined in [Y.1731] can
   be used.

   EVPN Network OAM MAY support measurement of one-way and two-way
   packet delay and delay variation (jitter) across the EVPN network.

INTERNET-DRAFT                           EVPN OAM Requirements/Framework


4. Security Considerations

   EVPN OAM MUST prevent OAM packets from leaking outside of the EVPN
   network or outside their corresponding Maintenance Domain. This can
   be done for CFM, for example, by having MEPs implement a filtering
   function based on the Maintenance Level associated with received OAM
   packets.

   EVPN OAM SHOULD provide mechanisms for implementation and optional
   use to:

   - Prevent denial of service attacks caused by exploitation of the OAM
     message channel (for example by forging messages to exceed a
     maintenance end point's capacity to maintain state).

   - Authenticate communicating endpoints (for example MEPs and MIPs).



5. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
