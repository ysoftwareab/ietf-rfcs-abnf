Internet-Draft     Additional Elliptic Curves for TLS       January 2014


1.  Introduction

   In [I-D.ladd-safecurves] additional elliptic curves are described
   that have performance and security advantages, of different
   strengths, for uses that may include key agreement.  The complete
   list of curves is E382, M383, Curve3617, M511, and E521.  In this
   document we refer to that list of curves informally as "additional
   curves".

   Note that Curve25519 is excluded from this document since it is
   covered in [I-D.josefsson-tls-curve25519].  These two drafts may
   eventually be merged.  Currently the Curve25519 draft is more mature
   and ready for implementation, whereas this draft is more food for
   discussion.

   [RFC4492] defines the usage of elliptic curves for authentication and
   key agreement in TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, and these mechanisms are also
   applicable to TLS 1.2 [RFC5246].  The use of ECC curves for key
   exchange requires the definition and assignment of additional
   NamedCurve IDs.  This document specify that value for the additional
   curves, as well as the minor changes in key selection and
   representation that are required to accommodate for the curves
   slightly different nature.

   This document only describes usage of additional curves for ephemeral
   key exchange (ECDHE), not for use with long-term keys embedded in
   PKIX certificates (ECDH_RSA and ECDH_ECDSA).  This is because the
   additional curves are not directly suitable for authentication with
   ECDSA, and thus not applicable for signing of e.g.  PKIX
   certificates.

2.  New NamedCurve type

   Curve negotiation is the same for the additional curves as for other
   curves, but is restricted to using the named_curve type in the
   ServerKeyEchange message: the explicit_prime type is only suited to
   curves in short Weierstrass form.  This document adds a new
   NamedCurve value for the additional curves as follows.

         enum {
              E382(TBD1),
              M383(TBD2),
              Curve3617(TBD3),
              M511(TBD4),
              E521(TBD5)
         } NamedCurve;

   The curves are suitable for use with DTLS [RFC6347].

   Since these curves are not designed to be used in signatures, clients
   who offer ECDHE_ECDSA ciphersuites and advertise support for any of
   these curves in the elliptic_curves ClientHello extension SHOULD also
   advertise support for at least one other curve, suitable for ECDSA.
   Servers MUST NOT select an ECDHE_ECDSA ciphersuite if the only common
   curve is one of these curves.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign numbers for the additional curves listed
   in Section 2 to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters
   registry EC Named Curve [IANA-TLS] as follows.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5246] and most of the security
   considerations of [RFC4492] apply accordingly.

   See also [SafeCurves] and [I-D.ladd-safecurves] for more security
   discussions.
