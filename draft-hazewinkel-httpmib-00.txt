1.  Abstract

   This draft defines a MIB to manage the HTTP protocol. The HTTP 
   protocol is used by World Wide Web applications to transfer
   information between WWW clients and WWW servers. HTTP is
   based on the request/response paradigm.
   The HTTP MIB is especially useful to manage the WWW 
   server-side. The MIB is defined in such a way that it allows
   multiple servers to run within a single system.

2.  The	SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework	consists of four major
components.  They are:

o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
     objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    RFC 1901 Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2

o    RFC 1902 Structure	of Management Information for Version 2	of
     the Simple	Network	Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1903 Textual Conventions for Version 2	of the Simple
     Network Management	Protocol (SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1904 Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple
     Network Management	Protocol (SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1907 Management Information Base for Version 2	of the
     Simple Network Management Protocol	(SNMPv2)

o    RFC 1908 Coexistence between Version 1 and	Version	2 of the
     Internet-standard Network Management Framework


The Framework permits new objects to be	defined	for the	purpose	of
experimentation	and evaluation.


2.1.  Object Definitions

Managed	objects	are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB
are defined using the subset of	Abstract Syntax	Notation One
(ASN.1)	defined	in the SMI[1]. In particular, each object type is
named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type	together with an object	instance serves	to
uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object. For
human convenience, we often use	a textual string, termed the
object descriptor, to refer to the object type.

3.  Introduction.

   The HTTP protocol instantiates the information transport in the 
   WWW application which is done with protocol entities exchanging 
   information with each other via the underlying service. 
   
   The work performed for this MIB is a result of a project performed 
   for the Centre of Earth Observations. The document should not be
   considered to be complete, but should be seen as a first step 
   towards standardization of WWW management. 
   An implementation of this MIB already exists. Due to the use of a 
   commercial development package it cannot be distributed. However, 
   a public domain version is now being developed.

4.  HyperText Transfer Protocol MIB structure

   The HTTP MIB module contains detailed network management 
   information concerning HTTP. The MIB module is divided into entity- 
   and traffic-related information.

    The HTTP MIB consists of three groups:
    1.   httpSystem,
    2.   httpStatistics, and
    3.   httpTimeOuts.

4.1. System group

   The System group consists of the httpEntityTable. This table contains
   not only basic network management information for (potentially) 
   multiple HTTP entities running on a single host machine, but also 
   entity information for virtual domains which give the physical 
   interface of the host multiple addresses. The table is indexed with 
   a unique number specifying the entity in the table which is also 
   used as index of the other tables in this MIB. For each entity the 
   following information is provided and:
    -    The protocol implemented by the entity; this value should be
         derived from the assigned number for the service; in the case
         of HTTP, this would be 80.

    -    A brief description of the entity and a contact e-mail address 
         for the person responsible.

    -    The version of the protocol implemented by the entity, the 
         producer of the software, the release version, and (optionally)
         an object identifier for the producer.

    -    Configuration information such as the address of the host 
         machine (both in text form and as an IP address), the port in 
         use, the time of last initialization, and whether the entity 
         is a client, server, proxy, or a caching proxy.

4.2. Statistics group

   The Statistics group provides network management information for the
   network traffic received and transmitted by the entity. The group
   consists of the httpSummaryTable, the httpRequestTable, and the 
   httpResponseTable. 

    -    The SummaryTable contains a set of counters for each HTTP 
         entity which provide a quick summary of the number of requests
         received, bytes transmitted, and so on. The SummaryTable also
         holds counters for Requests and Responses which have been 
         discarded or received in error. 
         However certain variables are redundant with respect to the 
         Request and Response tables, they are added to reduce network 
         traffic.

    -    The Request and Response tables provide much more detailed 
         information broken down by entity and the type of Request or 
         Response. For each entity, each type of Request or Response
         has a separate entry giving a count of the number received, 
         sent, and time stamps for the last interaction.


   These tables are not only indexed by an entityIndex pointing to an 
   entry in the httpEntityTable, but also with the Request 
   c.q. Response type. The main reason to define this in a table is
   that the MIB objects are not dependent on the protocol standard.
   Only the textual convention should be changed then new types can 
   simply be added by the implementation.

2.3. TimeOuts group

   The final group in the HTTP module contains timeout information for
   each of the HTTP entities. The information is presented in the form 
   of a table which may be resized by the Network Management System, 
   and contains the address of the remote entity and the time at which 
   the timeout occurred.

HttpStatusCode ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
	STATUS	current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The status code of an http response as defined in the 
                RFC specification. 

		The StatusCode (or reply code) is structured as a three
                digit code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the
                request.
		The following description is derived from the HyperText
		Transfer Protocol RFC:

		The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of
                response. 
		The last two digits do not have any categorization role.
                There are 5 values for the first digit:

		1xx:	Informational - Not used, but reserved for 
                        future use.
		2xx:	Success - The action was successfully received, 
                        understood, and accepted.
		3xx:	Redirection - Further action must be taken in 
                        order to complete the request.
		4xx:	Client Error - The request contains bad syntax 
                        or cannot be full filed.
		5xx:	Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an 
                        apparently valid request.

		Currently defined values for http are:
		ok(200), created(201), accepted(202), noContent(204), 
		movedPermanently(301), movedTemporarily(302), 
                notModified(304), badRequest(400), unauthorized(401),
		forbidden(403), notFound(404), internalServerError(500),
		notImplemented(501), badGateway(502),
