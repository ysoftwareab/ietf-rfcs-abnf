Abstract 

   This document discusses mechanisms for dynamic establishment of 
   bidirectional link layer connectivity of mobile nodes with 
   unidirectional links in Mobile Ipv6 (MIPv6) environment. 
   Requirements are derived from the need to support services in 
   mobile Ipv6 based on unidirectional technologies, for instance 
   Digital Video Broadcasting, using multicast protocols, such as
   Protocol Independent Multicast Routing û Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and 
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2).

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6            June 2005


   Facilities aimed to reconfigure dynamically the bidirectional 
   connectivity of mobile nodes with unidirectional links, when the 
   mobile nodes move from one IPv6 access network to another, are 
   specified considering the usage of Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanisms 
   (LLTM) in MIPv6 environment. 

   A new option for unidirectional link handling containing feed 
   information for dynamic bidirectional link establishment is defined 
   to enhance messages of MIPv6 and its complementary protocols. 
   Scenarios for integration of the proposed unidirectional link 
   handling option are described based on MIPv6 and its enhancements 
   for Fast Handovers and Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD).

1. Overview 
    
   Mobile IPv6 does not attempt to solve all general problems related 
   to the use of mobile nodes such as handling of links with 
   unidirectional connectivity [4]. 

   For the integration of technologies based on unidirectional links 
   (DVB [7], DVB-T [8]) into mobile IPv6 environment, there 
   is a need to define facilities for dynamic management of the 
   bidirectional connectivity of mobile nodes, when the mobile node 
   with the unidirectional link changes the access point and/or moves 
   from one access network to another. 

   The Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanisms (LLTM) and the Dynamic 
   Tunneling Configuration Protocol (DTCP) described in RFC 3077 
   [1] are aimed to emulate bidirectional connectivity for 
   unidirectional links in Internet. LLTM was primary defined and used 
   based on scenarios mainly including IPv4 fixed multicast services 
   over unidirectional links such as satellites [13]. 
   
   In the European project DAIDALOS [22], the usage of LLTM is

   extended for mobile IPv6 services using DVB-technologies based on 
   unidirectional links in heterogeneous wireless environment. 
   The goal is to allow efficient integration of IPv6 services and 
   protocols required for DVB, such as PIM-SM routing [18], [19],
   and Multicast Listening Discovery (MLDv2) [17]) in IPv6 
   mobile network architectures including unidirectional links. 

   In order to support dynamical bidirectional connectivity of mobile 
   nodes with unidirectional links in IPv6, this document proposes an 
   OPTIONAL facility extending IPv6 mobility protocol [4] and 
   its complementary protocols for Fast Handovers [15] and CARD [6]
   considering interoperation with LLTM [1]. 
   
   It is based on a definition of a new option for unidirectional link 
   handling of mobile nodes that COULD be integrated in MIPv6, Fast 
   Handovers and CARD protocol messages to provide efficient handover.  
   The proposed facility allows dynamically bidirectional connectivity 
   using LLTM and is RECOMMENDED for efficient support of IPv6 mobile 
   nodes with unidirectional links during their movement from one 
   access network to another. 

   This document discusses the usage of LLTM for MIPv6 and defines the 
   operational considerations for the integration of the option for 
   unidirectional link handling in MIPv6, Fast Handovers and CARD.

3. Requirements of mobile nodes with unidirectional links 
    
   Emulation of bidirectional connectivity for mobile nodes with 
   undirectional links is required to support mobile IPv6 services. 
   Bidirectional connectivity is needed for address configuration in 
   MIPv6 based on Neighbour discovery [23], dynamic stateless [24] and 
   stateful [25] mechanisms. Multicast protocols, particularly used for
   integration of DVB-T in IPv6 mobile environment, such as PIM-SM [18],
   [19] and multicast listening based on MLDv2 [17], require
   bidirectional links for their protocol messages. 

   For dynamically establishment of bidirectional connectivity based 
   on unidirectional links, dynamic LLTM protocol [1] was proposed, 
   which is adding a layer between the network interface and the routing 
   software to emulate the full bidirectional connectivity using Internet 
   tunnels. The focus of the UniDirectional Link Routing (UDLR) Working
   group was to integrate LLTM to support Internet routing and multicast 
   services on UDLs such as satellites. 

   Application of LLTM in different scenarios was studied. 
   Experiments with IGMP protocol in Ipv4 environment using LLTM are 
   reported in [14]. Configuration issues of the multicast routing 
   protocol DVMRP for UDLs based on LLTM are addressed in [12]. 
   Usage of LLTM to support Ipv4 multicast receivers connected over
   UDLs to IPv6 infrastructures is described in [13]. PIM-SM based 
   routing over satellite using LLTM is discussed in [16].
   
   This document extends the current state-of-the art of LLTM usage 
   for mobile nodes with unidirectional links adapting the LLTM 
   mechanisms to the mobile IPv6 requirements. The usage of LLTM in 
   MIPv6 environment, when the mobile node moves, depends on the 
   possibility of establishment of Internet based connections for the 
   tunnels emulating the bidirectional links.

   Figure 1: UDL topology based on "receiver" mobile nodes and feed AR 

   An example for a mobile node with "receive only" capable 
   unidirectional link in MIPv6 is the mobile terminal with DVB-T 
   reception antenna supporting Digital Video Broadcasting. 
   In this scenario, mobile nodes with "receive-only" capable UDLs are 
   considered, which MUST be in addition equipped with other 
   wireless links providing bidirectional connectivity such as UMTS, 
   WLAN (IEEE 802.11x), or IEEE 802.16-2004 promoted by the WiMAX Forum. 

   The equipment of the mobile node with additional bidirectional wireless 
   links is required for emulation of bidirectional connectivity using LLTM. 

   Before the handover, the mobile node was attached to an access point with
   unidirectional link (UDL_pAP) using the previous AR acting as Feed 
   (pAR_Feed). After the handover, the mobile node moves its attachment to 
   the next access point (UDL_nAP) using the nAR acting as Feed (nAR_Feed). 
   During the movement, it is a need to establish the bidirectional 
   connectivity to the next AR Feed (nAR_Feed) using the additional 
   bidirectional wireless link of the mobile node. 

   The handover due to a new access point for the UDL is independent on the
   handover to a nAR connected to the bidirectional wireless links. 

   The usage of LLTM requires a guarantee that the mobile node is connected

   over the additional bidirectional wireless link to the Internet and there 
   is a route available to the AR Feed connecting the node with UDL. 

   The routing and management requirements for the additional BDL interface 
   are not focus of this document. The particular goal of this document is 
   to define mechanisms in Mobile IPv6, which allow to provide efficient 
   handover based on learning of the next Care-of address for the UDL 
   interface together with the feed information to provide BDL connectivity. 

   Currently in the mobile IPv6 [4], the configuration of a new Care-of 
   address for the mobile node is defined based on the Neighbor Discovery 
   [23], stateless [24] and stateful [25] configuration, but
   the particular issues of configuration of care-of addresses for mobile 
   nodes with UDL is still not considered. It requires not only to obtain 
   information for the next Care-of Address of the UDL interface, but also 
   to get simultaneously the feed endpoints established at the next AR for
   emulation of bidirectional connectivity. 

   Further requirements are to support the same tunneling protocol and link
   layer addressing schemes at the mobile node and access router feed. 
   For this purpose the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [2] with
   Ipv6 as delivery protocol could be used. Interoperable link layer 
   addressing for the BDL emulation should be also guaranteed. 
   As it is shown in figure 2, the LLTM packet using GRE for encapsulation 
   and IPv6 as delivery protocol has the following format:

            +-------------------------------------------+
            | Delivery Header (IPv6 header)             |
            | dest address = feed_IP_addr               |
            | next header = 47 (GRE)                    |
            +-------------------------------------------+
            |       GRE Header (                        |
            | prototype=ETHER_TYPE(emulated link layer) |
            |          . . . . . . )                    |
            +-------------------------------------------|
            |      MAC header of emulated link layer    |
            |          IPv6 Encapsulated packet	        |
            +-------------------------------------------+
            Figure 2: Packet encapsulation using Ipv6 and GRE

   The destination address of the Ipv6 header is the feed tunnel end 
   point at the AR. The "next header" field of the IPv6 header is 47, 
   pointing on the IP protocol number of the GRE protocol described by 
   the following header [0]. The prototype field of GRE header 
   shows the type of the emulated BDL [21], which SHOULD be supported
   by the mobile nodes and feed ARs.

   In mobile environment, there are always requirements to reduce the 
   overhead of the mobile nodes. Therefore, the sending intervals of

INTERNET-DRAFT       Mobile nodes with UDLs in Ipv6            June 2005


   the "HELLO" messages for announcing tunnel end-points as defined in 
   Dynamic Tunneling Configuration Protocol (DTCP) should be adapted 
   for the mobile environment. 

   In order to establish bidirectional connectivity before arriving at 
   the new access network and to estabish BDL emulation at the "feed" 
   and "receivers", there is a need to advertise the "feed" information 
   of the new access router (currently sent by "HELLO" message) during 
   the handover processing using IPv6 Mobility protocols. 
   This should accelerate the services concerning dynamic address 
   configuration of mobile nodes with UDLs during the handover. 
   In particular, this document proposes to learn the AR feeds more quickly 
   based on extensions of mobile IPv6 packets with a new option for handling
   of UDLs, which contains information derived from the "HELLO" message. 

   The cause is that based on the "HELLO" messages the learning of the
   "feeds" of the mobile node with unidirectional links during the 
   handover is delayed after its attachment on the new links and that is an
   unacceptable delay for the configuration of mobile node's 
   Care-of address in IPv6.

   In summary, the requirements for handling of mobile nodes with UDLs
   using LLTM in MIPv6 are:
   -  Support of mobile nodes with unidirectional links during 
      handover for quickly care-of address configuration based on feed 
      information provided by the access routers.
   -  Adapting DTCP parameter for mobile environment based on reducing 
      the overhead to the mobile nodes.
   -  Supporting of interoperable tunneling protocol type (GRE with 
      IPv6 as delivery protocol is recommended) and link layer 
      addressing scheme for bidirectional link emulation.
   -  Management of mobile access router connectivity in order to 
      guarantee the connections using the additional bidirectional 
      wireless links to the feed ARs.

   Further requirements for unidirectional link handling could arise 
   considering specific scenarios, as for instance multicast feedback 
   implosion problem, but they are out of scope.
    
4. Definition of option for unidirectional link handling
    
   This document proposes the Unidirectional Link Handling Option for 
   mobile nodes. This is a new optional data structure, which is 
   RECOMMENDED to enhance the Mobile IPv6 messages defined in MIPv6 
   [4], Fast Handovers [15] and CARD protocol [6]. 
   This option is used to get information for the "feeds" established 
   at a new access router for the unidirectional link, to which the 
   mobile node will be attached as a result of the mobile handover.  
   The option for UDL handling of mobile Nodes COULD be included as:

   -  Additional Option in Router Advertisement Message used in Mobile 
      IPv6 [4]
   -  Additional Option in Proxy Router Advertisement Message defined 
      in Fast Handovers for MIPv6 [15]
   -  New Sub-option for usage in the Reply message format in the CARD 
      protocol [6].

   The Unidirectional Link Handling option is described by:

   -  Option Type -  To be defined by IANA.

   -  Option Length (8-bit unsigned integer) - representing the length 
      in octets of the Feed Information (FeedInfo). 
      The Feed Info includes for each Access Point Identifier the 
      established feed tunnel end-points at the access router. 
      It is defined by following descriptions:

	o UdlAP  (48 Bit)û Access Point Identifier identifying the 
          IEEE MAC address of layer 2 device offering the 
          unidirectional connectivity
	o FU_IP (128 bit)û L3 (IPv6) address of the "feed" AR to the 
          unidirectional link 
	o FU_L2 (48 bit) û L2 (MAC) address corresponding to FU_IP as 
          agreed for the bidirectional emulation of the particular 
          link.
	o Tunnel type (8 bit unsigned integer) û defined by the 
          tunneling protocol   type assigned by IANA [20]. 
          Recommended is GRE [2]. Obtaining new values for 
          tunnelling protocols is documented in [3].
        o F (1 bit) - Indicates the type of feed (send-only, receive-
          only)
	o NmbFeedInfo (4 bit unsigned integer) - Number of feed 
	  information tuples.

             - L2 (MAC) address (48 bit) of the feed tunnel end point 
               as agreed for the bidirectional emulation of 
               the particular link.

5. Operational considerations

   The option for unidirectional link handling COULD be integrated in 
   the context of Mobile IPv6, Fast Handovers MIPv6 and CARD protocols. 
   It is used at the mobile node to get during the handover the 
   bidirectional connectivity information for the unidirectional links. 
   The integration of the option for unidirectional linkhandling in 
   different message formats is described. 
    
5.1 Mobility support for Ipv6
    
   The unidirectional link handling option in the framework of MIPv6 
   [4] COULD be integrated in the "Options" Part of the Router 
   Advertisement Message [23] specified for MIPv6 [4]. 
   This allows before the configuration of a new on-link care-of-
   address of the mobile node based on the prefix included in the 
   Router Advertisement also to establish the tunnel endpoints to the 
   feed for bidirectional communication using the unidirectional links.
 
   In Mobile IPv6 routers advertise their presence using Router 
   Advertisement Messages either periodically (unsolicited) or in 
   response to Router Solicitation message sent by the Mobile Node. 
   MIPv6 specifies the requirements for sending of unsolicited Router 
   Advertisement in Mobile IP  [4].

   When a mobile node attaches to a new "receive-only" unidirectional 
   link at the first time, it cannot send Router Solicitation messages 
   as proposed in [23] to locate default routers and learn 
   prefixes more quickly. 

   It SHOULD first receive an unsolicited Router Advertisement Message 
   with Option for unidirectional link Handling. 
   
   In order to provide timely movement of mobile nodes with 
   UDLs, the "routers supporting mobility SHOULD be able to be configured
   with a smaller MinRtrAdvInterval value and MaxRtrAdvInterval value to
   allow sending of Unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements more often"
   as this is generally required in [4]. 

   After establishment of tunnel end-point for bidirectional connectivity,
   the mobile node can configure its care-of address based on: 

   -  Stateless Address Configuration [24], and/or 
   -  Stateful Address Configuration using Dynamic Host Configuration 
      [25]. 

   When the new connection is established, the mobile node can send Router
   Solicitations for specific events described in [23], such as 
   temporary loss of connection.

5.2 Fast Handovers for Ipv6
    
   IPv6 Fast Handovers has been proposed in the Internet Draft [15]
   in order to minimize the interruption in services experienced by a Mobile
   IPv6 node as it changes its point of attachment to the Internet. 

   IPv6 Fast handover is complementary to IPv6, therefore the technique
   to include Unidirectional Link Handling Option in Router Advertisement
   will be also used in the Fast Handovers protocol. 
  
   IPv6 Fast Handovers protocol integrates two strategies for mobile node
   movement called predictive and reactive handover. They are based on the
   same procedures using the Proxy Router Advertisement Message to advertise
   the next AR information for configuration of the new Care-of address for 
   the mobile node. It is sent from the previous AR to the mobile node to
   supply next access router information (AR-Info) about new access points.

   In the framework of IPv6 Fast Handovers, the UDL handling option COULD
   be included in the "option" part of the Proxy Router Advertisement
   Message (PrRtAdv). In case that the node moves to a next AR, the UDL 
   handling option will supply the feed information of the next AR for
   bidirectional connectivity establishment. 

   IPv6 Fast Handovers begins when a MN sends RtSolPr to its current 
   access router to resolve one or more Access Point Identifiers (AP-
   IDs) to subnet-specific information. 

   In response, the access router sends a PrRtAdv message, which contains
   one or more [AP-ID, AR-Info] tuples. The PrRtAdv message SHOULD include
   the UDL handling option with AR-FeedInfo for requested Access Points 
   (AP-IDs), which are based on unidirectional connectivity. 
   The new AR-FeedInfo is used to update the mobile node information for 
   BDL emulation. With the AR-Info information included in the PrRTAdv 
   message, the mobile node formulates a prospective next Care-of address
   establishing the tunnel end-points for its BDL emulation.
   Performing this, it sends: 

   -  Fast Binding Update message to the previous AR in the case of 
      "Predictive" Fast Handover

   -  Fast Binding Update message to the next AR in the case of 
      "Reactive" Fast Handover

   In case that the mobile node does not receive AR-FeedInfo for BDL
   emulation, it does not perform the binding update.
 
   The specific steps for handling of movement of mobile nodes with 
   UDLs in Fast Handovers MIPv6 are shown in figure 4:

5.3 UDL handling with CARD protocol
    
   The Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol was designed 
   to support the acquisition of information about the possible next ARs
   that are candidates for the mobile node's handover [6]. 
    
   There are different issues in optimal candidate access router 
   discovery [11].
  
   This document proposes to use CARD for the selection of a next 
   router, which supports feeds for UDLs, which are required to support
   sevices of the mobile node.

   CARD protocol is used in EU project DAIDALOS [22] together 
   with the Context Transfer protocol [5] and IPv6 Fast Handovers
   [15] for efficient handover aimed at optimization of service
   re-establishment in case of MIPv6 node handover.

   The UDL handling option could be included as sub-option in the CARD
   Reply Signalling message exchanged between access routers and mobile 
   nodes. The option is used only, when access routers are attached to UDLs
   in order to support the router selection by the mobile node. 

   The steps in usage of CARD for unidirectional link handling are 
   shown in figure 5:

6. IANA considerations
    
   IANA should record a value for Unidirectional Link Handling Option 
   (Mobile IPv6 Option).
    
7. Further work 
 
   The discussed topic of integration of unidirectional link facility 
   for mobile IPv6 networking is important for efficient handover and 
   provision of services based on unidirectional links, such as DVB 
   over satellites in IPv6 context. 

   Facilities are proposed based on usage of LLTM with extensions 
   for IPv6 mobile protocols. 
   LLTM with GRE support [2] is implemented in DAIDALOS EU project 
   in Linux for mobile Ipv6 heterogeneous networking environment in 
   interaction with Mobile IPv6, Fast Handovers IPv6 and CARD Protocol. 

   The scenarios for LLTM usage in DAIDALOS are based on DVB-T with 
   access routers acting as feeds and mobile nodes as receivers.  
   Other issues such as security and routing implications for the 
   described unidirectional link handling are topic of further work.
