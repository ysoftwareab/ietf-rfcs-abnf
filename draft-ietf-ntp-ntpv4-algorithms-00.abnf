e=sum from k=0 to k=n-1 of [esubk/2^(k+1)].

psi=[(1/(m-1))*sum from k=1 to k=m-1 of [(?subk-?sub0)^2)]]^(1/2).

T=a*sum over all i of [?subi/?subi] and psisubr=a*sum over all i of
a=1/[sum over all i of [1/?subi].

sj=[(psisubr)^2+(psisubs)^2]^(1/2).

ysubPLL = Vsubs*mu/(64Tsubc)^2.

ysubFLL = (Vsubs-x)/(8mu).

z=x/(16*Tsubc) and new phase adjustment x=x-z.  The phase increment z
