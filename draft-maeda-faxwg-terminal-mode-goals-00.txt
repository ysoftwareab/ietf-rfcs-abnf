Abstract

  This draft describes goals of Terminal Mode which was proposed 
in ITU-T SG16 meeting on November 2000 at Geneva.  The Terminal 
Mode supports the transfer of image data, capabilities exchange and 
confirmation for Store and Forward internet fax terminals having 
limited memory and small CPU power.  Terminal Mode also supports all 
features of Group 3 facsimile on the Internet using T.30 signals in 
capability exchange.

  NOTE: This is an early, preliminary version of specification,
  indicating a possible way to achieve the protocol  for Terminal Mode 
  Internet fax.  The content is rough, and
  the intent at this time is to indicate the outline of a mechanism.
  Please address comments to major structural and semantic issues.

1. Introduction
The specification defines the Terminal Mode carriage of
facsimile data over the Internet, and its functionality necessary
for achieving reliability, timeliness and capabilities negotiation for
Internet mail that is on a par with classic T.30 facsimile.

Terminal Mode is intend to implement features of all classic T.30 
facsimile over Internet, providing a level of service that approximates 
the level currently enjoyed by fax users, and providing all fax-specific 
features that will be implemented in an embedded fax device software 
working on G3 fax based system with limited memory size and CPU 
performance.  These fax specific features to be supported are Polling, 
Subaddress, Password, senders ID, Internet Selective Polling address, 
Internet Routing address and Double Side Printing, which will be easy 
to develop gateway function between G3 fax and Terminal Mode Internet 
fax.


Also new features are designed such as (1) legal support by fax header or
cover page with sender's ID and Time&date, (2) end to end SMTP session
and (3) One SMTP session for capability exchange/image 
transmission/confirmation.
