1.  Introduction

   In [RFC7748], the elliptic curves curve25519 and curve448 are
   described.  They are designed with performance and security in mind.
   The curves may be used for Diffie-Hellman and Digital Signature
   operations.

   [RFC7748] describes the operations on these curves for the Diffie-
   Hellman operation.  A convention has developed that when these two
   curves are used with the Diffie-Hellman operation, they are referred
   to as X25519 and X448.  This RFC defines the ASN.1 Object Identifiers
   (OIDs) for the operations X25519 and X448 along with the parameters.
   The use of these OIDs is described for public and private keys.

   In [RFC8032] the elliptic curve signature system Edwards-curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is described along with a
   recommendation for the use of the curve25519 and curve448.  EdDSA has
   defined two modes, the PureEdDSA mode without pre-hashing, and the
   HashEdDSA mode with pre-hashing.  The convention used for identifying
   the algorithm/curve combinations are to use the Ed25519 and Ed448 for



Josefsson & Schaad        Expires May 18, 2018                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2017


   the PureEdDSA mode.  The document does not provide the conventions
   needed for the pre-hash versions of the signature algorithm.  The use
   of the OIDs is described for public keys, private keys and
   signatures.

   [RFC8032] additionally defined the concept of a context.  Contexts
   can be used to differentiate signatures generated for different
   purposes with the same key.  The use of contexts is not defined in
   this document for the following reasons:

   o  The current implementations of Ed25519 do not support the use of
      contexts, thus if specified it will potentially delay the use of
      these algorithms further.

   o  The EdDSA algorithms are the only IETF algorithms that currently
      support the use of contexts, however there is a possibility that
      there will be confusion between which algorithms need have
      separate keys and which do not.  This may result in a decrease of
      security for those other algorithms.

   o  There are still on going discussions among the cryptographic
      community about how effective the use of contexts is for
      preventing attacks.

   o  There needs to be discussions about the correct way to identify
      when context strings are to be used.  It is not clear if different
      OIDs should be used for different contexts, or the OID should
      merely not that a context string needs to be provided.

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Curve25519 and Curve448 Algorithm Identifiers

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] can convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  This algorithm identifier is an OID
   and optionally associated parameters.

   The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included for convenience, is
   defined as follows:







Josefsson & Schaad        Expires May 18, 2018                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2017


   AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       algorithm   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
       parameters  ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL
   }

   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

   o  algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
      identifier.  This is one of the OIDs defined below.

   o  parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
      the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.  When the 1997
      syntax for AlgorithmIdentifier was initially defined, it omitted
      the OPTIONAL key word.  The optionality of the parameters field
      was later recovered via a defect report, but by then many people
      thought that the field was mandatory.  For this reason, a small
      number of implementations may still require the field to be
      present.

   In this document we defined four new OIDs for identifying the
   different curve/algorithm pairs.  The curves being curve25519 and
   curve448.  The algorithms being ECDH and EdDSA in pure mode.  For all
   of the OIDs, the parameters MUST be absent.  Regardless of the defect
   in the original 1997 syntax, implementations MUST NOT accept a
   parameters value of NULL.

   The same algorithm identifiers are used for identifying a public key,
   identifying a private key and identifying a signature (for the two
   EdDSA related OIDs).  Additional encoding information is provided
   below for each of these locations.

   id-X25519    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 110 }
   id-X448      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 111 }
   id-Ed25519   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 112 }
   id-Ed448     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 113 }

4.  Subject Public Key Fields

   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

   SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       algorithm         AlgorithmIdentifier,
       subjectPublicKey  BIT STRING
   }

   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meanings:




Josefsson & Schaad        Expires May 18, 2018                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2017


   o  algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
      public key (see above).

   o  subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.  The
      algorithms defined in this document always encode the public key
      as an exact multiple of 8-bits.

   Both [RFC7748] and [RFC8032] define the public key value as being a
   byte string.  It should be noted that the public key is computed
   differently for each of these documents, thus the same private key
   will not produce the same public key.

   The following is an example of a public key encoded using the textual
   encoding defined in [RFC7468].

   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAGb9ECWmEzf6FQbrBZ9w7lshQhqowtrbLDFw4rXAxZuE=
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

5.  Key Usage Bits

   The intended application for the key is indicated in the keyUsage
   certificate extension.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   id-X25519 or id-X448 in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following MUST
   be present:

           keyAgreement;

   one of the following MAY also be present:

             encipherOnly; or
             decipherOnly.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an end-entity certificate
   that indicates id-Ed25519 or id-Ed448, then the keyUsage extension
   MUST contain one or both of the following values:

           nonRepudiation; and
           digitalSignature.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certification authority
   certificate that indicates id-Ed25519 or id-Ed448, then the keyUsage
   extension MUST contain one or more of the following values:

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2017


          nonRepudiation;
          digitalSignature;
          keyCertSign; and
          cRLSign.

6.  EdDSA Signatures

   Signatures can be placed in a number of different ASN.1 structures.
   The top level structure for a certificate is given below as being
   illustrative of how signatures are frequently encoded with an
   algorithm identifier and a location for the signature.

      Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
           signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
           signatureValue       BIT STRING  }

   The same algorithm identifiers are used for signatures as are used
   for public keys.  When used to identify signature algorithms, the
   parameters MUST be absent.

   The data to be signed is prepared for EdDSA.  Then, a private key
   operation is performed to generate the signature value.  This value
   is the opaque value ENC(R) || ENC(S) described in section 3.3 of
   [RFC8032].  The octet string representing the signature is encoded
   directly in the BIT STRING without adding any additional ASN.1
   wrapping.  For the Certificate structure, the signature value is
   wrapped in the "signatureValue" BIT STRING field.

7.  Private Key Format

   Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958] describes how encode a private key
   in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private key is
   for, but allows for the public key and additional attributes about
   the key to be included as well.  For illustration, the ASN.1
   structure OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below.  The algorithm
   specific details of how a private key is encoded is left for the
   document describing the algorithm itself.













Josefsson & Schaad        Expires May 18, 2018                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2017


   OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      version Version,
      privateKeyAlgorithm PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
      privateKey PrivateKey,
      attributes [0] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL,
      ...,
      [[2: publicKey [1] IMPLICIT PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
      ...
   }

   PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

   PublicKey ::= BIT STRING

   For the keys defined in this document, the private key is always an
   opaque byte sequence.  The ASN.1 type CurvePrivateKey is defined in
   this document to hold the byte sequence.  Thus when encoding a
   OneAsymmetricKey object, the private key is wrapped in an
   CurvePrivateKey object and wrapped by the OCTET STRING of the
   "privateKey" field.

   CurvePrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

   To encode a EdDSA, X25519 or X448 private key, the "privateKey" field
   will hold the encoded private key.  The "privateKeyAlgorithm" field
   uses the AlgorithmIdentifier structure.  The structure is encoded as
   defined above.  If present, the "publicKey" field will hold the
   encoded key as defined in [RFC7748] and [RFC8032].

   The following is an example of a private key encoded using the
   textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   MC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEINTuctv5E1hK1bbY8fdp+K06/nwoy/HU++CXqI9EdVhC
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   The following example, in addition to encoding the private key,
   additionally has an attribute included as well as the public key.  As
   with the prior example, the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468] is
   used.

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   MHICAQEwBQYDK2VwBCIEINTuctv5E1hK1bbY8fdp+K06/nwoy/HU++CXqI9EdVhC
   oB8wHQYKKoZIhvcNAQkJFDEPDA1DdXJkbGUgQ2hhaXJzgSEAGb9ECWmEzf6FQbrB
   Z9w7lshQhqowtrbLDFw4rXAxZuE=
   -----END PRIVATE KEY------

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2017


   NOTE: There exist some private key import functions that have not
   picked up the new ASN.1 structure OneAsymmetricKey that is defined in
   [RFC7748].  This means that they will not accept a private key
   structure which contains the public key field.  This means a
   balancing act needs to be done between being able to do a consistency
   check on the key pair and widest ability to import the key.

8.  Human Readable Algorithm Names

   For the purpose of consistent cross-implementation naming this
   section establishes human readable names for the algorithms specified
   in this document.  Implementations SHOULD use these names when
   referring to the algorithms.  If there is a strong reason to deviate
   from these names -- for example, if the implementation has a
   different naming convention and wants to maintain internal
   consistency -- it is encouraged to deviate as little as possible from
   the names given here.

   Use the string "ECDH" when referring to a public key of type X25519
   or X448 when the curve is not known or relevant.

   When the curve is known, use the more specific string of X25519 or
   X448.

   Use the string "EdDSA" when referring to a signing public key or
   signature when the curve is not known or relevant.

   When the curve is known, use a more specific string.  For the id-
   Ed25519 value use the string "Ed25519".  For id-Ed448 use "Ed448".

9.  ASN.1 Module

   For reference purposes, the ASN.1 syntax is presented as an ASN.1
   module here.

13.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5280], [RFC7748], and [RFC8032]
   apply accordingly.

   The procedures for going from a private key to a public key are
   different for when used with Diffie-Hellman and when used with
   Edwards Signatures.  This means that the same public key cannot be
   used for both ECDH and EdDSA.

Appendix A.  Invalid Encodings

   There are a number of things that need to be dealt with when a new
   key part is decoded and imported into the system.  A partial list of
   these includes:

   o  ASN.1 encoding errors: Two items are highlighted here.  First, the
      use of an OCTET STRING rather than a BIT STRING for the public
      key.  This was an incorrect copy of the structure from [RFC5958]
      which was corrected before publication.  However, any early
      implementation may have this wrong.  Second, the value of the
      version field is required to be 0 if the publicKey is absent and 1
      if present.  This is called out in [RFC5958] but is not duplicated
      in the main text.

   o  Key encoding errors: Both [RFC7748] and [RFC8032] have formatting
      requirements for keys that need to be enforced.  In some cases the
      enforcement is done at the time of importing, for example doing
      masking or a mod p operation.  In other cases the enforcement is
      done by rejecting the keys and having an import failure.

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2017


   o  Key mismatch errors: If a public key is provided, it may not agree
      with the private key either because it is wrong or the wrong
      algorithm was used.

   Some systems are also going to be stricter on what they accept.  As
   stated in [RFC5958], BER decoding of OneAsymmetricKey objects is a
   requirement for compliance.  Despite this requirement, some acceptors
   will only decode DER formats.  The following is a BER encoding of a
   private key, as such is is valid, but it may not be accepted by many
   systems.

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   MIACAQAwgAYDK2VwAAAEIgQg1O5y2/kTWErVttjx92n4rTr+fCjL8dT74Jeoj0R1W
   EIAAA==
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   What follows here is a brief sampling of some incorrect keys.

   In the following example, the private key does not match the masking
   requirements for X25519.  For this example the top bits are set to
   zero and the bottom three bits are set to 001.

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   MFMCAQEwBQYDK2VuBCIEIPj///////////////////////////////////////8/oS
   MDIQCEfA0sN1I082XmYJVRh6NzWg92E9FgnTpqTYxTrqpaIg==
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   In the following examples, the key is the wrong length because an all
   zero byte has been removed.  In one case the first byte has been
   removed, in the other case the last byte has been removed.
