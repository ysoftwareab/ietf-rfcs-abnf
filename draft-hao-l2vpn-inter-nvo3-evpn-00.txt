1. Introduction

   In cloud computing era, multi-tenancy has become a core requirement
   for data centers. Since NVO3 can satisfy multi-tenancy key
   requirements, this technology is being deployed in an increasing
   number of cloud data center network. NVO3 focuses on the
   construction of overlay networks that operate over an IP (L3)
   underlay transport network. It can provide layer 2 bridging and

   layer 3 IP service for each tenant. VXLAN and NVGRE are two typical
   NVO3 technologies. NVO3 overlay network can be controlled through
   centralized NVE-NVA architecture or through distributed BGP VPN
   protocol.

   NVO3 has good scaling properties from relatively small networks to
   networks with several million tenant systems (TSs) and hundreds of
   thousands of virtual networks within a single administrative domain.
   In NVO3 network, 24-bit VN ID is used to identify different virtual
   networks, theoretically 16M virtual networks can be supported in a
   data center. In a data center network, each tenant may include one
   or more layer 2 virtual network and in normal cases each tenant
   corresponds to one routing domain (RD). Normally each layer 2
   virtual network corresponds to one or more subnets.

   To provide cloud service to external data center client, data center
   networks should be connected with WAN networks. BGP MPLS based
   Ethernet VPNs(EVPN)[EVPN] is being deployed in an increasing number
   of WAN networks. If EVPN CEs in external DC and TSs in internal DC
   belong to same subnet of same tenant, they are in same broadcast
   domain and can freely layer 2 communicate with each other in the
   broadcast domain.

   Normally internal data center and external EVPN network belongs to
   different autonomous system(AS). This requires the setting up of
   inter-as connections at Autonomous System Border Routers(ASBRs)
   between NVO3 network and external EVPN network.

   Currently, a typical connection mechanism between a data center
   network and an MPLS EVPN network is similar to Inter-AS Option-A of
   RFC4364, but it has scalability issue if there is huge number of
   tenants in data center networks. To overcome the issue, inter-as
   Option-B between NVO3 network and BGP MPLS EVPN network is proposed
   in this draft.

4. Option-A inter-as solution overview

   In Option-A inter-as solution, peering ASBRs are connected by
   multiple sub-interfaces, each ASBR acts as a PE, and thinks that the
   other ASBR is a CE. EVPN instances are configured at AS border
   routers (ASBR1 and ASBR2) so that each ASBRs associate each such
   sub-interface with a EVPN instance. It requires MAC look up on ASBRs.
   MAC address propagation for each EVPN instance between ASBR1 and
   ASBR2 relies on data plane learning mechanism. In the data-plane,
   VLANs are used for VPN traffic separation.

   Option-A inter-as solution has following issues:

   1. Up to 16 million (16M) sub-interfaces need to exist between the
      ASBRs, if there are 16M VN in NVO3 network.

   2. UP to 16M EVPN instances need to be supported on border routers.

Internet-Draft         EVPN Inter-As Option-B                July 2014


   3. Several million MAC routing entries need to be supported on
      border routers.

   Inter-as option B between NVO3 network and MPLS EVPN network can be
   used to address these issues. Due to it is for multi-as
   interconnection between heterogeneous networks, so there are some
   differences from traditional homogenous EVPN Inter-AS Option-B.

5. Inter-as option-B routing distribution process

   In option-B inter-as solution, an EBGP session is used to distribute
   labeled EVPN NLRI between the ASBRs. The advantage of this option is
   that it's more scalable, as there is no need to have one sub-
   interface per VPN between ASBRs.

   There are four Route Types in EVPN NLRI, they are Ethernet Segment
   Route, Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route, Inclusive Multicast Ethernet
   Tag Route and MAC/IP advertisement route which are used for
   Designated Forwarder Election, fast Convergence and aliasing or
   backup-path, multicast traffic handling and unicast traffic handling
   respectively.

   For inter-as option-B interconnection between EVPN and NVO3 network,
   When a ASBR receives BGP update message carrying the routes from
   peer PEs or NVEs in local AS, it should re-constructs these message
   and advertises it to peer ASBR, the Next Hop field of the
   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute should be set to a routable IP address of
   the ASBR. When the peer ASBR receives the message, the ASBR also
   should re-construct the message and advertise it to peer PEs or NVEs
   in its local AS, the Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
   also should be set to a routable IP address of the ASBR.

   In NVO3 network, there are two options for mapping the VNI to an EVI
   [EVPN-OVERLAY], one is single subnet per EVI, and another one is
   multiple subnets per EVI.

   In the following subsection, a detail explanation will be given on
   how to re-construct EVPN update message and how to generate incoming
   and outgoing forwarding table on ASBR.

5.1. Ethernet Tag ID conversion on ASBR

   A broadcast domain can be identified by different Ethernet Tag ID in
   NVO3 and MPLS EVPN network. The Ethernet Tag ID mapping relationship
   between NVO3 and MPLS EVPN network should be configured on each ASBR
   in beforehand. For example, VLAN 10 in EVPN network and VN 100 in



Hao & et,al           Expires January 4, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Inter-As Option-B                July 2014


   NVO3 network belong to same broadcast domain, NVO3 network uses 100
   as Ethernet Tag ID, EVPN network uses 10 as Ethernet Tag ID.

   When a ASBR receives BGP update message carrying EVPN NLRI from peer
   ASBR, it should replace Ethernet Tag ID field with local
   corresponding value and then advertise the message to peer PEs or
   NVEs in its local AS.

5.2. Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route process

   There are two Ethernet A-D route types, one is per ES route, and
   another one is per EVI. The "ESI Label Extended Community" MUST be
   included in the route, it is to indicate ES's redundancy mode and to
   advertise ESI Label for split-horizon filtering.

   When an ASBR in NVO3 network receives Ethernet A-D per ES route, the
   ASBR learns a ES and multi-homed NVEs correspondence, the ES's
   redundancy mode. If "Single-Active" flag in "ESI Label Extended
   Community" is set, the ES is operating in Single-Active redundancy
   mode. Otherwise, it is operating in All-Active redundancy mode. The
   Ethernet A-D per EVI route can be used for Aliasing and Backup-Path,
   aliasing is used for all-active mode, backup-path is for single-
   active mode.

   When an ASBR in NVO3 network receives Ethernet A-D per EVI route,
   the ASBR should allocate new MPLS Label and advertises it to all
   peer ASBRs in Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route MPLS Label field. In
   NVO3 network, the MPLS Label allocation principle is: If ESI is 0,
   MPLS label is allocated per NVE per VN(This is single-homed case).
   Otherwise, MPLS label is allocated per ESI per VN((This is multi-
   homed case). MPLS VPN Label and <remote NVE,VN ID> correspondence is
   used to generate incoming forwarding table on each ASBR, traffic
   forwarding from external to internal DC direction relies on the
   incoming forwarding table.

   In multi-homed scenario, when an ESI occurs link failure and lost
   connection with a NVE, the NVE should trigger ASBR in its local AS
   to mass update its local forwarding table by Ethernet A-D per ES
   route. This is called fast convergence procedure. The ASBR doesn't
   need re-allocate MPLS Label for each VN on the ESI and advertise to
   peer AS, i.e., fast convergence process is restricted to local AS,
   the Ethernet A-D route per ES doesn't need to be transmitted to peer
   AS.

   For aliasing and backup-path procedures, these procedures also don't
   need cross different AS domain, they are only restricted in local AS,



Hao & et,al           Expires January 4, 2015                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Inter-As Option-B                July 2014


   each ASBR in local AS needs to process Ethernet A-D per EVI route
   from PEs or NVEs in local AS for these procedures.

   In aliasing case, when a ASBR in NVO3 network receives traffic data
   from external DC to external DC, the traffic will be forwarded to
   all-active remote NVEs in load balancing mode. For each aliasing ES
   and VN, there is a corresponding incoming forwarding table item
   which includes one MPLS Label and multiple <NVE,VN ID> pairs on ASBR,
   the NVE is a member of remote multi-homed NVEs attaching the
   aliasing ES.

   In backup-path case, for each backup-path ES and VN, there is a
   corresponding incoming forwarding table item which includes one MPLS
   Label and one <NVE,VN ID> on ASBR, the NVE is primary NVE that
   advertises the MAC/IP advertisement route in the VN. When a ASBR
   receives first MAC/IP advertisement route from remote primary NVE,
   it will know the primary NVE and generate the incoming forwarding
   table item.

5.2.1. Optimized MPLS Label solution on ASBR

   MPLS Label consumption on ASBR is high through the above per ESI per
   VN solution, the optimized allocation solution is provided as
   follows:

   If multiple ESIs are operating in all-active mode and attached to
   the exact same set of NVEs, then these ESIs can share same MPLS
   Label for same VN to save MPLS Label space on ASBR.

   If multiple ESIs are operating in single-active mode and attached to
   the exact same set of NVEs, primary NVEs for these ESI are same NVE,
   then the VNs on these ESIs can share same MPLS Label for same VN to
   save MPLS VPN Label space on ASBR.

   In this case, if a ESI occurs link failure and lost connection with
   a NVE, the NVE advertises Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route per ES to
   each ASBR in its local AS, the ASBRs knows that the ESI is attached
   to a different set of NVEs, it should re-allocate new MPLS Labels
   for each VN on the ESI, mass update its incoming forwarding table,
   then advertise these MPLS Labels using Ethernet Auto-Discovery route
   per EVI to peer ASBR.

   When peer ASBR receives the Ethernet Auto-Discovery route per EVI,
   it allocates new MPLS Label and replaces the value in Ethernet Auto-
   Discovery Route MPLS Label field, then advertises it to all peer PEs.

Internet-Draft         EVPN Inter-As Option-B                July 2014


   Remote PEs in peer AS should update all its MAC entries with the new
   MPLS Label associated with the ESI and EVI.


5.3. Ethernet Segment Route process

   Due to this route is used for DF election and multi-homed PE or NVE
   devices won't straddle between MPLS EVPN and NVO3 network, so when a
   ASBR receives BGP update message carrying the route from peer PE or
   NVE in its own AS, it just removes it from the message, the route
   don't need to be transmitted to peer AS.

5.4. Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route process

   Similar to regular EVPN inter-as solution, when a ASBR receives from
   one of its IBGP neighbors a BGP Update message that carries the
   route, it re-advertises it to peer ASBRs and these peer ASBRs re-
   advertise it to peer PEs or NVEs in its local AS. The re-advertised
   routes MUST be the same as the original ones, except for the PMSI
   Tunnel attribute in Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route and
   Ethernet Tag ID. If ingress replication is used between ASBRs, the
   Tunnel Type in PMSI Tunnel attribute is set to Ingress Replication,
   the Leaf Information Required flag is set to 1, the PMSI Tunnel
   attribute carries no MPLS labels.

5.5. MAC/IP advertisement route process

   Because the ASBR in NVO3 network has already assigned MPLS Label for
   each ESI(or NVE in single-homed case) and each VN when it received
   Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route from remote NVEs in its local AS, so
   the ASBR receives first MAC/IP advertisement route from a <ES,VN>,
   it will search the already assigned MPLS Label for the <ES,VN>,
   generate a incoming forwarding item, fuel MPLS Label field in the
   MAC/IP advertisement route, and then send it to peer ASBR. The
   incoming forwarding table is used for traffic forwarding from
   external DC to internal DC direction.

   In above figure 1, all TSs are single-homed to a NVE, MPLS VPN Label
   is assigned per NVE per VN, the incoming forwarding table on ASBR in
   NVO3 network is as follows:

                               Incoming forwarding table


   When ASBR1 in NVO3 network receives from EBGP neighbors ASBR2 a BGP
   Update message that carries MAC/IP advertisement route, it should
   allocate VN ID per MPLS VPN Label, generate outgoing forwarding
   table, and then advertises it to peer NVEs in its local AS.

   In above figure 1, ASBR1 allocates VN ID for each VPN Label
   receiving from ASBR2, and then ASBR2 advertises the MAC/IP
   advertisement route with new allocated VN ID to each NVE (NVE1 and
   NVE2). The role of the VN ID is similar to the role of In VPN Label
   in ASBR1, it has local significance on ASBR1, each VN ID corresponds
   to each MPLS VPN Label on ASBR2; The VN ID space should be assigned
   in beforehand and should be orthogonal to the VN ID space for tenant
   identification(for example, assuming ASBR1 has local connecting TSs
   of tenant 1 to 100, VN ID 1 to 100 are allocated for these tenants,
   other VN ID other than 1 to 100 can be allocated for outgoing
   forwarding table purpose). The allocated VN ID and its corresponding
   out VPN Label forms an outgoing forwarding table which is used to
   forward NVO3 traffic from internal DC to external DC. The outgoing
   forwarding table on ASBR1 is as follows:

                        +------------------+--------------------+
                        |       VN ID      |   Out VPN Label    |
                        +------------------+--------------------+
                        |      10000       |        3000        |
                        +------------------+--------------------+
                        |      10001       |        4000        |
                        +------------------+--------------------+

6. Inter-as option-B data plane procedures

   This section describes the step by step procedures of data forward
   for either: a) internal DC to external DC data flows, or b) the
   external DC to internal DC data flows.

6.1. Internal DC to external DC direction

   1. TS1 sends traffic to NVE1, the destination MAC is CE1's MAC
      address of MAC5.

   2. NVE1 looks up MAC-VRF 1's MAC forwarding table, then it gets NVO3
      tunnel encapsulation information. The destination outer address
      is ASBR1's IP address, VN ID is 10000. NVE1 performs NVO3
      encapsulation and sends the traffic to ASBR1.

   3. ASBR1 decapsulates NVO3 encapsulation and gets VN ID 10000. Then
      it looks up outgoing forwarding table based on the VN ID and gets
      MPLS VPN label 3000. Finally it pushes MPLS VPN label for the IP
      traffic and sends it to ASBR2.

   4. ASBR2 swaps VPN Label, then sends the traffic to PE1 through IGP
      tunnel.

   5. PE1 terminates IGP tunnel, pops MPLS VPN label 3000, looks up
      local MAC-VRF 1, and then forwards the traffic to CE1.

6.2. External DC to internal DC direction

   1. CE1 sends traffic to PE1, destination MAC is TS1's MAC address of
      MAC1.

   2. PE1 looks up local MAC forwarding table in VPN-RED, pushes MPLS
      VPN label 1000, then searches IGP tunnel, then the PE sends the
      traffic to ASBR2 through IGP tunnel.

   3. ASBR2 terminates IGP tunnel, swaps MPLS VPN label, then sends the
      traffic to ASBR1.

   4. ASBR1 looks up incoming forwarding table and gets NVO3
      encapsulation, then performs NVO3 encapsulation and sends the
      traffic to NVE1. The destination outer IP is NVE1's IP, VN ID is
      10.

   5. NVE1 decapsulates NVO3 encapsulation, gets local EVPN instance 1
      relying on VN ID 10, looks up local MAC-VRF 1, then sends the
      traffic to TS1.

7. Inter-as option-B solution between PBB-EVPN network and NVO3 network

   For the further study.

8. Security Considerations

   Similar to the security considerations for inter-as Option-B in
   [RFC4364] the appropriate trust relationship must exist between NVO3
   network and MPLS EVPN network. EVPN routes in NVO3 network should
   neither be distributed to nor accepted from the public Internet, or
   from any BGP peers that are not trusted. For other general VPN
   Security Considerations, see [RFC4364].

9. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions. RFC Editor: Please remove
   this section before publication.
