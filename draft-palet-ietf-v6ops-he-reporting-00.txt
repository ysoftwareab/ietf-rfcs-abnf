1.  Introduction

   Happy Eyeballs ([RFC6555]) provides a way for improving user-visible
   delay when IPv6 connectivity is performing worst than the IPv4 one.

   However, this hides the possible IPv6 connectivity issues to the
   operator because users don't notice anything broken, so they aren't
   reporting it to their providers.

   The goal of this document is to specify an extension of HE, in order
   to use existing protocols for providing a reporting to the operator,
   which can be used to setup alarms and trigger further investigation
   so to improve.

2.  Using Syslog

   In order to simplify the reporting of the HE failures, syslog
   ([RFC5424]) over UDP ([RFC5426]), MUST be used, by means of the
   default port (514) with IPv6-only.

   The intend is to make this reporting very simple, so no choice of
   alternative ports or transport protocols is offered.

   Operators willing to use this reporting MUST configure at least one
   syslog collector at the IPv6 prefix formed as:

   Network-Specific Prefix::192.88.99.1

   The Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) MUST be chosen by the operator from
   its RIR allocated IPv6 addressing space.

   Additional collectors can be made available by using anycast at the
   NSP + 192.88.99.0/24 prefix

3.  Discovery of the syslog collector NSP

   The same mechanism described by RFC7050 ([RFC7050]) should be used to
   define the address of the syslog collector(s).

   Because the collectors will be using an IPv6 address with the 32 low
   order bits from the reserved range 192.88.99.0/24, this will not be
   in conflict with any public addresses used in Internet, so this
   mechanism is compatible with the expected usage of the NSP for NAT64.

4.  HE behaviour on failure detection

   This section will specify the exact behaviour of HE in order to
   initiate the reporting and the specific format/parameters of the HE
   failure message to be sent to the syslog collector.

   A preliminary consideration is to include, in addition to the syslog
   required parameters, the timeouts detected, the failed destination
   address and the source prefix from where the destination has failed.

   TBD.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   The goal is to provide the operator information about the failures
   detected by HE, without requiring specific users traffic information.
   Towards this, it will be sufficient to provide to the syslog
   collector details about the failed destination address and source
   prefix.  So privacy issues regarding identification of a specific
   device or user are avoided.

   TBD.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have any specific security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to reserve 192.88.99.0/24, which was previously
   released by ([RFC7526]) for this RFC.

8.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to acknowledge the inputs of TBD ...
