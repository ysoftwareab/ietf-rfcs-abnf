1.  Introduction

   There are several situations where it is useful for IS-IS routers
   within a given area to identify the routable IP address of IS-IS
   routers within the same area.  In deployments, multiple IP addresses
   can be hosted by an IS-IS router for a particular purpose and all
   these addresses cannot be represented through the currently defined
   TE Router ID TLVs [RFC5305] [RFC6119].  For example, a private
   address range used for PQ nodes, as specified in Section 12 of
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa], can be easily represented through the
   sub-TLVs defined in this document without having to parse through all
   TE reachability TLVs [RFC5305] [RFC5120] where a receiving node can
   not identify if the prefix is an external prefix, an inter-area
   leaked prefix or a locally attached prefix.  Similarly, in the case
   where a topology database is learned by an orchestrator or controller
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-problem-statement], an application can easily
   determine the router reachability from a private address range
   (specifically for this purpose), advertised through the sub-TLVs
   defined in this document.

   Meanwhile, there are also several situations where it is required for
   IS-IS routers in one area to find correlations between routable IP
   addresses and capabilities of IS-IS routers in another area.  One
   example is the Entropy Label Capability (ELC) advertisement
   [I-D.xu-isis-mpls-elc] across the IS-IS domain.  In this example,
   assume the ELC TLV originated by a router in one area is propagated
   to another area, those routers in the latter area need to find
   routable IP addresses of the router originating that ELC TLV before
   inserting the Entropy Label (EL) for packets going to the Label
   Switch Path (LSP) tunnel towards one of the above routable IP
   addresses.  Another example is the S-BFD discriminator distribution
   [I-D.ginsberg-isis-sbfd-discriminator] across the IS-IS domain.  In
   this example, assume the S-BFD Discriminator sub-TLV originated by a

   router in one area is propagated to another area, those routers in
   the latter area need to find routable IP addresses of the router
   originating that S-BFD Discriminator sub-TLV so as to set up S-BDF
   sessions with that originating router.

   However, in the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV as defined in [RFC4971],
   which is applicable for both IPv4 IS-IS [RFC1195] [RFC5305] and IPv6
   MT IS-IS [RFC5120], there is no such field for containing the
   routable IP address.  Although TE Router ID sub-TLVs defined in
   [RFC5316] can be used to carry routable IP addresses, TE Router ID
   sub-TLVs are specifically designed for TE purpose.  Therefore, this
   document propose two new sub-TLVs of this CAPABILITY TLV to carry a
   routable IPv4 and IPv6 address of the router originating the
   CAPABILITY TLV respectively.  These two sub-TLVs could be used for
   non-TE purpose.  A router MUST NOT advertise the sub-TLVs defined in
   this document if the same has been advertised through TE Router ID
   sub-TLVs.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4971].

3.  Routable IPv4 Address Sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router Capability TLV, called Routable
   IPv4 Address sub-TLV is defined to carry one or more routable /32
   IPv4 address of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  The Type
   of this sub-TLV is TBD, the Length is variable (multiple of 4), and
   the Value field contains one or more routable IPv4 address of the
   router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  For every IPv4 address of
   this type, a corresponding IP reachability TLV [RFC5305] or MT IP
   reachability TLV [RFC5120] MUST be included in its LSP.  An
   implementation receiving a Routable IPv4 Address sub-TLV defined in
   this document MUST NOT consider these /32 reachable prefixes in the
   standard SPF calculation because this can lead to forwarding loops
   when interacting with systems that do not support this TLV.

4.  Routable IPv6 Address Sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router Capability TLV, called Routable
   IPv6 Address sub-TLV is defined to carry one or more routable /128
   IPv6 global address of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.

   The Type of this sub-TLV is TBD, the Length is variable (multiple of
   16), and the Value field contains one or more routable IPv6 global
   address of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  For every IPv6
   address of this type,a corresponding IPv6 reachability TLV [RFC5308]
   orMT IPv6 reachability TLV [RFC5120] MUST be included in its LSP.  An
   implementation receiving a Routable IPv6 Address sub-TLV defined in
   this document MUST NOT consider these /128 reachable prefixes in the
   standard SPF calculation because this can lead to forwarding loops
   when interacting with systems that do not support this TLV.

   Thanks Karsten Thomann, Anton Smirnov, Joel Jaeggli, Joel M.
   Halpern, Wes George and Acee Lindem for their valuable comments on
   the initial idea of this draft.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate two sub-TLV type
   codes within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV for the Routable IPv4
   Address Sub-TLV and the Routable IPv6 Address Sub-TLV respectively.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security risk.
