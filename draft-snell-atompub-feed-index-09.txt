1.  Introduction

   In the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287], the order of entries as
   presented in a feed is typically considered to be insignificant.
   This presents a challenge when the set of entries is intended to
   represent an ordered or ranked list.  This document specifies an
   extension that allows feed publishers to establish numeric rankings
   for entries within a feed to be used as a means of organizing and
   sorting those entries.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   The XML Namespaces URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the XML
   elements and attributes described in this specification is:
     http://purl.org/syndication/rank/1.0

   In this document, the namespace prefix "r:" is used for the above
   Namespace URI.

   This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
   Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  The phrase "Information
   Item" is omitted when naming Element and Attribute Information Items.
   Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
   referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.  Likewise,
   when this specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to
   an Attribute Information Item.

   Some sections of this specification are illustrated with a non-
   normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RFC4287].  In those sections this
   specification uses the atomCommonAttributes and atomURI patterns
   defined in [RFC4287].

   However, the text of this specification provides the sole definition
   of conformance.


3.  Ranking Domains and Schemes

   A "Ranking Domain" is a uniquely identifiable logical set of entries
   with associated numeric ranking values.

   A "Ranking Scheme" identifies specific rules on how to interpret the
   numeric ranking values within one or more "Ranking Domains".

3.1.  The 'r:scheme' Element

   Ranking Schemes are defined using the r:scheme element.  A scheme
   includes zero or more r:value and r:range elements that define the
   set of possible values for the Ranking Scheme.

     rankingScheme = element r:scheme {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute name { IRI }?,
       attribute label { text }?,
       attribute significance { 'ascending' | 'descending' }?,
       ( value | range )*
     }

   The "name" attribute provides a universally unique identifier for the
   scheme in the form of an absolute IRI.

   The "label" attribute specifies a Language-Sensitive, human-readable
   label for the scheme.

   The "significance" attribute indicates how implementations are to
   interpret the significance of a numeric ranking value.  A value of
   "descending" indicates that the significance of the rank decreases as
   the numeric ranking value increases.  A value of "ascending"
   indicates that the significance of the rank increases as the numeric
   ranking value increases.  If not specified, the significance is
   considered to be "ascending".

   An Atom feed element MAY contain any number of r:scheme elements.  A
   feed MUST NOT contain more than one r:scheme element with the same
   name.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:r="http://purl.org/syndication/rank/1.0">
       ...
       <r:scheme
         name="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
         xml:lang="en-us"
         label="Five Star Reviews"
         significance="ascending">
         <r:range scale="1"
                  step="0.5"
                  minimum="0.0"
                  maximum="5.0" />
       </r:scheme>
       ...

3.1.1.  The 'r:value' and 'r:range' Elements

   A Ranking Scheme is defined by a collection of zero or more r:value
   and r:range elements that constrain the set of values considered
   significant by the Scheme.

   The value element defines a discreet decimal value.  The element's
   content value MUST NOT contain and leading or trailing whitespace.

     value = element r:value {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute label { text }?,
       attribute scale { decimal }?,
       ( decimal )
     }

   The value element is useful for defining Ranking Schemes consisting
   of a set of absolute values as in the example below,

     <r:scheme name="tag:example.org,2006:grades"
               label="Grading System"
               significance="descending">
       <r:value label="1"  scale="1">1.0</r:value>
       <r:value label="1-" scale="1">1.3</r:value>
       <r:value label="2+" scale="1">1.7</r:value>
       <r:value label="2"  scale="1">2.0</r:value>
       <r:value label="2-" scale="1">2.3</r:value>
       <r:value label="3+" scale="1">2.7</r:value>
       <r:value label="3"  scale="1">3.0</r:value>
       <r:value label="3-" scale="1">3.3</r:value>
       <r:value label="4+" scale="1">3.7</r:value>
       <r:value label="4"  scale="1">4.0</r:value>
       <r:value label="4-" scale="1">4.3</r:value>
       <r:value label="5+" scale="1">4.7</r:value>
       <r:value label="5"  scale="1">5.0</r:value>
       <r:value label="5-" scale="1">5.3</r:value>
       <r:value label="6+" scale="1">5.7</r:value>
       <r:value label="6"  scale="1">6.0</r:value>
     </r:scheme>

   The range element defines a range of decimal values that MAY be
   bounded by minimum and maximum values.

     range = element r:range {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute label { text }?,
       attribute scale { decimal }?,
       attribute step { decimal }?,
       attribute origin { decimal }?,
       attribute minimum { decimal }?,
       attribute maximum { decimal }?,
       ( undefinedContent )
     }

   For example,

     <r:scheme name="tag:example.org,2006:grades"
               label="Percentage Grading System"
               significance="ascending">

       <r:range label="D"
                minimum="0.60"
                maximum="0.69"
                scale="2"
                step="0.01" />
       <r:range label="C"
                minimum="0.70"
                maximum="0.79"
                scale="2"
                step="0.01" />
       <r:range label="B"
                minimum="0.80"
                maximum="0.89"
                scale="2"
                step="0.01" />
       <r:range label="A"
                minimum="0.90"
                maximum="0.99"
                scale="2"
                step="0.01" />
       <r:value label="A+"
                scale="2">1.00</r:value>
     </r:scheme>

   The "scale" attribute on both the value and range elements specifies
   the total number of decimal digits to the right of the decimal
   indicator in the value of the numeric ranking value.  The scale is



Snell & Sewe             Expires October 3, 2006                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  Atom Rank                     April 2006


   expressed as a non-negative integer.  If not specified, the value is
   considered to be zero.  Ranking Schemes that are based on fractional
   numeric ranking values SHOULD specify a scale.  Numeric ranking
   values that use a larger scale than defined for the scheme MUST be
   rounded to the nearest in-scale value (e.g. with scale=2, the rank
   0.123 is rounded down to 0.12, the rank 0.125 is rounded up to 0.13.)

   The "step" attribute specifies the minimum significant increment for
   numeric ranking values within a given range.  For instance, if a
   range is based on full and half values (e.g. 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
   etc), the step attribute value would be 0.5.  If not specified, no
   significant increment is considered to apply.  When compared with
   other numeric rankings, values that do not precisely match the
   pattern specified by the step attribute MUST be rounded to the
   nearest least-significant increment.  For example, if the Scheme's
   significance is ascending and step equals 0.50, the value 1.45 is
   equivalent to 1.00; if significance is descending, the value is
   equivalent to 1.50.

   The "origin" attribute specifies the base from which steps in a range
   are to be calculated.  For instance, given a fractional Ranking
   Scheme where step=0.5 and no minimum or maximum value, the Scheme may
   specify 0.0 as the step origin, resulting in a set of rankings
   calculated relative to the value 0.0 (e.g. ..., -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5,
   1.0, ...).  The origin MUST be specified if step is specified and
   either a) significance is ascending and no minimum is defined, or b)
   significance is descending and no maximum is defined.

   The "minumum" attribute specifies the lowest possible value for a
   range (inclusive).  If not specified, no minimum value is considered
   to apply.

   The "maximum" attribute specifies the highest possible value for a
   range (inclusive).  If not specified, no maximum value is considered
   to apply.

   Ranges and values defined within a Scheme MUST NOT overlap one
   another.

3.2.  The 'r:rank' Element

   Numeric rankings are specified using the "r:rank" element.

Internet-Draft                  Atom Rank                     April 2006


    rankingValue = element r:rank {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute domain { IRI }?,
       attribute scheme { IRI }?,
       attribute label { text }?,
       { decimal }
     }

   The "domain" attribute identifies the Ranking Domain containing the
   entry.  See "Ranking Domain Scope" for details.

   The "scheme" attribute identifies the Ranking Scheme.  If not
   specified, the scheme is assumed to be the Default Ranking Scheme.

   The "label" attribute provides a Language-Sensitive, human readable
   label for the ranking value.

   The value of the r:rank is a decimal value conforming to the XML
   Schema decimal data type [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].  The value
   MUST NOT contain any leading or trailing whitespace.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:r="http://purl.org/syndication/rank/1.0">
       ...
       <entry>
         ...
         <r:rank
           domain="http://example.org/movie_reviews"

           label="Good">3.5</r:rank>
       </entry>
     </feed>

   Entries MAY contain zero or more r:rank elements.  An entry MUST NOT
   contain more than one r:rank element with the same combination of
   domain and scheme IRI identities.

   The following, for example, is invalid because both rankings exist in
   the same Ranking Domain and use the same Ranking Scheme.


    <r:rank xml:base="http://example.com/feed/base"
       domain=""
       scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good" >3.5</r:rank>
    <r:rank

       label="Bad" >1.5</r:rank>


4.  Ranking Domain Scope

   Ranking Domains group entries with attached numeric ranking values to
   logical sets.  Ranking Domains are uniquely identified by IRIs.

   Ranking Domains fall into one of three scopes:
   o  Feed Scope (known as the "Feed Ranking Domain")
   o  Document Scope (known as the "Document Ranking Domain")
   o  Domain Scope

   Numeric ranking values that do not specify a domain attribute are
   associated with the Feed Ranking Domain.  The IRI identity of the
   Feed Ranking Domain is the same as the containing feed element's
   atom:id element.

   A numeric ranking associated with the Feed Ranking Domain

     <r:rank
       scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good" >3.5</r:rank>

   The set of entries contained within the Feed Ranking Domain is
   limited to the set of entries contained within the feed.

   Numeric rankings that specify a domain equal or equivalent to the in-
   scope Base URI are associated with a Document Ranking Domain
   identified by the in-scope Base URI.

   A numeric ranking associated with the Document Ranking Domain

     <r:rank
       domain=""
       scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good">3.5</r:rank>

   The set of entries contained within the Document Ranking Domain is
   limited to the set of entries contained within the Document
   identified by the Base URI.

   Numeric ranking values that specify any IRI value other than the Base
   URI of the containing document and the atom:id of the containing feed
   are associated with a Domain Scope.

   A numeric ranking associated with the Feed Ranking Domain

     <r:rank
       domain="http://www.example.org/movie_reviews"
       scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good">3.5</r:rank>

   Domain Scopes SHOULD be considered open sets consistings of entries
   from any number of feeds.

4.1.  Base URIs and the Document Ranking Domain

   When specifying or processing rankings in the Document Ranking
   Domain, implementors need to be aware of the the impact the
   document's Base URI has on the Domain's set of entries.

   For instance, in the example,

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xml:base="http://example.org/feed.xml" ...>
       ...
       <entry>
         <id>tag:example.org,2005:1</id>
         <r:rank
           domain=""
           scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
           label="Good">3.5</r:rank>
         ...
       </enry>
       <entry xml:base="http://example.com/anotherfeed.xml">
         <id>tag:example.com,2005:1</id>
         <r:rank
           domain=""
           scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
           label="Good">3.5</r:rank>
         ...
       </enry>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:example.com,2005:2</id>
         <r:rank
           domain="http://example.org/anotherfeed.xml"
           scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
           label="Good">3.5</r:rank>
         ...
       </enry>
     </feed>

   The three entries contained by the feed exist in two separate

Internet-Draft                  Atom Rank                     April 2006


   Document Ranking Domains, each respectively identified by the URIs
   "http://example.org/feed.xml" and
   "http://example.com/anotherfeed.xml".

   It is posible for the set of entries within a Document Ranking Domain
   to span multiple Atom Feed Documents if those documents share the
   same Base URI as specified by mechanisms such as xml:base or the
   Content-Location HTTP header.


5.  Ranking Domain and Scheme Identifiers

   The IRIs identifying Ranking Domains and Ranking Schemes are subject
   to the same construction and comparison rules as the atom:id element.

   Comparison's of domain and scheme identifiers MUST be performed on a
   case-sensitive, character-by-character basis solely on the IRI
   character strings and MUST NOT rely on dereferencing the IRIs or URIs
   mapped from them.


6.  Processing Rankings

   Processing a Ranking Domain to produce an ordered set involves the
   following steps:
   o  Select the Ranking Scheme.
   o  Identify the Ranking Domain
   o  Identify the available set of entries containing numeric ranking
      values within the identified Ranking Domain using the selected
      Ranking Scheme.
   o  Remove from the set all entries whose rankings fall outside the
      minimum and maximum values set by the selected Ranking Scheme.
   o  Sort the remaining set of ranked entries according to the
      significance and step of the numeric ranking as defined by the
      Ranking Scheme.


7.  Default Ranking Scheme

   Feeds MAY contain ranked entries that have no specified scheme.  In
   such cases the Default Ranking Scheme should be applied.

   The Default Ranking Scheme assumes ascending significance and a
   single range with no minimum or maximum value, no significant step,
   unspecified scale, and an origin of 0.

8.  Well-Known Ranking Schemes

   Feeds MAY contain ranked entries whose ranking scheme cannot be
   resolved (i.e., no r:scheme with a "name" attribute matching the
   rankings "scheme" attribute can be found).  In such cases software
   implementations MAY attempt to match such rankings to well-known
   schemes.  For instance, an online search engine may choose to define
   a ranking scheme that is reflective of the relevance of a given
   result to a search query; rather than require that a r:scheme element
   be included in every feed where the Ranking Scheme may be used, the
   search engine may separately publish its Ranking Scheme and
   associated Ranking Domain.  (The format of such a publication is
   beyond the scope of this specification.)

   A hypothetical search engine ranking using a well-known scheme

     <r:rank scheme="http://search.example.org/relevance">5</r:rank>

   If a Ranking Scheme cannot be resolved this way (e.g., no r:scheme
   with a matching "name" attribute can be found and the scheme is not
   well-known), the Default Ranking Scheme should be applied.

   Further, it is possible that a processor may resolve multiple Ranking
   Schemes for a given Ranking.  For instance, a feed may contain an
   "r:scheme" that redefines a scheme well-known to the processor.  In
   such cases, processors should issue a warning to the user.


9.  Example

   In the following example, numeric rankings are used to establish a
   simple ordering for entries within a feed and to specify an average
   customer review rating for each of the movies listed.  The former are
   scoped to the document in which the entries appear, while the latter
   are scoped to a specific domain.

10.  Security Considerations

   Because this specification defines an extension to the Atom
   Syndication Format [RFC4287], it is subject to the same security
   consideration as defined in section 8 of that specification.


11.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this specification.
