Internet-Draft           Virtual P2P Tracker              October 2009


Abstract

   This document describes the virtual P2P tracker mechanism for ALTO
   clients that are embedded in P2P clients, not P2P tracker. An ALTO
   server does significant role that is collecting ISP's network
   information, and responding ALTO clients' queries of ALTO guidance.
   With this mechanism, ALTO server or P2P clients can reduce the load
   for selection of the list of optimized peers even if any P2P tracker
   isn't included in the P2P application.

1. Introduction

   As discussed in the ALTO problem statement [draft-ietf-alto-problem-
   statement], traffic occurred by Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications
   occupies a large portion of network capacity in the Internet. P2P
   application selects its peers regardless of underlying information of
   network topology. As a result, P2P application traffic is easy to
   cross among different ISPs' networks in multiple times. This
   increases network load and reduces the performance of P2P
   applications.

   To resolve this problem, an ALTO server manages the network topology
   information of one or more ISPs, and P2P trackers of P2P applications
   use it for selecting lists of peers for the P2P clients that want to
   select peers. By this, much of P2P traffic will be able to be
   localized into fewer ISPs' networks.

   But some P2P applications form full-distributed P2P architecture.
   They manage peer lists with distributed information like distributed
   hash tables (DHT) or peer exchange (PEX). In this case, instead of
   P2P tracker, P2P clients embeds ALTO client in themselves. They send
   requests and receive network/link cost information from/to ALTO
   server, and select peers from these information.

   Alternatively, each P2P client sends its own peer list to ALTO server.
   And next, ALTO server ranks what peers are good for the P2P client.
   In this method, ALTO server is highly loaded for ranking peers
   [draft-penno-alto-protocol].

   This document describes the mechanism of using ALTO server and P2P
   clients as virtual P2P tracker. By this, the load of ALTO server and
   P2P clients is reduced. And this mechanism can use with ALTO protocol
   [draft-penno-alto-protocol] at the same time.

2. Virtual P2P Tracker Mechanism

2.1. P2P Client with ALTO Client

   According to use cases from [draft-penno-alto-protocol], if ALTO
   client is not embedded into P2P tracker, each P2P client manages
   network map and cost map, and its own list of other peers. The ALTO
   server has to provide network information to all peers that send ALTO
   queries. As the number of P2P clients is increased, ALTO server's
   scalability problem gets more significant.

   In other way, P2P clients just manage the list of peers along their
   own P2P protocol mechanisms like distributed hash table (DHT), or
   peer exchange (PEX). If the client wants to select the peers along
   its network information from ISP, it queries to an ALTO server with
   the list of peers. The ALTO server ranks to each peer in the list,
   and then returns to the client with the ranked peers list. This
   method does not require ISP's network information to every P2P client.
   But the ALTO server's processing overhead is increased for rank-
   calculation every time each P2P client sends its peer list.

2.2. PID Head

   To avoid the overhead of every P2P client, it is possible that some
   P2P clients are elected from each PID as PID Heads. The role of PID
   Head is to manage the network map and cost map of the PID instead of
   all P2P clients. These PID Heads act as P2P trackers that embeds ALTO
   client to other P2P clients of same PID. These PID Heads become
   `virtual P2P tracker'.

   In example, if a PID Head is the member of PID1, the PID Head manages
   the list of endpoints consisting of PID1 and its network map and cost
   map. If another P2P client queries PID1 to ALTO server, it forwards
   the query to the PID Head. Then the head answers back to the ALTO
   server. Finally, the response is forwarded to the P2P client.
   Otherwise, the query is other than PID1, it is forwarded to other
   ALTO servers or other PID Heads.

2.3. PID Head Election

   Issues related with PID Head is that who elects some P2P clients as
   PID Heads, and what conditions are required to be elected to PID Head.

   P2P clients of each PID can elect its own PID Header. Some super P2P
   clients can become PID Head. But to do this, all P2P clients of that
   PID must formerly know everything about other P2P clients. To collect
   the others' information, more signaling steps and more memory
   capacity is required for all P2P clients.

   To resolve this, ALTO server can elects PID Head for each PID. To
   simplify the decision policy, the ALTO server can elect first P2P
   client sending queries in targeted PID.

   Those are some of conditions to be elected as PID Head in example:

   O CPU clock speed (Hz)

   O memory footprint

   O max. continuous lifetime

   O distance between the node and ALTO server



3. Security Considerations

   High-level security considerations can be found in the [draft-ietf-
   alto-problem-statement].
