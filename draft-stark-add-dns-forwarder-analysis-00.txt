       Analysis of DNS Forwarder Scenario Relative to DDR and DNR
               draft-stark-add-dns-forwarder-analysis-00

Abstract

   This draft analyzes the behaviors that residential end users and home
   network owners (e.g., parents of young children) might experience
   when operating systems and clients support [I-D.ietf-add-ddr] and/or
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] for discovery of encrypted DNS services and the CE
   router of the home network offers itself as the Do53 resolver.  This
   use case is explicitly mentioned in [I-D.ietf-add-requirements]
   Section 3.2 and has several requirements related to it.  This draft
   has two goals: determine if the analysis it provides is accurate and,
   if it is accurate, determine if the behavior is acceptable to the WG
   or if there should be changes to either of the discovery mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   This draft analyzes the behaviors that residential end users and home
   network owners (e.g., parents of young children) might experience
   when operating systems and clients support [I-D.ietf-add-ddr] and/or
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] for discovery of encrypted DNS services and the CE
   router of the home network offers itself as the Do53 resolver.  This
   use case is explicitly mentioned in [I-D.ietf-add-requirements]
   Section 3.2 and has several requirements related to it.

   This draft has two goals:

   *  determine if the analysis it provides is accurate

   *  if it is accurate, determine if the behavior is acceptable to the
      WG or if there should be changes to either of the discovery
      mechanisms.

   Becoming a WG draft is _not_ a goal of this draft.  There is and will
   be no request for adoption by any WG.

   While DNS forwarders / proxies may exist in environments other than
   home networks (e.g., hotspots, small businesses), this draft does not
   attempt to examine those usages.  This draft is focused on home
   networks.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background

   Having a DNS forwarder in the CE router that is advertised to the LAN
   using DHCP and RDNSS options is a common deployment model for many
   ISPs and is also the default in many retail consumer routers (e.g.,
   Netgear).

   [I-D.ietf-add-requirements] contains the following text related to
   this use case:

   "Many networks offer a Do53 resolver on an address that is not
   globally meaningful, e.g.  [RFC1918], link-local or unique local
   addresses.  To support the discovery of encrypted DNS in these
   environments, a means is needed for the discovery process to work
   from a locally-addressed Do53 resolver to an encrypted DNS resolver
   that is accessible either at the same (local) address, or at a
   different global address.  Both options need to be supported."

   "R4.1 If the local network resolver is a forwarder that does not
   offer encrypted DNS service, an upstream encrypted resolver SHOULD be
   retrievable via queries sent to that forwarder."

   "R4.2 Achieving requirement 4.1 SHOULD NOT require any changes to DNS
   forwarders hosted on non-upgradable legacy network devices."

   In the context of a home network, there are several reasons why this
   deployment model is used.  Some reasons are:

   *  Provide local name resolution

   *  Captive portal (Note that [RFC8952] defines an architecture that
      does not rely on "breaking" DNS; however, there exist many legacy
      devices with captive portals that do rely on "breaking" DNS.}

   *  Provide filtering (aka parental controls) and DNS-based
      vulnerability assessment in the CE router.  Note that
      [I-D.ietf-add-requirements] describes this sort of filtering and
      monitoring behavior as an attack; nonetheless, this functionality
      is popular with many people -- especially parents.

   *  Caching responses to improve DNS performance

4.  Scenario Analysis

   The following sections will analyze what behavior a user is expected
   to see when certain conditions exist.  In all cases, it's assumed the
   CE router is advertising itself as the Do53 server (using DHCP and/or
   RA).  The clients and OSs that are of interest in these scenarios are
   using whatever Do53 server is advertised to them by DHCP/RA.  There
   may be clients and devices that use other Do53 servers; those are out
   of scope of this analysis.  Analyzing the behavior of clients that do
   not support either DoH or DoT, or do not support any mechanism to
   discover encrypted servers are also out of scope.

   Assumptions common to all scenarios are:

   *  Common OSs support both DNR and DDR

   *  Some applications (e.g., browsers) support DDR

   *  No Certificate Authority will sign a certificate with a private IP
      address in a SAN

4.1.  Scenario 1: No changes to CE router

   Assumptions:

   *  The CE router (including its DNS forwarder and DHCP/RA
      capabilities) are not updated.

   Expected behaviors:

   *  There will be no DHCP or RA advertisement of encrypted servers.

Internet-Draft     Analysis of DNS Forwarder Scenario          June 2021


   *  The DNS forwarder will forward DDR queries (dns://resolver.arpa)
      to the DNS recursive resolver the CE router is configured to use.

   *  If that recursive resolver has the appropriate SVCB record, it
      will provide that in the response that is returned.

   *  The querying OS/app will determine that the IP address of its
      Unencrypted Resolver (the CE router) and the IP address of the
      Unencrypted Resolver in the supplied certificate do not match and
      will not do "authenticated discovery".

   *  The querying OS/app will determine that the IP address of its
      Unencrypted Resolver (the CE router) does not match the IP address
      of the Encrypted Resolver and will not do "opportunistic
      discovery".

   *  The OS/app will not discover a local Encrypted Resolver.

   The end result is that no Encrypted Resolver will be used by an OS or
   app that uses DDR or DNR to discover an Encrypted Resolver, unless
   the OS or app subsequently uses some non-standard mechanism to select
   an Encrypted Resolver.  Note that this suggests that the DDR and DNR
   proposals in their current form do not satisfy the requirement "R4.2
   Achieving requirement 4.1 SHOULD NOT require any changes to DNS
   forwarders hosted on non-upgradable legacy network devices."

   Also note that non-upgraded legacy routers will not satisfy the
   [I-D.ietf-add-ddr] requirement that a "DNS forwarder SHOULD NOT
   forward queries for "resolver.arpa" upstream."  If the CE router were
   updated to not forward queries for "resolver.arpa" upstream, the end
   result would not change.  Since this scenario provides the same end
   result, it isn't broken out separately.

4.2.  Scenario 2: CE router updated to provide DNR in DHCP/RA

   Assumptions:

   *  The CE router is updated to provide Encrypted Resolver info in
      DHCP/RA

   *  The CE router gets its Encrypted Resolver info from DHCP; getting
      that was part of the update

   *  The upstream ISP has updated its core network resolver to support
      encryption, and announces this resolver in DHCP

   Expected behaviors:

Internet-Draft     Analysis of DNS Forwarder Scenario          June 2021


   *  OSs will use the Encrypted Resolver

   *  Applications that try "resolver.arpa" will not do their own
      upgrade, because that will fail

   Additional results:

   *  Local name resolution is broken?

   *  Legacy captive portal is now broken?

   *  Filtering in the CE router (parental controls and other security
      mechanisms enabled by the home network owner) is now broken

   *  Any filtering deployed in the core network resolver continues to
      operate

   *  No local caching

4.3.  Scenario 3: CE router updated to support opportunistic encryption
      to its DNS forwarder

   Assumptions:

   *  The CE router supports encrypted connectivity to its DNS forwarder

   *  The CE router is updated to provide Encrypted Resolver info in
      DHCP/RA

   *  The CE router is updated to reply to "dns://resolver.arpa"; SVCB
      record points to the CE router with a self-signed certificate

   Note that the effort do do these upgrades is considered to be rather
   large.

   Expected behaviors:

   *  Some OSs and applications accept DDR Opportunistic Discovery,
      resulting in use of the CE router's Encrypted Resolver.

   *  Some OSs and applications do not.

   *  Across a range of households, and even within a single household,
      there is inconsistent behavior.

5.  Conclusions

   Since Scenario 3 is considered a large effort and the resulting
   behavior is unpredictable, it is unlikely to be pursued.

   Since Scenario 2 will break some of the functionality that a
   significant number of home network owners have purposefully enabled
   (e.g., router-based DNS-based parental controls), will break existing
   captive portal implementations used to simplify setup of broadband
   connections, and may break local name resolution (?) it is unlikely
   to be pursued.

   This leaves Scenario 1 (do nothing in routers that provide DNS
   forwarder).

6.  Questions for the WG

   Are these the results we want to achieve with Encrypted Resolver
   discovery mechanisms?

7.  Security Considerations

   Breaking the security mechanisms that many users currently have
   enabled in their home network routers (e.g., DNS filtering) will
   worsen the security of those users.  While these mehanisms are not
   perfect, and can easily be bypassed by client applications that run
   DoH, this does not make them completely useless.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
