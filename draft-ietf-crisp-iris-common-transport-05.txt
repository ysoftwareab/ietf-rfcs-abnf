Abstract

   This document describes an XML Schema for use by Internet Registry
   Information Service (IRIS) application transfer protocols that share
   common characteristics.  It describes common information about the
   transfer protocol, such as version, supported extensions, and
   supported security mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   IRIS [8] has two transfer protocols, LWZ [9] and XPC [10], that share
   common negotiation mechanisms.  Both transfer protocols have a need
   for the server to provide rich status information to clients during
   protocol negotiation.  In many cases, this status information would
   be too complex to describe using simple bit fields and length-
   specifed octet sequences.  This document defines an XML Schema for
   this rich status information and describes the usage of comforant XML
   for conveying this status information.

   This document defines five types of information used in the
   negotiation of protocol capabilities: version, size, authentication
   success, authentication failure, and other information.  The version
   information is used to negotiate the versions and extensions to the
   transfer protocol, the application operations protocol, and data
   models used by the application operations.  Size information is used
   to indicate request and response size capabilities and errors.
   Authentication failure and success information is used to indicate
   the outcome of an authentication action.  Other types of information
   may also be conveyed that is generally a result of an error but
   cannot be corrected through defined protocol behavior.

   As an example, upon initiation of a connection, a server may send
   version information informing the client the data models supported by
   the server and the security mechanims supported by the server.  The
   client may then respond appropriately.  For example, the client may
   not recognize any of the data models supported by the server, and
   thefore close the connection.  On the other hand, the client may
   recognize the data models and the security mechanisms and begin the
   procedure to initialize a security mechanism with the server before
   proceeding to query data according to a recognized data model.

   Both LWZ [9] and XPC [10] provide examples of the usage of the XML
   Schema defined in this document.

4.  Version Information

   The <versions> element is used to describe version information about
   the transfer protocol, the application protocol, and data models used
   by the application protocol.

   The <versions> element has one or more <transferProtocol> child
   elements. <transferProtocol> elements have zero or more <application>
   child elements.  And <application> elements have zero or more
   <dataModel> elements.  Each of these element types has a 'protocolId'
   attribute identifying the protocol they represent and an optional
   'extensionIds' attribute identifying the protocol extensions they
   support.

   During capabilities negotiation, it is expected that both sides of
   the negotiation recognize the 'protocolId' value of the
   <transferProtocol> element and at least one of the <application> and
   <dataModel> elements.  If the negotiation produces a situation where
   this is not possible, an error SHOULD be given and communication
   ended.  It is not expected that each side must recognize the
   'extensionIds' values, and unrecognized 'extensionIds' values MUST be
   ignored.

   Additionally, the <transferProtocol> element has optional
   'authenticationIds', 'responseSizeOctets', and 'requestSizeOctets'
   attributes.  The 'authenticationIds' attribute identifies
   authentication mechanisms supported by the associated transfer
   protocol.  The 'responseSizeOctets' attribute describes the maximum
   response size in octets the server will give.  The
   'requestSizeOctets' attribute describes the maximum request size in
   octets the server will accept.

   The protocol, extension, and authentication mechanism identifiers are
   of no specific type, and this document defines none.  Specifications
   using this XML Schema MUST define the identifers for use with the
   <versions> element and its children.

   The meaning of octets for the transfer of data is counted in
   different ways for different transfer protocols.  Some transfer
   protocols need only to specify the octets of the data being
   transfered while other transfer protocols need to account for
   additional octets used to transfer the data.  Specifications using
   this XML Schema MUST describe how these octet counts are calculated.

   The following is example XML describing version information.

5.  Size Information

   The <size> element provides a means for a server to communicate to a
   client that a given request has exceeded a negotiated size
   (<request>) or that a response to a given request will exceed a
   negotiated size (<response>).

   A server may indicate one of two size conditions by specifying the
   following child elements:

      <exceedsMaximum> - this child element simply indicates that the
      size exceeded the negotiated size.

      <octets> - this child element indicates that the size exceeded the
      negotiated size and conveys the number of octets that is the
      maximum for a request if the parent element is a <request> element
      or the number of octets needed to provide the response if the
      parent element is a <response> element.

   The meaning of octets for the transfer of data is counted in
   different ways for different transfer protocols.  Some transfer
   protocols need only to specify the octets of the data being
   transfered while other transfer protocols need to account for
   additional octets used to transfer the data.  Specifications using
   this XML Schema MUST describe how these octet counts are calculated.

   The following is example XML describing size information.

   <size xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iris-transport">
     <response>
       <octets>1211</octets>
     </response>
   </size>

6.  Authentication Success Information

   The <authenticationSuccess> element indicates that a client has
   successfully authenticated to a server.  Along with this indication,
   it can provide text that may be presented to a user with regard to
   this successful authentication using child <description> elements.

   Each <description> element MUST have a 'language' attribute
   describing the language of the content of the <description> element.
   Clients are not expected to concatenate multiple descriptions,
   therefore servers MUST NOT provide multiple <description> elements
   with the same language descriptor.

   Finally, additional security data may be sent back with the
   authentication sucess message using the <data> element.  The content
   of this element is of the base64Binary simple type.

   The following is example XML describing authentication success
   information.

   <authenticationSuccess
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iris-transport">
     <description language="en">
       user 'bob' authenticates via password
     </description>
   </authenticationSuccess>

7.  Authentication Failure Information

   The <authenticationFailure> element indicates that a client has
   failed to properly authenticate to a server.  Along with this
   indication, it can provide text that may be presented to a user with
   regard to this authentication failure using child <description>
   elements.

   Each <description> element MUST have a 'language' attribute
   describing the language of the content of the <description> element.
   Clients are not expected to concatenate multiple descriptions,
   therefore servers MUST NOT provide multiple <description> elements
   with the same language descriptor.

   The following is example XML describing authentication failure
   information.

   <authenticationFailure
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iris-transport">
     <description language="en">
       please consult your admin if you have forgotten your password
     </description>
   </authenticationFailure>

8.  Other Information

   The <other> element conveys status information that may require
   interpretation by a human to be meaningful.  This element has a
   required 'type' attribute which contains an identifier regarding the
   nature of the information.  This document does not define any
   identifiers for use in this attribute, but the intent is that these
   identifiers are well-known so that clients may take different classes
   of action based on the content of this attribute.  Therefore,
   specifications making use of this XML Schema MUST define these
   identifiers.

   The <other> element may have zero or more <description> elements.
   Each <description> element MUST have a 'language' attribute
   describing the language of the content of the <description> element.
   Servers may use these child elements to convey textual information to
   clients regarding the class (or type) of status information being
   specified by the <other> element.  Clients are not expected to
   concatenate multiple descriptions, therefore servers MUST NOT provide
   multiple <description> elements with the same language descriptor.

   The following is example XML describing other information.

   <other xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iris-transport" type="system">
     <description language="en">unavailable, come back
       later</description>
   </other>

9.  Internationalization Considerations

   XML processors are obliged to recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16 [1]
   encodings.  XML provides for mechanisms to identify and use other
   character encodings.  Application transfer protocols MUST define
   which additional character encodings, if any, are to be allowed in
   the use of the XML defined in this document.

11.  Security Considerations

   Transfer protocols using XML conformant to the XML Schema in this
   document and offering security properties such as authentication and
   confidentiality SHOULD offer an initial message from the server to
   the client using the <version> element.  This <version> element
   SHOULD contain all relevant authentication identifiers in its
   'autheticationId' attribute.  The purpose of providing this initial
   message is to help thwart downgrade attacks.
