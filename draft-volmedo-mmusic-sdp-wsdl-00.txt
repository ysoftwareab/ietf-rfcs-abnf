Abstract

   This document defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-
   level attribute: 'wsdl'.  The 'wsdl' attribute allows for a user
   running Web Services to let a potential client know the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) where the Web Service Description Language
   file (WSDL) describing the service can be obtained.  The WSDL file
   describes the public interface offered by the Web Service and allows
   the client to consume the service.  It also defines the SDP proto
   value 'TCP/HTTP', needed for this type of communication.

1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [1] is a protocol usually
   intended to describe multimedia sessions, most typically used with
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [9].  This combination allows
   the establishment and management of multimedia sessions with nomadic
   and mobile users who can be connected from heterogeneous devices.

   Currently, massive usage of nomadic and mobile devices has pushed for
   these devices hosting also other kind of applications and services,
   not always related to multimedia.  Specifically, Web Service-based
   applications are one of the most popular services nowadays under the
   so-called Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

   SDP is generic in order to describe different types of sessions.
   However, these sessions may need some specific session-related
   attributes for its establishment.  This is the case of Web Service
   sessions, where the requestor needs to access the description of the
   offered services, specified in a Web Service Description Language
   (WSDL) document.

   This specification defines the SDP 'wsdl' media-level attribute,
   which provides the requestor with a pointer for accessing the service
   description document from the provider.  Also, as this attribute is
   intended to allow the creation of Web Service sessions, which usually
   use HTTP as transport protocol, this specification also defines two
   new proto values: 'TCP/HTTP' and 'TCP/TLS/HTTP'.  These new values
   are in conformance with RFC 4145 [2].

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as

3.  Motivation

   The aim of this Internet-Draft is the definition of a new SDP
   attribute in order to allow the exchanging of the necessary
   information between two entities willing to establish a "Web Service
   session" by using the SDP offer/answer model [4].  The established
   session could be used, for example, by a Web Service requestor (WS-
   requestor) in order to invoke a service exposed by a Web Service
   provider (WS-provider).  Considering that the Web Service Description
   Language document (WSDL) [10] is a key element on a standard Web
   Service interaction, a reference to this element needs to be included
   in the new attribute.

   The WSDL document contains an XML-based description of the public
   interface that a Web Service offers, so in the most generic Web
   Service interaction scenario, a WS-requestor will need access to the
   WSDL of a WS-provider in order to generate the required software to
   invoke the offered service.  A WS-requestor can obtain this service
   WSDL document URI in multiple manners, e.g., through WS-specific
   mechanisms, such as UDDI [11], or directly (in a peer-to-peer
   fashion) from the service provider, either by pre-sharing the WSDL
   URI (if the service resides in a fixed device) or by using the
   mechanism proposed in this Internet-Draft to obtain this URI
   dynamically (especially suitable for nomadic/mobile devices).

   The usage of nomadic/mobile devices (laptops, PDA and mobile phones)
   acting as services providers becomes a reality.  The demand on such
   devices has experienced a spectacular increase, in parallel with the
   growth of the capabilities that these devices can offer (memory, CPU
   power, autonomy, interoperability...), and the intensive deployments
   of wireless networks based on different technologies (like WiFi or
   WiMax).

   The definition of a SDP offer/answer model-based mechanism to
   retrieve the WSDL document is especially relevant in a mobile and
   pervasive environment.  The physical network address of a mobile
   computer hosting a service can change for many reasons, e.g., a
   network handover, or because the device is switched off since the
   user wants to remain connected from a different one.

4.  The 'wsdl' Attribute

   This section provides the definition of the 'wsdl' attribute using
   Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF) [5] notation:

    wsdl-attribute = "a=wsdl:" wsdl-uri
    wsdl-uri       = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   The 'wsdl' attribute contains a pointer (the 'wsdl-uri' part) to the
   WSDL file that defines the Web Service offered.  This pointer has the
   form of a URI, as defined in RFC 3986 [6].

   As WSDL files are usually fetched using HTTP, the most common value
   for the 'scheme' field is 'http'.

5.  Examples

   This section shows the SDP messages that will be exchanged when a
   service consumer (Alice) contacts the service provider (Bob) in order
   to define a new service session.  In such an interaction, Alice is
   the Offerer and Bob is the Answerer, according to the SDP Offer/
   Answer Model [4].

   When a positive answer is received in response to a previous offer,
   the new service session is created and ready to be used.  Alice and
   Bob will then send and receive the SOAP messages needed to consume
   the service.  The WSDL file location is sent by the service provider
   as part of the service session creation process.

   In order to define the service session, Alice constructs the SDP
   shown below:

       v=0
       o=alice 28903711 28903711 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
       s=-
       c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
       t=0 0
       m=application 9 TCP/HTTP soap+xml
       a=setup:active

   The SDP above defines a HTTP session targeted to the exchange of SOAP
   messages.  Although other protocols could also be used, HTTP is the
   most popular binding for SOAP.

   The SDP "s=" line has a value of "-", as recommended by RFC 3264 [4]
   for unicast sessions.  Also in RFC 3264, it is recommended to use a
   value of "0 0" for the "t=" line when the session is initiated and
   terminated using external signaling means, which will always be the
   case in this kind of sessions.

   Of course, the "m=" line defines an application-type media that will
   be used to send and receive SOAP messages over HTTP.  A client-server
   relationship is defined for the exchange of SOAP messages, with Alice
   being the client in this example.  As this kind of communication is
   connection-oriented, this specification is in conformance with RFC
   4145 [2].

   On the one hand, this specification uses a new proto value, 'TCP/
   HTTP' (and 'TCP/TLS/HTTP' when using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [12] to secure the HTTP communication).  On the other hand, it reuses
   the 'setup' attribute, which is used here with a value of "active" to
   indicate that Alice will initiate the SOAP interaction.  Besides, the
   port number included in the "m=" line is set to 9 (the discard port),

Internet-Draft               WSDL Attribute                November 2007


   as it is irrelevant but a valid port number must be used (as
   recommended in RFC 4145).

   When Bob receives Alice's offer, he constructs an answer and sends it
   back to Alice.  The SDP answer is shown below:

       v=0
       o=bob 28903823 28903823 IN IP4 192.0.2.2
       s=-
       c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
       t=0 0
       m=application 80 TCP/HTTP soap+xml
       a=setup:passive
       a=wsdl:http://192.0.2.2/service.wsdl

   In this answer, Bob indicates that he is willing to accept ("a=setup:
   passive") SOAP messages over HTTP at the port 80.  Finally, he uses a
   "a=wsdl" line to indicate where the WSDL file that defines the
   service can be retrieved.

6.  Security Considerations

   As 'wsdl' attributes contain URIs to WSDL files, an attacker may
   attempt to use this URI to contact the service.  This is usually not
   a problem, as authentication mechanisms can be imposed by the
   service.

   However, an attacker could also modify the content of the 'wsdl'
   attribute or even remove it completely.  This could lead to Denial of
   Service (DoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks or other kinds of
   attacks depending on how the applications handle the bogus
   signalling.  Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED to apply integrity
   protection to SDP session descriptions.

   For session descriptions carried as SIP message bodies, mechanisms as
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [12] or Secure MIME (S/MIME) [13] MAY
   be used to provide integrity protection.  These mechanisms can also
   be used to provide confidentiality if required.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new 'wsdl' media-level attribute for SDP.
   Its format is defined in Section 4.  The following information
   characterizes the 'wsdl' attribute:

      Contact name:            Vicente Olmedo <volmedo@dit.upm.es>.

      Attribute name:          'wsdl'.

      Type of attribute:       Media level.

      Subject to charset:      No.

      Purpose of attribute:    The 'wsdl' attribute provides the URI of
                               the WSDL file that defines a Web Service.

   No standard values need to be defined.  As the 'wsdl' attribute
   contains the URI of a WSDL file, every URI in conformance with RFC
   3986 [6] is also an allowed value for the 'wsdl' attribute.

   Additionally, this document defines new proto values: 'TCP/HTTP' and
   'TCP/TLS/HTTP'.  These proto values should be registered by the IANA
   under "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "proto".
   These values are constructed according to the advices given in
   Section 8 of RFC 4145 [2].

   According to the RFC 4566 [1], that defines SDP, the definition of
   new proto values must be accompanied by the definition of the
   associated media formats, i.e., the allowed fmt values.  For the HTTP
   protocol, new formats SHOULD have an associated MIME registration.
   Use of an existing MIME subtype for the format is encouraged.  If no
   MIME subtype exists, it is RECOMMENDED that a suitable one is
   registered through the IETF process [7] by production of, or
   reference to, a standards-track RFC that defines the transport
   protocol for the format.
