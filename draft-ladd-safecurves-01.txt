1. Introduction

   This document contains a set of elliptic curves over prime fields
   with many security and performance advantages. They are twist-secure,
   have large prime order subgroups, high embedding degree, endomorphism
   rings of large discriminant, and primes of fast shapes.

   These curves have been generated in a rigid manner by computer
   search. As such there is very little risk that these curves were
   selected to exhibit weaknesses to attacks not in the open literature.
   The field is the only free choice, and in all circumstances has been
   picked to enable highly efficent arithemetic. Proofs of all
   properties claimed exist in [SAFECURVES].

2. The Curves

   Each curve is given by an equation and a basepoint, together with an
   order. All curves are elliptic. Validation information is given at
   [SAFECURVES]. The names given in this document indicate the family.
   The basepoint is given as an (x,y) ordered pair.

3. Explicit Formulas

   On Montgomery curves, curves of the form y^2=x^3+Ax^2+x, the typical
   technique is to work over the Kummer curve instead, i.e. drop y
   coordinates for use in Diffie-Hellman. Let (X_1,Z_1), (X_2,Z_2),
   (X_3,Z_3) be coordinates such that X_i/Z_i is the x-coordinate of
   P_i, with P_i=[i]P_1 on the curve. Then
         X5 = Z1*((X3-Z3)*(X2+Z2)+(X3+Z3)*(X2-Z2))2
         Z5 = X1*((X3-Z3)*(X2+Z2)-(X3+Z3)*(X2-Z2))2
         X4 = (X2+Z2)2*(X2-Z2)2
         Z4 = (4*X2*Z2)*((X2-Z2)2+a24*(4*X2*Z2))

   gives X_i/Z_i as the x coordinate of P_i for i in {4,5} where
   a24*4=A+2

   On Edwards curves, curves of the form, x^2+y^2=1+dx^2y^2 a complete
   addition formula, which works for doubling as well, is given by
   representing points as x=Z/X, y=Z/Y. The formula for adding (X_1,
   Y_1, Z_1) to (X_2, Y_2, Z_2) yielding (X_3, Y_3, Z_3) is then
         A = Z1*Z2
         B = d*A2
         C = X1*X2
         D = Y1*Y2
         E = C*D
         H = C-D
         I = (X1+Y1)*(X2+Y2)-C-D
         X3 = c*(E+B)*H

         Y3 = c*(E-B)*I
         Z3 = A*H*I

   These formulas are from the [EFD].

   Using these formulas the standard double-and-add or Montgomery ladder
   recurrence can be used to compute multiples of points.

   The Montgomery curve fromulas require only the x coordinate.
   Protocols based on ECDH should give strong consideration to
   transmitting only the x coordinate, in which case no validation is
   required. The above addition formulas cannot be used to add points on
   Montgomery curves, as they ignore the y coordinate entirely.

   It is highly recommended that Edwards curve points are transmitted in
   compressed form to avoid implementations with missing curve
   membership checks from working. The canonical compression is the y
   coordinate, followed by an indicator of the low bit of the x
   coordinate. Formulas for decompression are left as an exercise to the
   reader.

4. Security Considerations

   This entire document discusses methods of implementing cryptography
   securely. The time for an attacker to break the DLP on these curves
   is the square root of the group order with the best known attacks.
   These curves are twist-secure, avoiding the need for some checks in
   some protocols.

   It is recommended that implementors use the Montgomery ladder on
   Montgomery curves with x coordinate only to avoid side-channel
   attacks when Diffie-Hellman is being used. In this mode, curve checks
   are not required. Otherwise standard curve (but not group) membership
   checks are required for ECDH to be secure.

   These curves are complete, avoiding certain attacks against naive
   implementations of ECC protocols. They have cofactor greater than
   one, occasionally requiring slight adjustments to protocols.

   This is not an exhaustive discussion of security considerations
   relating to the implementation of these curves. Implementors must be
   familiar with cryptography to safely implement any cryptographic
   standard, and this standard is no exception.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA should maintain a registry of these curves, calling them
   chicagocurve-XXXX where XXXX is the curve identifier.
