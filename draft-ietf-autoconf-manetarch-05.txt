1.  Introduction

   A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) consists of a loosely connected set
   of MANET routers.  Each MANET router embodies routing/forwarding
   functionality and may also incorporate host functionality.  These
   routers organize and maintain a routing structure among themselves.
   These routers may communicate over dynamic wireless channels with
   asymmetric reachability, may be mobile, and may join and leave the
   network at any time.  MANETs' characteristics create challenges in
   several areas, and may require protocol extensions or new MANET
   protocols altogether.

   This document is focused on IP networking, though many of MANETs'
   concepts and issues span the protocol stack.

   This document is meant to complement [RFC2501] in describing and
   defining MANET.


2.  Terminology

   Owing to the fact that a MANET, as described in this document, is an
   instance of an IP network, much of the terminology employed in this
   document is borrowed from existing documents.  Some of the documents
   that contain relevant terminology are [RFC1812], [RFC2328],
   [RFC2453], [RFC2460], [RFC2461], [RFC4291], [RFC3753], and [RFC4903].
   In some cases the terminology is slightly abbreviated or rephrased;
   although, every effort made to retain the meanings.  Borrowed
   terminology is provided in Section 2.1 with the intent of providing a
   complete discussion of MANETs using coherent terminology.  MANET
   specific terminology is provided in Section 2.2.

2.1.  Borrowed Terminology

   This document employs the following definitions:

   Node (N)
      any device (router or host) that implements IP.

   Router (R)
      a node that forwards IP packets not explicitly addressed to
      itself.

   Host (H)
      any node that is not a router, i.e. a host does not forward
      packets addressed to others.

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   Link
      a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
      communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below
      IP.  Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP links, X.25,
      Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well as internet (or higher) layer
      "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 itself.

   Asymmetric Reachability
      Asymmetric reachability describes two properties of certain
      interface types' underlying communication facilities.  First, non-
      transitive communication means packets from X can reach Y, and
      packets from Y can reach Z, but packets from X may not reach Z.
      Second, non-bidirectional communication means that packets from X
      can reach Y but packets from Y may not reach X. Many radio/
      wireless interfaces exhibit these properties.

   Neighbor
      If node X can directly send or receive IP packets to/from node Y,
      then node Y is node X's neighbor.

   Interface
      A node's point of attachment to a communication link.

   Broadcast Interface
      An interface with the known capability to address a single link
      layer transmission to all of the attached nodes (broadcast).  The
      set of nodes receiving a given physical broadcast message are
      neighbors of the node originating the message.

   Full-Broadcast Interface (FBI)
      A broadcast interface known to have both transitive and
      bidirectional communication, i.e. it does not exhibit asymmetric
      reachability.  Nodes which are connected to the same link via
      Full-Broadcast Interfaces can all send and receive IP packets
      directly to each other -- all nodes are thus bi-directional
      neighbors.  Ethernet interfaces connected via a single Ethernet
      segment is an example of a FBI.

   Semi-Broadcast Interface (SBI)
      A broadcast interface that may exhibit asymmetric reachability.
      Multiple access wireless radio interfaces are often SBI.  Note
      that since a SBI *may* exhibit asymmetric reachability, it also
      may not.  Thus, a FBI can be said to be a special case of SBI, or
      rather, a protocol which is capable of operating under the
      constraints of an SBI will ALSO be able to operate with an FBI.

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   Classic IP Interface
      A classic IP interface has both transitive and bidirectional
      properties, i.e. is an FBI.  A classic IP interface furthermore
      assumes that a particular set of addresses, specifically those
      within the same prefix as the IP address of the classic IP
      interface, are reachable within one IP hop.  Put another way, a
      classic IP interface, configured with an address p::i and a prefix
      p::, assumes that all other addresses within the prefix p:: are
      either assigned other to classic IP interfaces which are reachable
      within one IP hop -- or are not used/present in the network at
      all.

   Border Router (BR)
      a router that participates in multiple routing regions, and often
      multiple routing protocols.  A BR defines the border between its
      multiple routing regions.  A BR is responsible for presenting a
      consistent picture of the nodes reachable through itself to each
      routing region.  A BR determines the routing information to
      propagate between different routing regions.

2.2.  MANET Terminology

   The following terminology is proper to MANETs:

   MANET Interface
      A MANET interface may demonstrate asymmetric reachability (e.g.,
      SBI) and/or neighboring nodes' addresses may not be a priori
      known.  Note: according to the definition of a classic IP
      interface, such an interface satisfies the characteristics of a
      MANET interface -- with the additional nice properties that it
      does not exhibit asymmetric reachability and a set of neighboring
      nodes' addresses are known a priori.  Thus, a classic IP interface
      can be said to be a special case of a MANET interface, or rather,
      a protocol which is capable of operating under the constraints of
      a MANET interface will ALSO be able to operate with a classic IP
      interface.  A more detailed discussion of MANET interface
      characteristics is provided in Section 4.

   MANET Router (MNR)
      a MANET router embodies router functionality and may also include
      host functionality, reachable via its loopback interface(s).  A
      MANET router has one or more MANET interfaces.  A MANET router may
      also have zero or more classic IP interfaces to which itself (via
      loopback), hosts, routers, or networks may connect; i.e. the
      router may be responsible for several IP prefixes.  A MANET router
      is expected to participate in routing on behalf of one or more of
      its interfaces.  A MANET router is illustrated in Figure 1.

                          Figure 1: MANET Router

   MANETs can be described by several topological scopes, as defined in
   the following:

   MANET Neighborhood
      a set of MANET routers that is within one IP hop, receives
      messages sent via link-local [RFC4007] messaging.

   MANET
      a routing region consisting of a set of MANET routers that is
      within one or more MANET router hops.  If a MANET connects to
      other routing regions, its border is defined by Border Routers.

   Dependent upon the deployment and management strategy, coalescing and
   fragmentation of MANETs may be a supported feature.  In other words,
   if a communication path between two previously separated MANET
   routers or MANETs becomes available, the two MANETs may merge to form
   a single larger MANET.  Similarly, if a communication path between
   two MANET routers is disappears and no alternative path between the
   routers exists, then the MANET may be partitioned into two separate
   MANETs.

   When discussing MANETs' connectivity to other networks, such as the
   Internet, a MANET is bounded by border routers (BR).  That is, a
   MANET's BR form a border between a MANET and other routing regions.


3.  MANET Motivation Discussion

   The Internet Protocol (IP) core design tenets -- connectionless
   networking and packet-based forwarding -- are ideally suited for use
   in highly dynamic contexts, such as MANETs.  Yet, some additional



Chakeres, et al.        Expires February 28, 2008               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   functionality is required to meet the unique challenges and
   opportunities present in MANETs.

3.1.  Packet Radio Networks

   The initial motivation for MANETs was called Packet Radio (PR)
   networking [FL01].  In PR, each router is equipped with a single
   wireless interface.  Each router may be mobile, and the routers may
   be or may become spatially distributed such that all routers cannot
   communicate directly.  That is, two routers might require one or more
   intermediate routers to forward (route) packets on their behalf.  In
   the example shown in Figure 2: for PR1 to send packets to PR3, the
   intermediary PR2 must relay the packets.  This implies that PR2 must
   receive the packet from PR1 on its interface and determine that it
   must retransmit the packet over the same interface as the one where
   the packet was received, in order for the packet to reach PR3.  From
   the point of view of PR2, both PR1 and PR3 are neighboring routers,
   whereas PR1 and PR3 are not themselves neighboring routers of one
   another.

3.2.  Packet Radio Networks and the Internet

   Packet Radio networks inspired several architecture related
   challenges, including how to interconnect Packet Radio networks and
   other networks, especially fixed networks like the ARPANET.  Another
   related challenge was how to deal with the large disparity between
   different node and interface characteristics present in different
   networks.

   These aspects of Packet Radio networks helped stimulate the early
   development of the Internet Protocol; an architecture based on
   connectionless networking and packet-based forwarding that enables
   interconnection of heterogeneous devices over heterogeneous
   communication technologies.

3.3.  Packet Radio Networks and MANETs

   The router configuration in Figure 2 is the simplest MANET router
   configuration: a single interface exhibiting MANET interface
   characteristics (asymmetric reachability, non pre-determined
   neighborhood).  Many other challenges exist, in MANETs and in Packet
   Radio Networks both: wireless interfaces imply shared communication
   resources which result in interdependence between nearby nodes, and
   these nodes often communicate directly or indirectly.  Wireless
   channel statistical dynamics and node mobility may result in frequent
   packet channel losses and network topology changes.

   Figure 3 shows a general schematic of a MANET: each MANET Router
   (MNR) has one or more MANET Interfaces, over which MANET interface
   aware protocols operate to ensure MANET communication, and zero or
   more non-MANET interfaces, either towards hosts or other networks.
   Over these non-MANET interfaces, protocols need not be aware of MANET
   interface characteristics, thus classic IP interfaces can be assumed.

4.  MANET Interface Characteristics

   Inheriting from Packet Radio as described above, primary
   particularities of MANETs are the characteristics and qualities of
   MANET interfaces, and the challenges these entail for protocol design

   and development.

4.1.  Qualities - Wireless, Mobile, Ad hoc

   In MANETs several qualities impact protocol design.  The most
   fundamental qualities are wireless interface characteristics,
   mobility, and ad hoc interaction.

   Wireless interfaces exhibit challenging characteristics when compared
   to wired interfaces.  Many protocols (e.g.  IPv6 neighbor discovery
   [RFC2461]) do not operate in wireless networks with asymmetric
   reachability.  Wireless interfaces also exhibit dynamic time varying
   performance (e.g. packet loss, data rate) that can significantly
   impact local communication.

   Mobility can also exacerbate wireless networking issues, making it
   more challenging to attain, establish, and maintain network
   relationships between nodes.

   Ad hoc networking further compounds problems by allowing nodes to
   join and leave the network, or even form new networks, at will.

4.2.  Challenges

   MANET characteristics result in many challenges.  These challenges
   reveal themselves in many forms, and MANET specific protocols must
   often be developed.

4.2.1.  Semi-Broadcast Interface

   Given a wireless SBI that exhibits asymmetric reachability and
   spatially distributed MANET Routers, each MANET Router may have a
   different unique partial view of the MANET.  That is, each node may
   see a different set of adjacent MANET Routers.

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


       Figure 4: Semi-Broadcast Interface (SBI) Neighboring Routers

   The possibly unique set of adjacent MANET Routers perceived by each
   MANET Router often requires MANET Routers to forward packets out the
   same wireless interface as the one over which they were received.
   Topologically, this act of forwarding out the same interface may
   cause a packet to reach a different set of MANET Routers by
   traversing the wireless communication medium in a new location.  An
   example is provided in Figure 4, where each MANET Router is capable
   of reaching a different set of MANET Routers.

   The act of forwarding packets out of the same interface as the one
   over which they were received often results in duplicate IP packets
   being received at MANET Routers with more than one neighboring MANET
   Router, while also reaching a new subset of MANET Routers.  Thus,
   duplicate packet detection is often an inherent part of MANET
   protocol designs.

4.2.2.  Fuzzy Relationships Between Nearby MANET
        Routers & MANET Routers Extended Neighborhood

   Defining the process of determining neighboring MANET Routers'
   existence, continued existence, and loss of existence is a
   fundamental challenge in MANETs.  Relationships with neighboring
   MANET routers are hard to define due to the MANET interface
   characteristics: potential asymmetric reachability, potential time
   variation, and potentially other wireless properties.

   Historically, two nodes are either neighbors or not neighbors and
   several simple mechanisms have been used to determine neighbor
   relationships: single packet reception, acceptable loss rates, and
   simple handshakes.  [RFC2461], for example, employs an initial
   exchange of messages to determine neighborship, after which
   neighborship (or absence thereof) is assumed permanent.  In dynamic
   wireless networks the types of neighbor relationships expand, as do
   the mechanisms to detect and maintain the state of such
   relationships.

   Wireless network interfaces may exhibit unidirectional communication.
   Dynamic wireless networks may also experience significant time
   varying packet delivery between the same pair of wireless network
   interfaces, so simple loss rates may not be sufficient to define a
   neighbor relationship.  Similarly, as nodes (and, hence, interfaces)
   move relatively to each other, past loss rates may not reflect future
   communication capabilities.

   In wireless systems, nodes within the same small geographic region
   are often densely connected with other nearby nodes.  These nodes

   form a set of extended neighbor relationships that is referred to as
   a neighborhood.  A neighborhood is typically composed of several
   nodes, with each node being densely connected to other nodes.

   These more dynamic neighbor relationships do not sit well with
   certain Internet Protocols designed assuming a fixed Ethernet like
   model to communication links (bidirectional, transitive, and stable).
   Given the fuzzy neighbor relationships between MANET routers, the
   addressing model often associated with a Ethernet link is not valid.
   For example, in an Ethernet network routers are often told that a
   particular range of addresses are directly reachable.  In MANETs' a
   node often cannot make assumptions that a particular set of
   addressable nodes is always (directly) reachable.  Instead, nodes
   must detect and determine neighboring nodes, and handle changes to
   this set over time.

4.2.3.  MANET Membership

   Given MANETs' characteristics (mobile, wireless, ad hoc), determining
   a MANETs' membership is difficult, if not impossible in certain
   scenarios.

   MANET.

   Certain routers in a MANET might connect to other routing regions.
   These routers are called Border Routers (BRs), and they often run
   multiple routing protocol instances.  BRs are responsible for
   choosing the routing information to share between the various
   attached routing regions.  BRs should also present a consistent
   picture of the nodes reachable through them.

   As MANET membership changes, so does the connectivity of BR within
   the MANET.  Therefore, a BR may be challenged to present a consistent
   set of reachable nodes.  It may even choose not to share detailed
   routing information about the MANET topology to other routing
   regions.


5.  Addressing & the MANET Prefix Model

   This section presents an architectural model for MANETs which
   preserves the integrity of the conventional IP addressing
   architecture while allowing for the particularities of MANETs.

5.1.  General Address Architecture

   This architectural model considers MANET routers as simply routers
   with addressable nodes attached, as illustrated in Figure 1.  The
   attached nodes may be "external" (i.e. attached to the router via
   other network interfaces) or "internal".  This implies that, from the
   point of view of these entities and the applications running on them,
   connectivity is via a classic IP interface.  Therefore applications
   are not exposed to the specific characteristics of MANET interfaces,
   e.g. asymmetric reachability or fuzzy neighbor relationships.

   A MANET router can be delegated zero or more prefixes.  If a MANET
   router is delegated a prefix p::, then prefixes derived from this
   prefix (p:1::, p:2::, ...) may be assigned to the MANET routers
   classic IP interfaces(s), and nodes on these classic IP interfaces
   may be assigned addresses from within this prefix, and configured
   with this prefix according to the address autoconfiguration
   mechanisms governing these interfaces [RFC2461] and [RFC2462].  This
   concept is illustrated in Figure 6.

   MANET interface(s) that exhibit asymmetric reachability or unknown/
   indeterministic membership attached to the router are specifically
   *NOT* configured with this prefix.  The configuration of these MANET
   interfaces is detailed in Section 5.2.

   If a MANET router is connected via a classic IP interface, on which



Chakeres, et al.        Expires February 28, 2008              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   an existing prefix and address allocation entity is present, then
   this interface may be configured with addresses and prefixes from
   that classic IP link.  This information may be in addition to or
   instead of configuring the MANET routers interface towards that
   classic IP link with a prefix derived from the prefix delegated to
   the MANET router.  A MANET routing protocol running on the MANET
   routers' MANET interface(s) may or may not include addresses and
   prefixes acquired on that MANET routers' interfaces and assigned to
   classic IP links in its routing messages.  The routing protocol
   configuration is administratively determined when deploying a MANET.

5.2.  MANET Interface Configuration

   MANET specific behaviors are exclusively exposed to the MANET
   interface(s) of the routers.  This behaviors may include asymmetric
   reachability, semi-broadcast interfaces, fuzzy MANET router neighbor
   relationships, unknown/indeterministic MANET membership, rapid
   topology dynamics, etc.

   The following characteristics deserve particular mention, since they
   distinguish the configuration and behavior of MANET interface(s)
   classic IP interfaces:



Chakeres, et al.        Expires February 28, 2008              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   Unique Prefixes
      MANET interfaces that are known to exhibit the above mentioned
      properties must be configured with unique prefixes.  The reason
      for this requirements is so that no two MANET interfaces are
      configured to appear within the same IP prefix.  Common ways to
      achieve this are:

      *  unnumbered interfaces (IPv4);

      *  link-local addresses (IPv6);

      *  /128 (IPv6) or /32 (IPv4) prefixes.

      It is worth noting that prefix lengths shorter than /128 (IPv6) or
      /32 (IPv4) are possible on the MANET interfaces, as long as the
      prefixes are unique to a single MANET interface.  Note that the
      above statement is not an exception, but simply a clarification
      that MANET are no different from other networks in this respect.

   Link-local Multicast/Broadcast Scope
      On a MANET interface, a packet sent to a link-local multicast or
      broadcast addresses reaches the MANET interfaces of neighboring
      MANET routers, regardless of their configured addresses.  Link-
      local packets are never forwarded and since a MANET may span
      several hops, nodes cannot assume that a packet sent to a link-
      local address will reach all MANET routers within a MANET.

5.3.  Routers and Hosts in a MANET

   The MANET addressing model presented in this section makes a clear
   separation between the role of router and host in a MANET,
   recognizing that:

   o  MANET interfaces are seen only by the MANET aware router, assumed
      to be MANET aware, and running appropriate protocols;

   o  nodes and networks/subnets on non-MANET interface(s) assume a
      classic IP link model;

   o  applications on hosts and protocols assuming classic IP interfaces
      run unmodified.

   MANET protocols are protocols developed to work on MANET interfaces
   and to be MANET-aware.  The MANET WG is chartered to develop routing
   protocols for MANET interfaces.  The Autoconf WG is chartered to
   develop autoconfiguration protocols for MANET interfaces and MANET
   routers.




Chakeres, et al.        Expires February 28, 2008              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   Note that this addressing framework is similar to how routing in the
   existing Internet is structured.  Routers run their routing protocol
   over router interconnects with various characteristics to which only
   the routing protocols are privy.  On the other hand, hosts connect to
   the routers over classic IP interfaces with well-known
   characteristics.


6.  MANETs' Place in the Network Stack

   While the MANET WG is focused on network (L3) routing, that does not
   imply that MANETs and their protocols are limited to L3.  Several
   previous and existing efforts are applying MANET protocols at various
   layers.  The challenges discussed above, exist independent of at
   which layer MANET protocols are deployed.  Of course, the protocols
   themselves may need to be retooled slightly to accommodate the
   information available to the deployed layer.

   One example of sub-IP MANET routing is MANET MAC layer (L2) routing.
   This type of routing is often called bridging, and may work in
   homogeneous wireless networks for delivering frames over multiple
   hops.

   L2 routing/bridging hides the multiple L2 hops from L3.  This
   behavior can be advantageous as this network can transparently mimic
   an Ethernet, to some extent.  The ability to mimic Ethernet allows
   the L2 MANET to utilize existing L3 network protocols.  On the other
   hand, this transparency may lead to performance problems.  For
   example, if the L3 protocols make heavy use of broadcast messaging or
   if devices assume that high-speed wired bandwidth resources are
   available.

   L2 MANETs do not enable heterogeneity.  That is, a L2 MANET is not
   capable of bridging across heterogeneous interfaces.  For example, L2
   bridging cannot directly bridge two L2 technologies with different
   addressing schemes.  It can also be difficult if the frame sizes of
   two L2 vary, as this could require breaking a single frame into
   multiple frames of a different format.

   L3 MANETs enable heterogeneous networking, as IP was built with this
   feature in mind.  Forming a MANET at L3 implies that the L3 protocols
   must handle the challenges presented in this document.

   MANET like protocols can also be used at other layers, both above and
   below L3.  Another example is peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.  These
   networks have some of the same challenges as MANET, e.g. variable
   neighbor relationships and changing membership.

7.  Cross Layering

   In wireless networks, and especially in MANETs, extended interfacing
   among the network layers (physical, MAC, link, network, etc.) can be
   extremely useful.  Arguably, for MANET deployments to be successful,
   some degree of cross layering should be considered.  For example,
   link layer feedback that a packet/frame was not able to be sent or
   that it was not received could be used by the network layer to
   indicate that a neighboring MANET router is no longer reachable.
   This information and other extended interfacing could reduce, or
   eliminate, some upper layer messaging.  Further, it could
   significantly reduce the latency in decision making.  Note that
   though a certain lower layer information is valuable, it likely needs
   to be extrapolated or filtered before accurate assumptions about the
   network state can be made.  For example, failure to deliver a single
   frame by itself may not be a good indicator that a node is or is not
   reachable.

   In networks with several different layers of MANET mechanisms, the
   sharing of information across different layers can be even more vital
   to creating and maintaining the network.  For example, if a P2P
   network is run on top of a L3 MANET, the two networks can share
   information to use a similar optimized topology, and neighboring
   MANET router state changes to reduce the messaging or the latency in
   making decisions.


8.  Deployment Taxonomy

   The present and future proliferation of inexpensive wireless
   interfaces continues to stimulate technical interest and developments
   in the area of MANET for a wide variety of deployment scenarios.  In
   this section, we present several characteristics for describing
   expected MANET deployments.

8.1.  Service Availability

   Nodes often expect certain services/servers to be available.  When
   describing a deployment scenario, it is important to specify the
   expected services available and the distance between the
   participating nodes.  In MANET, nodes might assume a service is
   available locally (within one IP hop) or within a particular scope
   (one or more IP hops - MANET, site, global).  Nodes might assume in
   certain deployments that no special servers/services are available.
   Finally, nodes might assume that servers are sometimes available, but
   their availability is not guaranteed or ensured.

   Different frameworks for autoconfiguration, network management, and



Chakeres, et al.        Expires February 28, 2008              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   intra-AS routing can be developed based upon the expected constraints
   and operating conditions.

8.2.  Number of MANET Routers in a MANET

   The number of peer MANET routers in a MANET is an important
   consideration.  This number is not the complete number of nodes in a
   MANET (since MANET routers may support an arbitrary number of
   connected nodes) but a measure of the number of MANET routers
   participating as a cohesive flat routing region.  That is, the number
   of MANET routers within a single routing region.

   While the number of peer MANET routers does not define scalability of
   a MANET protocol, it is often useful to discuss the number of peer
   MANET router to get a feel for maturity of typical deployment
   solutions.  For simplicity we define the following network sizes to
   aid in discussion:

   Small
      2-30 peer MANET routers

   Moderate
      30-100 peer MANET routers

   Large
      100-1000 peer MANET routers

   Very large
      Larger than 1000 peer MANET routers

   As of 2007, small and moderate size peer MANET routing scenarios have
   matured and have undergone reasonable test and deployment experience.
   MANETs of those sizes can perform reasonably well in many cases
   without hierarchy.  For scaling up to large and very large MANET
   networks, routing hierarchies, a standard technique for wired
   Internet routing, is a possibility.  While scaling design extensions
   exist, large and very large MANET flat routing regions are still a
   topic of ongoing active research and are not discussed further here.


9.  Security Considerations

   Each MANET router may not know its neighborhood a priori
   (Section 2.2), but it should determine its neighborhood dynamically
   and track changes as the network evolves.  Similarly for MANET
   network membership (Section 4.2.3), MANET routers may leave or join a
   MANET, and the MANET may partition or merge with others.  In addition
   to these issues, many MANET routers are expected to communicate over



Chakeres, et al.        Expires February 28, 2008              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft             MANET Architecture                August 2007


   wireless interfaces; and the "open" nature of wireless communication
   means that nearby nodes will often be capable of sending and
   receiving MANET protocol packets.

   Without any security measures MANET routers operating under these
   characteristics will often expose protocol information to and accept
   information from nearby nodes.  Protecting MANET routers from
   disruptive nearby nodes can be performed by using CONFIDENTIALITY,
   DATA INTEGRITY, and PEER ENTITY AUTHENTICATION.

   Different deployments of MANETs may have very different security
   requirements.  For example, if a MANET is deployed for a military
   purpose, exposing the network topology to any outside party may be
   not be acceptable -- whereas for a civilian deployment exposure of
   topology information may be of little or no importance.  Furthermore,
   different deployments may require different mechanisms to address
   security issues (e.g. pre-sharing of keys or certificates), and the
   MANET routers themselves may have various additional constraints
   (e.g. computational power for generating or verifying cryptographic
   attributes).  Therefore, due to the large diversity of MANET routers
   and their deployments, MANET protocols should allow for appropriate,
   and possibly multiple or various, security mechanisms.

   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has
   made any independent effort to identify any such rights.  Information
   on the procedures with respect to rights in RFC documents can be
   found in BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of
   such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this
   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at
   http://www.ietf.org/ipr.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF at
   ietf-ipr@ietf.org.
