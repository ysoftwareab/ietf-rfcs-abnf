1.  Introduction

   HTTP intermediaries - including both forward proxies and gateways
   (also known as "reverse proxies") - have become an increasingly
   significant part of HTTP deployments.  In particular, reverse proxies
   and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) form part of the critical
   infrastructure of many Web sites.

   Typically, HTTP intermediaries forward requests towards the origin
   server and then forward their responses back to clients.  However, if
   an error occurs before a response is obtained from upstream, the
   response is generated by the intermediary itself.

   HTTP accommodates these types of errors with a few status codes; for
   example, 502 Bad Gateway and 504 Gateway Timeout.  However,
   experience has shown that more information is necessary to aid
   debugging and communicate what's happened to the client.

   Additionally, intermediaries sometimes want to convey additional
   information about their handling of a response, even if they did not
   generate it.

   To enable these uses, Section 2 defines a new HTTP response field to
   allow intermediaries to convey details of their handling of a
   response, Section 2.1 enumerates the kind of information that can be
   conveyed, and Section 2.3 defines a set of error types for use when a
   proxy generates the response.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses Structured Headers
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure] to specify syntax.  The terms sf-
   list, sf-item, sf-string, sf-token, sf-integer and key refer to the
   structured types defined therein.

   Note that in this specification, "proxy" is used to indicate both
   forward and reverse proxies, otherwise known as gateways.  "Next hop"
   indicates the connection in the direction leading to the origin
   server for the request.

2.  The Proxy-Status HTTP Field

   The Proxy-Status HTTP response field allows an intermediary to convey
   additional information about its handling of a response and its
   associated request.

   It is a List [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]:

   Proxy-Status   = sf-list

   Each member of the list represents an intermediary that has handled
   the response.  The first member of the list represents the
   intermediary closest to the origin server, and the last member of the
   list represents the intermediary closest to the user agent.

   For example:

   Proxy-Status: FooProxy, ExampleCDN

   indicates that this response was handled first by FooProxy and then
   ExampleCDN.

   Intermediaries determine when it is appropriate to add the Proxy-
   Status field to a response.  Some might decide to add it to all
   responses, whereas others might only do so when specifically
   configured to, or when the request contains a header that activates a
   debugging mode.

   The list members identify the intermediary that inserted the value,
   and MUST have a type of either sf-string or sf-token.  Depending on

   the deployment, this might be a product or service name (e.g.,
   ExampleProxy or "Example CDN"), a hostname ("proxy-3.example.com"),
   and IP address, or a generated string.

   Parameters on each member convey additional information about that
   intermediary's handling of the response; see Section 2.1 for defined
   parameters.  While all of these parameters are OPTIONAL,
   intermediaries are encouraged to provide as much information as
   possible.

   When adding a value to the Proxy-Status field, intermediaries SHOULD
   preserve the existing contents of the field, to allow debugging of
   the entire chain of intermediaries handling the request.

   Proxy-Status MAY be sent in HTTP trailers, but - as with all trailers
   - it might be silently discarded along the path to the user agent, so
   this SHOULD NOT be done unless it is not possible to send it in
   headers.  For example, if an intermediary is streaming a response and
   the upstream connection suddenly terminates, Proxy-Status can be
   appended to the trailers of the outgoing message (since the headers
   have already been sent).

   Note that there are various security considerations for
   intermediaries using the Proxy-Status field; see Section 4.

   Origin servers MUST NOT generate the Proxy-Status field.

2.1.  Proxy-Status Parameters

   This section lists parameters that can be used on the members of
   Proxy-Status.

2.1.1.  next-hop

   The "next-hop" parameter's value is a sf-string or sf-token that
   identifies the intermediary or origin server selected (and used, if
   contacted) for this response.  Its contents might be a hostname, IP
   address, or alias.

   For example:

   Proxy-Status: cdn.example.org; next-hop=backend.example.org

2.1.2.  next-protocol

   The "next-protocol" parameter's value indicates the ALPN protocol
   identifier [RFC7301] used by the intermediary to connect to the next

Internet-Draft                Proxy-Status                   August 2020


   hop.  This is only applicable when that connection was actually
   established.

   The value MUST be either a sf-token or sf-binary.  If the protocol
   identifier is able to be expressed as a sf-token using UTF-8
   encoding, that form MUST be used.

   For example:

   Proxy-Status: "proxy.example.org"; next-protocol=h2

2.1.3.  error

   The "error" parameter's value is a sf-token that is a Proxy Error
   Type.  When present, it indicates that the response was generated by
   the proxy, not the origin server or any other upstream server.

   Section 2.3 lists the Proxy Error Types defined in this document; new
   ones can be defined using the procedure outlined in Section 2.4.

   For example:

   HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
   Proxy-Status: SomeCDN; error=connection_timeout

   indicates that this 504 response was generated by SomeCDN, due to a
   connection timeout when going forward.

   Or:

   HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   Proxy-Status: SomeReverseProxy; error=http_request_error

   indicates that this 429 Too Many Requests response was generated by
   the intermediary, not the origin.

   When sending the error parameter, the most specific Proxy Error Type
   SHOULD be sent, provided that it accurately represents the error
   condition.  If an appropriate Proxy Error Type is not defined, there
   are a number of generic error types (e.g., proxy_internal_error,
   http_protocol_error) that can be used.  If they are not suitable,
   consider registering a new Proxy Error Type (see Section 2.4).

   Each Proxy Error Type has a Recommended HTTP Status Code.  When
   generating a HTTP response containing "error", its HTTP status code
   SHOULD be set to the Recommended HTTP Status Code.  However, there
   may be circumstances (e.g., for backwards compatibility with previous
   behaviours) when another status code might be used.

2.1.4.  details

   The "details" parameter's value is a sf-string containing additional
   information not captured anywhere else.  This can include
   implementation-specific or deployment-specific information.

   For example:

  Proxy-Status: ExampleProxy; error="http_protocol_error";
                details="Malformed response header - space before colon"

2.2.  Defining New Proxy-Status Parameters

   New Proxy-Status Parameters can be defined by registering them in the
   HTTP Proxy-Status Parameters registry.

   Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated
   Expert, as per [RFC8126], Section 4.5.  A specification document is
   appreciated, but not required.

   The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating
   requests:

   o  Community feedback

   o  If the value is sufficiently well-defined

   o  Generic parameters are preferred over vendor-specific,
      application-specific or deployment-specific values.  If a generic
      value cannot be agreed upon in the community, the parameter's name
      should be correspondingly specific (e.g., with a prefix that
      identifies the vendor, application or deployment).

   Registration requests should use the following template:

   o  Name: [a name for the Proxy-Status Parameter that matches key]

   o  Description: [a description of the parameter semantics and value]

   o  Reference: [to a specification defining this parameter]

   See the registry at https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-status
   [4] for details on where to send registration requests.

   o  Extra Parameters: None.

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: 502

2.4.  Defining New Proxy Error Types

   New Proxy Error Types can be defined by registering them in the HTTP
   Proxy Error Types registry.

   Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated
   Expert, as per [RFC8126], Section 4.5.  A specification document is
   appreciated, but not required.

   The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating
   requests:

   o  Community feedback

   o  If the value is sufficiently well-defined

   o  Generic types are preferred over vendor-specific, application-
      specific or deployment-specific values.  If a generic value cannot
      be agreed upon in the community, the types's name should be
      correspondingly specific (e.g., with a prefix that identifies the
      vendor, application or deployment).

   Registration requests should use the following template:

   o  Name: [a name for the Proxy Error Type that matches sf-token]

Internet-Draft                Proxy-Status                   August 2020


   o  Description: [a description of the conditions that generate the
      Proxy Error Type]

   o  Extra Parameters: [zero or more optional parameters, along with
      their allowable type(s)]

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: [the appropriate HTTP status code
      for this entry]

   See the registry at https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-status
   [5] for details on where to send registration requests.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication, please create the HTTP Proxy-Status Parameters
   registry and the HTTP Proxy Error Types registry at
   https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses [6] and populate
   them with the types defined in Section 2.1 and Section 2.3
   respectively; see Section 2.2 and Section 2.4 for its associated
   procedures.

4.  Security Considerations

   One of the primary security concerns when using Proxy-Status is
   leaking information that might aid an attacker.  For example,
   information about the intermediary's configuration and back-end
   topology can be exposed.

   As a result, care needs to be taken when deciding to generate a
   Proxy-Status field.  Note that intermediaries are not required to
   generate a Proxy-Status field in any response, and can conditionally
   generate them based upon request attributes (e.g., authentication
   tokens, IP address).

   Likewise, generation of all parameters is optional.
