Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing user identities and the
   names, addresses, and credentials required to authenticate them, for
   use with various protocols.  This draft was motivated by the need for
   the configuration of authenticated user identities for the iSCSI
   protocol, but has been extended to be useful for other protocols that
   have similar requirements.  It is important to note that this MIB
   provides only the set of identities and the means to authenticate
   them; it is the responsibility of other MIBs making use of this one
   to tie them to authorization lists.

1.  Introduction

   This MIB will be used to configure and/or look at the configuration
   of user identities and their authentication information.  For the
   purposes of this MIB, a "user" identity does not need to be an actual
   person; a user can also be a host, an application, a cluster of
   hosts, or any other identifiable entity that can be authenticated and
   granted access to a resource.

   Most objects in this MIB have a MAX-ACCESS of read-create; the MIB is

Internet Draft           IPS Authentication MIB               March 2003


   intended to allow configuration of user identities and their names,
   addresses, and credentials.  MIN-ACCESS for all objects is read-only
   for those implementations that configure through other means, but
   require the ability to monitor user identities.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The identity authentication MIB does not directly address objects
   within other MIBs.  The identity address objects contain IPv4, IPv6,
   or other address types, and as such may be indirectly related to
   objects within the IPv4 MIB [RFC1213] [RFC2011] or IPv6 [RFC2465]
   MIB.

   This MIB does not cover authorization.  This should generally be done
   in MIBs that reference identities in this one.  It also does not
   cover login or authentication failure statistics or notifications, as
   these are all fairly application-specific, and not generic enough to
   include here.

   The user identity objects within this MIB are typically referenced
   from other MIBs by a RowPointer within that MIB.  A MIB containing
   resources for which it requires a list of authorized user identities
   may create such a list, with a single RowPointer within each list
   element pointing to a user identity within this MIB.  This is neither
   required nor restricted by this MIB.


4.  Discussion

   This MIB structure is intended to allow the configuration of a list
   of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses,

Internet Draft           IPS Authentication MIB               March 2003


   credentials, and certificates which when combined will authenticate
   that identity.

   The authentication MIB is structured around two primary "objects",
   the authentication instance, and the identity, which serve as
   containers for the remainder of the objects.  This section contains a
   brief description of the "object" hierarchy and a description of each
   object, followed by a discussion of the actual SNMP table structure
   within the objects.

4.1.  Authentication MIB Object Model

   The top-level object in this structure is the authentication
   instance, which "contains" all of the other objects.  The indexing
   hierarchy of this MIB looks like:

   ipsAuthInstance
      -- A distinct authentication entity within the managed system.
      -- Most implementations will have just one of these.
      ipsAuthIdentity
         -- A user identity, consisting of a set of identity names,
         -- addresses, and credentials reflected in the following
         -- objects, as well as a RowPointer to an ipsAuthCertificate.
         ipsAuthIdentityName
            -- A name for a user identity.  A name should be globally
            -- unique, and unchanging over time.  Some protocols may
            -- not require this one.
         ipsAuthIdentityAddress
            -- An address range, typically but not necessarily an
            -- IPv4, IPv6, or Fibre Channel address range, at which
            -- the identity is allowed to reside.
         ipsAuthCredential
            -- A single credential, such as a CHAP username/password,
            -- which can ipsAuthenticate the identity.
            ipsAuthCredChap
               -- CHAP-specific attributes for an ipsAuthCredential
            ipsAuthCredSrp
               -- SRP-specific attributes
            ipsAuthCredKerberos
               -- Kerberos-specific attributes

   Each identity contains the information necessary to authenticate a
   particular end-point that wishes to access a service, such as iSCSI.

   An identity can contain multiple names, addresses, and credentials.

Internet Draft           IPS Authentication MIB               March 2003


4.2.  ipsAuthInstance

   The ipsAuthInstanceAttributesTable is the primary table of the
   authentication MIB.  Every other table entry in this MIB includes the
   index of an ipsAuthInstanceAttributesEntry as its primary index.  An
   authentication instance is basically a managed set of identities.

   Many implementations will include just one authentication instance
   row in this table.  However, there will be cases where multiple rows
   in this table may be used:

   - A large system may be "partitioned" into multiple, distinct virtual
     systems, perhaps sharing the SNMP agent but not their lists of
     identities.  Each virtual system would have its own authentication
     instance.

   - A set of stackable systems, each with their own set of identities,
     may be managed by a common SNMP agent.  Each individual system
     would have its own authentication instance.

   - Multiple protocols, each with their own set of identities, may
     exist within a single system and be managed by a single SNMP agent.
     In this case, each protocol may have its own authentication
     instance.


4.3.  ipsAuthIdentity

   The ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable contains one entry for each
   configured user identity.  The identity contains only a description
   of what the identity is used for; its attributes are all contained in
   other tables, since they can have multiple values.

   Other MIBs containing lists of users authorized to access a
   particular resource should generally contain a RowPointer to the
   ipsAuthIdentAttributesEntry which will, if authenticated, be allowed
   access.

   All other table entries make use of the indices to this table as
   their primary indices.

4.4.  ipsAuthIdentityName

   The ipsAuthIdentNameAttributesTable contains a list of UTF-8 names,
   each of which belong to, and may be used to identify, a particular
   identity in the authIdentity table.

   Implementations making use of the authentication MIB may identify

Internet Draft           IPS Authentication MIB               March 2003


   their resources by names, addresses, or both.  A name is typically a
   unique (within the required scope), unchanging identifier for a
   resource. It will normally meet some or all of the requirements for a
   Uniform Resource Name [RFC1737], although a name in the context of
   this MIB does not need to be a URN.  Identifiers that typically
   change over time should generally be placed into the
   ipsAuthIdentityAddress table; names that have no uniqueness
   properties should usually be placed into the description attribute
   for the identity.

   An example of an identity name is the iSCSI Name, defined in [ISCSI].

   If this table contains no entries associated with a particular user
   identity, the implementation does not need to check any name
   parameters when authenticating that identity.  If the table contains
   multiple entries associated with a particular user identity, the
   implementation should consider a match with any one of these entries
   to be valid.

4.5.  ipsAuthIdentityAddress

   The ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable contains a list of addresses at
   which the identity may be authenticated.  For example, an identity
   may be allowed access to a resource only from a certain IP address,
   or only if its address is in a certain range or set of ranges.

   Each entry contains a starting and ending address.  If a single
   address is desired in the list, both starting and ending addresses
   must be identical.

   Each entry contains an AddrType attribute.  This attribute contains
   an enumeration registered as an IANA Address Family type [IANA-AF].
   Although many implementations will use IPv4 or IPv6 address types for
   these entries, any IANA-registered type may be used, as long as it
   makes sense to the application.

   Matching any address within any range within the list associated with
   a particular identity is considered to be a valid match.  If no
   entries are present in this list for a given identity, its address is
   not checked during authentication.

   Netmasks are not supported, since an address range can express the
   same thing with more flexibility.  An application specifying
   addresses using network masks may do so, and convert to and from
   address ranges when reading or writing this MIB.

Internet Draft           IPS Authentication MIB               March 2003


4.6.  ipsAuthCredential

   The ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable contains a list of credentials,
   each of which may authenticate a particular identity.

   Each credential contains an authentication method to be used, such as
   CHAP [RFC1994], SRP [RFC2945], or Kerberos [RFC1510].  This attribute
   contains an object identifier instead of an enumerated type, allowing
   other MIBs to add their own authentication methods, without modifying
   this MIB.

   For each entry in this table, there will exist an entry in another
   table containing its attributes.  The table in which to place the
   entry depends on the AuthMethod attribute:

   CHAP     If the AuthMethod is set to the CHAP OID, an entry using the
            same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredChap table, which contains the CHAP username.

   SRP      If the AuthMethod is set to the SRP OID, an entry using the
            same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredSrp table, which contains the SRP username.

   Kerberos If the AuthMethod is set to the Kerberos OID, an entry using
            the same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredKerberos table, which contains the Kerberos
            principal.

   Other    If the AuthMethod is set to any OID not defined in this MIB,
            an entry using the same indices as the ipsAuthCredential
            entry should be placed in the other MIB that define whatever
            attributes are needed for that type of credential.

4.7.  IP, Fibre Channel, and Other Addresses

   The IP addresses in this MIB are represented by two attributes, one
   of type AddressFamilyNumbers, and the other of type AuthAddress.
   Each address can take on any of the types within the list of address
   family numbers; the most likely being IPv4, IPv6, or one of the Fibre
   Channel address types.

   The type AuthAddress is an octet string.  If the address family is
   IPv4 or IPv6, the format is taken from the InetAddress specified in
   [RFC3291].  If the address family is one of the Fibre Channel types,
   the format is identical to the FcNameIdOrZero type defined in
   [FCMGMT].

Internet Draft           IPS Authentication MIB               March 2003


4.8.  Descriptors: Using OIDs in Place of Enumerated Types

   Some attributes, particularly the authentication method attribute,
   would normally require an enumerated type.  However, implementations
   will likely need to add new authentication method types of their own,
   without extending this MIB.  To make this work, the MIB defines a set
   of object identities within ipsAuthDescriptors.  Each of these object
   identities is basically an enumerated type.

   Attributes that make use of these object identities have a value
   which is an OID instead of an enumerated type.  These OIDs can either
   indicate the object identities defined in this MIB, or object
   identities defined elsewhere, such as in an enterprise MIB.  Those
   implementations that add their own authentication methods should also
   define a corresponding object identity for each of these methods
   within their own enterprise MIB, and return its OID whenever one of
   these attributes is using that method.

4.9.  Notifications

   Monitoring of authentication failures and other notification events
   are outside the scope of this MIB, as they are generally application-
   specific.  No notifications are provided or required.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      All tables provide the ability to set up which credentials may be
      used to access services on the managed system, to remove
      legitimate credentials (a denial of service), or to remove
      individual credentials to weaken the requirements for access of a
      particular service.  In addition, write access may be used to
      change CHAP or SRP passwords to a known value.  Write access must
      always be tightly controlled.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      All tables provide the ability to find out which names, addresses,
      and credentials would be required to access services on the
      managed system.  If these credentials are easily spoofed
      (particularly the name or address), read access to the MIB must be
      tightly controlled.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to

   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
