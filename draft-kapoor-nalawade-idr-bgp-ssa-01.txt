3. Abstract

   This document defines a new BGP attribute  called  the  SAFI-Specific
   Attribute.    The  document  also  makes the attribute specific to be
   used by the Tunnel SAFI. The  Tunnel-SAFI  Specific  attribute  (also
   know  as  the  Tunnel  Attribute) is used to send out attributes of a
   Tunnel  used by routing  for  different  routing  applications.  This
   Tunnel   attribute  can  contain  various  'Types',  where  the  Type
   identifies what kind of Tunnel the TLV describes.


4. Introduction

   This  document  defines  a  new  BGP  attribute  called  the   Tunnel
   Attribute.  The value part of the Tunnel Attribute can contain one or
   more an attribute, which can carry Tunnel Attributes for one or  more
   Tunnel types originating on a given router.

   Also, unlike the fixed length (8 octets)  extended  community  types,
   the  SAFI-Specific  Attribute  TLV is a variable length entity, so it
   can carry data of any length, as required by the specific type  of  a
   SAFI-Specific Attribute TLV.


5. Format of the SAFI-Specific Attribute

   The format of the BGP SAFI-Specific attribute will be as follows:



   |  Attr. Flags  | Attr.Type Code|
                  0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

   |                      Attribute Value                          |

Internet Draft                       - 3 -                             July 2005


   The BGP Tunnel is a variable length, optional  transitive  attribute.
   The  Value  field  of  the  attribute  may  contain one or more SAFI-
   Speceific Attribute TLVs. The Value field of the Tunnel Attribute  is
   encoded  as  follows  and  may  contain  one  or  more  tuples of the
   following:

         - Type Field  : 2 octets
         - Length Field: 2 octets
         - Value Field : Variable


          0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       Type                    |       Length                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Value                                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type Field: The format of the Type Field is as shown below:

                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
               |T|                             |
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



            T - Transitive bit

            Value 1: The Tunnel type is transitive across ASes

            Value 0: The Tunnel type is non-transitive across ASes

            Remaining 15 bits: Indicate the type of the TLV.

   Length Field: The Length is 2 octets long and indicates the length of
   the Value field.

   The value contained in this Length field MUST not  exceed  the  total
   length  of  the  BGP  Tunnel  Attribute minus the total length of any
   prior TLVs.

   Value Field: The Value Field contains a TLV where the  Types  of  the
   TLV  are defined by the respective SAFIs.  The TLV in the Value field
   of this Attribute will be of the form :




draft-kapoor-nalawade-idr-bgp-ssa-01.txt                                [Page 3]





Internet Draft                       - 4 -                             July 2005


         - Type Field  : 2 octets
         - Length Field: 2 octets
         - Value Field : Variable

   The Value field will have a fixed part as specified by the respective
   Tunnel  Types  and  may  have a variable part in the form of Sub-TLVs
   encoded as follows :

         - Sub-Type Field  : 1 octets
         - Length Field: 1 octets
         - Value Field : Variable

6.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that supports a SAFI,  MUST  accept  any  SAFI-Specific
   Attribute
    TLVs that are part of the SAFI. If the SAFI-Specific  Attribute  TLV
   is  transitive,  the  BGP speaker MUST forward it even if it does not
   understand it. Operation rules are governed by those  for  the  SAFI.
   This attribute only requires that it be forwarded even when it is not
   understood.

   When sending an UPDATE message for this SAFI to a peer, a BGP speaker
   MUST only advertise the SAFI-Specific Attribute TLVs that are defined
   and are valid for that SAFI.

   A Capability has not been defined for this  attribute  intentionally.
   For  newer  SAFIs,  it  is  concieved that presence of the SAFI could
   imply understanding  the   SAFI-Specific  Attribute  and  the   SAFI-
   Specific  Attribute  TLVs.  For  existing  SAFIs,  a capbility may be
   required.


7. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.
