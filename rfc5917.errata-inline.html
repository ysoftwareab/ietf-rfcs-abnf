                      Clearance Sponsor Attribute

Abstract

   This document defines the clearance sponsor attribute.  It indicates
   the entity that sponsored (i.e., granted) the clearance.  This
   attribute is intended for use in public key certificates and
   attribute certificates that also include the clearance attribute.

<b>Section:</b> Introduction

<b>Original Text:</b>

This document specifies the clearance sponsor attribute.  It is
   included in public key certificates [RFC5280] and attribute
   certificates [RFC5755].  This attribute is only meaningful as a
   companion of the clearance attribute [RFC5755] [RFC5912].  The
   clearance sponsor is the entity (e.g., agency, department, or
   organization) that granted the clearance to the subject named in the
   certificate.  For example, the clearance sponsor for a subject
   asserting the Amoco clearance values [RFC3114] could be
   &quot;Engineering&quot;.

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

This document specifies the clearance sponsor attribute.  It is

RFC 5913 should be added to the references:

   [RFC5913]  Turner, S. and S. Chokhani, &quot;Clearance Attribute and
                        Authority Clearance Constraints Certificate Extension&quot;,
                        RFC 5913, June 2010.
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
The first paragraph in the section references RFC 5912. As far as I can see, it should really reference RFC 5913 (Clearance Attribute and Authority Clearance Constraints - Certificate Extension).
</div>
</div>
   This attribute may be used in automated authorization decisions.  For
   example, a web server deciding whether to allow a user access could
   check that the clearance sponsor present in the user&#x27;s certificate is
   on an &quot;approved&quot; list.  This check is performed in addition to
   certification path validation [RFC5280].  The mechanism for managing
   the &quot;approved&quot; list is beyond the scope of this document.

   NOTE: This document does not provide an equivalent Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) schema specification as this
   attribute is initially targeted at public key certificates [RFC5280]
   and attribute certificates [RFC5755].  Definition of an equivalent
   LDAP schema is left to a future specification.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  ASN.1 Syntax Notation

   The attribute is defined using ASN.1 [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], and
   [X.683].

2.  Clearance Sponsor

   The clearance sponsor attribute, which is only meaningful if the
   clearance attribute [RFC5755] [RFC5912] is also present, indicates
   the sponsor of the clearance of the subject with which this attribute
   is associated.  The clearance sponsor attribute is a DirectoryString
   [RFC5280], which MUST use the UTF8String CHOICE, with a minimum size
   of 1 character and a maximum of 64 characters.

   The following object identifier identifies the sponsor attribute:

   id-clearanceSponsor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
     joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)
     dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 68
   }

   The ASN.1 syntax for the clearance sponsor attribute is as follows:

   at-clearanceSponsor ATTRIBUTE ::= {
     TYPE                   DirectoryString { ub-clearance-sponsor }
                            ( WITH COMPONENTS { utf8String PRESENT } )
     EQUALITY MATCHING RULE caseIgnoreMatch
     IDENTIFIED BY          id-clearanceSponsor
   }

   ub-clearance-sponsor INTEGER ::= 64

   There MUST only be one value of clearanceSponsor associated with a
   particular certificate.  Distinct sponsors MUST be represented in
   separate certificates.

   When an environment uses the Clearance Sponsor attribute, it is
   important that the same representation of the sponsor be used
   throughout the environment (e.g., using the same acronym).  Further,
   the value in this attribute is not meant to be globally unique.  When
   included in certificates, it is unique within the scope of the
   issuer.

3.  Security Considerations

   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization process, the
   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each clearance sponsor
   value must ensure that the correct value is applied.  Including this
   attribute in a public key certificate or attribute certificate
   ensures that the value for the clearance sponsor is integrity
   protected.

   The certificate issuer and clearance sponsor are not necessarily the
   same entity.  If they are separate entities, then the mechanism used
   by the clearance sponsor to convey to the certificate issuer that the
   clearance sponsor did in fact grant the clearance to the subject
   needs to be protected from unauthorized modification.

   If two entities are verifying each other&#x27;s certificates, they do not
   share the same issuer, and they use the same clearance sponsor value
   (e.g., a United Kingdom PKI includes &quot;MoD&quot; and a New Zealand PKI also
   includes &quot;MoD&quot;), then the relying party has two choices: 1) accept

   the two strings as equivalent, or 2) indicate the sponsor as well as
   the trust anchor.  To solve this problem, a mechanism, which is
   outside the scope of this specification, could be developed to allow
   a relying party to group together issuers that share a same context
   within which sponsor names have a unique significance.

   While values of DirectoryString can include the NUL (U+0000) code
   point, values used to represent clearance sponsors typically would
   not.  Implementations of the caseIgnoreMatch rule must, per X.501,
   consider all of the assertion value and attribute value in matching
   and hence protect against truncation attacks.
