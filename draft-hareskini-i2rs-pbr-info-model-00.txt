             An Information Model for Basic Network Policy
                 draft-hareskini-i2rs-pbr-info-model-00

Abstract

   This document defines the I2RS Policy-Based Routing (PBR) policy
   information model describing I2RS interactions with the PBR in a
   routing system.  The PBR IM uses Policy Core Information Model (PCIM)
   framework (RFC3060, RFC3460, and RFC3644) to specify the ordered
   route list within the PBR RIB adapted to I2RS.

1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] architecture calls out for read and
   write access to the information and state within the routing
   elements.  The I2RS client interacts with the I2RS agent in one or
   more network routing systems.

   This I2RS Policy-Based Routing (PBR) Information model defined in
   this document describes the I2RS interaction with PBR within a
   routing element.

   The PBR requires an ordered list of policy.  This PBR informational
   model uses the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) framework as
   described in [RFC3060] with its extensions in [RFC3460] and QOS model
   in [RFC3644].  The adaptation of the PCIM model to I2RS use is
   described in [I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-info-model].

      can be combined into a policy rule.

   Policy Group

      The PCIM Framework defines policy groups as a group of policy

   Policy Set

      The PCIM framework defines a the Policy set (specifically the
      PolicySetComponent) as an aggregation class that allows
      aggregation of Policy Groups and the nesting of Policy Groups
      under Policy set rules.  The PolicySet rules include nesting
      policies and matching strategies (all-matching or first-match),
      priorities between rules, and roles.  One of the roles that must
      be conditionally matched is the models denotation of "read-only"
      or "read-write" policy rules into ordered and prioritized groups
      of policy.  The [I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-info-model] suggests that non-
      nested policy groups may be sufficient for initial I2RS and
      configuration work.

3.  The Policy Based Routing Information Model Overview

   Policy Based Routing (PBR) is a widely used term in the industry to
   describe a a technique used to make packet forwarding decisions
   decisions based on policies set by the network administrator.  PBR
   enables network administrator to forward the packet based on other
   criteria than the destination address in the packet, which is used to
   lookup an entry in the routing table.

   The PBR problem can be viewed as a resource allocation problem that
   incorporates business decision with routing.  PBR may be used to

Internet-Draft                IM for policy                 October 2014


   provide many benefits, including better resource allocation, load
   balancing and QoS.

   Routing decisions in PBR are based on several criteria beyond
   destination address, such as application, IP protocol used, identity
   of the end system, and even packet size.  Policy actions are
   typically applied before applying QoS constraints since policy
   actions may overrides QoS constraint.

   The I2RS use cases which benefit from PBR are: Protocol independent
   Use cases and large flow use cases described in
   [I-D.hares-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary]

   The PBR policies are specified in most routers/switches as an ordered
   set of rules.  Each policy rule has a set of match conditions, and a
   set of actions which may include forwarding actions and QoS actions.
   Since policy rules, groups of policy, and ordered sets of policy are
   used in other protocols (BGP or MPLS), these policy rules have been
   abstracted into a basic network policy instantiation of the PCIM
   ([RFC3060], [RFC3460], and [RFC3644]).  This instantiation include in
   the ordered policy rule the references to other policy match-action
   conditions such as the ACLs ([I-D.bogdanovic-netmod-acl-model]), and
   Prefix list ([I-D.zhdankin-netmod-bgp-cfg]).

3.1.  Scope

   A PBR IM can be considered in either a top-down view examining the
   policy which controls the data flow or from a bottom-up view which
   considers the data plane.  A top-down view considers how policies
   control protocols (BGP or IGPs (ISIS/OSPF)) transfer of routes to
   determine how data flows.  The bottoms-up view considers the
   forwarding data planes that must be supported.  In this view,the
   match filters must consider IP [both IPv4 and IPv6], but may also
   consider MPLS and encapsulated protocols such as TCP [RFC0793], UDP
   [RFC0768], STCP [RFC4960], ICMP [RFC0792].  This draft takes the
   bottoms-up viewpoint which looks at how the PBR RIB controls the data
   plane.

   This draft considers match and action filters for the data-planes
   using IP (both IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPV6 [RFC2460]).

4.  PBR-RIB module

   A PBR-RIB is an entity that contains an ordered set of policy routes
   and is analogous to a RIB defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].
   An ordered set of policy routes implies that the insertion into a
   PBR-RIB must allow for inserting of a PBR route at any specific
   position and deleting a route at a specific position.  The ability to

Internet-Draft                IM for policy                 October 2014


   change a policy rule at a specific position combines these two
   functions (deleting an existing policy rule and adding a new policy
   rule).

   Each PBR-RIB is contained within a routing instance, but one routing
   instance (named by an INSTANCE_NAME) can contain multiple PBR RIBs.
   Each routing instance is associated with a set of interfaces, a
   router-id a PBR default-RIB, and list of PBR-RIBs.  Only some of the
   interfaces associated with a routing instance may be associated with
   a PBR-RIB.  Each interface can be associated with at most one PBR
   RIB.

   Packets arriving on an interface associated with a PBR-RIB will be
   forwarded based on a PBR-RIB in the list or PBR Default RIB (if no
   matches occur).  The policy processing within the PBR process within
   the routing system is expected to do the following:

   o  When a packet successfully matches a PBR Match term/entry, the
      corresponding policy-actions are applied.

   o  If a packet does not match a PBR match term/entry, the PBR
      processing, goes to the next term/entry in the order, and looks
      for a match, within the current filter or goes to the next filter
      in the list.  This continues until either a PBR match term/entry
      is successfully matched, or no more filters in the list exists.

   o  If no match has been found within the PBR filter list, then the
      packet will be forwarded using the PBR Default-RIB if one exists.
      If no PBR Default-RIB is specified, the packet will be discarded.

      *  pbr-group-policy - group policy list indexed by group-policy-
         ref number.  Policy group contains a reference number (group-
         policy-ref), name, status-info, and a list of policy-rules. the
         group policy status can be one of the following: installed,
         active, inactive, I2RS-active, and I2RS-inactive).  The
         inactive reason can be one of the following: null, poicy-
         conflict, i2rs-supersedes, unsupported).

      *  pbr-policy-set - policy set identified by name

   Initially, it is expected the simply group policy list will be
   sufficient.  (See [I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-info-model] for an examples of
   the policy rules can contain ACL policy, Prefix-list policy, and more
   complex (match/set) policy.)

   The policy-rule contains the following:

   o  PBR-match-filter - ordered PBR match field for a route entry which
      contains either:

      *  nr-policy-match - order number in match sequence

      *  pbr-ipv4-matches - one or more matches of IPv4 source address,
         IPv4 destination address, IPv4 Protocol, IPv4 TOS/DSCP field,
         IPv4 ICMP field, and the length of the packet.  These matches
         can be exact matches, longest prefix matches for addresses, or
         range matches for values in TOS/DSCP field, ICMP field or
         length of packet.

      *  pbr-iv6-matches - one or more match of IPv6 source address,
         IPv6 destination address, IPvs Traffic class (DSCP), IPv6 Flow
         label, IPv6 payload length, IPv6 next-header, hop-limit.  These

         matches can be exact matches, longest prefix matches for
         addresses, or range matches.

      *  pbr-transport-matches - one or more matches in source port or
         destination port

      *  pbr-combo-operator - logical OR or logical AND that combine
         matches in one match filter.

   o  pbr-rule-action* - An ordered list of policy actions that includes
      the following:

      *  npbr-acts - order number in action sequence

      *  Actions: set values in one or more of the following:

         +  IPv4 packets in IPv4 source address, IPv4 destination
            address, IPv4 Protocol, IPv4 TOS/DSCP field, IPv4 ICMP field
            or the length of the packet.  (Please note that hardware
            data plane forwarders may only be able to set TOS/DSCP while
            software data plane forwarders may be able set additional
            fields.)

         +  IPv6 packets in IPv6 source address, IPv6 destination
            address, IPv6 Protocol value, IPv6 Flow, or IPv6 packet
            length.

      *  pbr-forwarding-actions - which includes

         +  pbr-std-forwarding - (enumeration) forwarding packet

            -  Drop_Packet - drop packet

            -  Drop_Packet_ICMP - dropping packet with ICMP unreachable
               sent

            -  Forward_Packet_default - forward based on PBR Default RIB

         +  pbr-vendor-fwd - Vendor specific action

4.3.  I2RS PRB RIB interaction with PBR RIB

   The I2RS client-agent pair PBR process within a routing process to
   add ephemeral these changes to the PBR State so that

   PBR-running = PBR-config + PBR-I2RS-ephemeral

   The I2RS ephemeral state will not survive a reboot of the machine.
   Upon a reboot, the I2RS client must reload the I2RS Agent with the
   I2RS PBR RIB state lost in the reboot.

   The PBR RIB module must allow both the I2RS client-agent to to read
   the PBR IM as as query or as a notification stream.  The pbr-update-
   ref parameter of the PBR-status-info provides an update count for the
   PBR configuration to indicate if the PBR has been updated with
   additions or deletions of the PBR policy rules.  This provides the
   I2RS interface a quick way to check for changes by other entities to
   the PBR route list.

5.  Relationship between PBR Rule Model and RIB Information Model

   The RIB in a router with I2RS is the following:

   running RIB = configured-RIB + routes-installed-from-protocols +
   I2RS-ephemeral-state

   As described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model], the I2RS ephemeral
   RIB information in routing instance contains a collection of RIBs,
   interfaces, and routing parameters including the following:

   o  The set of interfaces indicates which interfaces are associated
      with this routing instance.

   o  The RIBs specify how incoming traffic is to be forwarded based on
      destination (E.g.  RIB and PBR-RIB).

   o  The routing parameters control the information in the RIBs.

   PBR RIB and RIB can not be used at the same time, which means:

   o  If a router doesn't support policy based routing, a router MUST
      use RIB and MUST not use PBR RIB.

   o  If a router supports policy based routing:

      *  PBR-RIB is used

      *  Multiple PBR-RIBs may exist within a routing instance

      *  An interface can be associated with at most one PBR-RIB

      *  The PBR Default RIB is used if several criteria beyond
         destination address is not matched.

6.  Discussion of I2RS related issues

   This section record the issues with the initials of the person who
   recorded it.

   Forwarding per interface (JMH)

      - The authors believe the forwarding per interface is covered by
      the attachment of a PBR to interface-list.

   Centralized or Distributed Policy Strategy (JMH)

      The authors believe this structure can be used by either
      centralized or distributed forwarding for configuration or the
      I2RS ephemeral datastpre.

   policy database-enforcement points architecture (JMH)

      The authors believe this yang modules describes the PBR which
      provides a specific enforcement of forwarding policy.  The wider
      constraints of how policy groups are stored, administered or
      distributed should be engaged at a higher layer.  The authors note
      the Policy-Group project in OpenDaylight has an architecture for
      policy enforcement that renders the results to a particular
      instantiation in nodes.  One such instantiation could be the I2RS
      policy.

   policy rule conflicts (JMH)

      Detection of policy rule conflicts are done by the policy module
      receiving the configuration or ephemeral I2RS stream.  The policy
      can be reject or installed and rejected from active use due to
      conflicts at either the policy group level or the policy rule
      level.  At the policy group level the group-policy-status-info
      contains a status of installed, active, or installed-inactive.  If
      the status is inactive the group-policy-inactive-reason can
      indicate policy-conflicts.  The policy-rule has a similar status
      (policy-rule-status-info with policy-rule-status and policy-rule-
      inactive-reason).
