Abstract 

   This document describes a framework comprised of few scenarios and 
   associated requirements where PW redundancy is needed. A set of 
   redundant PWs is configured between PE nodes in SS-PW applications, 
   or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications. In order for the PE/T-PE 
   nodes to indicate the preferred PW to forward to one another, a new 
   status is needed to indicate the preferential forwarding status of 
   active or standby for each PW in the redundancy set.

1. Terminology  

   o Active PW.  A PW whose preferential status is set to Active and 
      Operational status is UP and is used for forwarding user and OAM 
      traffic.

   o Standby PW. A PW whose preferential status is set to Standby and 
      Operational status is UP and is not used for forwarding user 
      traffic but may forward OAM traffic.  

   o PW Endpoint: A PE where a PW terminates on a point where Native 
      Service Processing is performed, e.g., A SS-PW PE, an MS-PW T-PE, 
      or an H-VPLS MTU-s or PE-rs. 

   o Primary PW: the PW which a PW endpoint activates in preference to 
      any other PW when more than one PW qualify for active state. When 
      the primary PW comes back up after a failure and qualifies for 
      active state, the PW endpoint always reverts to it. The 
      designation of Primary is performed by local configuration for 
      the PW at the PE.  

   o Secondary PW: when it qualifies for active state, a Secondary PW 
      is only selected if no Primary PW is configured or if the 
      configured primary PW does not qualify for active state (e.g., is 
      DOWN). By default, a PW in a redundancy PW set is considered 
      secondary. There is no Revertive mechanism among secondary PWs. 

   o Revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
      primary PW if it is Operationally UP and the wait-to-restore 
      timer expires and primary PW is made the Active PW. 

   o Non-revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
      the last PW  selected as a result of previous active PW entering 
      Operationally DOWN state.   

   o Manual selection of PW . Ability for the operator to manually 
      select the primary/secondary PWs.    

   This document uses the term 'PE' to be synonymous with both PEs as 
           per RFC3985 and T-PEs as per RFC5659. 

   This document uses the term 'PW' to be synonymous with both PWs as

2. Introduction 

   In single-segment PW (SS-PW) applications, protection for the PW is 
   provided by the PSN layer. This may be an Resource Reservation 
   Protocol traffic engineered (RSVP-TE) labeled switch (LSP) with a 
   fast-Reroute (FRR) backup and/or an end-to-end backup LSP. There are

   applications however where the backup PW terminates on a different 
   target PE node. PSN protection mechanisms cannot protect against 
   failure of the target PE node or the failure of the remote AC.  

   In multi-segment PW (MS-PW) applications, a primary and one or more 
   secondary PWs in standby mode are configured in the network. The 
   paths of these PWs are diverse in the sense that they are switched at 
   different S-PE nodes. In these applications, PW redundancy is 
   important for the service resilience.  

   In some deployments, it is important for operators that particular PW 
   is preferred if it is available. For example, PW path with least 
   latency may be preferred.   

   This document describes framework for these applications and its 
   associated operational requirements. The framework comprises of new 
   required status called preferential status to PW apart from the 
   operational status already defined in the PWE3 control protocol [2].  

    

3. Reference Model  

   Following figures shows the reference architecture of PE for the PW 
   redundancy and its usage in different topologies and applications. 

    

3.1. PE Architecture 

   Figure 1 shows the PE architecture for PW redundancy, when more than 
   one PW in a redundant set is associated with a single AC. This is 
   based on the architecture in Figure 4b of RFC3985 [3]. The forwarder 
   selects which of the redundant PWs to using the criteria described in 
   this document.

   In the Figure 2 illustrated above both CEs, CE1 and CE2 are dual- 
   homed with PEs, PE1, PE2 and PE3, PE4 respectively. The method for 
   dual-homing and the used protocols are outside the scope of this 
   document.  Note that the PSN tunnels are not shown in this figure for 
   clarity. However, it can be assumed that each of the PWs shown is 
   encapsulated in a separate PSN tunnel. 

   PE1 has PW1 and PW4 service connecting PE3 and PE4 respectively. 
   Similarly PE2 has PW2 and Pw3 pseudo wire service connecting PE4 and

   PE3 respectively. PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4 are all operationally UP. In 
   order to support N:1 or 1:1 only one PW is required to be selected to 
   forward the traffic. Thus the PW needs to reflect its new status 
   apart from the operational status. We call this as preferential 
   forwarding status with state representing 'active' the one carrying 
   traffic while the other 'standby' which is operationally UP but not 
   forwarding traffic. The method of deriving Active/Standby status of 
   the AC is outside the scope of this document.  

   A new algorithm needs to be developed using the preferential 
   forwarding state of PW and select only one PW to forward.  

   On failure of AC between the dual homed CE1 in this case lets say PE1 
   the preferential status on PE2 needs to be changed. Different 
   mechanisms/protocols can be used to achieve this and these are beyond 
   the scope of this document. After the change in status the algorithm 
   for selection of PW needs to revaluate and select PW to forward the 
   traffic. In this application, because each dual-homing algorithm 
   running on the two node sets, i.e., {CE1, PE1, PE2} and {CE2, PE3, 
   PE4}, selects the active AC independently, there is a need to signal 
   the active status of the AC such that the PE nodes can select a 
   common active PW path for end-to-end forwarding between CE1 and CE2. 
   This helps in restricting the changes occurring on one side of 
   network due to failure to the other side of the network.  

   Also the failures in the carrier core network MUST NOT be propagated 
   to customer network. Hence network operator should take this 
   consideration while designing the network. For ex. if there is 
   failure of LSP tunnel, operator should have rely on FRR or an 
   alternate LSP path/tunnel which will be seamless to the PW service. 
   Note this method also protects against any single PE failure or some 
   dual PE failures.  

   One Multi-homed CE with single SS-PW redundancy application is a 
   subset of above. Only PW1 and PW3 exist in this case. This helps 
   against AC failure and PE failure of dual homed AC. Similar 
   requirements applies in usage MS-PW redundancy as well. An additional 
   requirement applicable to MS-PW is forwarding of status notification 
   through S-PE. In general from customer view, SS-PW and MS-PW has 
   similar resiliency requirement. 

   There is also a 1:1 protection switching case that is a subset of the 
   above where PW3 and PW4 are not present.  

   o If the CEs do not perform native service protection switching, but 
      instead may use load balancing. This protects against AC failures 
      and can use the native service to indicate active/failed state.

   o If each CE homes to different PEs, then the CEs can implement 
      native service protection switching, without any PW redundancy 
      functions. All that the PW needs to do is detect AC, PE, or PSN 
      tunnel failures and convey that information to both PEs at the end 
      of the PW. This is applicable to MS-PW as well.

   Figure 3 Single homed CE with multi-segment pseudo-wire redundancy 

   In Figure 3, CE1 is connected to PE1 in provider Edge 1 and CE2 to 
   PE2 in provider edge 2 respectively. There are three segmented PWs. A  
   PW1, is switched at S-PE1, PW2, which is switched at S-PE2 and PW3, 
   is switched at S-PE3. 

   Since there is no multi-homing running on the AC, the T-PE nodes 
   would advertise 'Active' for the forwarding status based on the 
   priority. Priorities associate meaning of 'primary PW' and 'secondary 
   PW'. These priorities MUST be used in revertive mode as well and 
   paths must be switched accordingly. The priority can be configuration 
   or derivation from the PWid. Lower the PWid higher the priority. 
   However, this does not guarantee selection of same PW by the T-PEs 
   because, for example, mismatch of the configuration of the PW

   priority in each T-PE. The intent of this application is to have T-
   PE1 and T-PE2 synchronize the transmit and receive path of the PW 
   over the network. In other words, both T-PE nodes are required to 
   transmit over the PW segment which is switched by the same S-PE. This 
   is desirable for ease of operation and troubleshooting.  

      

3.4. PW redundancy between MTU-s  

   Following figure illustrates the application of use of PW redundancy

               Figure 4  Multi-homed MTU-s in H-VPLS core                   

   In Figure 4, MTU-s is dual homed to PE1 and PE2 and has spoke PWs to 
   each of them. MTU-s needs to choose only one of the spoke PW (active 
   PW) to one of the PE to forward the traffic and the other to standby 
   status. MTU-s can derive the status of the PWs based on local policy 
   configuration. PE1 and PE2 are connected to H-VPLS core on the other 
   side of network. MTU-s communicates the status of its member PWs for 
   a set of VSIs having common status Active/Standby. Here MTU-s 
   controls the selection of PWs to forward the traffic. Signaling  
   using PW grouping with common group-id in PWid FEC Element or 
   Grouping TLV in Generalized PWid FEC Element as defined in [2] to PE1 
   and PE2 respectively, is encouraged to scale better.   

   Whenever MTU-s performs a switchover, it needs to communicate to PE2 
   for the Standby PW group the changed status of active.

   the H-VPLS full mesh. By default, MTU-s devices should still trigger 
   MAC Withdraw messages as currently defined in [5] to prevent two 
   copies of MAC withdraws to be sent (one by MTU-s and another one by 
   PEs). Mechanisms to disable MAC Withdraw trigger in certain devices 
   is out of the scope of this document. 

3.5. PW redundancy between n-PEs  

   Following figure illustrates the application of use of PW redundancy 
   for dual homed connectivity between PE devices in a ring topology.

             |  PE1  |=====================|  PE2  |====...      

             +-------+    PW Group 1       +-------+

             +-------+                     +-------+        

             |  PE3  |=====================|  PE4  |==... 

             +-------+    PW Group 2       +-------+ 

                 Figure 5   Redundancy in Ring topology                

   In Figure 5, PE1 and PE3 from VPLS domain A are connected to PE2 and 
   PE4 in VPLS domain B via PW group 1 and group 2. Each of the PE in 
   respective domain is connected to each other as well to form the ring 
   topology. Such scenarios may arise in inter-domain H-VPLS deployments 
   where RSTP or other mechanisms may be used to maintain loop free 
   connectivity of PW groups. 

   Ref.[5] outlines about multi-domain VPLS service without specifying 
   how redundant border PEs per domain per VPLS instance can be 
   supported. In the example above, PW group1 may be blocked at PE1 by 
   RSTP and it is desirable to block the group at PE2 by virtue of 
   exchanging the PW preferential status as Standby. How the PW grouping 
   should be done here is again deployment specific and is out of scope 
   of the solution.

                         Figure 6 Bridge Module Model 

   In Figure 6, two provider access networks, each having two n-PEs, 
   where the n-PEs are connected via a full mesh of PWs for a given VPLS 
   instance. As shown in the figure, only one n-PE in each access 
   network is serving as a Primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and the 
   other n-PE is serving as the backup PE (B).In this figure, each 
   primary PE has two active PWs originating from it. Therefore, when a 
   multicast, broadcast, and unknown unicast frame arrives at the 
   primary n-PE from the access network side, the n-PE replicates the 
   frame over both PWs in the core even though it only needs to send the 
   frames over a single PW (shown with == in the figure) to the primary 
   n-PE on the other side. This is an unnecessary replication of the

   customer frames that consumes core-network bandwidth (half of the 
   frames get discarded at the receiving n-PE). This issue gets 
   aggravated when there is three or more n-PEs per provider, access 
   network. For example if there are three n-PEs or four n-PEs per 
   access network, then 67% or 75% of core-BW for multicast, broadcast 
   and unknown unicast are respectively wasted.   

   In this scenario, n-PEs can disseminate the status of PWs 
   active/standby among themselves and furthermore to have it tied up 
   with the redundancy mechanism such that per VPLS instance the status 
   of active/backup n-PE gets reflected on the corresponding PWs 
   emanating from that n-PE. 

4. Generic PW redundancy requirements 

4.1. Protection switching requirements 

   o Protection architecture such as N:1,1:1 or 1+1 can be used. N:1 
      protection case is somewhat inefficient in terms of capacity 
      consumption hence implementations SHOULD support this method 
      while  1:1 being subset and efficient MUST be supported. 1+1 
      protection architecture can be supported but is left for further 
      study. 

   o Non-revertive mode MUST be supported, while revertive mode is an 
      optional one.  

   o Protection switchover can be operator driven like Manual 
      lockout/force switchover or due to signal failure. Both methods 
      MUST be supported and signal failure MUST be given higher 
      priority than any local or far end request. 

4.2.  Operational requirements 

   o (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
      and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
      primary/secondary PW.  

   o (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
      and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
      revertive/non-revertive protection switching mode.   

   o (T-)PEs that do not automatically discover or resolve 
      inconsistencies in the configuration of primary/secondary, 
      revertive/non-revertive, or other parameters MUST generate an 
      alarm upon detection of an inconsistent configuration.

   o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching MUST support the 
      configuration of revertive or non-revertive protection switching 
      mode. 

   o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
      local invocation of protection switching. 

   o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
      local invocation of a lockout of protection switching.   

   o In standby status PW can still receive packets in order to avoid 
      black holing of in-flight packets during switchover. However in 
      case of use of VPLS application packets are dropped in standby 
      status except for the OAM packets.   

    

5. Security Considerations  

   This document expects extensions to LDP that are needed for 
   protecting pseudo-wires. It will have the same security properties as 
   in LDP [4] and the PW control protocol [2]. 

6. IANA considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.
