Abstract

   The HOKEY WG is developing solutions for optimizations as well as
   security key hierarchy specifications for handovers.  The key
   derivation specifications all draw from a trust relationship that is
   created as a result of a "2-party" EAP authentication between a peer
   and a backend server, while distributing the resulting keys to third
   parties other than the peer and the backend server.  This document
   describes problem statement and requirements on a three-party key
   distribution protocol for handover keyings.

1.  Introduction

   This is my time tabe for the week:

   Monday to Friday  working

   Saturday and Sunday  working

   The HOKEY (Handover Keying) WG is specifying solutions for secure
   handover optimization relating to EAP (Extensible Authentication
   Protocol) [RFC3748].  The optimization solutions under considerations
   can for instance be categorized based on timing: The authentication
   and key management may occur before handoff, or alternatively,
   authentication and key management can occur as part of the handoff.
   Furthermore, HOKEY is specifying key derivation mechanisms that can
   be applied to generic use cases.  All of these key derivation
   mechanisms have one thing in common; from security standpoint, the
   solutions have one thing in common: they draw from a trust
   relationship that is created as a result of a "2-party" EAP
   authentication between a peer and a backend server.  On the other
   hand, the key management solutions are distributing the resulting
   keys to the third parties other than the initial peer and the backend
   server.  This means the key distribution mechanism and protocol,
   unlike the initial authentication, involves 3 parties.

   This document describes problem statement and requirements on such
   three-party key distribution protocols used for handover and other
   keying applications.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     3-Party Key Dist. Problem Statement        March 2007


2.  Problem Statement

   Network access authentication and authorization services have been
   based on two-party trust model (long term credentials established
   between a backend AAA server and an end client) under the assumption
   that the access client and the authentication server (EAP/AAA server)
   mutually authenticate, using a two-party protocol.  Initially a
   network point of presence (e.g. a dial up modem up) performed the
   role of authentication server end-client and thus this point of
   presence was denoted as Network Access Server (NAS).  This was a
   truely two party protocol.

   Eventually authentication and authorization services were then
   extended to be more scalable by separating the authentication
   database from the NAS.  In the extended model, credentials of access
   clients are moved from the NAS to a centralized authentication server
   and a AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) protocol is
   used for communication between the NAS and the authentication server.
   This extension was designed to be transparent to the access clients.
   Now the NAS and authentication server are no longer one.  The network
   point of presence typically provides conditional connectivity to the
   end client while the client and the backend server perform the
   authentication.

               | EAP   |------------------------------| EAP/AAA |
               | Peer  |                              |  Server |
               +-+-+-+-+         +-+-+-+-+            +-+-+-+-+-+
                                 | NAS   |
                                 +-+-+-+-+
               Not a party in EAP authentication

     Figure 1: 2-party authentication between EAP peer and EAP server

   The NAS (Network Access Server) has no part in determining the result
   of the authentication and thus this transparency is frequently argued
   [GZ]: the original two-party trust model remains the same.  That is,
   even though there are three distinct entities in this transaction the
   two-party trust model can still be used.

   When the EAP authentication framework is extended to also perform key
   management, the initial two parties (the peer and the EAP server)
   both calculate the so called Master Session Key (MSK) and Extended
   Master Session Key (EMSK) based on the recently acquired state
   resulting from a successful EAP authentication.  However, given that
   the NAS had no part in the EAP authentication, it cannot generate the

   same keying material.  On the other hand, the goal of the EAP keying
   framework is to bootstrap a security association for the peer
   connectivity to the network through the very same NAS.  This means
   either of the two initial parties must transfer the keying material
   resulted from the EAP authentication to the NAS.  Given the
   assumption that the NAS is a trusted part of the network controlled
   by the Authentication server, it is typically the authentication
   server that distributes the keying material resulted from the EAP
   authentication to the NAS.  Thus the key distribution mechanism
   governing the network connectivity security bootstrapping is now a
   true 3-party mechanism.

           Figure 2: 3-party key distribution involving the NAS

   Problems with using a two-party trust model on this transaction have
   been noted [RFC3748] and are generally referred to as a problem with
   "Channel Binding".  Basically the access peer infers the identity of
   the authenticator but has no direct indication of the identity of the
   entity to whom the authentication server transmitted the keying
   material.  In other words, in an unintended situation, when a NAS is
   impersonating another NAS, the peer and the authentication server may
   have two different view of the NAS identity.  A comprehensive
   solution to this problem has not been attempted, though, since the
   fallout from an attack is contained.  The key sent by the
   authentication server to the NAS-- the MSK (Master Session Key)--
   will be the same whether the NAS impersonates another NAS or not
   [I-D.ietf-eap-keying].  A re-authentication between the access client
   and the authentication server (possibly as part a handoff from one
   NAS to another) can somewhat limit exposure of the problem, however,
   it does not solve the problem completely, since potentially the lying
   NAS can impersonate the new NAS as well.  This although difficult
   from the access link side, can be easier from the network side, when
   for instance a compromised AAA proxy is on the path between both of
   the NASes and the authentication server, and can observe both the EAP
   signaling and the AAA signaling carrying the keying material.

   Handover keying involves transmission of other keying material in a
   protocol involving three parties-- the access peer, a HOKEY server

   and an authenticator to which a handover will be performed.  In a
   roaming scenario, the three main parties are: the access peer, the
   HOKEY server in a home domain, and a HOKEY server in a visited
   domain.  The problem seems to stem from the fact that the transferred
   keying material is not properly scoped and the key scope is not
   properly enforced.  Keying material with a specific scope (intended
   parties to share the key) will be made available to another entity,
   and problems arise when the peer does not have a direct indication of
   the identity of that entity.  An impersonation attack could result in
   keying material for one scope bound to one entity being delivered to
   another entity outside that scope.  Obviously, the two-party trust
   model is not applicable to the handover keying case.

3.  Requirements

   Basic requirements on a 3-party key distribution protocol for
   handover keying is listed below.

   1.  Confidentiality -- disclosure of the keying material to passive
       and active attackers of the key distribution protocol MUST NOT be
       possible.

   2.  Integrity protection -- it MUST be possible to detect tampering
       of a network access credential.

   3.  Validation of credential source -- the recipient of a network
       access credential MUST be able to prove who it came from and for
       what context the credential was delivered.

   4.  Validation of authorization -- the scope (intended users) of the
       network access credential MUST be distributed as part of the
       credential and MUST be protected to the same degree as the
       credential itself.  The context (life time, labels, intended
       usage, etc) of the network access credentials MUST be distributed
       as part of the credentials and MUST be protected to the same
       degree.

   5.  Resilience -- It MUST NOT be possible for an active attacker to
       consent of the client.

   6.  Peer consent -- Either the credential MUST NOT be distributed
       without the consent of the client or it MUST be unusable without
       the consent of the client.

   7.  Verification of identity -- Identities of the three parties
       involved MUST be confirmed by all three parties.

   8.  Agreement by all parties -- If the protocol successfully
       completes all three parties MUST agree on the keying material
       disclosed and the identity of the entity to whom the keying
       material was disclosed.

   9.  Replay protection -- replay attacks MUST NOT effect the key
       distribution protocol.

Internet-Draft     3-Party Key Dist. Problem Statement        March 2007


4.  Solution Framework for HOKEY 3-Party Key Distribution Protocol

   Following, we present two different main cases that need to be
   considered in the handover keying problem.

4.1.  Use Cases

   Use Case 1 principals: EAP peer, HOKEY server and EAP server

      In this scenario, the HOKEY server is not co-located with the EAP
      server.  That is, the EAP server and HOKEY server are considered
      as two completely different parties.  The 3-Party Key Distribution
      protocol is aimed for distributing a shared key Kab between the
      HOKEY peer and HOKEY server where the EAP server is acting as
      server distributing the session key Kab.

   Use Case 2 principals: EAP peer, authenticator and HOKEY server

      In this scenario, the HOKEY peer and the HOKEY server already owns
      a shared secret Kas (e.g. the HOKEY server is the EAP server).
      The 3-Party Key Distribution protocol is aimed for distributing a
      shared key Kab between the HOKEY peer and the authenticator where
      the HOKEY server is acting as server distributing the Kab. Note
      that when HOKEY peer and HOKEY server do not share any key, Case 1
      needs to be performed before going through Case 2.

4.2.  Notation

   A: HOKEY client in both Use Cases 1 and 2
   B: HOKEY server in Use Case 1 or Authenticator in Use Case 2
   S: EAP server in Use Case 1 or HOKEY server in Use Case 2

   {X}K: X encrypted with key K
   [X]K: Message Authentication Code of X with key K.
   H(x): Digest produced from a one-way hash function given x as input
   x|y: Concatenation of x and y


   Kas: A symmetric key shared between A and S
   Kbs: A symmetric key shared between B and S
   Kab: A symmetric key to be shared between A and B
   L :  Key lifetime for Kab

   Tx : Timestamp generated by the party X
   Nx : Nonce provided by the party X

Internet-Draft     3-Party Key Dist. Problem Statement        March 2007


4.3.  Candidate 3-Party Key Distribution Protocols

   We present a set of candidate 3-Party Key Distribution protocols that
   may be considered suitable for deploying a handover keying solution.
   Note that there are other protocols that may be well considered as
   candidates [prot-auth].  Note also that, in this version of document
   no verification has been made as to whether the candidate protocols
   satisfy the requirements listed in Section 3.

   It is assumed for all candidate protocols that when Kab is encrypted
   in a message, authorization attributes associated with Kab are also
   encrypted together.  However, the authorization attributes are not
   shown in the diagram of each candidate protocol.

4.3.1.  Kerberos Protocol

   1) A->S: A, B
   2) S->A: {Ts, L, Kab, B, {Ts, L, Kab, A}Kbs}Kas
   3) A->B: {Ts, L, Kab, A}Kbs, {A, Ta}Kab
   4) B->A: {Ta+1}Kab

   Kerberos protocol is based on Needham-Schroeder protocol but
   following the recommendations given by Denning and Sacco [ds-time].
   That is, they use timestamps to avoid replay attacks.  Additionally,
   S includes a lifetime L associated to the distributed key Kab. The
   last message 4 allows mutual authentication between A and B and it is
   optional.  In Kerberos v5, Ta+1 in the 4-th message is replaced with
   Ta and other information [RFC4120].

   Additionally, Kerberos allows the client A to obtain an initial
   ticket to access a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) without requiring
   the user to re-entry the password.  That initial ticket allows the
   client A to start a Kerberos negotiation with TGS to obtain another
   ticket for accessing the service B.

   By using this approach, Kerberos also allows a cross-realm operation
   where A can recover a ticket from a remote TGS (in A's Home Domain)
   to access a local TGS (in the visited domain).

   However, Kerberos requires time synchronization among the three
   parties.

4.3.2.  ISO/IEC 11770-2 Key Establishment Mechanism 10

   1) A->S: {Ta,B}Kas
   2) S->A: {Ts,Kab,B}Kas
   3) S->B: {Ts',Kab,A}Kbs




Harkins, et al.         Expires September 5, 2007               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     3-Party Key Dist. Problem Statement        March 2007


   This protocol has an interesting feature because it allows S to
   verify the authenticity and freshness of the first message before
   starting the key distribution process.  The protocol requires that
   time synchronization among the three entities.

4.3.3.  An Improved Provably Secure 3PKD protocol

   1)  A->B: Na
   2)  B->S: Na,Nb
   3a) S->A: {Kab}Kas,[A,B,Na,Nb,Ns,{Kab}Kas]Kas,Nb
   3b) S->B: {Kab}Kbs,[A,B,Na,Nb,Ns,{Kab}Kbs]Kbs

   The original protocol 3PKD was proposed by Bellare and Rogaway in
   [3pkd].  However, Choo et al. presented a small modification to the
   protocol by adding the value Nb and a nonce generated by the server S
   (Ns) which avoids A and B to accept two different session keys (e.g.
   Kab, Kab') for the same session [3pkd-choo].

   Basically, with the inclusion of Ns, the protocol defines as session
   formed by the 3-tuple (Na,Nb,Ns).  However as we may see the protocol
   does not consider mutual authentication.

4.3.4.  Dan Harkins' protocol (tentative)

   1) A->B: A, {A, B, Na}Kas
   2) B->S: A, B, {Nb}Kbs, {A, B, Na}Kas
   3) S->B: {Na, Nt, B}Kas, {A, Na, Nb, Nt, Kab}Kbs
   4) B->A: {Na, Nt, B}Kas, H(Na|Nt)

   In this protocol, A and B derive Kab from Kas using the same key
   derivation function.  Therefore, there is no need to carry Kab in
   message 4.

4.4.  Candidate Key Distribution Transport Protocols

   The protocols presented in Section 4.3 are independent on the
   protocol used to transport the different messages exchanged among the
   the principals.

   Several alternatives are identified as transport protocols for a
   3-party key distribution protocol.  This version of document does not
   make any recommendation on a specific transport protocol.

   o  Lower-layer specific transport (e.g., new link-layer management
      frames and new AAA attributes).  The HOKEY scope limits the
      definition of the lower-layer to an IP protocol

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo discusses basic requirements to secure the distribution of
   keying material in HOKEY.  Security requirements are placed on the
   key distribution protocol itself and not on the transport used to
   distribute the keying material.  A compliant implementation SHOULD be
   able to run over any transport.

Appendix A.  Protocols not being considered as candidates due to known
             flaws

   Following we present a set of protocols which have recognized flaws
   but they serve as basis to other protocols.

Appendix A.1.  Otway-Rees

   1) A->B: M, A, B, {M, A, B, Na}Kas
   2) B->S: M, A, B, {M, A, B, Na}Kas,{M, A, B, Nb}Kbs
   3) S->B: M,{Na, Kab}Kas, {Nb, Kab}Kbs
   4) B->A: M,{Na, Kab}Kas

   The protocol adds a value M as session number but has a flaw.  In
   fact, a replay attack is possible by malicious intruder which can end
   up with arranging different keys for A and B [or-attack].

Appendix A.2.  Wide Mouth Frog

   1) A->S: A,{Ta, Kab, B}Kas
   2) S->B: {Ts, Kab, A}Kbs

   This simple protocol shows a flaw where an attacker may force to B to
   accept an old session key Kab by sending and updated message 2 (with
   a new Ts) [prot-auth].

Appendix A.3.  Needham-Schroeder Shared Key Protocol

   1) A->S: A, B, Na
   2) S->A: {Na, Kab, B, {Kab, A}Kbs}Kas
   3) A->B: {Kab, A}Kbs
   4) B->A: {Nb}Kab
   5) A->B: {Nb-1}Kab

   This protocol has a flaw where an attacker can launch a replay attack
   when Kab is compromized.  The attacker can use the same Kab for
   different sessions.
