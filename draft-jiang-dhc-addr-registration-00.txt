Abstract 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, node self-generated 
   addresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address 
   architecture. These addresses need to be registered in the networking 
   management plate for the purposes of central address administration. 
   This document extends Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 
   (DHCPv6) and Router Advertisement to enable the address registration 
   processing from nodes to network management.

1. Introduction & Motivation 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, node self-generated 
   addresses, such as addresses in IPv6 Stateless Address Configuration 
   [RFC4862, RFC4941] scenario and Cryptographically Generated Addresses 
   (CGA, [RFC3972]), is notionally conflicted with the network managed 
   address architecture, such as DHCPv6-managed network or network with 
   Access Control List, in which addresses are assigned and managed by 
   the network management plate. 

   The current IPv4 address allocation mode in DHCPv4-managed network is 
   that the DHCPv4 server assigns addresses. Many operators of 
   enterprise networks and similarly tightly administered networks have 
   expressed the desire to hold on to this model when moving to IPv6, 
   because they don't want to have hosts end up with essentially random 
   IPv6 addresses. However, the notion that a server assigns an address 
   is for the most part incompatible with IPv6 stateless configuration. 

   A useful way to give network administrators most of what they want, 
   while at the same time retaining compatibility with normal stateless 
   configuration would be: if the self-generated IPv6 addresses are used, 
   they may need to be registered in and granted by the networking 
   management plate. The node may be required to perform this 
   registration since only granted IPv6 addresses are allowed to be used 
   to access the network. 

   This document extends Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 
   (DHCPv6) and Router Advertisement to propagate the address 
   registration request from network management to nodes. A new Router 
   Advertisement option and a new DHCPv6 option are defined. Two 
   existing DHCPv6 options are re-used in the address registration 
   interaction from nodes to network management. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Address Registration through DHCPv6 

   By current default, the nodes with self-generated addresses do not 
   register their addresses to any network devices. However, this may 
   result that the network may reject the access request from these 
   devices.

   As showed in below Figure 1, in the generic address registration 
   procedure, the network management plate should firstly propagate the 
   request of registering self-generated addresses. By received such 
   requests, a node using the self-generated address should send an 
   address registration message to the network management. The network 
   management should check whether the requested address is accepted, 
   for example, performing a Duplicated Address Detect or checking the 
   address does not use the Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers 
   [RFC5453]. If the requested address is accepted by the network 
   management, it is registered in the address manage database, which 
   may be used by other network functions, such as DNS or ACL. An 
   acknowledgement is sent to the node, granting the usage of this 
   address. If the requested address is not accepted by the network 
   management, a rejected acknowledgement is sent to the node to 
   indicate that it must generate a new address.

              |----------------------------------------->| 

                Figure 1: address registration procedure 

   The request of registering self-generated addresses can be carried in 
   either DHCPv6 messages or Router Advertisement, but both need to 
   define new options. The registration requests can use DHCPv6 protocol 
   with the existing DHCPv6 options. The current DHCPv6 protocol allows 
   for a host to communicate a set of "preferred" addresses to the 
   server by listing these addresses in IA options [RFC3315]. In order 
   to response to registration requests, an acknowledgement DHCPv6 
   option should be defined, too. 

   Among the mechanisms in which configuration parameters could be 
   pushed to the end hosts and self-generated addresses sent back to a 
   central administration, we discuss the stateful configuration 
   mechanism based on DCHPv6 in this document. Other mechanisms may also 
   provide similar functions, but out of scope.

4. New Options 

4.1. Address Registry Request Option for Router Advertisement  

   Address Registration Request Option (AR_REG) for Router Advertisement 
   [RFC4861] is broadcasted by a router to request hosts to register 
   their self-generated address(es), if there are any, to a certain 
   DHCPv6 server.

                       option (including the Type and Length fields) is 
                       in units of 8 octets. 

       Reserved        A 48-bit field reserved for future use. The 
                       value MUST be initialized to zero by the sender, 
                       and MUST be ignored by the receiver. 

       DHCPv6 Server Address  The IPv6 address of the DHCPv6 server that 
                       the client should register its self-generated 
                       address to. This field should be set to all 0, 
                       if do not assign a DHCPv6 server. 

   By receiving this AR_REQ Option, the client MUST register its self-
   generated address(es), if there are any, by sending a DHCPv6 request 
   message that contains IA option(s), in which each self-generated 
   address is listed, to the DHCPv6 server indicated in the AR_REG 
   Option.

4.2. Address Registry Request Option for DHCPv6  

   DHCPv6 Address Registration Request Option (AR_REG) is sent by a 
   DHCPv6 server to request a host to register its self-generated

       option-len      20, length of this option in octets (option-code 
                       and option-len are not included). 

       Acceptance      Indicates whether this IPv6 address are accepted 
                       and registered by the network management or 
                       rejected. 0, accepted; 1, rejected. 

       Reserved        A 24-bit field reserved for future use. The 
                       value MUST be initialized to zero by the sender, 
                       and MUST be ignored by the receiver. 

       IPv6 address    The IPv6 address that this option is associated. 

   Each Address Registration Acknowledgement Option only indicates the 
   acceptance information of one IPv6 address. In order to acknowledge 
   the registration request of multiple addresses, multiple AR_ACK 
   Options are used. 

5. Security Considerations 

   An attacker could generate IPv6 address registration requests in 
   order to exhaust the server resources (or to impact on any other 
   operation that depend on the registration of the address). It is as 
   vulnerable as all other mechanisms based on DHCPv6 to DOS attacks to 
   the server. Proper use of DHCPv6 autoconfiguration facilities 
   [RFC3315], such as AUTH option or Secure DHCP [SDHCP] can prevent 
   these threats. 

   If Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol is used as the security 
   mechanism for ND, all the ND options including RDNSS option are also 
   automatically included in the signatures [RFC3971], so the RDNSS 
   transport is integrity-protected. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option, which 
   must be assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space 
   for ICMPv6 parameters: 

      The Address Registry Request Option (TBA0) for Router 
      Advertisement, described in Section 4.1. 

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options, which must be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 messages:
