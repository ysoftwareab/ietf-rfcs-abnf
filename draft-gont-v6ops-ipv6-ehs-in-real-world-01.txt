1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) allow for the extension of the IPv6
   protocol, and provide support for core functionality such as IPv6
   fragmentation.  However, IPv6 Extension Headers have been deemed to
   present a challenge to IPv6 implementations and networks, and have
   been assumed/known to be intentionally filtered in some existing IPv6
   deployments.

   Discussions over the operational implications of IPv6 extension
   headers and their usability in the public Internet come up over and
   over again at both in IETF circles and other venues, and not

   infrequently some key aspects involving IPv6 extension headers are
   overlooked.

   This document tries raise awareness about the operational
   implications of IPv6 Extension Headers, and their usability in the
   public Internet.  Additionally, it provides some guidance in
   troubleshooting IPv6 blackholes resulting from the filtering of
   packets that employ IPv6 extension headers.  Finally, it aims to
   raise awareness about the operational reality of IPv6 extension
   headers to protocol designers, and trigger discussion within the IETF
   community regarding areas where future work might be required.

   Section 2 of this document summarizes the work that has been done in
   the area of IPv6 extension headers.  Section 3 discusses the
   operational implications of IPv6 Extension Headers.  Section 4
   presents real-world data regarding the extent to which IPv6 Extension
   Headers are usable in the public Internet.  Section 5 provides advise
   to protocol designers regarding the use of IPv6 extension headers,
   and aims to raise awareness about the possible interoperability
   implications on existing protocols.  Finally, Section 6 provides some
   guidance in troubleshooting of problems that may arise as a result of
   filtering packets that employ IPv6 Extension Headers.

2.  Previous Work on IPv6 Extension Headers

   Some of the implications of IPv6 Extension Headers have been
   discussed in IETF circles.  For example, [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop]
   discusses a rationale for which operators filter IPv6 fragments.
   [I-D.wkumari-long-headers] discusses possible issues arising from
   "long" IPv6 header chains.  [RFC7045] clarifies how intermediate
   nodes should deal with IPv6 extension headers.  [RFC7112] discusses
   the issues arising in a specific case where the IPv6 header chain is
   fragmented into two or more fragments (and formally forbids such
   case).  [I-D.kampanakis-6man-ipv6-eh-parsing] describes how
   inconsistencies in the way IPv6 packets with extension headers are
   parsed by different implementations may result in evasion of security
   controls, and presents guidelines for parsing IPv6 extension headers
   with a goal of providing a common and consistent parsing methodology
   for IPv6 implementations.  [RFC6980] analyzes the security
   implications of employing IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery
   for IPv6, and formally recommends against such usage.  Finally,
   [RFC7123] discusses how some popular RA-Guard implementations are
   subject to evasion by means of IPv6 extension headers.

   While packets employing IPv6 Extension Headers have been "known" to
   be dropped in some IPv6 deployments, there was not much concrete data
   on the topic.  Some preliminary measurements have been presented in
   [PMTUD-Blackholes], [Gont-IEPG88] and [Gont-Chown-IEPG89], whereas

   [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90] presents more comprehensive results on which
   Section 4 of this document is based.

3.  Operational Implications

3.1.  Performance Issues

   Many IPv6 router implementations suffer from a negative performance
   impact when IPv6 Extension Headers are employed.

   In the most trivial case, a packet that includes a Hop-by-Hop Options
   header will typically go through the slow forwarding path, and be
   processed by the router's CPU.  Another case is that in which a
   router that has been configured to enforce an ACL based on upper-
   layer information (e.g., upper layer protocol or TCP Destination
   Port).  In such case, the router will need to process the entire IPv6
   header chain in order to find the required information, and this may
   cause the packet to be processed in the slow path [Cisco-EH-Cons].

   Processing a large amounts of traffic in the slow path may cause the
   router to be unable to handle the same traffic loads when compared to
   normal packets, and may result in Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios.

   We note that, for obvious reasons, the aforementioned performance
   issues may also affect other devices such as firewalls, Network
   Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), etc.  [Zack-FW-Benchmark].

3.2.  Security Implications

   The security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers generally fall
   into one or more of these categories:

   o  Evasion of security controls

   o  DoS due to processing requirements

   o  DoS due to implementation errors

   o  Extension Header-specific issues

   Different from IPv4, where the upper-layer protocol can be found
   after the variable-length IPv4 header, the structure of IPv6 packets
   is both more flexible and complex.  Namely, finding the upper-layer
   information may imply processing the (daisy-chain like) entire IPv6
   header chain.  This has been often overlooked, and a number of
   security devices have been found to be trivially evasible by
   inserting one or more IPv6 Extension Headers between the main IPv6
   header and the upper layer protocol.  [RFC7113] describes this issue



Gont, et al.             Expires March 14, 2015                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers           September 2014


   for the RA-Guard case, but the same techniques can be employed for
   circumventing e.g. some IPv6 firewalls.  Additionally,
   inconsistencies in how some packets may be processed may result in
   evasion of security controls [I-D.kampanakis-6man-ipv6-eh-parsing]
   [Atlasis2014].

   As noted in Section 3.1, packets that employ IPv6 Extension Headers
   may have a negative performance impact on the handling devices.
   Unless appropriate mitigations are put in place (e.g., packet
   filtering and/or rate-limiting), an attacker could simply send a
   large amount of IPv6 traffic employing IPv6 Extension Headers with
   the purpose of performing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

   IPv6 implementations, as virtually every piece of software, tend to
   mature over time.  While the IPv6 protocol itself (and many
   implementations) have been around for a long time already, bugs in
   IPv6 Extension Header processing have been recently found in a number
   of implementations.  Because there is currently almost no reliance on
   IPv6 Extension headers, the corresponding code paths are rarely
   exercised, and there is the potential that bugs still remain to be
   discovered in some implementations.

   Besides the general implications of IPv6 Extension Headers, each
   Extension Header tends to its own specific implications.  One
   particular case is that of the Fragment Header, which is employed to
   provide the fragmentation function in IPv6.  While many of the
   security implications of the fragmentation/reassembly mechanism are
   known from the IPv4 world, many of the related issues have creeped
   into IPv6 implementations.  They range from Denial of Service attacks
   to information leakage (see e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id], [Bonica-NANOG58],
   [Atlasis2012]).

4.  Support of IPv6 Extension Headers in the Public Internet

   This section summarizes the results obtained when measuring the
   support of IPv6 Extension Headers on the path towards different types
   of public IPv6 servers.  Two sources were employed for the list of
   public IPv6 servers: the "World IPv6 Launch Day" site
   (http://www.worldipv6launch.org/) and Alexa's top 1M web sites
   (http://www.alexa.com).  For each list of domain names, the following
   datasets were obtained:

   o  Web servers (AAAA records of the aforementioned list)

   o  Mail servers (MX -> AAAA of such list)

   o  Name servers (NS -> AAAA of such list)



Gont, et al.             Expires March 14, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers           September 2014


   Duplicate and unreachable addresses were eliminated from each of
   those lists prior to obtaining the results below.  Additionally,
   addresses that were found to be unreachable were discarded from the
   dataset (please see Appendix A for further details).

   For each of the aforementioned address sets, three different types of
   probes were performed:

   o  IPv6 packets with a Destination Options header of 8 bytes

   o  IPv6 packets resulting in two IPv6 fragments of 512 bytes each
      (approximately)

   o  IPv6 packets with a Hop-by-Hop Options header of 8 bytes

   In the case of packets with Destination Options Header and Hop-by-Hop
   Options header, the desired EH size was achieved by means of PadN
   options [RFC2460].  The upper-layer protocol of the probe packets
   was, in all cases, TCP [RFC0793] segments with the Destination Port
   set to the service port [IANA-PORT-NUMBERS] of the corresponding
   dataset.  For example, the probe packets for all the measurements
   involving web servers were TCP segments with the destination port set
   to 80.

   Besides obtaining the packet drop rate when employing the
   aforementioned IPv6 extension headers, we tried to identify whether
   the Autonomous System (AS) dropping the packets was the same as the
   Autonomous System of the destination/target address.  This is of
   particular interest since it essentially reveals whether the packet
   drops are under the control of the intended destination of the
   packets.  Packets dropped by the destination AS are less of a
   concern, since the device dropping the packets is under the control
   of the same organization as that to which the packets are destined
   (hence, it is probably easier to update the filtering policy if
   deemed necessary).  On the other hand, packets dropped by transit
   ASes are more of a concern, since they affect the deployability and
   usability of IPv6 extension headers (including IPv6 fragmentation) by
   a third-party (the destination AS).  In any case, we note that it is
   impossible to tell whether, in those cases where IPv6 packets with
   extension headers get dropped, the packet drops are the result of an
   explicit and intended policy, or the result of improper device
   configuration defaults, buggy devices, etc.  Thus, packet drops that
   occur at the destination AS might still prove to be problematic.

   Since there is some ambiguity when identifying the autonomous system
   to which a specific router belongs, our measurements result in a
   percentage *range* (see Appendix A.2).  In the following tables, the
   values shown within parentheses represent the estimated range of

   possibility that when a packet is dropped, the packet drop occurs in
   an AS other than the destination AS.

    were deemed to be dropped in a different AS (lower, in parentheses)

   There are a number of observations to be made based on the results
   presented above.  Firstly, while it has been generally assumed that
   it is IPv6 fragments that are dropped by operators, our results



Gont, et al.             Expires March 14, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers           September 2014


   indicate that it is IPv6 extension headers in general that are
   dropped.  Secondly, our results indicate that a significant
   percentage of such packet drops occur in transit Autonomous Systems;
   that is, the packet drops are not under the control of the same
   organization as the final destination.

5.  Implications of Widespread IPv6 Extension Header Filtering

   The results presented in Section 4 indicate that at least for part of
   the public Internet, communication employing IPv6 extension headers
   is unreliable.  The following subsections discuss specific
   implications arising from this conclusion.

5.1.  Advice to Protocol Designers

   New protocols that are to operate in the public Internet should
   consider the effect of widespread filtering of IPv6 extension headers
   in the public Internet.  If IPv6 extension headers are at all
   employed, a fall-back mechanism that does not rely on IPv6 extension
   headers should be considered.

5.2.  A possible attack vector

   The widespread filtering of IPv6 packets employing IPv6 Extension
   Headers can, in some scenarios, be exploited for malicious purposes:
   if packets employing IPv6 EHs are known to be filtered on the path
   from one system (say, "A") to another (say, "B"), an attacker could
   cause packets sent from A to B to be dropped by sending a forged
   ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) [RFC4443] error message to A (with a
   Next-Hop MTU smaller than 1280), such that subsequent packets from A
   to B include a fragment header (i.e., they result in atomic fragments
   [RFC6946]).

   Possible scenarios where this attack vector could be exploited
   include (but are not limited to):

   o  Communication between any two systems through to public network
      (e.g., client from/to server or server from/to server), where
      packets with IPv6 extension headers are filtered by some
      intermediate router

   o  Communication between two BGP peers employing IPv6 transport,
      where these BGP peers implement ACLs to drop IPv6 fragments (to
      avoid control-plane attacks)

   The aforementioned attack vector is exacerbated by the following
   factors:




Gont, et al.             Expires March 14, 2015                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers           September 2014


   o  The attacker does not need to forge the IPv6 Source Address of his
      attack packets.  Hence, deployment of simple BCP38 filters will
      not help as a counter-measure.

   o  Only the IPv6 addresses of the IPv6 packet embedded in the ICMPv6
      payload need to be forged.  While one could envision filtering
      devices enforcing BCP38-style filters on the ICMPv6 payload, the
      use of extension (by the attacker) could make this difficult, if
      at all possible.

   o  Many implementations fail to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages, as recommended in Section 5.2 of
      [RFC4443] and documented in [RFC5927].  It should be noted that in
      some cases, such as when an ICMPv6 error message has (supposedly)
      been elicited by a connection-less transport protocol (or some
      other connection-less protocol being encapsulated in IPv6), it may
      be virtually impossible to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages.  And, because of IPv6 extension
      headers, the ICMPv6 payload might not even contain any useful
      information on which to perform validation checks.

   o  Upon receipt of one of the aforementioned ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
      error messages, the Destination Cache [RFC4861] is usually updated
      to reflect that any subsequent packets to such destination should
      include a Fragment Header.  This means that a single ICMPv6
      "Packet Too Big" error message might affect multiple communication
      instances (e.g., TCP connections) with such destination.

   o  A node cannot simply "just filter/drop all incoming ICMPv6 Packet
      Too Big error messages", or else it would create a PMTUD
      blackhole.

   Possible mitigations for this issue include:

   o  Filtering incoming ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error messages that
      advertise a Next-Hop MTU smaller than 1280 bytes.

   o  Artificially reducing the MTU to 1280 bytes and filter incoming
      ICMPv6 PTB error messages.

   Both of these mitigations come at the expense of possibly preventing
   communication through SIIT [RFC6145] that rely on IPv6 atomic
   fragments (see [I-D.gont-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation]), and
   also implies that the filtering device has the ability to filter ICMP
   PTB messages based on the contents of the MTU field.

   [I-D.gont-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation] has recently proposed
   to deprecate the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments, and update the



Gont, et al.             Expires March 14, 2015                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers           September 2014


   SIIT [RFC6145] such that it does not rely on ICMPv6 atomic fragments.
   Thus, any of the above mitigations would eliminate the attack vector
   without any interoperability implications.

5.3.  Possible Future Work

   The impact of widespread filtering of IPv6 EHs on existing protocols
   should be considered.  In particular, the effect of widespread
   filtering of IPv6 fragments on the Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034]
   should be evaluated (particularly when it is expected that reliance
   on IPv6 transport will increase over time).

6.  Troubleshooting Packet Drops due to IPv6 Extension Headers

   Isolating IPv6 blackholes essentially involves performing IPv6
   traceroute for a destination system with and without IPv6 extension
   headers.  The (EH-free) traceroute would provide the full working
   path towards a destination, while the EH-enabled traceroute would
   provide the address of the last-responding node for EH-enabled
   packets (say, "M").  In principle, one could isolate the dropping
   node by looking-up "M" in the EH-free traceroute, with the dropping
   node being "M+1" (see Appendix A.1 for caveats).

   At the time of this writing, most traceroute implementations do not
   support IPv6 extension headers.  However, the path6 tool [path6] and
   RIPE Atlas [RIPE-Atlas] provide such support.  Additionally, the
   blackhole6 tool [blackhole6] automates the troubleshooting process
   and can readily provide information such as: dropping node's IPv6
   address, dropping node's Autonomous System, etc.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of IPv6 extension headers are discussed in
   Section 3.2.  A specific attack vector that would leverage the
   widespread filtering of packets with IPv6 EHs (along with possible
   countermeasures) is discussed in Section 5.2.  This document does not
   introduce any new security issues.

Appendix A.  Measurements Caveats

   A number of issues have needed some consideration when producing the
   results presented in Section 4.  These same issues should be
   considered when troubleshooting connectivity problems resulting from
   the use of IPv6 Extension headers.

A.1.  Isolating the Dropping Node

   Let us assume that we find that IPv6 packets with EHs are being
   dropped on their way to the destination system 2001:db8:d::1, and
   that the output of running traceroute towards such destination is:

      1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1
      2. 2001:db8:2:2000::4
      3. 2001:db8:2:4000::1
      4. 2001:db8:3:4000::1
      5. 2001:db8:3:1000::1
      6. 2001:db8:4:4000::1
      7. 2001:db8:4:1000::1
      8. 2001:db8:5:5000::1
      9. 2001:db8:5:6000::1
      10. 2001:db8:d::1

   Additionally, let us assume that the output of EH-enabled traceroute
   to the same destination is:




Gont, et al.             Expires March 14, 2015                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers           September 2014


      1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1
      2. 2001:db8:2:2000::4
      3. 2001:db8:2:4000::1
      4. 2001:db8:3:4000::1
      5. 2001:db8:3:1000::1
      6. 2001:db8:4:4000::1

   For the sake of brevity, let us refer to the last-responding node in
   the EH-enabled traceroute ("2001:db8:4:4000::1" in this case) as "M".
   Assuming both packets in both traceroutes employ the same path, we'll
   refer to "the node following the last responding node in the EH-
   enabled traceroute" ("2001:db8:4:1000::1" in our case), as "M+1",
   etc.

   Based on traceroute information above, which node is the one actually
   dropping the EH-enabled packets will depend on whether the dropping
   node filters packets on ingress or the egress.  If the former, the
   dropping node will be M+1.  If the latter, the dropping node will be
   "M".

   Throughout this document (and our measurements), we assume that nodes
   perform ingress-filtering.  Thus, in our example above the last
   responding node to the EH-enabled traceroute ("M") is
   "2001:db8:4:4000::1", and therefore we assume the "node" dropping
   node to be "2001:db8:4:1000::1" ("M+1").

   Additionally, we note that when isolating the dropping node we assume
   that both the EH-enabled and the EH-free traceroutes result in the
   same paths.  However, this might not be the case.

A.2.  Obtaining the Responsible Organization for the Packet Drops

   In order to identify the organization operating the dropping node,
   one would be tempted to lookup the ASN corresponding to the dropping
   node.  However, assuming that M and M+1 are two peering routers, any
   of these two organizations could be providing the address space
   employed for such peering.  Or, in the case of an Internet eXchange
   Point (IXP), the address space could correspond to the IXP AS, rather
   than to any of the participating ASes.  Thus, the organization
   operating the dropping node (M+1) could be the AS for M+1, but it
   might as well be the AS for M+2.  Only when the ASN for M+1 is the
   same as the ASN for M+2 we have certainty about who the responsible
   organization for the packet drops is (see slides 21-23 of
   [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90]).

   In the measurement results presented in Section 4, the aforementioned
   ambiguity results in "percentage ranges" (rather than a specific
   ratio): the lowest percentage value means that, when in doubt, we

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers           September 2014


   assume the packet drops occur in the same AS as the destination; on
   the other hand, the highest percentage value means that, when in
   doubt, we assume the packet drops occur at different AS than the
   destination AS.

   We note that the aforementioned ambiguity should also be considered
   when troubleshooting and reporting IPv6 packet drops, since
   identifying the organization responsible for the packet drops might
   probe to be a non-trivial task.

   Finally, we note that a specific organization might be operating more
   than one Autonomous System.  However, our measurements assume that
   different Autonomous System Numbers imply different organizations.
