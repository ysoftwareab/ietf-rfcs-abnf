Internet Draft     IPv6 Neighbour Discovery over ATM   August 28th, 1995


1. Introduction.

   This document deals with a number of issues associated with running
   IPv6 [1] over UNI3.1 [2] based ATM services. These may be
   characterised as:

      - Packet framing and multicasting.
      - Link Local address specification.
      - Neighbour Discovery source/target link-layer address option.
      - Interactions between ND and underlying IP/ATM architectures.

   Packet framing is dealt with in section 2, applying the newly
   assigned IPv6 Ethertype [3] to the encapsulation models developed for
   IPv4 unicast [4] and multicast [5]. Section 2 will also note the
   specific behaviour required of an IPv6-ATM interface when using the
   MARS protocol defined in [5] to support IPv6 multicast over UNI3.1
   ATM networks.

   Section 3 will describe the requirements for the structure of IPv6
   Link Local addresses [6], and suitable sources of link specific
   interface IDs.

   The format of the source and target link-layer address options in
   Neighbour Discovery [7] messages is described in section 4.

   Section 5 will open up the wider issues regarding the definition of
   ATM networks as being 'multicast' or 'shared media' links for the
   purposes of Neighbour Discovery, and how this impacts on the
   leveraging of current IPv4 work on 'cut through' routing models.

   [Editors note: Further discussion of the issues raised in this
   document is requested, as not all questions are currently answered
   satisfactorily.]


2. Framing unicast and multicast IPv6 packets.

   The Ethertype assigned to IPv6 is 0x86DD. Following the convention of
   RFC1483 for IPv4 unicast transmissions, the encapsulation for IPv6
   packet SHALL be:

      [0xAA-AA-03][0x00-00-00][0x86-DD][IPv6 packet]
          (LLC)       (OUI)     (PID)


   Multicasting is an integral part of IPv6. However, the service
   interface provided by UNI3.1 ATM networks do not support the concept
   of link-layer group addressing (which would have made the

   specification of IPv6 multicast over ATM trivial).  An additional
   convergence function is required between UNI3.1 ATM services and the
   IP layer to emulate a multicast-capable ATM link layer.

   The IP-ATM working group is nearing completion of such a convergence
   function, known as the 'MARS model' [5]. When using this approach the
   encapsulation for multicast IPv6 packets SHALL be:

      [0xAA-AA-03][0x00-00-5E][0x00-01][CMI][0x86-DD][IPv6 packet]
          (LLC)       (OUI)     (PID)

   (The 2 octet CMI - Cluster Member ID - field is defined in [5].)

   Additionally, when using the MARS for IPv6 multicast support:

      MARS message encapsulation remains the same:

         [0xAA-AA-03][0x00-00-00][0x08-06][MARS message]
             (LLC)       (OUI)     (PID)

      The ar$hrd field in MARS messages remains 0x13.

      The ar$pro field in MARS messages SHALL be 0x86DD.

      The ar$spln and ar$tpln fields (where relevant) are either 0 (for
      null or non-existent information) or 16 (for the full IPv6
      protocol address).


3. IPv6 Link-Local address.

   IPv6 nodes are required to generate a unique Link-Local IPv6 address
   for every link layer interface they have [6, 9].  Constructing these
   addresses requires an interface ID that is at least unique amongst
   all the interfaces attached to the same link. Routers are not allowed
   to forward packets with Link-Local destinations, so its is not
   strictly necessary for the interface ID to be unique across multiple
   independent links.

   The ATM environment complicates the sense of the word 'link'
   somewhat, in much the same way as it complicated the sense of
   'subnet' in the IPv4 case. For IPv4 this required the definition of
   the Logical IP Subnet - an administratively constrained set of hosts
   that would share the same routing prefixes (network and subnetwork
   masks).

   For want of a better term we might consider the IPv6 analog to be a
   Logical Link Group - LLG.



Armitage              Expires February 28th, 1996                [Page 3]

Internet Draft     IPv6 Neighbour Discovery over ATM   August 28th, 1995


      An LLG consists of nodes administratively configured to be IPv6
      neighbours.

   Sets of hosts that are members of the same MARS Cluster [5] SHOULD be
   considered to form an LLG.

   [Editors note - I'd be more than happy to be given some new text
   here, or even a pointer to a previously established IPv6 terminology
   that captures the sense of the LLG.]

   The width of the interface ID affects the width of routing prefixes
   that may then be applied to those portions of the IPv6 internet built
   over the given link technology. It is preferable to choose the
   smallest unique identifier possible.

   An interface to an LLG is itself logical, and is supported by a
   logical ATM interface. The ATM Forum allows three possible variations
   of ATM addresses. These are:

      - Native E.164 number.
      - 20 byte ATM Forum NSAP format number.
      - Native E.164 number with NSAP format subaddress.

   When NSAP format addresses are in use, logical ATM interfaces are
   constructed over physical ATM interfaces by using different SEL
   within the context of a given ESI, or even having multiple ESIs route
   to the same physical interface. When native E.164 addresses are in
   use, each logical ATM interface requires its own E.164 number.

   Therefore, the unique interface ID for the construction of Link-Local
   IPv6 addresses SHALL be 8 octets wide and be constructed in one of
   two ways:

      If the link interface has an NSAPA assigned, the 7 byte ESI+SEL
      value of the logical ATM interface being used by the IPv6 node is
      extracted and placed into the rightmost octets of the 8 octet
      interface ID. The leftmost octet is reserved and MUST be set to
      zero.

      If the link interface has only a native E.164 number assigned to
      it then a 7.5 octet BCD encoded version of the E.164 number is
      used to fill the 8 octet field. The semi-octet 0000 is used to
      begin the BCD stream, and the semi-octet value 1111 is used to pad
      out the field in cases where the E.164 number was less than the
      maximum 15 digits.

   The Link-Local IPv6 address thus appears as:

   |  bits    |       54 bits           |          64 bits           |

   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

   54 zero bits pad out the IPv6 address between the interface ID and
   the 10 bit Link-Local prefix.

   [Editors note: suggestions for a smaller interface ID are welcome.
   Based on the ' smallest width' criterion, and the association of LLGs
   and Clusters, the 16 bit Cluster Member ID (CMI) suggests itself.
   However, another valuable attribute of the interface ID is that it be
   long lasting. The CMI would potentially change everytime the node
   re-registered itself with the MARS - an event of unpredictable
   occurence.]


4. ND link-layer address options.

   Neighbour Discovery defines two options for carrying link-layer
   specific source and target addresses. In this case these options must
   carry full ATM addresses.

   The source and target link-layer address options must carry any one
   of the three possibilities, and indicate which one it is.

   The format for these two options when in an ATM environment SHALL be:

      [Type][Length][NTL][STL][..ATM Number..][..ATM Subaddress..]

      |   Fixed    ||            Link layer address              |

   [Type] is a one octet field.

      1 for Source link-layer address.  2 for Target link-layer address.

   [Length] is a one octet field.

      The total length of the option in multiples of 8 octets. Zeroed
      bytes are added to the end of the option to ensure its length is a
      multiple of 8 octets. (For example, a single ATM address in NSAPA
      format would result in 24 bytes of real data, require no padding,
      and result in [Length] being set to 3.)

   [NTL] is a one octet 'Number Type & Length' field.

      Defines the type and length of the ATM number immediately



Armitage              Expires February 28th, 1996                [Page 5]

Internet Draft     IPv6 Neighbour Discovery over ATM   August 28th, 1995


      following the [STL] field. The format is as follows:

                 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                |0|x|  length   |
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      The most significant bit is reserved and MUST be set to zero.  The
      second most significant bit (x) is a flag indicating whether the
      ATM number is in:

         ATM Forum NSAPA format (x = 0).
         Native E.164 format (x = 1).

      The bottom 6 bits is an unsigned integer value indicating the
      length of the associated ATM address in octets.

   The [STL] is a one octet 'Subaddress Type & Length' field.

      Format is the same as the [NTL] field. Defines the length of the
      subaddress field, if it exists. If it does not exist this entire
      octet field MUST be zero. If the subaddress exists it will be in
      NSAPA format, so flag x SHALL be zero.

   [ATM Number] is a variable length field. It is always present.

   [ATM Subaddress] is a variable length field. It may or may not be
   present. When it is not, the option ends after the [ATM Number] (or
   any additional padding for 8 byte alignment).


5. The wider implications of Neighbour Discovery.

   The assumptions behind Neighbour Discovery interact in interesting
   ways with two broad areas of IP over ATM work - multicast support and
   'cut through' unicast routing.

   In its most general form Neighbour Discovery (and IPv6 in general)
   relies on the underlying IPv6/link-layer interface to support
   multicasting.

   Multicast needs to be emulated in UNI3.1 environments.  The 'on-
   link/off-link' distinction for neighbours lends itself to a Classical
   IP model of IPv6 over ATM, where nodes are grouped into Logical Link
   Groups (LLGs). However, as for IPv4, such administrative boundaries
   need to be 'cut through' to provide maximal use of the underlying ATM
   service.

5.1 Using MARS multicast support.

5.1.1 Initialisation.

   The 'black box' approach to IPv6 over ATM is to just use a MARS based
   IP/ATM interface in a straightforward manner.

   When a host starts up it SHALL issue a single group MARS_JOIN for the
   following groups:

      - Its derived Solicited-node address(es) with link-local scope.
      - The All-nodes address with link-local scope.
      - Other multicast groups with at least link-local scope.

   For example the IPv6 node with address 4037::01:800:200E:8C6C would
   issue the following MARS_JOIN to register as a member of its
   Solicited-Node multicast group:

      MARS_JOIN(FF02::1:200E:8C6C, FF02::1:200E:8C6C)

   Joining or leaving a multicast group with node-local scope (scope 1)
   MUST NOT cause MARS_JOIN or MARS_LEAVE messages to be transmitted.
   (The smallest scope managed by a MARS is scope 2 (link-local), and so
   this is the smallest scope that MARS message are issued for.)

   IPv6 routers may be considered to be built of two parts - a
   forwarding engine, and an endpoint. The forwarding engine needs to be
   listening promiscuously across all multicast groups that need
   forwarding outside the link scope. The endpoint within a router needs
   to listen only on specific groups that have scope of link-local or
   larger.

   To support the forwarding engine:

      - IPv6 routers SHALL perform a block MARS_JOIN for the range(s) of
        IPv6 multicast addresses they require each ATM interface to
        listen on (as described in section 9 of [5]).
      - They MUST NOT issue a block join for multicast addresses with
        scope of 1 (node-local) or 2 (link-local).

   To support their internal endpoints, IPv6 routers SHALL perform a
   single group MARS_JOIN for the following groups:

      - Its derived Solicited-node address(es).
      - The All-nodes address with link-local scope.
      - The All-routers address with link-local scope.
      - Other multicast groups to which the endpoint within the router
        belongs with at least link-local scope.

5.1.2 Simple discovery.

   When a Neighbour Solicitation needs to be multicast, the ND entity
   simply passes down the ICMPv6 packet for transmission. The MARS based
   IP/ATM driver would query the MARS for the destination Solicited-node
   multicast address and establish the outgoing VC as per [5].  Having
   received the solicitation, the appropriate target node unicasts their
   Neighbour Advertisement back (using the source link-layer address
   carried along with the solicitation) and the process is complete.

   This will certainly work. However, it does raise some questions about
   whether this is the most effective use of the available resources.

5.1.3 Optimising discovery.

   The MARS already knows what link-layer address(es) are associated
   with every Solicited-node IPv6 multicast group address registered in
   your Logical Link Group (LLG, or Cluster).  Assume that your LLG is
   such that each node's addresses map to a unique Solicited-node
   multicast group. In this case the MARS will have only one ATM address
   associated with every mapping. We thus know that the Neighbour
   Solicitation sent using the 'black box' approach described above will
   reach only one node.

   If the ATM address registered as the mapping in the MARS is the same
   as the one that the node would return in its Neighbour Advertisement,
   we might consider the optimisation of skipping the actual VC setup
   and NS/NA exchange. The ATM address returned in the MARS_MULTI could
   be copied into a locally generated Neighbour Advertisement and passed
   back up to the local ND entity.

   A number of assumptions exist in the preceding idea. The most
   important one is that no MCS has been configured to support that
   particular group (otherwise the MARS would return the ATM address of
   the MCS rather than the target node).

   The second assumption is that only one node maps to each Solicited-
   node multicast group. If this is not true then the 'black box'
   approach to will need to be followed, letting the multiple recipients
   of the Neighbour Solicitation decide whether to respond. This
   assumption will be true if the interface IDs of all the nodes in your
   LLG are unique in their bottom 32 bits. However, this may not always
   be the case.

   Finally, we assumed that the ATM address registered with the MARS was
   the one that the node would have wanted to return to a Neighbour
   Solicitation.  This may not necessarily be the case, as Neighbour
   Discovery allows nodes to associate multiple link-layer interfaces



Armitage              Expires February 28th, 1996                [Page 8]

Internet Draft     IPv6 Neighbour Discovery over ATM   August 28th, 1995


   with a single IPv6 address (and hence a single Solicited-node
   multicast group). The intention is that the node itself can load-
   share unicast traffic amongst these link-layer interfaces by
   responding differently each time it receives a Neighbour
   Solicitation.

   Further research needs to be done on the validity of these
   assumptions, and whether they allow us to introduce some
   optimisations to the basic Neighbour Discovery mechanism when running
   over a MARS based IP/ATM interface.

5.2 Neighbour Discovery and 'cut through' routing.

   IPv6 contains a concept of on-link and off-link. Neighbours are those
   nodes that are considered on-link and whose link-layer addresses may
   therefore be located using Neighbour Discovery.  Borrowing from the
   terminology definitions in the ND text:

   on-link   - an address that is assigned to a neighbor's interface on
               a shared link.  A host considers an address to be on-link
               if:
                 - it is covered by one of the link's prefixes, or
                 - a neighboring router specifies the address as the
                   target of a Redirect message, or
                 - a Neighbor Advertisement message is received for the
                   target address, or
                 - a Router Advertisement message is received from the
                   address.

   off-link  - the opposite of "on-link"; an address that is not
               assigned to any interfaces attached to a shared link.

   Off-link nodes are considered to only be accessible through one of
   the routers directly attached to the link.

   (Using the terminology of section 3, in the ATM environment a 'link'
   is an LLG.)

   It is not clear at this stage how mechanisms such as 'cut through'
   routing are best integrated with Neighbour Discovery.  In the IPv6
   case cut through routing explicitly allows a node to treat off-link
   nodes as neighbours. This could lead an IPv6 node to have 3
   categories of outbound paths:

      - on-link, directly accessible at link-layer.
      - pseudo on-link, directly accessible at link-layer, technically
        off-link.
      - off-link, access is through an on-link router.

Internet Draft     IPv6 Neighbour Discovery over ATM   August 28th, 1995


   A key issue to be addressed is how an IPv6 node learns the link-layer
   address of an ostensibly off-link target.  Related on-going work in
   the IPv4 area is the ROLC working group's Next Hop Resolution
   Protocol, NHRP [8]. How this work may be applied to ND is still to be
   defined.

   One possible application of NHRP style technology would be similar to
   the optimisation mentioned in section 5.1 when using the MARS. The
   IPv6/ATM interface driver could trap outgoing Neighbour
   Solicitations, convert them into NHRP requests, and the use NHRP
   replies to generate 'fake' Neighbour Advertisements.

   The following questions then need to be addressed:

    - How NHSs learn of the existence of nodes,
    - How we maintain the ability of a target node to return different
      link-layer addresses per Neighbour Solicitation for load
      balancing,
    - How the sending node adjusts its Neighbour Cache, Destination
      Cache, Prefix List, and Default Router List.

   [Editors note: "..still to be defined" is my code phrase meaning "I'd
   love to have some suggested text to go here 'cos I cant think of any
   really good stuff myself". Contributions welcome.]
