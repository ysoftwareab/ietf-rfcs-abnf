                   Representing DNS Messages in JSON
                    draft-hoffman-dns-in-json-00

Abstract

   Some applications use DNS messages, or parts of DNS messages, as
   data.  For example, a system that captures DNS queries and responses
   might want to be able to easily search those without having to decode
   the messages each time.  Another example is a system that puts
   together DNS queries and responses from message parts.  This document
   fully describes a standardized format for DNS message data in JSON.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS message format is defined in [RFC1035].  DNS queries and DNS
   responses have exactly the same structure.  Many of the field names
   and data type names given in RFC 1035 are commonly used in
   discussions of DNS.  For example, it is common to hear things like
   "the query had a QNAME of 'example.com'" or "the RDATA has a simple
   structure".

   There are hundreds of data interchange formats for serializing
   structured data.  Currently, JSON [RFC7159] is quite popular for many
   types of data, particularly data that has named sub-fields and
   optional parts.

   This document uses JSON to describe DNS messages.  It also defines
   how to describe a stream of DNS queries or a stream of DNS responses,
   and how to describe a paired DNS query and response; these are useful
   for logging on a DNS server.

1.1.  Design of the Format

   There are many ways to design a data format.  This document uses a
   specific design methodology based on the DNS format.

   o  The format is based on JSON objects in order to allow a writer to
      include or exclude parts of the format at will.  No object members
      are ever required.

   o  All values that are eight bits or shorter (even booleans) are
      represented by JSON integers.

   o  Many values that can have non-ASCII data in them have names that
      end in "*" and are stored in base16 encoding (hex with uppercase
      letters) defined in [RFC4648].

   o  Some values will be very long and implementations might care about
      the size of the records on the wire.  Values that are expected to
      be long (the entire record, some resource records such as those
      with cryptographic keys, and so on) have names that end in "!" and
      are stored in base64url encoding defined in [RFC4648].

   o  All names used in RFC 1035 are used in this format as-is.  Names
      not defined in RFC 1035 use "camel case" with the first letter
      lowercase.

   o  Because domain names that follow the host name rules are so
      common, there are additional members for domain names that are
      also host names and can be shown as unencoded strings.  See
      [RFC1123] for the host name rules.

   o  The same data may be represented in multiple object members
      multiple times.  For example, there is a member for the octets of
      the DNS message header, and there are members for each named part
      of the header.  A message object can thus inadvertently have
      inconsistent data, such as a header member whose value does not
      match the value of the first bits in the entire message member.

   o  The design explicitly allows for the description of malformed DNS
      messages.  This is important for systems that are logging messages
      seen on the wire, particularly messages that might be used as part
      of an attack.  For example, an RR might have an RDLENGTH of 4 but
      an RDATA whose length is longer than 4 (if it is the last RR in a
      message); a DNS message whose QDCOUNT is 0; a DNS message whose
      length is less than 12 octets, meaning it doesn't even have a full
      header; and so on.

2.  JSON Format for DNS Messages

   The following gives all of the members defined for a DNS message.  It
   is organized approximately by levels of the DNS message.

   Note that an object in this format can have zero or more of the
   members defined here; that is, no members are required.  Also, an
   object can have members that are not defined in this document.

2.1.  Message Object Members

   o  ID - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  QR - Integer whose value is 0 or 1

   o  Opcode - Integer whose value is 0 to 15

   o  AA - Integer whose value is 0 or 1

   o  TC - Integer whose value is 0 or 1

   o  RD - Integer whose value is 0 or 1

   o  RA - Integer whose value is 0 or 1

   o  AD - Integer whose value is 0 or 1

   o  CD - Integer whose value is 0 or 1

   o  RCODE - Integer whose value is 0 to 15

   o  QDCOUNT - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  ANCOUNT - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  NSCOUNT - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  ARCOUNT - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  QNAME* - The octets of the QNAME of the first Question section of
      the message

   o  hostQNAME - The host name of the domain name in the QNAME, or an
      empty string if the QNAME is not a host name

   o  QTYPE - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535, of the QTYPE of the
      first Question section of the message

Internet-Draft                 DNS in JSON                   August 2014


   o  QCLASS - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535, of the QCLASS of the
      first Question section of the message

   o  questionRRs - Array of zero or more resource records in the
      Question section

   o  answerRRs - Array of zero or more resource records in the Answer
      section

   o  authorityRRs - Array of zero or more resource records in the
      Authority section

   o  additionalRRs - Array of zero or more resource records in the
      Additional section

2.2.  Resource Record Object Members

   A resource record is represented as an object with the following
   members.

   o  NAME* - The octets of the NAME field of the resource record

   o  hostNAME - The host name of the domain name in the NAME, or an
      empty string if the NAME is not a host name

   o  expandedNAME* - The octets of the NAME field after RFC 1035
      removing name compression

   o  TYPE - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  CLASS - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  TTL - Integer whose value is 0 to 4294967295

   o  RDLENGTH - Integer whose value is 0 to 65535

   o  RDATA* - The octets of the RDATA field of the resource record

   o  RDATA! - The octets of the RDATA field of the resource record

   The values of the NAME* and hostNAME and expandedNAME* members might
   all be the same, or could be different.

   A Question section can be expressed as a resource record.  When doing
   so, the TTL, RDLENGTH, and RDATA* members make no sense.

2.3.  The Message and Its Parts as Octets

   The following can be members of a message object.

   o  messageOctets* - The octets of the message

   o  messageOctets! - The octets of the message

   o  headerOctets* - The first 12 octets of the message (or fewer, if
      the message is truncated)

   o  questionOctets* - The octets of the Question section

   o  answerOctets* - The octets of the Answer section

   o  answerOctets! - The octets of the Answer section

   o  authorityOctets* - The octets of the Authority section

   o  additionalOctets* - The octets of the Additional section

   The following can be a member of a resource record object.

   o  rrOctets* - The octets of a particular resource record

   o  rrOctets! - The octets of a particular resource record

2.4.  Additional Message Object Members

   The following are members that might appear in a message object:

   o  dateString - The date that the message was sent or received, given
      as a string in the standard format described in [RFC3339], as
      refined by Section 3.3 of [RFC4287]

   o  dateSeconds - The date that the message was sent or received,
      given as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00Z in UTC
      time; this number can be fractional

   o  comment - An unstructured comment as a string.

3.  JSON Format for Streams of DNS Messages

   A strem of DNS messages is represented as an array of zero or more
   message objects.

Internet-Draft                 DNS in JSON                   August 2014


4.  JSON Format for a Paired DNS Query and Response

   A paired DNS query and response is represented as an object.  Two
   optional members of this object are names "queryRecord" and
   "responseRecord", and each has a value that is an message object.
   This design was chosen (as compared to the more obvious array of two
   values) so that a paired DNS query and response could be
   differentiated from a stream of DNS messages whose length happens to
   be two.

5.  Examples

5.1.  Example of the Format of a DNS Query

   The following is an example of a query for the A record of
   example.com.

   { "ID": 19678, "QR": 0, "Opcode": 0,
     "AA": 0, "TC": 0, "RD": 0, "RA": 0, "AD": 0, "CD": 0, "RCODE": 0,
     "QDCOUNT": 1, "ANCOUNT": 0, "NSCOUNT": 0, "ARCOUNT": 0,
     "QNAME*": "076578616D706C6503636F6D00", "QTYPE": 1, "QCLASS": 1
   }

   As stated earlier, all members of an object are optional.  This
   example object could have one or more of the following members as
   well:

   "answerRRs": []
   "authorityOctets*": ""
   "comment": "Something pity goes here"
   "dateSeconds": 1408504748.657783
   "headerOctets*": "4CDE00000001000000000000"
   "hostQNAME": "example.com"
   "messageOctets*":
        "4CDE00000001000000000000076578616D706C6503636F6D0000010001"
   "messageOctets!": "TN4AAAABAAAAAAAAB2V4YW1wbGUDY29tAAABAAE="
   "questionOctets*": "076578616D706C6503636F6D0000010001"
   "questionRRs": [ { "NAME*": "076578616D706C6503636F6D00", "TYPE": 1,
                      "CLASS": 1, "hostNAME" : "example.com" } ]

5.2.  Example of the Format of a Paired DNS Query and Response

   The following is a paired DNS query and response for a query for the
   A record of example.com.

                     "TYPE": 1, "CLASS": 1, "TTL": 3600, "RDLENGTH": 4,
                     "RDATA*": "16212C37" } ],
       "authorityRRs": [ { "NAME*": "026E73076578616D706C6503636F6D00",

                           "RDLENGTH": 4, "RDATA*": "A5E3F903",
                           "hostNAME": "ns.example.com" } ] }
   }

6.  Local Format Policy

   Systems using this format in this document will likely have policy
   about what must be in the objects.  Those policies are outside the
   scope of this document.

   For example, private DNS systems such as those described in
   [I-D.dulaunoy-kaplan-passive-dns-cof] covers just DNS responses.
   Such a system might have a policy that makes QNAME*, QTYPE, and
   answerRRs mandatory.  That document also describes two mandatory
   times that are not in this format, so the policy would possibly also
   define those members and make them mandatory.  The policy could also
   define additional members that might appear in a record.

   As another example, a program that uses this format for configuring
   what a test client sends on the wire might have a policy of "each
   record object can have as few members as it wants; all unstated
   members are filled in from previous records".

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no effect on IANA registries.

8.  Security Considerations

   As described in Section 1.1, a message object can have inconsistent
   data, such as a message with an ANCOUNT of 1 but that has either an
   empty answerRRs array or an answerRRs array that has 2 or more RRs.
   Other examples of inconsistent data would be resource records whose

   RDLENGTH does not match the length of the decoded value in the RDATA*
   member, or a record whose various header fields do not match the
   value in headerOctets*, and so on.  A reader of this format must
   never assume that all of the data in an object are all consistent
   with each other.

   Numbers in JSON do not have any bounds checking.  Thus, integer
   values in a record might have invalid values, such as an ID value
   that is negative, or greater than or equal to 2^16, or has a
   fractional part.
