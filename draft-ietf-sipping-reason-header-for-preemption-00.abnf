cause=1 is as follows:

      A user agent in a session has purposely preempted a session and 
      is informing the far end user agent, or user agents (if part of a
      conference), and SIP Proxies (if stateful of the session's 
      transactions)

cause=2 is as follows:

      A router has preempted a reservation flow and generated a ResvErr
      (downstream).  The (downstream) UA receiving the ResvErr message 
      generates a BYE request towards the far side UA with a Reason 
      Header with this value indicating that somewhere in between two 
      or more UAs, a layer 3/4 device (router) has administratively 
      preempted this session
