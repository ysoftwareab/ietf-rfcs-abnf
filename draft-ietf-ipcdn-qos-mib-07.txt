INTERNET-DRAFT<draft-ietf-ipcdn-qos-mib-07.txt>February 2003



1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMP SMIv2[1][2][3].  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

   This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be
   addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@ietf.org
   and/or the author.


1.1  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [12].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [3].

1.2  Glossary



   Active QPS     Active Qos Parameter Set.  The set of QOS parameters
                  that describe the current level service provided to a
                  Service Flow.

   Active SF      Active Service Flow. An SF with a non-empty Active
                  QPS.

   Admitted QPS   Admitted Qos Parameter Set. The set of QOS parameters
                  that describe a level of service which the Service
                  Flow is not currently using, but which it is
                  guaranteed to receive upon the SF's request to make
                  the set Active.

   Admitted SF    A Service Flow with a non-empty Admitted QPS.

   CATV           Cable TV

   CM             Cable Modem, a modem connecting a subscriber's LAN the
                  CATF RF network. DOCSIS CMs operate as a MAC layer
                  bridge between the home LAN and the RF network.

INTERNET-DRAFT<draft-ietf-ipcdn-qos-mib-07.txt>February 2003



   CMTS           Cable Modem Termination System, the "head-end" device
                  providing connectivity between the RF network and the
                  Internet.

   Downstream     The direction from the head end towards the
                  subscriber.

   DSA            Dynamic Service Addition, a DOCSIS MAC management
                  message requesting the dynamic creation of a new
                  Service Flow.  New SFs are created with a three-
                  message exchange of a DSA-REQ, DSA-RSP, and DSA-ACK.

   DSC            Dynamic Service Change, a DOCSIS MAC management
                  message requesting a change to the attributes of a
                  Service Flow.  SFs are changed with a three-message
                  exchange of a DSC-REQ, DSC-RSP, and DSC-ACK.

   DSD            Dynamic Service Delete, a DOCSIS MAC management
                  message requesting the deletion of a Service Flow. SFs
                  are deleted with a two-message exchange of a DSD-REQ
                  and DSD-ACK.

   Head-end       The origination point in most cable systems of the
                  subsriber video signals. It is generally also the
                  location of the CMTS.

   PHS            Payload Header Suppression, a feature of DOCSIS 1.1 in
                  which header bytes that are common in a sequence of
                  packets of a Service Flow are replaced by a one-byte
                  PHSI Index (PHSI) when transmitting the packet on the
                  RF network.

   Provisioned QPS A QOS Parameter Set describing an envelope of service
                  within which a Service Flow is authorized to request
                  admission.  All existing service flows must have a
                  non-empty Provisioned QPS, hence all SFs are

   SCN            Service Class Name -- a named set of QOS parameters.
                  A Service Flow may or may not be associated with a
                  single named Service Class.  A Service Class has as an
                  attribute a Qos Parameter Set that is used as the
                  default set of values for all Service Flows belonging
                  to the Service Class.

2.  Overview

   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of
   DOCSIS 1.1 compliant Cable Modems (CM) and Cable Modem Termination
   Systems (CMTS).  The specification is derived from the DOCSIS 1.1
   Radio Frequency Interface specification [4].   Please note that the
   referenced DOCSIS standard only requires Cable Modems to process IPv4
   customer traffic. Design choices in this MIB reflect those
   requirements.  Future versions of the DOCSIS standard are expected to
   require support for IPv6 as well.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [7].


2.1  Textual Conventions

   The textual convention "IfDirection" is defined to indicate the
   direction of a packet classifier relative to an interface. It takes
   the values of either downstream(1) or upstream(2).

   The textual convention "BitRate" corresponds to the bits per second
   as defined for QOS Parameter Sets in DOCSIS1.1. This definition
   includes all bits of the Ethernet MAC frame as transmitted on the RF
   network, starting with the Destination Address and ending with the
   Ethernet FCS. It does NOT includes bits in the DOCSIS MAC header.





2.2  MIB Organization


   The structure of the MIB is summarized below:

   The MIB is organized as 11 tables. Most tables are implemented in
   both the CM and CMTS; the docsQosUpstreamStatsTable and
   docsQosServiceFlowLogTable are implemented on the CMTS only.


2.2.1  docsQosPktClassTable

   The docsQosPktClassTable reports the Service Flow Classifiers
   implemented by the managed device. The table is indexed by the tuple
   { ifIndex, docsQosServiceFlowId, docsQosPktClassId }.  The ifIndex
   corresponds to an CATV MAC interface.  Each CATV MAC interfaces has a
   set of Service Flows, identified with a docsQosServiceFlowId value
   that is unique for that interface. Each service flow may have a
   number of packet classifiers that map packets to the flow. The
   ClassifierId for the classifier is unique only within a particular
   service flow.

   The semantics of packet classification are provided in [4]. Briefly,
   the DOCSIS MAC interface calls for matching packets based on values
   within the 802.2 (LLC), 802.3, IP, and/or  UDP/TCP headers.  Packets
   which map more than one classifier are prioritized according to their
   docsQosPktClassPriority value. The docsQosServiceFlowId (an index
   object) indicates to which service flow the packet is classified.

   The docsQosPktClassTable is distinct from the docsDevIpFilterTable of
   [9] in that docsQosPktClassTable is intended only to reflect the
   state of the Service Flow Classifiers. Service Flow Classifiers may
   be created only via a CM configuration file or from the Dynamic
   Service Addition (DSA) messages.  For this reason,
   docsQosPktClassTable is read-only.

   The docsDevIpFilterTable is intended for external policy-based
   administration of packet classifiers.  See the section "Externally
   Administered Classification", below.


2.2.2  docsQosParamSetTable

   The docsQosParamSetTable reports the values of Qos Parameter Set as
   defined in Section C.2.2 of [4].

   In general, a Service Flow is associated with three different Qos

   Parameter Sets (QPSs): an "active" QPS, an "admitted" QPS, and a
   "provisioned" or "authorized" QPS.  The relationship of these three
   sets is represented below:





                         +---------------------+
                         | Provisioned         |
                         |                     |
                         |  +---------------+  |
                         |  |  Admitted     |  |
                         |  |               |  |
                         |  |  +---------+  |  |
                         |  |  |  Active |  |  |
                         |  |  |         |  |  |
                         |  |  +---------+  |  |
                         |  |               |  |
                         |  +---------------+  |
                         |                     |
                         +---------------------+

                       Figure 1: Qos Parameter Sets



   The Provisioned QPS describes the maximum service envelope for which
   the SF is authorized. The Admitted QPS is the set of services for
   which a service flow has requested admission to the DOCSIS RF
   network, but which is not yet active. The Admitted QPS is used during
   the two-phase process of IP Telephony service flow admission to admit
   the bandwidth for a bidirectional voice call when the far end is
   ringing.  Since ringing may occur for up to four minutes, this
   permits the bandwidth to be reserved but not actually consumed during
   this interval.  The Active QPS is the set of services actually being
   used by the Service Flow. The DOCSIS v1.1 specification [4] defines
   what it means for a QPS envelope to be "within" another.  In general,
   an inner QPS is considered to be "within" an outer QPS when all QOS
   parameters represent demands of equal or fewer resources of the
   network.

   In addition to their use as attributes of a Service Flow, a QPS is
   also an attribute of a Service Class.  A DOCSIS CM configuration file
   or DSA message may request the creation of a new SF and give only the
   Service Class Name. The CMTS "expands the macro" of a Service Class
   Name creation by populating the Provisioned, Admitted, and/or Active
   QPSs of the Service Flow with the QPS of the Service Class Name. All
   of the QPSs of a Service Flow must be expansions of the same Service
   Class, and in this case the SF is said to "belong" to the Service
   Class.  Changing the contents of a Service Class' QPS does not affect

   the QPS of any Service Flow earlier expanded from that Service Class
   name. Only the CMTS implements docsQosServiceClassTable.

   See [4] section 8 for a full description and the theory of operation
   of Docsis 1.1 QOS operation.



   The docsQosParamSetTable sets are indexed by { ifIndex,
   docsQosServiceFlowId, docsQosParamSetType}. ifIndex indicates a
   particular "DOCSIS MAC Domain". docsQosServiceFlowId uniquely
   identifies a service flow on that MAC domain.  The
   docsQosParamSetType indicates whether the row describes an active,
   admitted, or provisioned Qos Parameter Set.

   The docsQosParamSetTable is read-only, because it indicates the Qos
   Parameter Set contents as defined by DOCSIS signaling. The
   docsQosServiceClassTable is read-create to permit managers to define
   a template of Qos Parameters that can be referenced by DOCSIS modems
   when creating their Qos Parameter Sets.


2.2.2.1  Interoperation with DOCSIS 1.0

   The DOCSIS 1.0 DOCS-IF-MIB [10] specifies a docsIfQosProfileTable to
   describe the set of Class Of Service (COS) parameters associated with
   a COS "profile". The docsIfCmServiceTable, which contains one entry
   per SID, references this table with a  docsIfCmServiceQosProfile
   number.

   The DOCSIS 1.1 CM registration process allows a modem to register as
   operating either with DOCSIS 1.0 or DOCSIS 1.1 functionality.  For
   ease of expression, we call a modem registering with DOCSIS 1.0
   functionality a "DOCSIS 1.0 modem", regardless of the modem's
   capabilities.

   A CMTS or CM supporting both DOCSIS 1.0 and DOCSIS 1.1 implements
   both the tables of [10] and the tables of this MIB.  The
   interoperation goal is that before modem registration, the DOCSIS 1.0
   MIB [10] applies.  After registration, either the DOCSIS 1.0 or
   DOCSIS 1.1 MIB applies, depending on the mode with which the modem
   registered.  The specific interoperation rules are:


     1.  When a CM initially ranges, the CM implements a row in the
         DOCS-IF-MIB docsIfCmServiceTable and the CMTS implements a row
         in the DOCS-IF-MIB docsIfCmtsServiceTable corresponding to the
         default upstream Service ID  (SID) used for  pre-registration
         upstream traffic. For historical compatibility a row may be
         created for the docsIfQosProfileTable with default values,
         which may be referenced by the docsIfCmServiceTable entries.

INTERNET-DRAFT<draft-ietf-ipcdn-qos-mib-07.txt>February 2003



     2.  Both a CMTS and CM implementing this MIB MUST NOT implement
         docsQosParamSetTable or docsQosServiceFlowTable rows until
         after the CM registers with DOCSIS 1.1 modem operation.


     3.  When a modem registers with the CMTS as a "DOCSIS 1.1" modem,
         any exclusively-referenced  row in DOCS-IF-MIB
         docsQosProfileTable representing the modems upstream Qos
         profile for pre-registration traffic MUST be removed.
         Multiply-referenced rows may remain.  The
         docsQosIfCmServiceQosProfile object in the CM's row of
         docsIfCmServiceTable MUST be set to zero.  The
         docsIfCmServiceTable row for the DOCSIS 1.1 modem continues to
         exist, and the various statistic objects in that row are
         incremented. The CMTS should retain the docsIfCmtsServiceTable
         entry for the DOCSIS 1.1 CM.


     4.  When a DOCSIS 1.1 modem registers, both the CMTS and CM
         represent all service flows described in the modem
         configuration file in docsQosParamSetTable and
         docsQosServiceFlowTable.


     5.  At the CMTS, the Docsis 1.0 MIB objects
         docsIfCmtsServiceInPackets and docsIfCmtsServiceInOctets for a
         SID assigned to a Docsis 1.1 modem count only the pre-
         registration packets/bytes of those modems.


     6.  DOCSIS 1.0 modems do not have entries in the DOCS-QOS-MIB.



2.2.3  docsQosServiceFlowTable

   The docsQosServiceFlowTable provides read-only information about all
   of the service flows known by the device. It is indexed by the
   combination of { ifIndex, dosQosServiceFlowId }, where ifIndex
   corresponds to a CATV MAC interface and docsQosServiceFlowId is the
   32- bit integer assigned by the CMTS controlling the MAC domain.  A
   CM typically has only a single CATV MAC interface, while a CMTS may
   have several. See  [10] for a description of the ifIndex numbering
   for DOCSIS devices.

   The table indicates whether a given SF is in the upstream or
   downstream direction, and whether it is the "primary" SF in that
   direction.  The primary SF carries traffic that is not otherwise
   classified to any other SF in that direction.

2.2.4  docsQosServiceFlowStatsTable

   The docsQosServiceFlowStatsTable provides statistics for all
   currently existing SFs known by the managed device.  It provides
   basic packet and octet counters, as well as certain other SF-specific
   stats such as the time at which the flow was created and how many
   seconds it has been active.

   The table also provides objects which can be used to fine-tune
   admission control decisions, namely the number of packets dropped or
   delayed due to QOS policing decisions enforced by the managed device.

   The model of the service flows stats table is that there exists a
   service flow Classification function followed by a service flow
   maximum rate Policing function for packets transmitted onto the
   Docsis RF network, as depicted below

   Packets intended for transmission onto the Docsis RF network
   (upstream or downstream) are first classified to a service flow by
   matching one of several possible classifiers associated with that
   service flow.  The docsQosPktClassPkts count includes the number of
   packets that match the classifier, regardless of the eventual
   disposition of the packet.

   DOCSIS requires that each service flow be policed to maintain a
   maximum rate of transmission. This is performed by either dropping or
   delaying a packet on that service flow.  The
   docsQosServiceFlowPolicedDropPkts object counts the number of service
   flow packets dropped by the policing function.  The
   docsQosServiceFlowPolicedDelayPkts counts the number of packet
   delayed but still forwarded.  The docsQosServiceFlowPkts object
   counts the total number of packets forwarded beyond the policing
   function intended for eventual transmission onto the DOCSIS RF
   network. Although packets may be latter dropped by other functions
   (e.g. a transmit queue overflow on a DOCSIS hardware transmitter),
   the docsQos MIB per service-flow counters are not affected in this
   case.

2.2.5  docsQosUpstreamStatsTable

   This table provides statistics that are measured only at the CMTS in
   the upstream direction. These include a count of the number of
   fragmentation headers received, fragments discarded, and the number
   of concatenation headers received.


2.2.6  docsQosDynamicServiceStatsTable

   This table provides read-only stats on the operation of the Dynamic
   Service state machines as specified in section 9.4 of [4]. It
   provides a set of 14 counters *in each direction* for a Docsis MAC
   layer interface. That is, each Docsis MAC layer interface has one row
   for downstream stats, and a second row for upstream stats.

   Eight of the counters are DSx packet type counts, one counter for
   each of the eight DSx packet types. For example, the docsQosDSAReqs
   object in the upstream row at the CMTS counts the number of DSA-REQ
   messages received by the CMTS from that interface.  The
   docsQosDSAReqs object in the downstream row at the CMTS counts the
   number of DSA-REQ messages transmitted by the CMTS on that interface.

   The remaining six counters per (interface, direction) combination
   count the number of successful and unsuccessful *transactions* that
   were initiated on the interface and direction. For example, the
   upstream docsQosDynamicAdds on a CMTS is the number of successfully
   completed CM-initiated dynamic additions, because at the CMTS a CM-
   initiated DSA starts in the upstream direction.  The downstream
   docsQosDynamicAdds at a CMTS is the number of successful CMTS-
   initiated DSA transactions.

   Dynamic service transactions can fail for a number of reasons, as
   listed in the state machines of section 9.4. Rather than include
   still more counters for each different failure reason, they are
   grouped into a single count, e.g docsQosDynamicAddFails.  Again, this
   object exists in both directions, so that locally originated vs
   remotely originated transaction failures are counted separately.
   Further troubleshooting of transaction failures will require vendor-
   specific queries and operation.


2.2.7  docsQosServiceFlowLogTable

   This table contains a log of the Service Flows no longer existing in
   the docsQosServiceFlowTable. It is intended to be periodically polled
   by traffic monitoring and billing agents. It is implemented only at
   the CMTS.

   It contains a chronological log of SF session statistics, including a
   total count of packets and octets transferred on the SF.  It includes

INTERNET-DRAFT<draft-ietf-ipcdn-qos-mib-07.txt>February 2003



   time stamps of the SF creation and deletion time, as well as its
   number of active seconds. The active second count is the count of
   seconds that the SF had a non-empty Active Qos Parameter Set, i.e. it
   was eligible to pass data.  For unicast SFs, it includes the CM MAC
   address associated with the flow for billing reference purposes.

   The maximum number of log records kept by a CMTS, and the duration
   that a log record is maintained in the table is vendor-specific.  An
   explicit control object is provided so that the monitoring
   application can explicitly delete records it has read.


2.2.8  docsQosServiceClassTable

   This table defines the Service Class Name and references a Qos
   Parameter Set for each Service Class defined in a CMTS.  It is
   indexed by the Service Class Name string itself.  The table is read-
   create on a CMTS, and is not implemented in a CM.  Each entry of the
   docsQosServiceClassTable should define a template for flows in a
   given direction (upstream or downstream). Some parameters of the
   docsQosServiceClassTable are specific to a particular direction, and
   so their values are not-applicable when used as a template for flows
   in the other direction.



2.2.9  docsQosServiceClassPolicyTable


   The docsQosServiceClassPolicyTable can be referenced by the
   docsDevFilterPolicyTable of [9] in order to have a "policy" that
   classifies packets to a named Service Class. This is one mechanism by
   which "external" entities (like an SNMP manager) may control the
   classification of packet for QOS purposes. Entries are indexed by a
   small integer docsQosServiceClassPolicyIndex.  They provide a Service
   Class Name and a Rule Priority.  A policy referencing a row of this
   table intends the packet to be forwarded on a Service Flow
   "belonging" to the named Service Class. See the section "Externally
   Administered Classification", below.

   This table is implemented on both the CM and CMTS, and is read-create
   on both.


2.2.10  docsQosPHSTable

   The Payload Header Suppression (PHS) feature of DOCSIS 1.1 permits
   packets to replace the unchanging bytes of the Ethernet, IP, and UDP
   headers with a one-byte index when transmitting on the cable network.
   This is especially useful for IP Telephony packets, where such
   suppression can result in almost twice the number of calls supported

   within the same upstream channel.

   Each entry of the table corresponds to a PHS Rule as described in
   section 8.4 of [4].  The rules are identified by their corresponding
   service flow ID and docsQosPktClassId. A PHS rule is associated with
   exactly one classifier.  The table is therefore indexed by the tuple
   { ifIndex, docsQosServiceFlowId, docsQosPktClassId}.

   This table is read-only, and MUST be implemented on both the CM and
   CMTS when PHS is supported.


2.2.11  docsQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable

   The docsQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable provides describes the mapping of CM
   mac addresses to the  Service Flow Ids that are uniquely identified
   with that CM.  External applications may collect statistics on all
   packets flowing through a CM by determining the SFID of all of its
   flows, and then collecting the statistics of packets and bytes for
   each flow.

   Downstream multicast service flows are not indicated in the
   docsQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable because they are not associated with
   only one CM.




3.  Externally Administered Classification

   Docsis 1.1 provides rich semantics for the classification of packets
   to service flows with it Service Flow Classifier table. Service Flow
   Classifiers may be created statically in the DOCSIS CM configuration
   file, or may be created dynamically with Dynamic Service Addition
   (DSA) and Dynamic Service Change (DSC) DOCSIS MAC messages.

   Several major issues arose with the concept of externally
   administered classification, i.e. should an external SNMP manager be
   permitted to create classification rows? One problem was the co-
   ordination of classifier IDs, since such an approach would require
   either separate classifier ID number spaces or objects to co-ordinate
   both internal and external classifier ID assignments.  A more serious
   problem, however, was the requirement that external creation of SF
   Classifiers would require "knowledge" of the individual Service Flow
   ID for service flows by external applications.  It was strongly felt
   by the committee that SFIDs should remain an internal Docsis object,
   and not be transmitted as part of protocol flows, e.g. for IP packet
   telephony signaling.  Docsis 1.1 introduced the concept of named
   Service Classes for ease of administration within a domain of CMs and
   CMTSs.  What was desired was to permit external classification of
   packets to a Service Class, not a particular Service Flow.

INTERNET-DRAFT<draft-ietf-ipcdn-qos-mib-07.txt>February 2003



   The DOCSIS committee therefore decided to use the already-defined IP
   Packet Filter Table [9] for the external classification of packets
   for QOS purposes.  The docsDevIpPacketFilterTable defines similar
   packet matching criteria as docsQosPktClassTable, but it matches a
   packet to an arbitrary "policy set" instead of a particular Service
   Flow. One of the policies in the policy set then selects the Service
   Class of the SF on which to forward the packet.  The
   docsQosServiceClassPolicyTable of this MIB defines the Service Class
   Name to which a packet is classified.

   The interaction of external and internal packet classification is
   depicted below.

          Figure 2: Docsis Packet Classification


   The processing of an outgoing packet proceeds as follows:

          1.  The packet is first checked for matches with rows of the
              docsDevIpFilterTable. If it matches, the matching row
              provides a docsDevFilterPolicyId integer.

          2.  The docsDevFilterPolicyId indexes into one (or more) rows
              of docsDevFilterPolicyTable. Each row provides an
              arbitrary RowPointer (docsDevFilterPolicyPtr),
              corresponding to a policy to be applied to the packet.

          3.  This MIB defines a docsQosServiceClassPolicyTable whose
              entries may be pointed to by docsDevFilterPolicyPtr in

              order to administratively classify packets to a named
              DOCSIS Service Class.  The docsQosServiceClassPolicyEntry
              provides a Service Class Name (SCN) as
              docsQosServiceClassPolicyName and a classification rule
              priority as docsQosServiceClassPolicyRulePriority. These
              are submitted to the device's Docsis MAC Layer entity as a
              special form of the MAC_DATA.request primitive, as
              described in Section E.2.1 of [4].

          4.  The MAC Layer selects an SFID ("Y") of an active Service
              Flow belonging to the named class, choosing an SF
              arbitrarily if there is more than one.

          5.  The packet is then classified according to the
              docsQosPktClassTable, which may classify the packet to a
              different SFID "X".  Associated with the classifier is a
              docsQosPktClassPriority.

          6.  In the event of a conflict between the SCN-determined SFID
              and the classified SFID, the greater of
              docsQosPktClassPriority and
              docsQosServiceClassPolicyRulePriority determines which
              SFID is selected to forward the packet.

        A packet which does not match a docsQosServiceClassPolicyEntry
        is directly submitted to the Docsis MAC layer, where the
        docsQosPktClassTable selects the SID on which it is to be
        forwarded.

        By convention (in [4]), the "internal" docsQosPktClassPriority
        values should be in the range of 64-191, while the "external"
        priorities may be either in the range 192-255 to override the
        internal classification or the range 0-63 to be overridden by
        internal classification.

        This classification mechanism applies both upstream from the CM
        and downstream from the CMTS.

                    configured on the CM or CMTS.
                    The model is that a packet either received
                    as input from an interface or transmitted
                    for output on an interface may be compared
                    against an ordered list of rules pertaining to
                    the packet contents. Each rule is a row of this
                    table. A matching rule provides a service flow
                    id to to which the packet is classified.
                    All rules need to match for a packet to match
                    a classifier.

                    The objects in this row correspond to a set of
                    Classifier Encoding parameters in a DOCSIS

                    indicates which particular parameters were present
                    in the classifier as signaled in the DOCSIS message.

                    which particular parameters were signaled in
                    the original registration or dynamic service
                    request message that created the QOS Parameter Set.

                    In many cases, even if a QOS Parameter Set parameter
                    was not signaled, the DOCSIS specification calls
                    for a default value to be used. That default value
                    is reported as the value of the corresponding object
                    in this row.

                    Many objects are not applicable depending on
                    the service flow direction or upstream scheduling
                    type.  The object value reported in this case
                    is specified in the DESCRIPTION clause.

                creates or modifies an Admitted QOS Parameter Set for a

                Name instead of providing explicit QOS Parameter
                Set values. In this case, the CMTS populates
                the QOS Parameter Set with the applicable
                corresponding values from the named Service Class.
                Subsequent changes to a Service Class row do *not*
                affect the QOS Parameter Set values of any service flows
                already admitted.

5.  Security Considerations


   This MIB relates to a agent which will provide metropolitan public
   internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects
   represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large
   number of end-users [9].  Manipulation of the
   docsQosServiceClassTable and docsQosServiceClassPolicyTable may allow
   an end-user to increase their service levels, or affect other end-
   users in either a positive or negative manner.  In addition,
   manipulation of docsQosServiceFlowLogControl could allow an attacker
   to remove logs of packet and byte counts forwarded on a service flow.
   If such logs were used for billing, the attacker would obtain free
   service.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

     o    The docsQosServiceClassTable provides a template of QOS
          parameters such as maximum rate limits for a named service
          class. Changing these parameters would allow an attacker to
          obtain unauthorized class of service.

     o    The docsQosServiceClassPolicyTable applies CMTS vendor
          proprietary policies for packet forwarding, including
          dropping, scheduling, notification, or other policies.
          Changing this table could  allow an attacker to deny service
          to all subscribers of the CMTS or grant the attacker
          unauthorized forwarding policies.

     o    The docsQosServiceFlowLogControl object controls the deletion
          of entries in the docsQosServiceFlowLogTable, which acts as a
          historical "detail record" of DOCSIS service flow packets and
          bytes transmitted. Such records may be used for billing
          purposes, so the unauthorized deletion of the records can
          result in free service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
   the values of these objects when sending them over the network via
   SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the docsQosPktClassTable or

          docsQosPHSTable can allow an attacker to learn IP addresses
          permitted to have enhanced quality of service, for possible
          spoofing.  This table typically contains the IP addresses
          involved in voice-over-IP sessions, for example.

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the docsQosParamSetTable
          allows an attacker to learn the names of service classes
          which are permitted to have enhanced QOS service, and the
          values of that enhanced service. That name can be referenced
          in an unauthorized DOCSIS cable modem configuration file to
          obtain enhanced service.

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the docsQosServiceFlowTable
          can tell an attacker when service flows are active, e.g.
          when a voice-over-IP call is in progress.

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the
          docsQosServiceFlowStatsTable, docsQosUpstreamStatsTable,
          docsQosDynamicServiceStatsTable, docsQosServiceFlogLogTable,
          and docsQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable can tell an attacker the
          volume of traffic to and from any service flow in the system,
          resulting in loss of privacy of the amount and direction of
          data transfer.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [12],
   section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
   mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).  Further, deployment of
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is
   RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
   It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
