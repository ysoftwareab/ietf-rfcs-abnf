Abstract

   This document collects information required for the creation a
   complete Presence and IM system using SIMPLE and other IETF
   protocols. This information has been spread out across numerous other
   internet drafts and RFCs. The document tries to put everything
   together, discussing the servers involved, security mechanisms, call
   flows, etc. The goal of this document is that someone, who is not an
   expert in the IETF protocols, can read this document and understand
   how the IETF protocols can be used for building a complete system and
   how it should work.

Internet-Draft    SIP/SIMPLE Based Presence and IM Architecture        February 2003


1. Introduction

   SIMPLE, SIP and SIPPING groups seems to be the most active groups in
   the IETF. Currently there are more then a hundred active I-Ds. This
   document tries to summarize the work in the SIMPLE group by defining
   what are the possible architectures for the creation of a SIMPLE
   based presence and IM system.

   The document starts by a definitions section in which we define the
   entities and the concepts that will serve us while we describe the
   architecture. The definitions sections is followed by a high level
   architecture that defines a very basic presence and IM architecture.

   The document continues with a specifications section in which we
   survey the current RFCs and active internet-drafts that will be
   referred throughout the document. These specifications are actually
   the building blocks of the systems described.

   After the introductory sections there are two major parts to this
   document: The server centric view of the possible systems, in which
   we describe the possible server deployments of a presence and IM
   systems. The second major part of the document is the user centric
   view in which we describe basic and advanced scenarios of presence
   and IM from the UA's point of view.

   Note that this is only the very first draft of the document. Most of
   it is still TBD.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]

3. Definitions

   This document uses terms as defined in various internet-drafts and
   RFCs. See Section 5 for the complete list and description of
   specifications used in the document.

      [TBD. This section will contain a lot of definitions that we will
      need. Need to specify for each definition, the specification it
      was taken from, Noting definitions that are defined in this
      document.]

   Presence User Agent (PUA): A Presence User Agent manipulates presence
      information for a presentity. This manipulation can be the side
      effect of some other action (such as sending a SIP REGISTER
      request to add a new Contact) or can be done explicitly through
      the publication of presence documents. We explicitly allow
      multiple PUAs per presentity. This means that a user can have many
      devices (such as a cell phone and Personal Digital Assistant
      (PDA)), each of which is independently generating a component of
      the overall presence information for a presentity. PUAs push data
      into the presence system, but are outside of it, in that they do
      not receive SUBSCRIBE messages, or send NOTIFY messages.

   Presence Agent (PA): A presence agent is a SIP user agent which is
      capable of receiving SUBSCRIBE requests, responding to them, and
      generating notifications of changes in presence state. A presence
      agent must have knowledge of the presence state of a presentity.
      This means that it must have access to presence data manipulated
      by PUAs for the presentity. One way to do this is by co-locating
      the PA with the proxy/registrar. Another way is to co-locate it
      with the presence user agent of the presentity. However, these are
      not the only ways, and this specification makes no recommendations
      about where the PA function should be located. A PA is always
      addressable with a SIP URI that uniquely identifies the presentity
      (i.e, sip:joe@example.com). There can be multiple PAs for a
      particular presentity, each of which handles some subset of the
      total subscriptions currently active for the presentity. A PA is
      also a notifier (defined in RFC 3265 [6]) that supports the
      presence event package.

   Presence Server: A presence server is a physical entity that can act
      as either a presence agent or as a proxy server for SUBSCRIBE
      requests. When acting as a PA, it is aware of the presence
      information of the presentity through some protocol means. When
      acting as a proxy, the SUBSCRIBE requests are proxied to another
      entity that may act as a PA.

   Edge Presence Server: An edge presence server is a presence agent
      that is co-located with a PUA. It is aware of the presence
      information of the presentity because it is co- located with the
      entity that manipulates this presence information.

   Registrar: A registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER requests and
      places the information it receives in those requests into the
      location service for the domain it handles.

   Location Service: A location service is used by a SIP redirect or
      proxy server to obtain information about a callee's possible
      location(s).  It contains a list of bindings of address-of- record

      keys to zero or more contact addresses. The bindings can be
      created and removed in many ways; this specification defines a
      REGISTER method that updates the bindings.


4. High Level Architecture

   This section describes a very high level of a presence and IM system.
   The intention of this section is to provide a basis for the
   description of the more complex system further on.

      [TBD. Relate between entities and specification documents.]


4.1 Single Server System

   A system of a single presence server to which user agents are
   connected will look like the following,


                 +---------+    +----------------+
                 |Presence |    | Authentication |
                 | Server  |    |     Server     |
                 +---------+    +----------------+
                      ^                 ^
                      |                 |
                      |                 V
                      |           +------------+
                      |           | Registrar/ |
                      |           |  Locator   |
                      |           +------------+
                      |                  ^
                      |     +---------+  |
                      +---->|  Proxy  |<-+
                            +---------+
                               ^^^^^
                               |||||
                               VVVVV
                            User Agents


                                Figure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates a very simple (or even simplistic) presence and
   IM architecture of a single server. Users connect through a proxy to
   the system. They proxy directs their logon (REGISTER)requests to the
   registrar that uses a back-end authentication directory for
   authenticating the users. Subscription and notifications requests are

   directed to the presence server that serves them. Sending instant
   messages can be done directly between the users or via the proxy.

4.2 Multiple Server System

   A system of multiple servers to which user agents are connected will
   look like the following,


                     +---------+         +---------+
                     | Single  |         | Single  |
                     | Server  |  o o o  | Server  |

                                Figure 2

   Figure 2 illustrates a more complex scenario where there are multiple
   units of a single server system. Users may connect to each of the
   single server systems. Following issues arise:

   o  Mapping of users to their servers - Users may have their presence
      list and other information stored at one of the servers. When a
      user logs on, its server side storage has to be retrieved from the
      appropriate server. Furthermore, changes to the server side
      storage has to be replicated to the appropriate server

   o  Replication of presence information - When a user logs on to one
      of the servers and uploads its presence information, other users
      that are logged on to other servers may subscribe on the user.
      There should be a way of replicating the presence information
      between the servers or at least letting other users know where a
      certain user is logged on.

      [TBD. How the above problems are solved.]

5.1 IMPP/CPIM Specifications

   The IMPP working group was the first group at the IETF to start
   working on presence and IM protocols. A protocol was not defined by
   the IMPP group but very important basic documents were produced.

   o  RFC2778 [2] - The basic IETF document for presence and IM. Defines
      an abstract model for a presence and instant messaging system. It
      defines the various entities involved, defines terminology, and
      outlines the services provided by the system. The goal is to
      provide a common vocabulary for further work on requirements for
      protocols and markup for presence and instant messaging.

   o  RFC2779 [3] - The second basic IETF document for presence and IM.
      The document defines the requirements for presence and IM service.
      The requirements include: Scalability, Format, Security etc.

   o  draft-ietf-impp-cpim-pidf [8] - Specifies the Common Presence and
      Instant Messaging (CPIM)Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) as
      a common presence data format for CPIM-compliant Instant Messaging
      and Presence protocols, and also defines a new media type
      "application/cpim-pidf+xml" to represent the XML MIME entity for
      PIDF.

   o  draft-ietf-impp-cpim-msgfmt [9] - Defines the mime type 'Message/
      CPIM', a message format for protocols that conform to the Common
      Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM) specification.

   o  draft-ietf-impp-pres [10] - One of three related documents
      [10][11][12]. Defines a common semantics and data formats for
      presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence
      services.

   o  draft-ietf-impp-im [11] - One of three related documents
      [10][11][12]. Defines common semantics and data formats for
      instant messaging to facilitate the creation of gateways between
      instant messaging services.

   o  draft-ietf-impp-srv [12] - One of three related documents
      [10][11][12]. Provides guidance for locating the resources
      associated with URIs that employ the schemes of PRESENTITIES URIs
      ('pres') as defined in [10] and the INSTANT INBOXES URIs ('im') as
      defined in [11].


5.2 SIMPLE Group Specifications

   The SIMPLE group defines the extensions required for the SIP protocol

Internet-Draft    SIP/SIMPLE Based Presence and IM Architecture        February 2003


   in order to be able to implement presence and IM system. Following is
   a list of the active specifications that are group documents or were
   submitted to the group. Each specification is followed by a short
   description of what each specification provides. The documents were
   divided into several categories.

5.2.1 Presence

   Following documents define the notification mechanisms and
   requirements for presence notifications using the SIP protocol.

   o  draft-ietf-simple-presence [23] - The basic presence document for
      SIMPLE. Describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of presence.
      Subscriptions and notifications of presence are supported by
      defining an event package within the general SIP event
      notification framework [6].

   o  draft-moran-simple-pres-filter-reqs [27] -  Defines a set of
      structured requirements whereby an event subscriber (client) may
      specify when notifications are sent to it and what the contents
      should be.

   o  draft-khartabil-simple-presence-filter [24] - Defines a presence
      filter package. The package provides the mechanism whereby a
      watcher can specify the presence event filtering rules, using XML,
      for the presence agent (PA) and how that PA is to behave when
      receiving such filter.

   o  draft-lonnfors-simple-presinfo-deliv-reqs [25] - Presents
      requirements for a solution for delivering presence information
      that aids in reducing and increasing efficiency of devices that
      have constrains as low data processing capabilities, small display
      and limited battery power. Other limitations may be caused by the
      interface between the terminal and the network, i.e. over radio
      links with high latency and low bandwidth.

   o  draft-lonnofors-simple-partial-notify [26] - Presents a solution
      for delivering presence information that aids in reducing and
      increasing efficiency of devices that have constrains as low data
      processing capabilities, small display and limited battery power.
      Other limitations may be caused by the interface between the
      terminal and the network, i.e. over radio links with high latency
      and low bandwidth. The solution introduces a new MIME-type
      "partial notifications" and a Require header extension
      "partial-notification".

5.2.2 Messaging

   Following documents define requirements and ways to implement a
   session of messages. Note that the MESSAGE method RFC is a SIP group
   document [7].

   o  draft-rosenberg-simple-messaging-requirements [21] - Defines a set
      of requirements for new capabilities for instant messaging and
      presence in SIP-based systems such as delivery confirmations and
      is typing indicators.

   o  draft-campbell-simple-im-sessions [20] - The document describes a
      method of initiating and managing message sessions using SIP. The
      media session is established using a SIP INVITE, just as a normal
      audio or video session would be established.

   o  draft-sparks-simple-jabber-sessions [22] -  Explores modeling
      jabber message streams [38] as media sessions, and how they  can
      be initiated with the Session Initiation Protocol.  It also
      explores how these sessions can be integrated into existing
      session-based multimedia communication applications.


5.2.3 Lists - Events and Manipulation

   Traditional presence and IM systems usually enable users to store a
   list of presences on which they subscribe on the server side. The
   users logging on to the system do not have to send the list every
   time they logon. Following documents deal with requirements and
   models for having parallel possibilities in the SIMPLE protocols.

   o  draft-ietf-simple-event-list [17] - Presents an extension to the
      Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The extension enables
      subscribing to a homogeneous collection of event packages. Instead
      of the   subscriber sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource
      individually, the subscriber can subscribe to an entire
      collection, and then receive notifications when the state of any
      of the resources in the collection changes.

   o  draft-ietf-simple-data-req [16] - Provides a framework and
      requirements for data manipulations for presence. These data
      manipulations include: presentity list, adding/removing
      presentities and authorization lists.

   o  draft-isomaki-simple-list-man-sem [18] - Proposes a semantics for
      SIMPLE list manipulation protocol. No protocol is defined yet.

5.2.4 Publish

   SIMPLE users that need to publish their presence document to the
   presence server were using two types of workrooms:

   o  Using the REGISTER method for uploading the presence document.

   o  Using other protocols for uploading the presence document

   Following documents describe how it can be done via the SIP protocol
   while defining a new PUBLISH method

   o  draft-ietf-simple-publish-reqs [28] - Defines requirements for
      publishing event state used within the framework for SIP Event
      Notification  (RFC3265 [6]). The first application of this
      extension is targeted at the publication of presence information.

   o  draft-olson-simple-publish [30] - Describes an extension to the
      Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The purpose of this extension
      is to create a means for publishing event state used within the
      framework for SIP Event Notification (RFC3265 [6]). The first
      application of this extension is targeted at the publication of
      presence information.

   o  draft-niemi-simple-publish-framework [29] - Describes an extension
      to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The purpose of this
      extension is to provide an extensible framework for publication of
      SIP specific data. This extension derives from the recent Internet
      Draft defining the PUBLISH method, but instead of using the SIP
      events framework, it introduces a specific publication framework
      for the publish mechanism. The main motivations for decoupling
      publications from events are that the event framework is not
      overloaded, and the applicability of the PUBLISH method to problem
      sets similar to those surfacing in the publication of event state
      is improved. The SIP publication framework is neither intended for
      general data manipulation, nor is it intended to foster any
      discussion on the issue of using SIP for everything.


5.2.5 Watchers

   Watcher information refers to the set of users subscribed to a
   particular resource within a particular event package. Watcher
   information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe, are
   approved, or are rejected. A user can subscribe to this information,
   and therefore learn about changes to it.

   o  draft-ietf-simple-winfo-package [32] - Defines the watcher



Houri & Hansen          Expires August 25, 2003                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    SIP/SIMPLE Based Presence and IM Architecture        February 2003


      information template-package for the SIP event framework.  This
      event package is a template-package because it can be applied to
      any event package, including itself.

   o  draft-ietf-simple-winfo-format [31] - Defines an XML format for
      watcher information for a resource.


5.2.6 SIMPLE/CPIM Related Docs

   Following documents define a mapping between the IMPP/CPIM documents
   (Section 5.1) or define ways to extend what is defined in IMPP/CPIM.

   o  draft-ietf-simple-cpim-mapping [13] - Defines how the SIMPLE work
      group SIP events package for distribution of presence information
      [23] and the MESSAGE extension for the transport of instant
      messages map to the abstract CPIM service [10][11][12], in order
      to interoperate with other CPIM compliant presence and instant
      messaging services.

   o  draft-campbell-simple-cpimmsg-sessions [19] -  Describes a message
      session mechanism based on the Common Presence and Instant
      Messaging message format [9].

   o  draft-kyzivat-simple-prescaps-reqts [14] - Sets forth requirements
      for the definition of elements for representation of SIP specific
      features within the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)[8], as
      well as for guidelines on how to use these new elements with PIDF
      to represent the capabilities of a SIP User Agent Server.

   o  draft-lonnfors-simple-prescaps-ext [15] - Proposes extensions to
      Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)[8] to be used within the
      SIMPLE based presence systems in order to enable building better
      applications.


5.2.7 Wireless

   o  draft-kiss-simple-presence-wireless-reqs [33] - Defines
      requirements for Presence Service based on 3GPP specifications and
      wireless environment characteristics.

   o  draft-niemi-simple-im-wireless-reqs [34] - Lists the requirements
      specific to 3GPP wireless Instant Messaging systems.

5.3 Relevant SIP Group Specifications

   Following SIP RFCs are very relevant to this document:

   o  RFC3261 [4] - The basic document of Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP).

   o  RFC3263 [5] - Describes the DNS procedures used by SIP to allow a
      client to resolve a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) into the
      IP address, port, and transport protocol of the next hop to
      contact.  These procedures also allow a server to send a response
      to a backup client if the primary client has failed.

   o  RFC3265 [6] - Provides an extensible framework by which SIP nodes
      can request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain
      events have occurred. The event notification mechanisms defined
      are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all
      classes of event subscription and notification.

   o  RFC3428 [7] - Defines the MESSAGE method as an extension to SIP
      that allows the transfer of Instant Messages. Since the MESSAGE
      request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request
      routing and security features of the SIP protocol. MESSAGE
      requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts. MESSAGE
      requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal
      usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.
      MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated
      by some other SIP request.


5.4 Relevant SIPPING Group Specifications

   The SIPPING group is responsible for defining requirements for SIP
   and SIMPLE work. Following is an initial list of SIPPING documents
   that are relevant to the architecture described in this document.

      [TBD. Other relevant SIPPING documents?]

   o  draft-niemi-sipping-event-throttle-reqs [35] - The document
      defines requirements for all event packages to specify a maximum
      rate at which event notifications are generated by a single
      notifier.  Such a limit is provided in order to reduce network
      congestion. In addition to the fixed limits introduced by specific
      event packages, further mechanisms for limiting the rate of event
      notification are also allowed to be defined by event package
      specifications but none have been specified so far. This memo
      discusses the requirements for a throttle mechanism that allows a
      subscriber to further limit the rate of event notification.

Internet-Draft    SIP/SIMPLE Based Presence and IM Architecture        February 2003


   o  draft-rosenberg-sipping-conferencing-framework [36] - Defines a
      framework for how conferencing in SIP can occur. Note that the
      basic definition of SIP defines dialogs that are two-party by
      default. The framework in the document describes the overall
      architecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for
      multi-party conferencing.

   o  draft-johnston-sipping-cc-conferencing [37] - Defines conferencing
      call control features for SIP.  The document builds on the
      Conferencing Requirements and Framework documents [36] to define
      how a tightly coupled SIP conference works. The approach is
      explored from different user agent (UA) types perspective:
      conference-unaware, conference-aware and focus UAs.  The use of
      URIs in conferencing, OPTIONS for capabilities discovery, and call
      control using REFER are covered in detail with example call flow
      diagrams.


6. Types of Deployments

   Several types of presence and IM systems deployments are described:

   o  Enterprise (Single Domains of Trust)- A presence and IM system
      that is built for an enterprise use. The employees of the
      enterprise is usually authenticated using the same credentials
      that they use for other operations within the enterprise. The
      system is usually located within the secured enterprise network

   o  Federated Systems - Several networks that have created a
      federation between them. In these systems a user is able to
      inter-operate with users on other systems. There is no need for
      each user of being  authenticated since the authentication is done
      at the level of each system.

   o  Public Systems Interconnecting - A public system that enables
      registered users to use the services of the system (as AOL, MSN,
      Yahoo). The users in each public system do not belong to the same
      organization and therefore can not be trusted as a whole as in
      enterprise systems.

   o  Open Systems - Users do not belong to an organization and are not
      registered to use the services of a public system. The services
      that the users will use will be freely available on the network
      while peer to peer operations between users will be very common in
      these system

      [TBD. Are there other types of deployments?]
