1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in [RFC8175].
   It provides the exchange of link related control information between
   DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP
   defines a base set of mechanisms as well as support for possible
   extensions.  This document defines one such extension.

   Some modem technologies support mobile ad hoc network (MANET)
   forwarding where connectivity to destinations is provided via
   forwarding in intermediate modems.  This document refers to
   forwarding by intermediate modems as 'multi-hop forwarding'.  example
   using . DLEP Destination messages can be used to report such
   reachable destinations, see [RFC8175], but do not provide any
   information related to the number or capacity of the hops.  The
   extension defined in this document enables modems to inform routers
   when multi-hop forwarding is being used, and routers to request that
   modems change multi-hop forwarding behavior.  The extension defined
   in this document is referred to as "Multi-Hop Forwarding", where each
   modem that transmits/sends data to reach a particular destination is
   counted as a hop.

   It is important to note that the use of the hop control mechanism
   defined in this can result in connectivity changes and even loss of
   the ability to reach one or more destinations.  The defined mechanism

Internet-Draft          DLEP Multi-Hop Extension              March 2019


   will report such connectivity changes, but the details of what a
   router does or how it reacts to such are out scope of this document.

   This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in Section 2
   which is used to indicate the use of the extension, and three new
   DLEP Data Items in Section 3.

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Extension Usage and Identification

   The use of the Multi-Hop Forwarding Extension SHOULD be configurable.
   To indicate that the extension is to be used, an implementation MUST
   include the Multi-Hop Forwarding Extension Type Value in the
   Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported Data Item
   is sent and processed according to [RFC8175].

   The Multi-Hop Forwarding Extension Type Value is TBA1, see Section 5.

3.  Extension Data Items

   Three data items are defined by this extension.  The Hop Count Data
   Item is used by a modem to provide the number of modem hops traversed
   to reach a particular destination.  The Hop Control Data Item is used
   by a router to request that a modem alter connectivity to a
   particular destination.  The Suppress Forwarding Data Item is used by
   a router to request that a modem disable multi-hop forwarding on
   either a device or destination basis.

3.1.  Hop Count

   The Hop Count Data Item is used by a modem to indicate the number of
   modem that transmits/sends data to reach a particular destination,
   i.e., hops, between the modem and a specific destination.  In other
   words, each hop represents a transmission and the number of hops is
   equal to the number of transmissions required to go from a router
   connected modem to the destination's connected modem.  The minimum
   number of hops is 1, which represents transmission to destinations
   that are directly reachable via the router's locally connected modem.

Internet-Draft          DLEP Multi-Hop Extension              March 2019


   The data item also contains an indication of when a destination which
   currently has a hop count of greater than one (1) could be made
   directly reachable by a modem, e.g., by re-aiming an antenna.

   The Hop Count Data Item SHOULD be carried in the Destination Up,
   Destination Update, Destination Announce Response, and Link
   Characteristics Response Messages when the Hop Count to a destination
   is greater than one (1).

   A router receiving a Hop Count Data Item can use this information in
   its forwarding and routing decisions, and specific use is out of
   scope of this document.  The absence of the Hop Count Data Item MUST
   be interpreted by the router as a Hop Count value of one (1).

   The format of the Hop Count Data Item is:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Data Item Type                | Length                        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |P|  Reserved   |   Hop Count   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Data Item Type:  TBA2

   Length:  2

   P:

      The P-bit indicates that a destination is potentially directly
      reachable.  When the P-bit is set, the router MAY request a direct
      link to the associated destination using the Hop Control Data Item
      described below.  This field MUST be ignored when the value
      contained in the Hop Count field is one (1).

   Reserved:

      MUST be set to zero by the sender (a modem) and ignored by the
      receiver (a router).

   Hop Count:

      An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the number of modem hops
      required (i.e., number of times a packet will be transmitted) to
      reach the destination indicated in the message.  The special value
      of 255 (0xFF) is used to indicate that the number of hops is an
      unknown number greater than one (1).  This field MUST contain a

Internet-Draft          DLEP Multi-Hop Extension              March 2019


      value of at least one (1) if the associated destination is
      reachable.

      A value of zero (0) is used to indicate that processing of a Hop
      Control action, see Section 3.2, has resulted in the destination
      no longer being reachable.  A zero value MUST NOT be used in any
      message other then a Link Characteristics Response Message.

3.2.  Hop Control

   The Hop Control Data Item is used by a router to request a change in
   connectivity to a particular destination, or in multi-hop processing
   on a device wide basis.  A router can request multi-hop reachable
   destination be changed to a single hop.  A router can also indicate
   that the modem terminates a previous direct connectivity request to a
   particular destination.

   The Hop Control Data Item MAY be carried in a Session Update Message
   sent by a router when the control applies to the whole device, or a
   Link Characteristics Request Message when the control applies to a
   particular destination.

   A modem that receives the Hop Control Data Item in a Link
   Characteristics Request Message SHOULD take whatever actions are
   needed to make the change indicated by the data item for the
   associated destination MAC address.  Once the change is made, fails
   or is rejected, the modem MUST respond with a Link Characteristics
   Response Message containing an updated Hop Count Data Item.  Note
   that other destinations can be impacted as a result of the change and
   such changes are reported in Destination Down and Destination Update
   Messages.  The modem MUST notify the router of each destination that
   is not identified in the Link Characteristics Response Message and is
   no longer reachable via a Destination Down Message.  The modem MUST
   also notify the router of each destination that is not identified in
   the Link Characteristics Response Message and has a changed Hop Count
   impacted via a Destination Update Message.

   Failures may occur for multiple reasons, for example, the
   transmission characteristics of the link don't support the one-hop
   connection at the time of the request.  Requests may be rejected by
   local policy.

   A modem that receives the Hop Control Data Item in a Session Update
   Message SHOULD take whatever actions are needed to make the change
   indicated by the data item for all known destinations.  Once the
   change is made, or fails or is rejected, the modem MUST respond with
   a Session Update Response Message with an appropriate Status Code.
   Destination specific impact resulting from the processing of a Hop

   Control Data Item in a Session Update Message is provided via
   Destination Down and Destination Update Messages.  The modem MUST
   notify the router of each destination that is no longer reachable via
   a Destination Down Message.  The modem MUST notify the router of any
   changes in Hop Counts via Destination Update Messages.

   The format of the Hop Control Data Item is:

        0                   1                   2                   3

                    Table 1: Hop Control Actions Values

3.2.1.  Reset

   The Reset Action requests that the default behavior be restored.
   When received in a Session Update Message message, a modem MUST clear
   all control actions that have previously been processed on a device
   wide basis, and revert to its configured behavior.  When received in
   a Link Characteristics Request Message, a modem MUST clear all
   control actions that have previously been processed for the
   destination indicated in the message.

3.2.2.  Terminate

   The Terminate Action is only valid on a per destination basis and
   MUST NOT be sent in a Session Update Message message.  It indicates
   that a direct connection is no longer needed with the destination
   identified in the message.  This request has no impact for multi-hop
   destinations and may fail even in a single hop case, i.e. can result
   in the Hop Count to the destination not being impacted by the
   processing of the request.

3.2.3.  Direct Connection

   The Direct Connection is only valid on a per destination basis and
   MUST NOT be sent in a Session Update Message message.  It indicates
   that the modem SHOULD attempt to establish a direct connection with
   the destination identified in the message.  This action SHOULD only
   be sent for destinations for which the Hop Count is greater than 1
   and has the P-Bit set in the previously received Hop Count Data Item.
   Results of the request for the destination identified in the message
   are provided as described above.

3.2.4.  Suppress Forwarding

   The Suppress Forwarding Action is used by a router to indicate to its
   peer that multi-hop forwarding performed by the modem is to be
   suppressed.  A router may request that multi-hop forwarding may be
   suppressed on a device wide or destination specific basis.

   A modem which receives the Suppress Forwarding Data Item in a Session
   Update Message MUST suppress multi-hop forwarding on a device wide
   basis.  This means that data traffic originating from the modem's
   peer router SHALL only be sent by the modem to destinations that are
   one modem hop away, and that any data traffic received by the modem
   from another modem that is not destined to the peer router SHALL be
   dropped.  Impact to destination hop counts are provided to the router
   by the modem as described above.

   A modem which receives the Suppress Forwarding Data Item in a Link
   Characteristics Request Message MUST suppress multi-hop forwarding
   for only the destination indicated in the message.  This means that
   data traffic originating from the modem's peer router SHALL be sent
   by the modem to the destination indicated in the Link Characteristics
   Request Message only when it is one modem hop away.  Notably, data
   traffic received by the modem from another modem can be forwarded by
   the modem per its normal processing.  Results are provided as
   described above.

Internet-Draft          DLEP Multi-Hop Extension              March 2019


4.  Security Considerations

   The extension enables the reporting and control of forwarding
   information by DLEP capable modems.  The extension does not
   inherently introduce any additional threats above those documented in
   [RFC8175].  The approach taken to Security in that document applies
   equally when running the extension defined in this document.

   This extension does define one mechanism that is worth particular
   note.  This extension includes a Hop Control mechanism, see
   Section 3.2, that is similar to the Link Characteristics Request
   Message defined in [RFC8175] in that it can impact the set of
   destinations reported as reachable.  With the Link Characteristics
   Request Message, this risk is implicit.  With the Hop Control
   mechanism defined in this document it is more likely.  From a
   security perspective, implementations should be aware of this
   increased risk and may choose to implement additional configuration
   control mechanisms to ensure that the Hop Control mechanism is only
   used under conditions intended by the network operator.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the assignment of 3 values by IANA.  All
   assignments are to registries defined by [RFC8175].  It also requests
   creation of one new registry.

5.1.  Extension Type Value

   This document requests 1 new assignment to the DLEP Extensions
   Registry named "Extension Type Values" in the range with the
   "Specification Required" policy.  The requested value is as follows:

                      +------+----------------------+
                      | Code | Description          |

5.2.  Data Item Values

   This document requests 2 new assignments to the DLEP Data Item
   Registry named "Data Item Type Values" in the range with the
   "Specification Required" policy.  The requested values are as
