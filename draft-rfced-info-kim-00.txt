      Update of Korean Character Encoding for Internet Messages

Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering task Force (IETF), its areas,
   and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other

Abstract
   Since RFC 1557, which is a Korean character encoding for internet
   messages, was distributed in 1993, most mailers have been implemented
   using it. However, it's been reported many occurrences of incompatible
   transfer of Korean mail messages such as broken mail messages.
   Therefore certain features are need to be extended, and ambiguous
   contents must be clarified. This document updates RFC 1557 to resolve
   above matters.
   This memo provides information for the Internet community. This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

Introduction

   This document updates the processing method being used to represent
   Korean characters in Internet messages defined by RFC 1557. It can
   be used in encoding or decoding Korean Character in 7bit mail
messages
   only. This document also describes the encoding method for including 
   multipart message and mail header with Korean characters.
   Other text subtypes, rich text and similar forms of text, are beyond
   the scope of this document.

Processing of Multipart message with Korean characters

   According to RFC 1521, it confines available scope to each part in
the 
   Multipart message. That is, in the case of Korean message, the header
   and body encoding of each part must be redefined.

Encoding for mail header with Korean characters

   In the case of mail headers with Korean characters, it is possible to
   encode entire header or only Korean characters. However a single
   token such as file name should be encoded as a whole.

Application of KS C 5601

   KS C 5601 noted in RFC 1557 is confined to only Wanseong code as 
   specified in KS C 5601-1987 and  KS C 5601-1989.

Internet Draft         Korean Message Processing          December 1996

Correction of RFC 1557

  Because there is a missing ")" in 40th line of 2nd page of RFC 1557,
  it must be corrected as following :
  segment = SO 1*(one-of-94 one-of-94 SI ; ( Octal, Decimal.) 
  --> segment = SO 1*(one-of-94 one-of-94) SI  ; ( Octal, Decimal.)

Examples

* Hex digits in [ ] in the examples represent 2 byte Korean characters

   1. Processing of Multipart message with Korean characters

      Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="MAIL-boundary"
      This is a multipart message in MIME format.

      --MAIL-boundary
      Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-kr
      Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

      <ESC>$)C<SO>@L0M@:<SI> <SO>C9<SI><CRLF>
      <SO>9xB0<SI> <SO>:;9.@T4O4Y<SI>.

      ...... (skip)

      --MAIL-boundary
      Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-kr
      Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

      <ESC>$)C<SO>@L0M@:<SI> <SO>5N<SI><CRLF>
      <SO>9xB0<SI> <SO>:;9.@T4O4Y<SI>.

       --MAIL-boundary
       Content-Type: image/gif
       Content-Transfer-Encoding: Base64
       Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="test.gif"
