1.  Introduction

   A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make
   machines or network resources unavailable to their intended users.
   In most cases, sufficient scale can be achieved by compromising
   enough end-hosts and using those infected hosts to perpetrate and
   amplify the attack.  The victim in this attack can be an application
   server, a client, a router, a firewall, or an entire network.

   In order to mitigate a DDoS attack while still providing service to
   legitimate entities, it is necessary to identify and separate the
   majority of attack traffic from legitimate traffic and only forward
   the latter to the entity under attack, which is also known as
   "scrubbing".  Depending on the type of attack, the scrubbing process
   may be more or less complicated, and in some cases, e.g. a bandwidth
   saturation, it must be done upstream of the DDoS attack target.

   DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) defines an architecture to help
   solve these issues (see [I-D.ietf-dots-architecture]).  In the DOTS
   architecture, a DDoS attack target is associated with a DOTS client
   which can signal a DOTS server for help in mitigating an attack.  The
   DOTS client and DOTS server (collectively referred to as DOTS agents)
   can interact with each other over two different channels: a signal
   and a data channel, as illustrated in (Figure 1).

                  Figure 1: DOTS signal and data channels

   The DOTS signal channel is primarily used to convey information
   related to a possible DDoS attack so appropriate mitigation actions
   can be undertaken on the suspecT traffic.  The DOTS data channel is
   used for infrequent bulk data exchange between DOTS agents in the aim
   to significantly augment attack response coordination.

   In this document, we define the overall information model and data
   model for the DOTS signal channel and data channel.  The information
   and data models are designed to adhere to the overall DOTS
   architecture [I-D.ietf-dots-architecture] , the DOTS use case
   scenarios, and the DOTS requirements [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements] .

2.  Notational Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-architecture].

3.  Information Model

   [Editor's note: The following is very much -00 work in progress...]

   The Information Model is broken into 3 separate pieces:

   o  General, which describes the overall structure of the information
      model

   o  Signal Channel specific

   o  Data Channel specific

   Following these, specific information elements to be used by the
   above are described.

Internet-Draft           DOTS Information Model           September 2016


3.1.  General

   Security services in the form of authentication, authorization,
   message integrity and confidentiality are assumed to be handled by
   lower layers (e.g.  DTLS or TLS) and hence they do not form part of
   the information model.

   o  Note: Not clear this is (operationally) sufficient to support the
      mutual authentication between DOTS client and DOTS server and the
      following authorization aspects governed by the service
      relationship that's assumed to be in place between the two.

   General operation and structure:

   o  Base-line functionality (with protocol and data model version)

   o  Extended functionality (negotiated, mandatory, optional, incl.
      data model versioning)

   o  Request/response and asynchronous delivery (signal channel)

   o  DOTS server discovery [Editors' note: Assume provisioned or DNS-
      based for now - data model]

3.2.  Signal Channel Specific

   Signal Channel Messages:

   o  Start session (signal channel)

   o  Stop session

   o  Open Data Channel

   o  Close Data Channel

   o  Redirect

      *  [Editor's note: At the IETF Berlin meeting, there was
         discussion around using anycast to possibly avoid redirection -
         do we keep "redirect" ?]

   o  Heartbeat

   o  Status (peer-health, incl. attack status, mitigation status and
      mitigation efficacy)

Internet-Draft           DOTS Information Model           September 2016


      *  [Editor's note: Some of these may be separate messages per the
         following]

   o  Client Signal specific: "request mitigation", "stop mitigation",
      "request mitigation status", ("mitigation efficacy update" ?)

   o  Server Signal specific: ("mitigation status" ?)

3.3.  Data Channel Specific

   Data Channel Messages:

   o  Open Data Channel

   o  Close Data Channel

   o  Redirect

   o  Bulk data exchange (blacklists, whitelists, filters,
      aliases\names)

3.4.  Information Elements

   Protocol version

   Attack Target

   o  [Editor's note: may be superfluous given Mitigation Scope below"]

   Agent Id (identity for each DOTS client and server, contains a least
   a domain portion that can be authenticated)

   Blacklist (define, retrieve, manage and refer to)

   Whitelist (defined, retrieve, manage and refer to)

   Information about the attack (e.g. targeted port range, protocol or
   scope)

   o  [Editor's note: Not clear this is really different from
      "Mitigation Scope" below - taken from requirement OP-006]

   Attack telemetry (collected behavioral characteristics defining the
   nature of a DDoS attack)

   Mitigator feedback (attack mitigation feedback from server to client,
   incl. mitigation status [start, stop, metrics, etc.], attack ended
   and information about mitigation failure)

Internet-Draft           DOTS Information Model           September 2016


   Mitigation efficacy (attack mitigation efficacy feedback from client
   to server)

   Mitigation failure (unsupported target type, mitigation capacity
   exceeded, excessive "clean traffic", out-of-service, etc.)

   Mitigation Scope: Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) prefixes,
   BGP prefix, URI, DNS names, E.164, "resource group alias", port
   range, protocol, or service

   o  [Editor's note: comes from requirements - not clear how "protocol"
      and "service" are defined.  Also, consider which URI schemes]

   o  [Editor's note: It would probably be useful to structure
      mitigation scope and related information (like telemetry,
      blacklist, etc.) into different "types", since different types of
      targets will have different parameters and different DOTS servers
      may support differnt types of attack targets]

   Mitigation Scope Conflict: Nature and scope of conflicting mitigation
   requests received from two or more clients

   Resource Group Alias (define in data channel, refer to in signal/data
   channel; aliases for mitigation scope)

   Mitigation duration (desired lifetime - renewable)

   Peer health (? - measure of peer health)

   Filters

   Filter-actions: rate-limit, discard

   Acceptable signal lossiness (for unreliable delivery)

   Heartbeat interval

   Data Channel Address

   o  [Editor's note: For discussion (not entirely aligned with current
      architecture draft text); assumes establish signal channel first
      and learn data channel address through it (would be useful for
      redirection as well and makes it easier for signal and data
      channel to terminate on different entities)]

   Extensions: standard, vendor-specific, supported
