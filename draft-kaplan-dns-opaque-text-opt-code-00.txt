1. Introduction 
    
   In certain circumstances, DNS clients querying a private DNS server 
   need to provide the server with some additional private data to 
   facilitate the lookup process.  The additional data is in the form 
   of a text string, which needs to be provided in the DNS query 
   request.  The Extension Mechanism for DNS (EDNS) defined in 
   [RFC2671] provides a suitable means by which to encode such a string 
   into the DNS request, using the OPT RR and a new EDNS Option code 
   indicating this text field use.  This document requests IANA for 
   assignment of such an Option code. 
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
    
3. Applicability 
    
   This draft requests a new Option code value based on [EDNS0].

4. OPTION-DATA Format 
    
   The format of the OPTION-DATA contents is an ascii-text string, with 
   no character termination (the OPTION-LENGTH field identifies the 
   length).   
    
   Although the text string should be opaque in general, for the 
   private use envisioned for it the contents of the text string are a 
   URI, typically a SIP URI.  One example is a SIP/SIPS/TEL-URI, 
   including the "sip:", "sips:", or "tel:" schemes.  Non-Ascii 
   characters, or characters not allowed in the ABNF for a SIP-
   URI/SIPS-URI/TEL-URI format per [RFC3261] or [RFC3966] MUST be 
   escaped per those formats. 
    
   The usage and source of the text content is outside the scope of 
   this document.  It is of a hop-by-hop nature, not transitive. 
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   There are no specific security issues for this IANA request.  
    
    
6.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document will presumably register an appropriate Option code 
   with IANA, if it moves forward.
