                      Segment Routing Architecture
                draft-filsfils-spring-segment-routing-01

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node
   steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called
   segments.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or
   service-based.  A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node or
   global within an SR domain.  SR allows to enforce a flow through any
   topological path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state
   only at the ingress node to the SR domain.

   Segment Routing can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with
   no change on the forwarding plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS
   label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.
   The segment to process is on the top of the stack.  Upon completion
   of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack.

   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new
   type of routing extension header.  A segment is encoded as an IPv6
   address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list
   of IPv6 addresses in the routing extension header.  The segment to

   process is indicated by a pointer in the routing extension header.
   Upon completion of a segment, the pointer is incremented.

1.  Introduction

   With Segment Routing (SR), a node steers a packet through an ordered
   list of instructions, called segments.  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service-based.  A segment can have a
   local semantic to an SR node or global within an SR domain.  SR
   allows to enforce a flow through any path and service chain while
   maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.

   Segment Routing can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture (RFC
   3031) with no change on the forwarding plane.  A segment is encoded
   as an MPLS label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack
   of labels.  The active segment is on the top of the stack.  A
   completed segment is popped off the stack.  The addition of a segment
   is performed with a push.

   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 architecture (RFC2460),
   with a new type of routing extension header.  A segment is encoded as
   an IPv6 address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an
   ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing extension header.  The

   active segment is indicated by a pointer in the routing extension
   header.  Upon completion of a segment, the pointer is incremented.  A
   segment can be inserted in the list and the pointer is updated
   accordingly.

   Numerous use-cases illustrate the benefits of source routing either
   for FRR, OAM or Traffic Engineering reasons.

   This document defines a set of instructions (called segments) that
   are required to fulfill the described use-cases.  These segments can
   either be used in isolation (one single segment defines the source
   route of the packet) or in combination (these segments are part of an
   ordered list of segments that define the source route of the packet).

2.  Terminology

   Segment: a segment identifies an instruction

   SID: a Segment Identifier

   Segment List: ordered list of SID's encoding the topological and
   service source route of the packet.  It is a stack of labels in the
   MPLS architecture.  It is an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the
   IPv6 architecture.

   Active segment: the segment that MUST be used by the receiving router
   to process the packet.  It is identified by a pointer in the IPv6
   architecture.  It is the top label in the MPLS architecture.

   PUSH: the insertion of a segment at the head of the Segment list.

   NEXT: the active segment is completed, the next segment becomes
   active.

   CONTINUE: the active segment is not completed and hence remains
   active.  The CONTINUE instruction is implemented as the SWAP
   instruction in the MPLS dataplane.

   SR Global Block (SRGB): local property of an SR node.  In the MPLS
   architecture, SRGB is the set of local labels reserved for global
   segments.  In the IPv6 architecture, it is the set of locally
   relevant IPv6 addresses.

   Global Segment: the related instruction is supported by all the SR-
   capable nodes in the domain.  In the MPLS architecture, a Global
   Segment has a globally-unique index.  The related local label at a
   given node N is found by adding the globally-unique index to the SRGB
   of node N. In the IPv6 architecture, a global segment is a globally-
   unique IPv6 address.

   Local Segment: the related instruction is supported only by the node
   originating it.  In the MPLS architecture, this is a local label
   outside the SRGB.  In the IPv6 architecture, this is a link-local
   address.

   IGP Segment: the generic name for a segment attached to a piece of
   information advertised by a link-state IGP, e.g. an IGP prefix or an
   IGP adjacency.

   IGP-prefix Segment, Prefix-SID: an IGP-Prefix Segment is an IGP
   segment attached to an IGP prefix.  An IGP-Prefix Segment is always
   global within the SR/IGP domain and identifies an instruction to

   forward the packet over the ECMP-aware shortest-path computed by the
   IGP to the related prefix.  The Prefix-SID is the SID of the IGP-
   Prefix Segment.

   IGP-Anycast: an IGP-Anycast Segment is an IGP-prefix segment which
   does not identify a specific router, but a set of routers.  The terms
   "Anycast Segment" or "Anycast-SID" are often used as an abbreviation.

   IGP-Adjacency: an IGP-Adjacency Segment is an IGP segment attached to
   an unidirectional adjacency or a set of unidirectional adjacencies.
   An IGP-Adjacency Segment is local to the node that advertises it.

   IGP-Node: an IGP-Node Segment is an IGP-Prefix Segment which
   identifies a specific router (e.g. a loopback).  The terms "Node
   Segment" or Node-SID" are often used as an abbreviation.

   SR Tunnel: a list of segments to be pushed on the packets directed on
   the tunnel.  The list of segments can be specified explicitly or
   implicitly via a set of abstract constraints (latency, affinity,
   SRLG, ...).  In the latter case, a constrained-based path computation
   is used to determine the list of segments associated with the tunnel.
   The computation can be local or delegated to a PCE server.  An SR
   tunnel can be configured by the operator, provisioned via netconf or
   provisioned via PCEP.  An SR tunnel can be used for traffic-
   engineering, OAM or FRR reasons.

   Segment List Depth: the number of segments of an SR tunnel.  The
   entity instantiating an SR Tunnel at a node N should be able to
   discover the depth insertion capability of the node N. The PCEP
   discovery capability is described in
   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-segment-routing].

3.  Link-State IGP Segments

   Within a link-state IGP domain, an SR-capable IGP node advertises
   segments for its attached prefixes and adjacencies.  These segments
   are called IGP segments or IGP SIDs.  They play a key role in Segment
   Routing and use-cases
   ([I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-use-cases]) as they enable the
   expression of any topological path throughout the IGP domain.  Such a
   topological path is either expressed as a single IGP segment or a
   list of multiple IGP segments.

3.1.  IGP Segment, IGP SID

   The terms "IGP Segment" and "IGP SID" are the generic names for a
   segment attached to a piece of information advertised by a link-state
   IGP, e.g. an IGP prefix or an IGP adjacency.

Internet-Draft               Segment Routing                    May 2014


3.2.  IGP-Prefix Segment, Prefix-SID

   An IGP-Prefix Segment is an IGP segment attached to an IGP prefix.
   An IGP-Prefix Segment is always global within the SR/IGP domain and
   identifies the ECMP-aware shortest-path computed by the IGP to the
   related prefix.  The Prefix-SID is the SID of the IGP-Prefix Segment.

   A packet injected anywhere within the SR/IGP domain with an active
   Prefix-SID will be forwarded along the shortest-path to that prefix.

   The IGP signaling extension for IGP-Prefix segment includes the
   P-Flag.  A Node N advertising a Prefix-SID SID-R for its attached
   prefix R resets the P-Flag to allow its connected neighbors to
   perform the NEXT operation while processing SID-R. This behavior is
   equivalent to Penultimate Hop Popping in MPLS.  When set, the
   neighbors of N must perform the CONTINUE operation while processing
   SID-R.

   While SR allows to attach a local segment to an IGP prefix, we
   specifically assume that when the terms "IGP-Prefix Segment" and
   "Prefix-SID" are used, the segment is global (the SID is allocated
   from the SRGB).  This is consistent with
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-use-cases] as all the described
   use-cases require global segments attached to IGP prefixes.

   Multiple Prefix-SID's may be allocated to the same IGP Prefix (e.g.
   for Class of Service purpose).  Typically a single Prefix-SID is
   allocated to an IGP Prefix.

   A Prefix-SID is allocated from the SRGB according to a process
   similar to IP address allocation.  Typically the Prefix-SID is
   allocated by policy by the operator (or NMS) and the SID very rarely
   changes.

   The allocation process MUST NOT allocate the same Prefix-SID to
   different IP prefixes.

   If a node learns a Prefix-SID having a value that falls outside the
   locally configured SRGB range, then the node MUST NOT use the Prefix-
   SID and SHOULD issue an error log warning for misconfiguration.

   The required IGP protocol extensions are defined in
   [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions]and
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].

   A node N attaching a Prefix-SID SID-R to its attached prefix R MUST
   maintain the following FIB entry:

Internet-Draft               Segment Routing                    May 2014


      Incoming Active Segment: SID-R
      Ingress Operation: NEXT
      Egress interface: NULL

   A remote node M MUST maintain the following FIB entry for any learned
   Prefix-SID SID-R attached to IP prefix R:

      Incoming Active Segment: SID-R
      Ingress Operation:
         If the next-hop of R is the originator of R
         and instructed to remove the active segment: NEXT
         Else: CONTINUE
      Egress interface: the interface towards the next-hop along
                        the shortest-path to prefix R.

3.3.  IGP-Node Segment, Node-SID

   An IGP-Node Segment is a an IGP-Prefix Segment which identifies a
   specific router (e.g. a loopback).  The N flag is set.  The terms
   "Node Segment" or "Node-SID" are often used as an abbreviation.

   A "Node Segment" or "Node-SID" is fundamental to SR.  From anywhere
   in the network, it enforces the ECMP-aware shortest- path forwarding
   of the packet towards the related node as explained in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-use-cases].

   An IGP-Node-SID MUST NOT be associated with a prefix that is owned or
   advertised by more than one router within the same routing domain.

3.4.  IGP-Anycast Segment, Anycast SID

   An IGP-Anycast Segment is an IGP-prefix segment which does not
   identify a specific router, but a set of routers.  The terms "Anycast
   Segment" or "Anycast-SID" are often used as an abbreviation.

   An "Anycast Segment" or "Anycast SID" enforces the ECMP-aware
   shortest-path forwarding towards the closest node of the anycast set.
   This is useful to express macro-engineering policies or protection
   mechanisms as described in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-use-cases].

   The Anycast SID MUST be advertised with the N-flag unset.

3.5.  IGP-Adjacency Segment, Adj-SID

   An IGP-Adjacency Segment is an IGP segment attached to a
   unidirectional adjacency or a set of unidirectional adjacencies.  An

Internet-Draft               Segment Routing                    May 2014


   IGP-Adjacency Segment is local to the node which advertises it.  The
   SID of the IGP-Adjacency Segment is called the Adj-SID.

   The adjacency is formed by the local node (i.e., the node advertising
   the adjacency in the IGP) and the remote node (i.e., the other end of
   the adjacency).  The local node MUST be an IGP node.  The remote node
   MAY be an adjacent IGP neighbor) or a non-adjacent neighbor (e.g.: a
   Forwarding Adjacency, [RFC4206]).

   A packet injected anywhere within the SR domain with a segment list
   {SN, SNL}, where SN is the Node-SID of node N and SNL is an Adj- SID
   attached by node N to its adjacency over link L, will be forwarded
   along the shortest-path to N and then be switched by N, without any
   IP shortest-path consideration, towards link L. If the Adj-SID
   identifies a set of adjacencies, then the node N load- balances the
   traffic among the various members of the set.

   An "IGP Adjacency Segment" or "Adj-SID" enforces the switching of the
   packet from a node towards a defined interface or set of interfaces.
   This is key to theoretically prove that any path can be expressed as
   a list of segments as explained in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-use-cases].

   The encodings of the Adj-SID include the B-flag.  When set, the Adj-
   SID benefits from a local protection.

   A node SHOULD allocate one Adj-SIDs for each of its adjacencies.

   A node MAY allocate multiple Adj-SIDs to the same adjacency.

   A node MAY allocate the same Adj-SID to multiple adjacencies.

   Adjacency suppression MUST NOT be performed by the IGP.

   A node MUST install a FIB entry for any Adj-SID of value V attached
   to data-link L:

      Incoming Active Segment: V
      Operation: NEXT
      Egress Interface: L

   The Adj-SID implies, from the router advertising it, the forwarding
   of the packet through the adjacency identified by the Adj-SID,
   regardless its IGP/SPF cost.  In other words, the use of Adjacency
   Segments overrides the routing decision made by SPF algorithm.

3.5.1.  Parallel Adjacencies

   Adj-SIDs can be used in order to represent a set of parallel
   interfaces between two adjacent routers.

   A node MUST install a FIB entry for any locally originated Adjacency
   Segment (Adj-SID) of value W attached to a set of link B with:

      Incoming Active Segment: W

3.5.2.  LAN Adjacency Segments

   In LAN subnetworks, link-state protocols define the concept of
   Designated Router (DR, in OSPF) or Designated Intermediate System
   (DIS, in IS-IS) that conduct flooding in broadcast subnetworks and
   that describe the LAN topology in a special routing update (OSPF
   Type2 LSA or IS-IS Pseudonode LSP).

   The difficulty with LANs is that each router only advertises its
   connectivity to the DR/DIS and not to each other individual nodes in
   the LAN.  Therefore, additional protocol mechanisms (IS-IS and OSPF)
   are necessary in order for each router in the LAN to advertise an
   Adj-SID associated to each neighbor in the LAN.  These extensions are
   defined in [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].

3.6.  Binding Segment

3.6.1.  Mapping Server

   A Remote-Binding SID S advertised by the mapping server M for remote
   prefix R attached to non-SR-capable node N signals the same
   information as if N had advertised S as a Prefix-SID.  Further
   details are described in the SR/LDP interworking procedures
   ([I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-ldp-interop].

   The segment allocation and SRDB Maintenance rules are the same as
   those defined for Prefix-SID.

3.6.2.  Tunnel Headend

   The segment allocation and SRDB Maintenance rules are the same as
   those defined for Adj-SID.  A tunnel attached to a head-end H acts as
   an adjacency attached to H.

   Note: an alternative would consist in representing tunnels as
   forwarding-adjacencies ( [RFC4206]).  The Remote-Binding SID is
   preferred as it allows to advertise the presence of a tunnel without
   influencing the LSDB and the SPF computation.

3.6.3.  Mirroring Context

   TBD.

3.7.  Inter-Area Considerations

   In the following example diagram we assume an IGP deployed using
   areas and where SR has been deployed.

                 !          !
                 !          !
          B------C-----F----G-----K
         /       |          |     |
   S---A/        |          |     |
        \        |          |     |
         \D------I----------J-----L----Z (192.0.2.1/32, Node-SID: 150)
                 !          !
         Area-1  ! Backbone ! Area 2
                 !   area   !

                   Figure 1: Inter-Area Topology Example

   In area 2, node Z allocates Node-SID 150 to his local prefix
   192.0.2.1/32.  ABRs G and J will propagate the prefix into the
   backbone area by creating a new instance of the prefix according to
   normal inter-area/level IGP propagation rules.

   Nodes C and I will apply the same behavior when leaking prefixes from
   the backbone area down to area 1.  Therefore, node S will see prefix
   192.0.2.1/32 with Prefix-SID 150 and advertised by nodes C and I.

   It therefore results that a Prefix-SID remains attached to its
   related IGP Prefix through the inter-area process.

   When node S sends traffic to 192.0.2.1/32, it pushes Node-SID(150) as
   active segment and forward it to A.

   When packet arrives at ABR I (or C), the ABR forwards the packet
   according to the active segment (Node-SID(150)).  Forwarding
   continues across area borders, using the same Node-SID(150), until
   the packet reaches its destination.

   When an ABR propagates a prefix from one area to another it MUST set
   the R-Flag.
