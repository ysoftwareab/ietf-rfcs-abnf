1. Introduction

   This document provides a YANG data model for the Abstraction and
   Control of Traffic Engineered (TE) networks (ACTN) Virtual Network
   (VN) operation that is going to be implemented for the Customer
   Network Controller (CNC)- Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MSDC)
   interface (CMI).

Internet-Draft            ACTN VN YANG Model               October 2016


   The YANG model on the CMI is also known as customer service model in
   [Service-YANG]. The YANG model discussed in this document is used to
   operate customer-driven VNs during the VN computation, VN
   instantiation and its life-cycle operations stages.

   Note that the YANG model presented in this draft has two aspects:

   - VN pre-instantiation mode of operation (also known as VN compute);
   - VN instantiation mode of operation.

   The VN pre-instantiation mode of operation is concerned about
   service inquiry before making a formal request for VN instantiation.
   This operation is important for a customer to make sure the network
   can provide VN services it desires.

   The VN instantiation mode of operation is concerned about
   instantiating VNs. In the VN instantiation mode, the CNC provides
   the VN service definition that includes VN members, VN service
   objective, VN service policy and preferences, etc. Upon receipt of a
   VN instantiation request, the MDSC (in coordination with PNCs)
   executes service request into network operation that include
   creating tunnels/paths and securing network resources/slices for
   VNs.

   The YANG model discussed in this document basically provides the
   characteristics of VNs such as VN level parameters (e.g., VN ID, VN
   member, VN objective function, VN service preference, etc.),
   customer's end point characteristics (e.g., Customer Interface
   Capability, Access Points Interface characteristics, etc.), and
   other relevant VN information that needs to be known to the MDSC to
   facilitate ACTN VN operation.



1.1. Terminology

   Refer to [ACTN-Frame] and [RFC7926] for the key terms used in this
   document.

2. ACTN CMI context

   The model presented in this document has the following ACTN context.

   As defined in [ACTN-FW], a Virtual Network is a client view
   (typically a network slice) of the transport network.  It can be
   presented by the provider as a set of physical and/or abstracted
   resources. Depending on the agreement between client and provider
   various VN operations and VN views are possible.

     a) VN can be seen as an (or set of) e2e tunnel(s) from a customer
        point of view where an e2e tunnel is referred as a VN member.
        Each VN member (i.e., e2e tunnel) can then be formed by
        recursive aggregation of lower level paths at a provider level.
        Such end to end tunnels may comprise of customer end points,
        access links, intra domain paths and inter-domain link. In this
        view VN is thus a list of VN members.

     b) VN can also be seen as a terms of topology comprising of
        physical and abstracted nodes and links. The nodes in this case
        include physical customer end points, border nodes, and
        internal nodes as well as abstracted nodes. Similarly the links
        includes physical access, inter-domain and intra-domain links
        as well as abstracted links. The abstracted nodes and links in
        this view can be pre-negotiated or created dynamically.

   For both cases, the CNC can dynamically add VN elements. For case 1,
   the VN element is an end-to-end tunnel and for case 2, the VN
   element can be virtual nodes or virtual links.

   In the subsequent discussion, the first form of VN will be
   discussed.

                   Figure 2. Full Mesh Example for a VN



   In Figure 2, a VN has three members, namely, VN Member 1, VN member
   2, and VN member 3. VN Member 1 is an end-to-end tunnel identified
   by CE1-AP1 (source) and CE2-AP2 (destination). Similarly, VN Member
   2 by CE1-AP1 and CE3-AP3 and VN Member 3 by CE3-AP3 and CE2-AP2.
   This particular VN shown in Figure 2 is a full mesh connectivity
   across these three customer end-points.

   The set of assumptions that applies to this document is the
   following:

     - CNC is responsible for providing necessary Customer End-Points
        information to the MDSC via the CMI.
     - The access links (between Customer Edge (CE) Devices and the
        Provider Edge (PE) Devices) are assumed to have been
        provisioned prior to the VN instantiation request.
        Access point identifiers have been configured and therefore are
        known in both the CNC and the MDSC.

   It is also possible for the customer to create a VN which can be a
   hub and spoke or any other form of connectivity depending on its
   connectivity requirement. Each end-to-end tunnel may be
   unidirectional or bidirectional which is also depending on its
   connectivity requirements. The following figure shows some examples
   of a VN that can be represented in a different connectivity form
   depending on the customer's connectivity requirements.

              Figure 3. Different Connectivity Forms of a VN



   It is important to note that a VN can associate a multiple number of
   end-to-end tunnels (i.e., VN members) with one unique identifier.
   From a customer standpoint, this simplifies its VN operation
   significantly.

   The MDSC interacts with the CNC for the VN operation. Once the
   customer VN is requested by the CNC to the MDSC, the MDSC shall be
   responsible for translating and mapping the VN request into specific
   network centric-models (e.g., TE-tunnels [TE-Tunnel], TE-topology
   [TE-TOPO], etc.) to coordinate the multi-domain network operations
   with PNCs.

2.1. Multi-sources and multi-destinations

   In creating a virtual network, the list of sources or destinations
   or both may not be pre-determined by the customer. For instance, for
   a given source, there may be a list of multiple-destinations to
   which the optimal destination may be chosen depending on the network
   resource situations. Likewise, for a given destination, there may
   also be multiple-sources from which the optimal source may be
   chosen. In some cases, there may be a pool of multiple sources and
   destinations from which the optimal source-destination may be
   chosen.

   The following YANG module is shown for describing source container
   and destination container. See details in Section 4.
