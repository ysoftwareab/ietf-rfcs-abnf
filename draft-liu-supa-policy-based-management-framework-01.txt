Abstract

   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines a set of rules
   that define how services are designed, delivered, and operated
   within an operator's environment independent of any one particular
   service or networking device. This document describes the SUPA basic
   architecture, its elements and interfaces.

1. Introduction

   The rapid growth in the variety and importance of traffic flowing
   over increasingly complex enterprise and service provider network
   architectures makes the task of network operations and management
   applications and deploying new services much more difficult. In
   addition, network operators want to deploy new services quickly and
   efficiently. Two possible mechanisms for dealing with this growing
   difficulty are the use of software abstractions to simplify the
   design and configuration of monitoring and control   operations and
   the use of programmatic control over the configuration and operation
   of such networks. Policy-based management can be used to combine
   these two mechanisms into an extensible framework.

Internet-Draft SUPA policy based management framework        July 2016


   Policy rules can be used to express high-level network operator
   requirements directly, or from a set of management applications, to
   a network management or element system. The network management or
   element system can then control the configuration and/or monitoring
   of network elements and services.

   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) will define a generic
   policy information model (GPIM) [SUPA-info-model] for use in network
   operations and management applications. The GPIM defines concepts
   and terminology needed by policy management indepednent of the form
   and content of the policy rule. The ECA Policy Rule Information
   Model (EPRIM) [SUPA-info-model] extends the GPIM to define how to
   build policy rules according to the event-condition-action paradigm.

   Both the GPIM and the EPRIM are targeted at controlling the
   configuration and monitoring of network elements throughout the
   service development and deployment lifecycle. The GPIM and the EPRIM
   will both be translated into corresponding YANG [RFC6020] modules
   that define policy concepts, terminology, and rules in a generic and
   interoperable manner; additional YANG modules may also be defined
   from the GPIM and/or EPRIM to manage specific functions.

   The key benefit of policy management is that it enables different
   network elements and services to be instructed to behave the same
   way, even if they are programmed differently. Management
   applications will benefit from using policy rules that enable
   scalable and consistent programmatic control over the
   configuration and monitoring of network elements and services.

2. Framework for Generic Policy-based Management

   This section briefly describes the design and operation of the SUPA
   policy-based management framework.

2.1. Overview

   Figure 1 shows a simplified functional architecture of how SUPA is
   used to define policies for creating network element configuration
   and monitoring snippets. SUPA uses the GPIM to define a consensual
   vocabulary that different actors can use to interact with network
   elements and services. The EPRIM defines a generic structure for
   imperative policies. The GPIM, as well as the combination of the
   GPIM and EPRIM, are converted to generic YANG data modules. The
   IETF produces the modules, and IANA is used to register the module
   and changes to it.

Internet-Draft SUPA policy based management framework        July 2016


   In one possible approach, SUPA Generic & ECA Policy YANG Data
   modules together with the Resource and Service YANG data models
   specified in IETF (which define the specific elements that will be
   controlled by policies) are used by the Service Interface Logic.
   This Service Interface Logic creates appropriate input mechanisms
   for the operator to define policies   (e.g., a web form or a script)
   for creating and managing the network configuration. The operator
   interacts with the interface, which is then translated to
   configuration snippets.

   Note that YANG models may not exist. In this case, the SUPA generic
   policy YANG data modules serve as an extensible basis to develop new
   YANG data models for the Service Interface Logic to create
   appropriate input mechanisms for the operator to define policies.
   This transfers the work specified by the Resource and Service YANG
   data models specified in IETF into the Service Interface Logic,
   which is then translated to configuration snippets.

                          Figure 1 SUPA Framework



   Figure 1 is exemplary. The Operator actor shown in Figure 1 can
   interact with SUPA in other ways not shown in Figure 1. In addition,
   other actors (e.g., an application developer) that can interact with
   SUPA are not shown for simplicity.

   The EPRIM defines an Event-Condition-Action (ECA) policy as an
   example of imperative policies. An ECA policy rule is activated
   when its event clause is true; the condition clause is then
   evaluated and, if true, signals the execution of one or more
   actions in the action clause. Imperative policy rules require
   additional management functions, which are explained in section 2.2
   below.

   Figure 2 shows a SUPA Policy Model creating and communicating policy
   rules to two different Network Manager and  Network Controller
   elements.

   The Generic Policy Information Model (GPIM) was used to construct
   policies. The GPIM defines generic policy concepts, as well as two
   types of policies: ECA policy rules and declarative policy
   statements.

   An ECA policy rule is activated when its event clause is true; the
   condition clause is then evaluated and, if true, signals the
   execution of one or more actions in the action clause. This type of
   policy explicitly defines the current and desired states of the
   system being managed.

   A set of Generic Policy Data Models are then created from the GPIM.
   These YANG data model policies are then used to control the
   configuration of network elements that model the service(s) to be
   managed using policy.

   In Figure 2:
   A double-headed arrow with Cs means communication;
   A double-headed arrow with Ds means derived from.

   The network elements used in this framework are:

   SUPA Policy Model: represents one or more policy modules that
   contain the following entities:

   Generic Policy Information Model: a model for defining policy
   rules that are independent of data repository, data definition,
   query, and implementation languages, and protocol. This model is
   abstract and is used for design; it MUST be turned into a data model
   for implementation.

   Generic Policy Data Model: a model of policy rules for that are
   dependent of data repository, data definition, query, and
   implementation languages, and protocol.

   ECA Policy Rule Information Data Model (EPRIM): represents a policy
   rule as a statement that consists of an event clause, a condition
   clause, and an action clause. This type of Policy Rule explicitly
   defines the current and desired states of the system being managed.
   This model is abstract and is used for design; it MUST be turned
   into a data model for implementation.

   ECA Policy Rule Data Model: a model of policy rules derived from
   EPRIM, consist of an event clause, a condition clause, and an action
   clause.

   NM/NC: Network Manager / Controller, which represents one or more
   entities that are able to control the operation and management of a
   network infrastructure (e.g., a network topology that consists of
   Network Elements).

   Network Resource Data Model: a model of the physical and virtual
   network topology including the resource attributes (e.g., data rate
   or latency of links) and operational parameters needed to support
   service deployment over the network topology. An example of a
   network resource data model can be found in [ID.draft-contreras-
   supa-yang-network-topo].

   Network Element (NE), which can interact with local or remote NM/NC
   in order to exchange information, such as configuration information,
   policy enforcement capabilities, and network status.

          Figure 3 Relationship among Policy, Service and Resource

   In Figure 3:
   (1) policy relies on and is able to adjust service
   (2) policy relies on network ability provided by resource and is
   able to adjust resource
   (3) resource relies on network ability and is able to reserve and
   consume/occupy resource



2.2. Operation

   SUPA can be used to define various types of policies, including
   policies that affect services and/or the configuration of
   individual or groups of network elements. SUPA can be used by a
   centralized and/or distributed set of entities for creating,
   managing, interacting with, and retiring policy rules.

   The SUPA scope is limited to policy information and data models.
   SUPA will not define network resource data models or network
   service data models; both are out of scope. Instead, SUPA will make
   use of network resource data models defined by other WGs or SDOs.

   Declarative policies that specify the goals to achieve but not how
   to achieve those goals (also called "intent-based" policies) are out
   of scope for the initial phase of SUPA.

2.3. The GPIM and the EPRIM

   The GPIM provides a common vocabulary for representing concepts
   that are common to expressing different types of policy, but which
   are independent of language, protocol, repository, and level of
   abstraction.

   This enables different policies at different levels of abstraction
   to form a continuum, where more abstract policies can be translated
   into more concrete policies, and vice-versa. For example, the
   information model can be extended by generalizing concepts from an
   existing data model into the GPIM; the GPIM extensions can then be
   used by other data models.

   The SUPA working group develops models for expressing policy at
   different levels of abstraction. Specifically, two models are
   envisioned (both of which are contained in the Generic Policy
   Information Model block in Figure 1:

   1. a generic model (the GPIM) that defines concepts and vocabulary
      needed by policy management systems independent of the form and
      content of the policy

   2. a more specific model (the EPRIM) that refines the GPIM to
      specify policy rules in an event-condition-action form

2.4. Creation of Generic YANG Modules

   An information model is abstract. As such, it cannot be directly
   instantiated (i.e., objects cannot be created directly from it).
   Therefore, both the GPIM, as well as the combination of the GPIM
   and the EPRIM, are translated to generic YANG modules.

   SUPA will provide guidelines for translating the GPIM (or the
   combination of the GPIM and the EPRIM) into concrete YANG data
   models    that define how to manage and communicate policies between
   systems.   Multiple imperative policy YANG data models may be
   instantiated   from the GPIM (or the combination of the GPIM and the
   EPRIM). In   particular, SUPA will specify a set of YANG data models
   that will   consist of a base policy model for representing policy
   management   concepts independent of the type or structure of a
   policy, and as   well, an extension for defining policy rules
   according to the ECA   paradigm.

   The process of developing the GPIM, EPRIM and the derived/translated
   YANG data models is realized following the sequence shown below.
   After completing this process and if the implementation of the YANG

   data models requires it, the GPIM and EPRIM and the
   derived/translated YANG data models are updated and synchronized.

   (1)=>(2)=>(3)=>(4)=>(3')=>(2')=>(1')

   Where, (1)=GPIM; (2)=EPRIM; (3)=YANG data models; (4)=
   Implementation; (3')= update of YANG data models; (2')=update of
   EPRIM; (1') = update of GPIM

   The YANG module derived from the GPIM contains concepts and
   terminology for the common operation and administration of policy-
   based systems, as well as an extensible structure for policy rules
   of different paradigms. The YANG module derived from the EPRIM
   extends the generic nature of the GPIM to represent policies using
   an event-condition-action structure.

   At the early stage of SUPA, we think quite some issues are left open,
   it is not so suitable to call this draft as "architecture". We would
   like to rename it to "framework". Later there may be a dedicated
   architecture document.
