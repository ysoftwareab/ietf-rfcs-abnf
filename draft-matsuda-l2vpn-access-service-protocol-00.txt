   Abstract 

   Access Service Network is a network where subscribers can be 
   connected to various ISPs/VPNs depending on the authentication 
   inforamtion presented by the subscribers. This draft describes a 
   signaling protocol based on PWE3 control protocol [PWE3-SIG] for 
   Access Service Network. The protocol makes it possible to set up 
   a pair of pseudo wires between a subscriber and an ISP/VPN with 
   minimum guaranteed bandwidth in Access Service Network.

1. Introduction 

     Access Service Network is a network where subscribers can be 
   connected to various ISPs/VPNs depending on the authentication 
   inforamtion presented by the subscribers. To implement Access Service 
   Network, L2TP is widely deployed. With L2TP, user packet data are 
   transported with PPP header, L2TP header, UDP header and IP header 
   (38 bytes in total) added.
     In this draft, we propose a protocol in which user packet data are 
   transported over pseudo wires realized by MPLS label stacking, thus 
   reducing the overhead. A pseudo wire is set up between a Network 
   Access Concentrator (NAC) accommodating subscribers and a Network 
   Server (NS) accommodating ISPs/VPNs using Generalized ID FEC Element 
   defined in [PWE3-SIG] in the proposed protocol. A Label Mapping 
   message used to establish a pseudo wire can include a TLV specifing 
   minimum guaranteed bandwidth between a subscriber and an ISP/VPN for 
   each direction. NAC uses RADIUS protocol [RADIUS], [RAD-TNL] to 
   discover NS.
     The protocol described in this draft can be used to implement 
   Ethernet access service authenticating a subscriber by 801.X and IP 
   access service authenticating a subscriber by PPPoE.


2. Network Model

     In this section, we describe the network elememts comprising an 
   Access Service Network. Figure 1 depicts the network model.

         Fig.1 Network Model of Access Service Network

   - Access Service Network :
   Access Service Network is a network where subscribers can be 
   connected to various ISPs/VPNs depending on the authentication 
   inforamtion presented by the subscribers.

MATSUDA                 Expires  August 2004                 [Page 2] 
Internet-Draft  Signaling for Access Service Network  February 2004 


   - NAC (Network Access Concentrator) :
   A provider edge router which has interfaces to accommodate 
   subscribers. NAC queries RADIUS server in Access Service Network 
   about NS with which a pair of pseudo wires needs to be established 
   using authentication information provided by a subscriber. NAC 
   corresponds to LAC in L2TP.

   - NS (Network Server):
   A provider edge router which has interfaces to accommodate ISPs/VPNs
   to which subscribers connect. NS acts as a proxy RADIUS server for 
   NAC in subscriber authentication and transfers RAIDUS requests/
   responses between NAC and RADIUS server in ISP/VPN. NS corresponds to
   LNS in L2TP.

   - Subscriber CE :
   Subscriber CE is a terminal or a network equipment owned by a 
   subscriber and it is connected to NAC. A subscriber is connected to 
   Access Service Network through Subscriber CE. By specifying which 
   ISP/VPN to connect to with subscriber authentication information, 
   Subscriber CE can connect to various ISPs/VPNs through Access Service
   Network. Subscriber CE runs some authentication protocol such as 
   PPPoE and 802.1X with NAC when connecting to NAC.

   - ISP/VPN CE :
   ISP/VPN CE is a network equipment owned by an ISP/VPN and it is 
   connected to NS. ISP/VPN is connected to Access Service Network 
   through ISP/VPN CE.

   - RADIUS Server in Access Service Network :
   This RADIUS server helps NAC discover NS to which a pair of pseudo 
   wires needs to be set up. When NAC sends Access-Request message to a
   RADIUS server in Access Service Network, the RADIUS server in Access
   Service Network returns the information about NS to which a pair of 
   pseudo wires needs to be set up.

   - RADIUS Server in ISP/VPN :
   RADIUS server in ISP/VPN acts as a RADIUS server for NS in subscriber
   authentication. It determines whether a subscriber should be allowed
   to access the ISP/VPN depending on the information sent by NAC 
   through NS.


3. Connection setup/release procedure between subscriber CE and ISP/VPN CE

     In Access Service Network, a connection between Subscriber CE and 
   ISP/VPN is established in the following three stages.

    (1) NS discovery by NAC
    (2) Subscriber CE authentication by NAC
    (3) Pseudo Wire setup/release between NAC and NS

   We will describe those stages.

3.1 NS discovery  by NAC

     In this section, we describe how NAC finds NS to which a pair of 
   pseudo wires needs to be set up using authentication informatino 
   provided by a Subscriber CE in connecting to NAC.
     When a Subscriber CE tries to connect to NAC using an 
   authentication protocol such as 802.1X and PPPoE, NAC must discover 
   NS which acts as a proxy RADIUS server in subscriber authentication
   and to which a pair of pseudo wires needs to be established first. 
   For that purpose, NAC sends RADIUS Access-Request message including 
   User-Name AVP the value of which is subscriber identifier provided by
   Subscriber CE to a RADIUS server in Access Service Network.
     Using value field of User-Name AVP in Access-Request message, 
   RADIUS server in Access Service Network resolves NS which acts as a
   proxy RADIUS server in subscriber authentication and to which a pair
   of pseudo wires needs to be established. If resolved successfully, 
   RADIUS server in Access Service Network returns Access-Accept message
   with Tunnel-Medium-Type AVP and Tunnel-Server-Endpoint AVP indicating
   NS address to NAC. If failed in resolving, RADIUS server in Access 
   Service Network returns Access-Reject message to NAC.


3.2 Subscriber CE authentication by NAC

     In this section, we describe how NAC authenticates a Subscriber CE
   in connecting to NAC.
     After discovering NS, NAC exchanges RADIUS messages with NS as a 
   proxy RADIUS server to authenticate a Subscriber CE. As a proxy 
   RADIUS server, NS transfers Access-Request message received from NAC
   to an appropriate RADIUS server in ISP/VPN determined by the value 
   field of User-Name AVP in Access-Request message indicating the 
   subscriber identity. Consider the case where Access Service Network
   is an IP access service network and needs to assign an IP address 
   prefix to a Subscriber CE. If a RADIUS server in ISP/VPN requests the
   RADIUS client to assign an IP address from its address pool by 
   including Framed-Pool AVP or Framed-IPv6-Pool AVP in Access-Accept 
   message, NS assigns one from an address pool configured in itself and
   replaces Framed-Pool AVP or Framed-IPv6-Pool AVP with Framed-IP-
   Address or Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP and transfers Access-Accept message
   to NAC. Minimum guaranteed bandwidth between Subscriber CE and 
   ISP/VPN CE for each direction is indicated in Vendor Specific AVP 
   included in Access-Accept message returned by a RADIUS server in 
   ISP/VPN. The format of the Vendor Specific AVP is defined in 4.1.
     NAC proceeds to establish a pair pseudo wires with NS if NS returns
   Access-Accept message, which means that a subscriber authentication 
   succeeded. NAC refuses to establish a connection with a Subscriber 
   CE if NS returns Access-Reject message, which means that the 
   subscriber authentication failed.

3.3 Pseudo Wire setup procedure between NAC and NS

     In this section, we describe how NAC sets up a pair of pseudo wires
   with NS.
     If NAC finds that it can satisfy the minimum guaranteed bandwidth 
   requirement for packet transport from Subscriber CE to ISP/VPN CE, 
   NAC sends a LDP Label Mapping message with Generalized FEC ID Element 
   TLV representing a connection between NAC and a Subscriber CE. 
   Label Mapping message includes Vendor Specific TLV indicating minimum 
   guaranteed bandwidth between Subscriber CE and ISP/VPN CE for each 
   direction. We describe the format of Generalized FEC ID Element and 
   Vendor Specific TLV in 4.2. NAC establishes a LDP session before 
   sending Label Mapping message if one is not established. NAC also 
   establishes an LSP with NAC as ingress LSR and NS as egress LSR if 
   necessary. If NAC finds that it can not satisfy the minimum
   guaranteed bandwidth requirement for packet transport from Subscriber
   CE to ISP/VPN CE, NAC refuses to establish a connection to a 
   Subscriber CE.
     On receiving a Label Mapping message from NAC, NS checks if it can
   satisfy the minimum guaranteed bandwidth requirement for packet 
   transport from ISP/VPN CE to Subscriber CE. If it can, NS sends a 
   Label Mapping message with Generalized FEC ID Element TLV SAII and 
   TAII of which are the reverse of those in Generalized FEC ID Element
   TLV received from NAC. If it can not, NS sends a Label Release 
   message to NAC.
     When NAC receives a Label Mapping message, it searches for a 
   Subscriber CE corresponding to Generalized FEC ID Element TLV in the
   Label Mapping message and finish establishing a connection with the 
   Subscriber CE. If NAC can not find the corresponding Subscriber CE, 
   NAC sends a Label Release message to the originating NS. When NAC 
   receives a Label Release message, it searches for a Subscriber CE 
   corresponding to Generalized FEC ID Element TLV in the Label Release
   message and refuses to establish a connection to a Subscriber CE.


3.4 Pseudo Wire Tear Down Procedure

     When a connection between a Subscriber CE and NAC is broken for
   some reason, NAC sends a Label Withdraw message to NS. On receiving a
   Label Withdraw message, NS searches for a LSP for Generalized FEC ID
   Element TLV SAII and TAII of which are the reverse of those in 
   Generalized FEC ID Element TLV received from NAC. If a LSP is found,
   NS sends a Label Withdraw mesasge for the FEC and tears down the LSP.
     If NS desires to tear down a pair pseudo wire, NS sends a 
   Label Withdraw messsage to NAC. On receiving a Label Withdraw 
   message, NAC searches for a LSP for Generalized FEC ID Element TLV 
   SAII and TAII of which are the reverse of those in Generalized FEC ID
   Element TLV received from NS. If a LSP is found, NAC sends a Label 
   Withdraw mesasge for the FEC and tears down the LSP.

4. Protocol Message Format
4.1 RADIUS related message format

     We describe the format of RADIUS Vendor Specific AVP [RADIUS] used 
   in this draft.
     This AVP indicates the minimum guaranteed bandwidth for pseudo wire 
   between Subscriber CE and ISP/VPN CE.

   - Vendor-ID
      The high-order octet is 0 and the low-order 3 octets are the SMI
      Network Management Private Enterprise Code of Mitsubishi Electric
      Corporation.

   - String
     "String filed" is structured as a sub-AVP.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  from ISP/VPN to Subscriber   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   *"Vendor Type" = 1.
   *"Vendor Length" = 8.
   *"Minimum Guaranteed Bandwidth from Subscriber to ISP/VPN" indicates
     the minimum guaranteed bandwidth from Subscriber to ISP/VPN in 
     byte/sec. This field is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision 
     floating-point number.
   *"Minimum Guaranteed Bandwidth from ISP/VPN to Subscriber" indicates 
     the minimum guaranteed bandwidth from ISP/VPN to Subscriber in 
     byte/sec. This field is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision
     floating-point number.

   Defining a format which is similar to Traffic Parameter TLV defined 
   by CR-LDP and can convey QoS related information is for further
   study.


4.2 LDP related message format
4.2.1 Generalized ID FEC Element format for Ethernet Access Service

     Type filed value of SAII and TAII and PW type field value for this
   appplication is to be assinged by IANA.
     Generalized ID FEC Element is defined in [PWE3-SIG]. In this draft,
   AGI field of Generalized ID FEC Element is not used. We describer 
   the format of SAII and TAII in the following.

   *"Router ID of NAC" is a 4 octet identifier of NAC unique in Access
     Service Network.
   *"Connection ID between Subscriber CE and NAC" is an identifier 
     which contains enough information for NAC to identify Subscriber CE
     (e.g. interface index plus PPPoE session ID for PPPoE session case,
     interface index to which Subscriber CE is connected for 801.1X 
     case). The value of "Connection ID between Subscriber CE and NAC" 
     is only meaningful to NAC and is of local significance. The length
     of "Connection ID between Subscriber CE and NAC" can be determined
     by subtracting 4 from Length field value of SAII.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   *"ISP/VPN identifier" is an identifier of ISP/VPN to which a 
     Subscriber CE is trying to connect. We assume that NAC can obtain 
     the value of "ISP/VPN identifier" from subscriber idetifer
     presented by the Subscriber CE when authenticating it and NS can 
     identify ISP/VPN from *"ISP/VPN identifier" using configuration 
     information. For example, if the subscriber idetifer is the form of
     user_id@isp_domain_name, isp_domain_name string can be used as 
     "ISP/VPN identifier".

   *"Address Type" indicates whether the IP address assigned to a 
     Subscriber CE is IPv4 or IPv6. The value 4 means IPv4 and the 
     value 6 means IPv6.
   *"Prefix Length" indicates the prefix length of the IP address 
     assigned to a Subscriber CE.
   *"Address Len" indicates the length of "IP Address" field in octets.
     This field should be 4 for IPv4 address and 16 for IPv6 address.
   *"IP Address" indicates the IP address assigned to a Subscriber CE.
   *"Connection ID between Subscriber CE and NAC" is an identifier 
     which contains enough information for NAC to identify Subscriber CE
     (e.g. interface index plus PPPoE session ID for PPPoE session case,
     interface index to which Subscriber CE is connected for 801.1X 
     case). The value of "Connection ID between Subscriber CE and NAC" 
     is only meaningful to NAC and is of local significance. The length
     of "Connection ID between Subscriber CE and NAC" can be determined
     by subtracting 4 from Length field value of SAII.

5.  Security Considerations

     The usage of LDP and RADIUS protocols in this draft does not 
   improve nor worsen the security problems related to LDP and RADIUS.


6.  IANA Considerations

     Type field value of SAII and TAII and PW type field value in 
   Generalized ID FEC for this appplication needs to be assigned by 
   IANA.
