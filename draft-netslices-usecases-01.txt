Abstract

   Network Slicing is meant to enable creating (end-to-end) partitioned
   network infrastructure which may include the user equipment, access/
   core transport networks, edge and central data center resources to
   provide differentiated connectivity behaviors to fulfill the
   requirements of distinct services, applications and customers.  In
   this context, connectivity is not restricted to differentiated
   forwarding capabilities but it covers also advanced service functions
   that will be invoked when transferring data within a given domain.

   The purpose of this document is to focus on use cases that benefit
   from the usefulness of network slicing.

   this context, connectivity is not restricted to differentiated
   forwarding capabilities but it also spans service, management and
   control plane support offered to a slice instance.

2.  Scope

   To maximize resource utilization and minimize infrastructure cost,
   services will need to operate over a shared network infrastructure,
   as against the traditional monolithic model operated either as
   dedicated network or as an overlay.  Service operators can utilize or
   benefit from Network Slicing through multi-tenancy, enabling
   different customized network infrastructures for different group of
   services across different network domains and operating them
   independently.

   In this document, multi-domain refers to combination of different
   kinds of connection-technology network domains.  For example, it may
   be a RAN, DSL etc in access; a fixed, wireless or mobile service
   provider network; as well as different technology domains in
   transport networks such as carrier ethernet, optical, MPLS, TE-tunnel
   etc.  Often, a combination of technology domains are under the same
   administrator's control but may also belong to different
   adminisitrative systems and may require cross-domain coordination.

   The document covers generalized as well as resource guaranteed
   service scenarios that can benefit by applying Network Slicing
   principles.

   The remaining document is organized as below:

   o  In Section 3, Network Slice as a Service(NSaaS) delivery model is
      described.

   o  In Section 4, 3GPP architecture for 5G is discussed as a use case
      so that those requirements may be taken into consideration during
      slicing activities in IETF.

   o  Use cases are discussed from 2 perspectives

      a  Existing scenarios: Several already deployed or existing
         examples that would further benefit when deployed through
         Network Slice paradigm are discussed in Section 5.

      b  Differentiated service scenarios: that must absolutely meet
         strict resource requirements, as if they use a dedicated
         infrastructure.  The example use cases are categorized in
         Section 6.

   o  End-to-end slicing requires awareness in a terminal to select a
      specific or many slices.  This is discussed in Section 7.2.

   o  In Section 8, the use case requirements are summarized which are
      inputs to the [I-D.qiang-netslices-gap-analysis].

3.  A Generalized Network Slice as a Service

   Network slicing instances share a common infrastructure, which
   provide flexible design of a logical network with specific network
   functions customized to support differentiated performance
   requirements of vertical industry through logical or physical system
   isolation and certain OAM tools.

   Traditionally, vertical industries run their services in a shared
   network environment upon which infrastructure owners and service
   providers offer standalone network capabilities including
   connections, storage and etc.  Network slicing paradigm enables
   supporting the requirements of a network slicing tenant to be met
   individually.  Hence it is anticipated that this type of new business
   model where network slice instances are leased to industry verticals
   as a service (i.e.  Network Slcing as a Service, NSaaS) may become a
   norm in the near future.

3.1.  Resource Centric Service Concept

   Network services specify a set of resource requirements to offer
   desired Quality of Experience (QoE) to it consumers, using features
   offered by the control and forwarding planes.  Traditional service
   guarantees are associated with resource attributes such as
   throughput, packet loss, latency, network bandwidth/burst or other
   bit rates and security.  In addition, redundancy and reliability are
   provided by the infrastructure to improve over all QoE.  More
   recently, concepts such as edge computing allow opportunistic
   placement of services to meet stringent requirments of low latency
   and/or high bandwidth applications.

   Clearly the description of service delivery is more diverse now than
   before and demands higher degree of resource engineering and agility.
   The motivation behind Network slicing paradigm is to enable new
   service deployments without having to build new network
   infrastructures or causing disruptions to already deployed services
   in the network.  In this regard, there are two primary
   characteristics NS should satisfy, a) Strict demand for network
   resource, b) Network Customization.

3.2.  Strict Resource Demand

   Several services are sensitive to response times and/or amount of
   bandwidth, e.g. realtime interactive multimedia, high bandwidth video
   feed or remote access to an enterprise network.  Failure to meet



Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   these criteria leads to service degradation.  Moreover, new industry
   verticals are evolving due to technological advancements in sensors,
   IoT, robotics and multi-media, along with new type of network
   interactions (both human-human or human-machine).  These impose even
   stricter resource and connectivity requirements.  The challenge lies
   in utilizing common network infrastructure and judiciously allocating
   available infrastructure resources.

3.3.  Network Customization

   To a network slice tenant, the ability to customize services
   dynamically is important.  Customization gives control to the
   operator of a slice to create, provision and change network resources
   to suit their service demands.  Customization enables decomposition
   of resources from an underlying network infrastructure and logically
   aggregate them as part of a slice.  These customizations also include
   placement and logical connection of the network functions based on
   the service requirements.

3.4.  NSaaS of Different Granularities

   In order to meet various requirements from the network slice tenant,
   NSaaS should be be provided with different granularities.  Some
   typical examples of granularities that a provider may offer are as
   follows.

   o  Network Domain - Network slice instances of different networks
      i.e.  access (wireless, fixed) network, transport network and core
      network.

   o  Access technologies - Network slice instances of different
      generations of cellular and fixed network technologies, i.e. 4G,
      WiFi, Passive Optical Network (PON) and DSL.

   o  SLA requirements - Network slice instances of different SLA
      requirements, i.e. low-latency network, legacy best-effort network
      and network with guaranteed-bandwidth.

   o  Vertical applications - Network slice instances of different
      industry verticals. i.e. manufacturing site, V2X, industrial IoT
      and smart city.

   o  OTT services - Network slice instances of different applications
      provided by OTT, i.e. messaging, payment, video streaming and
      gaming.

   During the realization of network slicing, it is also very important
   that sub-instance of a more general one can be provided with a finer

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   granularity.  In practice, it is up to the provider to decide the
   granularity to lease the network slice instances.

   Editor's note: please revisit definitions for consistency.

3.5.  Challenges in NSaaS

   The flexibility and customization of different network slicing
   granularity introduce many challenges, especially in terms of network
   management and orchestration.  As a network slice provider (provider
   of end-to-end slice orchestration), it is essential to have a
   comprehensive understanding of the network capability.  This requires
   that network connectivity and resources can be exposed to the network
   slice tenants - the differentiated services offerers.  Accordingly,
   network slice provider is able to orchestrate specific instances
   based on these exposed capabilities.

4.  Network Slicing in 3GPP Mobile Network

   Network Slicing is a core feature of the currently under development
   3GPP 5G phase 1 mobile system, because it makes it possible for
   different vertical applications, such as IoT and broadband
   applications, to be deployed over a common infrastructure.  More
   details can be found in [TS_3GPP.23.501], [TS_3GPP.23.502],
   [TR_3GPP.38.801], [TR_3GPP.33.899] and [TS_3GPP.28.500].

4.1.  Network Slices in 3GPP Systems

   In 3GPP systems a network slice is a complete logical network which
   provides telecommunication services and network capabilities.
   Distinct Radio Access Network (RAN) network slices and core network
   slices will interwork with each other to provide mobile connectivity.
   A device may access multiple network slices simultaneously through a
   single RAN.

   3GPP defines slice IDs (named (S-)NSSAI in the standard) composed of
   a Slice Service Type (SST) and optionally a Slice Differentiator
   (SD).  SST refers to an expected network behavior in terms of
   features and services (e.g. specialized for broadband or massive
   IoT), while SD helps distinguishing among several network slice
   instances.

   Figure 1 describes the general layout of Network Slicing in mobile
   networks.  A core network slice is composed, on the control plane
   side, of a Session Management Function (SMF), which manages PDU
   sessions, and, on the user plane side, of a User Plane Function (UPF)
   and possibly other functions.  It is interconnected with a RAN Slice
   to complete the user plane.  Some functions on the control plane are

   common and shared between multiple RAN and core network slices.  A
   primary example of such a shared function is the Access and Mobility
   management Function (AMF).

4.2.  Challenges

   A core challenge here is to identify or develop a set of technologies
   suitable to implement the infrastructure over which 3GPP Network
   Slicing will be built, without requiring major rework of the 3GPP
   specifications.  Among the specific challenges that an IETF NS
   framework will need to address, it will need to support sharing
   network functions between several slices, building slices recursively
   from smaller slices, implementing roaming across different domains,
   etc.  The following subsections describe creation, management and
   operation of 3GPP network slices as currently planned in the
   specifications, in order to better understand those challenges.

4.3.  Creating 3GPP Network Slices

   To create a network slice instance, mobile network operators will
   start by describing it by assembling together "Network Slice
   Subnets", which are smaller components included in a RAN or core
   network slice.  Network slice subnets include NFs and reserved
   network resources, in term of KPIs such as minimum and maximum
   throughput, delay, packet loss, etc.  Network slice subnets can be
   shared between several network slices.  Both network slices and their
   subnets are described by the operator through the OSS/BSS management
   system.  The OSS/BSS translates this input from the operator into

   descriptors that are sent to an orchestrator.  The orchestrator,
   through the rest of the NFV-MANO system, configures compute and
   network elements to create network slice subnets and compose them as
   a network slice.  Beyond creation, RAN or core network slice
   activation is orchestrated as the activation of individual subnets,
   possibly in a given order.

   Network slices are isolated from each other to avoid control plane
   congestion on one slice (e.g. using one SMF in slice dedicated for
   broadband applications) to affect the control plane of other slices
   (e.g. to affect potentially critical IoT applications).  Since some
   common core network functions (AMF, PCF, UDM, etc.) are shared
   between multiple dedicated core network slices, the interaction
   between shared NFs and NFs in dedicated network slices should be
   isolated from each other as well.

   Network slices creation will support different combinations of "n"
   network services, "m" client devices and "p" interconnections with
   external (sliced or non-sliced) networks and services.  In 3GPP, RAN
   and core network slices are typically dedicated to a certain type of
   network services such as broadband or IoT, but may serve one or more
   network services of this type.  Additionally, in some mobile
   networks, parts of the core network may not be implemented over a
   slice, while others are (e.g.  SMF could be in a slice, while common
   functions are not).  While this can lead to a sub-optimal isolation
   between slices, this effect can be partially compensated by over-
   provisioning non-sliced sections of the network.

4.4.  Managing 3GPP Network Slices

   Mobile network operators can modify the configuration of a RAN or
   core network slices, while it is in use.  Example of such operations
   include:

   o  Increase or decrease compute capacity of NFs

   o  Increase or decrease network capacity

   o  Update the configuration of NFs

   o  Add, replace or remove a NFs

   o  Add, replace or remove a Network Slice Subnet

   Some operations affecting a shared slice may not be possible without
   affecting other network slices, and in this case may be replaced by
   other operations: for example, instead of changing the configuration
   of a shared AMF to accommodate the needs of a SMF, another network

   slice subnet with an AMF may be created, and replace the original
   AMF's slice for this SMF.  The management system monitors performance
   of individual network slice components and coalesce performance data
   and events for the whole RAN or core network slice.  This includes
   user and control traffic load data, QoS/SLA data, e.g. indicating
   whether services were provided at expected QoS/SLA level.  The
   management system uses this information for example to decide to
   scale up or down NFs.  Performance data and events from a shared
   network slice component will be attributed by the 3GPP management
   system to one of the RAN or core network slices that contain or
   interact with this shared component.  To support roaming, mobile
   network operators will need to configure the interconnection between
   network slices on the home network and network slices on the visited
   network.  On the visited side, the operator ensures that the proper
   network slice is selected for a roaming device.  User traffic will
   flow through the visited network slice either directly to an external
   data network, or through the interconnected home network slice (both
   cases will need to be supported).  From the end user perspective only
   the performance of the whole (visited + home) network slice is
   important.  Mobile network operators may expose limited 3GPP network
   slice management to third party communication service providers
   (CSP), who may in turn consume this service or provide it to their
   own customers, as a form of "Slice as a Service" described
   in Section 3.  Using this interface, a CSP can request the creation
   of a network slice using specifications of NFs, isolation, security,
   performance requirements (such as traffic demand requirements for the
   coverage areas, QoS for service).  When an operator exposes
   management data (e.g. fault management data, performance data) about
   a network slice shared by multiple customers of a CSP, exposed
   management data of each customer can be isolated from each other.

4.5.  Operating 3GPP Network Slices

   Slice selection occurs in 2 phases: first, when initially registering
   with the network, the device lists the slice IDs it wishes support
   for.  This list could be part of the configuration of the device.
   The network uses it, among other information like device
   capabilities, subscription information and local operator policies,
   to pre-select one or more RAN slices and core network slices.  In
   this process, a set of 5G Common Control Plane Functions (CCNF) are
   selected to process future requests from the device.  No resource
   reservation occurs at this stage.  Later on, a particular application
   is started on the device.  Using a slice ID associated with the
   application, the device requests from the network the establishment
   of flows for this application.  For example, this slice ID can be
   associated to the application by the application service provider.
   This slice ID is used by the network to select the actual RAN slice
   and core network slice that will host user and control plane flows
   and network functions.  In the user plane, network resource
   reservation (in term of KPIs such as maximum throughput, delay, etc.)
   is applied at the individual application flow level (e.g. at the PDU
   Session level in 3GPP terms).  In the control plane, resource
   reservation can be performed in a less granular fashion, e.g.
   reservation may occur once for a given slice.  During the lifetime of
   a device connection to a network, application flows will be
   established and maintained through a given set of common control
   plane function (CCNF), which may rarely change.  In general, a single
   device and a single CCNF will therefore interoperate with multiple
   slices simultaneously (e.g. a broadband and a Tactile Internet
   slice).

5.  Role of NFV in Network slicing

   Virtualization is a key enabler of network slices; Many network
   services can be easily deployed using components of NFV framework
   like network functions, hardware decoupling and resource placement
   [#?NFVSLICE].  When deployed as a network slice, the resources
   associated with virtualized network services are managed uniformly by
   infrastructure provider.  One such use case is described below.

5.1.  Virtualized Customer Premise Equipment

5.1.1.  Traditional Customer premise equipments(CPEs)

   A CPE is an equipment that connects the customer premises to the
   provider's network.  A CPE may either be a layer-2 or a layer-3
   device (the routing gateway) performing different network functions
   depending on the access technology (DSL modem, PON modem, etc.).  Any

   services provided such as Internet access, IPTV, VoIP, etc. or
   network functions for example, local NAT, local DHCP, IGMP proxy-
   routing, PPP sessions, routing, etc. are also part of CPE.  The
   installation of different on premise devices, entails a high cost for
   service providers in terms of both initial installation and
   operational support, since they are typically responsible for the
   end-to-end service.

                  Figure 4: Traditional CPE architecture

   Traditional CPE deployments are shown in figure Figure 4.  These are
   service provider network functions installed on customer site to
   provide above mentioned functionalities along with remote site
   connectivity.  Communication Service provider (CSP) is responsible
   for management and administration of connections and state with
   proper policy, bandwidth, security and QoS requirements.

5.1.2.  Trends in CPE infrastructure

   A virtualized CPE architecture moves several network functions from
   on premise to the service provider network to facilitate provisioning
   of new services to customers based on a lean CPE functions on
   premises such as minimizing number of network functions on customer
   premises, perhaps only layer-2 visibility among them with no need for
   routing gateways in the home network is suppressed.  Several routing,
   NAT, firewall capabilities may be performed in the service provider's
   cloud.  A customer's site is highly simplified with vCPE solution,
   perhaps requiring only access level connectivity on premise and
   moving other network functions to ISP's cloud.

   A vCPE when combined with SD-WAN technology provides service
   guarantees for different enterprise applications and with a
   generalized sliced approach, the solution can be customized on per
   enterprise basis using a standard approach to delivery of WAN
   solutions to multiple enterprises.

          Figure 5: irtualized CPE, with distributed architecture

   Figure 5 shows a virtualized architecture in which many functions are
   moved to CSP's cloud simplifying CPE on premises tremendously.
   Additional details of deployment architecture models are captured in
   [I-D.pularikkal-virtual-cpe] where full dissemination of data path
   and control plane functions is described.  The figure shows vCPEx,
   vCPEy, vCPEz are virtualized CPEs on multiple sites of a specific
   customer, there may be set of different network functions in each x,
   y and z CPE.  The vCPE instance in CSP cloud is integrated to each
   site performing service chains of network functions and resource
   allocations specific for ingress and egress path of each site.

5.1.2.1.  Challenges

   A vCPE is a well-known concept[VCPEBBF] which when combined with WAN
   technologies provides end to end visibility and reachability to
   remote sites.  It has been solved using network function
   virtualization (NFV) approaches and via offload of compute intensive
   functions to the CSP cloud for ease of management by CSP.  However,
   there is no standard approach to connectivity or management of
   various CPE functions.  Furthermore, it is highly desirable for
   customers to control and monitor their own network resources at both
   remote and local sites.  Using network slicing, a greater level of
   agility can be achieved, with each customer dynamically managing its
   own network with the assistance of network slicing framework.

5.1.3.  vCPE as a network slice

   The benefit of self-managing a vCPE network slice is the capability
   to move network functions on premise of to the cloud.  An obvious use
   case will be customer initiated gradual migration of network
   functions from a site to CSP cloud.

                     Figure 6: vCPE as a Network Slice

   Editor's Note: TODO: here we have inconsistencies between the drafts
   and more importantly with the 3GPPP and TM forum.

   In Figure 6, a slice for vCPE is shown.  Using slice subnet approach,
   each vCPE site instance may be considered as an abstracted subnet,
   along with the WAN transport as another subnet.  The network
   functions are chained in a distributed fashion between site vCPEs and
   CSP vCPE subnet.  A monitoring function interfaces with CSP's global
   slice manager for resource management.  A south-bound interface
   through network slice transport protocol, realizes these functions on
   the infrastructure.

5.1.3.1.  Required Characteristics

   Having a dedicated sliced network catering to dynamic customization
   of network functions with guaranteed resource method, simplifies
   network operations.  In case of such vCPE type solutions, it is
   common for each customer to have its own private IP address space,
   therefore, the resource isolation must include address isolations as
   well.  This may be achieved based on existing label techniques or
   through new network slicing data path protocol.  Using NSaaS

   characteristics, network customization allows a tenants vCPE slice to
   place and manage NFs either from cloud or on-premise.  While, the
   guarantees in connectivity through SD-WAN transport aligns with
   strict resource demand characteristic.

6.  Services with Resource Assurance

6.1.  Enhanced Broadband

   Today, video consumes the largest amount of bandwidth over the
   Internet.  As the higher resolution formats enter mainstream, even
   more bandwidth will be needed to stream 4K/8K/360 degree formats.
   The scenario in this section are discussed in regards to need for
   demands beyond best-effort network delivery, in particular
   requirements due to growth in data rate capacity, connection density
   and interactive media.  These are equally applicable to both fixed

6.1.1.  Media delivery networks

           Figure 7: Traditional Streaming Media Infrastructure

6.1.2.  Enhanced Media Streaming Description

   Today the video output format is HD with 1080p resolution with few
   services delivering up to 4K.  Both Video-on-demand and live-linear
   channels (streaming live event feed) can be supported.

6.1.2.1.  Factors Influencing Enhanced Broadband Use Cases

   Different service components of media delivery are shown in Figure 7
   above and often an overlay or OTT infrastructure is used.  A MBB
   service deployment requires acquiring content, transcoders and CDN
   servers and decoders (DASH, HLS, HDS etc) to support different
   delivery formats to different types of terminals.  These can be
   viewed as specialized service functions in media streaming
   infrastructure.  In the current form, the entire operation is (a) not



Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   flexible in terms of resources placement (on premise vs cloud vs
   proximity to destination), (b) is built on best-effort network of
   what's available resources, (c) Is slow in reactinf to network
   congestion leading to client-server based end to end stream
   optimizations derived from network conditions.

6.1.2.2.  Traditional Media Streaming Service Verticals

   Another variation to media streaming is differentiation of resource
   requirements for different kinds of service deliveries.  There are at
   least 3 different categories of media or content distribution:

   (1)  Video on Demand (VOD)

   (2)  Live streaming/Linear channels

   (3)  Video conferencing

   While (1) and (1) are one way content consumption, video conferencing
   requires 2-way or multi-way connection.  It may consist of either
   person-person or person-group video communication. while buffering is
   feasible for VoD, realtime/live feeds need no buffers, avoid
   restransmissions and expect lower latency.

6.1.2.3.  New Verticals - Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR)

   Virtual Reality(VR)/Augmented Reality(AR) is the future use case of
   eMBB services.  A 360-degree video in comparison is a lower
   resolution, requiring ~25 Mbps network bandwidth for streaming.  For
   a network based AR/VR bandwidth required will be in the order of Gbps
   and latency less than 10 milliseconds for a fully immersive
   experience such as cloud-based VR gaming, fully-interactive media
   experience.  Notably, media processing for AR/VR will remain same as
   in-network processing functions as shown in Figure 7 and high
   latencies between components could lead to downgrade of user
   experience.  Therefore, an AR/VR stream requires a special
   infrastructure that differs from best-effort network.

6.1.3.  eMBB Type Slices

   A purpose-built network slice for eMBB streaming shall ensure to
   minimize processing overheads, it may be done by placement of network
   functions closer to subscribers.

   o  Resource scaling: eMBB resources should be allocated dynamically
      because bandwidth is expensive and requirements are high, such
      vertical service operators may not want to pay for unutilized




Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


      bandwidth.  Therefore, slices should be able to negotiate and
      adjust the scale for both bandwidth and service functions.

   o  Transport resource constraints are different for the fan-out
      network between user and distribution network; and content
      acquisition to distribution network.

   o  Latency guarantees vary for live streaming, on-demand streaming
      and connected AR/VR streaming.

   See Figure 8 above for a reference slice.

6.1.4.  Required Characteristics

   A typical eMBB slice from a network operator is performance oriented
   service customization.  An eMBB service slice template will allow a
   tenant to request or specify 1.  CDN components (as service
   functions) - Regional network locations of CDN , encoders etc.  -
   Location of acquired content.  - Describes transport constraints for
   its own distribution network comprising of connectivity between
   content acquisition and Fan-out points.  2.  A granularity of
   transport resource scaling.  3.  An interface to subscriber database
   from multiple access network types (cellular, fixed).  4.  Live
   performance monitoring - Through interface to network slice resource
   monitoring and negotiation loop.  - A well-coordinated network slice
   protocol that enables resource allocation across different network
   domains.

   Note in addition to eMBB, traditional CDN use cases can be deployed
   in a slice as well, see examples in [RFC6770].

           6.Decided Behavior

              Figure 10: Workflow of wireless sensor network

   As Figure 10 shows, sensors mainly collect data & behavior; rarely
   communicate with each other in traditional wireless sensor network.
   While in the scenarios discussed in this section, sensors or embedded
   devices will be more intelligent and carry out more frequent
   interactions that raises more challenges for mobile networks.

6.2.2.  Massive Internet of Things Description

   Machine-to-machine type communication will dominate communication
   paradigm in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing,
   transportation, etc.  In order to support the massive internet of
   things, traditional mobile networks have to be redefined -- by
   creating the connectivity fabric for everything and bringing new
   levels of on-device intelligence.

6.2.2.1.  Factors Influencing Massive Internet of Things Use Cases

   There are three main challenges raised by Massive Internet of Things
   use cases:

   o  Scalable connectivity: there will be billions of smart devices
      connect to mobile networks worldwide by 2020;




Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   o  Wide area coverage: sensor could be embedded into various
      household equipments, medical instruments, vehicles, or even
      public facilities;

   o  Frequent small amount data transmission: due to limited power,
      most of the embedded sensors work intermittently rather than
      continuously.

6.2.2.2.  New Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) Verticals

   A few examples of new types of scenarios that require unique
   infrastructure are mentioned below.

6.2.2.2.1.  Smart City

   Smart city networks is an integration of several public
   infrastructures together through M2M communications.  For example

   o  Automatic metering for gas, energy, water, etc;

   o  Environment monitoring for pollution, temperature, humidity, etc;

   o  Light management inside buildings or even the whole city;

   o  Traffic signal control;

   o  Public safety alerting for natural disaster.

   Building a smart city requires a variety of IoT networks to inter-
   operate together; these IoT networks are run by different departments
   with different access privileges for administration and access
   control.  A smart-city network should be isolated from the public
   Internet.

6.2.2.2.2.  E-Health

   E-health refers to the application that remote monitor the physical
   conditions (e.g., heart rate, pulse, blood pressure etc.), and
   accordingly take necessary medical measures remotely.  Being a life-
   critical service, e-health communication network must be reliable and
   fast but small-size of data exchange.  In addition, the privacy and
   security of user's data must be guaranteed.

6.2.3.  mMTC Type Slices

   mMTC involves potentially a large number of small and power-
   constrained devices, therefore, resource allocation at scale is of
   particular importance in mMTC type slices.  Furthermore, different



Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   kind of IoT devices may exhibit quite different traffic patterns
   e.g., continuous (heart rate monitors) & periodic delay tolerant
   (temperature sensors), delay sensitive (e.g., weather forecast &
   disaster alerting), mobility mode, security awareness etc.  The mMTC
   type slices should be conscious of various requirements of scale,
   data pattern, reliability, security and energy efficient
   communications.

6.2.4.  Required Characteristics

   Different from eMBB and uRLLC type services, mMTC service does not
   have so much strict requirements on bandwidth and latency.  Massive
   and ubiquitous connectivity support would become the biggest
   challenge of mMTC service.  That is, for an network operator, mMTC is
   mainly concentrated in the access network side and most of the
   information flow should not pass through the transmission or core
   network, both for security and communication efficiency.  The
   mobility management IoT gateway functions could be placed closer to
   terminals (e.g., base-stations, edge clouds, etc.).  Consequently, an
   mMTC type slice should consist of plentiful access network resource,
   as well as normal yet reliable transmission network and core network
   resources in general.

6.3.  Ultra-reliable low latency communication

6.3.1.  Brief introduction

   Not only, mission critical communication services but industrial
   manufacturing, production processes, remote medical surgery, and
   transportation safety (high mobility cases), etc scenarios require
   ultra-reliable communications with no packet loss.

6.3.2.  Challenges

   In uRLLC scenarios, both data and control planes may require
   significant enhancements to transmission or information distribution
   protocols.  [TR_3GPP_38.913] specifies generic KPIs for access
   network user plane latency as 1ms and reliability factor of 99.999%
   for transmission of a packet of size 32 bytes.  Although KPIs vary
   for different scenarios such as V2X(3-10ms, 99.999%), eMBB (4ms UL/DL
   each), In order to meet these, latency and reliability of the
   transport in mobile networks should also be considered.

6.3.3.  New service verticals

   In the following sections three new uRLLC scenarios are described.

6.3.3.1.  Industrial Operation and Inspection

   Operations in remote industry sites usually need the support of
   mobile transport network.  Accurately operating machinery (low
   latency and jitter) from remote locations requires high-quality
   communication links between the control site.  Factors to consider *
   low latency and low jtter in communication path * Short time interval
   between an operator sending control signal tp equipment response.

   In an industrial closed control loop (Sensor -Controller - Actuator)
   as shown in figure Figure 11, a typical control cycle time where
   network is involved should be below 10ms [White-paper-5GAA].

6.3.3.2.  Remote Surgery

   Remote surgery which enables surgeons to perform critical specialized
   medical procedures remotely, allowing their vital expertise to be
   applied globally.  Providing accurate control and feedback for the
   surgeon entails very strict requirements in terms of latency,
   reliability and security.

6.3.3.3.  Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X)

   Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) network uses precise knowledge of the
   traffic situation across the entire road/highway network to optimize
   traffic flows, reduce congestion, and minimize accidents.  For uRLLC
   scenario,

   o  V2X in access network uses Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) type
      protocols for vehicle-to-vehicle and an access medium
      communication (either ITS-band or commercial-cellular).  The
      topologies are dynamic and mobility is high.  In order to support
      fully autonomous reliable driving, a highly reliable communication
      channel is required.




Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   o  Often, V2X may involve a part transport and core networks for
      functions such as subscriber/vehicle admission and intensive
      computational resource for aggregating information from multiple
      traffic zones.

6.3.4.  Required Characteristics

   A uRLLC network slice only accepts service specifc traffic and
   discards any other type of traffic to avoid negative impact on uRLLC
   service operation.  Even within the same vertical different kind of
   services should be isolated.  For example, in the V2X vertical, the
   network slice used for autonomous driving should not be used for in-
   vehicle infotainment.  Capabilities required by uRLLC service
   provider include

   o  Locations of the access nodes for terminals (devices, vehicles) to
      the transport network and locations of the controller to construct
      its own network topology within the network slice.  In high
      mobility scenario such as automotive verticals, the dynamic
      topology adjustments are required without loss of data.

   o  Each service vertical has different performance requirements in
      terms of latency, reliability and data rate etc., therefore, the
      uRLLC network slice should allow customization for these
      parameters.

   o  A uRLLC service provider should be able to registers self with
      access rights to resource monitoring and negotiation loop.

   From a network operator provides a uRLLC Slice with following
   considerations

   o  Should support/provide specific data and control planes protocols
      with significant enhancements for deterministic latency and
      reliability (e.g.  DetNet[I-D.dt-detnet-dp-sol] in data plane).

   o  Allow uRLLC provider to access user admission and authentication
      to its network slice in advance.

   o  The network coverage for a uRLLC service provisioning may be
      limited to a confined area, either indoor or outdoor, network
      operator needs to be able to coordinate resource allocation across
      different access types and network domains.

   The Figure 12, shows provider and operator view of the network.  The
   monitoring of resources is done in the context of performance.  A
   performance degradation would require resource adjustment.  As shown
   in Figure 12, in one possible sliced model will have its own

   customizer that uses internal performance observing logic with in its

6.4.  Critical Communications

   Critical communications are associated with emergency situations.
   Often referred to as mission critical, the communication has to be
   reliable and non-disruptive.  Different scenarios of critical
   communications relate to public safety responders (e.g. firefighters,
   paramedics), military, utility or commercial applications, mainly



Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   using reliable voice or short data messaging over wireless
   communication systems.

6.4.1.  Enhanced Public Safety Infrastructure

   Traditional technologies for emergency communications are narrow band
   radio networks such as Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems.  Related
   systems such as [TETRA] or [P25] have dedicated frequencies and
   channels assigned to individual groups of users for instant voice or
   short messaging connection with a simple interface.  Next-generation
   public safety communications are planned to be built with enhanced
   broadband voice, data and video communications services beyond
   narrowband LMR with broadband LTE networks for high speed data (ref
   22.179 and FirstNet).

6.4.1.1.  Role of Transport and Fixed Networks

   3GPP defined on-network critical communication can be established
   both - (a) over the network infrastructure to manage the call, (b)
   off-network, where the terminals communicate directly to each other.
   In slicing context, off-network is not not relevant to the topic,
   while, over the network, involves transport networks for a always
   available, reliable, and zero packet loss quality of traffic support
   to meet critical services requirements.

6.4.1.2.  Challenges for Enhanced Critical communication

   Maintaining a separate broadband infrastructure for critical
   communications incur the following challenges:

   (1)  Deployment Cost: Especially, as the coverage of this separate
        network has to be extended to large-scale nationwide geographies
        that is interoperable is not cost effective.  As new
        communication technologies emerge, public safety systems will
        have to bear the state of the art adoption cost.

   (2)  Lack of flexibility: in terms of adding new value added services
        or ability to take advantage of commercial services.

   While shared infrastructure, brings out challenges of these kind:

   (3)  Reliable support: Of basic mission critical services: Such as
        loss of information in voice communication is not acceptable in
        emergency services, if common infrastructure is to be used, it
        must assure no loss of information.

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


   (4)  Zero congestion: It is not acceptable for critical calls to be
        delayed at call setup times or be subjected to any other
        congestion scenarios.

6.4.2.  Enhanced Critical Service Type Slices

   Having the eMC (enhanced mission critical) network slices benefit
   from the following:

   o  Insertion and authorization of subscribers in a group
      communication: In a critical infrastructure, the subscriber
      authentication may be done earlier at the entry point
      automatically through slice selection functional entity.

   o  Pre-allocated QoS Class Identifiers (QCIs): Generally, QCIs are
      requested on per session basis which could slow down overall call
      control setup and is undesirable for emergency services.  When
      operating in a slice, these resources maybe reserved ahead of time
      in a coarse-grained manner instead of per session.

   eMC network slices are relatively straight forward as it only
   concerns with guaranteed bit rate (GBR) on per media basis and
   management of groups.  From transport they should be able to request
   transport services based on GBR for reliable communication.  A
   reference network slice in Figure 13 below, shows a mission critical
   (MC) organization providing service agreement through a network slice
   template with resource specification.  The eMC slice sets up
   different subnetworks of different subscriber groups and manages its
   membership.  These subnets are realized into the infrastructure
   across different domains through a network slice transport mechanism.
   The eMC must be capable of active resource monitoring to prevent
   congestions to ever occur as well as request additional transport
   resources in case of emergency event occurrence.

7.1.  ICN as a Network Slice

   ICN as in Information-Centric Networking is a culmination of multiple
   future Internet research efforts in various parts of the world, now
   being pursued under IRTF's research task group called [ICNRG].

7.1.1.  Information Centric Networks Description

   Information-Centric Networking (ICN) addresses Internet's network
   architectural design gaps based on evolving applications requirements
   and end user behavior which is significantly different from what IP
   was designed for, which was optimized for host-to-host communication
   paradigm.  ICN is a non-IP paradigm based on name-based routing and
   offers many desirable networking features to applications such as,
   caching, mobility, multicasting and computing in a manner different
   from traditional host-centric communication model.  ICN paradigm is
   aligned with the service-centric architectures enabled through
   frameworks like SDN, NFV, and Edge Computing.  At a high level, ICN
   offers a name-based abstraction to application that doesn't require
   further translation (as in domain names to IP mapping in current IP
   networking), making it suitable to several communication modalities
   such as multi-point-to-multi-point, D2D and Ad hoc communication.

7.1.1.1.  New Verticals - ICN based service delivery

   Services over ICN slices can take advantage of its features such as:

   (1)  In ICN, applications, services and content are addressed using
        names, hence end host resolution services like DNS can be
        avoided, this achieves name resolution to edge content or
        services without incurring additional RTT delays.

   (2)  Service flows will be offered mobility and multicasting support,
        as the networking is session-less and optimized towards
        efficient movement of named data or networking named services
        and host level communication.

   (3)  Services can be deployed at the very edges with ease as ICN
        routers are compute friendly, this is because states in the
        forwarding table can be that of either content or service
        resources.

   (4)  Further saving bandwidth in the upstream link through
        opportunistic caching is an inherent feature of ICN, this also
        leads to energy efficient networking.

7.1.1.2.  Considerations for ICN Applications

   When offered as a programmable and customizable logical network
   slice, ICN based services can be offered as a network slice in
   parallel with traditional IP based services.  ICN can be realized as
   a slice [_5GICN_] based on the choice of data plane resource offered
   by the operators in different domains of the network such as the
   access, core network or main data centers.  While the same resources
   can be used to support services over IP, proper resource isolation
   shall allow it to co-exist with ICN slices as well.  ICN though
   initially was aimed to serve CDN applications such as video-on-demand
   or general web content distribution, it is equally adept to server
   real-time applications such as audio/video conferencing [ICN-AV], AR/
   VR applications, or IoT services.  ICN slices can be offered over a
   network slicing framework built upon a programmable pool of software
   and/or hardware based data plane resources.  Heterogeneous mix of
   pool of infrastructure resourcesis possible such as : Hardware
   decoupled network functions as in containers or VMs.  Deeply
   programmable hardware resources include GPU, FPGAs [ClickNP], Smart
   NIC [Netronome] operated using P4 abstractions, that are supported
   over x-86 platform.  Programmable hardware may also include
   commercial chips supported using P4 or POF allowing one to realize
   high performing novel data planes, e.g.  [Barefoot]

7.1.2.  ICN Type Slices Asks

   In ICN, applications use Interest/Data abstractions over named
   resources resolved by ICN's routing plane.  An ICN slice shall be a
   programmable ICN-domain, in which content learning and distribution
   will be done using existing or new ICN aware routing and data plane
   protocols.  As a result, it should be possible to deploy network
   functions such as ICN routers and content producers and distributors
   that serve and speak ICN protocols.  Just as multiple service
   instances can be part of a slice, an ICN slices can multiplex
   heterogeneous services; on the other hand an ICN slice can be as
   granular as a service instance too.  The latter approach has
   implications with respect to consumer privacy, access control of name
   data objects, and granularity of mobility handling.

7.1.3.  Required Characteristics

   A basic ICN slice can be manifested as a resource isolated logical
   network while sharing resources with other connectivity or service
   slices.  An ICN slice relies on programmability and virtualization
   framework to manage the service slices, to allow maximum flexibility
   through ICN aware logically centralized control plane for icn service
   and slice management.

   o  Through a network slice template -ICN service providing entity
      could specify specific locations (edge of network domains) to
      deploy ICN-routers or other ICN-NFs (ICN aware network functions).
      Its service definition varies with the type of service, for e.g.
      in case of a VoD service, it can include the demand with respect
      user popularity distribution for a particular set of content,
      distributed cache or storage resource, and compute resources to
      execute video-centric service functions.

   o  An ability to establish connectivity between ICN network elements
      in all segments and create an ICN based virtual topology.  This
      can be done using specific service control plane based on
      application events arriving in a dynamic manner.

   o  Mechanism to carry ICN user traffic over the infrastructure, ICN
      slice can be made aware to the RAN explicitly by integrating ICN
      NF with the eNodeB or implicitly using traffic classification
      function at the edge and tunneled to ICN user plane functin (UPF)
      or can be enabled in an overlay manner.  The close the ICN network
      is to the UE, better will be the affect on overall efficiency in
      terms of bandwidth, latency and energy consumption.

   o  In addition, bandwidth and other network resources may be
      requested from the underlay depending on its capability of
      providing deterministic or statisticaly guarnatees.

   How multiple services will be deployed within an ICN aware slice may
   or may not be exposed to the network operator, depending on if the
   ICN slices are natively managed by it or a by other service
   providers.

7.2.  Network Slices in Communication Endpoints

   In this section connected endpoint use case are described to
   highlight significance of slicing in an end point.

7.2.1.  Connected Vehicle

   Connected vehicles are example of scenarios where a communication end
   point is split into 3 different type of services that vary in in
   terms of topology, bandwidth, latency, mobility and security.

   a  V2I in short-range: requires ad hoc routing protocol, reliable
      data plane and higher layer security and authentication;

   b  Traditional broadband for Infotainment: requires high speed
      connection bandwidth.

   c  In network assistance for localized services: low speed, reliable
      connection for a short period of time.  This service need to be
      highly secure and isolated because it connects vehicle to
      manufacturers who can alter component settings.

7.2.2.  Sliced Terminal

   A terminal, if authorized may be allocated dedicated resource for
   mission critical services and best-effort slice for normal
   connectivity.

7.2.3.  Required Characteristics

   A network operator that registers a subscriber is required to know
   how a terminal is used and which services, offered as a slice it is
   part of.  A highly secure 3-way authentication between an operator,
   service provider and terminal is required to enable a slice on a
   device.

8.  Overall Use case Analysis

   The discussion in above use cases can be summarized as following in
   terms of the requirements for network slicing framework.

8.1.  Requirements Reference

   The following functional requirements are derived from discussions in
   above sections.  They are described in details in
   [I-D.qiang-netslices-gap-analysis] document:

   o  Req.1 Network Slicing Resource Specification

   o  Req.2 Cross-Network Segment & Cross-Domain Negotiation

   o  Req.3 Guaranteed Slice Performance and Isolation

   o  Req.4 OAM Operations with Customized Granularity

   The differentiated services described in this document are in the
   context of sharing common network infrastructure.  They also
   demonstrate several common functionalities.  Therefore, a homogenous
   approach towards deployment and management is absolutely necessary.

8.2.  Mapping Common characteristics to Requirements

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


8.2.1.  Req.1 Network Slicing Resource Specification

   (1)  Resource Reservation: compute and network resources are reserved
        as part of initial creation and subsequent maintenance of a
        slice.  For example, a service may initially reserve resources
        for its own control plane, and then later it may reserve user
        plane flows for applications on demand.  Reference use cases:
        Differentiated services discussed in section "Services with
        Resource Assurance".

   (2)  Transparency: Network slicing does not change the functionality
        of a scenario; It only facilitates creation of an isolated, an
        independently run infrastructure for that use case over a common
        network.  Transparency promotes inter-operability and a common
        resource specification enables it.

   (3)  Multi-access knowledge: Many services are scoped within an
        access domain that could be either fixed, wireless or cellular
        network.  Each network domain has different characteristics, for
        example, it may use layer-2, layer-3 or MPLS connectivity or
        radio network.  Dissemination of normalized resource
        characteristics should be done uniformly across all domains to
        simplify slice deployment.

   (4)  Multi-dimensional service vertical: Network slicing supports
        dynamic multi-services, multi-tenancy and the means for backing
        vertical market players.

8.2.2.  Req.2 Cross-Domain Coordination

   (1)  Multi-domain coordination: Multi-domain refers to different
        technology related network domains.  For example, it may be RAN,
        DSL etc, mobile core network, ISP or different domains in
        transport networks such as carrier ethernet, MPLS, TE-tunnel
        etc.  Often, they are under same administrator's control but may
        require coordination across different administration.  All
        scenarios mentioned require multi-domain coordination to connect
        and administer different subnets.

   (2)  Automated Network Slice Management: Network slicing would need
        to be self-managed with automated deployment in order to cope
        with scalability.

   (3)  Resource Assurance: All resource centric scenarios require on-
        demand and dynamic adjustments.  It may not be possible to
        achieve this using centralize or API approach with fine
        granualrity of resources participating in constrained path
        computation.  It can also be difficult to coordinate across



Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


        different domains.  Therefore, a network slice transport
        protocol that standardizes resource propagation in different
        subnets is needed.  It is important for protocol (or interface)
        to be lightweight and distributed.

8.2.3.  Req.3 Guaranteed Slice Performance and Isolation

   (1)  Performance Isolation: resource or traffic congestion in a slice
        should not affect traffic on other slices sharing the same
        infrastructure.

   (2)  Secure Isolation: network services hosted on a slice should not
        be able to breach into other slices deployed over the same
        infrastructure, e.g. a network function should not be able to
        intercept or inject traffic on another slice it is not connected
        to.

   (3)  Operational Isolation: Each network slice may have its own
        operator that sees this slice as a complete network (i.e router
        instances, programmability, using any appropriate communication
        protocol, caches, provide dynamic placement of virtual network
        functions according to traffic patterns, to use its own
        controller, finally it can manage its network as its own).

   (4)  Reliability: It is an important resource attribute in the type
        of service verticals described above.  Many services verticals
        cannot deliver functionality unless the network is reliable (See
        remote industry operation, remote surgery and other uRLLC
        applications).

   (5)  Function Sharing: a given physical or virtual function or
        possibly slice subnet may be interconnected with more than one
        slice simultaneously.  Examples include a client device or, in
        3GPP systems, the AMF.  An auto discovery of such attributes is
        necessary as an exception to isolation.

   (6)  Slice identification: It is needed to uniquely specify and
        resolve resources and for slice-lifecycle in management plane.
        In control and data plane identification isolates and secures
        resources among the slices.

8.2.4.  Req.4 OAM Operations with Customized Granularity

   (1)  Independent per slice management plane: Since a sliced network
        is purpose-built, the intelligence to run, control, manage,
        operate and administer a slice is with the provider of service
        in a slice.

8.4.  Other Challenges and Considerations

   These observations impose several challenges on network transport.

   (1)  Within each domain it should be permissible to deploy different
        traffic engineering techniques, for example, FlexE, MPLS, RSVP-
        TE, DETNET or SDN based TE.

   (2)  Within each domain different transport techniques may be
        deployed, for example L2 or L3 virtual networks such as VLAN,



Makhijani, et al.        Expires January 2, 2018               [Page 38]

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                   July 2017


        GUE, VxLAN, etc. or Software Function Chaining (SFC) such as
        NSH.

   (3)  No two network infrastructures are alike, technologies such as,
        edge computing, NFV, SDN, cloud are partially deployed today.
        There is no assumption about whether a service is available as a
        physical node or a virtual node.

   (4)  Optimal placement of resources on-demand is only possible when
        infrastructure supports it.  A capability exposure of a domain
        could facilitate such functions.

   (5)  At a massive scale, it is extremely complex to centralize global
        view of resources and be able to monitor and distribute on-
        demand.  Incorporating domain-to-domain communication about data
        and control for a specific network slice shall be considered.

   The challenge lies in stitching end to end slice monitoring and
   customization through above described multi-dimensional heterogenity.

   Network operators would exploit network slicing for:

   o  Significantly reducing operational expenditures, allowing
      programmability necessary to enrich the offered tailored services.

   o  Providing the means for network programmability

   o  Additional business offerings to OTT and other vertical market
      players without changing the physical infrastructure (i.e.  Health
      Vertical Sector, Energy Vertical Sector, Automotive Vertical
      Sector, Media and Entertainment Vertical Sector, Factory-of-the-
      Future Vertical Sector, Smart Home Vertical Sector, Smart City
      Vertical Sector, Additional Specialized Services Vertical Sector.

9.  Conclusion

   A service should typically need a network slice for one of those
   reasons:

   (1)  The service cannot provide optimal experience on a best-effort
        network.

   (2)  It is inefficient and expensive to build a separate
        infrastructure.

   The separation from a generalized network, should allow new services
   to use newer or different protocols in network, transport and
   management layer/plane for that service (as in the case of ICN, mMTC,

   uRLL).  The goal of Network slices is to offer enriched service
   verticals with very different network capability and performance
   demands but also simplify from the traditional service delivery
   models.

   There is need for a uniform framework for end to end network slicing
   specifications that spans across multiple technology domains and can
   drive extensions in those technolgy-areas for support of Network
   slices.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations apply to each kind of slice.  In addition
   general security considerations of underlying infrastructure whether
   isolated communication with in a slice apply for links using wireless
   technologies.

11.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions requested at this time.
