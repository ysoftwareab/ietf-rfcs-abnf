  <p class="title">HTTP/1.1, part 1: URIs, Connections, and Message Parsing<br />
  <span class="filename">draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-14</span></p>
  
  <h1 id="rfc.abstract"><a href="#rfc.abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document is Part 1 of the seven-part specification that defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together, obsoletes RFC 2616.  Part 1 provides an overview of HTTP and its associated terminology, defines the "http" and "https" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the generic message syntax and parsing requirements for HTTP message frames, and describes general security concerns for implementations.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and MIME-like message payloads for flexible interaction with network-based hypertext information systems. HTTP relies upon the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) standard <a href="#RFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> to indicate the target resource and relationships between resources.  Messages are passed in a format similar to that used by Internet mail <a href="#RFC5322">[RFC5322]</a> and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) <a href="#RFC2045">[RFC2045]</a> (see Appendix A of <a href="#Part3">[Part3]</a> for the differences between HTTP and MIME messages).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">HTTP is a generic interface protocol for information systems. It is designed to hide the details of how a service is implemented by presenting a uniform interface to clients that is independent of the types of resources provided. Likewise, servers do not need to be aware of each client's purpose: an HTTP request can be considered in isolation rather than being associated with a specific type of client or a predetermined sequence of application steps. The result is a protocol that can be used effectively in many different contexts and for which implementations can evolve independently over time.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">HTTP is also designed for use as an intermediation protocol for translating communication to and from non-HTTP information systems.  HTTP proxies and gateways can provide access to alternative information services by translating their diverse protocols into a hypertext format that can be viewed and manipulated by clients in the same way as HTTP services.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">One consequence of HTTP flexibility is that the protocol cannot be defined in terms of what occurs behind the interface. Instead, we are limited to defining the syntax of communication, the intent of received communication, and the expected behavior of recipients.  If the communication is considered in isolation, then successful actions ought to be reflected in corresponding changes to the observable interface provided by servers. However, since multiple clients might act in parallel and perhaps at cross-purposes, we cannot require that such changes be observable beyond the scope of a single response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document is Part 1 of the seven-part specification of HTTP, defining the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1", obsoleting <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a> and <a href="#RFC2145">[RFC2145]</a>.  Part 1 describes the architectural elements that are used or referred to in HTTP, defines the "http" and "https" URI schemes, describes overall network operation and connection management, and defines HTTP message framing and forwarding requirements.  Our goal is to define all of the mechanisms necessary for HTTP message handling that are independent of message semantics, thereby defining the complete set of requirements for message parsers and message-forwarding intermediaries.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.1.p.2">A construct "#" is defined, similar to "*", for defining comma-delimited lists of elements. The full form is "&lt;n&gt;#&lt;m&gt;element" indicating at least &lt;n&gt; and at most &lt;m&gt; elements, each separated by a single comma (",") and optional whitespace (OWS, <a href="#basic.rules">Section 1.2.2</a>).  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.1.p.3">For compatibility with legacy list rules, recipients SHOULD accept empty list elements. In other words, consumers would follow the list productions: </p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.4"></div>
<pre>
  #element =&gt; [ ( "," / element ) *( OWS "," [ OWS element ] ) ]
  
  1#element =&gt; *( "," OWS ) element *( OWS "," [ OWS element ] )

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.1.p.4">Note that empty elements do not contribute to the count of elements present, though.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.2.p.2">This specification uses three rules to denote the use of linear whitespace: OWS (optional whitespace), RWS (required whitespace), and BWS ("bad" whitespace).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.2.p.3">The OWS rule is used where zero or more linear whitespace octets might appear. OWS SHOULD either not be produced or be produced as a single SP.

<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">HTTP enables the use of intermediaries to satisfy requests through a chain of connections.  There are three common forms of HTTP intermediary: proxy, gateway, and tunnel.  In some cases, a single intermediary might act as an origin server, proxy, gateway, or tunnel, switching behavior based on the nature of each request.  </p>

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">The figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the user agent and origin server. A request or response message that travels the whole chain will pass through four separate connections.  Some HTTP communication options might apply only to the connection with the nearest, non-tunnel neighbor, only to the end-points of the chain, or to all connections along the chain. Although the diagram is linear, each participant might be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications. For example, B might be receiving requests from many clients other than A, and/or forwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time that it is handling A's request.  </p>
<p><a name="index.upstream"></a><a name="index.downstream"></a> <a name="index.inbound"></a><a name="index.outbound"></a> We use the terms "upstream" and "downstream" to describe various requirements in relation to the directional flow of a message: all messages flow from upstream to downstream.  Likewise, we use the terms inbound and outbound to refer to directions in relation to the request path: "inbound" means toward the origin server and "outbound" means toward the user agent.  </p>
<p><a name="index.proxy"></a> A "proxy" is a message forwarding agent that is selected by the client, usually via local configuration rules, to receive requests for some type(s) of absolute URI and attempt to satisfy those requests via translation through the HTTP interface.  Some translations are minimal, such as for proxy requests for "http" URIs, whereas other requests might require translation to and from entirely different application-layer protocols. Proxies are often used to group an organization's HTTP requests through a common intermediary for the sake of security, annotation services, or shared caching.  </p>
<p><a name="index.transforming%20proxy"></a> <a name="index.non-transforming%20proxy"></a> An HTTP-to-HTTP proxy is called a "transforming proxy" if it is designed or configured to modify request or response messages in a semantically meaningful way (i.e., modifications, beyond those required by normal HTTP processing, that change the message in a way that would be significant to the original sender or potentially significant to downstream recipients).  For example, a transforming proxy might be acting as a shared annotation server (modifying responses to include references to a local annotation database), a malware filter, a format transcoder, or an intranet-to-Internet privacy filter.  Such transformations are presumed to be desired by the client (or client organization) that selected the proxy and are beyond the scope of this specification.  However, when a proxy is not intended to transform a given message, we use the term "non-transforming proxy" to target requirements that preserve HTTP message semantics.  </p>
<p><a name="index.gateway"></a><a name="index.reverse%20proxy"></a> <a name="index.accelerator"></a> A "gateway" (a.k.a., "reverse proxy") is a receiving agent that acts as a layer above some other server(s) and translates the received requests to the underlying server's protocol.  Gateways are often used to encapsulate legacy or untrusted information services, to improve server performance through "accelerator" caching, and to enable partitioning or load-balancing of HTTP services across multiple machines.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.7">A gateway behaves as an origin server on its outbound connection and as a user agent on its inbound connection.  All HTTP requirements applicable to an origin server also apply to the outbound communication of a gateway.  A gateway communicates with inbound servers using any protocol that it desires, including private extensions to HTTP that are outside the scope of this specification.  However, an HTTP-to-HTTP gateway that wishes to interoperate with third-party HTTP servers MUST comply with HTTP user agent requirements on the gateway's inbound connection and MUST implement the Connection (<a href="#header.connection">Section 9.1</a>) and Via (<a href="#header.via">Section 9.9</a>) header fields for both connections.  </p>
<p><a name="index.tunnel"></a> A "tunnel" acts as a blind relay between two connections without changing the messages. Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel might have been initiated by an HTTP request. A tunnel ceases to exist when both ends of the relayed connection are closed. Tunnels are used to extend a virtual connection through an intermediary, such as when transport-layer security is used to establish private communication through a shared firewall proxy.  </p>
<p><a name="index.interception%20proxy"></a><a name="index.transparent%20proxy"></a> <a name="index.captive%20portal"></a> In addition, there may exist network intermediaries that are not considered part of the HTTP communication but nevertheless act as filters or redirecting agents (usually violating HTTP semantics, causing security problems, and otherwise making a mess of things).  Such a network intermediary, often referred to as an "interception proxy" <a href="#RFC3040">[RFC3040]</a>, "transparent proxy" <a href="#RFC1919">[RFC1919]</a>, or "captive portal", differs from an HTTP proxy because it has not been selected by the client.  Instead, the network intermediary redirects outgoing TCP port 80 packets (and occasionally other common port traffic) to an internal HTTP server.  Interception proxies are commonly found on public network access points, as a means of enforcing account subscription prior to allowing use of non-local Internet services, and within corporate firewalls to enforce network usage policies.  They are indistinguishable from a man-in-the-middle attack.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.2.4">2.4.</a> <a href="#caches" id="caches">Caches</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.1">A "cache" is a local store of previous response messages and the subsystem that controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion.  A cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response time and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent requests. Any client or server MAY employ a cache, though a cache cannot be used by a server while it is acting as a tunnel.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.2">The effect of a cache is that the request/response chain is shortened if one of the participants along the chain has a cached response applicable to that request. The following illustrates the resulting chain if B has a cached copy of an earlier response from O (via C) for a request which has not been cached by UA or A.  </p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.16"></div>

                  &lt;             &lt;
</pre>
<p><a name="index.cacheable"></a> A response is "cacheable" if a cache is allowed to store a copy of the response message for use in answering subsequent requests.  Even when a response is cacheable, there might be additional constraints placed by the client or by the origin server on when that cached response can be used for a particular request. HTTP requirements for cache behavior and cacheable responses are defined in Section 2 of <a href="#Part6">[Part6]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.4">There are a wide variety of architectures and configurations of caches and proxies deployed across the World Wide Web and inside large organizations. These systems include national hierarchies of proxy caches to save transoceanic bandwidth, systems that broadcast or multicast cache entries, organizations that distribute subsets of cached data via optical media, and so on.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.5">2.5.</a> <a href="#http.version" id="http.version">Protocol Versioning</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.1">HTTP uses a "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;" numbering scheme to indicate versions of the protocol. This specification defines version "1.1".  The protocol version as a whole indicates the sender's compliance with the set of requirements laid out in that version's corresponding specification of HTTP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.2">The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field in the first line of the message. HTTP-Version is case-sensitive.  </p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.17"></div>
<pre>
  HTTP-Version   = HTTP-Prot-Name "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
  HTTP-Prot-Name = %x48.54.54.50 ; "HTTP", case-sensitive 
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.3">The HTTP version number consists of two non-negative decimal integers separated by a "." (period or decimal point).  The first number ("major version") indicates the HTTP messaging syntax, whereas the second number ("minor version") indicates the highest minor version to which the sender is at least conditionally compliant and able to understand for future communication.  The minor version advertises the sender's communication capabilities even when the sender is only using a backwards-compatible subset of the protocol, thereby letting the recipient know that more advanced features can be used in response (by servers) or in future requests (by clients).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.4">When comparing HTTP versions, the numbers MUST be compared numerically rather than lexically.  For example, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is lower than HTTP/12.3.  Leading zeros MUST be ignored by recipients and MUST NOT be sent.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.5">When an HTTP/1.1 message is sent to an HTTP/1.0 recipient <a href="#RFC1945">[RFC1945]</a> or a recipient whose version is unknown, the HTTP/1.1 message is constructed such that it can be interpreted as a valid HTTP/1.0 message if all of the newer features are ignored.  This specification places recipient-version requirements on some new features so that a compliant sender will only use compatible features until it has determined, through configuration or the receipt of a message, that the recipient supports HTTP/1.1.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.6">The interpretation of an HTTP header field does not change between minor versions of the same major version, though the default behavior of a recipient in the absence of such a field can change.  Unless specified otherwise, header fields defined in HTTP/1.1 are defined for all versions of HTTP/1.x.  In particular, the Host and Connection header fields ought to be implemented by all HTTP/1.x implementations whether or not they advertise compliance with HTTP/1.1.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.7">New header fields can be defined such that, when they are understood by a recipient, they might override or enhance the interpretation of previously defined header fields.  When an implementation receives an unrecognized header field, the recipient MUST ignore that header field for local processing regardless of the message's HTTP version.  An unrecognized header field received by a proxy MUST be forwarded downstream unless the header field's field-name is listed in the message's Connection header-field (see <a href="#header.connection">Section 9.1</a>).  These requirements allow HTTP's functionality to be enhanced without requiring prior update of all compliant intermediaries.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.8">Intermediaries that process HTTP messages (i.e., all intermediaries other than those acting as a tunnel) MUST send their own HTTP-Version in forwarded messages.  In other words, they MUST NOT blindly forward the first line of an HTTP message without ensuring that the protocol version matches what the intermediary understands, and is at least conditionally compliant to, for both the receiving and sending of messages.  Forwarding an HTTP message without rewriting the HTTP-Version might result in communication errors when downstream recipients use the message sender's version to determine what features are safe to use for later communication with that sender.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.9">An HTTP client SHOULD send a request version equal to the highest version for which the client is at least conditionally compliant and whose major version is no higher than the highest version supported by the server, if this is known.  An HTTP client MUST NOT send a version for which it is not at least conditionally compliant.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.10">An HTTP client MAY send a lower request version if it is known that the server incorrectly implements the HTTP specification, but only after the client has attempted at least one normal request and determined from the response status or header fields (e.g., Server) that the server improperly handles higher request versions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.11">An HTTP server SHOULD send a response version equal to the highest version for which the server is at least conditionally compliant and whose major version is less than or equal to the one received in the request.  An HTTP server MUST NOT send a version for which it is not at least conditionally compliant.  A server MAY send a 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) response if it cannot send a response using the major version used in the client's request.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.12">An HTTP server MAY send an HTTP/1.0 response to an HTTP/1.0 request if it is known or suspected that the client incorrectly implements the HTTP specification and is incapable of correctly processing later version responses, such as when a client fails to parse the version number correctly or when an intermediary is known to blindly forward the HTTP-Version even when it doesn't comply with the given minor version of the protocol. Such protocol downgrades SHOULD NOT be performed unless triggered by specific client attributes, such as when one or more of the request header fields (e.g., User-Agent) uniquely match the values sent by a client known to be in error.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.13">The intention of HTTP's versioning design is that the major number will only be incremented if an incompatible message syntax is introduced, and that the minor number will only be incremented when changes made to the protocol have the effect of adding to the message semantics or implying additional capabilities of the sender.  However, the minor version was not incremented for the changes introduced between <a href="#RFC2068">[RFC2068]</a> and <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>, and this revision is specifically avoiding any such changes to the protocol.  </p>

The remainder of the URI, consisting of both the hierarchical path component and optional query component, serves as an identifier for a potential resource within that origin server's name space.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.3">If the host identifier is provided as an IP literal or IPv4 address, then the origin server is any listener on the indicated TCP port at that IP address. If host is a registered name, then that name is considered an indirect identifier and the recipient might use a name resolution service, such as DNS, to find the address of a listener for that host.  The host MUST NOT be empty; if an "http" URI is received with an empty host, then it MUST be rejected as invalid.  If the port subcomponent is empty or not given, then TCP port 80 is assumed (the default reserved port for WWW services).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.4">Regardless of the form of host identifier, access to that host is not implied by the mere presence of its name or address. The host might or might not exist and, even when it does exist, might or might not be running an HTTP server or listening to the indicated port. The "http" URI scheme makes use of the delegated nature of Internet names and addresses to establish a naming authority (whatever entity has the ability to place an HTTP server at that Internet name or address) and allows that authority to determine which names are valid and how they might be used.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.5">When an "http" URI is used within a context that calls for access to the indicated resource, a client MAY attempt access by resolving the host to an IP address, establishing a TCP connection to that address on the indicated port, and sending an HTTP request message to the server containing the URI's identifying data as described in <a href="#request">Section 4</a>.  If the server responds to that request with a non-interim HTTP response message, as described in <a href="#response">Section 5</a>, then that response is considered an authoritative answer to the client's request.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.6">Although HTTP is independent of the transport protocol, the "http" scheme is specific to TCP-based services because the name delegation process depends on TCP for establishing authority.  An HTTP service based on some other underlying connection protocol would presumably be identified using a different URI scheme, just as the "https" scheme (below) is used for servers that require an SSL/TLS transport layer on a connection. Other protocols might also be used to provide access to "http" identified resources &#8212; it is only the authoritative interface used for mapping the namespace that is specific to TCP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.7">The URI generic syntax for authority also includes a deprecated userinfo subcomponent (<a href="#RFC3986">[RFC3986]</a>, Section 3.2.1) for including user authentication information in the URI.  Some implementations make use of the userinfo component for internal configuration of authentication information, such as within command invocation options, configuration files, or bookmark lists, even though such usage might expose a user identifier or password.  Senders MUST NOT include a userinfo subcomponent (and its "@" delimiter) when transmitting an "http" URI in a message.  Recipients of HTTP messages that contain a URI reference SHOULD parse for the existence of userinfo and treat its presence as an error, likely indicating that the deprecated subcomponent is being used to obscure the authority for the sake of phishing attacks.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.6.2.p.2">All of the requirements listed above for the "http" scheme are also requirements for the "https" scheme, except that a default TCP port of 443 is assumed if the port subcomponent is empty or not given, and the TCP connection MUST be secured for privacy through the use of strong encryption prior to sending the first HTTP request.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.6.2.p.4">Resources made available via the "https" scheme have no shared identity with the "http" scheme even if their resource identifiers indicate the same authority (the same host listening to the same TCP port).

However, an extension to HTTP that is defined to apply to entire host domains, such as the Cookie protocol <a href="#draft-ietf-httpstate-cookie">[draft-ietf-httpstate-cookie]</a>, can allow information set by one service to impact communication with other services within a matching group of host domains.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.6.3.p.2">If the port is equal to the default port for a scheme, the normal form is to elide the port subcomponent. Likewise, an empty path component is equivalent to an absolute path of "/", so the normal form is to provide a path of "/" instead. The scheme and host are case-insensitive and normally provided in lowercase; all other components are compared in a case-sensitive manner.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">All HTTP/1.1 messages consist of a start-line followed by a sequence of octets in a format similar to the Internet Message Format <a href="#RFC5322">[RFC5322]</a>: zero or more header fields (collectively referred to as the "headers" or the "header section"), an empty line indicating the end of the header section, and an optional message-body.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">An HTTP message can either be a request from client to server or a response from server to client.  Syntactically, the two types of message differ only in the start-line, which is either a Request-Line (for requests) or a Status-Line (for responses), and in the algorithm for determining the length of the message-body (<a href="#message.body">Section 3.3</a>).  In theory, a client could receive requests and a server could receive responses, distinguishing them by their different start-line formats, but in practice servers are implemented to only expect a request (a response is interpreted as an unknown or invalid request method) and clients are implemented to only expect a response.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Implementations MUST NOT send whitespace between the start-line and the first header field. The presence of such whitespace in a request might be an attempt to trick a server into ignoring that field or processing the line after it as a new request, either of which might result in a security vulnerability if other implementations within the request chain interpret the same message differently.  Likewise, the presence of such whitespace in a response might be ignored by some clients or cause others to cease parsing.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">In the interest of robustness, servers SHOULD ignore at least one empty line received where a Request-Line is expected. In other words, if the server is reading the protocol stream at the beginning of a message and receives a CRLF first, it SHOULD ignore the CRLF.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">Some old HTTP/1.0 client implementations send an extra CRLF after a POST request as a lame workaround for some early server applications that failed to read message-body content that was not terminated by a line-ending. An HTTP/1.1 client MUST NOT preface or follow a request with an extra CRLF.  If terminating the request message-body with a line-ending is desired, then the client MUST include the terminating CRLF octets as part of the message-body length.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">When a server listening only for HTTP request messages, or processing what appears from the start-line to be an HTTP request message, receives a sequence of octets that does not match the HTTP-message grammar aside from the robustness exceptions listed above, the server MUST respond with an HTTP/1.1 400 (Bad Request) response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">The normal procedure for parsing an HTTP message is to read the start-line into a structure, read each header field into a hash table by field name until the empty line, and then use the parsed data to determine if a message-body is expected.  If a message-body has been indicated, then it is read as a stream until an amount of octets equal to the message-body length is read or the connection is closed.  Care must be taken to parse an HTTP message as a sequence of octets in an encoding that is a superset of US-ASCII.  Attempting to parse HTTP as a stream of Unicode characters in a character encoding like UTF-16 might introduce security flaws due to the differing ways that such parsers interpret invalid characters.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.5">HTTP allows the set of defined header fields to be extended without changing the protocol version (see <a href="#header.field.registration">Section 10.1</a>).  Unrecognized header fields MUST be forwarded by a proxy unless the proxy is specifically configured to block or otherwise transform such fields.  Unrecognized header fields SHOULD be ignored by other recipients.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">No whitespace is allowed between the header field name and colon.

A proxy MUST remove any such whitespace from a response message before forwarding the message downstream.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">A field value MAY be preceded by optional whitespace (OWS); a single SP is preferred. The field value does not include any leading or trailing white space: OWS occurring before the first non-whitespace octet of the field value or after the last non-whitespace octet of the field value is ignored and SHOULD be removed before further processing (as this does not change the meaning of the header field).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">The order in which header fields with differing field names are received is not significant. However, it is "good practice" to send header fields that contain control data first, such as Host on requests and Date on responses, so that implementations can decide when not to handle a message as early as possible.  A server MUST wait until the entire header section is received before interpreting a request message, since later header fields might include conditionals, authentication credentials, or deliberately misleading duplicate header fields that would impact request processing.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.5">Multiple header fields with the same field name MUST NOT be sent in a message unless the entire field value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)].  Multiple header fields with the same field name can be combined into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field value to the combined field value in order, separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same field name are received is therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field value; a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when forwarding a message.  </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>Note: The "Set-Cookie" header field as implemented in practice can occur multiple times, but does not use the list syntax, and thus cannot be combined into a single line (<a href="#draft-ietf-httpstate-cookie">[draft-ietf-httpstate-cookie]</a>).

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.7">Historically, HTTP header field values could be extended over multiple lines by preceding each extra line with at least one space or horizontal tab octet (line folding). This specification deprecates such line folding except within the message/http media type (<a href="#internet.media.type.message.http">Section 10.3.1</a>).  HTTP/1.1 senders MUST NOT produce messages that include line folding (i.e., that contain any field-content that matches the obs-fold rule) unless the message is intended for packaging within the message/http media type.  HTTP/1.1 recipients SHOULD accept line folding and replace any embedded obs-fold whitespace with a single SP prior to interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.8">Historically, HTTP has allowed field content with text in the ISO-8859-1 <a href="#ISO-8859-1">[ISO-8859-1]</a> character encoding and supported other character sets only through use of <a href="#RFC2047">[RFC2047]</a> encoding.  In practice, most HTTP header field values use only a subset of the US-ASCII character encoding <a href="#USASCII">[USASCII]</a>. Newly defined header fields SHOULD limit their field values to US-ASCII octets.  Recipients SHOULD treat other (obs-text) octets in field content as opaque data.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">When one or more transfer-codings are applied to a payload in order to form the message-body, the Transfer-Encoding header field MUST contain the list of transfer-codings applied.

This allows the request message framing algorithm to be independent of method semantics.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.7">For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with a message is dependent on both the request method and the response status code (<a href="#status.code.and.reason.phrase">Section 5.1.1</a>).  Responses to the HEAD request method never include a message-body because the associated response header fields (e.g., Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length, etc.) only indicate what their values would have been if the request method had been GET.  All 1xx (Informational), 204 (No Content), and 304 (Not Modified) responses MUST NOT include a message-body.  All other responses do include a message-body, although the body MAY be of zero length.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.8">The length of the message-body is determined by one of the following (in order of precedence): </p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Any response to a HEAD request and any response with a status code of 100-199, 204, or 304 is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields, regardless of the header fields present in the message, and thus cannot contain a message-body.  </li>
<li>If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present and the "chunked" transfer-coding (<a href="#transfer.codings">Section 6.2</a>) is the final encoding, the message-body length is determined by reading and decoding the chunked data until the transfer-coding indicates the data is complete.  <br><br> If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present in a response and the "chunked" transfer-coding is not the final encoding, the message-body length is determined by reading the connection until it is closed by the server.  If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present in a request and the "chunked" transfer-coding is not the final encoding, the message-body length cannot be determined reliably; the server MUST respond with the 400 (Bad Request) status code and then close the connection.  <br><br> If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field, the Transfer-Encoding overrides the Content-Length.  Such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request or response smuggling (bypass of security-related checks on message routing or content) and thus ought to be handled as an error.  The provided Content-Length MUST be removed, prior to forwarding the message downstream, or replaced with the real message-body length after the transfer-coding is decoded.  </li>
<li>If a message is received without Transfer-Encoding and with either multiple Content-Length header fields having differing field-values or a single Content-Length header field having an invalid value, then the message framing is invalid and MUST be treated as an error to prevent request or response smuggling.  If this is a request message, the server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code and then close the connection.  If this is a response message received by a proxy, the proxy MUST discard the received response, send a 502 (Bad Gateway) status code as its downstream response, and then close the connection.  If this is a response message received by a user-agent, it MUST be treated as an error by discarding the message and closing the connection.  </li>
<li>If a valid Content-Length header field is present without Transfer-Encoding, its decimal value defines the message-body length in octets.  If the actual number of octets sent in the message is less than the indicated Content-Length, the recipient MUST consider the message to be incomplete and treat the connection as no longer usable.  If the actual number of octets sent in the message is more than the indicated Content-Length, the recipient MUST only process the message-body up to the field value's number of octets; the remainder of the message MUST either be discarded or treated as the next message in a pipeline.  For the sake of robustness, a user-agent MAY attempt to detect and correct such an error in message framing if it is parsing the response to the last request on on a connection and the connection has been closed by the server.  </li>
<li>If this is a request message and none of the above are true, then the message-body length is zero (no message-body is present).  </li>
<li>Otherwise, this is a response message without a declared message-body length, so the message-body length is determined by the number of octets received prior to the server closing the connection.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.11">A server MAY reject a request that contains a message-body but not a Content-Length by responding with 411 (Length Required).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.12">Unless a transfer-coding other than "chunked" has been applied, a client that sends a request containing a message-body SHOULD use a valid Content-Length header field if the message-body length is known in advance, rather than the "chunked" encoding, since some existing services respond to "chunked" with a 411 (Length Required) status code even though they understand the chunked encoding.  This is typically because such services are implemented via a gateway that requires a content-length in advance of being called and the server is unable or unwilling to buffer the entire request before processing.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.13">A client that sends a request containing a message-body MUST include a valid Content-Length header field if it does not know the server will handle HTTP/1.1 (or later) requests; such knowledge can be in the form of specific user configuration or by remembering the version of a prior received response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.14">Request messages that are prematurely terminated, possibly due to a cancelled connection or a server-imposed time-out exception, MUST result in closure of the connection; sending an HTTP/1.1 error response prior to closing the connection is OPTIONAL.  Response messages that are prematurely terminated, usually by closure of the connection prior to receiving the expected number of octets or by failure to decode a transfer-encoded message-body, MUST be recorded as incomplete.

<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.1">Prior to persistent connections, a separate TCP connection was established for each request, increasing the load on HTTP servers and causing congestion on the Internet. The use of inline images and other associated data often requires a client to make multiple requests of the same server in a short amount of time. Analysis of these performance problems and results from a prototype implementation are available <a href="#Pad1995">[Pad1995]</a> <a href="#Spe">[Spe]</a>. Implementation experience and measurements of actual HTTP/1.1 implementations show good results <a href="#Nie1997">[Nie1997]</a>. Alternatives have also been explored, for example, T/TCP <a href="#Tou1998">[Tou1998]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.2">Persistent HTTP connections have a number of advantages: </p>

<ul>
<li>By opening and closing fewer TCP connections, CPU time is saved in routers and hosts (clients, servers, proxies, gateways, tunnels, or caches), and memory used for TCP protocol control blocks can be saved in hosts.  </li>
<li>HTTP requests and responses can be pipelined on a connection.  Pipelining allows a client to make multiple requests without waiting for each response, allowing a single TCP connection to be used much more efficiently, with much lower elapsed time.  </li>
<li>Network congestion is reduced by reducing the number of packets caused by TCP opens, and by allowing TCP sufficient time to determine the congestion state of the network.  </li>
<li>Latency on subsequent requests is reduced since there is no time spent in TCP's connection opening handshake.  </li>
<li>HTTP can evolve more gracefully, since errors can be reported without the penalty of closing the TCP connection. Clients using future versions of HTTP might optimistically try a new feature, but if communicating with an older server, retry with old semantics after an error is reported.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.1">Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making more connections through the same server. The use of persistent connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of this time-out for either the client or the server.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.2">When a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful close on the transport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource drain on the network.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.3">A client, server, or proxy MAY close the transport connection at any time. For example, a client might have started to send a new request at the same time that the server has decided to close the "idle" connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a request is in progress.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.4">This means that clients, servers, and proxies MUST be able to recover from asynchronous close events. Client software SHOULD reopen the transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests without user interaction so long as the request sequence is idempotent (see Section 7.1.2 of <a href="#Part2">[Part2]</a>). Non-idempotent request methods or sequences MUST NOT be automatically retried, although user agents MAY offer a human operator the choice of retrying the request(s). Confirmation by user-agent software with semantic understanding of the application MAY substitute for user confirmation. The automatic retry SHOULD NOT be repeated if the second sequence of requests fails.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.5">Servers SHOULD always respond to at least one request per connection, if at all possible. Servers SHOULD NOT  close a connection in the middle of transmitting a response, unless a network or client failure is suspected.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.6">Clients (including proxies) SHOULD limit the number of simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server (including proxies).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.7">Previous revisions of HTTP gave a specific number of connections as a ceiling, but this was found to be impractical for many applications. As a result, this specification does not mandate a particular maximum number of connections, but instead encourages clients to be conservative when opening multiple connections.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.4.p.8">In particular, while using multiple connections avoids the "head-of-line blocking" problem (whereby a request that takes significant server-side processing and/or has a large payload can block subsequent requests on the same connection), each connection used consumes server resources (sometimes significantly), and furthermore using multiple connections can cause undesirable side effects in congested networks.  </p>

Therefore, when a client sends this header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy) from which it has never seen a 100 (Continue) status code, the client SHOULD NOT wait for an indefinite period before sending the request body.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.3.p.4">Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers: </p>

<li>Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect header field with the "100-continue" expectation, an origin server MUST either respond with 100 (Continue) status code and continue to read from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status code, it MAY close the transport connection or it MAY continue to read and discard the rest of the request.

<li>An origin server SHOULD NOT  send a 100 (Continue) response if the request message does not include an Expect header field with the "100-continue" expectation, and MUST NOT send a 100 (Continue) response if such a request comes from an HTTP/1.0 (or earlier) client. There is an exception to this rule: for compatibility with <a href="#RFC2068">[RFC2068]</a>, a server MAY send a 100 (Continue) status code in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request that does not include an Expect header field with the "100-continue" expectation. This exception, the purpose of which is to minimize any client processing delays associated with an undeclared wait for 100 (Continue) status code, applies only to HTTP/1.1 requests, and not to requests with any other HTTP-version value.  </li>
<li>An origin server MAY omit a 100 (Continue) response if it has already received some or all of the request body for the corresponding request.  </li>
<li>An origin server that sends a 100 (Continue) response MUST ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is received and processed, unless it terminates the transport connection prematurely.  </li>
<li>If an origin server receives a request that does not include an Expect header field with the "100-continue" expectation, the request includes a request body, and the server responds with a final status code before reading the entire request body from the transport connection, then the server SHOULD NOT  close the transport connection until it has read the entire request, or until the client closes the connection.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">The "Connection" header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired only for that particular connection.  Such connection options MUST be removed or replaced before the message can be forwarded downstream by a proxy or gateway.  This mechanism also allows the sender to indicate which HTTP header fields used in the message are only intended for the immediate recipient ("hop-by-hop"), as opposed to all recipients on the chain ("end-to-end"), enabling the message to be self-descriptive and allowing future connection-specific extensions to be deployed in HTTP without fear that they will be blindly forwarded by previously deployed intermediaries.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.2">The Connection header field's value has the following grammar: </p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.55"></div>
<pre>
  Connection       = 1#connection-token
  connection-token = token

<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.3">A proxy or gateway MUST parse a received Connection header field before a message is forwarded and, for each connection-token in this field, remove any header field(s) from the message with the same name as the connection-token, and then remove the Connection header field itself or replace it with the sender's own connection options for the forwarded message.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.4">A sender MUST NOT include field-names in the Connection header field-value for fields that are defined as expressing constraints for all recipients in the request or response chain, such as the Cache-Control header field (Section 3.2 of <a href="#Part6">[Part6]</a>).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.5">The connection options do not have to correspond to a header field present in the message, since a connection-specific header field might not be needed if there are no parameters associated with that connection option.  Recipients that trigger certain connection behavior based on the presence of connection options MUST do so based on the presence of the connection-token rather than only the presence of the optional header field.  In other words, if the connection option is received as a header field but not indicated within the Connection field-value, then the recipient MUST ignore the connection-specific header field because it has likely been forwarded by an intermediary that is only partially compliant.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.6">When defining new connection options, specifications ought to carefully consider existing deployed header fields and ensure that the new connection-token does not share the same name as an unrelated header field that might already be deployed.  Defining a new connection-token essentially reserves that potential field-name for carrying additional information related to the connection option, since it would be unwise for senders to use that field-name for anything else.  </p>

In the case of a response to a HEAD request, Content-Length indicates the size of the payload body (not including any potential transfer-coding) that would have been sent had the request been a GET.

<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.4">Multiple Via field values represent each proxy or gateway that has forwarded the message. Each recipient MUST append its information such that the end result is ordered according to the sequence of forwarding applications.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.5">Comments MAY be used in the Via header field to identify the software of each recipient, analogous to the User-Agent and Server header fields.  However, all comments in the Via field are optional and MAY be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the message.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.6">For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to forward the request to a public proxy at p.example.net, which completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.example.com.  The request received by www.example.com would then have the following Via header field: </p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.71"></div>
<pre>
  Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 p.example.net (Apache/1.1)

<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.7">A proxy or gateway used as a portal through a network firewall SHOULD NOT forward the names and ports of hosts within the firewall region unless it is explicitly enabled to do so. If not enabled, the received-by host of any host behind the firewall SHOULD be replaced by an appropriate pseudonym for that host.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.8">For organizations that have strong privacy requirements for hiding internal structures, a proxy or gateway MAY combine an ordered subsequence of Via header field entries with identical received-protocol values into a single such entry. For example, </p>

<pre>
  Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 ethel, 1.1 fred, 1.0 lucy

<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.10">Senders SHOULD NOT combine multiple entries unless they are all under the same organizational control and the hosts have already been replaced by pseudonyms. Senders MUST NOT combine entries which have different received-protocol values.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">This section is meant to inform application developers, information providers, and users of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1 as described by this document. The discussion does not include definitive solutions to the problems revealed, though it does make some suggestions for reducing security risks.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.1">HTTP clients are often privy to large amounts of personal information (e.g., the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption keys, etc.), and SHOULD be very careful to prevent unintentional leakage of this information.  We very strongly recommend that a convenient interface be provided for the user to control dissemination of such information, and that designers and implementors be particularly careful in this area.  History shows that errors in this area often create serious security and/or privacy problems and generate highly adverse publicity for the implementor's company.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.1">A server is in the position to save personal data about a user's requests which might identify their reading patterns or subjects of interest. This information is clearly confidential in nature and its handling can be constrained by law in certain countries. People using HTTP to provide data are responsible for ensuring that such material is not distributed without the permission of any individuals that are identifiable by the published results.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.1">Implementations of HTTP origin servers SHOULD be careful to restrict the documents returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were intended by the server administrators. If an HTTP server translates HTTP URIs directly into file system calls, the server MUST take special care not to serve files that were not intended to be delivered to HTTP clients. For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems use ".." as a path component to indicate a directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP server MUST disallow any such construct in the request-target if it would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to be accessible via the HTTP server. Similarly, files intended for reference only internally to the server (such as access control files, configuration files, and script code) MUST be protected from inappropriate retrieval, since they might contain sensitive information. Experience has shown that minor bugs in such HTTP server implementations have turned into security risks.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.11.4">11.4.</a> <a href="#dns.spoofing" id="dns.spoofing">DNS Spoofing</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.1">Clients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. Clients need to be cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name association.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.2">In particular, HTTP clients SHOULD rely on their name resolver for confirmation of an IP number/DNS name association, rather than caching the result of previous host name lookups. Many platforms already can cache host name lookups locally when appropriate, and they SHOULD be configured to do so. It is proper for these lookups to be cached, however, only when the TTL (Time To Live) information reported by the name server makes it likely that the cached information will remain useful.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.3">If HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to achieve a performance improvement, they MUST observe the TTL information reported by DNS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.4">If HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when a previously-accessed server's IP address changes. As network renumbering is expected to become increasingly common <a href="#RFC1900">[RFC1900]</a>, the possibility of this form of attack will grow. Observing this requirement thus reduces this potential security vulnerability.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.5">This requirement also improves the load-balancing behavior of clients for replicated servers using the same DNS name and reduces the likelihood of a user's experiencing failure in accessing sites which use that strategy.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.11.5">11.5.</a> <a href="#attack.proxies" id="attack.proxies">Proxies and Caching</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.5.p.1">By their very nature, HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Compromise of the systems on which the proxies run can result in serious security and privacy problems. Proxies have access to security-related information, personal information about individual users and organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and content providers. A compromised proxy, or a proxy implemented or configured without regard to security and privacy considerations, might be used in the commission of a wide range of potential attacks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.5.p.2">Proxy operators need to protect the systems on which proxies run as they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive information. In particular, log information gathered at proxies often contains highly sensitive personal information, and/or information about organizations. Log information needs to be carefully guarded, and appropriate guidelines for use need to be developed and followed.  (<a href="#abuse.of.server.log.information">Section 11.2</a>).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.5.p.3">Proxy implementors need to consider the privacy and security implications of their design and coding decisions, and of the configuration options they provide to proxy operators (especially the default configuration).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.5.p.4">Users of a proxy need to be aware that proxies are no trustworthier than the people who run them; HTTP itself cannot solve this problem.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.5.p.5">The judicious use of cryptography, when appropriate, might suffice to protect against a broad range of security and privacy attacks. Such cryptography is beyond the scope of the HTTP/1.1 specification.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.12.p.1">HTTP has evolved considerably over the years. It has benefited from a large and active developer community &#8212; the many people who have participated on the www-talk mailing list &#8212; and it is that community which has been most responsible for the success of HTTP and of the World-Wide Web in general. Marc Andreessen, Robert Cailliau, Daniel W. Connolly, Bob Denny, John Franks, Jean-Francois Groff, Phillip M. Hallam-Baker, Hakon W. Lie, Ari Luotonen, Rob McCool, Lou Montulli, Dave Raggett, Tony Sanders, and Marc VanHeyningen deserve special recognition for their efforts in defining early aspects of the protocol.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.1">Although this document specifies the requirements for the generation of HTTP/1.1 messages, not all applications will be correct in their implementation. We therefore recommend that operational applications be tolerant of deviations whenever those deviations can be interpreted unambiguously.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.3">The character encoding of a representation SHOULD be labeled as the lowest common denominator of the character codes used within that representation, with the exception that not labeling the representation is preferred over labeling the representation with the labels US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1.

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.4">Additional rules for requirements on parsing and encoding of dates and other potential problems with date encodings include: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>HTTP/1.1 clients and caches SHOULD assume that an RFC-850 date which appears to be more than 50 years in the future is in fact in the past (this helps solve the "year 2000" problem).</li>
<li>Although all date formats are specified to be case-sensitive, recipients SHOULD match day, week and timezone names case-insensitively.</li>
<li>An HTTP/1.1 implementation MAY internally represent a parsed Expires date as earlier than the proper value, but MUST NOT internally represent a parsed Expires date as later than the proper value.</li>
<li>All expiration-related calculations MUST be done in GMT. The local time zone MUST NOT influence the calculation or comparison of an age or expiration time.</li>
<li>If an HTTP header field incorrectly carries a date value with a time zone other than GMT, it MUST be converted into GMT using the most conservative possible conversion.</li>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B">Appendix B.</a> <a href="#compatibility" id="compatibility">HTTP Version History</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.1">HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. The first version of HTTP, later referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for hypertext data transfer across the Internet with only a single request method (GET) and no metadata.  HTTP/1.0, as defined by <a href="#RFC1945">[RFC1945]</a>, added a range of request methods and MIME-like messaging that could include metadata about the data transferred and modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 did not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or name-based virtual hosts. The proliferation of incompletely-implemented applications calling themselves "HTTP/1.0" further necessitated a protocol version change in order for two communicating applications to determine each other's true capabilities.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.2">HTTP/1.1 remains compatible with HTTP/1.0 by including more stringent requirements that enable reliable implementations, adding only those new features that will either be safely ignored by an HTTP/1.0 recipient or only sent when communicating with a party advertising compliance with HTTP/1.1.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.3">It is beyond the scope of a protocol specification to mandate compliance with previous versions. HTTP/1.1 was deliberately designed, however, to make supporting previous versions easy.  We would expect a general-purpose HTTP/1.1 server to understand any valid request in the format of HTTP/1.0 and respond appropriately with an HTTP/1.1 message that only uses features understood (or safely ignored) by HTTP/1.0 clients.  Likewise, would expect an HTTP/1.1 client to understand any valid HTTP/1.0 response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.4">Since HTTP/0.9 did not support header fields in a request, there is no mechanism for it to support name-based virtual hosts (selection of resource by inspection of the Host header field).  Any server that implements name-based virtual hosts ought to disable support for HTTP/0.9.  Most requests that appear to be HTTP/0.9 are, in fact, badly constructed HTTP/1.x requests wherein a buggy client failed to properly encode linear whitespace found in a URI reference and placed in the request-target.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.1.1.p.1">The requirements that clients and servers support the Host header field (<a href="#header.host">Section 9.4</a>), report an error if it is missing from an HTTP/1.1 request, and accept absolute URIs (<a href="#request-target">Section 4.1.2</a>) are among the most important changes defined by HTTP/1.1.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.1.1.p.2">Older HTTP/1.0 clients assumed a one-to-one relationship of IP addresses and servers; there was no other established mechanism for distinguishing the intended server of a request than the IP address to which that request was directed. The Host header field was introduced during the development of HTTP/1.1 and, though it was quickly implemented by most HTTP/1.0 browsers, additional requirements were placed on all HTTP/1.1 requests in order to ensure complete adoption.  At the time of this writing, most HTTP-based services are dependent upon the Host header field for targeting requests.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.1.2.p.1">For most implementations of HTTP/1.0, each connection is established by the client prior to the request and closed by the server after sending the response. However, some implementations implement the Keep-Alive version of persistent connections described in Section 19.7.1 of <a href="#RFC2068">[RFC2068]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.1.2.p.2">Some clients and servers might wish to be compatible with some previous implementations of persistent connections in HTTP/1.0 clients and servers. Persistent connections in HTTP/1.0 are explicitly negotiated as they are not the default behavior. HTTP/1.0 experimental implementations of persistent connections are faulty, and the new facilities in HTTP/1.1 are designed to rectify these problems. The problem was that some existing HTTP/1.0 clients might send Keep-Alive to a proxy server that doesn't understand Connection, which would then erroneously forward it to the next inbound server, which would establish the Keep-Alive connection and result in a hung HTTP/1.0 proxy waiting for the close on the response. The result is that HTTP/1.0 clients must be prevented from using Keep-Alive when talking to proxies.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.1.2.p.3">However, talking to proxies is the most important use of persistent connections, so that prohibition is clearly unacceptable. Therefore, we need some other mechanism for indicating a persistent connection is desired, which is safe to use even when talking to an old proxy that ignores Connection. Persistent connections are the default for HTTP/1.1 messages; we introduce a new keyword (Connection: close) for declaring non-persistence. See <a href="#header.connection">Section 9.1</a>.  </p>
