Abstract 
     
  It is expected that future mobile devices will equip multiple 
  wireless interfaces in order to access the Internet ubiquitously. For 
  such a multimode mobile node (MMN) that might have multiple home 
  addresses to associate with its interfaces, the MMN has to keep its 
  interfaces awake to listen the packets to these home addresses (HoAs).
  Therefore, the MMN consumes a considerable energy to maintain the 
  reachablilities of these HoAs/interfaces. The draft presents the 
  benefits to use multiple care-of addresses and/or home addresses to 
  save the idle-mode power consumption of an MMN, and also discusses 
  the impacts and the requirements of the existing IETF protocols to 
  support the proposed low power operations.

1. Introduction 
   
  To support the access of Internet services from everywhere and at any 
  time, future mobile devices are expected to be multimode [2][4]. A 
  mobile node (MN) that equips multiple and heterogeneous wireless 
  interfaces might activate one or some of its interfaces 
  simultaneously to communicate with peer nodes. The benefits of 
  multihomed mobiles that are summarized in [2] include permanent and 
  ubiquitous access, redundancy, load sharing, load balancing, bi-
  casting, preferences, and increased bandwidth. However, to activate 
  multiple interfaces simultaneously spends considerable energy of a 
  battery operated device, and the power consumption posts a serious 
  problem for a multimode mobile node (MMN). One possible solution is 
  to set interfaces to sleep if there is no packet to send through the 
  links, but the idle interfaces still consume a significant portion of 
  the total power consumption of a mobile. For example, the power 
  consumption of a single-mode cellular phone during idle is about 10mW,
  but the power consumption of a cellular/WLAN dual-mode phone that 
  even both cellular and WLAN interfaces are set to sleep requires 50mW 
  to 100mW. The problem becomes more serious for a mobile with multiple 
  wireless interfaces, e.g. a 3G/WiMAX/WLAN/Bluetooth handset.  
   
  Another alternative to reduce the power consumption of an MMN is to 
  turn off some of its interfaces. However, the MMN might have home 
  addresses (HoAs) to associate with these turned-off interfaces, the 
  packets to these HoAs are lost. For example, a 3G/WLAN dual-mode
  handset might have two HoAs, one for 3G interface and the other for 
  WLAN interface. To disable WLAN interface of the 3G/WLAN dual-mode 
  handset to save power, the packets to the HoA of the WLAN can not
  be received.

  Here, we consider to utilize multiple care-of addresses (CoAs) and/or 
  HoAs for an MMN that could be always reachable by HoAs and can also 
  achieve energy-efficient operations during idle. We first present two 
  scenarios that an MMN could improve the energy-efficiencies of the 
  idle-mode operations by applying multiple CoAs and/or HoAs. Then, 
  we analyze the impacts and requirements of the existing IETF 
  protocols to support the proposed designs.  
   
   
2. Terminology 
   
  This draft is based on the terminology defined in [1]. For these 
  terms which are used in this draft but not defined in the existing 
  IETF documents are listed below.  
   
  Multimode Mobile Node (MMN) 
   
  A mobile node equips with more than one wireless interface. Each 
  interface has zero, one or multiple home addresses (HoAs) and/or zero,
  one or multiple care-of addresses (CoAs).  
   
3. Scenarios 
   
  Two situations are considered in this draft. First, an MMN activates 
  multiple interfaces, and each interface associates with an HoA and a 
  CoA. The MMN decides to turn off some of its wireless interfaces in 
  order to save the power, but does not want to lose packets to these 
  HoAs/interfaces that are turned off. The second situation is that an 
  MMN activates multiple interfaces, each interface associates with a 
  CoA, but all interfaces share the same HoA. The MMN decides to turn 
  off some of its wireless interfaces in order to save the power, while 
  the MMN receives the packets to the HoA via a particular wireless 
  interface, it turns on its preferred interface to communicate with 
  peer nodes.  
   
3.1 An MMN with multiple HoAs and multiple CoAs 
   
  In this situation, an MMN has an HoA for each wireless interface (IF).
  The MMN acquires a CoA in the visiting network and registers the CoA 
  to the home agent (HA) of the HoA for a particular interface. The MMN 
  might associate multiple HoAs which are multi-prefixed for one 
  interface, but here, we assume the each interface has one HoA in its 
  home network (HNW), and one CoA in the visiting network (VNW). Figure 
  1 shows an example. Step 1 to Step 6 of Figure 1 demonstrate the 
  message exchanging between the MMN and HAs. In order to save the 
  power, the MMN decides to turn off interface two (IF#2) and interface 
  three (IF#3), but it still wants to receive packets to home addresses 
  of IF#2 and IF#3, i.e. HoA#2 and HoA#3. Then, the MMN uses the HoA#1 
  as the CoA to register HA#2 and HA#3, i.e. Step 7 and Step 9. Once

  the CoA registration is complete, the MMN can turn off the IF#2 and 
  IF#3 to conserve the energy. In Step 11, the packets sent to HoA#3 of 
  IF#3 are received by the HA#3, the packets are forwarded to the CoA 
  of IF#3, i.e. the HoA#1. The HA#1 receives the packets, and forwards 
  the packets to CoA#1 so that the MMN can receive the packets via the 
  IF#1. Since the MMN can detect the packets which are sent to MMN's 
  HoA#3, the packets can be seen as paging packets to wake up the MMN's 
  IF#3. The MMN can either use the CoA#1/IF#1 to update the binding on 
  the correspondent node (CN) if the MMN prefers to use the IF#1 to 
  communicate with the CN. Otherwise, the MMN can turn on the IF#3, 
  acquires the CoA#3, and updates the binding on CN and HA#3. To use 
  multiple care-of addresses and home addresses for MMNs can reduce the 
  power consumption of MMNs in the idle mode and all home addresses of 
  the MMNs are always reachable even some interfaces are turned off.

3.2 An MMN with one HoA and multiple CoAs 
   
  The second situation is that an MMN has multiple interfaces, each 
  interface associates with a CoA, but all interfaces share the same 
  HoA. Figure 2 shows an example. Step 1 to Step 6 demonstrate to bind 
  multiple CoAs to a given HoA. The binding update should have the 
  information to tell the HA the priorities or the preferences of the 
  interfaces from which an MMN prefers to receive the packets. Then, 
  the MMN can turn off some of its wireless interfaces, i.e. Step 7 of 
  Figure 2, to save the power. While incoming packets are received by 
  the HA, it forwards the packets to MMN's CoAs based on the 
  preferences of priorities. Once the MMN receives the packets, the MMN
  further decides and turns on a proper interface to communicate with 
  peer nodes. To use multiple care-of addresses for one home addresses 
  for MMNs can also reduce the power consumption of an MMN in the idle 
  mode.

4. Impact Analysis 
   
  To implement the above operations on MMNs, the impacts to the 
  existing protocols are analyzed. 
   
4.1 An MMN with multiple HoAs and multiple CoAs 
   
  To implement the low power operation of an MMN with multiple HoAs and 
  multiple CoAs described in Section 3.1, the requirements are similar 
  to the Section 6.2.2 in [5] that presents the requirements to use one 
  HoA as a CoA and its implementation based on the current mobile IPv6 
  [3]. However, an MMN should implement its own power management scheme 
  to decide which and the number of interfaces to sleep and to wake up, 
  and the time to wake up and to sleep. That is an implementation issue.
   
4.2 An MMN with one HoA and multiple CoAs 
   
  To implement the operation of an MMN with one HoA and multiple CoAs 
  described in Section 3.2, the requirements are described in the 
  Section 6.2.1 in [5] that presents the requirements to bind multiple 
  CoAs to a given HoA. Unfortunately, the MIPv6 specification does not 
  support this function currently. Besides the requirements to bind 
  multiple CoAs to a given HoA, the priorities or the preferences of 
  the CoAs that packets should be forwarded to should be carried in the 
  binding update or other MIP messages and extensions such as [6]. 
  Moreover, an MMN should implement its own power management scheme to 
  decide which and the number of interfaces to sleep and to wake up, 
  and the time to wake up and to sleep. That is also an implementation 
  issue. 
   
5. Summary and Future Work  
   
  The draft suggested to use multiple care-of addresses and/or home 
  addresses for an MMN in order to save the power consumption of a 
  mobile with multiple interfaces. Two usage scenarios are presented to 
  demonstrate the benefits of the design. The impact analysis shows 
  that the extension of the existing mobile IPv6 is required and needs 
  to be further designed to support this feature.  
   
Security Considerations 
   
  Security concerns should be further studied.
