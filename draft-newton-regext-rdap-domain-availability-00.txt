Internet-Draft          RDAP Domain Availability           December 2016


1.  Introduction

   While RDAP [RFC7480] has all the necessary properties to serve the
   information necessary to determine if a domain name is available for
   registration, without proper signalling an RDAP server is likely to
   return more information than is required to fulfill this requirement,
   thus wasting bandwidth and server resources, and may return negative
   answers when positive answers are more appropriate.

   This document defines HTTP query parameters to be used by clients to
   signal the intent of the query is for an availability check.  Servers
   may then respond with a much smaller and less costly payload than
   they would have otherwise.  The contents of the payload would be at
   the discretion of the policies of the server operator within the
   guidelines of RDAP responses [RFC7483].

2.  Query Parameter

   To signal that the client is only interested in domain availability
   checking, the client MUST use the query parameter 'availabilityCheck'
   in the RDAP query for a domain with value '1'.  This query parameter
   has no meaning for other RDAP queries, and therefore should be
   ignored in those cases.

     The following is an example RDAP query for a domain availability
                                  check.

      https://example.com/rdap/domain/example.com?availabilityCheck=1

                       Figure 1: Example RDAP Query

                   The following is an example response.

        {
          "rdapConformance" : [ "rdap_level_0", "domain_check_0" ],
          "objectClassName" : "domain",
          "ldhName" : "example.com",
          "status" : [ "inactive", "redemption period" ]
        }

    This response, not including the HTTP headers, is 174 octets long.

                      Figure 2: Example RDAP Response

   When this query parameter is given, servers MUST reply with HTTP
   return codes as specified in Section 3.

3.  Positive and Negative Answers

   RDAP [RFC7480] provides guidance on using HTTP return codes more
   contextual for the lookup of domain registration information than
   domain availability information.  A query for domain registration
   information should result in a negative answer (e.g. 404 NOT FOUND)
   if the name is not registered (or not in active use or in another
   state where it may be considered to have a unregistration according
   to policy).  However, a query for domain availability information
   upon the same domain name should yield a positive answer if the
   domain is available for registration within the bounds of the
   registry policy.  In other words, the return codes may vary given the
   appropriate context.

   In the context of domain availability, RDAP servers should return
   positive answers (in accordance with server policies for rate
   limiting and access control) if the domain registry for which the
   RDAP server is responding allows registration of the queried domain
   even if the domain is currently registered at the time of the query.
   For example, an RDAP server answering for foo.example would return a
   positive answer (i.e. 200 OK) for fiz.foo.example if the domain
   status was active or inactive, but it would return a negative answer
   for buzz.bar.example because it is not the registry for bar.example.

   The example in Figure 2 shows a positive answer for a domain that is
   inactive (i.e. not registered).  This example shows a positive answer
    for a domain that is active, including variants and the expiration
                                   date.

4.  Availability Information Query

   All of the examples given in this document have been reduced from
   examples in [RFC7483], demonstrating that domain availability
   information is a subset of domain registration information in the
   RDAP data model.  Some clients may desire both domain registration
   information and domain availability information.  To signal that the
   client is interested in both contexts, the client MUST use the query
   parameter 'availabilityInformation' in the RDAP query for a domain
   with value '1'.  This query parameter has no meaning for other RDAP
   queries, and therefore should be ignored in those cases.

   Servers MUST respond with positive answers as specified in Section 3,
   but SHOULD NOT redact other registration information (i.e. entities,
   name servers, etc...) in accordance with their access policies.

5.  RDAP Conformance

   Servers MUST include "domain_check_0" in the rdapConformance array of
   their response when modifying their behavior according to this
   specification.  That is, this value should only be placed in the
   array when responding to a query with one of the query parameters in
   Section 2 or Section 4.
