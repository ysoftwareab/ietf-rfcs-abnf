1  Introduction

   The document discusses the motivation and use-cases for coding third-
   party aware tags for content/source related information into resource
   retrieval process.

2  Motivating Senarios

2.1 Content Caching

   As stated earlier, cache systems are considered to be an effective
   way to reduce the prohibitive expense for cross-boundary traffic from
   large ISP with most ICPs to small ISPs providing local services to a
   specific group of subscribers. The cache system automatically buffers
   the hotspot resources locally and reduces the traffic from the large
   operators by feeding the requested content locally.

   However, observed from the reality of operating, the local cache
   system can't fully implement traffic localization, as there are vast
   user requests redirected to other operators by DNS, even when the
   requested content is actually cached locally. 

   The main reason is that the work pattern of cache system is fully
   passive and the cache system uses the DPI technology to acquire the
   URL to identify for buffered content and match them with subsequent
   content requests, which causes undesirable cache misses in the
   following two cases:

   On the one hand, for video websites using the anti-stealing-link
   mechanism, which updates the URL for the same content periodically
   with new ones, subsequent requests are therefore subject to change
   even from the same website. 

   On the other hand, for the requests from the local subscribers to
   different websites, the cache system cannot recognize a content hit
   even if the content they are requesting are identical, as their URLs
   are likely to be different.

2.2 Reverse Charging

   The dominating billing method is subscriber-oriented model, which is
   used by the operator to charge the subscriber for the volume of or
   expected bandwidth for the Internet traffic he consumes for a given
   period of time (e.g. on a monthly basis). In practice, such model is
   implemented by the network devices monitoring the flows targeted to
   or originated from  a given subscriber (e.g. local IP address). 

   However, reverse charging is becoming a desirable new billing method,

   which is motivated from ICPs, who want to cooperative with the ISPs
   to enable free-access to its content/service from the subscribers to
   attract users, especially the mobile subscribers. The key to enable
   such billing model is how to effectively distinguish the traffic
   flows belonging to the same content/application which might be
   comprised of complex  groups of IP flows from others. The current
   subscriber-based billing model is not very helpful in such scenario.

3  Requirements

3.1 Identifying the content

   In order to improve the hit ratio and actively push the hot resources
   to the local subscribers, the cache system need a succinct way to
   learn the buffered contents and can judge the hot content according
   to the actual content information. 

3.2 Identifying the source

   To enable flexible reverse charging, we need a third party
   recognizable tag of the traffic for the charging GW located between
   the client and server, which helps in recognition of its source and
   billing model, and other features to enable other cultivated
   transport services, e.g. QoS for selected content types for a given
   ICP.

4 Challenges

4.1 Identifiers of the content

   Current identifiers for web content (e.g. URL) is based on its
   location, rather than the real content. Content tagging is expected
   to be helpful to address these requirements. E.g. to mark the content
   information and encode this flag/tag into the content's URL, which
   identifies its binary content and other application metadata. The
   cache system can know the exact content by analyze the content flag
   in the URL link and need no changes to any protocol.


4.2 On identifying the source

   It is expected that tag for the source in the reverse charging case
   is independent of IP address and above of IP layer, since source IP
   is not working for CDN cases. 

   The tag is expected to also provide information about content type
   for finer-grained charging policies, as the diversity of network
   applications has high demand for the charging policy flexibility,

   e.g. a single application may produce both video traffic and audio
   traffic, which decides to complain its upgraded video service for
   free while keeping its commercial voice service intact.

4.3 On tagging the encrypted traffic

   Another big challenge for third-party resource tagging is encryption.
   If the tag is added at the application layer and encrypted end-to-
   end, that would block a cache or charging GW to retrieval the
   embedded information.
