1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide many detailed reports and
   documents that their registrars require on a daily, weekly and
   monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction reports, as
   well as lists containing currently unavailable domains and current
   premium domain fees. These reports are critical for registrars'
   businesses and play an important role in accounting and operations
   processes as well as in sales and marketing activities. In the
   current set-up, registrars must download these reports from each
   registry's intranet differently according to each registry's document
   management set up.

   This document describes the default Report Structure for Reports
   which can be provide via the
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-reporting-repository].

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   specified in their uppercase forms.

Internet-Draft                 Report Structure               April 2019
   
2.1.  Internationalized Domain Names

   Top-level domains and domain names contained in a file name or file
   MUST be written as A-LABEL according to [RFC5890].

2.2.  Dates and Times

   All dates and times attribute values MUST be expressed in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar. The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in ISO
   8601 [RFC3339] MUST be used to represent date-time values.
   
   One day is defined as one day in UTC+0. Therefore, months and years
   will also be calculated on this basis.
   
2.3.  Character Encoding

   Files and their content MUST be encoded in UTF-8 according to
   [RFC3629].
   
2.4.  Currency

   Currencies MUST be listed with the relevant three letter currency
   alphabetic code according to ISO 4217 (https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-
   currency-codes.html).
   
3.  File Names

   Files MUST be lowercase and follow this grammar:
   
   PREFIX '_' TYPE '_' DATE '.' FILESUFFIX
   
   PREFIX      indicates if the file is either a report specific for
               a TLD or a registry. A report of a registry MAY include
               more than one TLD.
   
   TYPE        indicates the type of the file, the value MUST be either
               'premium-domains', 'unavailable-domains' or
               'transactions'.
   
   DATE        indicates the date of the file and MUST be
               YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM according to ISO 8601 [RFC3339]
   
   FILESUFFIX  identifier specified as a suffix to the name of the file
               and indicated a characteristic of the file contents or
               its intended use. The file suffix MUST be csv.

Internet-Draft                 Report Structure               April 2019
               
   Example based on the above grammar:
   
   Daily report of premium domain names for the TLD .example effective
   on 2018-08-01: example_premium-domains_2018-08-01.csv.gz
   
   Monthly report of transactions for the TLD .example effective on
   2018-08: example_transactions_2018-08.csv.gz
   
   Monthly report of premium domain names for the .example registry
   effective on 2018-08: example-registry_premium-domains_2018-08.csv.gz
      
4.  File Types

   Files MUST be CSV files according to [RFC4180]. It is RECOMMENDED
   to compress with gzip according to [RFC1952].

5.  Delimiter

   The delimiter MUST be a comma.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations
   
   The registry report structure described in this document does not
   provide any security services.

8.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
