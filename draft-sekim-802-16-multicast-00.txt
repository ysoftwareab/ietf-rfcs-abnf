1.  Introduction

   The IEEE 802.16 based network supports both fixed, nomadic
   [IEEE802.16] and mobile [IEEE802.16e]network environments.  The
   [IEEE802.16] standards specify wireless media to share multiple
   mobile nodes: point-to-multipoint and mesh.  The PMP modes, point-to-
   multipoint, operate that uplink supports only unicast and downlink
   can support multicast.  Therefore [IEEE802.16] can not generally
   support multicast compared to [IEEE802.3] that supports broadcast
   [RFC2464].

   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs] describes IPv6 related convergence
   sublayer for unicast.  The multicast transport capabilities are
   important to both control and bearer aspects in Internet Protocol.
   The [RFC0826] for IPv4 and [RFC2461] for IPv6 require multicast
   capabilities for control aspects.

   The [IEEE802.16] standards specify service specific convergence
   sublayer to process higher-layer protocol data unit based on
   classification.  The types of service specific convergence sublayer
   are asynchronous transfer mode and packets such as IPv6, IPv4, IEEE
   802.3/Ethernet, IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, IPv6 over IEEE 802.3/Ethernet, IPv6
   over IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, IPv4 over IEEE 802.3/Ethernet, IPv4 over IEEE
   802.1Q VLAN and so on.  A multicast capability depends on the
   convergence sublayer parameters of REGISTRATION message at IEEE
   802.16 MAC messages.  This document describes IPv6 multicast
   [RFC4291] transport over IEEE 802.16 networks in accordance with
   convergence sublayer.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 'RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Link layer format for IEEE 802.16 Network

   An 802.16 PDU consists of a MAC header, a data payload and CRC as
   shown in Figure 1.  The CRC field is an optional.

4.  CS Specific Multicast in IEEE 802.16 Network

4.1.  Multicast on IPv6 CS

   The MAC signaling type 1 and signaling type 2 do not deliver a
   payload.  The 802.16 frame with generic MAC header can deliver IPv6
   packet.  The generic MAC header uses for IEEE 802.16 frame for native
   IPv6 convergence sublayer.

   The 48 bits address values in IEEE 802.3 header are used to identify
   at the link layer.  However, the IEEE802.16 MAC header does not have
   a link layer address.  Instead, the CID fields in the MAC header
   perform link layer identification between MN and BS.

   IPv6 multicast address may use with CID fields at the 802.16 link
   layer as shown in Figure 3.

                   Figure 3: Direct mapping for IPv6 CS

   The multicast CID, 0XFFA0-0xFEFE, SHOULD use to multicast in IEEE
   802.16 specification.  The other CIDs are multicast polling CID,
   normal mode multicast CID, sleep mode multicast CID, idle mode
   multicast CID, fragmentable broadcast CID and broadcast CID.  It is
   for specific usage and difficult to identify layer 3 multicast
   addresses.

   The information for 802.16 multicast in CID may use scope field and
   multicast group identifier that specified by [RFC4291].  The scope
   and multicast group identifier are important to identify multicast
   address [IPv6MA].  IPv6 multicast address prefix (0xFF) translate to
   802.16 CID multicast group (0xFE).

   The flag information on IPv6 multicast address normally use zero.
   So, 802.16 CID may not use flag in [RFC4291] for multicast mapping.
   The scope information on IPv6 multicast address in important.
   Rherefore, 802.16 CID SHOULD use scope information for multicasting.

   The last 4 bits in group identifier are important to IPv6 multicast
   address [RFC4291].  The multicast group identifier uses last 4 bits
   to 12 bits based on the purpose.  So, last 4 bits of the IPv6
   multicast group identifier shall use because only 4 bits are
   available at CID.  The duplication of the last 4 bits for multicast
   can resolve by use of scope information.  The unique identification
   to the whole IPv6 multicast address requires modification of such
   specification as [IEEE802.16], [RFC2460], [RFC4291].  Therefore,
   Figure 3 RECOMMENDED IPv6 multicast address mapping to 802.16 CID.

4.2.  Multicast on Ethernet CS and IEEE 802.1Q VLAN CS

   IPv6 multicast require at IPv6 over IEEE802.3 or [IEEE802.1Q] VLAN
   CS.  In this case, IPv6 multicast mapping to 802.16 CID may use

   either direct mapping or indirect mapping.  The direct mapping scheme
   is described in section 4.1.

   IPv6 multicast mapping to CID may use indirect mapping as following.
   Firstly, [RFC2464] use for IPv6 multicast address mapping to
   destination address at 802.3 link layer.  After that, multicast
   address at 802.3 frame may translate to 602.16 CID as shown in Figure
   3.  A BS transmit IPv6 multicast packet that destination address
   start with 0X3333 at 802.3 frame for IPv6 over IEEE802.3 or VLAN
   encapsulation
