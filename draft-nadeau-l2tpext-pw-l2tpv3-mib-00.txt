 Abstract 
   
  This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management 
  Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in 
  the Internet community.  In particular, it describes a MIB module 
  for PW operation over Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (Version 3) 
  "L2TPV3".

1 Introduction 
   
  This document describes a model for managing pseudo wire services 
  for transmission over different flavors of L2TP tunnels. The 
  general PW MIB module [PW-MIB] defines the parameters global to the 
  PW regardless of underlying PSN and emulated service. Indicating 
  PSN type of L2TP in PW-MIB references this module. 
   
  This document describes the MIB objects that define pseudo wire 
  association to the L2TP PSN, in a way that is not specific to the 
  carried service.  
   
Conventions used in this document 
   
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 
  [BCP14]. 
   
2 Terminology 
   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW 
  architecture [RFC3985], [RFC3916] and [RFC4447]. 
   
  "PSN Tunnel" is a general term indicating a virtual connection 
  between the two PWE3 edge devices. Each tunnel may potentially 
  carry multiple PWs inside. In the scope of this document, it is 
  L2TPv3 tunnel. 
   
  In L2TPv3 PSN, a PW connection typically uses L2TPv3 session to
  carry the traffic.

3 The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
    
  For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current   
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
  of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
   
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
  generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
  (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined 
  in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo 
  specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is 
  described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] 
  and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].  
    
 4 Feature Checklist 
   
  The PW L2TP MIB module is designed to satisfy the following 
  requirements and constraints: 
   
   - The MIB module supports both manually configured and signaled 
     PWs. 
   
   - The MIB module supports point-to-point PW connections.  
   
   - The MIB module enables the use of any emulated service.  
   
   
 5 MIB module usage 
   
  The MIB module structure for defining a PW service is composed from 
  three types of modules. 
   
  The first type is the PW MIB module [PW-MIB], which configures 
  general parameters of the PW that are common to all types of 
  emulated services and PSN. 
   
  The second type of modules is per PSN module. There is a separate 
  module for each type of PSN. This document defines the MIB module 
  for L2TPV3 (PW-L2TPV3-MIB). 
   
  The third type of modules is service-specific module, which is 
  emulated signal type dependent. These modules are defined in other 
  documents; see for example [CEPMIB]. 
   
  [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in this module. 
   
   
5.1 PW MPLS MIB module usage 
   
    - The PW table (pwTable) in [PW-MIB] is used for all PW types 



IETF L2TPEXT Working Group         Expires April 2007        [Page 3]

    (ATM, FR, Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level 
    generic parameters related to the PW creation. The operator or the 
    agent create a row for each PW. 
   
    - If the selected PSN type in pwTable is L2TP, the agent creates a 
    row in the MPLS specific parameters table (pwL2tpv3Table) in this 
    module, which contains L2TP specific parameters such as session 
    ids etc.
     
    - The operator configures the association to the desired L2TPv3 
    tunnel (required for manually configured PWs) through the 
    pwL2tpMappingTable[TBD].

7 Security Considerations 
   
  It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
  monitoring of PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for 
  configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be 
  configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially 
  disastrous results. 
      
  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
  network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    The pwL2tpv3Table and pwL2tpv3MappingTable[TBD] collectively
          contain objects to provision PW over L2TPV3 tunnels.  
          Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could 
          result in disruption of traffic on the network.  The use of 
          stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be 
          considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and
          USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB
          module.   
          Administrators should consider whether read access to these  
          objects should be allowed, since read access may be  
          undesirable under certain circumstances. 
   
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with 
  a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive 
  or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
  to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
  possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
  them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects 
  and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwL2tpv3Table and pwL2tpv3MappingTable[TBD],  
          collectively show the PW over L2TPV3 association.   
          If an Administrator does not want to reveal this 
          information, then these tables should be 
          considered sensitive/vulnerable. 
   
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
  Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
  even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
  allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the 
  objects in this MIB module. 
   
  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
  as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8", 
  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
  authentication and privacy".

  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
  instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
  to the objects only to those principals "users" that have 
  legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.
