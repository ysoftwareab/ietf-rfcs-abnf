   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   As defined in [RFC1195] and extended in [RFC3784], the IS-IS protocol
   [ISO10589] may be used to distribute IPv4 prefix reachability
   information throughout an IS-IS domain.  In addition, thanks to
   extensions made in [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology] and
   [I-D.ietf-isis-ipv6], IS-IS may be used to distribute IPv6
   reachability information.

   The IPv4 prefix information is encoded as TLV type 128 and 130 in
   [RFC1195], with additional information carried in TLV 135 as
   specified in [RFC3784] and TLV 235 as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology].  In particular, the extended IP
   Reachability TLV (TLV 135) contains support for a larger metric
   space, an up/down bit to indicate redistribution between different
   levels in the hierarchy, an IP prefix, and one or more sub-TLVs that
   can be used to carry specific information about the prefix.  TLV 235
   is a derivative of TLV 135, with the addition of Multi-Topology
   membership information [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology].  The IPv6
   prefix information is encoded as TLV 236 in [I-D.ietf-isis-ipv6] and
   TLV 237 in [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology].

   This draft proposes 2 new sub-TLVs for TLV 135, TLV 235, TLV 236 and
   TLV 237 that may be used to carry administrative information about an
   IP prefix.


3.  Sub-TLV Additions

   This draft proposes 2 new "Administrative Tag" sub-TLVs to be added
   to TLV 135, TLV 235, TLV 236 and TLV 237.  These TLVs specify one or
   more 32 or 64 bit unsigned integers that may be associated with an IP
   prefix.  Example uses of these tags include controlling
   redistribution between levels and areas, different routing protocols,
   or multiple instances of IS-IS running on the same router, or
   carrying BGP standard or extended communities.

   The methods for which their use is employed is beyond the scope of
   this document and left to the implementer and/or operator.

   The encoding of the sub-TLV(s) is discussed in the following

   subsections.

3.1.  32-bit Administrative Tag Sub-TLV 1

   The Administrative Tag SHALL be encoded as one or more 4 octet
   unsigned integers using Sub-TLV 1 in TLV-135 [RFC3784], TLV 235
   [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology], TLV 236 [I-D.ietf-isis-ipv6] and
   TLV 237 [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology].  The Administrative Tag
   Sub-TLV has following structure:

   o  1 octet of type (value: 1)

   o  1 octet of length (value: multiple of 4)

   o  one or more instances of 4 octets of administrative tag

   On receipt, an implementation MAY consider only one encoded tag, in
   which case the first encoded tag MUST be considered and any
   additional tags ignored.  A tag value of zero is reserved and SHOULD
   be treated as "no tag".

3.2.  64-bit Administrative Tag Sub-TLV 2

   The Administrative Tag SHALL be encoded as one or more 8 octet
   unsigned integers using Sub-TLV 2 in TLV-135 [RFC3784], TLV 235
   [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology], TLV 236 [I-D.ietf-isis-ipv6] and
   TLV 237 [I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology].  The 64-bit Administrative
   Tag Sub-TLV has following structure:

   o  1 octet of type (value: 2)

   o  1 octet of length (value: multiple of 8)

   o  one or more instances of 8 octets of administrative tag

   On receipt, an implementation MAY consider only one encoded tag, in
   which case the first encoded tag MUST be considered and any
   additional tags ignored.  A tag value of zero is reserved and SHOULD
   be treated as "no tag".


4.  Ordering of Tags

   The semantics of the tag order are implementation-dependent.  That
   is, there is no implied meaning to the ordering of the tags that
   indicates a certain operation or set of operations need be performed
   based on the order of the tags.  Each tag SHOULD be treated as an
   autonomous identifier that MAY be used in policy to perform a policy



Previdi, et al.           Expires May 22, 2008                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              IS-IS Admin Tags               November 2007


   action.  Whether or not tag A precedes or succeeds tag B SHOULD not
   change the meaning of the tag set.  However, when propagating TLVs
   containing multiple tags between levels, an implementation SHOULD
   preserve the ordering such that the first tag remains the first tag,
   so that implementations which only recognise a single tag will have a
   consistent view across levels.

   Each IS that receives an LSP with TLV(s) 135 and/or 235 and/or 236
   and/or 237, that have associated SubTLV(s) 1 and/or 2, MAY operate on
   the tag values as warranted by the implementation.  If an
   implementation needs to change tag values, for example, when
   propagating TLVs between levels at an area boundary, then the TLV(s)
   SHOULD be copied to the newly generated Level-1 or Level-2 LSP at
   which point, the contents of the SubTLV(s) MAY change as dictated by
   the policy action.  In the event that no change is required, the
   SubTLV(s) SHOULD be copied in order into the new LSP, such that
   ordering is preserved.


5.  Compliance

   A compliant IS-IS implementation MUST be able to assign one tag to
   any IP prefix in any of the following TLVs: TLV 135, TLV 235, TLV
   236, TLV 237.  It MUST be able to interpret a single tag present in
   the sub-TLV, or the first tag where there is more than one tag
   present in the sub-TLV

   A compliant IS-IS implementation MAY be able to assign more than one
   tag to any IP prefix in any of the following TLVs: TLV 135, TLV 235,
   TLV 236, TLV 237.  It MAY be able to interpret the second and
   subsequent tags where more than one tag is present in the sub-TLV

   A compliant IS-IS implementation MAY be able to rewrite or remove one
   or more tags associated with a prefix in any of the following TLVs:
   TLV 135, TLV 235, TLV 236, TLV 237 when propagating TLVs between
   levels.


6.  Operations

   An administrator associates an Administrative Tag value with some
   interesting property.  When IS-IS advertises reachability for some IP
   prefix that has that property, it adds the Administrative Tag to the
   IP reachability information TLV for that prefix, and the tag "sticks"
   to the prefix as it is flooded throughout the routing domain.

   Consider the network in Figure 1.  We wish to "leak" L1 prefixes
   [RFC2966] with some property, A, from L2 to the L1 router R1.

Internet-Draft              IS-IS Admin Tags               November 2007


   Without policy- groups, there is no way for R2 to know property A
   prefixes from property B prefixes.

                                R2--------R3--------R4
                         L2     /                    \
                         - - - /- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                         L1   /                        \
                            R1----1.1.1.0/24 (A)       R5
                                                        |
                                                        |
                                                  1.1.2.0/24 (B)

                        Figure 1: Example of usage

   We associate Administrative Tag 100 with property A, and have R5
   attach that value to the IP extended reachability information TLV for
   prefix 1.1.2.0/24.  R2 has a policy in place to "match prefixes with
   Administrative Tag 100, and leak to L1."

   The previous example is rather simplistic; it seems that it would be
   just as easy for R2 simply to match the prefix 1.1.2.0/24.  However,
   if there are a large number of routers that need to apply some policy
   according to property A and large number of "A" prefixes, this
   mechanism can be quite helpful.

   Implementations which support only a single tag and those which
   support multiple tags may co-exist in the same IS-IS domain.  An
   implementatation supporting multiple tags SHOULD therefor assign any
   tag which is required to be interpretted by all systems as the first
   tag in any set of multiple tags.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS, as any
   annotations to IP prefixes should not pass outside the administrative
   control of the network operator of the IS-IS domain.  Such an
   allowance would violate the spirit of Interior Gateway Protocols in
   general and IS-IS in particular


8.  IANA Considerations

   The authors have chosen "1" as the type code of the 32-bits
   Administrative Tag Sub-TLV and "2" as the type code of the 64-bits
   Administrative Tag Sub-TLV.  These values must be allocated by IANA.

9.  Manageability Considerations

   These extensions which have been designed, developed and deployed for
   many years do not have any new impact on management and operation of
   the ISIS protocol via this standardization process.
