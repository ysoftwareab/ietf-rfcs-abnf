DAC=0 and DAM=01 when destination prefix is link-local, and DAC=1 and
DAM=01 if compression context has been configured for the destination
DAM=11 (if the context covers a full 128-bit address).  DAC MUST be
SAC=1/SAM=11 or DAC=1/DAM=11.

DAC=1/DAM=10, as the first 112 bits of the address are the same
