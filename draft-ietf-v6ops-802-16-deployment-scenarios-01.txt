Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Recently, broadband wireless access network is emerging for wireless
   communication for user requirements such as high quality data/voice
   service, fast mobility, wide coverage, etc.  The IEEE 802.16 Working
   Group develops standards and recommended practices to support the
   development and deployment of broadband wireless metropolitan area
   networks.

   Whereas the [IEEE802.16] standard addresses fixed wireless
   applications only, the [IEEE802.16e] standard serves the needs of
   fixed, nomadic, and fully mobile networks.  It adds mobility support
   to the original standard so that mobile subscriber stations can move
   during services.  The standardization of IEEE 802.16e is completed,
   which plans to support mobility up to speeds of 70~80 mile/h that
   will enable the subscribers to carry mobile devices such as PDAs,
   phones, or laptops.  IEEE 802.16e is one of the most promising access
   technologies which would be applied to the IP-based broadband mobile
   communication.

   As the deployment of wireless broadband access network progresses,
   users will be connected to IPv6 networks.  While the IEEE 802.16
   defines the encapsulation of an IPv4/IPv6 datagram in an IEEE 802.16
   MAC payload, a complete description of IPv4/IPv6 operation and
   deployment is not present.  In this document, we will discuss main
   components of IPv6 IEEE 802.16 access network and its differences
   from IPv4 IEEE 802.16 networks and how IPv6 is deployed and
   integrated in each of the IEEE 802.16 technologies using tunneling
   mechanisms and native IPv6.

   This document extends works of [I-D.ietf-v6ops-bb-deployment-
   scenarios] and follows the structure and common terminology of the
   document.

2.  Wireless Broadband Access Network Technologies - IEEE 802.16

   This section describes the infrastructure that is based on IEEE
   802.16 networks providing wireless broadband services to the
   customer.  It also describes a way to deploy IPv6 over IEEE 802.16
   networks.

2.1.  Elements of IEEE 802.16 Networks

   The IEEE 802.11 access network (WLAN) has driven the revolution of
   wireless communication.  However, the more people use it the more its
   limitations such as short range and lack of mobility support arose.
   Compared with such IEEE 802.11 network, IEEE 802.16 supports enhanced
   features such as wider coverage and mobility.  So it is expected that
   IEEE 802.16 network could be the next step of IEEE 802.11 network.

   The mechanism of transporting IP traffic over IEEE 802.16 networks is
   outlined in [IEEE802.16], but the details of IPv6 operations over
   IEEE 802.16 are being discussed now.

   Here are some of the key elements of an IEEE 802.16 network:

   o  MS: Mobile Station.  A station in the mobile service intended to
      be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points.  A
      mobile station (MS) is always a subscriber station (SS) which must
      provide mobility function.

   o  BS: Base Station.  A generalized equipment set providing
      management and control of MS connections.  There is a
      unidirectional mapping between BS and MS medium access control
      (MAC) peers for the purpose of transporting a service flow's
      traffic.  A connection is identified by a connection identifier
      (CID).  All traffic is carried on the connection.  Sometimes there
      can be alternative IEEE 802.16 network deployment where a BS is
      integrated with an access router, composing one box in view of
      implementation.

   o  AR: Access Router.  A generalized equipment set providing IP
      connectivity between BS and IP based network.  An AR performs
      first hop routing function to all MS.

   Figure 1 illustrates the key elements of IEEE 802.16(e) networks.

2.2.  Deploying IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks

   [IEEE802.16] specifies two modes for sharing the wireless medium:
   point-to-multipoint (PMP) and mesh (optional).  This document only
   focuses on PMP mode.

   Some of the factors that hinder deployment of native IPv6 core
   protocols are introduced by [I-D.jee-16ng-problem-statement].  The
   summary of them is as follows:

   1.  Lacking of Facility for IPv6 Native Multicasting

   IEEE 802.16 PMP mode is a connection oriented technology without bi-
   directional native multicast support.  IPv6 neighbor discovery
   [RFC2461] supports various functions for the interaction between
   nodes attached on the same subnet, such as on-link determination and
   address resolution.  It is designed with no dependence on a specific
   link layer technology, but requires that the link layer technology
   support native multicast.  This lacking of facility for IPv6 native
   multicast results in inappropriateness to apply the standard neighbor
   discover protocol specially regarding, address resolution, router
   discovery, stateless auto-configuration and duplicated address
   detection.

   2.  Impact on IPv6 Subnet Model

   IEEE 802.16 is different from existing wireless access technologies
   such as IEEE 802.11 or 3G, and, while IEEE 802.16 defines the
   encapsulation of an IP datagram in an IEEE 802.16 MAC payload, a
   complete description of IPv6 operation is not present.  IEEE 802.16
   can rather benefit from IETF input and specification to support IPv6
   operation.  Especially, BS should look at the classifiers and decide
   where to send the packet, since IEEE 802.16 connection always ends at



Shin, et al.              Expires April 4, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        October 2006


   BS, while IPv6 connection terminates at a default router.  This
   operation and limitation may be dependent on the given subnet model
   [I-D.madanapalli-16ng-subnet-model-analysis].

   3.  Multiple Convergence Sublayers (CS)

   There are operational complexity problems of IP over 802.16 caused by
   the existence of multiple convergence sublayers [I-D.iab-link-
   encaps].  We should consider which type of Convergence Sublayer (CS)
   can be efficiently used on each subnet models and scenarios.  IEEE
   802.16 CS delivers and classifies various kinds of higher layer PDUs
   such as ATM, IPv4 packet and IPv6 packets over radio channel.  For
   this purpose, IEEE 802.16 introduces the Connection Identifier (CID).
   Generally, CS performs the following functions in terms of IP packet
   transmission: 1) Receipt of protocol data units (PDUs) from the
   higher layer, 2) Performing classification and CID mapping of the
   PDUs, 3) Delivering the PDUs to the appropriate MAC SAP, 4) Receipt
   of PDUs from the peer MAC SAP, and 5) Forwarding the PDUs to the
   corresponding AR.  The specification of IEEE 802.16 defines several
   CSs for carrying IP packets, but does not provide a detailed
   description of how to carry them.  The several CSs are generally
   classified into two types of CS: IPv6 CS and Ethernet CS.

   In addition, due to the problems caused by the existence of multiple
   convergence sublayers [I-D.iab-link-encaps], the mobile access
   scenarios need solutions about how roaming will work when forced to
   move from one CS to another.  Note that, at this phase this issue is
   the out of scope of this draft.  It should be also discussed in 16ng
   WG.

   There are two different deployment scenarios: fixed and mobile
   access.  A fixed access scenario substitudes for existing wired-based
   access technologies such as digital subscriber line (xDSL) and cable
   network.  This fixed access scenario can provide nomadic access
   within the radio coverages, which is called Hot-zone model.  A mobile
   access scenario is for new paradigm for voice, data and video over
   mobile network.  This scenario can provide high speed data rate
   equalivent to wire-based Internet as well as mobility function
   equivalent to cellular system.  The mobile access scenario can be
   classified into two different IPv6 sunbet models: shared IPv6 prefix
   link model and point-to-point link model.

2.2.1.  Mobile Access Deployment Scenarios

   Unlike IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16 BS can offer mobility function as
   well as fixed communication.  [IEEE802.16e] has been standardized to
   provide mobility features on IEEE 802.16 environments.  This use case
   will be implemented only with the licensed spectrum.  IEEE 802.16 BS

   might be deployed with a proprietary backend managed by an operator.
   All original IPv6 functionalities [RFC2461], [RFC2462] will not
   survive.  Some architectural characteristics of IEEE 802.16 networks
   may affect the detailed operations of NDP [RFC2461].

   There are two possible IPv6 subnet models for mobile access
   deployment scenarios: shared IPv6 prefix link model and point-to-
   point link model [I-D.madanapalli-16ng-subnet-model-analysis].  The
   mobile access deployment models, WiMax and WiBro, fall within this
   deployment model.

   1.  Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model

   This link model represents IEEE 802.16 mobile access network
   deployment where a subnet consists of only single interface of AR and
   multiple MSs.  Therefore, all MSs and corresponding interface of AR
   share the same IPv6 prefix as shown in Figure 2.  IPv6 prefix will be
   different from the interface of AR.

                  Figure 2: Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model

   2.  Point-to-Point Link Model

   This link model represents IEEE 802.16 mobile access network
   deployment where a subnet consists of only single AR, BS and MS.
   That is, each connection to a mobile node is treated as a single
   link.  Each link between the MS and the AR is allocated a separate,
   unique prefix or unique set of prefixes by the AR.  The point-to-
   point link model follows the recommendations of [RFC3314].

                    Figure 3: Point-to-Point Link Model

2.2.1.1.  IPv6 Related Infrastructure Changes

   IPv6 will be deployed in this scenario by upgrading the following
   devices to dual-stack: MS, BS, AR and ER.  In this scenario, IEEE
   802.16 BSs have only MAC and PHY layers without router function and
   operates as a bridge.  The BS does not need to support IPv6.
   However, if IPv4 stack is loaded to them for management and
   configuration purpose, it is expected that BS should be upgraded by
   implementing IPv6 stack, too.

2.2.1.2.  Addressing

   IPv6 MS has two possible options to get an IPv6 address.  These
   options will be equally applied to the other scenario below (Section
   2.2.2).

   1.  IPv6 MS can get the IPv6 address from an access router using
   stateless auto-configuration.  In this case, router discovery and DAD
   operation should be properly operated over IEEE 802.16 link.

   2.  IPv6 MS can use DHCPv6 to get an IPv6 address from the DHCPv6
   server.  In this case, the DHCPv6 server would be located in the
   service provider core network and the AR should provide DHCPv6 relay
   agent.  This option is similar to what we do today in case of DHCPv4.

   In this scenario, a router and multiple BSs form an IPv6 subnet and a
   single prefix is allocated to all the attached MSs.  All MSs attached
   to same AR can be on same IPv6 link.

   As for the prefix assignment, in case of shared IPv6 prefix link
   model, one or more IPv6 prefixes are assigned to the link and hence
   shared by all the nodes that are attached to the link.  In point-to-



Shin, et al.              Expires April 4, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        October 2006


   point link model, the AR assigns a unique prefix or set of unique
   prefixes for each MS.

2.2.1.3.  IPv6 Transport

   In a subnet, there are always two underlying links: one is the IEEE
   802.16 wireless link between MS and BS, and the other is a wired link
   between BS and AR.  The IPv6 packet should be classified by IPv6
   source/destination addresses, etc.  BS generates the flow based on
   the classification.  It also decides where to send the packet or just
   forward the packet to the ACR, since IEEE 802.16 connection always
   ends at BS while IPv6 connection terminates at the AR.  This
   operation may be dependent on IPv6 subnet models.

   If stateless auto-configuration is used to get an IPv6 address,
   router discovery and DAD operation should be properly operated over
   IEEE 802.16 link.  In case of shared IPv6 prefix link model, the DAD
   [RFC2461] does not adapt well to the 802.16 air interface as there is
   no native multicast support and when supported consumes air bandwidth
   as well as it would have adverse effect on MSs that were in the
   dormant mode.  An optimization, called Relay DAD, may be required to
   perform DAD.  However, in case of point-to-point link model, DAD is
   easy since each connection to a MN is treated as a unique IPv6 link.

   Note that in this scenario IPv6 CS may be more appropriate than
   Ethernet CS to transport IPv6 packets, since there are some overhead
   of Ethernet CS (e.g., Ethernet header) under mobile access
   environments .

   Simple or complex network equipments may constitute the underlying
   wired network between the AR and the ER.  If the IP aware equipments
   between the AR and the ER do not support IPv6, the service providers
   can deploy IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling mechanisms to transport IPv6
   packets between the AR and the ER.

   The service providers are deploying tunneling mechanisms to transport
   IPv6 over their existing IPv4 networks as well as deploying native
   IPv6 where possible.  Native IPv6 should be preferred over tunneling
   mechanisms as native IPv6 deployment option might be more scalable
   and provide required service performance.  Tunneling mechanisms
   should only be used when native IPv6 deployment is not an option.
   This can be equally applied to other scenario below (Section 2.2.2).

2.2.1.4.  Routing

   In general, the MS is configured with a default route that points to
   the the AR.  Therefore, no routing protocols are needed on the MS.
   The MS just sends to the AR by default route.



Shin, et al.              Expires April 4, 2007                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        October 2006


   The AR can configure multiple link to ER for network reliability.
   The AR should support IPv6 routing protocol such as OSPFv3 [RFC2740]
   or IS-IS for IPv6 when connected to the ER with multiple links.

   The ER runs the IGP such as OSPFv3 or IS-IS for IPv6 in the service
   provider network.  The routing information of the ER can be
   redistributed to the AR.  Prefix summarization should be done at the
   ER.

2.2.1.5.  Mobility

   As for mobility management, the movement between BSs is handled by
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], if it requires a subnet change.  Also, in
   certain cases (e.g., fast handover [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-
   rfc4068bis]) the link mobility information must be available for
   facilitating layer 3 handoff procedure.

   Mobile IPv6 defines that movement detection uses Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection to detect when the default router is no
   longer bi-directionally reachable, in which case the mobile node must
   discover a new default router.  Periodic Router Advertisements for
   reachability and movement detection may be unnecessary because IEEE
   802.16 MAC provides the reachability by its Ranging procedure and the
   movement detection by the Handoff procedure.

   IEEE 802.16 defines L2 triggers whether refresh of an IP address is
   required during the handoff.  Though a handoff has occurred, an
   additional router discovery procedure is not required in case of
   intra-subnet handoff.  Also, faster handoff may be occurred by the L2
   trigger in case of inter-subnet handoff.

   Also, IEEE 802.16g which is under-developed defines L2 triggers for
   link status such as link-up, link-down, handoff-start.  These L2
   triggers may make Mobile IPv6 procedure more efficient and faster.
   In addition, Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover assumes the support from link-
   layer technology, but the particular link-layer information being
   available, as well as the timing of its availability (before, during
   or after a handover has occurred), differs according to the
   particular link-layer technology in use.  This issue is also being
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fh80216e].

2.2.2.  Fixed/Nomadic Deployment Scenarios

   The IEEE 802.16 access networks can provide plain Ethernet
   connectivity end-to-end.  Wireless DSL deployment model is an example
   of a fixed/nomadic IPv6 deployment of IEEE 802.16.  Many wireless
   Internet service providers (Wireless ISPs) have planned to use IEEE
   802.16 for the purpose of high quality broadband wireless service.  A

   company can use IEEE 802.16 to build up mobile office.  Wireless
   Internet spreading through a campus or a cafe can be also implemented
   with it.  The distinct point of this use case is that it can use
   unlicensed (2.4 & 5 GHz) band as well as licensed (2.6 & 3.5GHz)
   band.  By using the unlicensed band, an IEEE 802.16 BS might be used
   just as a wireless switch/hub which a user purchases to build a
   private wireless network in his/her home or laboratory.

   Under fixed access model, the IEEE 802.16 BS will be deployed using
   an IP backbone rather than a proprietary backend like cellular
   systems.  Thus, many IPv6 functionalities such as [RFC2461],
   [RFC2462] will be preserved when adopting IPv6 to IEEE 802.16
   devices.

   This scenario also represents IEEE 802.16 network deployment where a
   subnet consists of multiple MSs and multiple interface of the
   multiple BSs.  Multiple access routers can exist.  There exist
   multiple hosts behind an SS (networks behind an MS may exist).  When
   802.16 access networks are widely deployed like WLAN, this case
   should be also considered.  Hot-zone deployment model falls within
   this case.

      Figure 5: Integration of 802.16 access into DSL infrastructure

   In this approach the 802.16 BS is acting as a DSLAM (Digital
   Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer).  On the network side, the BS is
   connected to an Ethernet bridge which can be separate equipment or
   integrated into BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server).

2.2.2.1.  IPv6 Related Infrastructure Changes

   IPv6 will be deployed in this scenario by upgrading the following
   devices to dual-stack: MS, BS, AR and ER.  In this scenario, IEEE
   802.16 BSs have only MAC and PHY layers without router function and
   operates as a bridge.  The BS does not need to support IPv6.
   However, if IPv4 stack is loaded to them for management and
   configuration purpose, it is expected that BS should be upgraded by
   implementing IPv6 stack, too.

   The BRAS in Figure 4 is providing the functionality of the AR.  The
   Ethernet bridge is necessary for protecting the BRAS from 802.16 link
   layer peculiarities.  The Ethernet bridge relays all traffic received
   through BS to its network side port(s) connected to BRAS.  Any
   traffic received from BRAS is relayed to appropriate BS.  Since
   802.16 MAC layer has no native support for multicast (and broadcast)
   in the uplink direction, the Ethernet bridge will emulate Ethernet
   level multicast (and broadcast) by relaying the multicast frame
   received from the MS to all of its ports.  Ethernet bridge may also
   provide some IPv6 specific functions to increase link efficiency of
   the 802.16 radio link (see Section 2.2.2.3).

2.2.2.2.  Addressing

   One or more IPv6 prefixes can be shared to all the attached MSs.
   Prefix delegation can be required since networks can exist behind SS.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        October 2006


2.2.2.3.  IPv6 Transport

   Note that in this scenario Ethernet CS may be more appropriate than
   IPv6 CS to transport IPv6 packets, since the scenario need to support
   plain Ethernet connectivity end-to-end.  However, the IPv6 CS can
   also be supported.  Every MS and the BS has the Ethernet type MAC
   address.  If the MS is using IP CS, then the BS needs to take care of
   the Ethernet header.  In the upstream direction, the BS will need to
   generate an appropriate Ethernet header and prepend it to the IP
   datagram.  In the downstream direction, the BS will use the
   destination address from the Ethernet header to identify the MS and
   then it will strip the Ethernet header before relaying the IP
   datagram over the 802.16 MAC connection.  Ethernet bridge may provide
   implementation of authoritative address cache and Relay DAD.
   Authoritative address cache is a mapping between the IPv6 address and
   the MAC addresses of all attached MSs.

   The bridge builds its authoritative address cache by parsing the IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery messages used during address configuration (DAD).
   Relay DAD means that the Neighbor Solicitation message used in DAD
   process will be relayed only to the MS which already has configured
   the solicited address as its own address (if such MS exist at all).

2.2.2.4.  Routing

   In this scenario, IPv6 multi-homing considerations exist.  For
   example, if there exist two routers to support MSs, default router
   must be selected.

   The Edge Router runs the IGP used in the SP network such as OSPFv3
   [RFC2740] or IS-IS for IPv6.  The connected prefixes have to be
   redistributed.  Prefix summarization should be done at the Edge
   Router.

2.2.2.5.  Mobility

   No mobility functions are supported in fixed access scenario.
   However, mobility can support in the radio coverage without any
   mobility protocol like WLAN technology.  Therefore, a user can access
   Internet nomadically in the coverage.

2.3.  IPv6 Multicast

   In IEEE 802.16 air link, downlink connections can be shared among
   multiple MSs, enabling multicast channels with multiple MSs receiving
   the same information from the BS.  MBS may be used to efficiently
   implement multicast.  However, it is not clear how to do this, as
   currently CID is assigned by BS, but in MBS it should be done at an



Shin, et al.              Expires April 4, 2007                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        October 2006


   AR and it's network scope.  For MBS how this mapping will happen is
   not clear, so MBS discussions have been postponed in WiMax for now.
   Note that it should be intensively researched later, since MBS will
   be one of the killer services in IEEE 802.16 networks.

   In order to support multicast services in IEEE 802.16, Multicast
   Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC2710] must be supported between the MS
   and AR.  Also, the inter-working with IP multicast protocols and
   Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS) should be considered.

   MBS defines Multicast and Broadcast Services, but actually, MBS seems
   to be a broadcast service, not multicasting.  MBS adheres to
   broadcast services, while traditional IP multicast schemes define
   multicast routing using a shared tree or source-specific tree to
   deliver packets efficiently.

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, two types of access to MBS may be supported:
   single-BS access and multi-BS access.  Therefore, these two types of
   services may be roughly mapped into Source-Specific Multicast.

2.4.  IPv6 QoS

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, a connection is unidirectional and has a QoS
   specification.  The QoS has different semantics with IP QoS (e.g.,
   diffserv).  Mapping CID to Service Flow IDentifier (SFID) defines QoS
   parameters of the service flow associated with that connection.  In
   order to interwork with IP QoS, IP QoS (e.g., diffserv, or flow label
   for IPv6) mapping to IEEE 802.16 link specifics should be provided.

2.5.  IPv6 Security

   When initiating the connection, an MS is authenticated by the AAA
   server located at its service provider network.  All the parameters
   related to authentication (username, password and etc.) are forwarded
   by the BS to the AAA server.  The AAA server authenticates the MSs
   and once authenticated.  When an MS is once authenticated and
   associated successfully with BS, IPv6 address will be acquired by the
   MS with stateless autoconfiguration or DHCPv6.  Note the initiation
   and authentication process is the same as used in IPv4.

   IPsec is a fundamental part of IPv6.  Unlike IPv4, IPsec for IPv6 may
   be used within the global end-to-end architecture.  But, we don't
   have PKIs across organizations and IPsec isn't integrated with IEEE
   802.16 network mobility management.

   IEEE 802.16 network threats may be different from IPv6 and IPv6
   transition threat models [I-D.ietf-v6ops-security-overview].  It
   should be also discussed.

2.6.  IPv6 Network Management

   For IPv6 network management, the necessary instrumentation (such as
   MIBs, NetFlow Records, etc) should be available.

   Upon entering the network, an MS is assigned three management
   connections in each direction.  These three connections reflect the
   three different QoS requirements used by different management levels.
   The first of these is the basic connection, which is used for the
   transfer of short, time-critical MAC management messages and radio
   link control (RLC) messages.  The primary management connection is
   used to transfer longer, more delay-tolerant messages such as those
   used for authentication and connection setup.  The secondary
   management connection is used for the transfer of standards-based
   management messages such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).

   IPv6 based IEEE 802.16 network can be managed by IPv4 or IPv6 when
   network elements are implemented dual stak.  For example, network
   management system (NMS) can send SNMP message by IPv4 with IPv6
   related object identifier.  Also, an NMS can use IPv6 for SNMP
   request and response including IPv4 related OID.
