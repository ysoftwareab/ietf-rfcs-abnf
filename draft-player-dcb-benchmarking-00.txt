Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                 August 2009


Abstract

   Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption that
   networking devices will drop network traffic at their performance
   limits.  Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however, will attempt to
   throttle network endpoints before those limits are reached in order
   to minimize the probability of frame loss in the network.  Hence,
   existing methodologies based around frame loss are inappropriate for
   DCB devices.  This document takes the basic benchmarking ideas based
   on loss and extends them to support "lossless" Ethernet devices.

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                 August 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document is intended to provide a methodology for benchmarking
   Data Center Ethernet (DCB) switching devices that support Priority-
   based Flow Control (PFC) as defined in [802.1Qbb].  It extends the
   methodologies already defined in [RFC2544] and [RFC2889].

   This RFC primarily deals with devices that use priority-based flow
   control (PFC), as defined in [802.1Qbb], to actively manage the
   transmission rate of network endpoints in order to minimize
   forwarding delay and frame loss.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  General Considerations

3.1.  Test Traffic

   The lock-step traffic pattern, as described in section 5.1.3 of
   [RFC2889], is specifically NOT required for DCB testing for two
   reasons:

   1.  Such patterns are unrealistic for high speed Ethernet devices due
       to the transmission clock variance allowed by the IEEE 802.3
       Ethernet specification.

   2.  Flow control mechanisms would quickly break such patterns when
       activated.

4.  Terminology

   As the terminology used by [RFC4689] is specific to IP layer testing,
   a number of existing terms require clarification when used in the DCB
   benchmarking context.  Additionally, a number of new terms are also
   presented to clarify concepts not clearly defined within the scope of
   [RFC4689].

      Classification: As stated in [RFC4689], the selection of packets
      according to defined rules.  In the context of DCB benchmarking,
      the Classification criterion is the value of the 802.1p priority
      code point field in the 802.1Q VLAN header of an Ethernet frame.

      Classification Group: A collection of traffic streams that belong
      to a single Classification.  A Conformance Vector MAY be
      associated with a Classification Group.

      Classification Profile: The set of all Classification Groups
      involved in a benchmarking test.

      Conformance Vector: A set of measurable stream result bounds, e.g.
      latency, jitter, sequencing, etc., that specify whether a frame is
      Conformant or Nonconformant.

      Congestion Management: In the context of DCB benchmarking,
      Congestion Management occurs when the DUT/SUT transmits priority-
      based flow control (PFC) Pause frames.

      Forwarding Congestion: In the context of DCB benchmarking,
      Forwarding Congestion is extended to include PFC pause frame
      transmissions from the DUT.

      Intended Load: In this document, the Intended Load refers to the
      summation of the Intended Vectors for all Classification Groups.

      Offered Load: In this document, the Offered Load refers to the
      summation of the Offered Vectors for all Classification Groups.

      Queue Congestion: Queue congestion occurs when a DUT/SUT uses
      Congestion Management on a discrete set of code points.  The
      congestion managed code points correspond to the congested queue
      in the DUT/SUT.

      Queueput: The maximum Offered Load than can be transmitted into a
      DUT/SUT such that every transmitted frame matches a specific
      Classification rule, the DUT/SUT does NOT use priority-based flow
      control mechanisms to manage the ingress traffic rate, and all
      ingress frames are forwarded to the correct egress port.  A DUT

      may have a different Queueput rate for each configured
      Classification.

5.  Test Setup

   This document extends the general test setup described in section 3
   of [RFC2889] and section 6 of [RFC2544] to the benchmarking of Data
   Center Ethernet switching devices.  [RFC2889] and [RFC2544] describe
   benchmarking methodologies for networking devices that intentionally
   drop frames at their performance limits.  In DCB networks, the DUT
   will transmit PFC Pause frames as a Congestion Management method to
   throttle network endpoints, thus minimizing the probability of frame
   loss in the network.

5.1.  Test Traffic

5.1.1.  Traffic Classification

   Since DCB devices are expected to support multiple traffic
   Classifications, it is RECOMMENDED to benchmark DCB devices with
   multiple Classification Groups.

5.1.2.  Traffic Generation

   When generating multiple traffic classifications from the same test
   port, traffic from each class MUST be interleaved in a round-robin
   fashion.

5.1.3.  Trial Duration

   The recommended trial duration is 300 seconds, however other
   durations MAY be used.  Additionally, a running trial MAY be aborted
   once the test tool can tell that the currently running trial has
   failed.  Two examples would be if a frame does not conform to the
   Conformance Vector of that frame's Classification Group, or if the
   test tool detects loss on a lossless queue.

5.1.4.  Frame Formats

   This testing document does not mandate the use of any particular
   frame format for testing.  Any frame that can be legally forwarded by
   the DUT/SUT MAY be used provided that the test instrument can make
   the following distinctions for each frame:

   1.  The test tool MUST be able to distinguish test frames from non-
       test frames.

   2.  The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each test frame
       is forwarded to the correct egress port.

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                 August 2009


   3.  The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each received
       frame conforms or does not conform to the Conformance Vector of
       the frame's Classification Group.

5.1.5.  Frame Measurements

   Packet Conformance MUST be determined for each and every test frame.
   The method specified for measuring Latency in [RFC2544], e.g.
   measuring the latency of a single test frame in a traffic flow, is
   unsuitable for DCB benchmarking.

5.1.5.1.  Forwarding Delay and Latency

   Multiple methods exist for measuring the time it takes a test frame
   to be forwarded by a DUT.  However, both of the methods discussed in
   [RFC1242] are unsuitable for testing DCB devices, as many DCB devices
   alternate between both "store and forwarding" and "bit forwarding"
   behavior depending upon their queue congestion state.  Hence, the
   only recommended method for measuring the time it takes a DUT to
   forward a test frame is "Forwarding Delay" as described in [RFC4689].

5.1.6.  Frame Sizes

5.1.6.1.  Ethernet

   The recommended frame sizes for Ethernet testing are 64, 128, 256,
   512, 1024, 1280, 1518, 4096, 8192, and 9216 as per [RFC5180].  Note
   that this frame size includes the Ethernet CRC.  This frame size MUST
   include a VLAN header, since [802.1Qbb] requires the use of VLAN
   priority code points to distinguish different Classification Groups.

5.1.6.1.1.  Fibre Channel over Ethernet

   FCoE test traffic introduces a number of frame size constraints that
   make the default frame sizes specified in [RFC5180] unusable:

   1.  FCoE frames contain an encapsulated Fibre Channel frame.  Due to
       the method of encapsulation used, all FCoE frames MUST be a
       multiple of 4 bytes.  See [RFC3643].

   2.  Test tools may need to include a test payload in addition to the
       encapsulated Fibre Channel frame in order to meet the
       requirements specified in Section 5.1.4.

   3.  The maximum supported frame size for FCoE is 2176 bytes.

   Due to these constraints, the recommended frame sizes for FCoE
   testing are 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1520, 2176, and the smallest

   FCoE frame size supported by the test tool.  This frame size MUST
   include a VLAN header, since [802.1Qbb] requires the use of VLAN
   priority code points to distinguish different Classification Groups.

6.  Benchmarking Tests

6.1.  Queueput

6.1.1.  Objective

   To determine the Queueput for one or more Traffic Classifications for
   a DUT using priority-based flow control.

6.1.2.  Setup Parameters

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.6x for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  A burst
         size of 1 specifies a constant load.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector SHOULD specify the
         intended rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port
         load.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector is optional, but
         must be defined if used.

      Priority-based flow control - PFC mechanisms MUST be enabled.

      Background Traffic - Background traffic MAY be present.

6.1.3.  Procedure

   A search algorithm is used to determine the Queueput for each
   Classification Group.  If Queue Congestion is detected for a
   Classification Group during a trial, then the Intended Vector for the
   Classification Group MUST be reduced for the subsequent trial.  If a
   Conformance Vector is specified for the test and nonconformant frames
   are received during a trial, then the Intended Vector SHOULD be
   reduced for the subsequent trial.  The algorithm MUST adjust the
   Intended Vector for each Classification Group.  The search algorithms
   for each Classification Group MAY be run in parallel.  The test

   continues until all Classification Groups in the test have converged
   on a discrete Queueput value.

6.1.4.  Measurements

   The Queueput for each Classification SHOULD be reported in either
   frames or bits per second.

   If a Conformance Vector is specified for a Classification Group, the
   percentage of conformant frames SHOULD be reported.

   Set MUST be reported.

6.1.5.  Reporting Format

   TBD

6.2.  Maximum Forwarding Rate

6.2.1.  Objective

   To determine the maximum forwarding rate of one or more PFC queues on
   a PFC capable DUT.

6.2.2.  Setup Parameters

   Maximum Forwarding Rate is conceptually similar to the measurement in
   [RFC2285] but works on a per-Classification basis in a DCB context.
   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.6 for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  A burst
         size of 1 specifies a constant load.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector includes the intended
         rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port load.

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                 August 2009


         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector includes all QoS
         bounds required for this traffic group.

      Priority-based flow control - priority-based flow control
      mechanisms MAY be enabled or disabled.

      Background Traffic - Background traffic MAY be present.

6.2.3.  Procedure

   The tester should iterate across all configured permutations of frame
   size, burst size, and Intended Vector for all Classification Groups.

6.2.4.  Measurements

   The forwarding rate of each Classification Group SHOULD be reported
   as the number of test frames per second or bits per second the DUT
   correctly forwards to the proper egress port.

   The maximum forwarding rate for each Classification Group MUST be
   reported as the highest recorded forwarding rate from the set of all
   iterations.

   Both the Intended and Offered Vector of each Classification Group
   MUST be reported.

   The number of PFC Pause frames received for each Classification MUST
   be reported.

   If a Conformance Vector is specified for a Classification Group, the
   percentage of conformant frames SHOULD be reported.

6.2.5.  Reporting Format

   TBD

6.3.  Back-off

6.3.1.  Objective

   To determine the delta between the maximum forwarding rate of a DUT
   and the point where the DUT ceases to use PFC to manage priority
   queues.

6.3.2.  Setup Parameters

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                 August 2009


      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.6 for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  A burst
         size of 1 specifies a constant load.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector includes the intended
         rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port load.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector includes all QoS
         bounds required for this traffic group.

      Priority-based flow control - priority-based flow control
      mechanisms MUST be enabled.

      Backoff method - The recommended backoff method is to reduce the
      aggregate traffic load by a fixed amount while still maintaining a
      fixed load ratio between all Classification Groups.

6.3.3.  Procedure

   The initial trial SHOULD begin with an Intended Load equal or greater
   than the Maximum Forwarding Rate of the DUT/SUT.  For each subsequent
   trial, the aggregate load is reduced until the DUT is observed to
   complete a trial without activating any Congestion Management
   methods.

6.3.4.  Measurements

   The Intended and Offered Vector for each Classification Group MUST be
   reported.

   The number of PFC Pause frames received for each Classification Group
   MUST be reported.

   If a Conformance Vector is specified for a Classification Group, the
   percentage of conformant frames SHOULD be reported.

6.3.5.  Reporting Format

6.4.  Back-to-Back

6.4.1.  Objective

   To determine the maximum burst size a DUT handle on one or more PFC
   queues.

6.4.2.  Setup Parameters

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.6 for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  A burst
         size of 1 specifies a constant load.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector includes the intended
         rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port load.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector includes all QoS
         bounds required for this traffic group.

      Priority-based flow control - priority-based flow control
      mechanisms MAY be enabled or disabled.

      The sum of all Intended Vectors on a transmitting port SHOULD
      equal the Maximum Offered Load (MOL) of that port.

6.4.3.  Procedure

   A search algorithm is used to determine the maximum duration in
   seconds for which the configured Classification Profile can be
   forwarded by the DUT without active Congestion Management.  If
   Congestion Management is detected during an iteration, then the
   duration MUST be reduced for the next iteration.

6.4.4.  Measurements

   The Intended and Offered Vector for each Classification Group MUST be
   reported.

   The number of PFC Pause frames received for each Classification Group
   MUST be reported.

   If a Conformance Vector is specified for a Classification Group, the
   percentage of conformant frames SHOULD be reported.

6.4.5.  Reporting Format

7.  Security Considerations

   A broken PFC implementation could lead to hypothetical denial-of-
   service attacks where a DUT ignores PFC pause frames and incorrectly
   forwards traffic as a result, or conversely throttles traffic even
   though no congestion condition exists.  However, the test networks
   described in Benchmarking Methodology Working Group documents
   generally SHOULD NOT be reachable by anyone other than the tester(s).
   The security implications of such incorrect PFC handling are beyond
   the scope of this performance-measurement document, which is intended
   for testing purposes in controlled lab conditions.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Testers SHOULD use network addresses assigned by IANA for the purpose
   of testing networks.
