INTERNET-DRAFT              DTLS over DCCP                   June 2006





1.        Introduction

   This document describes how to use Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS), as defined in [RFC4347], over the Datagram Congestion Control
   Protocol (DCCP), as defined in [RFC4340].

   DTLS is an extension of Transport Layer Security (TLS, [RFC4346])
   that modifies TLS for use with the unreliable transport protocol UDP.
   TLS is a protocol that allows client/server applications to
   communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
   tampering and message forgery.  DTLS can be viewed as TLS-plus-
   adaptations-for-unreliability.

   DCCP provides an unreliable transport service, similar to UDP, but
   with adaptive congestion control, similar to TCP and SCTP.  DCCP can
   be viewed equally well as either UDP-plus-congestion-control or TCP-
   minus-reliability (although, unlike TCP, DCCP offers multiple
   congestion control algorithms).

2.        Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.        DTLS over DCCP

   The approach here is very straightforward -- DTLS records are
   transmitted in the Application Data fields of DCCP-Data packets.  As
   with any data from user applications, a DCCP implementation MAY
   transparently choose to use DCCP-DataAck packets instead of DCCP-Data
   packets.  Multiple DTLS records MAY be sent in one DCCP-Data packet,
   as long as the resulting packet is within the Path Maximum Transfer
   Unit (PMTU) current in force (see section 3.3 for more information on
   PMTU Discovery).

3.1         DCCP and DTLS Sequence Numbers

   Both DCCP and DTLS use sequence numbers in their packets/records.
   These sequence numbers serve somewhat, but not completely,
   overlapping functions.  Consequently, there is no connection between
   the sequence number of a DCCP packet and the sequence number in a
   DTLS record contained in that packet.

3.2         DCCP and DTLS Connection Handshakes

   Unlike UDP, DCCP is connection-oriented, and has a connection
   handshake procedure that precedes the transmission of DCCP-Data
   packets.  DTLS is also connection-oriented, and has a handshake
   procedure of its own that must precede the transmission of actual
   application information.  Using the rule above of mapping DTLS
   records to DCCP-Data packets, the two handshakes must happen in
   series, with the DCCP handshake first, followed by the DTLS
   handshake.

   However, the DCCP handshake packets DCCP-Request and DCCP-Response
   have Application Data fields and can carry user data during the DCCP
   handshake.  DTLS implementations MAY choose to transmit the
   ClientHello message in DCCP-Request packets and the
   HelloVerifyRequest message DCCP-Response packets.

   Subsequent DTLS handshake messages, and retransmissions of the
   ClientHello message, if necessary, must wait for the completion of
   the DCCP handshake.

3.3         PMTU Discovery

   Each DTLS record must fit within a single DCCP-Data packet.  DCCP
   packets are normally transmitted with the DF (Don’t Fragment) bit set
   for IPv4, and of course all IPv6 packets are unfragmentable.  Because
   of this, DCCP performs Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU)
   Discovery.  In determining the maximum size for DTLS records, a DTLS
   over DCCP implementation SHOULD use the DCCP-managed value for PMTU.
   A DTLS over DCCP implementation MAY choose to use its own PMTU
   Discovery calculations, as described in [RFC4347], but MUST NOT use a
   value greater the value determined by DCCP.

4.        Security Considerations

   Security considerations for DTLS are described in [RFC4347] and for
   DCCP in [RFC4340].  The combination of DTLS and DCCP introduces no
   new security considerations.

5.        IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions required for this document.
