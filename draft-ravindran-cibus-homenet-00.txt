           Contextualized Information-Centric Home Networking
                    draft-ravindran-cibus-homenet-00

Abstract

   Home network (Homenet) is a good application scenario for ICN
   considering it is a point where diverse users, devices, applications,
   and services meet.  Homenets are getting increasingly complex with
   the presence of application specific sensors, smart appliances, and
   smart networking devices such as residential gateway.  Home
   automation today is being driven by several alliances such as DLNA,
   AllJoyn, ZigBee, and Z-Wave aimed at supporting homenet services such
   as multimedia sharing, lighting control, climate control, and energy
   management.  These standards overlay application semantics over a
   host centric architectures which is inefficient, and the lack of
   inter- operability among these standards results in high cost,
   inflexibility, and inter-operability issues.  Homenet is an
   information-centric environment where the objective is to enable
   consumers and producers to interact in a contextual manner
   independent of their underlying topology arrangement.  Although the
   overall homenet objectives over an ICN framework versus any other are
   the same; ICN can distinguish itself by providing a rich service
   abstraction layer applicable in local scale as in BAN/PAN/LAN, and
   also enable intelligent interaction beyond the homenet boundary.

   In this draft we share the idea of a contextualized information-
   centric bus (CIBUS) which builds over ICN abstraction of naming, name
   resolution, and content dissemination for home network by providing
   support for service management, context processing and monitoring,
   policy management, and policy based routing and forwarding.  CIBUS
   allows applications and services to discover each other, subscribe/
   notify to event upon which service composition can be realized
   locally or in a centralize manner.  Furthermore, service policies can
   be applied at high granularity which can be imposed in the routing
   and forwarding plane through ICN extensions.  Some of these CIBUS
   features that were realized in [5] is presented here.

1.  Introduction

   During the past decade, many standalone Internet of Things (IoT)
   systems have been developed and deployed in different application
   domains such as homenets, smart grid, smart transportation, and
   health care.  Home networks will see continuous evolution in this
   regard, as users introduce heterogeneous devices to access various
   services ranging from well known ones like entertainment, climate
   control, security surveillance to more personal conveniences like
   digitization of wine cellars etc.  The requirements in this case is
   diverse, ranging from accommodating diverse devices, radio
   interfaces, service requirements, and policy control.  Here we
   propose CIBUS, which leverages ICN semantics to allow seamless
   interaction among devices and services while being contextually
   sensitive to realize residents requirements for service composition
   and strict policy control.

2.  Homenet Challenges

   Several studies, such as [4][3], have elaborated home automation
   challenges, important ones include:

   1) Historically, the cost of installation and maintenance deter any
   incremental addition of new services, economy of scale through mass
   technology adoption shall address this.

   2) Complexity due to variety of standards and lack of inter-
   operability of devices where the services may have to hop between
   multiple protocols requiring gateways to handle protocol translation
   functions, standardization on a single application-centric platform
   leveraging cheap computing, caching, and storage that meets
   heterogenous needs is the need here.

   3) Poor manageability in terms of customizing services to user
   requirements due to complex realization of the home automation
   systems particularly if heterogeneous systems are in place,
   addressing (1) and (2) shall make this feasible.

   Though these are subjective concerns, the underlying technology
   determines how efficiently these challenges are addressed, towards
   this ICN has a unique opportunity to show its value where features

Internet-Draft                CIBUS-Homenet                February 2014


   like name based routing augmented with contextual expression, and
   leveraging distributed caching/computing resources shall address
   these challenges uniquely under an ICN paradigm.

   Considering these challenges, following are requirements for a
   homenet:

2.1.  Agile Service Management

   Homenet services are hosted by heterogeneous devices and connectivity
   that generate information with different policy management
   requirements.  Hence, services can be dynamically configurable in
   terms of related parameter such as scope of reachability, service
   lifetime, and accessibility by users or by other services anytime
   during its lifetime.  Furthermore, services shall be able to leverge
   each other, hence service composition among multiple services shall
   be integral to the design and realiazable with minimum overhead while
   adhering to individual service policy requirements.  Also flexibility
   is required to introduce services dynamically in a homenet such as by
   the home operator or ISP or by a third party, with its own policy
   requirements.

2.2.  Self Configuration

   Considering the heterogeneity of devices and naive home users,
   homenet platform is expected to be a zero configuration environment
   with auto- node and service discovery to simple management interface
   for service composition with little human interventation.  Self-
   configuration shall be achieveable in ad hoc or infrastructure
   envrionments.  Infrastructure support is required particularly for
   global service reachability.  Furthermore, self healing due to
   wireless or network layer impairment by taking advantage of multi-
   path routing and caching in the homenet shall preserve user QoE even
   during network disruptions.

2.3.  End-to-end Homogenous Platform

   To support a heterogeneous device environment, a platform which can
   accommodate disparate devices, radio connectivity, and protocol
   semantic for information exchange is required.  The platform itself
   shall be amenable to diverse conditions such as for both
   unconstrained and constrained segments while supporting different
   modes of communication such as M:M, 1:M, and M:1.  Further the
   platform shall also be extendible outside the home environment to
   access or enable in-home service reacheability.

Internet-Draft                CIBUS-Homenet                February 2014


2.4.  Mobility Support

   Mobility support for both service producers and consumers is required
   to ensure best connectivity at all times, particularly in a setup
   with multiple access points in a home network to maximize signal
   quality.  Hence, mobility includes sessionc contiuity during in-home
   movement and due to vertical handovers between different access
   networks as residents and non-residents move in and out of their home
   premise for which the network the ISP may be involved.

2.5.  Security and Trust

   Trust and security is application specific.  Specifically in a home
   scenario considering heterogenous which may also include untrusted
   devices this consideration apply at application, service, device, and
   content level.  Information generated by producers inside homenet is
   expected to be private hence subjected to strict access control, this
   particulaly is very important when home services interact with third
   party applications outside the home domain.

3.  State of the Art

   Over the years, many stand-alone homenet solutions have emerged.
   These systems usually adopt a vertical silo architecture and support
   a small set of the above features.  A recent trend, however, is to
   move away from this approach, towards a unified homenet platform in
   which the existing silo IoT systems, as well as new systems enable
   data and service accessiblity through the general Internet
   applications.  Most of these systems rely on IP to interconnect
   devices hence relying on host-centric model even though data is
   shareable, or context changes can be handled locally without
   involving external centralized systems.  Some of these systems
   include IETF's Homenet effort [2] which is based on IPv6 and AllJoyn
   [1], DLNA alliance with abstraction layer over IP.  These systems try
   to evolve existing frameworks missing out intelligence available
   through in-network computing and caching, expoliting multi-path
   routing, or name based security features.  These features are core to
   ICN, which can get us closer to the vision of a of self-organizing
   homenets.

             Figure 1: CIBUS as generic service platform


   A high level view of CIBUS is shown in Fig. 1.  CIBUS serves as a BUS
   for heterogenous consumers and services to interact and exchange
   information.  It primarily enables a service management layer
   spanning the home network, and extending into the Internet, i.e
   interacting with edge service routers [6] or services in the data
   centers.  CIBUS is a generic framework which needn't be just
   restricted to a home network, but span other ecosystems such as smart
   grids, smart transportation too.  CIBUS supports several service
   functions, shown in fig. 2, such as name management, auto- node and
   service discovery, context expression and monitoring, and policy-
   based service publishing and subscription.  Depending on ICN
   functions, functions like content discovery can be features enabled
   through CIBUS or part of ICN layer itself.

       Figure 2: CIBUS functions and CIBUS/ICN API


   CIBUS enable the following features in a home network scenario:

   (1) Being a name based networking architecture, the applications
   requires zero configuration to initiate communication among producers
   and consumers, and topology independent.  However general service
   access over Internet may require ISP support.

   (2) The service management layer allows consumers to discover
   services based on their contexts and policy requiremnents.  A home
   gateway can be the central entity which learns services during the
   discovery process and which allow services to be managed in a
   centralized way.  The service discovery component may also extended
   beyond the homenet [6] to connect ISP or third party services to the
   resident customers.

   (3) With its configuration-less nature, ICN supports various
   communication modes such as 1:M, M:1, and M:M. ICN is also amenable
   to constrained sensor networks which can leverage computing, caching




Ravindran, et al.        Expires August 11, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                CIBUS-Homenet                February 2014


   and storage of the infrastrcture achieving the objective of
   homogenous layer for homenets.

   (4) Being receiver-oriented, ICN allows consumers to express
   contexts, and producers to generate appropriate responses, therefore
   enabling contextual communication, further caching and multi-path
   routing capability enable reliable communication.

   (5) Application and services can express the level of security
   requirement while initating node or service discovery and attachment
   process.  This augments well understood ICN features which integrates
   security during data requests and responses.

   Two high level APIs are identified in Fig. 2.  Following functions
   shall be supported over CIBUS-API:

4.1.  Name Management

   Names can be unique within a local or global scope depending on the
   application or service requirement.  Names can take any form
   permitted by ICN - flat or hierarchical.  Depending on the service
   scope the naming process itself may require interaction with the home
   gateway to ensure global uniqueness.  Furthermore in a home network
   the names could be associated with hierarchy of scopes, as in a room
   context wherein guests could only connect from a specific room, or
   services categorizes as entertainment, climate-control, or security
   so that devices and hosted services consume and generate information
   within that given scope over which desired policies can be applied.

4.2.  Service Publishing

   CIBUS enables services to publish and get discovered or advertise
   themselve considering default or configured policies (e.g. device,
   user, security considerations, usage constraints etc.) by the
   resident owner.  This action the service profile available with API
   definitions to access a particular service feature, such as a
   notification service.  Policies can be granular to the extent of
   making certain services available to certain space in the homenet to
   strict access policies to a set of users.  These policies shall be
   standardized to enable interpretation and desired enforcement by
   CIBUS.  For constrained devices, other smart devices or ICN routers
   in the proximity could play a role to publish services and manage the
   data accessibility.

Internet-Draft                CIBUS-Homenet                February 2014


4.3.  Service Discovery

   Services can be discovered by active probing for nodes and hosted
   services in the vicinity, or by local subscribtion to CIBUS for
   specific services of interest and making it available to applications
   if services themselves broadcast their availability; CIBUS shall
   handle both these possibilities.  This process begins the moment
   device, application, or the user has a context change e.g. moving
   from outside to home environment and in the mode to associate with
   services of interest.  Applications invoke node and service discovery
   by providing specific service name, filters such as context ,
   security or other metadata of interest.  The sevice discovery phase
   can also be used to handle routing with FIB entries pointing to the
   device(s) providing the service, this is feasible in home networks
   considering the topology is generally a tree structure.

4.4.  Service Subscription

   Subscriptions are triggered once an application discovers services of
   interest, and learns about its capabilities.  CIBUS handles this by
   keeping track of consuming applications interested in specific
   service events and notifying those consumers about a new data
   availability, or during a change in context of the service.

4.5.  Service Notification

   Once services bind and valid consuming applications are authorized,
   the next step is to share the data generated by these services.  Data
   can be generated periodically, event triggered, or in real-time due
   to consumer interaction.  Moreover considerations over energy
   efficiency, and overhead concerns is very critical.  In that sense in
   addition to the PULL, PUSH based notification shall be supported
   leveraging underlying ICN semantics.  Content itself can be bound
   with metadata which restricts its usage to only a particular type of
   consuming application which can be enforced during the data
   dissemination process by the ICN layer.

4.6.  Service Policy Management

   Services itself could have many requirements.  Policies includes
   content security or service access policies applicable at various
   level of interaction, such as during discovery/association phase or
   acesss, or during content exchange such as to establish content
   provenance, integrity, or privacy.  Applications express policies in
   a standardized manner to CIBUS which can enforce it during the
   discovery phase or during the above mentioned service management
   tasks.  Policies can be also be enforced as part of the routing and
   forwarding enhancement in the ICN layer.  The policies in a home

Internet-Draft                CIBUS-Homenet                February 2014


   environment is expected to evolve, hence CIBUS shall be adaptable to
   handle this evolution as well.

5.  ICN-API

   ICN-API primitives include the minimum set of APIs required to
   support CIBUS primitives exposed to the application through CIBUS-
   API.  Current understood Interest/Response or Get/Put primitives to
   publish and request content can be extended to execute discovery or
   service management capabilities exposed to the application through
   CIBUS.  For e.g. an action of service discovery in an ad hoc setting
   shall flood the service discovery query over all the radio interface,
   on the other hand Interests for a particular service or content shall
   only processed if service policies understood by ICN are met by the
   consumer Interest.

   Extending a set of well understood contexts and policy functions to
   ICN reduces processing requirement of CIBUS.  Towards this, policy
   aware routing and forwarding in ICN is useful in home setting where
   consumer Interests can be filtered by the ICN nodes even before
   reaching power constrained sensor devices; name based firewall in the
   home gateway is another application of this.  Considering simple tree
   topologies in home network, routing itself can be configured during
   service discovery, with certain contextual policies enabled in the
   forwarding , these policies shall be managed through self-expiry or
   due to explicit action by the service.

6.  CIBUS Prototype

   A subset of the CIBUS features was realized in our prototype [5].
   The prototype setup includes multiple internal routers (IRs) are
   rooted to a home gateway (HGw), and each is deployed with CCNx.  The
   HGw connects to an ISP's provider gateway (PGw).  The IRs provides
   gateway support to connected resource-constrained sensors.  The
   prototype demonstrates the following functionalities: (1) Home-wide
   zero-configuration through name-based neighbor and service discovery
   protocols across router boundary; (2) Context and policy based
   routing and forwarding at the HGw/IRs, where routing tables are set
   as the result of the service discovery protocol; (3) Name-based
   firewall at the HGw, where flows are inspected based on service names
   rather than ports and IP addresses; (4) Layer-2 agnostic operations
   realizing end-to-end ICN operations over any L2 technology.

   Following scenarios as part of the CIBUS realization:

   o  Health Monitoring Service: In this scenario, a consumer discovers
      a health monitoring service through the HGw.  The user then
      subscribes to this service.  The interaction between the consumer

      and the service results in another service instantiation on the
      consumer device, which makes the health monitoring data accessible
      to the healthcare service provider.  The consumer device service
      is published for public access.

   o  Sensor Service: A set of wireless sensor motes are deployed which
      generate data of temperature, light, and humidity.  This data is
      made accessible through a sensor service.  The service is proxied
      by the internal router, and published for public access through
      the HGw.

   o  Trusted D2D Interaction: This application demonstrates ICN-based
      ad hoc trusted and social device-to-device interaction.  Two
      devices discover each other (node discovery) and their services
      through the neighbor and service discovery protocols.  Data access
      is restricted through group-ID based access control, and data
      confidentiality is enforced using a group key.

7.  Conclusion

   ICN enables a rich waist for contextual information exchange.
   Applications require more abstractions to handle efficient
   communication in different environments, for this we propose a
   contextualized information-centric BUS (CIBUS) which spans devices
   and infrastructure both local in homenet and beyond to the Internet.
   CIBUS allows heterogeneous devices, applications, and users to
   participate in context driven conversations in secure and reliable
   manner leveraging ICN features.  In the context of homenets this
   enables several desirable features such as context based service
   publishing and subscription, zero-configuration based node and
   service discovery, and policy based routing and forwarding.
   Furthermore the CIBUS is applicable to both ad hoc and infrastructure
   settings, and can deal with diverse devices and services in or
   outside the home boundary.

   The draft provides fucntional requirements of CIBUS to support the
   heterogeneity in homenets.  Framework realization require
   considerations towards standardized representation of service
   profiles, context expression over CIBUS and ICN APIs to support
   devices, applications, and services.
