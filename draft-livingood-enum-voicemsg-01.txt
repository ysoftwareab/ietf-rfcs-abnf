   This document registers the Enumservice type "voicemsg" with the 
   subtype "sip" using the URI scheme sip, the subtype "tel" using the 
   URI scheme 'tel', the subtype "http" using the URI scheme 'http', and 
   the subtype "https" using the URI scheme 'https' as per the IANA 
   registration process defined in the ENUM specification, RFC 3761.  
   This Enumservice is used to facilitate the real-time routing of voice 
   communications to a voice messaging system.

Internet-Draft           voicemsg Enumservice           September 2007 
 
 
   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a technology that 
   transforms E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication 
   Numbering Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [2]) into domain names and 
   then uses DNS (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [3]) delegation through 
   NS records and NAPTR records (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System 
   (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database, RFC 3403 
   [4]) to look up what services are available for a specific domain 
   name. 
    
   This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines 
   given in RFC 3761 [1] to be used for provisioning in the services 
   field of a NAPTR [4] resource record to indicate the types of 
   functionality associated with an end point and/or telephone number.  
   The registration is defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation 
   Discovery System [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" 
   DDDS Application defined in RFC 3761. 
    
   Voice messaging systems are used widely with telephony and voice 
   communication services.  The need for a voice messaging service type 
   has become clear in order to provide certain applications with direct 
   access to various voice messaging services, for example voicemail, 
   most typically via the use of SIP.   
    
   The authors considered the use of VPIM [11] but found that VPIM was 
   best suited to the non-real-time and non-session-based routing of a 
   voice message once it had been deposited into a voice messaging 
   system.  Thus, VPIM was a good solution for the non-real-time and 
   non-session-based routing of voice messages between and within 
   domains, but it did not enable real-time interaction with a voice 
   messaging system.   
    
   Thus, a need has been identified for this voice messaging service 
   type that would enable, for example some of the following use cases: 
    
   * A called party is busy or does not answer a call. A client or 
   server then determines that a voice messaging service should be used 
   and sends the calling party’s session to such a service. The client 
   or server needs to be able to determine which server to direct this 
   real-time session to, whether that is within or outside of the called 
   party’s domain.   
    
   * Similar to the above use case, a real-time session is attempted to 
   a voice messaging system, but that system is currently unavailable.  
   Since multiple voice messaging service type records may be returned 
   by the original ENUM query, the client or server could then attempt 
   to initiate a session with one or more backup voice messaging servers 
   in a manner which is transparent to the calling party, and which 
   supports better overall availability of a voice messaging service.

   * Similar to the above use case, this voice message service type 
   could be used to balance load across multiple voice messaging 
   servers, whether those are in the same or in different physical 
   locations. 
    
   * A user with an account on a voice messaging service needs to 
   connect to a voice messaging service in order to retrieve voice 
   messages.  They initiate a real-time session and an ENUM query is 
   performed to discover the voice messaging server that holds their 
   mailbox. 
    
   The authors considered whether this service type could simply use the 
   SIP Enumservice type [16], but found that it does not satisfy their 
   voice messaging requirements.  For example, a request for access to 
   such a service could be extended to the requesting SIP client, or 
   User Agent Client (UAC), rather than relying upon the local policy of 
   a SIP server, or User Agent Server (UAS), which means that special 
   routing logic within a UAS cannot be relied upon to solve this 
   problem.  More importantly, however, the authors have found that 
   without this service type, a UAC or UAS will be presented with 
   multiple SIP URIs, with no ability other than in non-standards-based 
   routing rules or application logic to recognize which one is related 
   to a voice messaging service.  This is due in part to the fact that 
   the IANA registration for the SIP Enumservice does not register any 
   subtypes.  
 
3. Distribution of Data 
    
   The authors believe that it is more likely that these records will be 
   distributed on a purely private basis, but they may also be 
   distributed in public ENUM trees. Distribution of this NAPTR data 
   could be either (a) on a private basis (within a service provider's 
   internal network, or on a private basis between one or more parties 
   using a variety of security mechanisms to prohibit general public 
   access) or (b) openly available.

5. Examples 
 
   The following sub-sections document several examples for illustrative 
   purposes.  These examples shall in no way limit the various forms 
   that this Enumservice may take. 
    
5.1 Example of a calling party send to a voice messaging system, Using a 
    'sip' URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:sip" 
      "!^.*$!sip:12155550123@gw.example.com!". 
    
   In this example, a calling party has attempted a session which has 
   gone unanswered after a certain period of time. The calling party’s 
   session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a 
   personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which 
   they record a voice message to the called party. 
    
5.2 Example of a calling party send to a voice messaging system, Using a 
    'tel' URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:tel" 
      "!^.*$!tel:1-215-555-0123!". 
    
   In this example, a calling party has attempted a session which has 
   gone unanswered after a certain period of time.  The calling party’s 
   session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a 
   personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which 
   they record a voice message to the called party. 
    
5.3 Example Using a Regular Expression 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:sip" 
      "!(^.*)$!sip:\1!". 
    
   In this example, a regular expression replacement function is used to 
   reduce the size of the NAPTR record.  The sip URI uses "\1" which 
   would dynamically replace the expression with the TN, in this case 
   +12155550123. 
    
5.4 Example of a calling party send to a voice messaging system, Using a 
    'sip' URI Scheme where the URI does not contain a telephone number 
     
      $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.  
         NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+voicemsg:sip"  
         "!^.*$!sip:johndoe@gw.example.com!".

   In this example, a calling party has attempted a session which has 
   gone unanswered after a certain period of time. The calling party’s 
   session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a 
   personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which 
   they record a voice message to the called party.  The URI that this 
   session is directed to does not include a telephone number, as this 
   user has multiple service that are not particularly tied to telephone 
   numbers whereby text, audio, video and other multimedia messages can 
   be received and accessed. 
 
6. Implementation Recommendations 
 
6.1 Call Processing When Multiple Records Are Returned 
    
   It is likely that that both E2U+sip and E2U+voicemsg Enumservice type 
   records will be returned for a given query. In this case, this could 
   result in what is essentially E2U+sip records for real-time 
   communications with an end user, while the E2U+voicemsg records will 
   be used for real-time communications with a voice messaging service, 
   when the called party is not available or does not wish to be 
   disturbed. Therefore, the network element that receives the results 
   of this ENUM query will need to know enough information in order to 
   select the voicemsg service type, rather than the sip service type. 
    
   In addition, it is likely that multiple E2U+voicemsg Enumservice type 
   records will be returned for a given query. In this case, multiple 
   records may include order and preference to allow recursion or load 
   balancing.  Order could be used to designate a primary and a backup 
   voice messaging service.  Preference could be used to load balance 
   across multiple voice messaging servers by weight. 
    
   Finally, as with multiple records resulting from a typical ENUM query 
   of the e164.arpa tree, it is up to the application using an ENUM 
   resolver to determine which record(s) to use and which record(s) to 
   ignore. Implementers should take this into consideration and build 
   logic into their applications that can select appropriately from 
   multiple records based on business, network, or other rules.   
    
6.2 NAPTR Configuration issues 
    
   Implementers may wish to consider using regular expressions in order 
   to reduce the size of individual NAPTRs.  This will have a 
   significant effect on the overall size of the database involved.   
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database. Should 
   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any other 
 
 
Livingood et. al.       Expires March 14, 2008                [Page 9]

   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining voicemsg 
   Enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone 
   anonymously. While this is not qualitatively different from 
   publication in a Telephone Directory, it does open or ease access to 
   such data without any indication that such data has been accessed or 
   by whom it has been accessed. 
    
   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists 
   of targets for unsolicited information. Thus, a third party could use 
   this to generate a list that they can use to make unsolicited 
   "telemarketing" phone calls, or so-called SPAM over Internet 
   Telephony (SPIT). Many countries have do-not-call registries or other 
   legal or regulatory mechanisms in place to deal with such abuses.   
    
   As noted earlier carriers, service providers, and other users may 
   simply choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa  
   tree, but may instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM 
   routing database that is only able to be queried by trusted elements 
   of their network and/or partner networks, such as softswitches and 
   SIP proxy servers. They may also choose to publish such information 
   in a carrier-only branch of the e164.arpa tree, should one be 
   created. 
    
   Although an E.164 telephone number does not appear to reveal as much 
   identity information about a user as a name in the format 
   sip:username@hostname or email:username@hostname, the information is 
   still publicly available, thus there is still the risk of unwanted 
   communication. 
    
   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS 
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [13] to this is provided in RFC 3761 
   [1].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in 
   RFC 3833 [14]. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document registers the 'voicemsg' Enumservice type and the 
   subtype "tel" and "sip" under the Enumservice registry described in 
   the IANA considerations in RFC 3761.  Details of this registration 
   are provided in Section 4 of this document.
