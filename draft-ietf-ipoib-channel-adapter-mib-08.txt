1. Introduction 
    
   This document defines a MIB for InfiniBand Channel Adapters (CA). 
    
   The InfiniBand Architecture [INFINIV1] (IBA) is defined by the  
   InfiniBand Trade Association.  InfiniBand is designed to provide low 
   latency, high bandwidth interconnect in a computing environment.   
   This document will define the objects related to managing a specific 
   class of InfiniBand nodes called Channel Adapters. 
    
   A Channel Adapter (CA) is the end-point for IBA packets that are sent 
   and received over the IBA switching fabric.  There are two types of  
   CAs: Host Channel Adapters (HCA) and Target Channel Adapters (TCA).  
   Typically, HCAs are used by host processors and TCAs are used by I/O  
   adapters to connect to the IBA switch fabric.  The HCA supports the  
   IBA Verbs layer as the transport layer interface, while the TCA often 
   uses its own implementation-specific interface to the transport  
   layer. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT"

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in  
   this document are to be interpreted as described in  
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
 
 
2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 
    
 
3. Structure of the MIB  
    
   This section describes the structure of the IPOIB CA MIB. 
 
3.1 Overview 
    
   The SNMP management of the CA involves the monitoring of key channel 
   adapter attributes. 
 
3.2  Discussion of MIB Groups 
 
   The CA MIB is divided into two basic groups: MIB objects and the  
   conformance group. 
    
3.3 The CA MIB Objects 
 
   The CA MIB objects correlate to the set of Channel Adapter  
   attributes.  These attributes are organized into three major CA MIB 
   groups. 
    
   These are: the General Channel Adapter Info Group, the Channel  
   Adapter Attributes Info Group, and the Channel Adapter Port  
   Attributes and Gid Info Group. 
    
3.3.1 The General Channel Adapter Info Group 
 
   This group provides general information common to any InfiniBand 
   network entity that contains CAs.  This includes distinguishing

   between the HCA and the TCA, displaying the node GUIDs, and showing 
   the number of ports on each CA. 
 
3.3.2 The Channel Adapter Attributes Info Group 
    
   This group provides more specific information about the CAs on a 
   network entity.  This includes various attribute flags, transport 
   service support, and other CA characteristics. 
    
3.3.3 The Channel Adapter Port Attributes and Gid Info Group 
    
   This group provides information about the CA ports.  This includes 
   the type of physical interfaces supported, other port attributes, 
   and a table containing the port GIDs. 
    
3.4 The CA Conformance Group 
    
   The CA Conformance Group lists the possible compliances for various 
   types of InfiniBand nodes that contain channel adapters.  Currently, 
   two types of compliance are defined: basic and full.  The units of 
   conformance which define the constituent object groups are also 
   listed. 
    
3.4.1 CA Compliance Groups 
    
   The Compliance Groups list acceptable MIB implementation  
   requirements.

      DESCRIPTION 
         "The ibCaPortGidGroup defines the MIB objects that describe 
          attributes about the Channel Adapter port GIDs." 
      ::= { ibCaGroups 4 }

5. Security Considerations 
    
   This memo defines textual conventions and object identities for use 
   in IPOVERIB MIB modules.  Security issues for these MIB modules are  
   addressed in the memos defining those modules.  Because this memo 
   does not define management objects, the memo has no impact on the 
   security of the Internet. 
    
6. IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the transmission 
   branch, that is, assign the infinibandMIB under { transmission 199 }. 
   This sub-id is requested because 199 is the ifType for  
   infiniband(199) and is available under transmission. 
    
   In the future, IPOIB related standards track MIB modules should be 
   rooted under the infinibandMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to  
   manage that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a  
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434]. 
    
   This document also requests IANA to assign { infinibandMIB 4 } to the 
   IB-CA-MIB specified in this document.
