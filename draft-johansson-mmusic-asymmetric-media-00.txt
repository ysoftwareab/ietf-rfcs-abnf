Internet-Draft          Asymmetric Media with SDP               Feb 2009


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes a new session setup attribute to be used when
   negotiating various asymmetric session setups such as tightly coupled
   multiparty multimedia sessions or other situations where the
   participants may have different properties or requirements.  The
   different properties are:

   o  Number of concurrent streams (up and downlink): This may be
      limited by either the link bandwidth or by the processing capacity
      in the terminal.

   o  Number of input/output channels: Depending on e.g user setup and
      rendering capabilities, a device may be setup for mono or
      multichannel audio output.  Furthermore a client may have one
      microphone or a set of microphones in a conference room.

   o  Different quality requirements in each direction: One extreme use
      case could be a mobile user communicating with a peer who is
      connected to a 50" TV set.  In one direction a video bitrate of
      500kbps with CIF resolution may be sufficient while in the other
      direction a bitrate of 5Mbps and 16CIF resolution may be
      desirable.

   o  Different other properties in the two directions: An extreme case
      may be different connections or QoS mechanisms in the two
      directions

   In order to work, the proposed schema strives to isolate the send and
   receive directions where needed and possible.  For obvious reasons
   various multicast scenarios are excluded.

   The framework builds upon the SDP Capability Negotiation framework
   [SDPCapNeg] and the SDP Media capabilities extension [SDPMedCapNeg]
   meaning that it does not work with legacy SDP syntax alone.  Moreover
   the framework goes against some of the design principles in
   [SDPCapNeg].

   o  Configuration : Could be potential, latent or actual configuration
      as described in SDPCapNeg and SDPMedCapNeg.


3.  Description

   To be able to negotiate the media in each direction [SDPCapNeg] with
   [SDPMedCapNeg] are extended with a set of different features
   described below:

   o  The m= parameter is extended with a numerator which defines the
      number of streams of the same media.  For instance "m=1(3),2(1)"
      depicts 3 streams of media 1 and 1 stream of media 2.  Furthermore
      the bandwidth modifiers as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3890] can
      be appended for more efficient bandwidth description than "a=bcap"
      defined in [SDPMiscCapNeg].  Thus "m=1(3),2(1),AS:200" adds the
      information that the bandwidth for this particular alternative is
      200kbps.

   o  A new option tag asym-v0 is introduced, it is RECOMMENDED to put
      this option tag only on the potential, latent and actual
      configurations that actually exploits the extension defined in
      this memo.

   o  Two new parameters "send" and "recv" are introduced, these defines
      the direction of the parameters that follow.  An example pcfg line
      may look like
      "a=pcfg:1 send t=1 m=1(3),2(1),AS:200 pt=1:96,2:97 recv t=1
      m=2,AS:80 pt=2:97"

   o  A selected potential configuration using the extension is not
      realizable using legacy SDP syntax.  This means that the
      requirement in SDPCapNeg that the legacy SDP part of an SDP answer
      MUST reflect the selected potential configuration as legacy SDP is
      changed into a MUST NOT when the option tag asym-v0 is specified.

   o  A consequence of the fact that the extension is no longer
      realizable using legacy SDP syntax is that parameters that are
      described in the attributes defined by SDPCapNeg and its
      extensions need to be modified.  One example in the H.264 case is
      sprop-parameter-sets that is wrapped in the "a=mfcap" attribute by
      the SDPMedCapNeg extension.

   The text below defines the necessary modifications to the [SDPCapNeg]
   framework and the [SDPMedCapNeg] extension.  Parts are stolen with
   pride from the said drafts.

   We define the (modified) media configuration parameter, media-config-

   list, in accordance with the following format:
      ----
      m=<med-cap-list> *["|"<med-cap-list>]

      media-config-list = "m=" med-cap-list *(BAR med-cap-list)
      ; BAR is defined in [SDPCapNeg]
      med-cap-list = med-cap-id *("," med-cap-id) *("," bw-mod)
      med-cap-id = med-cap-num [ "(" med-cap-n-str ")" ]
      med-cap-num = 1*DIGIT[ ; defined in SDP
      med-cap-n-str = 1*DIGIT[ ; defined in SDP
      bw-mod = bandwidth modifiers as described in
        [RFC3550] and [RFC3890]. The modifiers MUST be of the
        form <modifier>:<value>
      ----

   med-cap-num is defined in [SDPMedCapNeg]. med-cap-n-str defines the
   number of streams with the given med-cap-num.  If med-cap-n-str is
   omitted a default value of 1 is assumed. bw-mod are the bandwidth
   modifiers as described in [RFC3550] and [RFC3890].

   We add the direction parameters "send" and "recv" to the potential,
   actual and latent configurations defined in [SDPCapNeg] and
   [SDPMedCapNeg].  The ABNF for the potential configuration will then
   look like :
      ----
      a=pcfg: <config-number> "+asym-v0"
              1*WSP ["send"/"recv" 1*WSP] [<pot-cfg-list>]
             *[1*WSP "send"/"recv" 1*WSP <pot-cfg-list>]

       or for the special symmetric case.
      a=pcfg: <config-number> "+asym-v0" 1*WSP [<pot-cfg-list>]

      for comparison SDPCapNeg (section 3.5.1) specifies:

      a=pcfg: <config-number> [<pot-cfg-list>]
      ----

   Similar for the latent and actual configurations.

   Note that only one occurrence each of "send" and "recv" is allowed
   for each potential configuration.  Note that it is possible to use
   the extended format in a symmetric setup as well.

   Some observations:

   o  For simplicity and to avoid repetitions, the pt= parameter(s) MAY
      be placed in the very beginning of the potential configuration,
      the pt= parameter(s) then applies to both send and recv

      directions.

   o  It is RECOMMENDED to put the option tag for this extended
      formulation on each configuration that makes use of it, this makes
      it possible to define fallback configurations in case the
      extension described in this draft is not supported by the
      endpoints or intermediary nodes.

   An offer may look like
   ----
   a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF
   a=creq:med-v0
   m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 98
   a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1
   a=mcap:1 AMR-WB/16000/1
   a=mcap:2 AMR-WB/16000/2
   a=bcap:1 AS:40
   b=RS:0
   b=RR=2000
   a=pcfg:1 +asym-v0 \
        send t=1 m=1(3),2,AS:200|1(2),2,AS:160|1,2,AS:120 pt=1:96,2:97 \
        recv t=1 m=1,AS:40 pt=1:96
   a=pcfg:2 t=1 m=1 b=1 pt=1:96
   ----

   Meaning that the offerer can send 3, 2, 1 mono streams and 1 stereo
   stream, while it wish to receive only one mono stream.  The
   alternative with the highest number of streams has the highest
   priority as per rules defined in SDPCapNeg.  Note also that the last
   potential configuration does not use the extended asymmetry
   formulation, it serves as a fallback (symmetric) configuration for
   the case that the extension defined in this memo is not supported.

   [Ed.  Note : It is possible to use the a=bcap and b= formulation as
   well, the problem is then that it is necessary to define several
   potential configurations.  In some cases like different connections
   or transports it may be the only good solution however]

   Am SDP answer may look like

   Indicating that the answerer wish to receive 2 mono and 1 stereo
   stream and send 1 mono stream

   [Ed.  Note: It seems reasonable that the bandwidth specifiers
   override the "legacy SDP" bandwidth specifiers for their respective
   direction.  The implications of this is however not fully clear.  For
   backwards compatibility reasons the applicable bandwidth modifiers
   (e.g) "b=AS:..."  SHOULD be specified as legacy SDP parameters as
   well.  It seems in this case reasonable to specify the worst case
   from the listed payload types (TBD).]

   The media direction attribute can inter operate with the a=sendrecv/
   sendonly/recvonly/inactive attributes in the way that the former
   controls what is transmitted in the two directions while the latter
   controls if any media should be transmitted in a particular
   direction.  This means that an "a=sendonly" attribute overrides any
   recv direction specification for the configuration, in other words
   these attributes serves as a "mains switch" for media in the two
   directions.


4.  Use cases

   The following subsections describe different use cases for the new
   asymmetry extension.

4.1.  Asymmetric Media Format (Audio)

   The number of channels for a given user may differ in the two
   directions.  As an example a user may use a mono-microphone and
   stereo headphones.  In this case it is preferable to set up a mono
   stream in one direction and a stereo stream in the other direction.

   Assume that node C has the capability of receiving in stereo but only
   transmitting in mono, and node M can both send and receive in stereo.

   Node C then sends the SDP offer

   and the RTP communication may be started.  Optionally it is possible
   that M does not support stereo, the answer SDP would then look like.

   An interesting use case is a situation where it is desired to run
   video with very different bitrates (or even different codecs) in the
   two directions, one such example SDP would look like:

   receive H.263 (500kbps).  It may also be the case that the answerer
   can only send H.263, in which case the streams part of the answer
   would look like:

   the session this may be a problem (unsure how big it is in reality).]

4.3.  Asymmetric Number of Streams

   The idea is to have separate identities for the available number of
   media streams that can be transmitted between the central point and a
   participant in a tightly coupled conference.  For e.g.  RTP this will
   mean that the available media streams between the mixer (M) and the
   participant will have separate SSRC, e.g.  SSRC_bridge_A1,
   SSRC_bridge_A2, ...  SSRC_bridge_AN, where N is the maximum number of
   media streams that can be sent between the central point and a
   specific participant, for instance A. Note that this number can
   either be fixed or negotiated at call setup.  The active media
   sources, as decided upon by the central point, are then mapped onto
   these media streams, and the corresponding SSRC from the originating
   participant is used for the CSRC in the packets.

   With reference to figure 1, consider a scenario with a participant A
   that has the capability to receive three simultaneous media streams.
   In the conference, the first participant producing an active media is
   participant B. The media originating from participant B is then
   subsequently transmitted from the central point to participant A
   using SSRC_bridge_A1 and with SSRC_B used as CSRC_bridge_A1 in the
   RTP packets.  Next, two more participants, C and D in turn, start
   producing media that is decided as active by the central point, and
   these are transmitted to participant A using SSRC_bridge_A2 with
   SSRC_C as CSRC_bridge_A2, and SSRC_bridge_A3 with SSRC_D as
   CSRC_bridge_A3, respectively.

   If a fourth participant, E, starts to produce active media, this
   media cannot be transmitted to participant A simultaneously with the
   media from participants B, C, and D, since participant A only has the
   possibility to receive and process media from three other
   participants.  Hence, the central point has to decide on which of the
   4 incoming media streams to pass on to participant A. If, as an
   example, participant C is decided by the central point to produce the
   least active media, then media from participant C is no longer
   transmitted to participant A, and the media from participant E is
   instead transmitted to participant A using SSRC_bridge_A2 with SSRC_E
   as CSRC_bridge_A2 in the RTP packets.

   Since the CSRC in the packets from the central point with
   SSRC_bridge_A2 has changed, participant A then has the ability to
   immediately detect this and start processing the media from
   participants E without any delay.

   The above description relates to the case where the mixer has the
   ability to send multiple streams.  A similar situation may also occur
   if a terminal has the ability to separate the audio input into
   individual sources, e.g. using source separation based on multi-
   microphone techniques.  Then each individual audio source (usually an
   individual talker but also other sound sources may be considered) may
   be sent as individual signal sources from the participant to the
   central point.

   Assume that a node A can receive three incoming streams and send one
   stream, and a node M can receive one and send three streams, as
   displayed in Figure 2.  Note that a node in this context may be
   either a central point or a participant.

     Figure 2

   In order to negotiate the format of the media streams so as to
   utilize the full processing and rendering capabilities, node A sends
   an offer with an AMR-WB stream but also specifies that it can handle
   3 parallel incoming streams (alternatives for 2 and 1 streams are
   also given).  The media stream is set to inactive since the number of
   streams needs to be negotiated before setting up the resources needed
   for coding and decoding.  This can be achieved with the following
   attributes in the SDP:
      ----
      a=tcap:1 RTP/AVP
      m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
      a=creq:med-v0,bcap-v0
      a=rptmap:96 AMR-WB/16000/1
      a=mcap:1 AMR-WB/16000/1
      a=bcap:1 AS:40
      a=pcfg:1 +asym-v0 \
         recv t=1 m=1(3),AS:120|1(2),AS:80|1,AS:40 pt=1:96 \
         send t=1 m=1,AS:40 pt=1:96
      a=pcfg:2 t=1 m=1 b=1 pt=1:96
      a=inactive
      ----

   Node M recognizes the processing and rendering capabilities expressed
   by node A, and answers:
      ----
      a=tcap:1 RTP/AVP
      m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
      a=creq:med-v0,bcap-v0
      a=rptmap:96 AMR-WB/16000/1
      a=mcap:1 AMR-WB/16000/1
      a=acfg:1 +asym-v0 \
         send t=1 m=1(3),AS:120 pt=1:96 recv t=1 m=1,AS:40 pt=1:96
      a=inactive
      ----

   Node A now knows that node M supports 3 parallel outgoing streams and

   can therefore set up the needed resources for decoding three parallel
   streams.  The streams are then activated by sending an update SDP:
      ----
      a=tcap:1 RTP/AVP
      m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
      a=creq:med-v0,bcap-v0
      a=rptmap:96 AMR-WB/16000/1
      a=mcap:1 AMR-WB/16000/1
      b=AS:120
      a=pcfg:1 +asym-v0 \
         recv t=1 m=1(3),AS:120 pt=1:96 send t=1 m=1,AS:40 pt=1:96
      a=sendrecv
      ----

   The b=AS parameter is added to indicate that A can receive a bitrate
   of 120kbps.

   Finally, node M answers:
      ----
      a=tcap:1 RTP/AVP
      m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
      a=creq:med-v0,bcap-v0
      a=rptmap:96 AMR-WB/16000/1
      a=mcap:1 AMR-WB/16000/1
      b=AS:40
      a=acfg:1 +asym-v0 \
         send t=1 m=1(3),AS:120 pt=1:96 recv t=1 m=1,AS:40 pt=1:96
      a=sendrecv
      ----

   M indicates in the answer that it can receive a bitrate of 40kbps.

   After this the RTP communication may be started.


5.  Considerations

5.1.  Payload Formats that Supports Asymmetry

   Certain payload format already supports asymmetry.  One such example
   is RFC3984bis (H.264) which allows level downgrading and
   specification of sprop-level-parameter-sets.  In general it is NOT
   RECOMMENDED to use the asymmetric extension described in this draft
   in these cases.

Internet-Draft          Asymmetric Media with SDP               Feb 2009


5.2.  Backwards Compatibility

   For reasons of backwards compatibility it is RECOMMENDED to specify a
   number of potential and/or latent configurations that does not use
   the asymmetry extension described in this draft.

5.3.  Bidirectional Attributes

   Bidirectional attributes [Ed.  Note: is this the correct term?] are
   in the SDPCapNeg framework wrapped in the "a=acap" attribute.  One
   such example is
      ---
      a=acap:1 crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80  \
             inline:WVNfX19zZW1jdGwgKCkgewkyMjA7fQp9CnVubGVz|2^20|1:4
      ---

   In the SDPCapNeg framework the selected crypto attribute is copied to
   an "a=crypto" attribute and with other keying material.  As the new
   extension to [SDPCapNeg] defined in this memo does not allow this for
   reasons of asymmetry the selected crypto attributes MUST remain in
   their "a=acap" attributes.  Moreover the keying info is subject to
   change.  A consequence of this is that the same "a=acap:x
   crypto:x...." can not be used in the send and the receive direction.
   [Ed.  Note...  Confusing text, rewrite...].

   Other examples of bidirectional attributes may be those contained by
   the "a=mfcap" attributes, in this case it is also necessary to define
   extra "a=mcap" attributes in order to isolate the send and receive
   directions.


6.  Open Issues

   Open issues and observations.

   o  Asymmetric sessions in practice means that the bandwidth
      requirements in each direction will differ, and also that this
      difference may be quite large.  A solution to this is given that
      may in some cases conflict with the mechanisms in sections 5.1 and
      6.1 in [RFC3264]

   o  Can the answerer modify alternatives towards a lower value, for
      instance can
         ----
         a=pcfg:1 +asym-v0 \
            send t=1 m=1(3),2,AS:200 b=1 pt=1:96,2:97 \
            recv t=1 m=1 pt=1:96
         ----



Johansson                Expires August 14, 2009               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Asymmetric Media with SDP               Feb 2009


      be modified to ?.
         ----
         a=pcfg:1 +asym-v0 \
            send t=1 m=1(2),2,AS:200 b=1 pt=1:96,2:97 \
            recv t=1 m=1 b=4 pt=1:96
         ----
      A problem with this possibility is that it may make bandwidth
      specifiers showing wrong values.  In some cases it may be possible
      to recompute the bandwidth but in the general case it is likely
      too complicated.  Worth notice is also that the attribute in its
      present formulation makes it possible to specify several
      alternatives with maintained support for consistent bandwidth
      modifiers.

   o  Is there a need to clearly specify when negotiation is finalized,
      like is done for example in XMPP Jinge (session-initiate, session-
      accept) ?.
