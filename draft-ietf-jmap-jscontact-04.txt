            JSContact: A JSON representation of contact data
                      draft-ietf-jmap-jscontact-04

Abstract

   This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of
   contact card information that can be used for data storage and
   exchange in address book or directory applications.  It aims to be an
   alternative to the vCard data format and to be unambiguous,
   extendable and simple to process.  In contrast to the JSON-based
   jCard format, it is not a direct mapping from the vCard data model
   and expands semantics where appropriate.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for contact card data normally
   used in address book or directory applications and services.  It aims
   to be an alternative to the vCard data format [RFC6350] and to
   provide a JSON-based standard representation of contact card data.

   The key design considerations for this data model are as follows:

   o  Most of the initial set of attributes should be taken from the
      vCard data format [RFC6350] and extensions ([RFC6473], [RFC6474],
      [RFC6715], [RFC6869], [RFC8605]).  The specification should add
      new attributes or value types, or not support existing ones, where
      appropriate.  Conversion between the data formats need not fully
      preserve semantic meaning.

   o  The attributes of the cards data represented must be described as
      a simple key-value pair, reducing complexity of its
      representation.

   o  The data model should avoid all ambiguities and make it difficult
      to make mistakes during implementation.

   o  Extensions, such as new properties and components, MUST NOT lead
      to requiring an update to this document.

   The representation of this data model is defined in the I-JSON format
   [RFC7493], which is a strict subset of the JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) Data Interchange Format [RFC8259].  Using JSON is mostly a
   pragmatic choice: its widespread use makes JSCard easier to adopt,
   and the availability of production-ready JSON implementations
   eliminates a whole category of parser-related interoperability
   issues.

1.1.  Relation to the xCard and jCard formats

   The xCard [RFC6351] and jCard [RFC7095] specifications define
   alternative representations for vCard data, in XML and JSON format
   respectively.  Both explicitly aim to not change the underlying data
   model.  Accordingly, they are regarded as equal to vCard in the
   context of this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Vendor-specific Property Extensions and Values

   Vendors MAY add additional properties to JSContact objects to support
   their custom features.  The names of these properties MUST be
   prefixed with a domain name controlled by the vendor to avoid
   conflict, e.g. "example.com/customprop".

   Some JSContact properties allow vendor-specific value extensions.  If
   so, vendor-specific values MUST be prefixed with a domain name
   controlled by the vendor, e.g. "example.com/customrel".

   Vendors are strongly encouraged to register any new property values
   or extensions that are useful to other systems as well, rather than
   using a vendor-specific prefix.

2.  JSCard

   MIME type: "application/jscontact+json;type=jscard"

   A JSCard object stores information about a person, organization or
   company.

2.1.  Metadata properties

2.1.1.  uid

   Type: "String" (mandatory).

   An identifier, used to associate the object as the same across
   different systems, addressbooks and views.  [RFC4122] describes a
   range of established algorithms to generate universally unique
   identifiers (UUID), and the random or pseudo-random version is
   recommended.  For compatibility with [RFC6350] UIDs, implementations
   MUST accept both URI and free-form text.

2.1.2.  prodId

   Type: "String" (optional).

   The identifier for the product that created the JSCard object.

2.1.3.  updated

   Type: "String" (optional).

   The date and time when the data in this JSCard object was last
   modified.  The timestamp MUST be formatted as specified in [RFC3339].

2.1.4.  kind

   Type: "String" (optional).  The kind of the entity the Card
   represents.

   The value MUST be either one of the following values, registered in a
   future RFC, or a vendor-specific value:

   o  "individual": a single person

   o  "org": an organization

   o  "location": a named location

   o  "device": a device, such as appliances, computers, or network
      elements

   o  "application": a software application

2.1.5.  relatedTo

   Type: "String[Relation]" (optional).

   Relates the object to other JSCard objects.  This is represented as a
   map of the URI (or single text value) of the related objects to a
   possibly empty set of relation types.  The Relation object has the
   following properties:

   o  relation: "String[Boolean]" (optional, default: empty Object)
      Describes how the linked object is related to the linking object.
      The relation is defined as a set of relation types.  If empty, the
      relationship between the two objects is unspecified.  Keys in the
      set MUST be one of the RELATED property [RFC6350] type parameter
      values, or an IANA-registered value, or a vendor-specific value.
      The value for each key in the set MUST be true.

   Note, the Relation object only has one property; it is specified as
   an object with a single property to allow for extension in the
   future.

2.3.6.  preferredContactLanguages

   Type : "String[ContactLanguage[]]" (optional)

   Defines the preferred languages for contacting the entity associated
   with this card.  The keys in the object MUST be [RFC5646] language
   tags.  The values are a (possibly empty) list of contact language
   preferences for this language.  Also see the definition of the VCARD
   LANG property (Section 6.4.4., [RFC6350]).

   A ContactLanguage object has the following properties:

   o  type: "String" (optional).  Defines the context of this
      preference.  This could be "work", "home" or another value.

5.  Implementation Status

   NOTE: Please remove this section and the reference to [RFC7942] prior
   to publication as an RFC.  This section records the status of known
   implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the
   time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal
   described in [RFC7942].  The description of implementations in this
   section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
   progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
   individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
   IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
   information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
   This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
   of available implementations or their features.  Readers are advised
   to note that other implementations may exist.  According to
   [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign
   due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code,
   which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback
   that have made the implemented protocols more mature.  It is up to
   the individual working groups to use this information as they see
   fit".

5.1.  IIT-CNR/Registro.it

   o  Responsible Organization: Institute of Informatics and Telematics
      of National Research Council (IIT-CNR)/Registro.it

   o  Location: https://rdap.pubtest.nic.it/ [2]

   o  Description: This implementation includes support for RDAP queries
      using data from the public test environment of .it ccTLD.  The
      RDAP server does not implement any security policy because data
      returned by this server are only for experimental testing
      purposes.  The RDAP server returns responses including JSCard in
      place of jCard when queries contain the parameter jscard=1.

   o  Level of Maturity: This is a "proof of concept" research
      implementation.

   o  Coverage: This implementation includes all of the features
      described in this specification.
