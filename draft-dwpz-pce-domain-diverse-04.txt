                    PCE support for Domain Diversity
                    draft-dwpz-pce-domain-diverse-04

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing path for
   services that traverse multi-area and multi-AS Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE)
   networks.

   Path computation should facilitate the selection of paths with domain
   diversity.  This document examines the existing mechanisms to do so
   and further propose some extensions to Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP).

1.  Introduction

   The ability to compute shortest constrained TE LSPs in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across
   multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.  In this
   context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common
   sphere of address management or path computational responsibility

   such as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous
   Systems (AS).

   In a multi-domain environment, Domain Diversity is defined in
   [RFC6805].  A pair of paths are domain-diverse if they do not
   traverse any of the same transit domains.  Domain diversity may be
   maximized for a pair of paths by selecting paths that have the
   smallest number of shared domains.  Path computation should
   facilitate the selection of domain diverse paths as a way to reduce
   the risk of shared failure and automatically helps to ensure path
   diversity for most of the route of a pair of LSPs.

   The main motivation behind domain diversity is to avoid fate sharing,
   but it can also be because of some geo-political reasons and
   commercial relationships that would require domain diversity.  for
   example, a pair of paths should choose different transit Autonomous
   System (AS) because of some policy considerations.

   In case when full domain diversity could not be achieved, it is
   helpful to minimize the common shared domains.  Also it is
   interesting to note that other scope of diversity (node, link, SRLG
   etc) can still be applied inside the common shared domains.

   This document examine a way to achieve domain diversity with existing
   inter-domain path computation mechanism like per-domain path
   computation technique [RFC5152], Backward Recursive Path Computation
   (BRPC) mechanism [RFC5441] and Hierarchical PCE [RFC6805].  This
   document also considers synchronized as well as non-synchronized
   dependent path computations.  Since independent and synchronized path
   computation cannot be used to apply diversity, it is not discussed in
   this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The terminology is as per [RFC5440].

3.  Domain Diversity

   As described in [RFC6805], a set of paths are considered to be domain
   diverse if they do not share any transit domains, apart from ingress
   and egress domains.

   Some additional parameters to consider would be -

   Minimize shared domain:  When a fully domain diverse path is not
      possible, PCE could be requested to minimize the number of shared
      transit domains.  This can also be termed as maximizing partial
      domain diversity.  Other scope of diversity (node, link, SRLG etc)
      can still be applied inside the common shared domains.

   Boundary Nodes:  Diversity in boundary node selection can be achieved
      by node diversity.

3.1.  Per Domain Path Computation

   The per domain path computation technique [RFC5152] defines a method
   where the path is computed during the signaling process (on a per-
   domain basis).  The entry Boundary Node (BN) of each domain is
   responsible for performing the path computation for the section of
   the LSP that crosses the domain, or for requesting that a PCE for
   that domain computes that piece of the path.

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the setup of
      primary path, a domain diverse path can be signaled by encoding
      the transit domain identifiers in exclude route object (XRO) or
      explicit exclusion route subobject (EXRS) using domain sub-objects
      defined in [DOMAIN-SUBOBJ] and [RFC3209] in RSVP-TE.  Note that
      the head end LSR should be aware of transit domain identifiers of
      the primary path to be able to do so.  Also a head end label
      switching router (LSR) can signal a path by using a domain diverse
      domain sequence known in priori and encoded in explicit route
      object (ERO) in path message.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Not Applicable.

3.2.  Backward-Recursive PCE-based Computation

   The BRPC [RFC5441] technique involves cooperation and communication
   between PCEs in order to compute an optimal end-to-end path across
   multiple domains.  The sequence of domains to be traversed maybe
   known before the path computation, but it can also be used when the
   domain path is unknown and determined during path computation.

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the path
      computation of the primary path, a domain diverse path computation
      request is sent by PCC to the PCE, by encoding the transit domain
      identifiers in XRO or EXRS using domain sub-objects defined in
      [PCE-DOMAIN] and [RFC3209] in PCEP.  Note that the PCC should be

Internet-Draft               DOMAIN-DIVERSE                 October 2015


      aware of transit domain identifiers of the primary path to be able
      to do so.  Also a PCC can request a path by using a domain diverse
      domain sequence known in priori and encoded in include route
      object (IRO) in path request message.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Not Applicable.  [Since different
      transit domain PCEs may be involved , there is difficulty to
      achieve synchronization for domain diverse path computation].
      Note that [RFC5440] describes other diversity parameters (node,
      link, SRLG etc) that may be applied.

3.3.  Hierarchical PCE

   In H-PCE [RFC6805] architecture, the parent PCE is used to compute a
   multi-domain path based on the domain connectivity information.  The
   parent PCE may be requested to provide a end to end path or only the
   sequence of domains.

3.3.1.  End to End Path

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the path
      computation of the primary path, a domain diverse path computation
      request is sent to the parent PCE, by encoding the transit domain
      identifiers in XRO or EXRS using domain sub-objects defined in
      [PCE-DOMAIN] and [RFC3209] in PCEP.  Note that the PCC should be
      aware of transit domain identifiers of the primary path to be able
      to do so.  The parent PCE should provide a domain diverse end to
      end path.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Child PCE should be able to request
      dependent and synchronized domain diverse end to end paths from
      its parent PCE.  A new flag is added in syncronized vectore (SVEC)
      object for this (Refer Section 4.1).

3.3.2.  Domain-Sequence

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the primary path
      computation using H-PCE (involving domain-sequence selection by
      parent PCE and end-to-end path computation via BRPC or Per-Domain
      mechanisms), a domain diverse path computation request is sent to
      the parent PCE, by encoding the transit domain identifiers in XRO
      or EXRS using domain sub-objects defined in [PCE-DOMAIN] and
      [RFC3209] in PCEP.  Note that the PCC should be aware of transit
      domain identifiers of the primary path to be able to do so.  The
      parent PCE should provide a diverse domain sequence.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Child PCE should be able to request
      dependent and synchronized diverse domain-sequence(s) from it's
      parent PCE.  A new flag is added in SVEC object for this (Refer
      Section 4.1).  The parent PCE should reply with diverse domain
      sequence(s) encoded in ERO as described in [PCE-DOMAIN].

4.  Extension to PCEP

   [Editor's Note: It has been requested to move this section to the
   HPCE-Extension document - draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy-extensions.  This
   section would be removed from this document once that is done.]

4.1.  SVEC Object

   [RFC5440] defines SVEC object which includes flags for the potential
   dependency between the set of path computation requests (Link, Node
   and SRLG diverse).  This document proposes a new flag O for domain
   diversity.

   The format of the SVEC object body is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Reserved    |                   Flags           |O|P|D|S|N|L|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                     Request-ID-number #1                      |
      //                                                             //
      |                     Request-ID-number #M                      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 1: SVEC Body Object Format

   Following new bit is added in the Flags field:

   * O (Domain diverse) bit:  when set, this indicates that the computed
      paths corresponding to the requests specified by the following RP
      objects MUST NOT have any transit domain(s) in common.

   The Domain Diverse O-bit can be used in Hierarchical PCE path
   computation to compute synchronized domain diverse end to end path or
   diverse domain sequences as described in Section 3.3.

   When domain diverse O bit is set, it is applied to the transit
   domains.  The other bit in SVEC object (N, L, S etc) is set, should
   still be applied in the ingress and egress domain.

4.2.  Minimize Shared Domains

   In case when full domain diversity could not be achieved, it maybe
   helpful to minimize the common shared domains.  It's interesting to
   note that diversity (node, link etc) can still be applied inside the
   common shared transit domains as well as for ingress and egress
   domain via the bits in SVEC object (N, L, S etc).

   A new Objective function (OF) [RFC5541] code for synchronized path
   computation requests is proposed:

   MCTD

   *  Name:  Minimize the number of Common Transit Domains.

   *  Objective Function Code:  TBD

   *  Description:  Find a set of paths such that it passes through the
      least number of common transit domains.

   The MCTD OF can be used in Hierarchical PCE path computation to
   request synchronized domain diverse end to end paths or diverse
   domain sequences as described in Section 3.3.

   [Editor's Note: A new document is created for the OF for minimizing
   shared node, links, SRLGs inside the domain - [PCE-OF-DIVERSE].]

   For non synchronized diverse domain path computation the X bit in XRO
   or EXRS [RFC5521] sub-objects can be used, where X bit set as 1
   indicates that the domain specified SHOULD be excluded from the path
   computed by the PCE, but MAY be included subject to PCE policy and
   the absence of a viable path that meets the other constraints and
   excludes the domain.

4.3.  Relationship between SVEC Diversity Flags and OF

   [RFC5440] uses SVEC diversity flag for node, link or SRLG to describe
   the potential disjointness between the set of path computation
   requests used in PCEP protocol.  This document further extends by
   adding domain-diverse O-bit in SVEC object and a new OF Code for
   minimizing the number of shared transit domain.

   Further [PCE-OF-DIVERSE] defines three new OF codes to maximize
   diversity as much as possible, in other words, minimize the common
   shared resources (Node,Link or SRLG) between a set of paths.

Internet-Draft               DOMAIN-DIVERSE                 October 2015


   It may be interesting to note that the diversity flags in the SVEC
   object and OF for diversity can be used together.  Some example of
   usage are listed below -

   o  SVEC object with domain-diverse bit=1 - ensure full domain-
      diversity.

   o  SVEC object with domain-diverse bit=1 and node/link diverse bit=1
      - ensure full domain-diversity, as well as node/link diverse in
      ingress and egress domain.

   o  SVEC object with domain-diverse bit=0 and OF=MCTD - domain-
      diversity as much as possible.

   o  SVEC object with domain-diverse bit=0;node/link diverse bit=1 and
      OF=MCTD - domain-diversity as much as possible, as well as node/
      link diverse in ingress, egress and shared transit domains.

   o  SVEC object with domain-diverse bit=1 and OF=MCTD - ensure full
      domain-diversity.

5.  Other Considerations

5.1.  Transit Domain Identifier

   In case of non-synchronized path computation, Ingress node (i.e. a
   PCC) should be aware of transit domain identifiers of the primary
   path.  So during the path computation or signaling of the primary
   path, the transit domain should be identified.

   A possible solution for path computation could be a flag in RP object
   requesting domain identifier to be returned in the PCEP path reply
   message.

   [Editor's Note: There should be a mechanism in signaling and path
   computation to obtain the domain information.  Further details - TBD]

5.2.  Diversity v/s Optimality

   In case of non-synchronized path computation, PCE may be requested to
   provide an optimal primary path first and then PCC requests for a
   backup path with exclusion.  Note that this approach does not
   guarantee diversity compared to disjoint path computations for
   primary and backup path in a synchronized manner.

   A synchronized path computation with diversity flags and/or objective
   function is used to make sure that both the primary path and the
   backup path can be computed simultaneously with full diversity or

Internet-Draft               DOMAIN-DIVERSE                 October 2015


   optimized to be as diverse as possible.  In the latter case we may
   sacrifice optimal path for diversity, thus there is a trade-off
   between the two.

   An implementation may further choose to analyze the trade-off i.e. it
   may send multiple request to PCE asking to optimize based on
   diversity as well as say, cost and make an intelligent choice between
   them.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document add a new bit to SVEC object and define a new object
   function.  The security of the procedures described in this document
   depends on PCEP [RFC5440].  [RFC6007] describe security
   considerations when SVEC are supported.

7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to [RFC5440], the PCC should construct the SVECs to
   identify and associate domain diverse SVEC relationships.
   Considerations for use of objective functions are mentioned in
   [RFC5541].

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP MIB Module defined in [RFC7420], there are no additional
   parameters identified in this document.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   The domain-diverse path computation in this document allows PCEs to
   compute optimal sets of diverse paths.  This type of path computation
   and cooperation may require more time to obtain its results.
   Therefore, it is recommended for PCEP to support the PCE monitoring
   mechanism specified in [RFC5886].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   [RFC5440] provides a sufficient description for this document.  There
   are no additional considerations.

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   There should be a mechanism in signaling and path computation to
   obtain the domain information during primary path computation.
   Details to be added in future revision.

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440] and
   [RFC6007].

8.  IANA Considerations
