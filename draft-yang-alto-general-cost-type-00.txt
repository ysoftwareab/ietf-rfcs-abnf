                   ALTO Extension: General Cost Types
                draft-yang-alto-general-cost-type-00.txt

Abstract

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined
   both the endpoint cost service (ECS) and cost maps to provide
   information to applications about network path properties (e.g.,
   routingcost) from a set of source network points to a set of
   destination network points, where each network point can be a single
   endpoint (in ECS) or a PID which represents a set of endpoints (in a
   cost map).  Considering, conceptually, both ECS and cost map as
   returning a matrix, indexed by sources and destinations as row and
   column, the current ALTO protocol [RFC7285] allows the elements in
   the matrix to be only scalar (i.e., numerical or ordinal).  This,
   however, is limiting in many use cases.  This document discuss
   multiple use cases where scalar-elements can be limitations.  It then
   defines new cost types to allow general cost types, such as vectors
   to represent use cases such path vectors.

1.  Introduction

   Both ECS and cost maps, the two basic services of ALTO, can be
   considered as returning a matrix, indexed by sources and destinations
   as row and column, where each element in the matrix represents a path
   property (called cost) from a source to a destination.  Although
   [RFC7285] recognizes the need to allow flexible cost values, and
   hence defines each element in the cost matrix as the generic
   JSONValue type, for the two defined cost modes, 'numerical' and
   'ordinal', the type can be only scalars.  This, however, can be
   limiting.

   There are multiple use cases where the elements are not simple
   scalars.  In [draft-randriamasy-alto-calendar], each element is an
   array representing a cost calendar.  In a simple case, each element
   of the calendar is a scalar, e.g., src1->dst1: [1, 1.5, 1.1].  In a
   general case (e.g., representing statistics such as min, max, and
   average), the calendar can be: src1->dst1: [ [0.9, 1.1, 1.0], [1.4,
   1.5, 1.6], [1.0, 1.1, 1.2]].  In [draft-randriamasy-alto-multi-cost],
   each element is a vector, to define a value for each cost metric; in

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector          October 2015


   [draft-yang-alto-path-vector], each element is a vector representing
   the sequence of network elements traversed in the path.

   The goal of this extension is to go beyond the scalar-element
   limitation to accommodate the preceding use cases.

   The organization of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   specifies generic cost types.  Sections 4 and 5 discuss security and
   IANA considerations.

2.  Background

   [RFC7285] already introduces the 'cost-type' meta data to indicate
   the type of each element in the cost matrix.  The specific definition
   of cost-type is:

     object {
       CostMetric cost-metric;
       CostMode   cost-mode;
       [JSONString description;]
     } CostType;


   Both cost maps and ECS use cost type to parse map data.  The
   definition of a cost map is:

     object {
       CostMapData cost-map;
     } InfoResourceCostMap : ResponseEntityBase;

     object-map {
       PIDName -> DstCosts;
     } CostMapData;

     object-map {
       PIDName -> JSONValue;
     } DstCosts;


   The definition of an endpoint cost map is:

     object {
       EndpointCostMapData endpoint-cost-map;
     } InfoResourceEndpointCostMap : ResponseEntityBase;

     object-map {
       TypedEndpointAddr -> EndpointDstCosts;
     } EndpointCostMapData;

     object-map {
       TypedEndpointAddr -> JSONValue;
     } EndpointDstCosts;


   For both (network) cost map and endpoint cost service map, one can
   think of the JSONValue element as value component (<metric-value>) of
   a JSON object {'<cost-metric-name>': <metric-value>}. For example,
   suppose the cost-metric is 'routingcost', then each element
   (JSONValue) is routingcost-value of the JSON object
   {'routingcost':routingcost-value}.

3.  Generic Cost Types

   Given the preceding generalization, we define generic cost-type
   values by using 'cost-mode' to indicate the schema type, 'cost-
   metric' as a name for the schema, and 'description' providing a link
   or inline text to the schema defined.  Each element in the cost map
   or endpoint cost service map is just JSON encoding of the JSON value.

   Specifically, For 'cost-mode' being 'numerical', the schema is JSON
   number; For 'cost-mode' being 'ordinal', the schema is JSON integer.

   We define a new 'cost-mode' as 'YANG', and hence we can define the
   type of elements in the cost map or endpoint cost service map using
   YANG.  For example, to define 'pathvector', we define

     module alto-cost-metric {
       namespace "http://example.com/alto-cost-metrics";
       prefix alto;
       leaf-list pathvector {
         type string;
         min-elements "1";
       }
     }


   Native JSON encoding of the YANG model is

     {
       "pathvector" : []
     }


   The specification is that each element in a cost map or an endpoint
   cost service map uses the value of the attribute (cost-metric name)
   defined.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has not conducted its security analysis.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Final version of this document wil require definitions of new cost-
   mode such as yang.
