1.   Motivation 
    
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol provides necessary mechanism for 
   device configuration. However, there is no provision for Mobile 
   access points to get their radio configuration information elements. 
    
   With Introduction of portable mobile Access points, users can take 
   these mobile access points along with them where ever they go to 
   extend wired network to wireless network. Problem is when multiple 
   users take multiple access points to a Motel then there will be 
   overlapping radio cells, because one radio cell may go across 
   multiple motel rooms. One way to solve this problem is to configure 
   lower transmit power levels on these access points. However users 
   will not proactively configure lower transmit powers on their access 
   points. 802.11h TPC is only to control transmit power of 802.11 
   clients not for the access points. We need a way to automatically set 
   the transmit power from wired network, that way network admin can 
   configure lower transmit powers to decrease the radio cell size 
   depending on the room sizes, so that multiple rooms can have their 
   own cell without interfering other radio cells. 
    
   Mobile access points may get radio specific configuration parameters 
   for this network from DHCP server, to determine what is the max 
   transmit power allowed, which country this mobile portable access 
   point has been plugged into, what are the recommended RF channels not 
   to be used while connected to this network.

2.   Mobile access point radio Configuration parameters option format 
    
   The option begins with a tag octet containing the option code(TBD). A 
   length octet following the tag octet. The value of the length octet 
   does not include itself or the tag octet. This option layout is 
   depicted below: 
    
   +------+--------+--------------+--------------+---+--------------+ 
   | TBD  |Length  | Sub-option 1 | Sub-option 2 |...| Sub-option n | 
   +------+--------+--------------+--------------+---+--------------+ 
    
   A sub-option begins with a tag octet containing the sub-option code. 
   A length octet follows the tag octet.  The value of the length octet 
   does not include itself or the tag octet.  The length octet is 
   followed by "length" octets of sub-option information.  The sub-ption 
   layout is depicted below: 
    
   +-------------------+--------+------------------------+ 
   | Sub-option Code   | Length | Sub-option information | 
   +-------------------+--------+------------------------+ 
    
    
2.1     Radio transmit power sub-option 
    
   This sub-option provides a Max allowed Transmit power in unit of dBm. 
   It is a one octet value. 
    Code   Len   802.11 wireless transmit power 
   +-----+-----+---------------+----- 
   | 1   |  1  |  power in dBm | 
   +-----+-----+---------------+----- 
    
    
2.2     Radio IOS 3166 country code sub-option 
    
   This sub-option provides the country code of the network in which 
   this mobile access point is connected to. This information MUST be 
   used to derive the RF channel list this access point is supposed to 
   operate as per regulatory requirements.  
    
    Code  Len   802.11 wireless A2 IS0 3166 country code 
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-- 
   | 2   |  2  |  c1 |  c2 | 
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-- 
    
   County code values are to be taken from valid ISO 3166 standard. 
   Alpha-2 code elements MUST be used in this option. c1 and c2 are the 
   two characters for a given country code.

2.3     Radio reserved RF channels sub-option 
    
   This sub-option provides a list of channel a mobile access point not 
   supposed to operate in order to avoid interference to the native 
   devices operating in the network. 
    
    Code  Len    802.11 wireless reserved channels 
   +-----+-----+----------+-----------+----------+--- 
   | 3   |  n  | channel1 |  channel2 | channel3 | . . . . . 
   +-----+-----+----------+-----------+----------+--- 
    
   Channel[1..n] is 4 digit representation of the radio frequency in 
   MHz. Example: 2412 MHz, 2462 MHz, 5180 MHz. 
    
    
    
3.   IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA is requested to assign an option code for radio configuration 
   parameters for mobile access points. 
     
    
4. Security Considerations 
    
   These DHCP options may be used by intruder DHCP server to mislead the 
   mobile access points to operate in country domain other than the 
   existing country and provide wrong power levels.
