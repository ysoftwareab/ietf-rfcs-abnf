            A DNS RR for specifying the location of services

Abstract

   This document describes a DNS RR which specifies the location of the
   server(s) for a specific protocol and domain (like a more general
   form of MX).

   This draft has file name "draft-gulbrandsen-dns-rr-srvcs-02.txt" and
   expires on April 11, 1996.

Overview and rationale

   Currently, one must either know the exact address of a server to con-
   tact it, or broadcast a question.  This has led to e.g.
   ftp.whatever.com aliases, the SMTP-specific MX RR, and using MAC-
   level broadcasts to locate servers.

   The SRV RR allows a client to ask for a specific service/protocol for
   a specific domain (the word domain is used here in the strict RFC1034
   sense), and get back the names of any available servers.  This allows
   domain adminstrators to use several servers for a single domain, to
   move servers with little fuss, and to designate some servers as pri-
   mary and others as backups.

The format of the SRV RR

   Here is the format of the SRV RR:

        service.protocol.name ttl class SRV priority weight port target

        (There is an example near the end of the draft.)

   Service
        The symbolic name of the desired service, as defined in Assigned
        Numbers or locally.

        Some widely-used services, notably POP, don't have a single uni-
        versal name.  If Assigned Numbers names the service indicated,
        that name is the only name which is legal for SRV lookups.  Only
        locally defined services may be named locally.

        The Service is case insensitive (it has to be, it's part of the
        DNS look-up key).

   Protocol
        The symbolic name of the desired protocol.  TCP and UDP are at
        present the most useful values for this field, though any name
        defined by Assigned Numbers or locally may be used (as for Ser-
        vice).  Case insensitive.

   Name
        The domain this RR refers to.  The SRV RR is unique in that the
        name one searches for is not this name; the example near the end
        shows this clearly.

   TTL
        Standard DNS meaning.

   Class
        Standard DNS meaning.

   Priority
        As for MX, the priority of this target host.  A client MUST
        attempt to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered pri-
        ority it can reach; target hosts with the same priority SHOULD
        be tried in pseudorandom order.  The range is 0-65535.  Domain
        adminstrators are urged to use Priority 0 for the primary
        server(s), to make the RR easier to read for humans using dig or
        similar tools.

   Weight
        Load balancing mechanism.  When selecting a target host among

        the those that have the same priority, the chance of trying this
        one first SHOULD be proportional to its weight.  The range of
        this number is 1-65535.  Domain adminstrators are urged to use
        Weight 0 when there isn't any load balancing to do, to make the
        RR easier to read for humans (less noisy).

   Port
        The port where on this server host of this service.  The range
        is 0-65535.  This is often as specified in Assigned Numbers but
        need not be.

   Target
        As for MX, the domain name of the server host.  There MUST be
        one or more A records for this name. Implementors are urged, but
        not required, to return the A record(s) in the Additional Data
        section.  Name compression is to be used for this field.

Domain adminstrator advice

   Asking everyone to update their telnet (for example) clients when the
   first internet site adds a SRV RR for Telnet/TCP is futile (even if
   desirable).  Therefore SRV will have to coexist with old-style A
   record lookups for a long time, and DNS administrators should try to
   provide A records to support old clients:

      - Where the services for a single domain are spread over several
        hosts, it seems advisable to have a list of A RRs at the same
        DNS node as the SRV RR, listing reasonable (if perhaps subopti-
        mal) fallback hosts for Telnet, NNTP and other protocols likely
        to be used with this name.  Some programs only try the first
        address they get back from e.g. gethostbyaddr(), and we don't
        know how widespread this behaviour is.

      - Where one service is provided by several hosts, one can either
        provide A records for all the hosts (in which case the round-
        robin mechanism, where available, will share the load equally)
        or just for one (presumably the fastest).

      - If a host is intended to provide a service only when the main
        server(s) is/are down, it probably shouldn't be listed in A
        records.

      - Hosts that are referenced by backup A records must use the port
        number specified in Assigned Numbers for the service.

   Currently there's a practical limit of 512 bytes for DNS replies.
   Until all resolvers can handle larger responses, domain adminstrators
   are strongly advised to keep their SRV replies below 512 bytes.

   All round numbers, wrote Dr. Johnson, are false, and these numbers
   are very round: A reply packet has a 30-byte overhead plus the name
   of the service ("telnet.tcp.asdf.com" for instance); each SRV RR adds
   20 bytes plus the name of the target host; each NS RR in the NS sec-
   tion is 15 bytes plus the name of the name server host; and finally
   each A RR in the additional data section is 20 bytes or so, and there
   are A's for each SRV and NS RR mentioned in the answer.  This size
   estimate is extremely crude, but shouldn't underestimate the actual
   answer size by much.  If an answer may be close to the limit, using
   e.g. "dig" to look at the actual answer is a good idea.

The "Weight" field

   Weight, the load balancing field, is not quite satisfactory, but the
   actual load on typical servers changes much too quickly to be kept
   around in DNS caches.  It seems to the authors that offering adminis-
   trators a way to say "this machine is three times as fast as that
   one" is the best that can practically be done.

   The only way the authors can see of getting a "better" load figure is
   asking a separate server when the client selects a server and con-
   tacts it.  For short-lived services like SMTP an extra step in the
   connection establishment seems too expensive, and for long-lived ser-
   vices like telnet, the load figure may well be thrown off a minute
   after the connection is established when someone else starts or fin-
   ishes a heavy job.

The Port number

   Currently, the translation from service name to port number happens
   at the client, often using a file such as /etc/services.

   Moving this information to the DNS makes it less necessary to update
   these files on every single computer of the net every time a new ser-
   vice is added, and makes it possible to move standard services out of
   the "root-only" port range on unix.

Usage rules

   A SRV-cognizant client SHOULD use this procedure to locate a list of
   servers and connect to the preferred one:

        Do a lookup for QNAME=service.protocol.target, QCLASS=IN,
        QTYPE=SRV.

        If the reply is NOERROR, ANCOUNT>0 and there is at least one SRV
        RR which specifies the requested Service and Protocol in the
        reply:

Expires April 1996       DNS Service Pointer RR                 May 1995


             for all such RR's, build a list of (Priority, Weight, Tar-
             get) tuples

             Sort the list by priority (lowest number first)

             Create a new empty list

             For each distinct priority level
                  While there are still elements left at this priority
                  level
                       Select an element randomly, with probability
                       Weight, and move it to the tail of the new list

             For each element in the new list

                  query the DNS for A RR's for the Target or use any
                  RR's found in the Additional Data secion of the ear-
                  lier SRV query.

                  for each A RR found, try to connect to the (protocol,
                  address, service).

        else if the service desired is SMTP

             skip to RFC974 (MX).

        else

             Do a lookup for QNAME=target, QCLASS=IN, QTYPE=A

             for each A RR found, try to connect to the (protocol,
             address, service)

   Notes:

      - Port numbers SHOULD NOT be used in place of the symbolic service
        or protocol names (for the same reason why variant names cannot
        be allowed: Applications would have to do two or more lookups).

      - If a truncated response comes back from an SRV query, and the
        Additional Data section has at least one complete RR in it, the
        answer MUST be considered complete and the client resolver
        SHOULD NOT retry the query using TCP, but use normal UDP queries
        for A RR's missing from the Additional Data section.

      - A client MAY NOT discard any of the answers returned.  RFC 974
        allows clients to e.g. try to connect to just the 5 first MXes
        returned: Such behaviour is NOT legal with SRV lookups.

      - If the Additional Data section doesn't contain A RR's for all
        the SRV RR's, the client MUST look up the A RR(s).  (This hap-
        pens quite often when the A RR has shorter TTL than the SRV or
        NS RR's.)

      - SRV RRs with Protocol TCP and Service SMTP override MX RR's.
        This allows firewalled organizations with several SMTP relays to
        control the load distribution using the Weight field.

      - Designers of new protocols are urged to specify that SRV lookups
        be mandatory for those protocols.

      - Client resolvers may treat Weight 0 as equal to 1.

Fictional example

   This is (part of) the zone file for asdf.com, a still-unused domain:

        $ORIGIN asdf.com.
        @               SOA server.asdf.com. root.asdf.com. (
                            1995032001 3600 3600 604800 86400 )
                        NS  server.asdf.com.
                        NS  ns1.ip-provider.net.
                        NS  ns2.ip-provider.net.
        ftp.tcp         SRV 0 0 21 server.asdf.com.
        finger.tcp      SRV 0 0 79 server.asdf.com.
        ; telnet - use old-slow-box or new-fast-box if either is
        ; available, make three quarters of the logins go to
        ; new-fast-box.
        telnet.tcp      SRV 0 1 23 old-slow-box.asdf.com.
                        SRV 0 3 23 new-fast-box.asdf.com.
        ; if neither old-slow-box or new-fast-box is up, switch to
        ; using the sysdmin's box and the server
                        SRV 1 0 23 sysadmins-box.asdf.com.
                        SRV 1 0 23 server.asdf.com.
        ; SMTP - mail goes to the server, and to the IP provider if
        ; the net is down
        smtp.tcp        SRV 0 0 25 server.asdf.com.
                        SRV 1 0 25 mailhost.ip-provider.net.

        ; backup A records - new-fast-box and old-slow-box are
        ; included, naturally, and server is too, but might go
        ; if the load got too bad
        @               A   172.30.79.10

                        A   172.30.79.13

   In this example, a telnet connection to "asdf.com." needs an SRV
   lookup of "telnet.tcp.asdf.com." and possibly A lookups of "new-fast-
   box.asdf.com." and/or the other hosts named.  The size of the SRV
   reply is approximately 365 bytes:

      30 bytes general overhead
      20 bytes for the query string, "telnet.tcp.asdf.com."
      130 bytes for 4 SRV RR's, 20 bytes each plus the lengths of "new-
        fast-box", "old-slow-box", "server" and "sysadmins-box" -
        "asdf.com" in the query section is quoted here and doesn't need
        to be counted again.
      75 bytes for 3 NS RRs, 15 bytes each plus the lengths of "server",
        "ns1.ip-provider.net." and "ns2" - again, "ip-provider.net." is
        quoted and only needs to be counted once.
      120 bytes for the 6 A RR's mentioned by the SRV and NS RR's.

Security Considerations

   The authors believes this RR to be perfectly safe - or rather, not to
   cause any new security problems.  We assume that as the DNS-security
   people invent new features, DNS servers will return the relevant RRs
   in the Additional Data section when answering an SRV query.
