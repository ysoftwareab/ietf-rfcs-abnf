Abstract

   This document collects some ideas for a next generation of the Stream

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Abbreviations

   o  SCTP: Stream Control Transmission Protocol

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

1.3.  Stream Control Transmission Protocol

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) has been defined as
   RFCs in [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], [12], [13],
   [14], [15], [16].  There is also a detailed introduction provided by
   [23] as well as lots of further information material on [20].  SCTP
   is therefore not introduced in more detail here.

1.4.  Scope

   The scope of this document is to collect some ideas of what to
   update/change for a next generation of the SCTP protocol.  It is a
   result of lessons learned from more than one decade of SCTP
   deployment (see also [23]) as well as ongoing discussions on applying
   SCTP for WebRTC Data Channels (as introduced in more detail in [19]).

2.  What to Change in the Next Generation of SCTP?

   o  Make useful extensions part of the next generation core protocol
      itself (that is, make their implementation a MUST):

      *  Partial Reliablility ([5])

      *  Chunk Authentication ([7])

      *  Partial Reliablility ([9])

      *  Stream Reconfiguration ([14])

      *  SACK Immediately ([16])

   o  Consider additional features as part of the next generation core
      protocol:

      *  Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgments (NR-SACK) ([25])

      *  Concurrent Multi-Path Transfer for SCTP (CMT-SCTP) ([17])

   o  Chunk Authentication provides integrity but not confidentiality.
      There could be a feature for encryption as well, for example like
      [18].  Having encryption directly included inside the core
      transport protocol may make it easier to use (less error-prone
      work for application developers).

   o  SCTP assigns a fixed TSN per DATA chunk.  The TSN cannot be
      changed any more.  That is, it is not possible for a middlebox to
      split chunks into smaller pieces (for example, for hardware
      offloading).  For further discussion: may it be useful to consider
      a different behavior?

   o  Definition of path: For SCTP, a path is defined by a remote
      destination address. [21], [22] shows that CMT-SCTP performance
      also depends on the local endpoint's outgoing links.  Considering
      each pair of local outgoing and remote incoming address as
      different path may lead to improved performance in many Internet
      scenarios.

2.1.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for SCTP can be found in [10].

2.2.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no additional considerations for IANA.

3.  Experimental Implementations

   An Open Source simulation model for SCTP is available for OMNeT++
   within the INET Framework.  See [24] for the Git repository.  For
   documentation on the model, see [26] and [23].  This model can be
   used to evaluate future ideas for SCTP.

4.  Testbed Platform

   NorNet is a large-scale and realistic Internet testbed platform with
   support for multi-homing.  A description of and introduction to
   NorNet is provided in [27], [28], [29], [30].  Further information
   can be found on the project website [31] at https://www.nntb.no.

5.  Acknowledgments

   The author would like to thank Martin Becke for discussions and
   support.
