Abstract

   This document describes EAP-SKL, an Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) method which provides mutual authentication and key
   derivation based on a pre-shared secret.  EAP-SKL relies on the
   cryptographic protocol SKEME (Secure Key Exchange MEchanism
   protocol), and hence may benefit from its simplicity and the provable
   security.  EAP-SKL complies with the mandatory requirements for an
   EAP method which is intented for deployment in Wireless LAN
   environments.

1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.11i makes use of IEEE 802.1X which in turn chooses the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for carrying authentication
   messages.  EAP itself is only a framework, and runs over various link
   layers, like IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN or PPP.
   In fact, the proper authentication is performed by so called EAP
   methods.

   In 1998, when RFC 2284 was adopted, an usage of EAP outside of wired
   networks was not taken into account.  EAP was thoroughly reviewed,
   which yielded in May 2004 in RFC 3748.  For compatibility reasons,
   these three EAP methods are still part of the EAP specification, even
   if declared as deprecated.  EAP-MD5, for instance, lacks of mutual
   authentication and derivation of session keying material, as mandated
   in [RFC3748].

   It has been widely recognized that this state is dissatisfying.  In
   particular, it lacks of a pre-shared key EAP method, which is simple
   (that is lightweight in terms of bandwidth, latency and computational
   costs as well as easy in deployment) and, at the same time, provides
   enough security strength to be used in hostile environments like the
   Internet or Wireless LAN.  Such an EAP method could possibly serve as
   a replacement for the deprecated EAP-MD5.

   EAP-SKL attempts to be an straightforward EAP method with as much
   features as needed but as few as possible.  More precisely, EAP-SKL
   takes all mandatory requirements into account, with main focus on
   mutual authentication and adequate session key derivation.  Current
   pre-shared key EAP methods are EAP-FAST, EAP-SIM/AKA, EAP-PSK, EAP-
   PAX, EAP-TLS (with appropriate extensions) as well as EAP-IKEv2,
   where EAP-SKL claims to be the simplest one.  Further informations
   about EAP methods can be found in the comprehensive compilation
   [I-D.bersani-eap-synthesis-sharedkeymethods].

   Furthermore, EAP-SKL relies on only one cryptographic primitive,
   namely the hash function SHA-1 ([FIPS.180-1.1994]) and optionally the
   Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol ([RFC2631]).  The choice of
   SKEME as an appropriate key establishment protocol makes it possible
   to fully abstain from block ciphers and stream ciphers.  Of course,
   this restricts EAP-SKL's ability to solely perform the mutual
   authentication task, and does not allow for encrypted communication,
   like, for instance, EAP-PSK does so.  The author is convinced that
   there are many deployment scenarios, where indeed nothing more than
   minimalistic functionality is required and desired.  Consequently,
   and in contrast to many other EAP methods, EAP-SKL does not
   implement, for instance, version negotiation, fragmentation, session
   resuming, protected result indication or end-user identity hiding.

   Nevertheless, there is a single feature which is highly desireable in
   some cases, namely Perfect Forward Secrecy.

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  In the remaining
   section 1, some terminology is introduced.  Section 2 highlights the
   cryptographic background of EAP-SKL.  Section 3 and 4 cover the EAP-
   SKL protocol and the packet format of the messages.  Section 5 and 6
   are IANA Considerations and Security Considerations, respectively.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  EAP Terminology

   This section contains variables and abbreviations which will be
   referenced in later sections.  For the exact meaning of the roles
   "peer", "Supplicant", "backend authentication server" and "EAP
   server" please refer to the EAP specification [RFC3748].  In this
   document, the words peer and client are used equivalently.  The EAP
   conversation takes place between the client and the EAP server.

   Ko: 160-bit symmetric key; shared between client and EAP server.  Ko
   is the most longlife credential within EAP-SKL.

   MK: Master Key; shared between the client and EAP server from which
   all other EAP method session keys are derived.

   MSK: Master Session Key; generated from the MK and exported by the
   EAP method to the authenticator.

   EMSK: Extended Master Session Key; also generated from the MK.  It
   contains additional keying material.

   G: public Diffie-Hellman group

   g: public generator of group G

   x: 256-bit nonce generated by the client

   y: 256-bit nonce generated by the server

   .: (dot); string or binary data concatenation.

   ^: modular exponentiation

2.  Cryptographic Considerations

   This section describes the cryptographic design of EAP-SKL.  The
   cryptographic protocol SKEME was chosen to realize mutual
   authentication and session key establishment.  SKEME provides four
   operational modes, which offers high flexibility.  More precisely, it
   allows the usage of PKIs, KDC and manual (pre-shared) distribution of
   keying material for an initial keying relationship.

   Since EAP-SKL is a pre-shared key authentication method, only the
   corresponding two modes of SKEME are implemented.  The one, from now
   on referred to as "mode 1", provides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
   and hence incorporates a Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange, which is
   known to be computational expensive.  If this property is not needed,
   the other mode, referred to as "mode 2", is chosen.  This mode
   achieves freshness by exchanging random values (nonces), and in
   absence of asymmetric cryptography mode 2 is notably efficient.  In a
   nutshell, mode 1 provides a better security strength but higher
   computational costs, whereas mode 2 performs very fast but with fewer
   security strength.  See section 4 for more details.

   The notation introduced by [SKEME] is maintained to avoid confusion.
   There is a collision-resistant hash function, H, a pseudorandom
   function using key Ko, F_Ko, and as parameters for the DH key
   exchange g, x, y, m, where g is the generator, m the modulus, and x
   and y are the client's and EAP server's private DH key, respectively.
   In EAP-SKL, H is SHA-1 and F_Ko over message M is SHA-1(Ko.M).

   In the next section, the two modes of EAP-SKL are described.  For
   mode 2, the session key is computed via

   SK =F_Ko(F_Ko(value_S.value_P.id_P.id_S)),

   that is, a keyed PRF is applied twice on an input.  This idea has
   finally lead to the HMAC-construction.  A HMAC (hash-based MAC) over
   the input "text" is defined as

   HMAC(K;text) = H(K XOR opad .  H(K XOR ipad . text)).

   The output of SHA-1 and subsequently of HMAC-SHA1 is 160 bit.

   As recommended in [RFC2104], the length of K should be equal to the
   hash output length, less is explicitely discouraged (as itwould
   decrease the the security strength).  Therefore, EAP-SKL mandates the
   length of Ko to be 160 bit.

   Furthermore, SK corresponds to the EAP Master Key (MK), which remains
   solely within the EAP method.

   Finally, the DH key exchange parameters have been chosen in
   accordance to [RFC3766].  The strength of the DH key exchange is
   based on the modulus size as well as the exponent size.  An 3000-bit
   MODP public-key scheme corresponds roughly to a 128-bit symmetric-key
   scheme.  EAP-SKL utilizes the 3072-bit MODP Group (id 15), defined in
   [RFC3526].  According to [RFC3526], the exponent size used in the DH
   key exchange should have double the entropy of the strength of the
   entire system, in particular the size of any symmetric key that will
   be derived from it (SK, MSK, EMSK).  Since EAP-SKL has an effective
   key strength of 128 bit, the DH exponents (private keys) MUST have at
   least 256 bit.  As cyclic group, g=2 is chosen (has advantage for
   hardware accelerated computation).

            -------------+--------------------

   Figure 1

   The rest of this section provides further details about the two
   modes.

   Before any run of EAP-SKL, client and EAP server must agree on some
   160-bit pre-shared key, referred to as Ko.  How Ko is established, is
   beyond the scope of EAP-SKL and thus must be realized by some secure
   out-of-band mechanism.  At the end of a successful authentication,
   both client and EAP server have independently derived a session key,
   SK, in length of 160 bit.  This key in turn is adequately expanded to
   generate the required keying material, that is a 64-byte MSK and a
   64-byte EMSK.

   This is realized by a pseudorandom function, T-PRF, which is based on
   SHA-1 and widely accepted.  EAP-FAST and PEAP make, for instance, use
   of this function.  Please see Appendix A for internals of T-PRF.

   T-PRF is invoked with the parameters (Key, S, OutputLength), where S
   = label + 0x00 + seed.

   EAP-SKL calls T-PRF with the following parameters: TPRF(Ko, "EAP-SKL"
   +0x00+ SK, 128).

   Since T-PRF generates in each iteration 20 byte random data, EAP-SKL
   let T-PRF iterate 7 times and then skip the last 12 byte.  Figure 2

3.  Protocol Overview

   The message flow of EAP-SKL is shown in Figure 3.  The conversation
   begins with the exchange of EAP Identity messages, where "id" is
   reserved for special tasks, like routing purposes or session
   resumption.

   P <--- S: EAP-Request/Identity                                   (1)
   P ---> S: EAP-Response/Identity(id)                              (2)
   P <--- S: EAP-Request/EAP-SKL (Start)                            (3)
   P ---> S: EAP-Response/EAP-SKL (id_P,value_P)                    (4)
   P <--- S: EAP-Request/EAP-SKL(id_S,value_S,
                 F_Ko(value_P.value_S.id_S.id_P))                   (5)
   P ---> S: EAP-Response(F_Ko(value_S.value_P.id_P.id_S))          (6)
   P <--- S: EAP-Success                                            (7)

   Figure 3

   The respective values of value_S and value_P and thus the derivation
   of SK depend on the chosen mode (Figure 4).


          | PFS | value_P | value_S | SK        | H(M)    | F_Ko(M)
   -------+-----+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------
   mode 1 | yes | g^x     | g^y     | H(g^xy)   |         |
   -------+-----+---------+---------+-----------+ SHA-1(M)| SHA-1(Ko.M)
   mode 2 | no  | nonce_P | nonce_S | F_Ko(arg) |         |
   -------+-----+---------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------

   where arg = F_Ko(value_S.value_P.id_P.id_S).

   Figure 4

   The choice of the mode is left solely to the EAP server.  The client
   finds this out by the type of the received TLV payload in message
   (3).  If the client does not agree with the proposed mode, he
   indicates this by sending EAP-Response/Nak. Subsequently, the
   authentication conversation is aborted.

   After the initial identity request/response, the EAP server sends in
   message 3 an indication which mode to choose.  In Message 4, the peer
   sends his freshness parameter (either a DH public key or a nonce).
   Message 5 contains the server`s identity, the server`s freshness
   parameter, and a MAC.  This is verified by the peer, if the
   verification is successful, it responds with message 6, which also
   contains a MAC.  The EAP server does the same computatation.  If the
   outcome is equal to received MAC, the EAP server is sure to talk to a
   legitimate client and finish the EAP conversation with an EAP-

   Success.  Otherwise, the authentication has failed and an EAP-Failure
   is sent.

   The derivation of SK is, in general SK=F_Ko(arg).  But for mode 1,
   [SKEME] offers the alternative SK=H(g^xy), which is chosen here.

   For mode 1, it holds SK = H(g^(xy)) = SHA-1(g^xy).

   For mode 2, we have

   SK = F_Ko(arg) = F_Ko(F_Ko(value_S.value_P.id_P.id_S)) =^!  HMAC-
   SHA1(Ko;arg).

   Note that the client has already computed "arg" in message (4) and
   thus can reuse the result, which would save computational costs.

4.  Packet formats

   EAP-SKL messages are encapsulated within the payload of EAP-Request
   and EAP-Response frames, respectively.  Therefore, a generic Type-
   length-value (TLV) attribute format is chosen (figure Figure 5).

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   :        value (contd.)                             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Length contains the length of the TLV in byte.

   | attribute name| type   | used for                | payload size  |

   | AT_START      | 0      | start                   | 1 byte        |
   | AT_ID         | 1      | id_P                    | max. 607 byte |
   | AT_NONCE      | 2      | nonce_P, nonce_S        | 384 byte      |
   | AT_DH         | 3      | DH public key, g^x, g^y | 384 byte      |
   | AT_MAC        | 4      | HMAC-SHA1               | 20 byte       |
   +---------------+--------+-------------------------+---------------+

   Figure 6

   That is, the EAP packet payload of messages (2)-(6) consists of one
   or more TLVs, as shown in Figure 7.  In case of mode 1, messages (3)
   and (4) contain AT_DH TLVs, in case of mode 2 AT_NONCE TLVs.
   AT_START has a payload of one byte, 0x01 for mode 1, 0x02 for mode 2.

   P <--- S: AT_START                          (3)

   This section briefly considers the computational costs for the
   client.  Modular exponentiations are known to be computationally
   expensive, SHA-1 computations are in contrast to this very
   lightweight.


          | mod exp. | SHA-1
   -------+----------+------
   mode 1 |    2     |  9
   -------+----------+------
   mode 2 |    0     |  11
   -------+----------+------

   Figure 8

   In mode 1, the peer performs 9 SHA-1 calculations, namely 1x for
   computing the MAC in message 6, 1x for verification of the MAC in
   message 5, and 7x for T-PRF.  In mode 2, the peer requires 11 SHA-1
   calculations.  Overall, especially the computational costs of mode 2
   become obvious.

   Next, we consider the amount of bytes what each side generates and
   transmits.  Only messages 3 to 6 are analyzed.  An EAP-Request or
   EAP-Response frame consists of the fields Code, Identifier, Length,
   Type, which are 1+1+2+1=5 bytes in total, followed by a variable
   length payload.  Only this payload is considered.


    size/byte |        | mode 1  | mode 2
   -----------+--------+---------+---------
              | msg 4  | 390+idP | 390+idP
      peer    +--------+---------+---------
              | msg 6  |   23    |   23
   -----------+--------+---------+---------
              | msg 3  |   4     |   4
      EAP     +--------+---------+---------
      server  | msg 5  | 413+idS | 413+idS
   -----------+--------+---------+----------

   Figure 9

   The Diffie-Hellman public key with 384 byte (=3072 bit) size must be
   considered as heavyweight, compared to the lightweight EAP frame
   structure.  An EAP-Request (resp. Response) has 5+sizeof(payload)
   bytes length, an EAP-Success or EAP-Failure only 4 bytes.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section analyzes the security of EAP-SKL.  In particular, it is
   shown that EAP-SKL complies with all mandatory requirements for EAP
   methods used in IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN deployments, as outlined in
   RFC 4017.

   Mechanism:

      EAP-SKL belongs to the category of pre-shared key EAP methods.


   Mutual authentication:

      EAP-SKL provides mutual authentication.  If both parties can
      verify the received HMAC, the other side is identified and
      authenticated.  Since the MAC is computed over a string which
      contains fresh random values previously generated, both MACs are
      interlocked adequately.


   Key derivation:
      EAP-SKL generates the required keying material, namely a 64 byte
      MSK and a 64 byte EMSK, which are exported for derivation of
      further keying material.


   Replay protection:
      EAP-SKL is resistant to replay attacks.
      Assume an attacker has captured a whole, successful conversation
      of EAP-SKL.  First, we investigate what happens if the attacker
      wants to impersonate the legitimate client.  If value_S of the
      captured session is different from the current one, the attack
      fails in computing the MAC in message (4).  Suppose now, value_S
      is the same.  It follows that replay of the captures message (4)
      as well as (6) are recognized as valid ones by the EAP server and
      thus the attacker will receive an EAP-Success.  Unfortunately, he
      can not derive from HMAC-SHA1(Ko;"success".SK) the session key SK
      and thus can not derive MSK and EMSK.  The attack ends here, that
      is although the EAP authentication has been successful, subsequent
      conversation attempts will fail.

      This replay attack is avoided by strengthening the server's
      implementation.  The space for value_P is large enough to reject
      any authentication request with the same value_P. Therefore, the
      server implementation should maintain a table with all previously
      received (id_P,value_P) pairs.  With this precaution, a replayed
      session is recognized as a such and appropriate countermeasures

      can take place.


   Confidentiality:
      EAP-SKL does not provide confidentiality in terms of [RFC3748],
      section 7.2.1.  The term "confidentiality" refers to encryption of
      EAP messages and successful and failure result indications.


   Key strength:
      The effective key strength of EAP-SKL is 128 bit (see also Section
      2).


   Resistance to dictionary attacks:
      EAP-SKL relies on a pre-shared key, which consists of random data.
      It is highly discouraged to generate this random data from a
      dictionary entry by applying some pseudorandom function.


   Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks:
      If the link layer is a shared media, there is generally a
      possibility for a third party (MitM) to place between two parties
      who want to communicate.  The trust relation is established by
      deriving some common secret, which a third party can not derive
      from the captured conversation.  For EAP-SKL, this is the session
      key SK, whose lifetime is the session.  Without knowledge of Ko
      this common secret can not be derived.  And without knowledge of
      Ko and SK, both MSK and EMSK can not be derived.

      Assume now, a MitM sits between peer and EAP Server, and
      intercepts all server messages and relays them to the peer.  This
      works fine for the whole conversation, that is for messages (1) to
      (7).  But, since the MitM does not know SK, this attack has only
      denial-of-service character.


   Protected ciphersuite negotiation:
      EAP-SKL does not support ciphersuite negotiation.


   Fast reconnect:
      EAP-SKL does not support fast reconnect.

   Cryptographic binding:
      EAP-SKL performs exactly one authentication and hence this
      technique is not applicable.


   Fragmentation:
      An EAP method may assume a mimimum EAP MTU of 1020 byte.  Message
      (4) is the largest one.  An EAP Request or Response packet begins
      with four fields (Code, Identifier, Length and Type), with total 5
      byte, followed by the payload. value_P as modulo 3072 can be at
      most 384 byte, and finally HMAC-SHA1 produces a 20-byte MAC.
      These are 409 byte, so that AT_ID MAY NOT exceed 1020-409=611
      byte.  The encapsulated id_P thus may not exceed 611-4=607 byte.


   End-user identity hiding:
      EAP-SKL does not provide end-user identity hiding.  The identity
      of the client is sent in plaintext.

Appendix A.  T-PRF

   The following description of T-PRF corresponds to [I-D.cam-winget-
   eap-fast], Appendix A.

   PRF(key, label, seed) = HMAC-SHA1(key, label + "\0" + seed)

   Where '+' indicates concatenation and "\0" is a NULL character.
   Label is intended to be a unique label for each different use of the
   T-PRF.

   To generate the desired OutputLength octet length of key material,
   the T-PRF is iterated as follows:

   T-PRF (Key, S, OutputLength) = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + ...

   Where S = label + 0x00 + seed; and

      T1 = HMAC-SHA1 (Key, S + OutputLength + 0x01)

      T2 = HMAC-SHA1 (Key, T1 + S + OutputLength + 0x02)

      T3 = HMAC-SHA1 (Key, T2 + S + OutputLength + 0x03)

      T4 = HMAC-SHA1 (Key, T3 + S + OutputLength + 0x04)

   OutputLength is a two octet value that is represented in big endian
   order.  The NULL character, 0x00 shall be present when a label string
   is provided.

   Since each Ti generates 20 byte of keying material, the last Tn is
   truncated to accommodate the desired length specified by
   OutputLength.  EAP-SKL has to derive 128 byte, so i is set to 7 and
   the last 12 byte are skipped.
