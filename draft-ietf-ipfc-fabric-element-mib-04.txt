2. Abstract


This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it defines the objects for managing the
operations of the Fabric Element portion of the Fibre Channel Standards.

This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to
the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
definitions.

3. Overview

A Fibre Channel Fabric is an entity which interconnects Node Ports
(N_Ports) or Node Loop Ports (NL_Ports).  It provides transport and
routing functions.  In essence, a Fabric is a network of N_Ports and/or
NL_Ports to communicate with one another.  A Fabric is composed of one
or more Fabric Element that are interconnected via Inter-element Links
(IEL).  A Fabric Element is the smallest unit of a Fabric that meets the
definition of a Fabric.  It must consist of at least three external
ports to connect to either N_Ports, NL_Ports or other Fabric Elements.
In general, a Fabric Element port may be of one of the following types:


(1)  F_Port, a fabric port to connect to an N_Port ([1]);

(2)  FL_Port, a fabric port that also supports a FC Arbitrated Loop
     consisting of one or more NL_Ports ([4]).

(3)  E_Port, an expansion port to connect to another Fabric Element
     ([2], [12]);


This memo shall define objects related to a Fabric Element, its F_Ports
and FL_Ports.  Objects related to other types of FC ports shall be
defined in future.

For the rest of the document, the term, "FxPort", will be used to refer
to both F_Port and FL_Port where the distinction is not necessary.  The
term, "NxPort" will be used to refer to both N_Port and NL_Port in the
similar fashion.

3.1. Management View of a Fabric Element

>From the management perspective, it is helpful to view a Fabric Element
to be consisting of multiple "modules".  Each module is a grouping,
either physical or logical, of one or more ports that may be managed as
a sub-entity within the Fabric Element.

This module mapping is recommended but optional.  A vendor may elect to
put all ports into a single module, or to divide the ports into modules
that do not match physical divisions.

The object fcFeModuleCapacity, which has a maximum value of 256,
indicates the maximum number of modules that a given Fabric Element may
contain.  This value must remain constant from one management restart to
the next.

INTERNET DRAFT            FC Fabric Element MIB         November 2, 1998


Each module is uniquely identified by a module number in the range of 1
through fcFeModuleCapacity inclusive.  Modules may come and go without
causing a management reset (of sysUpTime), and may be sparsely numbered
within the Fabric Element.  That is, the module numbering is not
required to be contiguous.  For instance, if a module is mapped
physically to a field-replaceable card and in a 13-card cage Fabric
Element, cards 3, 5, 6 and 7 may be installed.  The vendor may choose to
label them as modules 3, 5, 6 and 7 respectively.  In this example, the
value of fcFeModuleCapacity is 13.

A Fabric Element may also provide a proxy management on behalf of
another management entity by presenting it as one of its Fabric Element
modules.

The object fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity, which has a maximum value of 256,
indicates the maximum number of ports that a given module may contain.
The value of fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity must not change for a given
module.  However, a module may be deleted from the Fabric Element and
replaced with a module containing a different number of ports.  The
value of fcFeModuleLastChange will indicate that a change took place.

Each port within the Fabric Element is uniquely identified by a
combination of module index and port index, where port index is an
integer in the range 1..fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity.  As with modules
within a Fabric Element, ports within a module may be sparsely numbered.
That is the port numbering is not required to be contiguous.  Likewise,
ports may come and go within a module without causing a management
reset.

In terms of attachment, an F_Port will be attached to another N_Port;
and an FL_Port will be attached to one or up to 126 NL_Ports.  In
general, an FxPort may be attached to one or more NxPorts.  Each NxPort
associated with an FxPort will be uniquely identified by a combination
of module index, FxPort index and NxPort index.  An NxPort index is an
integer in the range (1..126).  The following diagram illustrates the
management view of a Fabric Element.

3.2. Structure of the Fabric Element MIB

This memo assumes that a Fabric Element has an SNMP entity (manager,
agent, or proxy agent) associated with its managed objects.  The managed
objects are divided as follow:

        - the Configuration group
        - the Operation group
        - the Error group
        - the Accounting group
        - the Capability group

In each group, scalar objects and table entries are defined.

The Configuration group contains configuration and service parameters
for the Fabric Element, modules and the FxPorts.

The Operation group contains the operational status and parameters of an
FxPort.  The group also contains the service parameters that have been
established between the FxPort and its attached NxPort, if applicable.

The Error group contains counters tracking various types of errors
detected by each FxPort.  The information may be used for diagnostics
and/or to derive the quality of the link between an FxPort and one or
more attached NxPorts.

The Accounting group contains statistic data suitable for deriving
accounting and performance information.

The Capability group contains parameters indicating the inherent
capability of the Fabric Element and each FxPort.

4. Application of MIB-II to Fabric Element


4.1. The System Group

For the purposes of the sysServices object in the System Group of MIB-II
[9], Fibre Channel is a data link layer protocol.  Thus, for a Fabric
Element, sysServices will have an integer value "2" or higher.

4.2. The Interface Group

The Interface Group of MIB-II defines generic managed objects for
managing interfaces.  Although each FxPort of a Fabric Element is an
interface, either the mapping of some interface objects are
inappropriate or the definition of some interface objects are
insufficient for Fibre Channel.  Therefore the Interface Group of MIB-II
will not be mapped in this memo.

4.3. The SNMP Group

The SNMP Group of MIB-II is mandatory for a Fabric Element that supports
an SNMP management entity.
