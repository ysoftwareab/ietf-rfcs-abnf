      IS-IS Route Preference for Extended IP and IPv6 Reachability
                draft-ietf-isis-route-preference-02.txt

Abstract

   Existing specifications as regards route preference are not explicit
   when applied to IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Type/Length/Value
   (TLVs).  There are also inconsistencies in the definition of how the
   up/down bit applies to route preference when the prefix advertisement
   appears in Level 2 Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs).  This
   document addresses these issues.

   This document, if approved, updates RFC 5308.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft            isis-route-preference             October 2015


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5302] defines the route preferences rules as they apply to TLVs
   128 and 130.  [RFC5305] introduced the IP Extended Reachability TLV
   135 but did not explicitly adapt the route preference rules defined
   in [RFC5302] for the new TLV.  [RFC5308] defines the IPv6
   Reachability TLV 236 and does include an explicit statement as
   regards route preference - but the statement introduces use of the
   up/down bit in advertisements which appear in Level 2 LSPs which is
   inconsistent with statements made in [RFC5302] and [RFC5305].  This
   document defines explicit route preference rules for TLV 135, revises
   the route preferences rules for TLV 236, and clarifies the usage of
   the up/down bit when it appears in TLVs in Level 2 LSPs.  This
   document is viewed as a clarification (NOT correction) of [RFC5302]
   and [RFC5305] and a correction of the route preference rules defined
   in [RFC5308] to be consistent with the rules for IPv4.  It also makes
   explicit that the same rules apply for the Multi-Topology(MT)
   equivalent TLVs 235 and 237.

2.  Use of the up/down Bit in Level 2 LSPs

   The up/down bit was introduced in support of leaking prefixes
   downwards in the IS-IS level hierarchy.  Routes which are leaked
   downwards have the bit set to 1.  Such prefixes MUST NOT be leaked
   upwards in the hierarchy.  So long as we confine ourselves to a
   single IS-IS instance and the current number of supported levels
   (two) it is impossible to have a prefix advertised in a Level 2 LSP
   and have the up/down bit set to 1.  However, because [RFC5302]
   anticipated a future extension to IS-IS which might support
   additional levels it allowed for the possibility that the up/down bit
   might be set in a Level-2 LSP and in support of easier migration in
   the event such an extension was introduced Section 3.3 stated:

   "...it is RECOMMENDED that implementations ignore the up/down bit in
   L2 LSPs, and accept the prefixes in L2 LSPs regardless of whether the
   up/down bit is set."

   [RFC5305] addressed an additional case wherein an implementation
   included support for multiple virtual routers running IS-IS in
   different areas.  In such a case it is possible to redistribute
   prefixes between two IS-IS instances in the same manner that prefixes
   are redistributed from other protocols into IS-IS.  This introduced
   the possibility that a prefix could be redistributed from Level 1 to
   Level 1 (as well as between Level 2 and Level 2) and in the event the
   redistributed route was leaked from Level 1 to Level 2 two different
   routers in different areas would be advertising the same prefix into
   the Level 2 sub-domain.  To prevent this [RFC5305] specified in
   Section 4.1:



Ginsberg, et al.         Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 3]

   "If a prefix is advertised from one area to another at the same
   level, then the up/down bit SHALL be set to 1."

   However, the statement in [RFC5302] that the up/down bit is ignored
   in Level 2 LSPs is not altered by [RFC5305].

   The conclusion then is that there is no "L2 inter-area route" - and
   indeed no such route type is defined by [RFC5302].  However,
   [RFC5308] ignored this fact and introduced such a route type in
   Section 5 when it specified a preference for " Level 2 down prefix".
   This is an error which this document corrects.  As changing the use
   of the up/down bit in TLVs 236 and 237 may introduce interoperability
   issues implementors may wish to support transition mechanisms from
   the [RFC5308] behavior to the behavior specified in this document.

3.  Types of Routes in IS-IS Supported by Extended Reachability TLVs

   [RFC5302] is the authoritative reference for the types of routes
   supported by TLVs 128 and 130.  However, a number of attributes
   supported by those TLVs are NOT supported by TLVs 135, 235, 236, 237.
   Distinction between internal/external metrics is not supported.  In
   the case of IPv4 TLVs (135 and 235) the distinction between internal
   and external route types is not supported.  However the Prefix
   Attribute Flags sub-TLV defined in [PFXATTR] reintroduces the
   distinction between internal and external route types.  The
   definitions below include references to the relevant attribute bits
   from [PFXATTR].

3.1.  Types of Routes Supported by TLVs 135 and 235

   This section defines the types of route supported for IPv4 when using
   TLV 135 [RFC5305] and/or TLV 235 [RFC5120].  The text follows as
   closely as possible the original text from [RFC5302].

   L1 intra-area routes: These are advertised in L1 LSPs, in TLV 135 or
   TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes are
   directly connected to the advertising router.  If the Prefix
   Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included both the X-Flag and the R-Flag
   are set to 0.

   L1 external routes: These are advertised in L1 LSPs, in TLV 135 or
   TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes are learned
   from other protocols and are usually not directly connected to the
   advertising router.  If the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV is
   included the X-Flag is set to 1 and the R-Flag is set to 0.

   L2 intra-area routes: These are advertised in L2 LSPs, in TLV 135 or
   TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes are

   directly connected to the advertising router.  If the Prefix
   Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included both the X-Flag and the R-Flag
   are set to 0.

   L1->L2 inter-area routes: These are advertised in L2 LSPs, in TLV 135
   or TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes are
   learned via L1 routing and were derived during the L1 Shortest Path
   First (SPF) computation from prefixes advertised in L1 LSPs in TLV
   135 or TLV 235.  If the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included
   the R-Flag is set to 1.

   L2->L2 inter-area routes: These are advertised in L2 LSPs, in TLV 135
   or TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 1 but is ignored and treated
   as if it were set to 0.  These IP prefixes are learned from another
   IS-IS instance usually operating in another area.  If the Prefix
   Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included the X-Flag is set to 1 and the
   R-Flag is set to 0.

   L2 external routes: These are advertised in L2 LSPs, in TLV 135 or
   TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  These IP prefixes are learned
   from other protocols and are usually not directly connected to the
   advertising router.  If the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV is
   included the X-Flag is set to 1 and the R-Flag is set to 0.

   L2->L1 inter-area routes: These are advertised in L1 LSPs, in TLV 135
   or TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 1.  These IP prefixes are
   learned via L2 routing and were derived during the L2 SPF computation
   from prefixes advertised in TLV 135 or TLV 235.  If the Prefix
   Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included the R-Flag is set to 1.

   L1->L1 inter-area routes: These are advertised in L1 LSPs, in TLV 135
   or TLV 235.  The up/down bit is set to 1.  These IP prefixes are
   learned from another IS-IS instance usually operating in another
   area.  If the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included the X-Flag
   is set to 1 and the R-Flag is set to 0.

3.2.  Types of Routes Supported by TLVs 236 and 237

   This section defines the types of route supported for IPv6 when using
   TLV 236 [RFC5308] and/or TLV 237 [RFC5120].

   L1 intra-area routes: These are advertised in L1 LSPs, in TLV 236 or
   TLV 237.  The up/down bit is set to 0.  The external bit is set to 0.
   These IPv6 prefixes are directly connected to the advertising router.
   If the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included the R-Flag is set
   to 0.

   during the L1 Shortest Path First (SPF) computation from L1 external
   routes advertised in L1 LSPs in TLV 236 or TLV 237.  If the Prefix
   Attribute Flags sub-TLV is included the R-Flag is set to 1.

Appendix A.  Example Interoperability Issue

   This documents a real world interoperability issue which occurs
   because implementations from different vendors have interpreted the
   use of the up/down bit in Level 2 LSPs inconsistently.

    10/8 - R0 ----- R1 ----- R2 ----- R3 ----- R4 ---- 10/8
                                      |
                   Figure 1

   Considering Figure 1, both R0 and R4 are advertising the prefix 10/8.
   Two ISIS Level 2 instances are running on R3 to separate the network
   into two areas.  R3 is performing route-leaking and advertises
   prefixes from R4 to the other Level 2 process.  The network is using
   extended metrics (TLV135 defined in [RFC5305]).  R0 is advertising
   10/8 with metric 2000 and R3 advertises 10/8 with metric 100.  All
   links have a metric of 1.  When advertising 10/8 in its Level 2 LSP,
   R3 sets the down bit as specified in [RFC5305].

   R1, R2 and R3 are from three different vendors (R1->Vendor1,
   R2->Vendor2, R3->Vendor3).  During interoperability testing, routing
   loops are observed in this scenario.

   o  R2 has two possible paths to reach 10/8, Level 2 route with metric
      2002, up/down bit is 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with metric
      101, up/down bit is 1 (from R3).  R2 selects R1 as nexthop to 10/8
      because it prefers the route which does NOT have up/down bit set.

   o  R3 has two possible paths to reach 10/8, Level 2 route with metric
      2003, up/down bit is 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with metric
      101, up/down bit is 0 (from R4).  R3 selects R4 as nexthop due to
      lowest metric.

   o  R1 has two possible paths to reach 10/8, Level 2 route with metric
      2001, up/down bit is 0 (from R0) and Level 2 metric 102, up/down
      bit is 1 (from R3).  R1 selects R2 as nexthop due to lowest
      metric.

   When R1 or R2 try to send traffic to 10/8, packets are looping due to
   inconsistent routing decision between R1 and R2.
