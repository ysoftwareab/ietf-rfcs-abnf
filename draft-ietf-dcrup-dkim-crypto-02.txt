1.  Introduction

   Discussion Venue:    Discussion about this draft is directed to the
      dcrup@ietf.org [1] mailing list.

   DKIM [RFC6376] signs e-mail messages, by creating hashes of the
   message headers and content and signing the header hash with a
   digital signature.  Message recipients fetch the signature
   verification key from the DNS where it is stored in a TXT record.
   The defining documents specify a single signing algorithm, RSA
   [RFC3447], and recommends key sizes of 1024 to 2048 bits.  While 1024
   bit signatures are common, stronger signatures are not.  Widely used
   DNS configuration software places a practical limit on key sizes,
   because the software only handles a single 256 octet string in a TXT
   record, and RSA keys longer than 1156 bits don't fit in 256 octets.

   This document adds a new signing algorithm, Edwards-Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (EdDSA), which has much shorter keys than RSA for
   similar levels of security.  It also adds a new key representation,
   with the key itself in the signature and a shorter key fingerprint in
   the DNS.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft             DKIM Crypto Update                  June 2017


   Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234].  The ABNF
   tokens sig-a-tag-k, key-k-tag-type, and base64string are imported
   from [RFC6376].

3.  EdDSA-SHA256 Signing Algorithm

   The eddsa-sha256 signing algorithm computes a message hash as defined
   in section 3 of [RFC6376], and signs it with Ed25519, the EdDSA
   algorithm using the edwards25519 curve, as defined in in RFC 8032
   section 5.1 [RFC8032].  The signing algorithm is PureEdDSA as defined
   in RFC 8032 section 4, since the input to the signing algorithm has
   already been hashed.  The DNS record for the verification public key
   MUST have a "k=eddsa" or "k=eddsafp" tag to indicate that the key is
   an EdDSA rather than RSA key.

   The syntax of DKIM signature tags is updated as follows, where this
   rule replaces the existing rule for sig-a-tag-k:

       ABNF:

       sig-a-tag-k = "rsa" / "rsafp" / "eddsa" / "eddsafp"
             / x-sig-a-tag-k

   The syntax of DKIM key tags is updated as follows, where this rule
   replaces the existing rule for key-k-tag-type:

       ABNF:

       key-k-tag-type  = "rsa" / "rsafp" / "eddsa" / "eddsafp"
             / x-key-k-tag-type

4.  Public key fingerprints

   Rather than using a public key stored in the DNS, a signature MAY
   include the corresponding public key, with a fingerprint in the DNS.
   For an RSA signature, the Signing Algorithm is rsafp-sha256, or for
   an EdDSA signature the Signing Algorithm is eddsafp-sha256.  The DNS
   record contains a SHA-256 hash of the public key, stored in base64 in
   the p= tag.  The key type tag MUST be present and contains k=rsafp or
   k=eddsafp.

   k=    The public key (base64; REQUIRED).  White space is ignored in
         this value and MUST be ignored when reassembling the original
         key.

         ABNF:

         sig-k-tag       = %x6b [FWS] "=" [FWS] sig-k-tag-data
         sig-k-tag-data  = base64string

   Section 5.5 of [RFC6376], on computing the message hash and
   signature, is modified as follows: When creating a signature with a
   signing algorithm that uses a key fingerprint, the signer includes
   the public key in the signature as a base64 encoded string with a k=
   tag.  The key in the tag is the same one that would be published in a
   non-fingerprint key record.

   Section 3.7 of [RFC6376], on computing the message hashes, is not
   modified.  Since the key in the k= tag is known in advance, it
   included in the signature in the same manner as all of the other
   signature fields other than b=.

   Section 6.1.3 of [RFC6376], to compute the verification, is modified
   as follows: In item 4, if the signing algorithm uses a key
   fingerprint, extract the verification key from the k= tag.  If there
   is no such tag, the signature does not validate.  Extract the key
   hash from the p= tag of the key record.  If there is no such tag or
   the tag is empty, the signature does not validate.  Compute the
   SHA-256 hash of the verification key, and compare it to the value of
   the key hash.  If they are not the same, the signature does not
   validate.  Otherwise proceed to verify the signature using the
   validation key and the algorithm described in the "a=" tag.

5.  Key and algorithm choice and strength

   Section 3.3 of [RFC6376] describes DKIM's hash and signature
   algorithms.  It is updated as follows:

   Signers MUST NOT implement and verifiers SHOULD NOT implement the
   rsa-sha1 algorithm.  Signers SHOULD implement and verifiers MUST
   implement the rsafp-256, eddsa-sha256, and eddsafp-sha256 algorithms.

   Signers that use rsa-sha256 signatures MUST use keys at least 1024
   bits long and SHOULD use keys 2048 bits long.  Verifiers MUST NOT
   accept rsa-sha256 signatures with keys less than 1024 bits long.

6.  Transition Considerations

   For backward compatibility, signers MAY add multiple signatures that
   use old and new signing algorithms or key representations.  Since
   there can only be a single key record in the DNS for each selector,
   the signatures will have to use different selectors, although they
   can use the same d= and i= identifiers.

7.  Security Considerations

   EdDSA and key fingerprints are widely used cryptographic techniques,
   so the security of DKIM signatures using new signing algorithms
   should be at least as good as those using old algorithms.  Since key
   fingerprints make it possible to publish verification records for RSA
   keys of any length, rsafp signatures SHOULD use key lengths of 1536
   or 2048 bits.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update registries as follows.
