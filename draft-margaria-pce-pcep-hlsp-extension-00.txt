         PCEP Procedures for Hierarchical Label Switched Paths
               draft-margaria-pce-pcep-hlsp-extension-00

Abstract

   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) set up in Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) or Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks can be used to form links
   to carry traffic in those networks or in other (client) networks.
   These LSPs can be referred to as Hierarchical LSPs (H-LSP).  H-LSPs
   allow to improve the scalability of MPLS/GMPLS networks by creating
   hierarchies of TE-LSPs.  Those hierarchies are an important state for
   optimal TE-Computation, therefore a stateful PCE should be able to
   discover and manage those H-LSPs.  A PCE having a global view of the
   network, including Forwarding Adjacencies LSP (FA-LSP) and non FA-
   LSPs, can create more optimal hierachies and (re-)compute the TE-LSPs
   path to make use of the H-LSPs.  In particular a PCE can better
   leverage the Private H-LSP introduced by RFC6107 without influencing
   the IGP, allowing a less disruptive use of Hierarchies.

   RFC6107 defined Protocol mechanisms to facilitate the establishment
   of such LSPs and to bundle traffic engineering (TE) links to reduce
   the load on routing protocols.

   This document defines PCEP extensions to learn about and control
   those H-LSPs.

Internet-Draft                 PCEP H-LSPs                    March 2016


1.  Introduction

   Traffic Engineering (TE) links in a Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) or a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) network may be constructed from
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) [RFC6107].  Such LSPs are defined as
   hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs).

   The mechanisms described in [RFC6107] enables the dynamically
   construction of provisioned hierarchical networks.  The Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) defined in [RFC5440], [RFC5521],
   [RFC5541], [RFC5520], [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   enable a PCE to compute paths for a range of switching technologies
   in a stateless and statefull manner, but does not allow a PCE to
   control the hierarchy of such LSPs.  This document complements those
   RFCs to control H-LSPs.

   This document provides the same level of control as [RFC6107], so
   that the PCE can provide the following information to the LSPs
   endpoints:

      Whether the LSP is an ordinary LSP or an H-LSP.

      In which IGP instances the LSP should be advertised as a link.

      How the client networks should make use of H-LSP and corresponding
      TE-links.

      Whether the TE-link should form part of a bundle (and if so, which
      bundle).

      How the link endpoints should be identified when advertised.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Solution overview

   The encoding and semantics associated with the control of H-LSPs is
   already considered and defined by [RFC6107].  This document reuses
   those definitisns and adapts them to PCEP.  The following section
   describes the new PCEP new objects and associated procedures.

2.  H-LSP capability advertisement

2.1.  PCE Discovery Protocol

   IGP-based PCE Discovery (PCED) is defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089]
   for the OSPF and IS-IS protocols.  A new flag (bit TBA-1) is defined
   to advertise the H-LSP capability:

                           Bit   Capabilities

                         TBA-1 : H-LSP Capability

2.2.  OPEN Object extension HLSP-CAPABILITY TLV

   In addition to the IGP advertisement, a PCEP speaker SHOULD be able
   to discover the other peer GMPLS capabilities during the Open message
   exchange.  This capability is also useful to avoid misconfigurations.
   This document defines a new GMPLS-CAPABILITY TLV for use in the OPEN
   object to negotiate the H-LSP capability.  The inclusion of this TLV
   in the OPEN message indicates that the PCC/PCE support the PCEP
   extensions defined in this document.  A PCE that is able to support
   the extensions defined in this document MUST include the HLSP-
   CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN message.  If a PCEP Peer does not include
   the HLSP-CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN message and the other PCEP peer
   does include the TLV, it is RECOMMENDED that each peer indicates a
   mismatch of capabilities.  If any of the peers do not advertise the
   HLSP-CAPABILITY TLV, the extension defined in this document MUST NOT
   be used.

   IANA has allocated value TBA-2 from the "PCEP TLV Type Indicators"
   sub-registry, as documented in Section 5.2 ("New PCEP TLVs").  The
   description is "HLSP-CAPABILITY".  Its format is shown in the
   following figure.

3.  PCEP object and extensions

   This section describes the required PCEP objects and extensions.  The
   PCReq and PCRep messages are defined in [RFC5440].  The PCRpt and
   PCUpd messages are defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and the
   PCInitiate in [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].  The control of H-LSP
   by a PCE will reuse and adapt the information, encoding and procedure
   described in [RFC6107].  This document defines the
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID PCEP object for that purposea and it is
   carried in the following messages:

      PCReq: The PCC indicates that it will form a H-LSP.

      PCRep: If the object was present in the corresponding PCReq, the
      PCE may suggest IDs.

      PCRpt: The PCC reports the state of the H-LSP.

      PCUpd: The PCE requests the LSP to be used as H-LSP.

      PCInitiate: The PCE requests the creation of a H-LSP.

3.1.  The PCReq message

   The PCReq MAY include the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object.  Multiple
   instances of the object MAY be included in the message, in case
   multiple IGP instances are the target, following [RFC6107], section
   3.4.  The presence of the object indicates that the PCC will setup
   the TE-LSP as a H-LSP.  This MAY be used by the PCE as policy input.
   The PCC MAY set the IDs to 0, as described in Section 3.6.1.

   The PCReq is modified as follows:

    <request>::= <RP>
                 <END-POINTS>
                [<LSPA>]
                [<BANDWIDTH>]
                [<metric-list>]
                [<OF>]
                [<RRO>[<BANDWIDTH>]]
                [<IRO>]
                [<LOAD-BALANCING>]
                [<XRO>]
                [<LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID>...]

Internet-Draft                 PCEP H-LSPs                    March 2016


3.2.  The PCRep message

   The PCE MAY include the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object from the
   corresponding PCReq.  The PCE MUST NOT include the
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID if it was not present in the corresponding
   PCReq.  If the IDs were set to 0 on request, the PCE SHOULD provide a
   recommended value, as described in Section 3.6.1.

   The PCRep uses the <attribute-list> definition, which is extended as
   follows:

     <attribute-list>::=[<LSPA>]
                        [<BANDWIDTH>]
                        [<metric-list>]
                        [<IRO>]
                        [<LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID>...]


3.3.  The PCRpt message

   The PCRpt MAY include the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object.  Multiple
   instances of the object MAY be included in the message, in the case
   where multiple IGP instances are the target, following [RFC6107],
   section 3.4 or to report the ingress and egress IDs.  The presence of
   the object indicates that the PCC will setup the TE-LSP as a H-LSP.
   If the LSP object O(Operational) flag is DOWN, the PCC MAY set the
   IDs to 0, as described in Section 3.6.1.  If the LSP object O flag is
   UP or ACTIVE the PCC SHOULD report at least 2
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_IDs for a given target IGP instance, one for
   ingress and one for egress.

   The PCRpt uses the <attribute-list> definition, which is extended as
   described in Section 3.2.

3.4.  The PCUpd message

   The PCUpd MAY include the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object.  Multiple
   instances of the object MAY be included in the message, in the case
   where multiple IGP instances are the target, following [RFC6107],
   section 3.4 or to report the ingress and egress IDs.  The presence of
   the object indicates that the PCC SHOULD setup the TE-LSP as a H-LSP.
   The PCE MUST NOT include any object type for the egress node.  If the
   PCE includes the object type for the egress node the PCC MUST send a
   PCErr with error type TBA-5(PCC Hierarchy Issue) and error value
   1(Egress LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object type in PCUp, PCRep or
   PCInitiate message).  The PCE MAY set the IDs in accordance to
   Section 3.6.1.

Internet-Draft                 PCEP H-LSPs                    March 2016


   The PCUpd use the <attribute-list> definition, which is extended as
   described in Section 3.2

   Upon receipt of a PCUpd message with LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID, the PCC
   SHOULD try to setup the TE-LSP as a H-LSP based on its policies.  If
   the PCC ignores the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID, it MUST set the I bit.
   If the PCE requires the LSP to be an H-LSP, it MUST set the
   P(Processing) Flag in the object header.

   If the PCE is tearing down the LSP, the client LSPs may be impacted.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the PCC uses the Gracefull link shutdown
   procedures described in [RFC4203], [RFC5307] and [RFC5817].  It can
   be desirable for a PCE to know in advance if the LSP carries traffic
   before initiating the teardown as it would result in a smoother
   transition in the case where the gracefull teardown procedures are
   not used.  This indication is not a H-LSP specific operation and MAY
   be used in a more general context, therefore it is out of the scope
   of this document.

3.5.  The PCInitiate message

   The procedure for PCInitiate are the same as for PCUpd, described in
   Section 3.4.

3.6.  LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object

   IANA has allocated value TBA-3 from the "PCEP Objects" sub-registry,
   as documented in Section 5.1 ("New PCEP Object").  The description is
   "LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID".  The following object-type are defined by
   this document:

    Object-Type Description

         1      Ingress Unnumbered Links with Action Identification.
         2      Ingress IPv4 Numbered Links with Action Identification.
         3      Ingress IPv6 Numbered Links with Action Identification.
         4      Egress Unnumbered Links with Action Identification.
         5      Egress IPv4 Numbered Links with Action Identification.
         6      Egress IPv6 Numbered Links with Action Identification.

   The content and TLVs are those defined in [RFC6107].  The TLVs are
   not PCEP TLVs.

3.6.1.  Procedures

   In [RFC6107]  the interface IDs are allocated by the endpoints, this
   principle remains unchanged.  In the context of PCEP the PCE does not
   manage the PCC ids.  It may suggest IDs (numbered or unnumbered), but

Internet-Draft                 PCEP H-LSPs                    March 2016


   the PCC remains in control of these allocations.  The PCE can
   indicate to the PCC that the ID SHOULD be allocated by the PCC by
   setting the ID to the value of 0.  This applies to the following
   fields:

      Interface ID

      LSR's Router ID

      IPv4 Interface Address

      IPv6 Interface Address

      Component Link Identifier

      IPv4 Numbered Component Link Identification

      IPv6 Numbered Component Link Identification

   The PCE MAY only set the Object-type (OT) in the range of 1 to 3,
   while the OT range of 4 to 6 are reserved for reporting the reverse
   Ids assigned by the egress node.

   The ID MAY be 0 for OT 1 to 3 in the following cases:

   PCReq:  the PCC is indicating that the PCE SHOULD provide a value

   PCRep:  the PCE is indicating the PCC SHOULD do the allocation

   PCRpt:  when the LSP is DOWN or GOING-UP

   PCUpd:  the PCE is indicating the PCC SHOULD do the allocation

   PCInitiate:  the PCE is indicating the PCC SHOULD do the allocation

   In case where the PCC is not able to allocate an address suitable for
   the H-LSP, it MUST reply with a PCErr with type TBA-5 (PCC Hierarchy
   Issue), value 9 (PCC Cannot allocate a IPv4 Interface Address), value
   10 (PCC Cannot allocate a IPv6 Interface Address) or value 11 (PCC
   Cannot allocate an Unnumbered Interface Address).

   The ID MAY be set by the PCE for OT in range of 1 to 3 in the
   following cases:

   PCRep:  the PCE is suggesting and ID to be used

   PCUpd:  the PCE is suggesting and ID to be used

   PCInitiate:  the PCE is suggesting and ID to be used

   The PCC MAY use the suggested value.  If the value is not used, the
   PCC SHOULD send a PCErr with type TBA-5 (PCC Hierarchy Issue) and a
   value 2 ( Interface ID provided is invalid), 3 (LSR's Router ID
   provided is invalid), 4 (IPv4 Interface Address provided is invalid)
   5 (IPv6 Interface Address provided is invalid), 6 (Component Link
   Identifier provided is invalid), 7 (IPv4 Numbered Component Link
   Identification provided is invalid) or 8 (IPv6 Numbered Component
   Link Identification provided is invalid).

   The ID MUST NOT be 0 for OT 1 to 3 in the following cases:

   PCRpt  when the LSP is UP, ACTIVE or GOING-DOWN

4.  Additional Error Type and Error Values Defined

   A PCEP-ERROR object is used to report a PCEP error and is
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error while
   Error-value that provides additional information about the error.
   Additional errors types and error values are defined to represent
   some of the errors related to the newly identified objects.  For each
   PCEP error, an Error-Type and an Error-value are defined.  Error-Type
   1 to 10 are already defined in [RFC5440].  Two new Error-Type are
   introduced (value TBA-4 and TBA-5).
