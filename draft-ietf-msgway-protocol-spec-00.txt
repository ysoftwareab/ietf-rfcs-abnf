Abstract

   MessageWay's goal is to move data from a "Source" (a node on a
   System Area Network) to "a Destination" (another node, probably on
   another System Area Network).  Sources and Destinations can be
   physical things (a processor or a smart memory board).  They can
   also be "logical" things (a group of cooperating processes).

		    Part-1: MessageWay EEP messages
		    -------------------------------


MessageWay is an open family of specifications for internetworking
high performance System Area Networks (SANs) and high performance LANs. 

This part describes the packets of the EEP (End-to-End Protocol) part
of the MessageWay-protocol.  Other MessageWay layers, described in other
documents, include the MessageWay Server Layer.

Some basic MessageWay terminology requires explanation.  MessageWay
interconnects high performance System Area Networks (SANs).  Each SAN
contains some "nodes".  At least one node in each SAN is also a MessageWay
"router".  All routers contain a hardware link to a corresponding router
in another SAN.

MessageWay's goal is to move data from a "Source" (a node on a SAN) to
"a Destination" (another node, probably on another SAN).  Sources and
Destinations can be physical things (a processor or a smart memory
board).  They can also be "logical" things (a group of cooperating
processes).

Within each instance of MessageWay all nodes have unique 16-bit
MessageWay addresses.  These nodes include sources, destinations, and
routers.  SANs also have addresses.  A system designer can assign these
"MessageWay Addresses" manually.  Alternatively, the optional MessageWay
Server Layer provides a way to assign and discover addresses
dynamically.  Throughout this document "address" always means the 16-bit
MessageWay address.

SANs also may have Myrinet addresses, aka SAD-IDs.  They are also 16-bit
quantities, sharing the address space with the nodes.  These addresses,
of SANs and nodes, are unique within each instance of Myrinet.

To optimize for performance, MessageWay has a data transfer mode that
leverages the native message routing schemes used within the SANs.
This mode uses a "Planned Transfer" paradigm.  During the planning phase,
a source collects information on optimal routes to a destination,
expressed in the various native formats of the intervening SANs.
A source later uses this information for low latency transfers to that
destination.  In MessageWay, the transfer phase of a Planned Transfer
is called "L2-forwarding".  Appendix-C shows an example of the planning
phase.

MessageWay also optionally supports a more traditional data transfer
mode that requires no planning.  Such transfers specify the destinations
by their addresses only.  MessageWay calls this more traditional
approach "L3-forwarding".

MessageWay packets travel through SANs encapsulated inside the native
packet format of each SAN.

MessageWay packets get to their destinations by Level-2 (L2) forwarding,
Level-3 (L3) forwarding, or a combination thereof.
MsgWay-Msgs                      <02>                            MsgWay-WG


In L3-forwarding (similar to IP forwarding), the L2-routing through each
SAN is determined upon entering that SAN by prefixing the packet with
the L2-Routing-Header (such as a source route) corresponding to the
destination address specified in the packet.

In L2-forwarding the source prefixes the packet with all the L2-routing
headers needed along the path to the destination.


The MessageWay MESSAGE STRUCTURE
--------------------------------

(1) Optional Sequence of L2-Routing-Headers (L2RHs)
(2) EEP Header (16 bytes):
        Destination Address                        2 Bytes
        Priority                                   1 Byte
        Version/"Magic Cookie"                     1 Byte
        Packet Type                                2 Bytes
        Packet Type Extension                      2 Bytes
        Endianess and Pad Length                   1 Byte
        Data Length                                3 Bytes
        Source Address                             2 Bytes
        Free                                       2 Bytes
(3) Optional Data (in 8B-words)
        Data Block (including optional padding) 0-128 MBytes
(4) EEP Trailer (8 Bytes)
        Error Indication                           8 Bytes

The leading L2RHs, (1), are consumed by the SANs before reaching the
destination node which receives only the EEP header, (2), the data, (3),
and the EEP trailer, (4).  Unlike (2) and (3) that arrive exactly as
sent by the source, (4) may be modified along the way to the destination.

Each MessageWay packet is first L2-forwarded (zero or more times)
before being L3-forwarded (zero or more times).

MessageWay headers and trailers are always in Big Endian order.  
The byte order of the Data Block is undefined.

It is recommended for nodes to store MessageWay headers (and data)
aligned on 8-byte boundaries.  All the elements of MessageWay (L2RHs,
EEP-headers, data, and EEP-trailers) are always multiples of 8B-words.
.
MsgWay-WG                      <03>                            MsgWay-Msgs


MessageWay does not provide Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR).  Therefore, 
a packet cannot exceed the minimum MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) along 
its path.

MessageWay does not detect errors.  It only gathers error detection
information from the SANs and inter-SAN links that a packet transits.



THE FORMAT OF THE EEP HEADER
----------------------------

The MessageWay EEP header:

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Destination-Addr|Priority| Version|    Packet-type and extension      |MH
+---+----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| E | PL |  Data-Length (8B-words)  |  Source-Address |       Free      |
+---+----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
  4    4

The MessageWay EEP trailer:

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|      64 zero bits, unless any error was indicated along the path      |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+


THE DETAILS OF THE EEP HEADER AND TRAILER
-----------------------------------------

Destination Address (DA) unsigned 2 bytes

  This field contains the address of the destination.

  Addresses are unique within each instance of MessageWay.  Nodes
  should have addresses assigned to them.  The assignment of addresses
  to MessageWay nodes is not specified here.

  Examples of potentially addressable MessageWay nodes include: groups
  of cooperating processes, an entire MPP, or each of that MPP's many
  processors or processes.

  All routers must have addresses so that they can exchange control and
  configuration packets with other routers.

  "Logical Addresses" (for broadcast and for multicast groups) are also
  in this address space.  An address is a "Logical Address" if its MSbit
  is 1.

  This reserves (about) 32K:32K for node:logical addresses.  The use of
  2 MSbits to indicate logical addresses would change this to 48K:16K,
  with the ranges 0x0040-0xBFFF and 0xC000-0xFFFD.
MsgWay-Msgs                      <04>                            MsgWay-WG


  A few reserved address values have special static meanings.

  Address Ranges:

        0x0000        Illegal

        0x0001-0x003F Illegal, reserved for L2-Routing Headers.

	0x0040-0x7FFF Legal addresses for nodes and/or SANs

        0x8000-0xFFFD Logical addresses (for multicast, etc.)

        0xFFFE        ("Hey-You!") This address is used by routers
                      at power up to address adjacent routers, over
                      a point-to-point link.  ("If you receive it,
                      it's for you.")

        0xFFFF        (Broadcast) This address is reserved for broadcast
                      operations if we decide to add broadcast to the
                      specification.  ("If you receive it, it's for you.")


Priority (P) unsigned 1 byte

  All ones is the highest priority, and all zeroes the lowest.  Ideally,
  packets with higher priority should gain access to contested resources
  before packets with lower priority.  Implementations may ignore the
  Priority field.


Version (V) unsigned 1 byte

  This field is static and in this version should be set to 0x0005.
  We suggest implementations always verify the value of this field
  to help avoid mistakenly treating random data as a MessageWay header
  and to prevent problems when newer versions share the same MessageWay
  with older ones.


Packet Type (PT) unsigned 2 bytes

  The intent of the PT field is to provide all the information needed
  for demuxing in support of multiple protocol layers (such as in
  support of zero copy messages), hence eliminate the need for
  sequential demuxing.

  Thus, it is needed to define PT values that support popular parallel
  programming APIs such as MPI.

  The Enumeration Appendix (A1) defines several values for this PT field.

  Types that need more than 2 bytes, can use also the following 2 bytes
  of the Type Extension (TE) field and (if needed) also the 2 bytes of
  the Free (F) field.
MsgWay-WG                      <05>                            MsgWay-Msgs


  However, layered protocols cannot be ignored.  The PT field can also
  define data blocks as containing IP, SNMP, ATM, Ethernet, and other
  popular layered protocols.  The 2 MSBytes of the PT will be as used
  for that purpose throughout the internet (aka "ether-types").

  Here are the PT values a memory board will need:

    WRITE -- Treat the first few bytes of the Data Block as a Local
             memory-address and write the remaining data into memory.

     READ -- Treat the data block as a local memory-address and a
             byte count.  Generate a return WRITE packet containing
             the appropriate data.

  The PT field will also indicate the commands used in the MessageWay
  Router to Router configuration and control Protocol (RRP).

  We will define a special PT value that specifies that the Data Block
  contains an embedded MessageWay message, complete with another EEP
  header, and, potentially, prefixed L2-Routing-Headers.  This feature
  will allow L3-routing to an intermediate node, followed by L2-routing
  starting there to the final destination.

  Special Types

    RRP - MessageWay's Router-to-Router protocol (see Part-2).

    ERR - Error reporting packet, usually sent to the Source Address
          (SA, see below) in response to a MessageWay message that
          could not be properly handled, such as "Destination Unknown".
          The TE indicates the nature of the error (e.g., UNK) as
          defined in the Enumeration Appendix (A4).

Type Extension (TE) unsigned 2 bytes

  As described above, an extension of the preceeding PT field.

Endianess (E), 4 bits

  The idea is that if the SAN interface of the receiving-node detects
  Endianess that is different than its native one, then it may kick in
  byte-swapping hardware for N-byte words, saving much work for the
  receiving node.

  The first bit (MSbit) indicates if the message is in the Big Endians
  order (b0=0) or in the Little Endians order (b0=1).  The next 3 bits
  could control hardware byte swapping, if any, which assumes that all
  the data is of the same length.

	000: don't swap, it's 8 bits data
	001: swap as if all the data is  16 bit field
	010: swap as if all the data is  32 bit field
        011: swap as if all the data is  64 bit field
	100: swap as if all the data is 128 bit field
MsgWay-Msgs                      <06>                            MsgWay-WG


Pad Length (PL) unsigned integer, 4 bits

  Length in bytes of padding that were added at the end of the data
  block (i.e., from the end of the data to the end of the message).
  PL must be between 0 and 7.


Data Length (DL) unsigned 3 bytes

  Length of the data block (not including the EEP-header and trailer) in
  8B-words, including any optional padding.  Hence, the net length of
  the Data Block is 8*DL-PL bytes.  The minimum is zero, and the maximum
  length is (2^24-1)*8 bytes ~ 2^27 ~ 128 MBytes


Source Address (SA) unsigned short

  This field contains the address of the packet's original source in
  the same format as DA (except Logical Addresses).

  Filling in this field is optional.  A value of zero means SA is not
  specified.

  Routers may use this field to identify the sender to which error
  messages may be sent.


Free (F) 2 bytes

  Left free for an application to use anyway it wants.  Routers must not
  modify this field.  

  This F field may serve as an extension of the packet type (PT+TE),
  if needed.


Data Block (DB), 8*DL-PL bytes long

  Left free for an application to use anyway it wants.  Routers must
  not modify this field.  If the MessageWay header begins on an 8-byte
  boundary, the Data Block will also begin on an 8-byte boundary.
  Optional padding at the end of the Data Block should similarly align
  the trailing EI field.  It is recommended for nodes to store
  MessageWay headers (and data) aligned on 8-byte boundaries.

The above fields are in the EEP-header.  The following is in the
EEP-trailer:

Error Indication (EI) unsigned 8 bytes

  We allow routers to pass packets toward their destinations before
  detecting transmission errors (wormhole routing).  The EI field
  provides such routers with a means to append an error indication to
  the end of a packet.  An all zero value means no error indicated.
  Any non zero value indicates one or more errors.  A router never
  clears the EI field.
MsgWay-WG                      <07>                            MsgWay-Msgs



  The packet source will usually initialize the EI field to all zeros.
  However, as an alternative example, a memory board may create a packet
  with a non zero EI field (EI=1) that indicates a parity error was
  detected by the memory board.

  Each router does an arithmetic left shift, on the EI field, by one
  bit.  Routers that detect transmission errors also OR a one into the
  LSbit (after the shift).  This provides a record of which routers
  indicated errors.  For this scheme the memory board would set EI=1
  to indicate detected data errors.

  
MessageWay L2-ROUTING OPTION
----------------------------

A MessageWay source may specify native routes, by placing the native
routes before the MessageWay Header.  The native routes must appear
within a sequence of MessageWay L2-Routing-Headers (L2RH). 

The contents of the L2RH are totally SAN dependent, with the exception
of the first 2 bytes (L) indicating the length, in bytes, of that L2RH,
which should be smaller than 64.  Hence, its first byte is always 0, but
the next byte is not.  

It is up to each SAN to provide padding, if needed, to fill the L2RH
words.  The actual number of routing 8B-words in the L2RH is the
integer part of (L+9)/8.

Each L2RH is defined by the entity that will process it.  It may
include, in addition to routing information per se, also demuxing
information such as a local message-type.  For example, over Myrinet it
should end with 0x0300 which is the Myrinet Message-Type of MessageWay.

Since values smaller than 64 (0x0040) are illegal for Destination
Address (DA) the L-field also distinguishes between packets that start
with MessageWay packet headers (that require L3-forwarding) and packets
that start with L2RHs (that require L2-forwarding).

The L2 header must contain enough information to allow a router to
quickly create any necessary local routing headers and trailers.
MessageWay implementations that support L2-forwarding must document
their unique L2 header requirements.

When a MessageWay message is encapsulated inside any native SAN message
(Paragon and Myrinet, for example) it's up to that SAN to distinguish
between it and other native packets.  This is not a MessageWay issue.
For example, Myrinet uses its Message-Type to recognize MessageWay
messages.

Distinguishing between MessageWay and native packets (that start with an
L2RH) is a MessageWay task that is performed on the boundaries between
SANs, in the MessageWay routers upon entering each new SAN.

		    Part-2: MessageWay RRP messages
		    -------------------------------

MessageWay is an open family of specifications for internetworking
System Area Networks (SANs).  This part describes the packets of the
RRP (Router-to-Router Protocol) part of the MessageWay-protocol.
It is built on top of the MessageWay-EEP described in Part-1.

We introduce some new terminology within this document.  A MessageWay
Router will always bridge two SANs.  The Router consists of three parts:
the "Half Router" (HR) attached to the first SAN, the HR attached to the
second SAN, and their interconnection.

MessageWay does not define the nature of this interconnection.
However, we believe the PCI Local Bus de facto standard will become
a very popular link.

This document specifies a series of options that allow system designers
to deploy MessageWay routers of varying levels of intelligence.  Each
router is considered as a set of interconnected Half-Routers (HRs),
each being a full fledged address-bearing node on some SAN.

There are several implementation levels of MessageWay, for nodes and
for routers.  System designers may choose the level of implementation
to best suit their needs.  The higher the implementation level, the
more interoperability and adaptability result.

Node implementation levels:

    Level-A: Built-in L2 source routes
    Level-B: Built-in L3 addresses (dynamic update of first HR)
    Level-C: Requesting and receiving dynamic routing information

Level-A nodes send messages by using L2-forwarding, by specifying
SRs (in L2RHs) that are hard coded into them, without the ability
to dynamicly acquire or modify them.

Level-B nodes have also the ability to send messages by using
L3-forwarding, by specifying addresses that are hard coded into them,
without the ability to dynamicly acquire them.  These nodes can ask HRs
for the best first HR for any destination node (specified by its
address) and for the SR to it.  In addition they can also handle
Redirect messages, telling them which HR to use for given nodes.

Level-C nodes can also locate other nodes by asking HRs to provide the
attributes of nodes specified by addreses, names, and/or capabilities.
They also respond to such queries by reporting their own attributes.

Router implementation levels:

    Level-A: Forwarding according to L2 source routes
    Level-B: Handling L3 addresses, and dynamic first HR (redirect, etc)
    Level-C: Supporting dynamic routing by nodes
    Level-D: Dynamic inter-SAN routing, mapping, and discovery
RRP-Msgs                       <10>                            MsgWay-WG


HRs can support nodes of same (or lower) implementation level.
We design for the highest implementation levels, but expect that
some instances of MessageWay will use lower implementation levels.

Level-A routers support only L2-Forwarding, and do not support the
planning phase of Planned Transfers.  Therefore, systems which use
Level-A routers must have the necessary native routes hard coded (e.g.,
burned into a PROM somewhere).

Level-B routers also support L3-Forwarding, and advise nodes about the
first HR to use for each destination.

Level-C routers add the planning phase of Planned Transfers (by
supporting requests for routes).  Level-D routers exchange routing
information with each other, allowing dynamic discovery and adaptation.

........................................................................

The basic model of MessageWay is a set of SANs (System Area Networks),
each with its own conventions and protocols.

The interconnection between SANs is via MessageWay-routers.  A router
between the SAN-A and the SAN-B is composed of two interconnected
processes, each a fully fledged node on a SAN.  These processes known
as HRs ("Half-Routers") or "SAN-interfaces".

These HRs may be implemented by two separate "boxes" with an inter-SAN
communication link between them, or inside a single "multi-homed" box
that is interfaced to both SANs.

RRP defines (via message structure and behavior) the interactions
between HRs.  RRP does not define the lower level protocols that deliver
its messages (over links, or between processes in multi-homed routers).
In particular, RRP does not define the inter-SAN interconnection links
between the HRs that are left for mutual agreements among the
implementors.  These links are expected to range from serial fibers to
PCI buses.  A PPP-like protocol may be defined later for these links.

It is assumed that each HR has an RT for its own SAN (aka Local Routing
Table, LRT), with (at least) the addresses of all the nodes, and the
source routes to each of them from the HR.  This information could be
dynamic or static, even manually configured.  The HRs may (or may not)
perform dynamic mapping of their SANs.
MsgWay-WG                      <11>                            RRP-Msgs 


In L2 operation under levels C and D, when a source node, S, needs to
send a message to a destination node, D, it asks first any of the HRs on
its SAN for a source route (SR) to D.  That HR would (1) provide such an
SR, or (2) reply with an "Redirect" message, suggesting to ask another
HR on the same SAN, or (3) report no knowledge of D.

S may ask more than one HR for the SR to the same D and choose to use
the best of these SRs.

In L3 operation, when a source node, S, needs to send a message to a
destination node, D, it sends that message to any of the HRs on its SAN,
using L2, asking for L3-forwarding to D, using D's MessageWay-address.
That HR would (1) forward it toward D, or (2) forward it toward D and
return a "Redirect" message, suggesting to use, in the future, another
HR on the same SAN for that destination, or (3) report no knowledge of D.

Under levels C and D, nodes may be located by MessageWay-addresses,
names, or capabilities.


NODE ATTRIBUTES
---------------

* Each node has: Address, Name, Capabilities, Logical-Addresses

  Address:           16 bits, flat, unique in this MessageWay, 

  Name:              flat globally unique (e.g., IP address),
                     arbitrary length

  Capabilities:      "regular node", router, MessageWay-server, NFS,
                     paging server, M/C server, DSP, printer, ....)

                     Some capabilities may need additional parameters
                     (e.g., SAN-ID for routers, and resolution+colors
                     for printers).

		     The capabilities are defined in the Enumeration
		     Appendix (A5).

  Logical-Addresses: a set of (logical) addresses to which this node
                     requests to listen.  Logical addresses designate
                     multicast and broadcast groups.

                     The control of the Logical-Addresses (a la IGCP)
                     is not defined in this document.

		     The management of logical addresses (e.g., JOIN
		     and LEAVE) is not defined yet.

ROUTING TABLES (RTs)
--------------------

Routing tables provide the information needed for finding SRs to
destinations specified by their addresses.  In Level-D they also
provide means to identify nodes also by names and/or capabilities.

The RTs are based on "maps" for SANs prepared by local nodes on the
SANs.  The inter-SAN routing process depends on the exchange of these
maps to form local and remote RTs.
MsgWay-WG                      <13>                            RRP-Msgs 


The attributes of an RT are:

        CSR             Common Source Route for the entire RT
        MinMTU          Min MTU for this RT (along the above CSR)
        RCVF            List of addresses or SAN-IDs (history of this RT)
        SN              Serial Number of this RT
        SAN-ID          of the SAN which this RT describes
        Local-RT        Node-Structures, for nodes on that SAN

The Local-RT has one or more Node-Structures for each node on this SAN.
These Node-Structures are of the form:

                Address                         (on this SAN)
                Logical-Addresses               (to which it listens)
                [Name]                          (optional)
                [Capabilities]                  (optional)
                SR from the mapper to that node

Each SR entry (and the CSR, too) contains Q, the quality of the SR, an
unsigned 16-bit integer.  The units are not defined here.  It is assumed
that Q is monotonic (sort of analogous to latency, hence additive) with
all-0 being the best and all-1 the worst.

The CSR has an MTU associated with it that reflects also the MTU at that
SAN.  Hence, there is no need to associate MTUs with the SR of each node.

The RCVF is the list of the addresses along which this RT was forwarded.
Its entries are either HR-addresses or SAN-IDs.

The RCVF could have been derived from the CSR, if only the HRs could
parse the CSR and associate HR-addresses with SRs and SAN-IDs with
HR-addresses, which should not be assumed.

The SN is associated with the RCVF list.

MinMTU is the minimal MTU which is valid throughout the CSR and the
mapped SAN.

The Node-Structure have SRs from the mapper to each node.  The CSR is a
SR to the same mapper.  Hence, by catenating the CSR to the beginning of
the SR in the Node-Structure, a SR is derived all the way to that node.

Each SAN has a unique SAN-ID, known to the HRs on it.  The SAN-ID is
a 16 bit entity, between 0x0040 and 0x7FFD, just as node addresses.

INTER-SAN MAPPING (Level-D)
---------------------------

"Buddy-HRs" are HRs that are nodes on the same SAN.  The halves of the
same routers are called "twin-HRs" or "neighbors".

HRs use the following procedure to exchange RTs, from which they derive
routes to any node in the MessageWay.  Each HR interchanges RTs only
with his buddy-HRs (over their common SAN), and with its "twin-HR".
Typically, RTs arrived from the twin are forwarded to all the buddies,
and RT arrived from any buddy are forwarded to the twin.

This document does NOT define how HRs map their own SANs and how they
find their buddies.  It is the job of each SAN to provide this
information.

The procedure starts with each HR getting an RT for its own SAN.
Thereafter, whenever a new RT (including the local-RT) is received from
anywhere (or changes) it is processed by:

        if (I am in the RCVF)     {ignore this RT} ;
        if (SN-of-RT =< SN[RCVF]) {ignore this RT} ;
        Keep this RT with:
                CSR      = ( (me->Sender-of-RT), CSR )
                Q        = Q + q(me->Sender-of-RT)
                RCVF     = (me, RCVF)
                SN       = SN[RCVF]++
                MinMTU   = Min(my-MTU, MinMTU)
                SAN-ID   = (as received in RT)
                Local-RT = (as received in RT)

        if (The RT received from my twin-HR) {Send RT to all my buddy-HRs}
	 else /* if received from a buddy */ {Send RT only to my twin-HR}

COMMENTS:

The MTU of the new RT is the minimum of its previous MTU and that of the
current SAN.

HRs may keep only the k best XRTs to any given SAN.

SNs should be associated with the entire RCVF.  An RT with a higher SN
should always replace an RT with a lower SN and the same RCVF.

An HR finds an SR (L2-route) from itself to the foreign node-D, by
finding an RT that has D in it, catenating the CSR of that RT in front
of the SR for D, as found in the RT.  The HR also should add their Qs to
get the total Q.

The best SR is found by repeating this action and looking for the route
with the least Q.
MsgWay-WG                      <15>				RRP-Msgs 


For L3-forwarding, the HR finds an RT that has D in it, and L2-forwards
the packet to the first address on the RCVF of that RT.

When an HR receives a HR-DOWN (or a LINK-DOWN) error message, it finds
all the RTs that it has with that HR (or link) in their RCVF fields,
then it relays the error message "up and down", and deletes these RTs.
"Up and down" means to those from which these RT were received, and to
those to which these RTs were sent.

RRP RECORD FORMAT
-----------------

All RRP-records start with an 8 byte header as shown below.  Its first
byte identifies the record type (RTyp).  The second byte is the Pad-Count
byte (PL) indicating the number of padding bytes.  The third and the
fourth bytes (RL) are the length (in 8B-words) of the record, including
the record header, hence it is always greater than zero.  The rest of
the header bytes depend on the record type.

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  RTyp  |   PL   |       RL        |        |        |        |        |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Some records that have an arbitrary length are "right justified" and
have PL padding bytes before the data.  Padding Before Data [PBD].    

Some records that have an arbitrary length are "left justified" and
have PL bytes after the data.  Padding After Data [PAD].

In either case the total number of data bytes is: (8*RL-PL-4).

In the following xxx indicate bytes that are discarded.

===> [R5] Source-Route Record [PBD], with Q for that route.
          (e.g., a  combined SR with 14 bytes and a SR with 6 bytes)

This record carries one, or more, L2RHs.

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Q (the Route Quality) is an unsigned 16-bit integer.  The units are not
defined here.  It is assumed that it is monotonic with all-0 being the
best and all-1 the worst.  If there is a R6 (MTU) for that SR (as shown
in the example above), it should be included inside the record, such
that the RL of this R5 should include also the RL of the MTU record (R6).


===> [R6] MTU record [PBD]:

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

The MTU record provides the MTU for the SR defined before (by an R5).

The value of 0 means indefinite MTU (i.e., any length is OK).

(A1) MessageWay Packet Types

The EEP header reserves 6 bytes for signaling from the source node
directly to the destination node.  They are the PACKET TYPE (PT),
TYPE EXTENSION (TE), and FREE (F), 2 bytes each.

This list defines values for the TYPE field.  Each message-type has
its own interpretation of the PT and the F fields.

	       Appendix-B: Example of the Mapping Process
	       ------------------------------------------

First, the notation.  Rab is the A-half of the router between the SANs
A and B.  It has a MessageWay-address on SAN-A.  It is interconnected
via some link with Rba, its twin, the HR that is on SAN-B, having a
MessageWay-address on SAN-B.

Hence the router between SAN-A and SAN-B is: Rab+Rba+interconnection. 

If there are several routers between A and B, numbers are appended to
their designations (e.g., Rab2).

The following map is used throughout the examples below:

                #21     #22
                Rab     Rba
     +-----------+  (ab) +-------------+

           *        *          *   *
       (ac)*     (ad)*    (bd1)*   *(bd2)
           *          *        *   *
        #24*        #26*    #28*   *#30
        Rca*         Rda*  Rdb1*   *Rdb2
     +-----*-----+       *-----*---*---+        +----------+
     |H4,H5 [C]  ********* [D]    H6,H7********** [E] H8,H9|
     +-----------+ (cd)  +-------------+  (de)  +----------+
                Rcd     Rdc           Rde      Red
                #31     #32           #33      #34

Rab is the a-interface for a router between SAN-A and SAN-B.
Each interface has its own address, marked with #nn.

(ab) is a shorthand notation for Rab+Rba, interconnected via
an inter-SAN connection, marked here by ***.

Hn (for n=1,2,3,...) is node #n, its address is also #n.

The Local-RT for SAN-A, as computed at Rax is denoted by LRT(A/ax).

Initially, Rab has an LRT(A/ab) consisting of:

    H0  #00  node   (SR(A:Rab->H0),  Q)
    H1  #01  node   (SR(A:Rab->H1),  Q)
    Rac #23  router (SR(A:Rab->Rac), Q)
    Rad #25  router (SR(A:Rab->Rad), Q)
Appendix-B                      <32>                            MsgWay-WG


Rac has an LRT(A/ac) consisting of:

    H0  #00  node   (SR(A:Rac->H0),  Q)
    H1  #01  node   (SR(A:Rac->H1),  Q)
    Rab #21  router (SR(A:Rac->Rab), Q)
    Rad #25  router (SR(A:Rac->Rad), Q)

Rad has an LRT(A/ad) consisting of:

    H0  #00  node   (SR(A:Rad->H0),  Q)
    H1  #01  node   (SR(A:Rad->H1),  Q)
    Rab #21  router (SR(A:Rad->Rab), Q)
    Rac #23  router (SR(A:Rad->Rac), Q)

Rba has an LRT(B/ba) consisting of:

    H2   #02 node   (SR(B:Rba->H2),  Q)
    H3   #03 node   (SR(B:Rba->H3),  Q)
    Rbd1 #27 router (SR(B:Rba->Rbd1),Q)
    Rbd2 #29 router (SR(B:Rba->Rbd2),Q)

Other HRs have similar LRTs.

Later, each HR exchanges (over "***"-its interconnection) its RTs with
its "other-half".

In the following examples the SN and the Q entries are not shown.

Rab now has:
  LRT(A/ab)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rab->Rba), LRT(B/ba), RCVF={ba} }

Rba has:
  LRT(B/ba)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rba->Rab), LRT(A/ab), RCVF={ab} }

Similarly Rac has:
  LRT(A/ac)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rac->Rca), LRT(C/ca), RCVF={ca} }

Rca has
  LRT(C/ca)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rca->Rac), LRT(A/ac), RCVF={ac} }

Rda has
  LRT(D/da)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rda->Rad), LRT(A/ad), RCVF={ad} }

Because Rab, Rac, Rad and are directly connected (because they are on A),
they exchange their XRTs.
MsgWay-WG                      <33>                            Appendix-B


Now Rab has:      
  LRT(A/ab)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rab->Rba),               LRT(B/ba), RCVF={ba}      }
  XRT{ CSR=(A:Rab->Rac,*:Rac->Rca),    LRT(C/ca), RCVF={ac,ca}   }
  XRT{ CSR=(A:Rab->Rad,*:Rad->Rda),    LRT(D/da), RCVF={ad,da}   }

Rba has:
  LRT(B/ba)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rba->Rab),               LRT(A/ab), RCVF={ab}      }
  XRT{ CSR=(B:Rba->Rbd1,*:Rbd1->Rdb1), LRT(D/db1),RCVF={bd1,db1} }
  XRT{ CSR=(B:Rba->Rbd2,*:Rbd2->Rdb2), LRT(D/db2),RCVF={bd2,db2} }

Next, Rba will share it with Rab.  Now Rab has:
  LRT(A/ab)
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rab->Rba),                          LRT(B/ba), RCVF={ba}    }
  XRT{ CSR=(A:Rab->Rac,*:Rac->Rca),               LRT(C/ca), RCVF={ac,ca} }
  XRT{ CSR=(A:Rab->Rad,*:Rad->Rda),               LRT(D/da), RCVF={ad,da} }
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rab->Rba,B:Rba->Rbd1,*:Rbd1->Rdb1), LRT(D/db1),RCVF={ba,bd1,db1}}
  XRT{ CSR=(*:Rab->Rba,B:Rba->Rbd2,*:Rbd2->Rdb2), LRT(D/db2),RCVF={ba,bd2,db2}}


Now Rab has 3 different ways to get to nodes on D: directly through
Rad, or via Rab to B, and then via either Rbd1 or Rbd2 into D.  The Qs
could provide preference.

Rab may decide to keep all of them, or only the best (or the k best ones).

Soon, Rab will also have yet another way to get to D:

  XRT{ CSR=(A:Rab->Rac,*:Rac->Rca,C:Rca->Rcd,*:Rcd->Rdc),
       LRT(D/dc),
       RCVF={ac,ca,cd,dc}
     }

Let / represent a path between 2 buddy-HRs on the same SAN (e.g., ax/ay
over the SAN a).  Let \ represent a path between twing HRs (e.g., ab\ba).

However, with time Rab will have the following paths to SAN-E:

        ab/ad\da/de \ed                              (ADE)
           ab\ba/bd1\db1/de\ed                       (AB1DE)
           ab\ba/bd2\db2/de\ed                       (AB2DE)
        ab/ac\ca/cd \dc /de\ed                       (ACDE)

and also:

        ab/ad\da/db1\bd1/bd2\db2/de \ed               (AD1B2DE)
        ab/ad\da/db2\bd2/bd1\db1/de \ed               (AD2B1DE)
        ab/ac\ca/cd \dc /db1\bd1/bd2\db2/de\ed         (ACD1B2DE)
        ab/ac\ca/cd \dc /db2\bd2/bd1\db1/de\ed         (ACD2B1DE)
           ab\ba/bd1\db1/dc \cd /ca \ac /ad\da/de\ed        (AB1DCADE)
           ab\ba/bd2\db2/dc \cd /ca \ac /ad\da/de\ed        (AB2DCADE)
           ab\ba/bd1\db1/da \ad /ac \ca /cd\dc/de\ed        (AB1DACDE)
           ab\ba/bd2\db2/da \ad /ac \ca /cd\dc/de\ed        (AB2DACDE)
Appendix-B                      <34>                            MsgWay-WG


The first path is the most reasonable, the next three are also
reasonable, but the last eight are not reasonable.  None of these paths
has the same HR twice, but the latter eight have the same SAN (D, here)
twice.

The latter eight (eleven?) should be ignored because of high Q values.
All the latter eight have D twice in their SAN-RCVF.

	 Appendix-C: Example of the use of RRP (using Myrinets)
	 ------------------------------------------------------

In this example Node1 on SAN1 (with MTU=16KB) is looking for a DSP
that can accommodate IEEE floating-point 64-bit data.  (1) It uses
L3-forwarding to ask its default router (RouterA) to provide the list
of floating-point DSPs that can handle 64bit IEEE data.  (2) RouterA
provides the addresses of both Node2 and Node3.  For its own reasons
Node1 decided to use Node2.  (3) Node1 asks RouterA which router
to use for Node2.  (4) RouterA suggests to use RouterB.  (5) Node1
uses L3-forwarding to verify Node2's capabilities, by asking Node2
for information about itself.  (6) Node2 provides this information
which Node1 likes.  (7) Node1 asks RouterB for L2RH(s) for Node2.
(8) RouterB provides the requested L2RH(s) with their MTU of 8KB.
Finally, (9) Node1 starts sending data to Node2 using L2-forwarding.

If Node1 had only Level-A implementation then it would have the combined
L2RH from itself to RouterB and from there to Node2 pre-wired, saving
all this message exchange.

The sequence of messages is:

(1) Node1 uses L3-forwarding to ask its default router (RouterA) to
provide a list of floating-point DSPs that can handle 64bit IEEE data.
Node1 knows about RouterA on its network, with SR={2,MW}={2,3,0},
where MSGWAY=0x0300 is the 16-bit Myrinet-type assigned to MessageWay.
Node1 uses L3-forwarding to send an RRP#4 message asking RouterA (via
the interface RTRA1) for the source route to Node2:

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

This asks for information about nodes with capability #7 (IEEE

both Node2 and Node3.

For its own reasons Node1 decided to use Node2.

(3) Node1 uses RRP#6 to ask RouterA which HR to use for node2.

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

(4) RouterA uses RRP#3 to redirect to node3 via RouterB.

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

(5) Node1 uses RRP#4 (still using L3-forwarding via RouterB) to verify
Node2's capabilities, by asking Node2 for information about itself.

(6) Node2 uses RRP#5 (also using L3-forwarding via RouterB) to provide
more information to Node1 about Node2 than what RouterA did (e.g., the name).

(7) Node1 uses RRP#1 to ask RouterB for L2RH(s) for Node2.

(8) RouterB uses RRP#2 to provide Node1 with an L2RH for Node2, with
its Q and MTU.  Here it is {3,0,MW} from RouterB to Node2.

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

The MTU in the R6 above is the lessor of the MTUs of both networks.

(9) Finally, Node1 starts sending data to Node2 using L2-forwarding.

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| SR-Len=4 (bytes)|   3    |   0    |   3    |   0    |  xxx   |  xxx   |L2RH
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|      Node2      |Priority| Ver=5  |     "sensor"    |     SubType     |MH
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|E=3|PL=0|   Length=?  (in 8B-words)|      Node1      |     Free=0      |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|                                                                       |Data
| <------------------- The sensor data goes here ---------------------> |Data

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|      64 zero bits, unless any error was indicated along the path      |MWtail
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

E=3 (0011) indicates that all the data is Little Endian 64-bit. 


Again, if Node1 had only Level-A implementation then it would have the
combined L2RH from itself to RouterB and from there to Node2 pre-wired,
saving all this message exchange.
