1.  Introduction

   As written, RFC 6838 [RFC6838] permits the registration of media type
   subtype names which contain any number of occurrences of the "+"
   character.  RFC 6838 defines the characters following the final "+"
   to be a structured syntax suffix, but does not define anything
   further about how to interpret subtype names containing more than one
   "+" character.

   This document updates RFC 6838 to clarify how to interpret subtype
   names containing more than one "+" character as subtypes with
   multiple suffixes.

   As registration of media types which use a structured suffix has
   become widely supported, this enables further specialization of media
   types that build on already registered and well-defined media types
   which themselves use a structured suffix.

1.1.  Media Types with Multiple Suffixes

   The following paragraphs are additions to RFC 6838.

   Media types MAY be registered with more than one suffix appended to
   the base subtype name.  The suffixes MUST be interpreted as ordered,
   starting with the most specific (the base subtype name) on the left,
   to the most generic on the right.  Characters before the first "+" in
   a subtype name specify the base subtype name.  Characters following
   each subsequent "+" in a subtype name denote additional syntax
   specifier suffixes.

   This means that receivers of the media type can do generic processing
   on the underlying representation according to their ability to
   process any subset of the right-most suffix(es) in cases where
   specific handling of the exact media type is not required.

   Media types with more than one suffix MUST be registered according to
   the procedure defined in [RFC6838] with the additional requirement
   that each subset of suffixes, starting from the right-most suffix,
   MUST be individually registered as a subtype in its own right.

   For example, a media type that uses the two suffixes "+svg+xml" is
   only permitted insofar as "svg+xml" is already registered.
