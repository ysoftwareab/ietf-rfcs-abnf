   as a wireless LAN access point) is separated from the authentication
   server.  However, EAP itself does not have a concept of a service

   a backward compatible extension to popular EAP methods for
   authenticating service related information, such as the identity and

Internet-Draft    Authenticated Service Information for EAP October 2004


1.  Introduction

   EAP is usually used in an arrangement where the actual service (such
   as a wireless LAN access point) is separated from the authentication
   server.  However, EAP itself does not have a concept of a service
   identity or its parameters, and thus the client usually does not
   authenticate any information about the service itself, even when a
   mutually authenticating EAP method is used.

   However, a method that supports channel bindings [4] makes it
   possible to ensure that the client, the node providing the service,
   and the authentication server all have the same information about
   this information.  This does not, by itself, ensure that the
   information is correct, just that everyone has the same information;
   a service node might be providing a service that this particular node
   should not be providing.  A method that supports authenticated
   service information ensures in addition that the authentication
   server knows this information to be correct.

   This document specifies a backwards compatible extension to popular
   EAP methods for supporting both channel bindings and authenticated
   service information.  A common parameter name space is created in
   order to ensure that the same kinds of information can be
   authenticated independent of the choice of the EAP method.

   This extension is intended for the verification of service
   information.  It is not intended as a means for communicating
   information about parameters that EAP clients would not otherwise be
   aware of based on their communication with the node providing the
   service.

   This rest of the document is organized as follows.  Section 3 gives
   an overview of the protocol operation.  Section 4 describes the kind
   of information that can be verified.  We have provided only an
   initial list of parameters for IEEE 802.11 and IKEv2, but additional
   parameters can be defined through IANA.  Section 5 describes the
   extensions necessary for certain popular EAP methods.  Support for
   other EAP methods can be added in other specifications.

2.  Authenticated Service Information

   EAP is run for the purposes of providing granting access to a
   service, such as network access.  The nodes providing such services
   (called authenticators in EAP) typically have an identifier or
   identifiers, and offer a specific type of a service with an
   associated set of parameters.  Collectively, this identifier, type
   and parameter information is called service information.

Internet-Draft    Authenticated Service Information for EAP October 2004


   In the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework, different
   authentication methods can provide varying security properties.  One
   such property is called "channel bindings", which is described in RFC
   3748 [4] as follows:

      "The communication within an EAP method of integrity-protected
      channel properties such as endpoint identifiers which can be
      compared to values communicated via out of band mechanisms (such
      as via a AAA or lower layer protocol)."

   The document continues by describing the security implications of not
   being able to verify service information:

      "It is possible for a compromised or poorly implemented EAP
      authenticator to communicate incorrect information to the EAP peer
      and/or server.  This may enable an authenticator to impersonate
      another authenticator or communicate incorrect information via
      out-of-band mechanisms (such as via a AAA or lower layer
      protocol).

      Where EAP is used in pass-through mode, the EAP peer typically
      does not verify the identity of the pass-through authenticator, it
      only verifies that the pass-through authenticator is trusted by
      the EAP server.  This creates a potential security vulnerability.

      Section 4.3.7 of [11] describes how an EAP pass-through
      authenticator acting as a AAA client can be detected if it
      attempts to impersonate another authenticator (such by sending
      incorrect NAS-Identifier [9], NAS-IP-Address [9] or
      NAS-IPv6-Address [10] attributes via the AAA protocol).  However,
      it is possible for a pass-through authenticator acting as a AAA
      client to provide correct information to the AAA server while
      communicating misleading information to the EAP peer via a lower
      layer protocol.

      For example, it is possible for a compromised authenticator to
      utilize another authenticator's Called-Station-Id or
      NAS-Identifier in communicating with the EAP peer via a lower
      layer protocol, or for a pass-through authenticator acting as a
      AAA client to provide an incorrect peer Calling-Station-Id [9, 12]
      to the AAA server via the AAA protocol.

      In order to address this vulnerability, EAP methods may support a
      protected exchange of channel properties such as endpoint
      identifiers, including (but not limited to): Called-Station-Id
      [9, 12], Calling-Station-Id [9, 12], NAS-Identifier [9],
      NAS-IP-Address [9], and NAS-IPv6-Address [10].

      Using such a protected exchange, it is possible to match the
      channel properties provided by the authenticator via out-of-band
      mechanisms against those exchanged within the EAP method.  Where
      discrepancies are found, these SHOULD be logged; additional
      actions MAY also be taken, such as denying access."

   Unfortunately, such verification is currently not possible in popular
   network scenarios.  For instance, in IEEE 802.11 networks a rogue
   operator can actually advertise the same identity (BSSID or SSID) as
   the local operator; the parameters advertised by the access point
   information are not authenticated end-to-end to the home network.
   There is no support is in the commonly used EAP methods for
   authentication of service information, and there are no alternative
   verification means in the IEEE 802 lower layer.  For instance, rogue
   access points can present a different identity to the client and to
   the home network.  Or a rogue IKEv2 gateway can claim to be a 802.11
   access point to its clients, but still appear as an IKEv2 gateway
   towards the authentication server.

   There are cases where the lower layer does provide its own means of
   authenticating the service information.  For instance, in IKE2, EAP
   is used together with certificate-based authentication of the
   responder.  However, this document may be useful with proposed IKEv2
   extensions like [14] that remove the need to deploy a PKI.

   This situation is further complicated by the fact that services do
   not necessarily have just a single identifier, but several different
   identifiers of different types.  For instance, an IEEE 802.11 access
   point could be identified by a BSSID, an IPv4 address (e.g.,
   NAS-IP-Address), or a domain name (e.g., NAS-Identifier).  Other
   identifiers, such as SSID, do not necessarily identify a single
   access point, but may be more interesting to the client (if you
   consider the "service" to be wireless LAN network access in some
   hotspot, rather than a single physical box).

   It is important to make a distinction between channel bindings and
   authenticating information related to the the pass-through
   authenticator.  Channel bindings only ensure that the same
   information is available to the EAP peer and the AAA server.  This
   alone does not prevent an authenticator from impersonating another
   authenticator if the AAA server blindly accepts any information
   received from the authenticator.  To provide authentication, the AAA
   server has to verify that the information actually corresponds to the
   entity the AAA-Key is sent to.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The basic idea in this extension is that the AAA server sends the EAP

   peer a statement that it has sent (or is going to send) the AAA-Key
   (usually the MSK) to an access device associated with particular set
   of identifiers and other information.

   In order to protect this statement, an EAP method needs to be able to
   pass data from the EAP server to the EAP peer, and be able to protect
   this exchange using keys known only them and not the access device.
   The Transient EAP Keys (TEKs) can be used for this purpose, as these
   keys are only known to the EAP endpoints and not communicated to the
   access device.

   After receiving this information, the EAP peer can compare the
   information provided from the EAP server to the information it has
   received directly from the access device.  If the information does
   not match, the access device has provided different information to
   the peer and to the AAA protocol.  This is disallowed, and the
   authentication SHOULD be terminated in this case.

   In order to provide a generic solution where any EAP method can be
   used on a given lower layer, the same format is used for the
   exchanged information.  This format consists of Tag-Length-Value
   triplets with IANA managed tag space.

   The parameter information is sent along the other messages in an EAP
   method.  When mismatching information is received from EAP and
   authenticator, authentication MUST be terminated.  The exact message
   sequences depend on the used EAP method, but Figure 1 shows a typical
   sequence.

     .                                                               .

     .                                                               .

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The meaning of the fields is described as follows:

   A

      The authenticated information flag.  Value of zero means that the
      information is claimed by the service, but the EAP server is
      unable to tell whether the information is correct or not (i.e.,
      this corresponds to channel bindings without authentication).
      Value of one means that the EAP server knows that the service is
      authorized to claim this ("authenticated service information").

   Res

      A 3-bit field reserved for future use.  The value MUST be
      initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

Internet-Draft    Authenticated Service Information for EAP October 2004


   Parameter Identifier

      A 16-bit field that specifies what parameter is being
      communicated.

   Length

      A 12-bit field that indicates the length of the Value field, in
      bytes.

   Value

      The actual parameter value.  The interpretation of this value
      depends on the Parameter Identifier field.

   The encapsulation of this sequence of parameters is EAP method
   dependent.

4.2  General Parameters

   These parameters are for any type of nodes and lower layers.  The
   Service Type parameter MUST be supported by all nodes conforming to
   this specification, and MUST be the first parameter in all messages
   containing a sequence of parameters defined here.

4.2.1  Service Type Parameter

   The Parameter Identifier for this parameter is 0, and the Value is a
   32-bit integer, represented in network byte order.  The following
   values have been currently defined:

      0  IEEE 802.11

      1  IKEv2

   The 'A' flag MUST always be set with the Service Type parameter.  The
   receiver SHOULD fail the authentication if the Value field is either
   not recognized by it or is not the same one for which it thinks
   access is being provided.

4.2.2  Service Provider Parameter

   The Parameter Identifier for this parameter is 1, and the Value is an
   UTF-8 encoded string describing the human readable name of the
   service provider.  As EAP is used primarily for network access, this
   is typically the name of the access network provider.

Internet-Draft    Authenticated Service Information for EAP October 2004


4.2.3  Country Code Parameter

   The Parameter Identifier for this parameter is 2, and the Value is an
   ASCII string of at most 3 characters, conforming to the ISO 3166 [8]
   country code.

4.3  Parameters for IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs

   All the following parameters MUST be supported when IEEE 802.11 is
   accepted as a Service Type.

4.3.1  SSID Parameter

   The Parameter Identifier for this parameter is 3, and the Value is an
   octet string containing the Service Set Identifier (SSID).

4.3.2  BSSID Parameter

   The Parameter Identifier for this parameter is 4, and the Value is a
   6-octet string containing the BSSID.

4.4  Parameters for IKEv2

   All the following parameters MUST be supported when IKEv2 is accepted
   as the Service Type.

4.4.1  Responder Address Parameter

   The Parameter Identifier for this parameter is 14, and the Value is
   the IP address of the node who acted as the responder for this IKEv2
   EAP exchange.  The Value is either 4 or 16 bytes depending on whether
   IPv4 or IPv6 is used.

4.4.2  IDr Parameter

   The Parameter Identifier for this parameter is 16, and the Value is
   an octet string containing the IKEv2 initiator identity payload
   (IDr).

5.  EAP Method Extensions

   This section describes an initial set of extensions to some current
   EAP methods so that they can be transport the parameter information.

   The extensions are optional and backwards compatible, so that, where
   allowed by policy, EAP peers without these extensions can still
   contact EAP servers with these extensions and vice versa.  The
   default policy SHOULD be that such usage is allowed.

5.1  EAP-TLS

   A TLS extension [3] is added to the EAP TLS [2]
   client_hello/server_hello messages.  The extension type of the
   extension is EAP Service Information and it has the number < To Be
   Assigned By IANA >.  The extension contains a sequence of parameters,
   followed by each other.

   The extension sent in the client_hello message SHOULD contain zero
   parameters, and is only used for capability detection.  As discussed
   in RFC 3546, when these extensions appear in a client hello message,
   they are ignored by old server implementations.  The lack of this
   extension in the authenticator's server hello response SHOULD be
   taken as an indication that the authenticator does not support the
   mechanisms defined in this document.  The authenticator MUST NOT use
   this extension unless the client provided the same extension in its
   own hello message, as per RFC 3546 the client is required to
   terminate the TLS session otherwise.

   The client_hello/server_hello messages are included in MACs in the
   TLS Finished messages, which ensures that modifications will be
   detected.

   The following sequence illustrates the operation of the EAP TLS
   protocol with this extension:

   This works the same way when resuming session.  Note that the
   parameters can change from the initial authentication.

5.2  PEAPv2

   In PEAPv2 [7], the Connection-Binding TLV is used to carry parameter
   objects.  One Connection-Binding TLV for this purpose is exchanged in
   each direction, containing all the parameters that need to be
   exchanged.  The Connection-Binding TLV carries a set of PEAPv2 TLVs.
   The transport of parameters for the purposes of this document takes
   place through the PEAPv2 Service Information Parameter TLV defined in
   the following:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Note that the AT_SERVICEID attribute is used also in the
   EAP-Request/AKA/AKA-Reauthentication message, and that the set of
   parameters exchanged in this case may differ from those agreed upon
   earlier in the initial authentication.

   The use of the AT_SERVICEID attribute is backward compatible, because
   existing implementations ignore unknown parameters.

5.4  EAP-SIM

   For EAP-SIM, a new attribute AT_SERVICEID is added to the
   EAP-Request/SIM/Challenge message.  The format of the AT_SERVICEID
   attribute is as shown for EAP-AKA.

   The following sequence illustrates the operation of the EAP-SIM
   protocol with this extension:

   As with EAP-AKA, the AT_SERVICEID attribute must be passed also in
   the EAP-Request/SIM/SIM-Reauthentication message.

6.  Security Considerations

   The implications of being unable to verify service information have
   been described in Section 7.15 of RFC 3748 [4].  These include
   vulnerabilities related to compromised access points or fraudulent
   service providers.  When properly used, the mechanism provided in
   this document removes these vulnerabilities.  The mechanism is



Arkko & Eronen           Expires April 25, 2005                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    Authenticated Service Information for EAP October 2004


   generic and not tied to any specific EAP method or use of EAP over a
   specific link layer, and as such can be expected to be more easily
   deployed as alternative suggestions such as those described in PEAPv2
   [7] or EAP FAST [13].

   Authenticating the service information may complicate operation in
   some deployment scenarios, since it requires that the AAA server is
   able to authenticate the expected kinds of information.  For
   instance, RADIUS is often deployed in situations where the only
   authenticated information related to the RADIUS client is the IP
   address; other information may be present in the Access-Request
   message (such as BSSID/SSID in the Called-Station-Id attribute), but
   this is simply claimed information not authenticated information.
   Where such information is not available, vulnerabilities still
   remain.

   In the deployment phase, it is possible that clients and servers do
   not get support for the mechanism described in this document at the
   same time.  It is a policy decision to accept an EAP exchange from a
   party that does not support this mechanism.  This decision is
   protected from a bidding down attack by a man-in-the-middle, because
   EAP methods have integrity protection for the exchanged messages.
   Therefore, the removal or modification of the parameter block would
   be detected.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1  Allocations Requested in This Document

   This document requests an IANA allocation of TLS Extension type [3]
   for EAP Service Identity (see Section 5.1).

   This document requests an IANA allocation of a PEAPv2 [7] TLV type
   number for the Service Identity Parameter TLV (see Section 5.2).

   This document requests an IANA allocation for the attribute type
   number AT_SERVICEID in the [6] and [5] protocols (see Section 5.3 and
   Section 5.4).  The same value should be allocated for both protocols.

7.2  Future Allocation Policy

   New Parameter Identifier values can be defined through Specification
   Required [1].  The following values have been currently allocated:

      0  Service Type

Internet-Draft    Authenticated Service Information for EAP October 2004


      1  Service Provider

      2  Country Code

      3  802.11/SSID

      4  802.11/BSSID

      6  IKEv2/Responder Address

      7  IKEv2/IDr

   New Service Type values can be defined through IETF Consensus [1].
   The following values have been currently allocated:

      0  IEEE 802.11

      1  IKEv2

   Values in other enumerated parameters can be defined through First
   Come, First Served [1].  However, this extension is intended only for
   the verification of service information.  Its use for communicating
   other information not already known by the EAP client (such as for
   service discovery) is discouraged.
