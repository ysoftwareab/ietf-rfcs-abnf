1.  Introduction

   When a User is authorized to use a service via Diameter applications
   such as [RFC4006] or [RFC7155], the Client is not aware of the
   average load placed upon it by User.  This can lead to overload
   situations or the Diameter Client redirecting or denying services to
   valid Users even though their presence may overload the service.

   Given virtualization and the use of many software based services the
   service capacity varies on a service instance, i.e. Diameter Client,
   basis.

   This specification introduces the Predicted-Service-Units Attribute
   Value Pair (AVP).  This information conveys the predicted usage
   introduced on the service by the authorized User.  Such information
   can be used by the Diameter Client to estimate future load and
   proactively manage its resources.

   Although this informaiton is conveyed from the Diameter Server to the
   Client several system aspects are out of the scope of this document:

   o  How the Diameter Server acquired the information contained in the
      Predicted-Service-UnitsAVP.

   o  How the values in the Predicted-Service-Units AVP were determined.

   o  The accuracy or validity of the values in the Predicted-Service-
      Units AVP.

   o  Specific actions the Diameter Client should take when its service
      functions are overloaded.

   o  Specific actions the Diameter Client takes to bring itself in/out
      of service for new or existing Users.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "OPTIONAL", "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Predicted Service AVPs

3.1.  Predicted-Service-Units

   The Predicted-Service-Units AVP (AVP Code TBD1) is of type Grouped
   and contains the amount of units that the Diameter credit-control
   client can expect to provide to the end user until the service must
   be released or the new Credit-Control-Request must be sent, if a
   Granted-Service-Unit AVP [RFC4006] has been applied to the user's
   service.  A client is not required to implement all of the unit
   types, and it must ingore unknown or unsupported unit types.

   The Predicted-Service-Units AVP is defined as follows (per the
   grouped- avp-def of [RFC6733]):

            Predicted-Service-Units ::= < AVP Header: TBD1 >
                                       [ CC-Time ]
                                       [ CC-Money ]
                                       [ CC-Total-Octets ]
                                       [ CC-Input-Octets ]
                                       [ CC-Output-Octets ]
                                       [ CC-Service-Specific-Units ]
                                      *[ Service-Cost-Information ]
                                      *[ AVP ]

Internet-Draft          Diameter Predicted Units               July 2016


   With the exception of the Service-Cost-Information AVP, all AVPs are
   defined in [RFC4006].

   The presence of this information is provided as anticipated load
   information to the Diameter Client and is not intended to be
   prescriptive in any manner regarding the user's service.

3.2.  Service-Cost-Information

   The Service-Cost-Information AVP (AVP Code TBD2) is of type Grouped,
   and it is used to return the service cost information, which the
   client can use, if it understands it, for various purposes inclduing
   load prediction and sizing.

   A client is not required to implement all of the unit types, and it
   must ingore unknown or unsupported unit types.

   It is defined as follows (per the grouped-avp-def of [RFC6733]):

             Service-Cost-Information ::= < AVP Header: TBD2 >
                                        { Unit-Value }
                                        { Cost-Unit }
                                        { Service-Dimension }


   Unit-Value and Cost-Unit are defined in [RFC4006].

3.3.  Service-Dimension

   The Service-Dimension AVP (AVP Code TBD3) is of type UTF8String.  It
   specifies the applicable service type (dimension) to the Service-
   Cost-Information.

4.  Usage Examples

   When Predicted-Service-Units are returned as part of an authorization
   per [RFC7155] or [RFC4006], the client MAY use this information as
   guidance on projected load the new user will generate on the service.

   If the client supports/understnds the information provided in the
   Predicted-Service-Units AVP, it can update it's projected load.
   Based upon this information it MAY take one or more of the following
   actions (this is not exhaustive):

   o  Redirect at the service / protocol level any new service requests.

   o  Begin enforcing mechanisms to reduce the amount of service load on
      a subset of services already established.

   o  Remove itself from any system that directs new service requests to
      it.

   o  Initiate administrative functions to increase its capacity or
      start the process of creating new intances to service requests.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA allocated AVP codes in the IANA-controlled namespace registry
   specified in Section 11.1.1 of [RFC6733] for the following AVPs that
   are defined in this document.

   +--------------------------+---------+-----------------+------------+
   | AVP                      | AVP     | Section Defined | Data Type  |
   |                          | Code    |                 |            |
   +--------------------------+---------+-----------------+------------+
   | Predicted-Service-Units  | TBD1    | Section 3.1     | GROUPED    |
   | Service-Cost-Information | TBD2    | Section 3.2     | GROUPED    |
   | Service-Dimension        | TBD3    | Section 3.2     | UTF8String |
   +--------------------------+---------+-----------------+------------+

6.  Security Considerations

   The Diameter base protocol [RFC6733] requires that each Diameter
   implementation use underlying security; i.e., TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP or
   IPsec.  These mechanisms are believed to provide sufficient
   protection under the normal Internet threat model; that is, assuming
   that the authorized nodes engaging in the protocol have not been
   compromised, but that the attacker has complete control over the
   communication channels between them.  This includes eavesdropping,
   message modification, insertion, and man-in-the-middle and replay
   attacks.  Note also that this application includes a mechanism for
   application layer replay protection by means of the Session-Id from
   [RFC6733] and CC- Request-Number, which is specified in this
   document.  The Diameter credit-control application is often used
   within one domain, and there may be a single hop between the peers.
   In these environments, the use of TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP or IPsec is
   sufficient.  The details of TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP or IPsec related
   security considerations are discussed in the [RFC6733].

   Because this application conveys past usage information (directly or
   indirectly), it increases the interest for various security attacks.
   Therefore, all parties communicating with each other MUST be
   authenticated, including, for instance, TLS client-side
   authentication.  In addition, authorization of the client SHOULD be
   emphasized; i.e., that the client is allowed to perform credit-
   control for a certain user.  The specific means of authorization are

   outside of the scope of this specification but can be, for instance,
   manual configuration.

   The attributes provided by this solution MUST be assumed to be
   privacy sensitive by both the client and server.
