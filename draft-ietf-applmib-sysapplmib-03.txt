 Internet Draft      System Application MIB      Sept. 10, 1996


 1.  Abstract

 This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
 Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
 protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it
 describes a basic set of managed objects for fault,
 configuration and performance management of applications from
 a systems perspective.  More specifically, the managed objects
 are restricted to information that can be determined from the
 system itself and which does not require special
 instrumentation within the applications to make the
 information available.

 This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
 community.



 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

 The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
 components.  They are:

 o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [1] defines MIB-II, the core set of
      managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

 o    RFC 1902 Structure of Management Information for Version
      2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

 o    RFC 1903 Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

 o    RFC 1904 Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the
      Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

 o    RFC 1905 Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

 o    RFC 1906 Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

 o    RFC 1907 Management Information Base for Version 2 of the
      Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)

      the Internet-standard Network Management Framework


 The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
 purpose of experimentation and evaluation.


 2.1.  Object Definitions

 Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
 termed the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the
 MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
 One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI[1]. In particular, each object
 type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively
 assigned name. The object type together with an object
 instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
 of the object. For human convenience, we often use a textual
 string, termed the object descriptor, to refer to the object
 type.

 3.  Overview

 The primary purpose of computing technologies is the execution
 of application software. These applications, typically
 specialized collections of executables, files, and
 interprocess communications, exist to solve business,
 scientific or other "problems". The configuration, fault
 detection, performance monitoring and control of application
 software across it's life on a host computer is of great
 economic importance. For the purposes of our work, we define
 applications as one or more units of executable code and other
 resources, installed on a single host system that a manager
 may think of as a single object for management purposes.


 The information described by the objects in the System
 Application MIB support configuration, fault, and performance
 management; they represent some of the basic attributes of
 application software from a systems (non-application specific)
 perspective.  The information allows for the description of
 applications as collections of executables and files installed
 and executing on a host computer.

 This draft is concerned primarily with, and defines a model
 for, application information resident on a host computer which
 can be determined from the system itself, and not from the
 individual applications.  This system-level view of
 applications is designed to provide information about software
 applications installed and running on the host system without
 requiring modifications and code additions to the applications
 themselves.  This approach was taken to insure ease and speed
 of implementation, while allowing room for future growth.

 We believe that this work will be immediately followed by work
 on a separate MIB module that will provide an application-
 level view of a single application.  This new "appl MIB" will
 define a common set of attributes that pertains to a generic
 application, but which requires instrumentation (and therefor
 modification) to the application software itself in order to
 be implemented.

 4.  Architecture for Application Management

 In the area of application management it is fully acknowledged
 and even expected that additional MIB modules will be defined
 over time to provide even greater level of detail regarding
 applications. This MIB module presents the most general case:
 a set of management objects relating to generic applications
 whose object values can be determined from the computer system
 itself and do not require instrumentation within the
 application.

 A finer grained level of detail is planned for the future
 "appl MIB" which will be a common set of management objects
 relating to generic applications, but which require some type
 of instrumentation in the application in order to be
 determined.  Since this new MIB module will provide a finer
 level of detail, any connection to the sysAppl MIB should be
 made by having pointers from this more detailed MIB back to
 the more generic sysAppl MIB.  Likewise, as application-
 specific MIB modules such as the HTTP MIB, etc., are developed
 over time, these more specific MIBs should reference back to
 the more generic MIBs.

 In all cases of MIB design, it is recommended that when
 chosing the index for a table, the arbitrary small integer
 index should be passed over in favor of a more meaningful,
 derivable value whenever possible.  A derivable value makes it
 easier for a separately implemented MIB module (possibly on a
 different sub-agent) to match the table index for a table in
 another MIB.

 While this MIB module does not attempt to provide every
 detailed piece of information for managing applications, it
 does provide a basic systems-level view of the applications
 and their components on a single host system.

 5.  The Structure of the MIB

 The System Application MIB structure models application
 packages as a whole, and also models the individual elements
 (files and executables) which collectively form an
 application.  The MIB is structured to model information
 regarding installed application packages and the elements
 which make up each application package. The MIB also models
 activity information on applications (and in turn, their
 components) that are running or have previously run on the
 host system.  In modelling applications and their elements,
 this MIB module provides the necessary link for associating
 executing processes with the applications of which they are a
 part.

 The objects are arranged into the following groups:

     -  System Application Installed Group
            - sysApplInstallPkgTable
            - sysApplInstallElmtTable

     -  System Application Run Group
            - sysApplRunTable
            - sysApplPastRunTable
            - sysApplElmtRunTable
            - sysApplElmtPastRunTable
            - (scalars for restricting table sizes)


 As can be seen by the arrangement above, for each category,
 the MIB first treats an application package as a whole, and
 then breaks down the package to provide information about each
 of the elements (executable and non-executable files) of the
 package.


 5.1.  System Application Installed Group

 The System Application Installed group consists of two tables.
 Through these two tables, administrators will be able to
 determine which applications have been installed on a system
 and what their constituent components are.  The first table,
 the sysApplInstallPkgTable, lists the application packages
 installed on a particular host. The second, the
 sysApplInstallElmtTable, provides information regarding the

 Internet Draft      System Application MIB      Sept. 10, 1996


 executables and non executable files, or elements, which
 collectively compose an application. This information is
 discoverable provided that certain conventions are followed by
 administrators during the installation of host application
 software.

 NOTE: This MIB is intended to work with applications that have
 been installed on a particular host, where "installed" means
 that the existence of the application and the association
 between an application and its component files can be
 discovered without requiring additional instrumentation of the
 application itself.


 5.2.  System Application Run Group

 This group models activity information for applications that
 have been invoked and are either currently running, or have
 previously run, on the host system.  Likewise, the individual
 elements of an invoked application are also modeled to show
 currently running processes, and processes that have run in
 the past.  This information is modeled using two pairs of
 tables: a pair of tables for the application run and past run,
 and a pair for the elements running and past run.  Seven
 scalars are also defined to control the size of the past run
 tables.



 5.2.1.  sysApplRunTable and sysApplPastRunTable

 The sysApplRunTable and the sysApplPastRunTable make up the
 first pair of tables.  The sysApplRunTable contains the
 application instances which are currently running on the host.
 Each time an application is invoked, a new entry is created in
 the sysApplRunTable to provide information about that
 particular invocation of the application.  An entry will
 remain in this table until the application instance
 terminates, at which time the entry will be deleted from the
 sysApplRunTable and placed in the sysApplPastRunTable.

 The sysApplPastRunTable maintains a history of instances of
 applications which have previously executed on the host.
 Entries to this table are made when an invoked application
 from the sysApplRunTable has terminated; the table entry which

 Internet Draft      System Application MIB      Sept. 10, 1996


 represents the application instance is removed from the
 SysApplRunTable and is added to the sysApplPastRunTable.

 Because the sysApplPastRunTable will continuously grow as
 applications are executed and terminate, two scalars are
 defined to control the ageing-out of table entries. The value
 of sysApplPastRunMaxRows specifies the maximum number of
 entries the table may contain, whilst the
 sysApplPastRunTblTimeLimit specifies the maximum age of the
 table entries.  Oldest entries are removed first.

 It is important to note that the sysApplRunTable and
 sysApplPastRunTable contain entries for each INVOCATION of an
 application. A single application package might be invoked
 multiple times by different users; each invocation is properly
 recorded by a separate entry in the sysApplRunTable.



 5.2.2.  sysApplElmtRunTable and sysApplElmtPastRunTable

 While the sysApplRunTable and sysApplPastRunTable focussed on
 applications as a whole, the sysApplElmtRunTable and
 sysApplElmtPastRunTable provide information regarding an
 application's executable elements, (processes), which are
 either currently executing or have executed in the past.


 The sysApplElmtRunTable contains an entry for every process
 currently running on the host.  An entry is created in this
 table for each instance of a process at the time it is
 started, and will remain in the table until the process
 terminates.  Note that in order to provide complete
 information on load on the system, this table lists EVERY
 running process, not just those processes that are running as
 part of an identified application.  However, when processes
 terminate, only those entries which are part of an identified
 application are moved to the sysApplElmtPastRunTable.


 The sysApplElmtPastRunTable maintains a history of instances
 of processes which have previously executed on the host as
 part of an application. When a process from the
 sysApplElmtRunTable terminates, the entry is moved to this
 sysApplElmtPastRunTable provided that the process was part of

 an identified application.  If the process cannot be
 associated to any 'parent' application, than it is simply
 removed from the sysApplElmtRunTable.  This allows for
 processes like 'ps' or 'grep' to show up in the Running table,
 (where they are consuming resources and are thus,
 "interesting"), but not in the Past Run table.

 Because the sysApplElmtPastRunTable will continuously grow as
 processes are executed and terminate, two scalars are defined
 to control the ageing-out of table entries.  The value of
 sysApplElmtPastRunMaxRows specifies the maximum number of
 entries the table may contain, whilst the
 sysApplElmtPastRunTblTimeLimit specifies the maximum age of
 the table entries.  Oldest entries are removed first.

         Each entry represents a process which has previously
         executed and is associated with the invoked application
         of which it was a part.  Because an invoked application
         may involve more than one executable, it is possible
         to have multiple entries in this table for
         each application invocation. Entries are added

 7.  Security Considerations

 In order to implement this MIB, an agent must make certain
 management information available about various logical and
 physical entities within a managed system, which may be
 considered sensitive in some network environments.

 Therefore, a network administrator may wish to employ
 instance-level access control, and configure the Entity MIB
 access (i.e., community strings in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C), such
 that certain instances within this MIB (e.g.,
 entLogicalCommunity, or entire entLogicalEntries,
 entPhysicalEntries, and associated mapping table entries), are
 excluded from particular MIB views.
