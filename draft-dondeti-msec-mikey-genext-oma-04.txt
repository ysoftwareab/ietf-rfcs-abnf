Internet-Draft  OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload  February 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) protocol specification [1]
   defines a General Extension payload to allow possible extensions to
   MIKEY without having to allocate a new payload type.  The General
   Extension payload can be used in any MIKEY message and is part of the
   authenticated/signed data part.  There is an 8-bit type field in that
   payload and the type code assignment is IANA managed and RFC 3830
   requires IETF consensus for assignments from the public range of
   0-240.

   The Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA) Browser and Content (BAC) Broadcast
   (BCAST) group's Service and Content Protection specification [2]
   specifies the use of a short term key message (STKM) and a long term
   key message (LTKM) that carry attributes related to Service and
   Content protection.  Note that any keys associated with the
   attributes are part of the MIKEY KEMAC payload.  This document
   specifies the use of the General Extension payload of MIKEY to carry
   the LTKMs or STKMs.

   RFC 3830, the MIKEY General Extension payload defined in [3] along
   with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)'s Multimedia
   Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) [4] document specify the transport
   of MIKEY messages via unicast or broadcast and the OMA specifications
   use either for transport of MIKEY messages.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].

      OMA BCAST STKM/LTKM MIKEY General Extension : We refer to the
      General Extension type -- value, to be assigned by IANA -- as the
      OMA BCAST STKM/LTKM MIKEY General Extension .

                Figure 1: OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension

   Section 6.1 of RFC 3830 specifies the first three fields of the
   General Extension Payload and defines a variable length Data field.
   This document specifies the use of Type XX [To be filled in by the
   RFC Editor after IANA assignment] for OMA BCAST Service and Content
   Protection using the Smartcard Profile.  The contents of the variable
   length data field are defined below.

      Sub Type: 8 bits.  This field indicates the type of the OMA BCAST
      payload.  In this specification, only two values are specified:
      LTKM (1), and STKM (2).

      Sub Type Specific Data: Variable length.  The contents of this
      field are defined in Section 6 of the OMA BCAST Service and
      Content Protection specification [2].

4.  Interoperability considerations

   This document specifies the use of MIKEY General Extension Payload
   Type XX [to be assigned by IANA based on IETF review] and a couple of
   subtype values (1 and 2), one each for OMA BCAST Service and Content
   protection's STKM and LTKM payloads.  Interoperability considerations
   span several standards bodies, with OMA BCAST 1.0 enabler compliance
   being the key aspect; as such it is up to the OMA test planning to
   verify the interoperability and compliance of OMA BCAST 1.0
   implementations.  This payload type assignment does not change MIKEY
   beyond RFC 3830 and [3].

5.  Security Considerations

   According to RFC 3830, the general extension payload can be used in
   any MIKEY message and is part of the authenticated/signed data part.
   The parameters proposed to be included in the OMA BCAST MIKEY General
   Extension payload (listed in Section 3) need only to be integrity
   protected, which is already allowed by the MIKEY specification.  The
   OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload SHALL be integrity
   protected.  Furthermore, keys or any parameters that require
   confidentiality MUST NOT be included in the General Extension
   Payload.  If Keys or other confidential data are to be transported
   via the General Extension Payload, such data MUST be encrypted and
   encapsulated independently.  Finally, note that MIKEY already
   provides replay protection and that protection covers the General
   Extension Payload also.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new General Extension Type from the
   "General Extensions payload name spaces" in the IANA registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey-payloads for use by OMA BCAST.
   Furthermore, IANA is requested to maintain a list of corresponding
   subtypes (0-255) as follows:

      0 ...  Reserved

      1 ...  LTKM

      2 ...  STKM

      3 ... 191 (maintained by IANA and assigned by IETF Review[6])

      192 ... 255 (Private use)
