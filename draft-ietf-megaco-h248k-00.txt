3.3.4 Procedures

   An MGC may send a fixed play announcements message to the MG.  An MG
   receiving such a signal plays the indicated announcement (indicated

   by the name parameter) for the duration specified by the noc
   parameter.  If an noc parameter is not included, the MG uses a
   default of 1 cycle.

   To provide additional information when an announcement is to be
   played, the MGC sends a play variable announcement signal to the MG.
   An MG receiving such a signal plays the indicated announcement
   (indicated by the name parameter) for the duration specified by the
   noc parameter.  If an noc parameter is not included, the MG uses a
   default of 1.  If the sp parameter is included, the MG uses the
   Specific parameters interpretation parameter to identify the
   particular type of information to be included in the announcement.
   Examples of the types of Specific parameters include a telephone
   number, date, or time.
