               IS-IS Extensions for Link Bit Error Ratio
                     draft-li-lsr-isis-link-ber-00

Abstract

   In certain networks, network-performance criteria (e.g., latency) are
   becoming as critical to data-path selection as other metrics.  This
   document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Metric Extensions (RFC 8570).  This draft provides the necessary IS-
   IS extensions about the link bit error ratio (LBER) that need to be
   used to describe network-performance.

1.  Introduction

   In certain networks, network-performance criteria (e.g., latency) are
   becoming as critical to data-path selection as other metrics.  This
   document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Metric Extensions (RFC 8570).  This draft provides the necessary IS-
   IS extensions about the link bit errror ratio (LBER) that need to be
   used to describe network-performance.A new sub-TLV is introduced for
   IS-IS.

   As other IS-IS TE Metric Extensions (e.g., unidirectional link loss,
   unidirectional link delay), Unidirectional link bit error ratio
   described in this dicument is also meant to be used as part of the
   operation of the routing protocol to enhance Constrained Shortest
   Path First (CSPF), or for other uses such as supplementing the data
   used by the controller to compute the policy path.

2.  LBER Extensions to IS-IS

   This document registers a new IS-IS TE sub-TLV in the "Sub-TLVs for
   TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222, and 223" registry.  This new sub-TLV provides
   ways to distribute LBER.

   This document registers a sub-TLV:

           Type    Description
           ----------------------------------------------------
           TBD     Unidirectional Link BIT ERROR RATIO

                                 Figure 1

   The new sub-TLV include a bit called the Anomalous (or "A") bit.
   When the A bit is clear (or when the sub-TLV does not include an A
   bit), the sub-TLV describes steady-state link performance.

3.  Sub-TLV Details

3.1.  Unidirectional Link BIT ERROR RATIO Sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV advertises the bit error ratio between two directly
   connected IS-IS neighbors.  The link bit error ratio advertised by
   this sub-TLV MUST be the packet bit error from the local neighbor to
   the remote neighbor (i.e., the forward-path loss).  The format of
   this sub-TLV is shown in the following diagram:

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   Type        |     Length    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+
     |A|  RESERVED   |               Link Bit Error Ratio            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+

    Figure 2: Unidirectional Link BIT ERROR RATIO Sub-TLV for the IS-IS
                                 extension

   Type: TBD (suggested value 40) is to be assigned by IANA.

   Length: 4.

   A bit: This field represents the Anomalous (A) bit.  The A bit is set
   when the measured value of this parameter exceeds its configured
   maximum threshold.  The A bit is cleared when the measured value
   falls below its configured reuse threshold.  If the A bit is cleared,
   the sub-TLV represents steady-state link performance.

   RESERVED: This field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to 0
   when sent and MUST be ignored when received.

   Link Bit Error Ratio: This 24-bit field carries Link Bit Error Ratio
   as a percentage of the total traffic sent over a configurable
   interval.  The basic unit is 0.000003%, where (2^24 - 2) is
   50.331642%.  This value is the highest link bit error percentage that
   can be expressed (the assumptions being that (1) precision is more
   important on high-speed links than the ability to advertise link bit
   error ratio greater than this and (2) high-speed links with over 50%
   bit error are unusable).  Therefore, measured values that are larger
   than the field maximum SHOULD be encoded as the maximum value.

   This sub-TLV is optional.

4.  Announcement Thresholds and Filters

   This document uses the same principle for announcement thresholds and
   filters as described in RFC 8570.

5.  Announcement Suppression

   This document uses the same principle for announcement suppression as
   described in RFC 8570.

6.  Network Stability and Announcement Periodicity

   This document uses the same principle for network stability and
   announcement periodicity as described in RFC 8570.

7.  Enabling and Disabling Sub-TLVs

   Implementations MUST make it possible to enable or disable each sub-
   TLV based on configuration.

8.  Compatibility

   Unrecognized sub-TLVs should be silently ignored.

9.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA allocates new sub-TLV types as
   defined in Section 2 from the "Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 25, 141,
   222, and 223 (Extended IS reachability, IS Neighbor Attribute, L2

11.  Security Considerations

   These extensions to IS-IS do not add any new security issues to the
   existing IGP.
