0. Abstract

   STD 39 [STD39], "Specification for the Interconnection of a Host and
   an IMP" describes technology which is no longer used.  This documents
   requests that STD 39 be moved to historic status.

1. Details

   During a review of internet standards, it was brought to the
   attention of the IESG that the ARPANET Host-IMP protocol, was still
   listed as an Internet Standard, STD 39.  Since this protocol has not
   been in use in the public internet for 20 or more years, the IESG
   proposes to reclassify it to historic.
