Abstract 
    
   This document defines a PKI repository locator service. The service 
   makes use of DNS SRV records defined in accordance with RFC 2782. The 
   service enables certificate using systems to locate PKI repositories

1.   Overview 
    
   Operational protocols have been specified for retrieval of PKI data, 
   including public-key certificates and revocation information, from 
   PKI repositories in a number of RFCs including RFC 2559, RFC 2560     
   and RFC 2585. These RFCs assume that a certificate using system has 
   the knowledge information necessary to identify, locate and connect 
   to the PKI repository with a specific protocol. Although there are 
   some tools available in protocol-specific environments for this 
   purpose, such as knowledge references in directory systems, these are 
   restricted to use with a single protocol and do not share a common 
   means of publication. This draft provides a solution to this problem 
   through the use of SRV RRs in DNS. This solution is expected to be 
   particularly useful in environments where only a domain name is 
   available. In other situations (e.g. where a certificate is available 
   that contains the required information), such a DNS lookup is not 
   needed. 
    
   RFC 2782 defines a DNS RR for specifying the location of services 
   (SRV). This Internet-draft defines SRV records for a PKI repository 
   locator service to enable PKI clients to obtain the necessary 
   information to connect to a domain's PKI repository, including 
   information about each protocol that is supported by that domain for 
   access to its repository. This Internet-draft includes the definition 
   of a SRV RR format for this service and an example of its potential 
   use in an email environment. 
    
2.   SRV RR definition

                               PKIXREP                 September 2005 
 
 
   The format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33, is: 
    
    _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target 
    
   For the PKI repository locator service, this draft uses the symbolic 
   name "PKIXREP". Note that when used in an SRV RR, this name MUST 
   be prepended with a "_" character. 
    
   The protocols that can be included in PKIXREP SRV RRs are: 
    
      Protocol     SRV Prefix 
    
      LDAP         _LDAP 
      HTTP         _HTTP 
      OCSP         _OCSP 
       
2.1     Assignment of new protocol prefixes 
    
   Protocol prefix assignments for new PKIX repository protocols SHOULD 
   be defined in the document that specifies the protocol. 
    
2.2     Use of multiple repositories 
    
   The existence of multiple repositories MAY be determined by making 
   separate DNS queries for each of the protocols supported by the 
   client. 
    
   If this approach is found to be unacceptably inefficient due to a 
   proliferation of repository protocols at a future date the service 
   discovery protocol could be extended to allow the repository to 
   advertise the protocols supported. 
    
2.3     SRV RR example 
    
   This example uses fictional domain "example.com" as an aid in 
   understanding the use of SRV records by a certificate using system. 
    
   Let an email client that needs a certificate for a recipient be Alice 
   and assume that Alice's client system supports LDAP for certificate 
   retrieval. Let the message recipient be Bob and let Bob's email 
   address be bob@example.com. Assume that example.test maintains a 
   "border directory" PKI repository and that Bob's certificate is 
   available from that directory "border.example.com" via LDAP.   
    
   Alice's client system retrieves, via DNS, the SRV record for 
   _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com.  
    
        - the QNAME of the DNS query is _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com 
        - the QCLASS of the DNS query is IN

        - the QTYPE of the DNS query is SRV 
    
   The result SHOULD include the host address for example.com's border 
   directory system. 
    
   Note that if example.com operated their service on a number of hosts, 
   more than one SRV RR would be returned. In this case, RFC 2782 
   defines the procedure to be followed in determining which of these 
   should be accessed first. 
    
3.   Security considerations 
    
   Security issues regarding PKI repositories themselves are outside the 
   scope of this specification. For LDAP repositories, for example, 
   specific security considerations are addressed in RFC 2559. 
    
   Security issues with respect to the use of SRV records in general are 
   addressed in RFC 2782 and these issues apply to the use of SRV 
   records in the context of the PKIXREP service defined here. 
    
4.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document reserves the use of "_PKIXREP" Service label. Since 
   this relates to a service which may pass messages over a number of 
   different message transports, they must be associated with a specific 
   transport. 
    
   In order to ensure that the association between "_PKIXREP" and their 
   respective underlying services is deterministic, this document 
   requests that IANA create a registry: The PKIX SRV Protocol Label.  
    
   For this registry, an entry shall consist of a label name and a 
   pointer to a specification describing how the protocol named in the 
   label uses SRV. Specifications should conform to the requirements 
   listed in RFC 2434 for "specification required".
