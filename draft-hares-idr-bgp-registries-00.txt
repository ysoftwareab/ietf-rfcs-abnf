                 BGP Regisries by IDR and other BGP WGs
                 draft-hares-idr-bgp-registries-00.txt

Abstract

   The BGP Registries at IANA were set-up as one of the earliest IANA
   registries.  Over time, the registries have become denoted as
   requiring "standards action", "early allocation", "FCFS (first-come,
   first server)", "vendor specific", and "IETF review".  This draft
   proposes that certain BGP registries that are labelled "standards
   action", "early allocation", or "IETF Review" add to these
   registration actions a "Expert Review.  It also proposes that the
   chairs of BGP Protocol related WG groups be part of the review team.
   The intent is that these chairs will be responsible to bring
   questionable allocations to their workings attention.

   The BGP relate working groups are currently the IDR, BESS, SIDROPS,
   and GROW, but other working groups like SPRING might be added.

1.  Introduction

   During 2016, several BGP attributes were squatted upon causing
   operational problems during the early deployment of large communities
   [RFC8092].  Due these problems, [RFC8093] deprecated the use of 5
   attribute numbers.

   To avoid this problem in the future, it is helpful to increase pace
   of early-allocations process and to coordinate the review of key BGP
   registries.  This document proposes to augment existing registration
   process for BGP registries with Expert review.

   This draft proposes that certain BGP registries that are labelled
   "standards action", "early allocation", or "IETF Review" add to these
   registration actions a "Expert Review.  It also recommends that the
   chairs of BGP Protocol related WG groups be part of the review team.

2.  BGP Registries to Change Registration Process on

   This document proposes the IETF BGP registries in Table 1 below to
   require their curent registration policy plus Expert Review.  It
   recommends that the chairs of the BGP related working groups (e.g.
   IDR, Bess, SIDROPS, GROW) be a part of this review team.  The IESG
   can define which working groups are BGP working groups, but it is
   important to get the chairs of the Working Groups that originate or
   maintain the drafts in Table 1 as part of the review team.

   If no BGP WG groups remain, the IESG may select designated experts to
   fulfill this role.

   The registries in Table 2 have Expert Review.  This document requests
   that IANA increase their designated expert pool by adding the pool of
   chairs in BGP related Working Groups (E.g.  IDR, BESS, SIDROPS,
   GROW).
