Proactive energy management for smart city with edge 
computing using meta-reinforcement learning scheme
                        draft-hongcs-t2trg-pem-00

Abstract

Renewable energy enabled sustainable energy management ensures 
a high degree of reliability in order to fulfill the energy 
demand of a smart city. In such case, renewable energy 
generation is random over time and also energy consumption of 
smart city users’ is nondeterministic in nature. Therefore, to   
ensure sustainable energy management for smart city, 
a proactive energy management scheme should be integrated into 
smart city network. In which, edge node should be considered as 
local computational unit for each energy user and microgrid 
controller should be played the role of energy management decision
aggregator. As a result, proactive energy management scheme
not only overcomes the challenges of renewable energy-aware 
demand scheduling but also establishes a strong relationship 
for both energy generation and consumption over time. 
Therefore, a distributed mechanism is considered, where the edge 
node for executing local agent to determine an individual 
users’ policy with respect to energy consumption and renewable 
energy generation (users’ own sources). On the other hand, 
microgrid controller determines meta-policy through a meta-agent 
with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Since a meta-agent accepts 
local policy as an input with historical observations, which 
ensures fast and efficient execution of proactive energy management
for the smart city.

Internet-Draft  Proactive energy management for smart city  October 2020

1.  Introduction

In the modern development arena, smart city, and renewable energy 
are indispensable toward the ecological growth of urban technology 
to enable sustainable smart services [a,b]. A microgrid is 
capable to fulfill that huge amount of energy demand by enabling 
the efficient demand scheduling of smart city energy consumptions. 
However, the challenges come with the unpredictable nature of 
both energy consumption and renewable generation, which also have 
a strong relationship over the history of energy consumption and 
generation [c,d].

Therefore, to overcome those challenges, a proactive energy 
management is essential such that both energy consumption 
and renewable energy generation can be considered. In order to 
do that, meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL)-based [e] 
energy scheduling model, in which this method is capable of 
handling both energy consumption and generation with the historical 
and current observations using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Proactive energy management for the smart city should be solved by 
distributed manner. 
	. First, a local agent with an edge computing facility determines 
	  a local policy with respect to energy consumption and generation
	  (user’s own renewable sources) for its nearby energy users’. 

	. Second, by reusing the historical observations and local policy, 
	   the microgrid controller estimates the meta-policy for energy 
	   scheduling. Further, it takes necessary action based on meta-policy 
	   to enable sustainable energy management for the smart city.

2.   Energy Data Flow Management

The Microgrid-powered smart city includes both renewable and 
non-renewable energy sources, where each individual building 
has its own renewable (solar) energy sources. The city 
connected with edge computing enabled wireless networks 
to fulfill smart city services. Each energy user (i.e.,
home, building, school, commercial building, and so on) 
is associated with its nearby edge computing server. Energy
demand, renewable generation, and required amount should send
to its associated edge server. Based on each user data, edge
server determine its own local energy management policy by
applying Deep Q-learning. The output (reward(t), action(t)
reward(t-1), action(t-1)) should send to microgrid controller.
Microgrid controller decides the overall energy management 
policy for the smart city and send feed back to each user
via edge server. The communication should be through the wireless 
communications protocol (LTE, 5G, LTU, Wifi, etc.) for exchanging
the energy management data.

Energy data flow of proactive energy management for smart 
city as shown in Figure 1.
	. Energy user with renewable energy sources can send energy 
	demand and generation raw data to MEC Server # in smart 
	city network

	. Each energy user's observational data (reward and action) 
	by executing reinforcement learning (Deep Q-learning) from 
	MEC should send to microgrid controller
	
	. Other energy sources (except the energy sources that are 
	associated with smart city user) should send to microgrid 
	controller
	
	. Microgrid controller send the energy management executing
	command to each users’

3.  Proactive Energy Management for Smart City

Each edge server estimates the local policy for the associated energy 
users while Microgrid controller determines the meta policy using 
a little amount of information from local policy. Establishing a 
strong correlation between energy generation and consumption using 
Markovian properties for each energy user.

3.1 Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Edge Computing

The proactive energy demand scheduling for smart city problem 
is solved distributively, where first, obtain the local policy 
by learning the local agent with respect to energy consumption 
and renewable energy generation through the nearby edge server. 
Second, in order to generate meta-policy, we send local policy 
information to the microgrid controller alone with previous 
policy observation, so that meta-agent can learn very fast 
with the optimal decision. This procedure is the same for 
every energy user and meta-RL model procedure is shown in 
Figure 3.
