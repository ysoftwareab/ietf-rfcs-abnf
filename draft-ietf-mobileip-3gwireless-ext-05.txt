Abstract 
    
   This document defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol [1] to 
   allow mobility management for the interface between a radio network 
   and a packet data network in the third generation cdma2000 network.  
    
   Mobile IP requires link layer connectivity between the Mobile Node 
   and the Foreign Agent. This draft proposes a protocol for achieving 
   this when the physical layer terminates at a point distant from the 
   FA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000 networks where 
   the physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and the 
   FA resides inside a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). The 
   PDSN is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating 
   the link layer to the Mobile Node. A RNN is responsible for relaying 
   the link layer protocol between a Mobile Node and its corresponding 
   PDSN.  
    
   The interface between the RNN and the PDSN is called the RP 
   interface. This interface requires mobility management for handling 
   handoff from one RNN to another without interrupting end to end 
   communication. It also requires the support of the link layer 
   protocol encapsulation.

   this when the physical layer terminates at a point distant from the 
   FA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000 networks where 
   the physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and the 
   FA resides inside a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). The 
   PDSN is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating 
   the link layer to the Mobile Node. A RNN is responsible for relaying 
   the link layer protocol between a Mobile Node and its corresponding 
   PDSN.  
    
   The interface between the RNN and the PDSN is called the RP 
   interface. This interface requires mobility management for handling 
   handoff from one RNN to another without interrupting end to end 
   communication. It also requires the support of the link layer 
   protocol encapsulation. 
    
   The messages used for mobility management across the RP interface 
   include Registration Request, Registration Reply, Registration 
   Update and Registration Acknowledge. Both Registration Request and 
   Registration Update messages MUST be sent with UDP using well-known 
   port number 699.

       Figure 1: The Third Generation cdma2000 Network RP Interface 
    
   In above figure 1, the PDSN will be responsible for establishing, 
   maintaining, and terminating the link layer to the Mobile Node. It 
   initiates the authentication, authorization, and accounting for the 
   Mobile Node and optionally, securely tunnels to the Home Agent.  
    
   The RNN is responsible for mapping the Mobile Node identifier 
   reference to a unique link layer identifier used to communicate with 
   the PDSN. RNN validates the Mobile Station for access service and 
   manages the physical layer connection to the Mobile Node.  
    
    
4. Mobile IP Extensions 
    
   This section describes extensions to the Mobile IP protocol for the 
   RP interface within the third generation cdma2000 network.  
    
4.1 Registration Request 
    
   In a cdma2000 network, the mobile node initiates a connection by 
   sending a call setup indication to the RNN across the radio network. 
   When this indication is received by a RNN, a Registration Request 
   will be sent from the RNN to the PDSN to setup a new RP session.  
    
   A RNN MUST send a Registration Request with the GRE encapsulation 
   and the reverse tunneling bit set. The Home Address field is set to 
   zero. The Home Agent field will be assigned to the IP address of the 
   PDSN and the Care-of Address field will be assigned to the IP 
   address of RNN. 
    
   When a Registration Request is received by a PDSN, the information 
   from the Session Specific Extension (see next section) will be used 
   to identify a RP session. When a registration is accepted, a GRE 
   tunnel will be created for this Mobile Node.  
    
   The message is sent with UDP using well-known port number 699. 
    
   The fields of the Registration Request message are shown below: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

                        This field is assigned to the IP address of  
                        RNN. 
    
        Extensions 
                        The Session Specific Extension as described in 
                        the next section MUST be included along with 
                        the ones described in RFC2002. Specifically, 
                        the MN-HA Authentication extension as described 
                        in RFC2002 MUST be included along with this 
                        extension.

        MN Connection ID 
                        This is a two octet field and it is used to 
                        differentiate the multiple sessions from the 
                        same Mobile Node. It is locally unique to a 
                        Mobile Node. 
    
        MN ID Type  
                        This is a two octet field and it indicates the 
                        type of the following Mobile Node ID value.  
                         
                        Type value 1 will be reserved for International 
                        Mobile Station Identity (IMSI) encoded in ASCII 
                        format. For detailed description of the IMSI, 
                        see reference [8].  
         
        MN ID Length 
                        This is a one octet field and it indicates the  
                        length (in bytes) of the following Mobile Node  
                        ID field. For IMSI MN ID encoded in ASCII  
                        format, the length field value ranges from 10

                       For Type 1 MN ID, the most significant digit of  
                        IMSI will be coded in ASCII and stored as the  
                        most significant byte of the MN ID.  
     
                        
                        
   This extension MUST be included in the Registration Request, 
   Registration Reply, Registration Update and Registration Acknowledge 
   (see section 4.5) messages. It will be included before the MN-HA 
   Authentication extension in the Registration Request and 
   Registration Reply messages and before the Registration Update 
   Authentication Extension in the Registration Update and Registration 
   Acknowledge messages. 
    
   The MN ID and the MN Connection ID together will uniquely identify a 
   Mobile Session. 
    
4.3 Registration Reply 
    
   The Registration Reply will be sent by a PDSN following the 
   procedure as described in [1]. The Home Address field will be the 
   same value as the Home Address field from the corresponding 
   Registration Request message received by the PDSN.  
    
   The message is sent with UDP to the source port of the received 
   Registration Request message. 
                
4.4 Registration Update/Acknowledge 
    
   Two new messages are defined to support PDSN initiated RP tunnel 
   tear down and to speed up resource reclamation on the RNN. 
    
   The Registration Update message is used for notification of the 
   change of the registration associated with a call. It shall be sent 
   by the PDSN to the previous RNN when a RNN to RNN handoff happens.  
    
   The Registration Update message is sent with UDP using well-known 
   port number 699. And the Registration Acknowledge message is sent 
   with UDP to the source port from the received correspondent 
   Registration Update message.

4.5 Registration Update Authentication Extension 
    
   The Registration Update Authentication extension is used to 
   authenticate the Registration Update and Registration Acknowledge 
   messages. It has the same format and default algorithm support 
   requirements as the authentication extension defined for Mobile IP 
   protocol [1], but with a different type (40).  The authenticator 
   value is computed from the stream of bytes including the shared 
   secret, the UDP payload all prior extensions in their entirety, and 
   the type and length of this extension, but not including the 
   authenticator field itself nor the UDP header. The secret used for 
   computing the authenticator field is shared between the RN and PDSN. 
   This extension is required in both Registration Update and 
   Registration Acknowledge messages.

4.6 Summary 
    
   The extensions to Mobile IP include enabling the GRE encapsulation 
   and reverse tunneling during Registration. A new extension called 
   Session Specific Extension is defined and is mandatory in the 
   Registration Request, Registration Reply, Registration Update and 
   Registration Acknowledge messages. The Home Address field MUST be 
   set to zero in the Registration Request, Registration Reply, 
   Registration Update and Registration Acknowledge messages.  
    
   Two new messages (Registration Update and Registration Acknowledge) 
   are defined to support the RP session disconnection in order to 
   speed up resource reclamation. 
    
    
5.0 GRE Encapsulation 
    
   GRE encapsulation as described in [3] shall be supported during user 
   data transmission. A new protocol type might be required to support 
   the link layer protocol defined for the third generation cdma2000 
   network. The Key field shall be required and its value shall be same 
   as the one from the Session Specific Extension as described above. 
   The sequence number may be required, depending on the requirement of 
   the protocol encapsulated within the GRE frame. 
    
   During traffic tunneling, the sender will insert the Key value from 
   the Registration Request message into the Key field of the GRE 
   header. The receiver will use the Key value from the GRE header to 
   decide where to forward the user data. 
 
6.0 IANA Considerations 
    
   This document specifies two new messages and two new extensions to 
   Mobile IP protocol [1]. The numbers to be assigned to these messages 
   and extensions have been taken from the numbering space assigned to 
   Mobile IP in RFC 2002 [1] and extended in RFC 2356 [4]. 
    
   The Registration Request and Registration Update messages MUST be 
   sent with UDP using well-known port number 699. This port number is 
   chosen from the unassigned port range as specified in RFC1700 [9]. 
    
   The Registration Update and Registration Acknowledge messages 
   defined in section 4.4 MUST be assigned the Type values of 20 and 21 
   respectively.  
    
   The Session Specific Extension defined in section 4.2 MUST be 
   assigned the Type value of 39, and the Registration Update 
   Authentication Extension defined in section 4.5 MUST be assigned a 
   value of 40. The Status values defined in section 4.4 are the error 
   codes defined in RFC 2002 [1]. They correspond to the error values 
   conventionally associated with a rejection by a home agent (i.e.,

             <draft-ietf-mobileip-3Gwireless-ext-05.txt>    Nov. 2000 
 
 
   the values from the range 128-255). The IANA MUST record the Status 
   values as defined in section 4.4 of this document. 
    
   With these assignments, the Type values assigned to the two new 
   messages and to two new extensions, and the error values for the 
   Status field, have been identified as not conflicting with any 
   numbers defined for Mobile IP to date and documented at 
   http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/mobileip-numbers.  
    
    
7.0 Security Considerations 
    
   The protocol presented in this draft is designed for use over a 
   protected, private network between RNN and PDSN. Pre-arranged 
   security associations in the style of Mobile IPv4 are assumed to 
   exist among every (RNN, PDSN) pair that will form an RP connection.  
   Also, it is assumed that the session specific information is 
   authenticated by means outside the scope of this draft. 
    
   Several potential vulnerabilities exist if these assumptions are not 
   met. First, if the network connecting the RNN and PDSN is accessible 
   to an attacker, user traffic may be intercepted and/or spoofed if 
   there are no other end-to-end security mechanisms in place. Second, 
   the Mobile IP control messages must be authenticated, to prevent 
   tunnel setup and tear down by unauthorized parties. Mobile IP 
   Authentication Extensions are used to provide this additional 
   protection for control messages. Finally, if session specific 
   information is not authenticated, a denial-of-service attack is 
   possible if a RNN unknowingly sends a registration request to the 
   PDSN with a spoofed session specific extension. The PDSN would then 
   send an explicit tunnel tear down to the previous RNN, causing user 
   traffic to be misdirected to the new RNN. This would cause a loss of 
   service and possibly interception of traffic, depending on what 
   other security measures are in place.
