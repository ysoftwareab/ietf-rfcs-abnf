     Abstract 

        We describe an experimental framework for constructing SAM sessions 
        using hybrid combinations of Application Layer Multicast, native 
        multicast, and multicast tunnels.  We leverage AMT [THA2006] relay 
        and gateway elements for interoperation between native regions and

     Internet-Draft    Hybrid Overlay Multicast Framework   January 27, 2007 
         

     1. Introduction 

        The concept of scalable adaptive multicast [BUF2007] includes both 
        scaling properties and adaptability properties.  Scalability is 
        intended to cover: 
        o  large group size 

        o  large numbers of small groups 

        o  rate of group membership change 

        o  admission control for QoS 

        o  use with network layer QoS mechanisms 

        o  varying degrees of reliability 

        o  trees connect nodes over global internet 

        Adaptability includes 
        o  use of different control mechanisms for different multicast trees 
           depending on initial application parameters or application class 

        o  changing multicast tree structure depending on changes in 
           application requirements, network conditions, and membership 

        o  use of different control mechanisms and tree structure in 
           different regions of network depending on native multicast 
           support, network characteristics, and node behavior 

        In this document we describe an experimental framework for 
        constructing SAM sessions using hybrid combinations of Application 
        Layer Multicast, native multicast, and multicast tunnels.

        Overlay network – An application layer virtual or logical network in 
        which end points are addressable and that provides connectivity, 
        routing, and messaging between end points. Overlay networks are 
        frequently used as a substrate for deploying new network services, or 
        for providing a routing topology not available from the underlying 
        physical network.  Many peer-to-peer systems are overlay networks 
        that run on top of the Internet. 
        In the above figure, “P” indicates overlay peers, and peers are 
        connected in a logical address space.  The links shown in the figure 
        represent predecessor/successor links.  Depending on the overlay 
        routing model, additional or different links may be present. 
     2.2. Overlay Multicast 

        Overlay Multicast (OM): Hosts participating in a multicast session 
        form an overlay network and utilize unicast connections among pairs 
        of hosts for data dissemination. The hosts in overlay multicast 
        exclusively handle group management, routing, and tree construction, 
        without any support from Internet routers. This is also commonly 
        known as Application Layer Multicast (ALM) or End System Multicast 
        (ESM). 
        We call systems which use proxies connected in an overlay multicast 
        backbone “proxied overlay multicast” or POM. 
     2.3. Peer 

        Peer: an autonomous end system that is connected to the physical 
        network and participates in and contributes resources to overlay 
        construction, routing and maintenance. Some peers may also perform 
        additional roles such as connection relays, super nodes, NAT 
        traversal, and data storage.

     2.4. Multi-Destination Routing 

        Multi-Destination Routing (MDR): A type of multicast routing in which 
        group member’s addresses are explicitly listed in each packet 
        transmitted from the sender [AGU1984].  XCAST [BOI2005] is an 
        experimental MDR protocol.  A hybrid host group and MDR design is 
        described in [HE2006]. 

     3. Assumptions 

     3.1. Overlay 

        Peers connect in a large-scale overlay, which may be used for a 
        variety of peer-to-peer applications in addition to multicast 
        sessions.  

        Peers may assume additional roles in the overlay beyond participation 
        in the overlay and in multicast trees. 

        We assume a single structured overlay routing algorithm is used.  Any 
        of a variety of multi-hop, one-hop, or variable-hop overlay 
        algorithms could be used. 

        Castro et al. [CAS2003] compared multi-hop overlays and found that 
        tree-based construction in a single overlay out-performed using 
        separate overlays for each multicast session.  We use a single 
        overlay rather than separate overlays per multicast sessions.  We 
        defer federated and hierarchical multi-overlay designs to later 
        versions of this document. 
        Peers may be distributed throughout the network, in regions where 
        native multicast (NM) is available as well as regions where it is not 
        available.  
        An overlay multicast algorithm may leverage the overlay’s mechanism 
        for maintaining overlay state in the face of churn.  For example, a 
        peer may hold a number of DHT (Distributed Hash Table) entries.  When 
        the peer gracefully leaves the overlay, it transfers those entries to 
        the nearest peer.  When another peers joins which is closer to some 
        of the entries than the current peer which holds those entries, than 
        those entries are migrated.  Overlay churn affects multicast trees as 
        well; remedies include automatic migration of the tree state and 
        automatic re-join operations for dislocated children nodes. 
     3.2. Overlay Multicast 

        The overlay supports concurrent multiple multicast trees.  The limit 
        on number of concurrent trees depends on peer and network resources 
      
      
     Buford                  Expires July 27, 2007                  [Page 5]

        and is not an intrinsic property of the overlay.  Some multicast 
        trees will contain peers use ALM only, i.e., the peers do not have NM 
        connectivity.  Some multicast trees will contain peers with a 
        combination of ALM and NM. Although the overlay could be used to form 
        trees of NM-only peers, if such peers are all in the same region we 
        expect native mechanisms to be used for such tree construction, and 
        if such peers are in different regions we expect AMT to handle most 
        cases of interest. 
        Peers are able to determine, through configuration or discovery: 
        o  Can they connect to a NM router 

        o  Is an AMT gateway accessible 

        o  Can the peer support the AMT-GW functionality locally 

        o  Is MDR supported in the region 

     3.3. NAT 

        Some peers in the overlay may be in anprivate address space and 
        behind firewalls.  We assume that mechanisms are available for the 
        following, and that the mechanisms scale as the ratio of NATed peers 
        to public address (public) peers grows, to a limit. 

        o  Connectivity establishment between NATed peers and public peers 

        o  Routing of overlay control messages to/from NATed and public 
           peers. 

        o  Routing of data messages over the topology of the tree 

        NAT traversal solutions developed elsewhere in IETF will be used, and 
        new NAT traversal mechanisms are out of scope to this framework. 

     3.4. Regions 

        A region is a contiguous internetwork such that if native multicast 
        is available, all routers and end systems can connect to native 
        multicast groups available in that region. 

        A region may include end systems. 

     3.5. AMT 

        We use AMT [THA2006] to connect peers in ALM region with peers in NM 
        region. AMT permits AMT-R and AMT-GW functionality to be embedded in

        hosts or specially configured routers.  We assume AMT-R and AMT-GW 
        can be implemented in peers. 

        AMT has certain restrictions: 1) isolated sites/hosts can receive 
        SSM, 2) isolated non-NAT sites/hosts can send SSM, 3) isolated 
        sites/hosts can receive general multicast.  AMT does not permit 
        isolated sites/hosts to send general multicast.  

     4. ALM Tree Operations 

        Peers use the overlay to support ALM operations such as: 

        o  Create tree 

        o  Join 

        o  Leave 

        o  Re-Form or optimize tree 

        There are a variety of algorithms for peers to form multicast trees 
        in the overlay.  We permit multiple such algorithms to be supported 
        in the overlay, since different algorithms may be more suitable for 
        certain application requirements, and since we wish to support 
        experimentation.  Therefore, overlay messaging corresponding to the 
        set of overlay multicast operations must carry algorithm 
        identification information. 
        For example, for small groups, the join point might be directly 
        assigned by the rendezvous point, while for large trees the join 
        request might be propagated down the tree with candidate parents 
        forwarding their position directly to the new node. 
        In addition to these overlay level tree operations, some peers may 
        implement additional operations to map tree operations to native 
        multicast and/or AMT [THA2006] connections.

     5. Hybrid Connectivity 

        In the above figure we show the hybrid architecture in six regions of 
        the network.  All peers are connected in an overlay, and the figure 
        shows the predecessor/successor links between peers.  The peers may 
        have other connections in the overlay. 
        o  No native multicast:  Peers (P) in this region connect to the 
           overlay

        o  Native multicast (NM) with a local AMT gateway (AMT GW).  There 
           are one or more peers (P) connected to the overlay in this region. 

        o  Native multicast with a local AMT relay (AMT RLY).  There are one 
           or more peers (P) connected to the overlay in this region. 

        o  Native multicast with one or more peers which emulate the AMT 
           relay behavior (P-AMT-R) which also connect to the overlay.  There 
           may be other peers (P) which also connect to the overlay. 

        o  Native MDR is a native multicast region using multi-destination 
           routing, in which one or more peers reside in the region. 

        o  Native multicast with no peers that connect to the overlay, but 
           for which there is at least one peer in the unicast-only part of 
           the network which can behave as an AMT-GW (P-AMT-GW) to connect to 
           multicast sources through an AMT-R for that region.  It may be 
           feasible to also allow non-peer hosts in such a region to 
           participate as receivers of overlay multicast; for this version, 
           we prefer to require all hosts to join the overlay as peers.

        Here is a summary of the Scribe algorithm [CAS2002] for forming a 
        multicast tree in the overlay. Its main advantage is use of the 
        overlay routing mechanism for routing both control and data messages. 
        The group creator doesn’t have to be the root of the tree or even in 
        the tree. It doesn’t consider per node load, admission control, or 
        alternative paths.   

        As stated earlier, multiple algorithms will co-exist in the overlay.   

        1. Peer which initiates multicast group: 

          groupID = create();  // allocate a unique groupId  

                            // the root is the nearest peer in the overlay 

          // out of band advertisement/distribution of groupID, perhaps by 
            publishing in DHT 

        2. Any joining peer: 

          // out of band discovery of groupID, perhaps by lookup in DHT

          joinTree(groupID); // sends “join groupID” message 

          The overlay routes the join request using the overlay routing 
            mechanism toward the peer with the nearest id to the groupID.  
            This peer is the root.  Peers on the path to the root join the 
            tree as forwarding points.  The joining peer is a member of the 
            group. 

        3. Leave Tree:  

           leaveTree(groupID) // removes this node from the tree 

           Propagates a leave message to each child node and to the parent 
            node.  If the parent node is a forwarding node and this is its 
            last child, then it propagates a leave message to its parent.  A 
            child node receiving a leave message from a parent sends a join 
            message to the groupID. 

        4. Message forwarding:  

            multicastMsg(groupID, msg); 

            The sender routes the message to the IP address of the root of 
               the tree, which in turn forwards it after validation down the 
               tree. 

        5. Heartbeat 

            Periodically each parent sends a heartbeat message to its 
               children.  If a child node misses heartbeat messages, tree 
               repair is triggered. 

     6.2. ALM tree with peer at AMT site (AMT-GW)  

        The joining peer connects to the tree using the ALM protocol, or, if 
        the tree includes a peer in an NM region, then the peer can use the 
        AMT GW to connect to the NM peer through the AMT relay. The peer can 
        choose the delivery path based on latency and throughput. 

        If the peer is not a joining peer and is on the overlay path of a 
        join request: 

        o  If its next hop is a peer in an NM region with AMT-R, then it can 
           select either overlay routed multicast messages or AMT delivered 
           multicast messages.

     Internet-Draft    Hybrid Overlay Multicast Framework   January 27, 2007 
         

        o  If its next hop is a peer outside of an NM region, then it could 
           use either ALM only or use AMT delivery as an alternate path 

     6.3. ALM tree with NM peer using AMT-R 

        There are these cases: 

        o  There is no peer in the tree which has an AMT-GW 

            The NM peer uses ALM routing 

        o  There is at least one peer in the tree which can function as P-
           AMT-GW 

            The NM peer can join the tree using ALM routing and/or 
               connecting to the P-AMT-GW. 

        o  There is at least one peer in the tree which is in an AMT-GW 
           region 

            The NM peer can join the tree using ALM routing and/or 
               connecting to the AMT-GW. 

     6.4. ALM tree with NM peer with P-AMT-R 

        Either the NM peer supports P-AMT-R or another peer in the multcast 
        tree in the same region is P-AMT-R capable. 

        The three cases above apply here, replacing AMT-R with P-AMT-R. 

     6.5. Other 

        The next version of this document will elaborate: 

        o  ALM tree topology vs NM topology and NM-ALM edges 

        o  Single NM-ALM edge nodes vs multi NM peers from same region in the 
           tree 

        o  Initial tree membership is ALM vs initial tree membership is NM

     7. Open Issues and Further Work 

        o  AMT [THA2006] has some restrictions on connecting isolated 
           sites/hosts as SSM/ASM sources and receivers.  Further analysis is 
           needed to insure that OM data path is consistent with these 
           constraints and whether additional operating restrictions between 
           the overlay and AMT need be specified. 

        o  For NM regions with no AMT support, specifics of how peers self-
           select as P-AMT-GW and P-AMT-RLY, and what additional behavior if 
           any is needed beyond that specified in [THA2006]. 

        o  We expect that the evolution of this document will lead to 
           protocol specification related to the interopation points of the 
           hybrid interfaces of the network. 

     8. Security Considerations 

        Overlays are vulnerable to DOS and collusion attacks.  We are not 
        solving overlay security issues. 
        For this version we assume centralized peer authentication model 
        similar to what is proposed for P2P-SIP.
