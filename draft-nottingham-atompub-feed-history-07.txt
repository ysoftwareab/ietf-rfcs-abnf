Internet-Draft          Feed Paging and Archiving         September 2006


1.  Introduction

   Syndicated Web feeds (using such formats as Atom [RFC4287] or RSS
   2.0) are often split up into multiple documents to save bandwidth,
   allow "sliding window" access, or for other purposes.

   This specification formalizes two types of feeds that can span one or
   more feed documents; "paged" feeds and "archived" feeds.
   Additionally, it defines "complete" feeds to cover the case when a
   single feed document explicitly represents all of the feed's entries.

   These types are complementary; each has different properties and
   trade-offs:

   o  Complete feeds contain the entire set of entries in one document,
      and can be useful when it isn't desirable to "remember"
      previously-seen entries.
   o  Paged feeds split the logical feed's entries among multiple
      temporary documents.  This can be useful when entries in the feed
      are not long-lived or stable, and the client needs to access an
      arbitrary portion of them, usually in close succession.
   o  Archived feeds split them among multiple permanent documents, and
      can be useful when entries are long-lived and it is important for
      clients to see every one.

   Although they refer to Atom normatively, the mechanisms described
   herein can be used with similar syndication formats, such as the
   various flavors of RSS.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

   "fh": "http://purl.org/syndication/history/1.0"

1.2.  Terminology

   In this specification, "feed document" refers to an Atom Feed
   Document, RSS document, or similar syndication instance document.  It
   may contain any number of entries (in RSS, items), and may or may not
   be a complete representation of the logical feed.

   A "logical feed" is the set of entries associated with a particular
   feed (as contrasted with a feed document, which may contain a subset
   of them).

   "Head section" refers to the children of a feed document's document-
   wide metadata container; e.g., the child elements of the atom:feed
   element in an Atom Feed Document.

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset
   [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a
   shorthand; the phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming
   Element Information Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses
   the term "element," it is referring to an Element Information Item in
   Infoset terms.

   This specification also uses Atom link relations to identify
   different types of links; see the Atom specification [RFC4287] for
   information about their syntax, and the IANA link relation registry
   for more information about specific values.

2.  Complete Feeds

   A complete feed is a feed document that contains all of the entries
   of a logical feed; any entry not actually in the feed document SHOULD
   NOT be considered to be part of that feed.

   For example; a feed that represents a ranking that varies over time,
   such as "Top Twenty Records" or "Most Popular Items" should not have
   newer entries displayed alongside older ones.  By marking them as
   complete feeds, old entries are discarded when the feed is refreshed.

   The fh:complete element, when present in a feed's head section,
   indicates that the feed document it occurs in is a complete
   representation of the logical feed's entries.

   For example,

     <fh:complete/>

3.  Paged Feeds

   A paged feed is a set of linked feed documents that together contain
   the entries of a logical feed, without any guarantees about the
   stability of the documents' contents.

   Paged feeds are lossy; that is, it is not possible to guarantee that
   clients will be able to reconstruct the contents of the logical feed
   at a particular time.  Some entries may be added or changed as the
   pages of the feed are accessed, without the client becoming aware of
   them.

   Paged feeds can be useful when the number of entries is very large,
   infinite, or indeterminate.  Clients can "page" through the feed,
   only accessing a subset of the feed's entries as necessary.

   For example, a search engine might make query results available as a
   paged feed, so that queries with very large result sets do not
   overwhelm the server, the network, or the client.

Internet-Draft          Feed Paging and Archiving         September 2006


   The feed documents in a paged feed are tied together with the
   following link relations:

   o  "first" - A URI that refers to the furthest preceding document in
      a series of documents.
   o  "last" - A URI that refers to the furthest following document in a
      series of documents.
   o  "previous" - A URI that refers to the immediately preceding
      document in a series of documents.
   o  "next" - A URI that refers to the immediately following document
      in a series of documents.

   Paged feed documents MUST have at least one of these link relations
   present, and SHOULD contain as many as practical and applicable.

   Note that URI references in link relation values may be relative, and
   when they are used they must be absolutised, as described in Section
   5.1 of [RFC3986].

4.  Archived Feeds

   An archived feed is a set of feed documents that can be combined to
   accurately reconstruct the entries of a logical feed.

   Unlike paged feeds, archived feeds enable clients to do this without
   losing any entries.  This is achieved by publishing a single
   subscription document and (potentially) many archive documents.

   A subscription document is a feed document that always contains the
   most recently added or changed entries available in the logical feed
   (often, the feed document that should be subscribed to).

   Archive documents are feed documents that contain less recent entries
   in the feed.  The set of entries contained in an archive document
   published at a particular URI SHOULD NOT change over time.  Likewise,



Nottingham               Expires March 16, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Feed Paging and Archiving         September 2006


   the URI for a particular archive document SHOULD NOT change over
   time.

   These stability requirements allow clients to safely assume that if
   they have retrieved an archive document from a particular URI once,
   it will not meaningfully change in the future.  As a result, if an
   archive document's contents are changed, clients may not become aware
   of it.

   Therefore, if a publisher requires a change to be visible to all
   users (e.g., correcting factual errors), they should consider
   publishing the revised entry in the subscription feed, in addition to
   (or instead of) the appropriate archive feed.  Conversely,
   unimportant changes (e.g., spelling corrections) might be only
   effected in archive feeds.

   Typically, a subscription feed will link to a set of archive
   documents (also linked together) which contain progressively less
   recent entries.

   Clients can then "subscribe" to the feed, polling the subscription
   document for recent changes.  If a client has missed some entries,
   the archives can be used to synchronise its state by fetching the
   archive documents it has not yet seen.

   The following link relations are used to tie subscription and
   archived feeds together:

   o  "prev-archive" - A URI that refers to the immediately preceding
      archive document.
   o  "next-archive" - A URI that refers to the immediately following
      archive document.
   o  "current" - A URI that, when dereferenced, returns a feed document
      containing the most recent entries in the feed.

   Subscription documents and archive documents MUST have a "prev-
   archive" link relation, unless there are no archives available.

   Archive documents SHOULD have "next-archive" and "current" link
   relations.

   Note that URI references in link relation values may be relative, and
   when they are used they must be absolutised, as described in Section
   5.1 of [RFC3986].

   Archive document SHOULD also contain an fh:archive element in their
   head sections, to indicate that they are archives.

Internet-Draft          Feed Paging and Archiving         September 2006


   For example,

     <fh:archive/>

   Publishers are not required to make all archive documents available;
   they may refuse to serve (e.g., with HTTP status code 403 or 410), or
   be unable to serve (e.g., with HTTP status code 404) an archive
   document.

   Clients SHOULD warn users when they are not able to reconstruct the
   complete, logical feed (e.g., by alerting the user that an archive
   document is unavailable, or displaying pseudo-entries that inform the
   user that some entries may be missing).

      <description>Before man travels to Mars, NASA hopes to
      design new engines that will let us fly through the Solar
      System more quickly.  The proposed VASIMR engine would do
      that.</description>

5.  IANA Considerations

   The "previous", "next" and "current" link relations have been
   previously registered, and no IANA action regarding them is required.

   This specification defines the following link relations:

      o  Attribute Value: prev-archive
      o  Description: A URI that refers to the immediately
         preceding archive document.
      o  Expected display characteristics: none
      o  Security considerations: See [ this document ]

      o  Attribute Value: next-archive
      o  Description: A URI that refers to the immediately
         following archive document.
      o  Expected display characteristics: none
      o  Security considerations: See [ this document ]

6.  Security Considerations

   Feeds using the mechanisms described here could be crafted in such a
   way as to cause a client to initiate excessive (or even an unending
   sequence of) network requests, causing denial of service (either to
   the client, the target server, and/or intervening networks).  Clients
   can mitigate this risk by requiring user intervention after a certain
   number of requests, or by limiting requests either according to a
   hard limit, or with heuristics.

   Clients should be mindful of resource limits when storing feed
   documents.  To reiterate, they are not required to always store or
   reconstruct the feed when conforming to this specification; they only
   need inform the user when the reconstructed feed is not complete.

Appendix B.  Reconstructing Archived Feeds

   One algorithm for reconstructing an archived feed into a complete,
   logical feed (S), give the subscription document (D) follows.

   1.  Create an empty list L.
   2.  Consider the URI of the last archive document successfully stored
       to local store S as A.
   3.  Consider the set of entries in document D as E.
   4.  If the document D has a "prev-archive" link relation value P in
       its head section, and P is not A,
       1.  Append P to L.
       2.  Dereference P and use the resulting feed document as D.
   5.  Repeat the previous step until no new P is found.
   6.  Add all of document D's entries to the local store S, replacing
       any entries with the same identity.
   7.  Pop the last "prev-archive" link relation from L, dereference its
       value and use the resulting feed document as D.
   8.  Repeat the previous two steps until L is empty.
   9.  Add the entries E to the local store S, replacing any entries
       with the same identity.

   In these instructions, the concept of an entry's identity is format-
   specific; e.g., in Atom, it is conveyed by the atom:id element; in
   RSS 2, it is indicated by the guid element.
