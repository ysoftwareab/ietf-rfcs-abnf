                LISP Mapping Service Discovery at Large
                draft-boucadair-lisp-idr-ms-discovery-00

Abstract

   Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) operation relies upon a mapping
   mechanism that is used by ingress/egress Tunnel Routers (xTR) to
   forward traffic over the LISP network.  The ability of dynamically
   discovering the Map-Resolver and Map-Server entities that provide
   such mapping services is meant to facilitate global LISP operation
   (automatic discovery of Map-Resolvers and Map-Servers).

   This document specifies a BGP Extended Communities attribute that can
   be used to dynamically discover LISP Mappig Systems of different
   domains.

1.  Introduction

   Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP, [RFC6830] ) operation relies
   upon a mapping mechanism that is used by ingress/egress Tunnel
   Routers (xTR) to forward traffic over the LISP network.  The ability
   of dynamically discovering the Map-Resolver and Map-Server entities
   that provide such mapping services is meant to facilitate global LISP
   operation (automatic discovery of Map-Resolvers and Map-Servers).

   Within this document, a Mapping System provides the LISP Mapping
   service [RFC6833].  Map-Resolvers, Map-Servers, and other components
   may be part of a Mapping System such as authorization, subscription
   profiles, etc.  These components are considered as black boxes; only
   the external behavior of the Mapping System is in scope.

   Distinct LISP mapping systems may emerge if LISP users or network
   operators who solicit or manage the mapping system want to avoid some
   region-centric systems, for example, or if they want to position
   themselves as a core provider of the Mapping System.  The lack of

   clear policies of the management and operation of the LISP Mapping
   Systems may encourage such practices.

   Also, this document assumes a hierarchy in the Mapping System
   organisation for business, governance, control, and regulatory
   purposes in particular.  In such contexts, the document assumes that
   a Mapping System may maintain a portion of or a global mapping table.

   Because of its experimental nature the LISP protocol and the various
   platforms LISP operation relies upon (like the platforms used by the
   LISP mapping systems) should encourage innovation by testing new
   services that may take advantage of LISP in inter-domain deployment
   scenarios without requiring the participation of all LISP-enabled
   domains.  Such approach is also meant to avoid any risk of freezing
   LISP developments.

   Because the design and operation of a consistent LISP mapping system
   is critical for the adoption of the protocol at large scale, this
   document advocates for means to dynamically discover other Mapping
   Systems that are open to cooperate in inter-domain LISP deployment
   scenarios, typically .

   Deploying LISP for inter-domain use cases may raise the following
   issues:

   Issue#1:   A LISP domain may need to discover available mapping
      systems so that it can rely upon those mapping systems to extend
      the reachability scope.

   Issue#2:   Various Mapping Systems can be deployed over the Internet.
      These Mapping Systems need to interconnect to extend the
      reachability scope and avoid pressure on PTR (Proxy Tunnel Router)
      devices.  Also, various mapping systems encourage the enforcement
      of policies that aim at optimizing LISP forwarding: for example,
      policies that consist in avoiding the solicitation of specific
      domains.

   Issue#3:   Distinct flavors of Mapping Systems may be deployed.
      These mappings may not rely on the same database mapping system
      (e.g., NERD, ALT, CONS, etc.).  As such, a clear interface to ease
      interconnection between these realms is needed.  Standard
      solutions to discover Mapping Systems capabilities are likely to
      ease the interconnection of Mapping Systems.

   Issue#4:   Security concerns may arise during the discovery of the
      available Mapping Systems: for example, a given Mapping System may
      deny access from another domain, or available Mapping Systems need
      to make sure that they are entitled to exchange information with

      one another or that an xTR of a given LISP network is entitled to
      solicit a mpping system of another LISP network, etc.

   The global objective of this effort is to encourage the deployment
   and the operation of a global Mapping System at the scale of the
   Internet instead of a fragmented mapping system.

   This document relies on extended BGP communities [RFC4360] to
   advertise that a given domain supports the LISP Mapping Service.  A
   contact IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address are also included in the
   attribute so that remote LISP Mapping Systems or LISP domains may
   initiate negotiation cycles for the sake of LISP Mapping System
   Interconnection or subscription to the Mapping Service offered by
   that Mapping System.

2.  Rationale

   This document focuses on the discovery of LISP Mapping Systems that
   are deployed in distinct administrative domains.

   The rationale is as follows:

   1.  Announce: Domains that support a LISP Mapping Service will use
       the BGP Extended Communities attribute to inform other domains
       about the support of the service.  EIDs that can be serviced with
       LISP can be tagged accordingly.  Note that an EID can be serviced
       by multiple Mapping Systems.

   2.  Discover: Remote LISP Mapping Systems will rely upon that BGP-
       based advertising capability to discover the existence of other
       Mapping Systems.

   3.  Negotiate/Interconnect/Invoke: The contact IP address provided as
       part of the BGP Extended Communities attribute will be used to
       contact a remote Mapping System to request for further LISP-
       related capabilities, possibly negotiate an interconnection
       agreement and, consequently, extend the scope of the networks
       that can be serviced using LISP.

   4.  Negotiate/Subscribe/Invoke: Also, leaf LISP-aware networks can
       rely upon the information carried in the BGP Extended Communities
       attribute to discover Mapping Systems that may be solicited to
       invoke their mapping service.  Subscription cycles may then be
       considered.

   Only the first two steps are in scope of this document; the remaining
   steps can be achieved by other means such as
   [I-D.boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-protocol].

3.  LISP Mapping System Target BGP Extended Community

   The LISP Mapping System Target Community identifies one or more
   Mapping System contact points that can receive mapping system
   interconnect and/or subscription requests.  These contact points are
   identified with IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.

   The LISP Mapping System Target Community is of an extended type.  As
   such, the behavior specified in section 6 of [RFC4360] applies to the
   LISP Mapping System Target Community.

   The presence of this community is an explicit indication that
   associated networks can be managed by a LISP Mapping System that is
   reachable at the addresses carried in the attribute.

   This document reuses the Transitive IPv4-Address-Specific Extended
   Community [RFC4360] and Transitive IPv6-Address-Specific Extended
   Community [RFC5701] for the purpose of this document.  Dedicated sub-
   types are to be allocated (see Section 5).

   The Global Administrator field MUST be set to an IP address of the
   Mapping System.  This address MUST be configured on the originating
   BGP speaker.

   The "Local Administrator" field of the LISP Mapping System Target
   Community is used to encode an identifier of the Mapping System.
   Considerations about the assignment of globally unique identifiers to
   LISP Mapping Systems are out of scope.  A configurable parameter may
   be supported by BGP implementations to provide the value carried in
   the "Local Administrator" field.  If no identifier is configured on
   the originating BGP speaker, the "Local Administrator" field MUST be
   set to 0.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC4360][RFC5701].

5.  IANA Considerations

   According to [RFC7153], this document requests the assignment of a
   sub-type in the "0x00-0xbf" range from the Transitive IPv4-Address-
   Specific Extended Community Sub-Types registry available at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities/bgp-
