INTERNET DRAFT      PBB-EVPN with Anycast IP Tunnels    October 19, 2015


1  Introduction

   RFC7623 defines PBB-EVPN, a solution that provides scalable MPLS
   Layer 2 VPN services using multi-protocol BGP combined with Provider
   Backbone Bridging (PBB) [802.1ah]. 

   In this document, we describe a solution that uses PBB-EVPN to
   aggregate IP access networks over an MPLS backbone, while offering
   Layer 2 VPN services end to end. The network topology in question
   comprises of three domains: the customer network, the IP access
   network and the MPLS backbone, as shown in the figure below.

                            +--------------+    

   Figure 1: Target Topology

   The customer network connects via Customer Edge (CE) devices to the
   IP Access Network. The IP Access Network includes Access Nodes (ANs)
   and IP core nodes (IPc). The ANs perform tunneling of Ethernet
   packets using some IP tunneling mechanism (e.g. GRE or VXLAN). The
   MPLS Backbone comprises of PBB-EVPN PEs as well as MPLS core nodes
   (P). The PBB-EVPN PEs terminate the IP tunnels which originate from
   the ANs in their local IP Access Network.

   To simplify the operations and reduce the provisioning overhead on
   the ANs, as well as to provide resiliency, the PEs will use Anycast
   IP addresses as the tunnel destination, for tunnels originating from
   the ANs. We will refer to this setup as PBB-EVPN with Anycast IP
   tunnels.

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Requirements

   The solution MUST support multipoint Layer 2 VPN services end to end
   (i.e. CE to CE), with the following requirements:

   - Support for IP as well as non-IP payloads. Hence, the solution
   should not rely on any ARP or ND snooping mechanism, but rather rely
   on MAC learning in data-plane.

   - Use IP as the underlying transport in the access network, with
   support for IPv6.

   - Support VLAN multiplexing with Customer VLAN (C-Tag) transparency
   in the IP tunnels.

   - Support for VLAN aware service bundling over the IP tunnels on the
   PBB-EVPN PEs. This means that the PE needs to identify the L2 Bridge
   Domain based on the combination of the IP tunnel identifier AND the
   C-Tag (and/or S-tag).

   - Support for local switching between IP tunnels on the PBB-EVPN PEs.
   This is due to the assumption that the ANs may not support any local
   switching/bridging functionality between their access ports.

   - Support for hierarchical QoS with two levels in the hierarchy: per
   IP tunnel and per C-Tag (and/or S-tag).

   - Provide resilient interconnect with protection against: PE node
   failure, path failures in the IP access network, and IP tunnel
   failure.

   - Simplify the provisioning of the ANs by using Anycast IP addresses
   as the tunnel destination on the PEs. This eliminates the need to
   explicitly provisioning the ANs with the unicast IP addresses of the
   redundant PEs.

3 Current Challenges with PBB-EVPN

   PBB-EVPN currently can operate in two different redundancy modes:
   All-Active redundancy and Single-Active redundancy. Neither of these
   modes can satisfy the requirements set forth in section 2 above. We
   will discuss this in detail in this section.

3.1 All-Active Redundancy Mode

 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 19, 2016                 [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT      PBB-EVPN with Anycast IP Tunnels    October 19, 2015


   The challenge with the All-Active redundancy mode is that the traffic
   arriving from the MPLS backbone get load-balanced among the PEs in
   the redundancy group. As such, it is not possible to enforce the QoS
   policies reliably for traffic in the backbone to access direction.
   Note that one cannot assume that the traffic will get distributed
   evenly between the PEs due to the possibility of "elephant" flows
   (i.e. flows with considerable bandwidth demands), especially when
   load-balancing algorithms on the PEs do not take bandwidth into
   account in the hashing decision. 

3.2 Single-Active Redundancy Mode

   The challenge with the Single-Active redundancy mode is that, based
   on the DF election, only one of the PBB-EVPN PEs will be forwarding
   traffic from access to the backbone. At the same time, depending on
   the IGP distance between the Access Node (AN), and the PEs, traffic
   over the Anycast IP tunnel may be delivered to the non-DF PE, where
   it is permanently dropped. This is because the DF election
   procedures, which are triggered by BGP exchanges, are independent of
   the IGP path calculations.

   Relaxing the DF filtering rules will result in duplicate packets, and
   hence is not an option.

4 Solution

4.1 Overview

   The solution involves defining a new asymmetric redundancy scheme for
   PBB-EVPN, which behaves similar to All-Active redundancy for traffic
   destined to the MPLS backbone from the Ethernet Segment and behaves
   similar to Single-Active redundancy for traffic destined to the
   Ethernet Segment from the MPLS backbone.

   Since the mechanism behaves like All-Active redundancy for traffic
   destined towards the MPLS backbone, the PEs in the redundancy group
   can all receive traffic from the ANs, irrespective of how the IGP
   steers the Anycast traffic. The segment split horizon filtering on
   the PE prevents looping of BUM traffic.

   Moreover, since the mechanism behaves like Single-Active redundancy
   for traffic destined towards the Ethernet Segment, the active PE can
   reliably enforce the QoS policies.

4.2 Operation

   Each IP tunnel will be treated as a virtual Ethernet Segment (vES)
   [Virtual-ES] on the PBB-EVPN PEs. However, instead of having a single

   B-MAC address associated with each vES across all PEs in the RG, each
   PE will assign a different B-MAC for each vES, because Single-Active
   redundancy is used for traffic from the MPLS backbone. This ensures
   that remote PEs learn the C-MAC addresses against the unique B-MAC of
   the active PE only. Note that the active PE here is actually
   determined based on where the Anycast traffic lands, according the
   IGP distance between the ANs and the PEs in the IP access network.

   Traffic filtering based on DF election applies only to BUM traffic,
   and only for traffic in the direction towards the Ethernet Segment.

   Figure 2: Example Network

   For what follows, please refer to the example network in Figure 2
   above.

4.2.1 Known Unicast Traffic

   When an access nodes (e.g. AN1) forwards known unicast traffic over
   the IP access network, the traffic will be steered towards one of the
   PEs depending on the IGP distance between the AN and the PEs. In the
   case where both PEs are equidistant from the AN, i.e. ECMP, the load-
   balancing hash on the AN and IP core nodes of the access network
   determines which PE receives the traffic. Assume the traffic is
   delivered to PE1 in this example. PE1 would then encapsulate the
   traffic in the PBB header, using its B-MAC address that is associated
   with the vES corresponding to the IP tunnel on which the traffic was
   received. The PE then adds the MPLS encapsulation and forwards the
   packets towards the destination remote PE (PEr in this example). PEr
   would then learn the C-MAC against the B-MAC address associated with
   PE1. Hence, for the reverse traffic PEr will forward the traffic
   destined to that C-MAC to PE1. This follows normal PBB-EVPN
   operation.

INTERNET DRAFT      PBB-EVPN with Anycast IP Tunnels    October 19, 2015


   The only issue to consider is how would the PEs enforce the QoS
   policies in case of the presence of multiple equal cost paths between
   the AN and the PEs. Since the QoS policies need to be enforced per IP
   tunnel and per C-Tag (and/or S-tag) on the PE, the AN needs to ensure
   that all traffic of a given tunnel lands on the same PE. This can be
   done by encoding the tunnel identifier in the entropy field of the
   packet. For example, in the case of VXLAN, the source VTEP address
   can be hashed into the source UDP port. Similarly, in the case of
   GRE, the source tunnel address can be hashed into the GRE key. This
   guarantees that all traffic associated with a given IP tunnel from an
   AN is destined to a single PE, even in the presence of ECMP.

4.2.2 BUM Traffic

   The PEs in a redundancy group perform the standard DF election
   procedures described in RFC7623 (i.e. with per I-SID load-balancing).
   As a result, only one of the PEs will be responsible for forwarding
   BUM traffic received from the MPLS backbone towards the Ethernet
   Segment (i.e. IP access network). This is per standard PBB-EVPN
   operation.

   For BUM traffic from the IP access network destined towards the MPLS
   backbone, the traffic will be sent as a unicast from the AN to one of
   the PEs (depending on the IGP distance, or the ECMP hash in case of
   equidistant PEs). This is because the AN does not support any
   bridging function. The ingress PE, which receives the BUM traffic,
   will flood it following the standard procedures of PBB-EVPN. This
   includes applying any DF filtering on locally attached Ethernet
   Segments. For example, assume that for a given I-SID (ISID1), PE1 is
   the DF for the vES associated with the IP tunnel to AN1, whereas PE2
   is the DF for the vES associated with the IP tunnel to AN2. For BUM
   traffic sent by AN1 to PE1, the PE1 will not flood the traffic
   towards AN2 since this PE is not the DF for that vES.

   The ingress PE would flood the BUM traffic to other PEs in the
   redundancy group. In our example, this means that PE1 will flood the
   BUM traffic to PE2. These PEs need to apply the segment split-horizon
   filtering function to guarantee that the BUM traffic does not loop
   back into the originating AN. To achieve this, a new procedure is
   added to standard PBB-EVPN whereby the PE examines the source B-MAC
   address on the BUM traffic, and recognizes that this B-MAC is
   associated with a local vES. As such, the PE does not flood the BUM
   traffic over that specific vES. This is effectively an extension of
   the PBB-EVPN split-horizon functionality: in the standard, a single
   B-MAC is associated with a given ESI, whereas here multiple B-MACs
   are associated with the same ESI. Note that the PE would forward the
   BUM traffic on other virtual Ethernet Segments in the same bridge
   domain, and for which it is the assigned DF. Going back to our
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 19, 2016                 [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT      PBB-EVPN with Anycast IP Tunnels    October 19, 2015


   example, PE2 in this case would forward the BUM traffic received from
   PE1 towards AN2 but not towards AN1.

4.3 Optimizing PE B-MAC Address Allocation

   The mechanisms described thus far require the allocation of a B-MAC
   address per IP tunnel (i.e. per CE). For high-scale deployments, this
   allocation scheme defeats the scaling benefits of PBB-EVPN. Hence, a
   more optimal B-MAC address allocation mechanism is needed. This
   section describes how this can be achieved.

   In order to reduce the number of B-MAC addresses required per PE, the
   approach is to adopt the "local bias" mechanism defined in [Overlay]
   for PBB-EVPN. This allows only a single B-MAC address to be assigned
   to each PE for all its vES's (instead of one B-MAC per vES). 

4.3.1 Known Unicast Traffic

   The operation for known unicast traffic is similar to what was
   described in section 4.2.1, albeit with a single source B-MAC address
   being used for all traffic arriving at the PE from the virtual
   Ethernet Segments associated with the IP tunnels.

4.3.2 BUM Traffic

   The operation for BUM traffic can be broken down to three different
   scenarios, as discussed next.

4.3.2.1 BUM Traffic from Ethernet Segment

   For BUM traffic arriving from the (virtual) Ethernet Segment, the PE
   follows the local bias mechanisms. That is, it floods the traffic
   over all other local (virtual) Ethernet Segments in the same bridge-
   domain irrespective of DF election state. The PE also floods the
   traffic over the MPLS backbone.

4.3.2.2 BUM Traffic from PE in Redundancy Group

   For BUM traffic arriving from another ingress PE in the same
   Redundancy Group, the PE inspects the source B-MAC address in the
   packets to identify the right replication list for the I-SID in
   question. This replication list would exclude all (virtual) Ethernet
   Segments that are common with the ingress PE (to prevent loops). The
   PE would flood the BUM traffic over all (virtual) Ethernet Segments
   in that specific replication list, subject to the DF filtering
   constraints - i.e., it is the DF for that segment.

4.3.2.3 BUM Traffic from Remote PE
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 19, 2016                 [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT      PBB-EVPN with Anycast IP Tunnels    October 19, 2015


   For BUM traffic arriving from a remote ingress PE that has no
   segments in common with the egress PE, the latter would again examine
   the source B-MAC address in the packets to identify the replication
   list for the I-SID in question. This replication list would include
   all (virtual) Ethernet Segments that are in the associated bridge-
   domain. The PE would flood the traffic over all those segments while
   observing the DF filtering rules.

5 Failure Scenarios

   In this section we will discuss the operation of the solution in case
   of various failure scenarios.

5.1 Link/Node Failure in Access Network

   For link or node failures in the access network, which do not cause
   the ANs to completely lose connectivity to the PEs, the failure will
   trigger the IGP to recalculate the shortest path. This may cause the
   Anycast traffic from some ANs to be steered towards new PEs. However,
   no action will be required in the control plane on the PEs. Remote
   PEs will automatically update their C-MAC/B-MAC associations through
   data-plane learning. There are no transient loops, and the
   convergence time is a function of how quickly the IGP can re-
   converge.

5.2 PE Node Failure

   Failure of the PE node is addressed by the fact that the IP tunnels
   use Anycast addresses. The ANs do not need to explicitly react to the
   failure in any special way, as the IGP re-convergence takes care of
   the fail-over procedures. The B-MAC routes advertised by the failed
   PE are withdrawn by the Route Reflector, which in turn flushes all
   the C-MACs associated with those B-MACs on the remote PEs. If this
   happens before any new traffic arrives from the CE via the new PE,
   temporary flooding would occur as expected. However, as soon as those
   remote PEs start receiving traffic from the associated C-MACs over
   the new PE, the remote PEs will update their C-MAC/B-MAC bindings
   through normal data-plane learning. 

5.3 IP Tunnel Failure

   IP tunnel failure occurs when there is no viable path, within the
   access network, between the AN and a PE. The PE can detect such
   condition by using IGP route watch mechanisms. Upon detecting this
   failure, the PE reacts with two actions:

   - It withdraws all the MAC Advertisement routes associated with the
   B-MAC(s) of the affected vES's.

   Similar to the PE node failure scenario above, this may result in
   temporary flooding from remote PEs until traffic starts flowing in
   the other direction from the CEs.  

5.4 AN Node Failure

   From the perspective of the PE, this failure is handled the same way
   as the IP tunnel failure scenario. If the CE connected to the failed
   AN is single-homed, then no redundancy would be available.

6  Security Considerations

   There are no special security considerations beyond those of PBB-
   EVPN.


7  IANA Considerations

   TBD
