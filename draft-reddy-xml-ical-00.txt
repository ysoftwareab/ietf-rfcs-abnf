          Abstract  

          The motivation for this proposal is the expanded scope and 
          diversity of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web provides a 
          simple and effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve, 
          and publish information of their own available for others. Now 
          that Web browsers and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet, it 
          is worthwhile to use XML to encode calendar objects. The power 
          and extensibility of XML allows us to represent calendar data 
          objects as well-formed XML documents. 

          ICAL is an existing standard format for representing calendar 
          components. This draft explains how to represent calendar 
          components in XML that are compatible and easily translatable to 
          the iCAL format.

       2. Introduction 

       2.1.Problem to be solved 

       2.1.1.  Handheld and other thin clients  

          Thin clients, such as handheld computers, have many restrictions 
          on how much software can be loaded.  Since XML is a standard 
          format used by many other applications such as web browsers, 
          using XML will lead to smaller footprints to implement 
          calendaring on thin clients.  

       2.1.2.  Interoperability 

          The XML format allows calendar data to be used by many 
          applications.  The format will be more widely used if it can be 
          interpreted by general-purpose clients such as web browsers. 

       2.2.Overview  

       2.3.Solution Requirements 

          The XML format must be easily convertible to and from the 
          original iCAL format. 

          To be resolved: How does a client send an XML-iCAL component over 
          iMIP/iTIP? 

          To be resolved: How does a client indicate to another client over 
          iMIP/iTIP which format it prefers? 

       2.4.Terminology 

          In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
          "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
          "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 
          2119 [2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant RVP 
          implementations.

       2.5.Definitions 

          Component 

          A component is a vcalendar, vtodo, valarm, or other iCAL 
          component, which may be expressed in either original iCAL or 
          proposed XML-iCAL format.  The component should express identical 
          semantics in either format. 

       3. Why XML  

          XML is a public format based on SGML to allow the design of new 
          document types for applications such as calendaring.  The v1.0 
          specification [XML] was accepted by the W3C as a Recommendation 
          on Feb 10, 1998.  

       3.1.Extensible 

          XML is designed to be extensible.  Clients can ignore tags which 
          they do not understand.   

       3.1.1.  Document Type Definition 

          XML allows a DTD (Document Type Definition) to be sent along with 
          the XML data.  This allows clients to interpret data in 
          previously unknown formats.  So if a vendor decides to extend the 
          iCalendar XML format, it can include the DTD for 
          interoperability. 

          However, DTDs are optional in XML bodies.  That means that for 
          calendaring applications, we can define a standard format for the 
          basic calendaring data and not include the DTD in every ordinary 
          component.   

       3.1.2.  Namespaces 

          XML uses namespaces to distinguish between elements that may have 
          the same name but for different purposes.  This allows XML 
          formats to be very extensible:  newly defined elements can be 
          assigned to namespaces which distinguish them from old elements 
          of the same name.  The XML namespaces draft is in W3C last call 
          currently and is a mature draft. 

          This hypothetical example shows how "Foo Enterprises" could 
          extend the namespace for their custom calendar store, to allow 
          events to have ratings: 

             <C:vevent xmlns:C="urn:schemas:ical:">  
               <C:dtstart DCD:dt="dateTime.tz">1997-11-02T18:00</C:dtstart> 
               <C:summary>Interview with Robert Dusseault</C:summary>  
               <F:rating xmlns:F="http://schemas.foo.com/TV"> 
                 PG-13</F:rating> 
             </C:vevent>

          Internet-Draft             iCAL in XML            November 18, 1998 

          Clients which are not familiar with the rating element can still 
          understand the vevent component.   

          It is also possible to redefine an element with the same name.  
          For example, a future enhancement to calendar item formats might 
          redefine start time to allow a range of possible start times: 

             <C:vevent xmlns:C="urn:schemas:ical:">  
               <C2:dtstart xmlns:C2="urn:schemas:ical2:"       
                           DCD:dt="dateTime.tz"> 
                 <C2:begin>1997-11-02T18:00</C2:begin> 
                 <C2:end>1997-11-02T18:02</C2:end> 
               </C2:dtstart> 
               ... 
             </C:vevent> 
              

          With the namespace clearly defined for new element styles, an old 
          client can ignore the element if it doesn't understand the new 
          format. 

          It is possible to define a default namespace for an XML document, 
          which means that the prefix isn't required for all elements.  The 
          example above could be rewritten to avoid prefixes for the 
          default namespace, as follows: 

             <vevent xmlns="urn:schemas:ical:">  
               <dtstart DCD:dt="dateTime.tz">1997-11-02T18:00</dtstart> 
               <summary>Interview with Robert Dusseault</summary>  
               <F:rating xmlns:F="http://schemas.foo.com/TV"> 
                 PG-13</F:rating> 
             </vevent> 
              
          Note that the namespace prefix is still present for non-default 
          namespaces such as DCD and the imaginary TV ratings schema.  In 
          the rest of this document, default namespaces will be used for 
          brevity, although both are equally understood by XML parsers that 
          support namespaces. 

       3.2.De-coupled from UI and from storage format 

          XML was designed to be de-coupled from how information is stored, 
          and also from how information is displayed.  It's the information 
          "middleman" format.  Data in all sorts of storage formats can be 
          easily converted to XML, and XML can be easily displayed by 
          special-purpose or general-purpose clients. 

       3.3.Lightweight 

          XML parsers are lightweight.  The XML format can also be used for 
          many different kinds of data.  Standardizing on one kind of data 
          format rather than many reduces the requirements for clients.

          Portable devices in particular can benefit from lightweight data 
          formats. 

          The XML format results in lengthy data markup documents, but 
          lends itself nicely to existing compression scheme. 

       3.4.Searchable 

          XML was designed to be searchable.  It enables searching for 
          documents "by a person named Winston Churchill" rather than 
          "containing the string Winston Churchill". 

       3.5.Working with XML and original iCAL format 

       3.5.1.  Conversion 

          XML formats can be converted quite simply to and from iCAL 
          formats. 

          This format was designed such that conversion to and from XML-
          iCAL and original iCAL formats would be simple and preserve all 
          information.   

       3.5.2.  Supporting both XML-iCAL and original iCAL formats 

          With MIME multipart documents, it is possible to include both 
          formats.   

          For a server that supports both formats and can convert between 
          the two, SCAP allows clients to specify which format they prefer. 

       3.6.Related standards 

          XML works nicely with other standards, such as ISO 8601 data 
          formats. 

       3.6.1.  ISO 8601 extended data time formats 

          XML DCDs have already defined a data type for ISO 8601 date time 
          format (see below).   

          Because the data typing is extensible, other date/time formats 
          may also be defined and standardized. 

       3.7.Using data types 

          XML data types provide an extensible way of specifying how to 
          interpret data.   

          Example: 

          <dtend DCD:dt="dateTime.tz">2088-04-07T18:39:09-08:00</dtend> 

          This example shows the dtend expressed in ISO8601 date/time 
          format with optional timezone offset.

          Data types can also be an integral part of the element 
          definition, so that the data type may default to a particular 
          type, or may be restricted to a particular type as in this 
          example definition: 

             <!ELEMENT dtend (#PCDATA)> 
             <!ATTLIST dtend dt:dt CDATA #FIXED "dateTime.tz"> 
              
          For more information on data types, see [DCD]. 

       3.8.Internationalization 

       3.8.1.  Language support 

          XML has built-in support for specifying the language of text 
          elements [XML].  The xml:lang attribute may be inserted to 
          specify the language of an element which contains text.  The 
          value of the xml:lang attribute is a case-insensitive language 
          identifier such as "en" for English, or "en-GB" for British 
          English. 

          Example: 

             <summary xml:lang="en-GB">Choose colours for 
             packaging</summary> 
             <summary xml:lang="en-US">Choose colors for 
             packaging</summary> 
              
          It is not necessary to put the xml:lang attribute on every 
          string: the xml:lang attribute can be put on a container 
          component to apply to every sub-component except noted exceptions 
          (see example for vcalendar, section 5.1). 

       3.8.2.  Encoding support 

          XML bodies can be marked with a particular type of encoding, for 
          example: 

             <?xml encoding='UTF-8'?> 
              
       3.9.Security 

       3.9.1.  Encryption 

          There are existing ways of encrypting XML. 

       4. Details on use of XML 

          Note that XML is case sensitive.  

       4.1.Namespace 

          The namespace for all iCAL elements in XML will be 
          "urn:schemas:ical:"

          Internet-Draft             iCAL in XML            November 18, 1998 

       4.2.Date/time format 

          Recommend use of ISO 8601 extended format for date/time data.  
          This should be fairly easy to convert to iCAL (which uses the ISO 
          non-extended format), and would result in simpler XML formatting.  
          This is also defined for use by [DCD], which allows an individual 
          element's data type to be defined. 

          Examples: 

          <dtstart DCD:dt="dateTime.tz">1998-09-09T18:30-08:00</dtstart> 

          <dtstart DCD:dt="dateTime.tz">1998-09-09</dtstart> 

          <dtstart DCD:dt="dateTime">1998-09-09</dtstart> 

          <dtstart DCD:dt="date">1998-09-09</dtstart> 

          These are all valid because in "dateTime.tz" the time and 
          timezone are optional, and in dateTime the time is optional. 

          Recommend use of ISO 8601 extended format also for "duration", 
          which is defined in [DCD] as the "interval" data type. 

       4.3.Lists of things 

          In this document, rather than have multiple ways of doing lists 
          of things (comma-separated values of one property, vs. several 
          properties), the <li> or "list" element (standard to HTML) is 
          used as a list delimiter.  The value of the data within the <li> 
          element depends on the container outside the <li> element.  For 
          example, for the "categories" element the contents of each list 
          element is a string.  

             <categories> 
               <li>XML project<li> 
               <li>Calendaring<li> 
             </categories> 
              
          The <li> element may be omitted when there is only one item in 
          the list. 

          When there are multiple elements such as multiple locations, this 
          means the extras are alternates, NOT a list.  E.g.  

             <location xml:lang="en">Germany</location 
             <location xml:lang="no">Tyskland</location>

       5. Calendar Component Elements 

       5.1.Calendar Message     

          Calendar messages are [XML] documents that are sent between SCAP    
          client and server. The XML definition of a Calendar message is as    
          follows:     

          <!ELEMENT vcalendar (prodid, (vevent | vtodo | vjournal | 
                        vfreebusy | vtimezone )+)>

             </vcalendar> 
              
       5.2.vevent XML element     

          Name:         vevent     

          Purpose:      Provide a grouping of component properties that 
                        describe an event.     

          Description:  A vevent XML element is a grouping of component 
                        properties and an OPTIONAL 'valarm' XML element 
                        that represent a scheduled amount of time on a 
                        calendar.  

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT vevent (attach*, attendee*, categories*, 
                        class?, comment*, contact*, created?, description?,

       5.2.1.  Example: Opaque vevent 

          The following is an example of the 'vevent' calendar component 
          used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to searches 
          for busy time:

          The following is an example of the 'vevent' calendar component 
          used to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather    
          transparent, to searches for busy time:

          The following is an example of the "vevent" calendar component 
          used to represent an anniversary that will occur annually. Since 
          it takes  up no time, it will not appear as opaque in a search 
          for busy time; no matter what the value of the "transp" property 
          indicates:     

             <vevent xmlns="urn:schemas:ical:">

       5.4.  vjournal  XML element 

          Name:         vjournal 

          Purpose:      Provide a grouping of component properties that 
                        describe a journal entry.     

          Description:  A "vjournal" calendar component is a grouping of    
                        component properties that represent one or more 
                        descriptive text notes on a particular calendar 
                        date. The "dtstart" property is used to specify the 
                        calendar date that the journal entry is associated 
                        with. Generally, it will have a DATE value data 
                        type, but it MAY also be used to specify a DATE-
                        TIME value data type.  

                        Examples of a journal entry include a daily record 
                        of a legislative body or a journal entry of 
                        individual telephone contacts for the day or an 
                        ordered list of accomplishments for the day. The 
                        "vjournal" calendar component can also be used to 
                        associate a document with a calendar date.  

                        The "vjournal" calendar component does not take up 
                        time on a calendar. Hence, it does not play a role 
                        in free or busy time searches -- it is as though it 
                        has a time transparency value of transparent. It is 
                        transparent to any such searches.     

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT vjournal (attach*, attendee*, 
                        categories*, class?, comment*, contact*, created?,

       5.5.vfreebusy XML element 

          Name:         vfreebusy 

          Purpose:      Provide a grouping of component properties that 
                        describe either a request for free/busy time, 
                        describe a response to a request for free/busy time 
                        or describe a published set of busy time.     

          Description:  A "vfreebusy" calendar component is a grouping of 
                        component properties that represents either a 
                        request for, a reply to a request for free or busy 
                        time information or a published set of busy time 
                        information.   

                        The "vfreebusy" calendar component is intended for 
                        use in iCalendar object methods involving requests 
                        for free time, requests for busy time, requests for 
                        both free and busy, and the associated replies. The 
                        recurrence properties  ("rrule", "exrule", "rdate", 
                        "exdate") are not permitted within a "vfreebusy" 
                        calendar component. Any recurring events are 
                        resolved into their individual busy time periods 
                        using the "freebusy" property.

       5.9.vtimezone XML element 

          Name:         vtimezone 

          Purpose:      Provide a grouping of component properties that 
                        defines a time zone.  

          Description:  A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of 
                        time measurement rules determined by the governing 
                        body for a given geographic area. These rules 
                        describe at a minimum the base offset from UTC for 
                        the time zone, often referred to as the Standard 
                        Time offset.  

                        If present, the "vtimezone" calendar component 
                        defines the set of Standard Time and Daylight 
                        Saving Time observances (or rules) for a particular 
                        time zone for a given interval of time. The 
                        "vtimezone" calendar component cannot be nested 
                        within other calendar components.

                        Multiple "vtimezone" calendar components MAY exist 
                        in an iCalendar object. In this situation, each 
                        "vtimezone" MUST represent a unique time zone 
                        definition. This is necessary for some classes of 
                        events, such as airline flights, that start in one 
                        time zone and end in another.  

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT vtimezone ( tzid, lastmodified?, tzurl?, 
                        (standard | daylight)) > 

                        The properties in a "vtimezone" element are: The 
                        mandatory "tzid" property is a text value that 
                        uniquely identifies the "vtimezone" calendar 
                        component within the scope of an iCalendar object. 
                        The optional "lastmodified" property is a UTC value 
                        that specifies the date and time that this timezone 
                        definition was updated. The optional "tzurl" 
                        property is a url value that points to a published 
                        "vtimezone" definiton. 

       5.9.1.  Example: vtimezone using rdate 

          The following are examples of the "vtimezone" calendar component: 
          This is a simple example showing time zone information for the 
          Eastern United States using "rdate" property. Note that this is 
          only suitable for a recurring event that starts on or later than 
          April 6, 1997 at 02:00:00 EST (i.e., the earliest effective 
          transition date and  time) and ends no later than April 7, 1998 
          02:00:00 EST (i.e., latest valid date and time  for EST in this 
          scenario).  For example, this can be used for a recurring event 
          that occurs every Friday, 8am-9am, starting June 1, 1997, ending 
          December 31, 1997.

          This is a simple example showing the current time zone rules for 
          the Eastern United States using a rrule recurrence pattern. Note 
          that there is no effective end date to either of the standard 
          Time or Daylight Time rules. This information would be valid for 
          a recurring event starting today and continuing on into the known 
          future.

                        used to define a reminder for a pending event or an 
                        overdue to-do. The "valarm" calendar component MUST 
                        include the "alarmtype" and "trigger" properties. 
                        In addition, an AUDIO type of alarm MUST include 
                        the "attach" property to point to a digital sound 
                        resource to be played. The DISPLAY type of alarm 
                        MUST include the "description" property. The EMAIL 
                        type of alarm MUST include the "attendee", 
                        "description" and "summary" properties. The 
                        PROCEDURE type of alarm MUST include the "attach" 
                        property to point to a procedure resource to be 
                        invoked. The "valarm" calendar component MUST only 
                        appear within either a "vevent" or "vtodo" calendar 
                        component. The "valarm" calendar components cannot 
                        be nested. Multiple "valarm" calendar components 
                        MAY be specified.

          Purpose:      This property specifies the date and time that a 
                        calendar component ends. 

          Datatype:     DATE-TIME; The default datatype is DATE-TIME. The 
                        datatype MAY BE reset to a DATE type.     

          Description:  Within the "vevent" calendar component, this 
                        property defines the date and time by which the 
                        event ends. The value MUST be later in time than 
                        the value of the "dtstart" property. Within the 
                        "vfreebusy" calendar component, this property 
                        defines the end date and time for the free or busy 
                        time information.  Within the "freebusy" element, 
                        this property defines the end date and time for the 
                        individual busy period. 

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT dtend(#PCDATA)> 

          Example:      <dtend DCD:dt="dateTime.dt">1997-03-T13:30</dtend>

          Description:  This property will assist in the proper sequencing 
                        of messages containing iCalendar objects. This 
                        property is different than the "created" and 
                        "lastmodified" properties. These two properties are 
                        used to specify when the calendar service 
                        information was created and last modified. This is 
                        different than when the iCalendar object 
                        representation of the calendar service information 
                        was created or last modified.

          Description:  In a "vevent" calendar component, specifies a 
                        duration of the event, instead of an explicit end 
                        date/time.  

                        In a "vtodo" calendar component, specifies a 
                        duration for the to-do, instead of an explicit due 
                        date/time.

                        duration. time format. The "freebusy" element MAY 
                        include the "busystatus" property parameter to 
                        specify whether the information defines a FREE or 
                        BUSY time interval. The default "TYPE" property 
                        parameter value is BUSY.  

                        List elements within the "freebusy" elements SHOULD 
                        be sorted in ascending order, based on start time 
                        and then end time, with the earliest periods first.

          Name:         lastmodified     

          Purpose:      The property specifies the date and time that the 
                        information associated with the calendar component 
                        was last revised. 

          Datatype:     Default datatype is ISO date/time ("dateTime.tz"). 

       6.25.   location  

          Name:         location     

          Purpose:      The property defines the intended venue for the 
                        activity defined by a calendar component.     

          Description:  Specific venues such as conference or meeting rooms 
                        may be explicitly specified using this property. An 
                        alternate representation may be specified that is a 
                        URI that points to directory information with more 
                        structured specification of the location. This 
                        element may include the xml:lang attribute. 

                        When more than one location appears in a calendar 
                        component, at least one location MUST be a string, 
                        and others MAY be alternate formats (i.e. URI) 
                        identified with a data type. 

          Datatype:     Default datatype is a string.

          Purpose:      The property defines the organizer for a calendar 
                        component.     

          Datatype:     Default datatype is a URI to be interpreted as a 
                        calendaring address.

          Description:  The element is specified within the "vevent", 
                        "vtodo", "vjournal calendar components to specify 
                        the organizer of a group scheduled calendar entity.  

                        The element is specified within the "vfreebusy" 
                        calendar component to specify the calendar user 
                        requesting the free or busy time.  

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT organizer(cn?, url, direntry?, sentby?)>     

                        This element MUST have a url which is a calendar 
                        address. 

          Example:

       6.27.   percentcomplete  

          Name:         percentcomplete 

          Purpose:      This property is used by an assignee or delegatee 
                        of a to-do to convey the percent completion of a 
                        to-do to the Organizer. 

          Description:  The property value is a postive integer between 
                        zero and one hundred. A value of "0" indicates the 
                        to-do has not yet been started. A value of "100" 
                        indicates that the to-do has been completed. 
                        Integer values in between indicate the percent 
                        partially complete. 

          Example:      <percentcomplete DCD:dt="int">50</percentcomplete> 

       6.28.   priority  

          Name:         priority     

          Purpose:      The property defines the relative priority for a 
                        calendar component.     

          Description:  The priority is specified as an integer in the 
                        range zero to nine. A value of zero (ASCII decimal 
                        48) specifies an undefined priority. A value of one 
                        (ASCII decimal 49) is the highest priority. A value

                        of two (ASCII decimal 50) is the second highest 
                        priority. Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing 
                        ordinal priority. A value of nine (ASCII decimal 
                        58) is the lowest priority. Within a "vevent" 
                        calendar component, this property specifies a 
                        priority for the event. This property may be useful 
                        when more than    one event is scheduled for a 
                        given time period. Within a "vtodo" calendar 
                        component, this property specified a priority for 
                        the to-do. This property is useful in prioritizing 
                        multiple action items for a given time period. 

       6.29.   rdate  

          Name:         rdate     

          Purpose:      This property defines the list of date/times for a 
                        recurrence set.     

          Datatype:     Default datatype is a list of ISO date/time 
                        ("dateTime.tz").  Alternately may contain "dtstart" 
                        and "duration". 

                        Issue:  It is unclear what it means to have a 
                        duration for a recurrence date, so it may be wrong 
                        to allow dtstart and duration here. 

          Description:  This property MAY appear along with the "rrule" to 
                        define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences. 
                        When they both appear in an iCalendar object, the 
                        recurring events are defined by the union of 
                        occurrences defined by both the "rdate" and 
                        "rrule". The recurrence dates, if specified, is 
                        used in computing the recurrence set. The 
                        recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence 
                        instances for a calendar component.     

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT rdate(#PCDATA)>     

          Examples: 

             <rdate> 
               <li>1997-03-08</li> 
               <li>1997-03-15</li>

          Internet-Draft             iCAL in XML            November 18, 1998 

          Purpose:      This property is used in conjunction with the "uid" 
                        and "sequence" property to identify a specific 
                        instance of a recurring "vevent", "vtodo" or 
                        "vjournal" calendar component. The property value 
                        is the effective value of the "dtstart" property of 
                        the recurrence instance.  

          Datatype:     The default data type for this property is an ISO 
                        extended date/time value without time zone 
                        identifier ("dateTime").  The time format MAY be 
                        any of valid date/time value. See [iCAL] for 
                        specific interpretations of the various date/time 
                        formats.   

          Description:  The full range of calendar components specified by 
                        a recurrence set is referenced by referring to just 
                        the "uid" property value corresponding to the 
                        calendar component. The "recurrence-id" property 
                        allows the reference to an individual instance 
                        within the recurrence set. If the value of the 
                        "dtstart" property only has a date part, then the 
                        value of recurid MUST be the calendar date for the 
                        recurrence instance. The date/time value is set to 
                        the time when the original recurrence instance 
                        would occur -- meaning that if the intent is to 
                        change a Friday meeting to Thursday, the date/time 
                        is still set to the original Friday meeting.  

                        The "recurid" property is used in conjunction with 
                        the "uid" and "SEQUENCE" property to identify a 
                        particular instance of a recurring event, to-do or 
                        journal. For a given pair of "uid" and "SEQUENCE" 
                        property values, the "recurid" value for a 
                        recurrence instance is fixed.  

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT recurid(#PCDATA)>  

          Example:      <recurid>1997-09-09</recurid> 

       6.31.   relatedto  

          Name:         relatedto     

          Purpose:      The property is used to represent a relationship or 
                        reference between one calendar component and 
                        another.  

          Description:  The property value consists of the persistent, 
                        globally unique identifier of another calendar 
                        component. This value would be represented in a 
                        calendar component by the "uid" property. By 
                        default, the property value points to another 
                        calendar component that has a PARENT relationship 
                        to the referencing object. The "RELTYPE" property 
                        parameter is used to either explicitly state the

       6.32.   requeststatus  

          Name:         requeststatus     

          Purpose:      This property defines the status code returned for 
                        a scheduling request.     

          Description:  This property is used to return status code 
                        information related to the processing of an 
                        associated iCalendar object. The data type for this 
                        property is TEXT.  The value consists of a short 
                        return status, a longer return status    
                        description, and optionally the offending data. The 
                        components of the    value are separated by the 
                        SEMICOLON character (ASCII decimal 59). The short 
                        return status is a PERIOD character (ASCII decimal 
                        46) separated 3-tuple of integers. For example, 
                        "3.1.1". The successive levels of integers provide 
                        for a successive level of status code granularity.

          Name:         rrule     

          Purpose:      This property defines a rule or repeating pattern 
                        for a recurring events, to-dos, or time zone 
                        definitions.  

          Description:  The recurring rule, if specified, is used in 
                        computing the recurrence set. The recurrence set is 
                        the complete set of recurrence instances for a 
                        calendar component. 

                        The attributes used to specify the recurrance are 
                        defined by [iCAL].

       6.34.1. Alternative rrule format 

          The WG should consider an alternative format that uses XML 
          elements. This would be the most flexible for future enhancements 
          to the protocol, although it is most bulky.  (similarly for 
          exrule). 

             <rrule> 
               <freq>YEARLY</freq> 
               <byday>-1SU</byday> 
               <bymonth>10</bymonth> 
             </rrule> 
              
       6.35.   sequence  

          Name:         sequence     

          Purpose:      This property defines the revision sequence of the 
                        calendar component used in a request.  

          Datatype:     Default data type is an "int" 

          Description:  This property is needed to properly handle the 
                        receipt and processing of a sequence of calendar 
                        components that have been delivered out of order. 
                        Such is the case for store-and-forward based 
                        transports. The first request is created with a 
                        sequence number of "0" (ASCII decimal 48). It is 
                        incremented each time the organizer or OWNER issues 
                        a revision to the request. 

       6.36.   sentby  

          Name:         sentby 

          Purpose:      This contains information on the delegate, the user 
                        who sent an item on behalf of the organizer. 

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT sentby (cn?, direntry?) 

          Example: 

             <sentby> 
               <cn href=jdoe@host1.com>John Doe</cn>

       6.37.   status  

          Name:         status 

          Purpose:      This property defines the overall status or 
                        confirmation for the calendar component.  
                        Description: In a group scheduled calendar 
                        component, the property is used by the "Organizer"

                        to provide a confirmation of the event to the 
                        "Attendees". For example in a "vevent" calendar 
                        component, the "Organizer" can indicate that a 
                        meeting is tentative, confirmed or cancelled. In a 
                        "vtodo" calendar component, the "Organizer" can 
                        indicate that an action item needs action, is 
                        completed, is in process or being worked on, or has 
                        been cancelled. In a "vjournal" calendar component, 
                        the "Organizer" can indicate that a journal entry 
                        is draft, final or has been cancelled or removed. 

          Datatype:     String 

          Value:        As defined by [iCAL]

          Purpose:      Provide a status code for the "requeststatus" 
                        element. 

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT statuscode (#PCDATA)> 

       6.39.   summary  

          Name:         summary  

          Purpose:      This property defines a short summary or subject 
                        for the calendar component.  

          Description:  This property is used to capture a short, one line 
                        summary about the activity or journal entry.     

                        This element may include the xml:lang or href 
                        attributes. 

          Example:

       6.41.   trigger 

          Name:         trigger     

          Purpose:      This property specifies when an alarm will trigger.  

          Description:  Within the "VALARM" calendar component, this 
                        property defines when the alarm will trigger. The 
                        trigger can contain a duration, specifying a 
                        relative time for the trigger of the alarm. The 
                        default duration is relative to the start of an 
                        event or to-do that the alarm is associated with. 
                        The duration can be explicitly set to trigger from 
                        either the end or the start of the associated event 
                        or to-do with the "from" element.  

                        A value of START for the "from" element will set 
                        the alarm to trigger off the start of the 
                        associated event or to-do. A value of END will set 
                        the alarm to trigger off the end of the associated 
                        event or to-do. 

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT trigger( (from?, duration) | (dtstart) )>     

       6.41.1. 
               Example trigger from start 

             <trigger> 
               <from>start</from> 
               <duration>PT5M</duration> 
             </trigger> 
              
          Equivalent format since "start" is assumed: 

             <trigger><duration>PT5M</duration></trigger> 
              
       6.41.2. 
               Example trigger at defined time

       6.43.   uid  

          Name:         uid  

          Purpose:      This property defines the persistent, globally 
                        unique identifier for the calendar component.   

                        The uid itself MUST be an internet-wide globally 
                        unique identifier for the calendar component. The 
                        generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the 
                        identifier is unique. There are several algorithms 
                        that can be used to accomplish this. The identifier 
                        MAY be the identical syntax to the [RFC 822] addr-
                        spec.  

          Definition:   <!ELEMENT uid(#PCDATA)> 

       7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 

          There are existing ways to encrypt XML bodies, so using XML as a 
          format for iCAL components should improve security.
