Internet-Draft     RADIUS Attributes for Key Delivery      February 2005


1.  Introduction

   Many remote access deployments (for example, deployments utilizing
   wireless LAN technology) require the secure transmission of session
   keys from an authentication server to a network access point.
   Currently, this transfer is most often accomplished using
   vendor-specific RADIUS attributes [RFC2548], with the integrity of
   the message protected by the RADIUS Response Authenticator [RFC2865],
   the Request and Response Authenticators (in the cases of RADIUS
   Accounting [RFC2866] and Dynamic Authorization [RFC3576]) or the
   Message-Authenticator Attribute [RFC3579].  However, there are
   several issues with these techniques:

   o  The key transport attributes were designed for use with a
      specific, proprietary protocol [RFC3078] and may be inappropriate
      for other uses

   o  The security properties and strength of the encryption method used
      to hide the keys are unknown

   o  The hash function ([RFC1321]) used in the construction of the
      Response Authenticator is proprietary and the construct itself is
      weaker than more modern methods (e.g., HMAC [RFC2104])

   o  The Message-Authenticator Attribute is unusable in some situations
      where strong message authentication might be required

   This document defines a set of RADIUS Attributes that can be used to
   securely transfer encryption keys using non-proprietary techniques
   with well understood security properties.  In addition, the
   Message-Authentication-Code Attribute may be used to provide strong
   authentication for any RADIUS message, including those used for
   accounting and dynamic authorization.

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the authors.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Attributes

   The following subsections describe the Attributes defined by this
   document.  This specification concerns the following values:

      [TBD1]    Key

      [TBD2]    Nonce

      [TBD3]    Message-Authentication-Code


3.1  Key

   Description

      This Attribute MAY be used to carry an encryption key from a
      RADIUS server to a client.

      It MAY be sent in request messages (e.g.,  Access-Request, etc.),
      as well; if the Key Attribute is present in a request, it SHOULD
      be taken as a hint by the server that the client prefers this
      method of key delivery over others, the server is not obligated to
      honor the hint, however.  When the Key Attribute is included in a
      request message the Key ID, Lifetime, IV and Key fields MAY be
      omitted.

      Any packet that contains a Key Attribute MUST also include a
      Message-Authentication-Code Attribute.  If the client requires the
      use of the Key Attribute for key delivery and it is not present in
      the Access-Accept or Access-Challenge message, the client MAY
      ignore the message in question and end the user session.

      The Key Attribute MUST NOT be used to transfer long-lived keys
      (i.e., passwords) between RADIUS servers and clients.

      A summary of the Key attribute format is shown below.  The fields
      are transmitted from left to right.

      Enc Type

         The Enc Type field indicates the method used to encrypt the key
         that is carried in the Key field.  This document defines only
         one value (decimal) for this field:

            0	AES Key Wrap with 128-bit KEK [RFC3394]

         Other values are to be assigned by IANA.

         Implementation Note

            A shared secret is used as the key-encrypting-key (KEK) for
            the AES key wrap algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD provide
            a means to provision a key (cryptographically separate from
            the normal RADIUS shared secret) to be used exclusively as a
            KEK.

      App ID

         The App ID field is 4 octets in length and identifies the type
         of application for which the key is to be used.  Further
         specification of the content of this field is outside the scope
         of this document.

      KEK ID

         The KEK ID field is 16 octets in length and contains an
         identifier for the KEK.  Further specification of the content
         of this field is outside the scope of this document.

      Key ID

         The Key ID field is 16 octets in length and contains an
         identifier for the key.  Further specification of the content
         of this field is outside the scope of this document.

      Lifetime

         The Lifetime field is an integer [RFC2865] representing the
         period of time (in seconds) for which the IV and keying
         material are valid.

         Note: Applications using this value SHOULD consider the
         beginning of the key lifetime to be the point in time when the
         key is first used for either encryption or decryption.

      IV

         The length of the IV field depends upon the value of the Enc
         Type field, but is fixed for any given value thereof.  When the
         value of the Enc Type field is 0 (decimal), the IV field MUST
         be 8 octets in length (as illustrated above) and the default
         value for the IV field is as specified in [RFC3394].

      Key

         The Key field is variable length and contains the actual
         encrypted keying material.


3.2  Nonce

   Description

      The Nonce Attribute SHOULD be used in conjunction with the
      Message-Authentication-Code Attribute (Section 3.3) to both
      provide randomness to the MAC and a connection between requests
      and responses.  The Random field MUST contain a 20 octet random
      number which SHOULD satisfy the requirements of [RFC1750].

      Implementation Note

         The Random field MUST be filled in before the MAC is computed.

      A summary of the Nonce attribute format is shown below.  The
      fields are transmitted from left to right.


    0                   1                   2                   3

      Random

         This field MUST contain a 32 octet random number which SHOULD
         satisfy the requirements of [RFC1750].


3.3  Message-Authentication-Code

   Description

      This Attribute MAY be used to "sign" messages to prevent spoofing
      If it is present in a request, the receiver should take this a
      hint that the sender prefers the use of this Attribute for message
      authentication; the receiver is not obligated to do so, however.

      The Message-Authentication-Code Attribute MUST be included in any
      message that contains a Key attribute.

      If any message is received containing a
      Message-Authentication-Code Attribute, the receiver MUST calculate
      the correct value of the Message-Authentication-Code and silently
      discard the packet if the computed value does not match the value
      received.

      If a received message contains an instance of the Nonce Attribute
      (Section 3.2), the received Nonce Attribute SHOULD be included in
      the computation of the MAC field, as described below.

      A summary of the Message-Authentication-Code attribute format is
      shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.


      0                   1                   2                   3

      Type

         [TBD3] for Message-Authentication-Code

      Length

         >3

      Reserved

         This field is reserved for future usage and MUST be
         zero-filled.

      MAC Type

         The MAC Type field specifies the algorithm used to create the
         value in the MAC field.  This document defines two values for
         the MAC Type field:

            0	HMAC-MD5 [RFC1321][RFC2104]

            1	HMAC-SHA-1 [FIPS.180-2.2002][RFC2104]

            2	HMAC-SHA-256 [FIPS.180-2.2002][RFC2104]

            3	HMAC-SHA-512 [FIPS.180-2.2002][RFC2104]

         Other values are to be assigned by IANA.

      MAC Key ID

         The MAC Key ID field is 16 octets in length and contains an
         identifier for the key.  Further specification of the content
         of this field is outside the scope of this document.

      MAC

         Both the length and value of the MAC field depend upon the
         algorithm specified by the value of the MAC Type field.  If the
         algorithm specified is HMAC-MD5, the length of the MAC field
         MUST be 16 octets, while if the specified algorithm is
         HAMC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256 or HMAC-SHA-512, the MAC field MUST be
         20, 32 or 64 octets in length, respectively.  The derivation of
         the MAC field value for all the algorithms specified in this
         document is identical, except for the algorithm used.  There
         are differences, however, depending upon whether the MAC is

         being computed for a request message or a response.  These
         differences are detailed below, with the free variable HASH-ALG
         representing the actual algorithm used.



         Request Messages

            For requests (e.g., CoA-Request [RFC3576],
            Accounting-Request [RFC2866], etc.), the value of the MAC
            field is a hash of the entire packet, including Type, ID,
            Length and Request Authenticator, using a shared secret as
            the key, as follows.

            MAC = HASH-ALG(Type, Identifier, Length, Request
            Authenticator, Attributes)

            The Nonce Attribute (Section 3.2) SHOULD be included in any
            request in which the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute
            is used; if the Nonce Attribute is included, it  MUST be
            filled in before the value of the MAC field is computed.

            Implementation Notes

               When the hash is calculated the MAC field MUST be
               considered to be zero-filled.

               Implementations SHOULD provide a means to provision a key
               (cryptographically separate from the normal RADIUS shared
               secret) to be used exclusively in the generation of the
               Message-Authentication-Code.

         Response Messages

            For responses (e.g., CoA-ACK [RFC3576], Accounting-Response
            [RFC2866], etc.), the value of the MAC field is a hash of
            the entire packet, including Type, ID, Length and Request
            Authenticator, using a shared secret as the key, as follows.

            MAC = HASH-ALG(Type, Identifier, Length, Request
            Authenticator, Attributes)

            If the request contained an instance of the Nonce Attribute
            and the responder wishes to include an instance of the
            Message-Authentication-Code Attribute in the corresponding
            response, then the Nonce Attribute from the request MUST be
            included in the response.

Internet-Draft     RADIUS Attributes for Key Delivery      February 2005


            Implementation Notes

               When the hash is calculated the value of the MAC field
               MUST be considered to be 16 octets of zero.

               The Message-Authentication-Code Attribute MUST be created
               and inserted in the packet before the Response
               Authenticator is calculated.

               Implementations SHOULD provide a means to provision a key
               (cryptographically separate from the normal RADIUS shared
               secret) to be used exclusively in the generation of the
               Message-Authentication-Code.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This section explains the criteria to be used by the IANA for
   assignment of numbers within namespaces defined within this document.
   The "Specification Required" policy is used here with the meaning
   defined in BCP 26 [RFC2434].

5.  Attribute Types

   Upon publication of this document as an  RFC, IANA must assign
   numbers to the Key [TBD1], Nonce [TBD2] and
   Message-Authentication-Code [TBD3] Attributes.

6.  Attribute Values

   As defined in Section 3.1, numbers may need to be assigned for future
   values of the Enc Type field of the Key attribute.  These numbers may
   be assigned by applying the "Specification Required" policy.  In
   particular, specifications MUST define the length of the IV field for
   the algorithm used.

   As defined in Section 3.2, numbers may need to be assigned for future
   values of the MAC Type field of the Message-Authentication-Code
   attribute.  These numbers may be assigned by applying the
   "Specification Required" policy.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED in this memo that two new keys be shared by the
   RADIUS client and server.  If implemented, these two keys MUST be
   different from each other and SHOULD NOT be based on a password.
   These two keys SHOULD be cryptographically independent of the RADIUS
   shared secret used in calculating the Response Authenticator

   [RFC2865].

   If more than one Key Attribute is included in a single RADIUS packet,
   the IV field of each Key Attribute SHOULD be unique.
