Abstract

   This Internet-Draft proposes an extension to the URL MIME External-
   Body Access-Type as defined in RFC2017 [7] to satisfy the content
   indirection requirements defined in draft-ietf-sipping-content-
   indirect-00 [1].  These extensions are aimed at allowing any MIME
   part in a SIP message to be referred to indirectly via a URL [4].

2. Introduction

   Previous attempts at solving the content indirection problem made use
   of the text/uri-list [8] MIME type.  While attractive for its
   simplicity (a list of URIs delimted by end-of-line markers), it fails
   to satisfy a number of the requirements for a more general purpose
   content indirection mechanism.  Most notably lacking is the ability
   to specify various attributes on a per-URL basis.  These attributes
   might include version information, the MIME type of the referenced
   content, etc.

   In searching for a replacement for the text/uri-list MIME type,
   RFC2017 defines a strong candidate.  RFC2017 defines an extension to
   the message/external-body MIME type defined in RFC2046 [6].  The
   extension that RFC2017 defines is to allow a generic URI to specify
   the location of the content rather than protocol specific parameters
   for FTP, etc.  as originally defined in RFC2046.  While providing
   most of the functionality needed for a SIP content indirection
   mechanism, RFC2017 is not a complete solution.  This document will
   define extensions to and deviations from RFC2017 necessary to fulfill
   the requirments outlined for content indirection.

   The requirements of [1] can be classified as applying either to the
   URL which indirectly references the desired content or to the content
   itself.  Where possible, existing MIME parameters and entity headers
   will be used to satisfy those requirements.  MIME (Content-Type)
   parameters will be the preferred manner of describing the URL while
   entity headers will be the preferred manner of describing the
   (indirect) content.  See RFC 2045 [5] for a description of most of
   these entity headers and MIME parameters.

3. Application of RFC2017 to the Content Indirection Problem

   The following text describes the application of RFC2017 to the
   requirements for content indirection.

3.1 Specifying the location of the content via a URL

   The URL for the indirect content is specified in a "URL" parameter of
   the message/external-body MIME type.  An access-type parameter
   indicates that the external content is referenced by a URL.

   For example:


                        Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
                                      URL="http://www.bogus.com/the-indirect-content"


3.2 Specifying versioning information for the URL

   In order to determine whether or not the content indirectly
   referenced by the URL has changed, a Content-ID entity header is
   used.  The syntax of this header follows that of the Call-ID in SIP.
   Changes in the underlying content referred to by a URL MUST result in
   a change in the Content-ID associated with that URL.  Multiple SIP
   messages carrying URLs that refer to the same content SHOULD reuse
   the same Content-ID to allow the receiver to cache this content and
   avoid unnecessary lookups.  The Content-ID is intended to be globally
   unique and SHOULD be temporally unique across SIP dialogs.

   For example:


                        Content-ID: 4232423424@www.bogus.com


3.3 Specifying the lifetime of the URL

   The URL supplied by in Content-Type header is not required to be
   accessible or valid for an indefinite period of time.  Rather, the
   supplier of the URL MUST specify the time period for which this URL
   is valid and accessible.  This is done through an "EXPIRATION"
   parameter of the Content-Type.  The format of this expiration
   parameter is a RFC1123 date-time value.  This is further restricted
   in this application to use only GMT time, consistent with the Date:
   header in SIP.  This is a mandatory parameter.

   For example:

Internet-Draft     Content Indirection in SIP Messages         June 2002


                        Content-Type: message/external-body; expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT"


3.4 Specifying support for content indirection

   A UAC/UAS may indicate support for content indirection through an
   Accept header containing the message/external-body MIME type.  In the
   absence of any other Accept headers, this indicates support for
   content indirection of the application/sdp MIME type.  If other
   Accept values are present, this indicates support for content
   indirection of those MIME types as well.  User-Agents supporting
   content indirection MUST support content indirection of the
   application/sdp MIME type.

   For example:


                        Accept: message/external-body, image/*, application/sdp


3.5 Rejecting content indirection

   If a UAS receives a SIP request which contains a content indirection
   payload, and the UAS cannot or does not wish to support such a
   content type, it MUST reject the request with a 415 Unsupported Media
   Type response as defined in section 21.4.13 of SIP [3].  In
   particular, the UAC should note the absence of the message/external-
   body MIME type in the Accept header of this response to indicate that
   the UAS does not support content indirection.

3.6 Specifying the type of the indirect content

   To support existing SIP mechanisms for the negotiation of content
   types, a Content-Type entity header SHOULD be present in the entity
   (payload) itself.  If the protocol (scheme) of the URL supports its
   own content negotiation mechanisms (e.g.  HTTP), this header may be
   omitted.  The sender MUST however be prepared for the receiving party
   to reject content indirection if the receiver is unable to negotiate
   an appropriate MIME type using the underlying protocol for the URL
   scheme.

   For example:

Internet-Draft     Content Indirection in SIP Messages         June 2002


                        Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
                                      expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
                                      URL="http://www.bogus.com/the-indirect-content"
                        <CRLF>
                        Content-Type: application/sdp
                        <CRLF>


3.7 Specifying the purpose of the indirect content

   A Content-Disposition entity header SHOULD be present for all
   indirect content.  In the absence of an an explicit Content-
   Disposition header, a content disposition of "session" should be
   assumed.

   For example:


                        Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL"; expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
                                      URL="http://www.bogus.com/the-indirect-content"
                        Content-Disposition: render
                        <CRLF>
                        Content-Type: image/jpeg
                        <CRLF>


3.8 Specifying multiple URLs for content indirection

   If there is a need to send multiple URLs for the purpose of content
   indirection, an appropriate multipart MIME type [6] should be used.
   Each URL should be contained in a single entity.  Indirect content
   may be mixed with directly supplied content.  This is particularly
   useful with the multipart/alternative MIME type.

   For example:

Internet-Draft     Content Indirection in SIP Messages         June 2002


                        MIME-Version: 1.0
                        Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary42

                        --boundary42
                        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

                        The company announcement for June, 2002 follows:
                        --boundary42
                        Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL"; expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
                                      URL="http://www.bogus.com/announcements/07242002"
                        Content-Disposition: render

                        Content-Type: text/html

                        --boundary42--



3.9 Supplying additional comments about the indirect content

   Optional, freeform text may be supplied to comment on the indirect
   content.  This should be supplied in a Content-Description entity
   header.

   For example:


                        Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL"; expiration="Mon, 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT";
                                      URL="http://www.bogus.com/the-indirect-content"
                        Content-Description: Multicast gaming session

5. Open Issues

   o  The exact placement of the Content-Disposition and Content-
      Description headers is open for discussion.  These might be placed
      in either the SIP message headers or in the entity itself.

   o  Is S/MIME protection sufficient for integrity protection of the
      indirect content?
