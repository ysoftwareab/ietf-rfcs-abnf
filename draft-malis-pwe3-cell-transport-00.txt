                PWE3 ATM Transparent Cell Transport Service


Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 [1].

Abstract

   The document describes a transparent cell transport service that
   makes use of the "N-to-one" cell relay mode for PWE3 ATM cell
   encapsulation described in [ATM-ENCAPS].

1. Introduction

   This transparent cell transport service allows migration of ATM
   services to a PSN without having to provision the ATM subscriber or
   customer edge (CE) devices.  The ATM CEs will view the ATM
   transparent cell transport service as if they were directly connected
   via a TDM leased line.  This service is most likely to be used as an
   internal function in a ATM service provider's network as a way to
   connect existing ATM switches via a higher speed PSN, or to provide
   ATM "backhaul" services for remote access to existing ATM networks.

2. Transparent Cell Transport Definition

   The transparent port service is a natural application of the "N-to-
   oneö cell relay mode for PWE3 ATM encapsulation described in [3].

   The ATM transparent port service emulates connectivity between two
   remote ATM ports. This service is useful when one desires to connect
   two CEs without processing or switching at the VPC or VCC layer.  The
   ingress PE discards any idle/unassigned cells received from the
   ingress ATM port, and maps all other received cells to a single
   Pseudo Wire, using the ôN-to-oneö cell relay encapsulation in [3].

   The egress PE doesnÆt change the VPI, VCI, PTI, or CLP bits when it
   sends these cells on the egress ATM port.  Therefore the transparent
   port service appears to emulate an ATM transmission convergence layer
   connection between two ports.  However, since the ingress PE discards
   idle/unassigned cells, this service benefits from statistical
   multiplexing.

3. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any new security considerations beyond
   those in [3].
