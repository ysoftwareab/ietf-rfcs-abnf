1.  Introduction

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first developed
   the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP, specified in
   [RFC4656].  Further protocol development to support testing resulted
   in the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol, TWAMP, specified in
   [RFC5357].

   Both OWAMP and TWAMP require the implementation of a control and mode
   negotiation protocol (OWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Control) which employs
   the reliable transport services of TCP (including security
   configuration and key derivation).  The control protocols arrange for
   the configuration and management of test sessions using the
   associated test protocol (OWAMP-Test or TWAMP-Test) on UDP transport.

   This memo recognizes the value of assigning a well-known UDP port to
   the *-Test protocols, and that this goal can easily be arranged
   through port re-assignments.

2.  Scope

   The scope of this memo is to re-allocate well-known ports for the UDP
   Test protocols that compose necessary parts of their respective

   standards track protocols, OWAMP and TWAMP (along with clarifications
   of the complete protocol composition).

   The memo updates [RFC4656] and [RFC5357], in terms of the UDP well-
   known port assignments.

3.  Definitions

   This section defines key terms and clarifies the required composition
   of the OWAMP and TWAMP standards-track protocols.

   OWAMP-Control is the protocol defined in Section 3 of [RFC4656].

   OWAMP-Test is the protocol defined in Section 4 of [RFC4656].

   OWAMP is described in a direct quote from Section 1.1 of[RFC4656]:
   "OWAMP actually consists of two inter-related protocols: OWAMP-
   Control and OWAMP-Test."  A similar sentence appears in Section 2 of
   [RFC4656].  Since the consensus of many dictionary definitions of
   "consist" is "composed or made up of", implementation of both OWAMP-
   Control and OWAMP-Test are REQUIRED for standards-track OWAMP for
   standards-track OWAMP specified in [RFC4656].

   TWAMP-Control is the protocol defined in Section 3 of [RFC5357].

   TWAMP-Test is the protocol defined in Section 4 of [RFC5357].

   TWAMP is described in a direct quote from Section 1.1 of [RFC5357]:
   "Similar to OWAMP [RFC4656], TWAMP consists of two inter-related
   protocols: TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test."  Since the consensus of
   many dictionary definitions of "consist" is "composed or made up of",
   implementation of both TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test are REQUIRED for
   standards-track TWAMP specified in [RFC5357].

   TWAMP Light is an idea described in Informative Appendix I of
   [RFC5357], and includes an un-specified control protocol (possibly
   communicating through non-standard means) combined with the TWAMP-
   Test protocol.  The TWAMP Light idea was relegated to the
   Appendix because it failed to meet the requirements for IETF
   protocols (there are no specifications for negotiating this form of
   operation, and no specifications for mandatory-to-implement security
   features), as decribed in the references below:

   o  Lars Eggert's Area Director review [LarsAD], where he pointed out
      that having two variants of TWAMP, Light and Complete (called
      standards track TWAMP here), required a protocol mechanism to
      negotiate which variant will be used.  See Lars' comment on Sec
      5.2.  The working group consensus was to place the TWAMP Light

      description in Appendix I, and to refer to the Appendix only as an
      "incremental path to adopting TWAMP, by implementing the TWAMP-
      Test protocol first".

   o  Tim Polk's DISCUSS Ballot, which points out that TWAMP Light was
      an incomplete specification because the key required for
      authenticated and encrypted modes depended on the TWAMP-Control
      Session key.  See Tim's DISCUSS on 2008-07-16 [TimDISCUSS].
      Additional requirement statements were added in the Appendix to
      address Tim's DISCUSS Ballot (see the last three paragraphs of
      Appendix I in [RFC5357]).

   Since the idea of TWAMP Light clearly includes the TWAMP-Test
   component of TWAMP, it is considered reasonable for future systems to
   use the TWAMP-Test well-known UDP port (whose re-allocated purpose is
   requested here).  Clearly, the TWAMP Light idea envisions many
   components and communication capabilities beyond TWAMP-Test
   (facilitating the security requirements, for example), otherwise the
   Appendix would be one sentence long (equivocating TWAMP Light with
   TWAMP-Test).

4.  New Well-Known Ports

   Originally, both TCP and UDP well-known ports were assigned to the
   control protocols that are essential components of standards track
   OWAMP and TWAMP.

   Since OWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Control require TCP transport, they
   cannot make use of the UDP ports which were originally assigned.
   However, test sessions using OWAMP-Test or TWAMP-Test operate on UDP
   transport.  It may simplify some operations to have a well-known port
   available for the Test protocols as a default port, and this memo
   requests re-assignment of the UDP well-known port from the Control
   protocol to the Test protocol (see the IANA Considerations section).

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live paths are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and [RFC5357].

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
   potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
   which are within this scope of work.  Passive observations of user
   traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.  We refer
   the reader to the security and privacy considerations described in
   the Large Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework
   [RFC7594], which covers both active and passive techniques.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA re-allocate UDP ports 861 and 862 as
   shown below, leaving the TCP port assignments as-is:

   Service       Port Protocol Description

   owamp-control 861  tcp      OWAMP-Control [RFC4656]

   owamp-test    861  udp      OWAMP-Test [RFCXXXX]

   twamp-control 862  tcp      Two-way Active Measurement
                               Protocol (TWAMP) Control [RFC5357]

   twamp-test    862  udp      Two-way Active Measurement
                               Protocol (TWAMP) Test [RFCXXXX]


   where RFCXXXX is this memo when published.
