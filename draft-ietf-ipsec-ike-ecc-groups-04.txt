   This document describes new ECC groups for use in IKE [IKE] in
   addition to the Oakley groups included therein.  These groups are
   defined to align IKE with other ECC implementations and standards,
   and in addition, many of them provide higher strength than the
   Oakley groups. It should be noted that this document is not
   self-contained.  It uses the notations and definitions of [IKE].

1.  Introduction

This document describes default groups for use in elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman in IKE in addition to the Oakley groups included in
[IKE].  The document assumes that the reader is familiar with the IKE
protocol and the concept of Oakley Groups, as defined in RFC 2409
[IKE].

RFC2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups - three modular
exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over
GF[2^N]. One modular exponentiation group (768 bits - Oakley Group 1)
is mandatory for all implementations to support, while the other
four are optional. Both elliptic curve groups (Oakley Groups 3 and 4)
are defined over GF[2^N] with N composite.

Implementations have shown that users of elliptic curve groups can
significantly improve their performance and achieve more security by
using groups other than the Oakley Groups 1, 2, or 5. The purpose of
this document is to expand the options available to implementers of
elliptic curve groups by adding eight new groups.  The reasons for
adding these new groups include the following.

- The groups proposed encourage alignment with other elliptic curve
  standards. Oakley Groups 3 and 4 were defined prior to the
  availability of other elliptic curve standards and they are
  therefore not aligned with other efforts.  Specifically, unlike
  Oakley groups 3 and 4, the proposed groups use base points whose
  order is prime (as required by IEEE [P1363] and ANSI [X9.62, X9.63]),
  they use base points whose prime order is greater than 2^160
  (as required by ANSI [X9.62, X9.63]), and they use the octet
  string representation for points recommended in IEEE [P1363] and
  ANSI [X9.62, X9.63].

- In addition the new groups are capable of providing security
  consistent with AES keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits. The following
  table, taken from [HOF] and [LEN], gives approximate comparable key
  sizes for symmetric systems, ECC systems, and DH/DSA/RSA
  systems. The estimates are based on the running times of the best
  algorithms known today.

                 Symmetric   |  ECC    |  DH/DSA/RSA
                   80        |  163    |   1024
                  128        |  283    |   3072
                  192        |  409    |   7680
                  256        |  571    |  15360

                  Table 1: comparable key sizes

  Thus, for example, when securing a 192-bit symmetric key, it is
  prudent to use either 409-bit ECC or 7680-bit DH/DSA/RSA. Of course
  it is possible to use shorter asymmetric keys, but it should be
  recognized in this case that the security of the system is likely
  dependent on the strength of the public-key algorithm and claims
  such as "this system is highly secure because it uses 192-bit
  encryption" are misleading.


- The eight groups proposed in this document use elliptic curves over
  GF[2^N] with N prime, unlike the existing Oakley Groups. This
  addresses concerns expressed by many experts regarding curves
  defined over GF[2^N] with N composite -- concerns highlighted by the
  recent attacks on such curves due to Gaudry, Hess, and Smart [WEIL]
  and due to Jacobson, Menezes and Stein [JMS].

- The eight groups proposed are amongst those recently standardized by
  NIST in FIPS 186-2 [DSS], by the SECG in SEC2 [SEC2], and by ANSI in
  ANSI X9.63 [X9.63].

These groups could also be defined using the New Group Mode but
including them in this RFC will encourage interoperability of IKE
implementations based upon elliptic curve groups. This is particularly
critical since the available Oakley Groups based on elliptic curves
are insufficient for the reasons given above.  In addition, the
availability of standardized groups will result in optimizations for a
particular curve and field size as well as allowing precomputation
that could result in faster implementations.

The groups proposed here have been assigned identifiers by IANA
[IANA]. Thus the full list of assigned values for the Group
Description class within IKE is the following. (The first four groups
may be found in RFC 2409 [IKE]; the last eight groups are defined in
this document.)

  Group Description                                           Value
  -----------------                                           -----
  Default 768-bit MODP group                                    1  
  Alternate 1024-bit MODP group                                 2  
  EC2NGF155 group over GF[2^155]                                3  
  EC2NGF185 group over GF[2^185]                                4  
  Reserved to IANA                                              5

  EC2NGF163Koblitz group over GF[2^163] (Section 2.2)           7  
  EC2NGF283Random group over GF[2^283] (Section 2.3)            8  
  EC2NGF283Koblitz group K-283 over GF[2^283] (Section 2.4)     9  
  EC2NGF409Random group B-409 over GF[2^409] (Section 2.5)     10
  EC2NGF409Koblitz group K-409 over GF[2^409] (Section 2.6)    11 
  EC2NGF571Random group B-571 over GF[2^571] (Section 2.7)     12 
  EC2NGF571Koblitz group K-571 over GF[2^571] (Section 2.8)    13 

In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve groups
in IKE implementations and the need for standardized groups as
alternatives to Oakley Groups 3 and 4, this document defines eight new
groups based on elliptic curve groups. The groups are defined at four
field sizes: GF[2^163], GF[2^283], GF[2^409] and GF[2^571]. These
field sizes correspond to 80-bit, 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit
symmetric key strengths respectively.

Two curves are defined at each strength - a Koblitz curve that enables
especially efficient implementations due to the special structure of
the curve [KOB, NSA] and a curve chosen verifiably at random (as
defined in ANSI [X9.62]). The groups are assigned numbers numbers 6 to
13 by IANA [IANA].

2. Additional ECC Groups

The notation adopted in RFC2409 [IKE] is used below to describe the
new groups proposed.

2.1 Sixth Group

IKE implementations SHOULD support an EC2N group with the following
characteristics. This group is assigned id 6 (six). The curve is
based on the Galois Field GF[2^163]. The field size is 163. The
irreducible polynomial used to represent the field is:
           u^163 + u^7 + u^6 + u^3 + 1.
The equation for the elliptic curve is:
           y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b.

Specifically the group is defined by the following characteristics:

Field size:
  163

Irreducible polynomial:
  0x0800000000000000000000000000000000000000C9

Group Curve a:
  0x07B6882CAAEFA84F9554FF8428BD88E246D2782AE2

Group Curve b:
  0x0713612DCDDCB40AAB946BDA29CA91F73AF958AFD9

Group Generator point P (compressed): 
  0x030369979697AB43897789566789567F787A7876A654

Group Generator point P (uncompressed): 
  0x040369979697AB43897789566789567F787A7876A654
      00435EDB42EFAFB2989D51FEFCE3C80988F41FF883

The order of the base point P defined above is the prime:
  0x03FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF48AAB689C29CA710279B

The group order is twice this prime.

The group was chosen verifiably at random using SHA-1 as specified in
[X9.62] from the seed:
  0x24B7B137C8A14D696E6768756151756FD0DA2E5C

INTERNET-DRAFT       Additional ECC Groups For IKE             July 2002


However, for historical reasons, the method to generate the group from
the seed differs slightly from the method described in
[X9.62]. Specifically the coefficient Group Curve b produced from the
seed is the reverse of the coefficient that would have been produced
by the method described in [X9.62].

The data in the KE payload when using this group is the octet string
representation specified in ANSI X9.62, ANSI X9.63, FIPS 186-2, and
IEEE P1363 of the point on the curve chosen by taking the randomly
chosen secret Ka and computing Ka*P, where * is the repetition of the
group addition and double operations.  Note that this payload differs
from the payload specified for groups 3 and 4 - it is aligned instead
with other recent standardization efforts in ECC.

This group corresponds to the curve sect163r1 in SEC 2 [SEC2].  It is
also recommended in ANSI X9.63 [X9.63] and eCheck [ECHECK].

2.2 Seventh Group

IKE implementations SHOULD support an EC2N group with the following
characteristics. This group is assigned id 7 (seven). The curve is
based on the Galois Field GF[2^163]. The field size is 163. The
irreducible polynomial used to represent the field is:
           u^163 + u^7 + u^6 + u^3 + 1.
The equation for the elliptic curve is:
           y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b.

Specifically the group is defined by the following characteristics:

Field size:
  163

Irreducible polynomial:
  0x0800000000000000000000000000000000000000C9

Group Curve a:
  0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

Group Curve b: 
  0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

Group Generator point P (compressed): 
  0x0302FE13C0537BBC11ACAA07D793DE4E6D5E5C94EEE8

Group Generator point P (uncompressed):
  0x0402FE13C0537BBC11ACAA07D793DE4E6D5E5C94EEE8
      0289070FB05D38FF58321F2E800536D538CCDAA3D9

The order of the base point P above is the prime:
  0x04000000000000000000020108A2E0CC0D99F8A5EF

The group order is twice this prime.

The data in the KE payload when using this group is the octet string
representation specified in ANSI X9.62, ANSI X9.63, FIPS 186-2, and
IEEE P1363 of the point on the curve chosen by taking the randomly
chosen secret Ka and computing Ka*P, where * is the repetition of the
group addition and double operations.  Note that the format of this
data is identical to the format used with Group 6 (six).

This group corresponds to the curve K-163 in FIPS 186-2 [DSS] and
sect163k1 in SEC 2 [SEC2].  It is also recommended in ANSI [X9.63],
eCheck [ECHECK], and WAP [WTLS].

2.3 Eighth Group

IKE implementations SHOULD support an EC2N group with the following
characteristics. This group is assigned id 8 (eight). The curve is
based on the Galois Field GF[2^283]. The field size is 283. The
irreducible polynomial used to represent the field is:
           u^283 + u^12 + u^7 + u^5 + 1.
The equation for the elliptic curve is:
           y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b.

Specifically the group is defined by the following characteristics:

Field size:
  283

The group was chosen verifiably at random in normal basis
representation using SHA-1 as specified in [X9.62] from the seed:

  0x77E2B07370EB0F832A6DD5B62DFC88CD06BB84BE

The data in the KE payload when using this group is the octet string
representation specified in ANSI X9.62, ANSI X9.63, FIPS 186-2, and
IEEE P1363 of the point on the curve chosen by taking the randomly
chosen secret Ka and computing Ka*P, where * is the repetition of the
group addition and double operations.  Note that the format of this
data is identical to the format used with Group 6 (six).

This group corresponds to the curve B-283 (in the polynomial basis) in
FIPS 186-2 [DSS] and sect283r1 in SEC 2 [SEC2].  It is also
recommended in ANSI [X9.63] and eCheck [ECHECK].

2.4 Ninth Group

IKE implementations SHOULD support an EC2N group with the following
characteristics. This group is assigned id 9 (nine). The curve is
based on the Galois Field GF[2^283]. The field size is 283. The
irreducible polynomial used to represent the field is:

3. Security Considerations

Since this document proposes new groups for use within IKE, many of
the security considerations contained within RFC 2409 apply here as
well.

Six of the groups proposed in this document offer higher strength than
those proposed in RFC 2409. In particular, there are two elliptic
curves corresponding to each of the symmetric key sizes 80 bits, 128
bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits. This allows the IKE key exchange to
offer security comparable with the proposed AES algorithms.

In addition, since all the new groups are defined over GF[2^N] with N
prime, they address the concerns expressed regarding the elliptic
curve groups included in RFC 2409, which are curves defined over
GF[2^N] with N composite. The works of Gaudry, Hess, and Smart [WEIL]
and of Jacobson, Menezes and Stein [JMS] reveal some of the weaknesses
in such groups.

Proper validation of elliptic curve public keys can help prevent the
attacks described in [BMM].
