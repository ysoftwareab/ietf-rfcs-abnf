   1   Introduction 
       
   This document describes a model for managing encapsulated SONET Time 
   Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital signals for transmission over a 
   Packet Switched Network (PSN). 
    
   This document is closely related to [CEP], which describes the 
   technology to encapsulate TDM signals and provide the Circuit 
   Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).  
    
   The model for CEP management is a MIB module. The CEP MIB module 
   described in this document works closely with the MIB modules 
   described in [PWMIB] and the textual conventions defined in [PWTC]. 
   In the spirit of the [RFC2863], a CEP connection will be a pseudo-
   wire (PW), and will therefore not be represented in the ifTable.  
    
   CEP is currently specified to carry "structured" SONET paths, meaning 
   that each SONET PATH/VT within the section/line/path can be processed 
   separately. The SONET section/line/path interface stack is modeled 
   within [RFC3592]. 
    
   Comments should be made directly to PWE3 group at pwe3@ietf.org. 
    
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for the 
   Internet community.

   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 
   [BCP14]. 
    
   2   Terminology 
 
   CEP terminology comes from the CEP draft that describes a mechanism 
   for transporting SONET Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital 
   signals over a packet-oriented network. The mechanism for structured 
   (as outlined in the CEP draft) terminates the SONET section and line 
   overhead and then breaks the SONET path's Synchronous Payload 
   Envelope (SPE) into fragments for transmission over a PSN. Mechanism 
   for terminating of the SONET path overhead and extracting SONET VTs 
   are also described in [CEP]. Mechanisms for Fractional SONET SPE 
   emulation are described in [CEP]. A CEP header is appended at the 
   beginning of each fragment to provide information regarding where 
   the SPE begins within the packet stream, a sequence number, and 
   pointer adjustment information (see [CEP]). 
    
   "Outbound" references the traffic direction where a SONET path's 
   payload (SPE) is received, adapted to packet, assigned a PW label, 
   and sent into the PSN.   
    
   Conversely, "inbound" is the direction where packets are received 
   from the PSN, packet payloads are reassembled back into an SPE, and 
   inserted as a SONET path into the SONET section and line.  
    
   Since A SONET path is bi-directional and symmetrical, it uses the 
   same SONET time-slot, SONET width and packet size. Inbound and 
   outbound PW labels may differ. 
    
   CEP will normally transmit into an originating "head" end of a PSN's 
   tunnel, and receive from a terminating "tail" end a PSN's tunnel. In 
   the case of an MPLS PSN, a CEP connection typically uses a PW Label 
   within a Tunnel Label [PW-SIG]. Multiple CEP PWs each with a unique 
   PW Label and similar traffic engineering requirements can share the 
   same PSN tunnel. For MPLS PSNs, the Tunnel Label is known as the 
   "outer" Label, while the PW Label is known as the "inner" Label. An 
   exception to this is with adjacent MPLS LSRs. In this case, there is 
   an option for CEP PWs to connect directly without an outer Label.  
    
   3   The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
 
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current    
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of   
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed   
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally   
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).   
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the   
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580   
   [RFC2580]. 
    
    
   4   CEP MIB architecture 
 
 
   The CPE MIB is part of the PW MIB modules architecture, as described 
   in [PWMIB], and serves as one of the PW type-specific MIB module 
    
   For clarity of the description below, in most cases we refer to the 
   PATH SONET signal configuration only. When configuring VT mode as 
   described in [CEP], the same apply for the VT level. 
     
    1.1 Summary of CEP MIB 
       
   - The CEP PW Table (pwCepTable) contains the SONET Path/VT ifIndex, 
   SONET Path Time slot, the pwCepCfgTable index, config error 
   indications, and various status indications.  
    
   - The CEP PW Configuration Parameter Table (pwCepCfgTable) has 
   objects for CEP PW configuration. In situations where sets of config 
   objects are common amongst more than 1 CEP PW, a single entry here 
   may be referenced by many pwCepTable entries. 
    
   - The CEP Performance Current Table (pwCemPerfCurrentTable) contains 
   CEP stats for the current 15-minute period.  
    
   - The CEP Performance Interval Table (pwCemPerfIntervalTable) is 
   similar to the pwCemPerfCurrentTable. It contains historical 
   intervals (usually 96 15-minute entries to cover a 24 hour period).  
    
   Note: the performance interval statistics are supported by CEP due to 
   the very function of CEP - that is, processing SONET. See [RFC3592]. 
    
   - The CEP Performance Total Table (pwCepPerfTotalTable) is similar to 
   the pwCemPerfCurrentTable. It contains statistics accumulated since 
   the CEP PW was first established. 
    
   - The CEP Fractional Table (pwCepFracTable) adds configuration and 
   monitoring parameters for fractional SPE PWs.  
    
   - The Conformance Config Table (pwCepConformanceCfgTable) allows the 
   vendor to specify the extent to which certain objects are supported 
   (or not). 
    
    1.2 CEP configuration Step by Step 
    
   Configuring a CEP PW involves the following steps. 
    
   First create an entry in the pwTable and configure the PSN tunnels: 
    
   - Follow steps as defined in [PWMIB].

   Internet Draft             PW CEP MIB                     July 2005 
    
    
   Configure the SONET Path parameters: 
    
   - Set the SONET path width in the sonetPathCurrentTable [RFC3592]. 
    
   - Set the SONET path index and the SONET path starting time slot in 
   the pwCepTable. 
    
   NOTE: The agent will have created an entry in the pwCepTable based on 
   the entry created in the pwTable.  
    
   Configure the CEP PW: 
    
   - If necessary, create an entry in the pwCepCfgTable (a suitable 
   entry may already exist). Set packet length, etc. 
    
   - Set the index of this pwCepCfgTable entry in the pwCepTable. 
    
    
   Observe the CEP PW: 
    
   - Once a CEP PW is operational, the pwCepPerfCurrentTable, 
   pwCepPerfIntervalTable, and pwCepPerfTotalTable are used to monitor 
   the various counts, indicators, and conditions of the PW. 
    
    
   Conforming to the CEP MIB objects: 
    
   - The pwCepConformanceCfgTable is used to state True/False whether 
   certain objects are supported. An ASCII string object is available 
   with every True/False object as a means to explain the extent of 
   'true' support, or perhaps explain why the 'false' was set.

   5   Example of CEP PW Setup 
    
   In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects 
   described in section 8 to set up a CEP PW (width of 3 STSs, starting 
   at time slot 1). While this example is not meant to illustrate every 
   permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding 
   some of the key concepts. It is meant to be read after going through 
   the MIB itself. See [PWMIB] for an example of setting up PSN Tunnels. 
    
   First configure the SONET path width, starting time-slot, and 
   associated CEP PW. In this case, an STS-3c starts at SONET time slot 
   1 (and is distributed normally within the SONET frame). In the 
   following example, the ifIndex for the sonetPathCurrentEntry is 23, 
   while the pwCepCfgTable index is 9. 
    
   In [RFC3592] sonetPathCurrentEntry (ifIndex = 23) : 
   { 
      sonetPathCurrentWidth           = 3, 
      sonetPathCurrentStatus 
      ... 
      ... 
   } 
    
   Create an entry in the pwCepCfgTable (index = 9) : 
   { 
      pwCepCfgSonetPaylaodLength    = 783 -- payload bytes 
      pwCepCfgMinPktLength          = 0   -- no minimum 
      pwCepCfgPktReorder            = true 
      pwCepCfgEnableDBA             = unequipped 
      pwCepCfgRtpHdrSuppress        = false 
      pwCepCfgJtrBfrDepth           = 500 -- micro-seconds 
    
      pwCepCfgConsecPktsInsync      = 2   -- Exit  LOPS state 
      pwCepCfgConsecMissingOutSync  = 10  -- Enter LOPS state 
    
      pwCepCfgPktErrorPlayOutValue  = 0xFF -- All ones 
    
      pwCepCfgMissingPktsToSes      =  3  -- packets, 
      pwCepCfgSesToUas              =  2  -- seconds, 
      pwCepCfgSecsToExitUas         = 10  -- seconds, 
    
      pwCepCfgRowStatus             = createAndGo 
   } 
    
   Check that there is no error bit set in pwCepConfigError.

   In the PW MIB module: Get a new index and create a new pwTable entry 
   using pwIndexNext (here, the PW index = 83) and pwRowStatus. In this 
   new entry, set pwType to 'cep'. This should create a new entry in the 
   pwCepTable. Set up and the SONET path ifIndex, SONET path time slot, 
   and Cfg Table indexes within this new pwCep table entry: 
    
   { 
      pwCepSonetIfIndex     = 23 -- Index of associated entry 
                                   -- in sonetPathCurrent table. 
    
      pwCepCfgIndex         = 9  -- Index of associated entry 
                                   -- in pwCepCfg table (above). 
   } 
    
 
   Verify that none of the error bits are set in pwCepSonetConfigError.

           CEP sequence number. Note: If the implementation supports  
           packet re-ordering, detecting gaps should not take place as  
           packets arrive, only as they are played out - this gives  
           time for mis-ordered packets to arrive late. 
            
           'ooRngDropped'(1) - Packet(s) arrives that is outside the 
           range of the jitter buffer. This may be because the 
           jitter buffer is full, or the sequence number addresses 
           a buffer outside the current jitter buffer range, or 
           addresses an already occupied buffer within range. 
           Whether or not packet re-ordering is supported by the 
           implementation, this indication MUST be supported. 
            
           'jtrBfrUnder'(2) - The jitter buffer underflowed due to 
           not enough packets arriving as packets were being 
           played out.  
            
           'pktBadLength'(3) - Non-bandwidth-saving packet arrives 
           larger or smaller than pwCepCfgSonetPayloadLength, or when 
           a fractional SPE packet length does not match the extension 
           header or manual configuration indicating the number of  
           equipped VTs.  
            
           'lops'(4) - Loss Of Packet Synchronization.

           Indication. Generated by the remote CEP de-packetizer when  
           detecting LOPS. Note: not generated by the remote SONET  
           function. See draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet.

           on its incoming SONET stream. Note: cepAis MUST NOT (in  
           itself) cause a CEP down notification.

          payload within one packet. For example, for STS-1/VC-3 SPE  
          circuits, value of 783 bytes indicates that each packet  
          carries payload equivalent to one frame. For VT1.5/VC11  
          circuits, a payload length of 104 bytes indicates that each  
          packet carries payload equivalent to one VT1.5 super-frame. 
          The actual payload size may be different, due to bandwidth  
          reduction modes, e.g. DBA mode or dynamically assigned  
          fractional SPE. This length applies to 
          inbound and outbound packets carrying user payload.  
          Although there is no control over inbound packets, those 
          of illegal length are discarded and accounted for (see  
          pwCepPerf...PktsBadLength.) 
          The default values are determined by the pwCepType: 
          783 for pwCepType equal spe(2) or fracSpe(3). 
          For vt(3) modes, the applicable super-frame payload size 
          is the default value.

   7   Security considerations 
    
   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
   monitoring of CEP PWs.  This MIB can also be used for configuration 
   of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be 
   incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results. 
       
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
     o  the pwCepTable, pwCepCfgTable and pwCepFracTable contains 
         objects to CEP PW parameters on a Provider Edge (PE) device. 
         Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in 
         disruption of traffic on the network.   
        The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should 
         be considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and 
         USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB

         module.  Administrators should consider whether read access to 
         these objects should be allowed, since read access may be 
         undesirable under certain circumstances. 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with 
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive 
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
    o    the pwCepTable, pwCepPerfCurrentTable, pwCepPerfIntervalTable 
         and pwCepPerfTotalTable collectively show the CEP pseudo wire 
         connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.   
         If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, 
         then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the 
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8", 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
   authentication and privacy". 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
   to the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.

   13  IANA considerations 
    
   PWE3 related standards track PW modules should be rooted under the 
   pwMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to manage that namespace.  New 
   assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in 
   [RFC2434]. 
    
   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the pwMIB 
   branch as specified in section 12.1.  
       
   12.1  IANA Considerations for PW-CEP-STD-MIB  
    
     This document also requests IANA to assign { pwMIB 5 } to the PW-
   CEP-STD-MIB module specified in this document.
