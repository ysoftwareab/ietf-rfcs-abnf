1. Introduction

   This document is a part of the ITU-T Recommendation and ISO/IEC
   International Standard, named the Mobile Multicast Communications
   Protocol (MMCP). The MMCP is a protocol that can be used to support a
   variety of multimedia multicasting services in the IP-based wireless
   mobile networks. The MMCP is targeted at the real-time one-to-many
   multicast services and applications over mobile communications
   networks.

   In MMCP, Session Manager is at the heart of multicast communications.
   It is responsible for overall control by governing the session join
   and handover support operations.

   The MMCP has a characteristic as follows. The MMCP operates on the
   IP-based network. The MMCP easy integrates the existing IP-based
   schemes and protocols required for realization of the MMC services.
   And MMCP has separation of the control channel from the data channel.

3. Protocol Overview

   The MMCP is Mobile Multicast Control Protocol, which is based on the
   Mobile Multicast Communications Framework (MMCF). MMCP designed to
   support one-to-many multicast applications running over multicast-
   capable networks. MMCP operates over IPv4/IPv6 networks that have the
   IP multicast forwarding capability with the help of IGMP and IP
   multicast routing protocols. MMCP considers real-time service and
   handover schemes. MMCP could possibly be provisioned over UDP or TCP.

   A Multicast Contents Server (MCS) transmits multicast data to many
   Mobile Nodes (MNs) using the legacy UDP/IP multicasting. For the
   control purpose of the multicast data transport, a MMCP session is

   established between a Session Manager (SM) and MNs, possibly with one
   or more Local Mobility Controllers (LMCs) between SM and MNs. The SM
   is used to perform the overall control operations for the MMCP
   session, and it shall be interworking with MCS. The LMC is used to
   locally control a part of MNs participating in the session, which is
   for scalability enhancement of the MMCP operations. Each MN
   represents a receiving user for mobile multicast applications.



4. Design Considerations

   This section describes some considerations for the design of MMCP.

4.1. Design Principles

   This section describes the design of the MMCP for MMC services and
   applications over wireless mobile networks as well as the fixed
   communications networks. For this purpose, the MMCP shall be designed
   with the following design principles:

   -  Generic IP-based control schemes for MMC

   -  Easy integration of legacy multicast applications with MMCP

   -  Separation of the control channel from the data channel

   -  Interworking with the conventional protocols for security and
     authentication/authorization

4.2. Functional Entities

4.2.1. Mobile Node (MN)

   A Mobile Node represents a multicast receiving user for the mobile
   multicast application in the MMC networks. A MN will receive the MMC
   services from the Multicast Contents Server (MCS) in the network
   using the MMCP. Each MN may connect to the MMC session from the
   wireless or wired access networks. In either case, the identical MMC
   services will be provided.

4.2.2. Multicast Contents Server (MCS)

   The Multicast Contents Server is a single multicast data sender in a
   MMC session. When a MMC session starts, the MCS will begin to send
   the multicast data to the promising MNs in the network, using IP
   multicast.

Internet-Draft                 <Title>                      August 2009


4.2.3. Session Manager (SM)

   The Session Manager is a functional entity that performs the overall
   control operations for a MMC session. The SM shall be interworking
   with the corresponding MCS for the MMC session. The authentication
   and authorization step for a newly joining MN will possibly be
   implemented by interworking with an appropriate AAA server.

   The SM may be implemented either on the same machine with MCS or
   separately on the different machine. It is noted that the SM and MCS
   perform the different functionality. SM manages the overall control
   functionality for the MMC session, whereas the MCS is the multicast
   sender in the data transport plane.

4.2.4. Local Mobility Controller (LMC)

   For scalability of the MMC functional operations and also for any
   reason of deployment of MMC services, one or more Local Mobility
   Controller may be used for the session. From the functionality point
   of view, the SM and LMC are identical during the session.

   When a MN contacts with the SM to join a MMC session, the SM may
   assign an appropriate LMC to the MN, after processing the session
   join procedure. After that, the MN will now contact with the LMC
   instead of the SM for all of the MMC control operations.

   That is, during the session, the LMC is responsible for the control
   operations (status monitoring and mobility support) through
   interworking with the MNs. The monitored status information on the
   session and MNs will be delivered to the SM.

5. Packets

   A MMCP packet contains a 12-byte base header together with body
   packets.

   In this section, we describe a brief sketch of the MMCP packet format.

5.1. Base Header

   The base header contains the following information:

   Packet Type (8bits)

   It indicates the type of this MMCP packet. The encoding values of the
   MMCP packets are described in Table 1.

   MMCP Version (4bits)

   This field indicates the version of MMCP. At present, the value is
   v.1 (0001).

   MN Length (4bits)

   This value indicates the length of the MMC user identification in
   word. Unit of word is 4-bytes.

   Payload Length (16bits)

   This value indicates the total length of the body in byte, following
   the base header.

   Error Code (6bits)

   It is an error code bit for representation of the MMCP protocol
   error:

   No Error (000000)

   Session Join Reject (000001)

   Monitoring Error (000010)

   Handover Error (000100)

   N (1bit)

   It is a flag bit for new LMC address. The use of this flag depends on
   the packet types:

   For the SJC (Session Join Confirm), the HIC (Handover Initiation
   Confirm) packets, the N is set to 1 indicates that new Local Mobility
   Controller address is exist. N is set to 0, otherwise.

   F (1bit)

   It is a flag bit for confirm message. The use of this flag depends on
   the packet types:

   For the SJC (Session Join Confirm), LJC (Local Join Confirm), ULC
   (User Leave Confirm), HIC (Handover Initiation Confirm) packets, the
   F is set to 1 indicates that each of the corresponding request is
   accepted. F is set to 0, otherwise.

   Reserved (24bits)

   This field is reserved for future use.

   Session ID (32bits)

   This field is used to identify a MMCP session by the Mobile Node. It
   may also be used to verify the session. In the session setup phase,
   this information must first be informed by Session Manager.

6. Procedures

6.1. Session Join

   Session Join is procedure that MN receives multicast content from MCS.
   After Session Join procedure is divided into two scenarios. It is
   that either LMC exist or not.

   First of all, the scenario is that LMC exist as follow. MN sends a
   SJR message to the SM for Session Join. When the SM receives the SJR
   message, the SM identifies an authenticated user from Authentication
   Server (AS) and database. Authentication processing is used by AS and
   DB, which is out of scope.

   If MN is an authenticated user, the SM sends a SJC message that
   includes setting f flag to 1 at base header of packet and MCS, LMC
   information at body of packet. The MN sends a LJR message to address
   of received LMC. After join processing, the LMC sends corresponding
   LJC message to MN. This procedure finishes a Session Join. If MN is
   not an authenticated user, the SM sends a SJC message that includes
   setting f flag to 0 at base header packet only. The Session Join
   procedure is operating Join Waiting Time (JWT). The Session Join
   procedures shall be finished until JWT timer is expired. If JWT timer
   is expired, MN considers that Session Join procedure is failed.

6.2. User Leave

   User Leave is procedure that user leave session when receives content.
   MN sends an ULR message to LMC. After leave processing, the LMC sends
   an ULC message to MN.

6.3. Status Monitoring

   Status Monitoring is procedure for identifying status of the MNs or
   LMCs and checking the handover information. And it sends QoS
   information to upper controller. Status Monitoring is classified two
   scenarios, LMC exist and LMC does not exist.

   First of all, the scenario is that LMC exist as follow. MN sends an
   USR message to the LMC for Status Monitoring. The MN sends
   periodically the USR message to the LMC by Status Report Generation
   Time (SCT) of the MN. When the LMC receives the USR message, the LMC
   sends a SRA message to the MN for response.

   In order to SM has information of MNs, the LMC sends an ASR message
   to the SM. The ASR message is aggregated with information of MNs. The
   LMC also sends periodically the ASR message to the SM by SGT timer of


Kim, Park and Koh     Expires February 20, 2010               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 <Title>                      August 2009


   the LMC. When the SM receives the ASR message, the SM sends a SRA
   message to the LM for response.

   The LMC and SM operate Status Probe Time (SPT). If the LMC does not
   receive an USR message from the MN or the SM does not receive an ASR
   message from the LMC by expired SPT timer, the LMC or SM will send
   the USP message to the MN or LMC. If the responding USR or ASR
   message has not arrived until RXT timer expires, the LMC or SM
   retransmit USR or ASR message. The MN or LMC regards termination, if
   MN or LMC does not response for four sending USR or ASR message.

6.4. Mobility Support

   In handover operation, the MN will send a HIR message to old LMC and
   waits for the HIC message until the Handover Waiting Time (HWT)
   expires. The old LMC sends a HIP message to the MN and finds new LMC
   for the information of the MN to transmit. The old LMC sends a HCT
   message to new LMC and waits for the HTA message until the RXT timer
   expires. The new LMC updates transmitted information of the MN from
   old LMC, and then sends a HTA message to old LMC. The old LMC
   receives the HTA message, then sends the HIC message to the MN if the
   responding HIC message has not arrived until HWT timer expires, the
   MN may send the HIR message again. And if the responding HTA message
   has not arrived until RXT timer expires, the old LMC may send the HCT
   message again.

   The MN will send a LJR message to the new LMC and waits for the LJC
   message until the RXT timer expires. When the new LMC received the
   LJR message, the new LMC sends an ASR message to the SM at next
   transmission time. The SM updates modified information of the new LMC,
   and then sends a SPA message to the new LMC.



7. Conclusions

   This document describes the Mobile Multicast Communications Protocol
   (MMCP). The MMCP is a protocol that can be used to support a variety
   of multimedia multicasting services in the IP-based wireless mobile
   networks. The MMCP is targeted at the real-time one-to-many multicast
   services and applications over mobile communications networks. The
   MMCP benefits are that the MMCP is integrated with legacy multicast
   applications and used for separation the control channel from the
   data channel.
