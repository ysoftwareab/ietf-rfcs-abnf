        Abstract 
         
        This document contains requirements for a framework for transport of 
        IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS 
        has been widely accepted not only for providing digital TV services, 
        but also as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks. One 
        example is the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), specified by standards 
        published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute 
        (ETSI).  
         
        The document identifies the need for the definition of a set of 
        network protocols to standardise the interface between the MPEG-2 
        Transport Stream and an IP subnetwork. It also suggests an optimised 
        encapsulation method for IP datagrams. The requirements for these 
        functions are described, and a framework proposed for their 
        implementation.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB        May 2002        
      
        1. Introduction 
         
        This document identifies requirements for a framework for transport 
        of IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG2].  The 
        framework is also designed to be compatible with services  based on 
        MPEG-2, for example the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) architecture, 
        the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) system [ATSC; ATSC-
        G], and other similar MPEG-2 based transmission systems. Such 
        systems typically provide unidirectional (simplex) physical and link 
        layer standards, and have been defined for a wide range of physical 
        media (e.g. Terrestrial TV [ETSI-DVBT; ATSC-PSIP-TC], Satellite TV 
        [ETSI-DVBS; ATSC-S],Cable Transmission [ETSI-DVBC; ATSC-PSIP-TC]).

        Although many MPEG-2 systems carry a mixture of types of data, MPEG-
        2 components may, and are, also used to build IP-only networks.  In 
        this case, standard system components offer advantages of mass 
        market and improved interoperability.  Such networks often do not 
        implement all parts of a DVB / ATSC system, and may for instance 
        support minimal, or no, signalling of Service Information (SI) 
        tables.  
         
        1.1 TS Logical Channels 
         
        The service provided by a MPEG-2 transport multiplex offers a number 
        of parallel TS Logical Channels.  Each MPEG-2 TS logical channel is 
        uniquely identified by the Packet ID, PID, value carried in the 
        header of each MPEG-2 TS Packet. The PID value is a 13 bit field 
        and, thus, the number of channels is limited to 8192, some of which 
        are reserved for transmission of SI tables. Non-reserved TS Logical 
        Channels may be use to carry audio [ISO-AUD], video [ISO-VID], IP 
        packets [ISO-DSMCC;ETSI-DAT;ATSC-DAT], or other data [ISO-

        DSMCC;ETSI-DAT; ATSC-DAT]. The value 8191 indicates a null packet, 
        used to maintain the physical bearer bit rate when there are no 
        other MPEG-2 TS Packets to be sent.  
         
        Similarities in the way PIDs are used may be observed with the 
        operation of virtual channels in ATM, however, unlike ATM, a PID 
        defines a unidirectional broadcast channel and not a point-to-point 
        to link; there is, as yet, no specified interface for connection 
        setup, or for signalling mappings of IP flows to PIDs, or to set the 
        Quality of Service, QoS, assigned to an MPEG-TS Logical Channel. 
         
        1.2 MPEG-2 Transmission Networks 
         
        Packet data for transmission over the MPEG-2 transport multiplex is 
        passed to an encapsulator.  This  receives Sub-Network Data Units, 
        SNDUs (Ethernet frames or IP packets and formats each SNDU into a 
        series of TS Packets adding an encapsulation header and trailer. 
        (See section 5). This forms a TS. 
         
        There are many possible topologies for the MPEG-2 Transmission 
        Network.  
         
        In a simple example, one or more TS are processed by a MPEG-2 
        multiplexor resulting in a TS Multiplex. That is forwarded over a 
        physical bearer towards one or more receivers. 
         
        In a more complex example, the same TS may be fed to multiple MPEG-2 
        multiplexors and these may, in turn, feed other MPEG-2 multiplexors 
        (remultiplexing). Remultiplexing may occur in several places. One 
        example is a satellite that provides on-board processing of the TS 
        packets, multiplexing the TS Logical Channels received from one or 
        more up-link physical bearers (TS Multiplex) to one (or more in the 
        case of broadcast/multicast) down-link physical bearer (TS 
        Multiplex).  
         
        In all cases, the final result is a "TS Multiplex" which is 
        transmited over the physical bearer towards the receiver. 
         
        To receive IP packets sent over a MPEG-2 transport multiplex, a 
        receiver needs to identify the specific TS Multiplex (physical link) 
        and also the TS Logical Channel (i.e. PID value of a logical link). 
        It is common for a number of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels to carry  
        SNDUs, and the receiver must therefore filter (accept) IP packets 
        sent with a number of PID values, and must independently reassemble 
        each SNDU.  
         
        A system that simultaneously receives from several TS Logical 
        Channels, may utilise receiver hardware to filter unwanted TS 
        Logical Channels. Packets for one IP flow (i.e. a specific 
        combination of IP source and destination addresses) must be sent 
        using the same PID. It should not be assumed that all IP packets are 
        carried on a single PID, multiple PIDs must be allowed. Most

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB        May 2002        
      
        receivers currently have a limit on the maximum number of active 
        PIDs (e.g. 32), although if needed, future systems may reasonably be 
        expected to support more.  In some cases, receivers may need to 
        select TS Logical Channels from a number of simultaneously active TS 
        Multiplexes. To do this, they need multiple physical receive 
        interfaces (e.g. RF front-ends and demodulators). Some applications 
        also envisage the concurrent reception of IP Packets over other 
        media not using MPEG-2 transmission.  
         
        Bi-directional (duplex) transmission can be provided in the DVB 
        framework by using one of a number of alternate return channel 
        schemes [DVB-RC]. Duplex IP paths may also be supported using non-
        DVB return links. One example of such an application is that of Uni-
        Directional Link Routing, UDLR [RFC3077]. 
         
        The DVB family of standards currently defines a mechanism for 
        transporting an IP packet, or Ethernet frame using the Multi-
        Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) [ETSI-DAT]. This scheme is also 
        supported in ATSC [ATSC-DAT; ATSC-DATG]]. It allows transmission of 
        IP packets or Ethernet_style frames in the control plane associated 
        with audio/video transport.  It includes a set of optional header 
        components and requires decoding of the control headers.

        The complete MPEG-2 transmission network may be managed by a 
        transmission service operator. In such cases, the assignment of 
        addresses and TS Logical Channels at receivers are usually under the 
        control of the service operator.  Examples osf this include a TV 
        distribution network, or ISP offering an Internet service to her 
        customers.  MPEG-2 transmission networks are also used for private 
        networks. These typically involve a smaller number of terminals and 
        do not require the same level of centralised control as a managed 
        network. Examples of this include companies wishing to link DVB-
        capable routers to form links within an Internet subnetwork.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB        May 2002        
      
        The framework proposed in this document describes a set of protocols 
        designed to allow IP packets to be sent over an MPEG-2 TS Logical 
        Channel. Since most MPEG-2 transmission networks are bandwidth-
        limited, this needs to be simple, robust, and have good link 
        efficiency (i.e. small overhead) when transporting variable sized IP 
        packets.  The document also identifies the need for supporting 
        protocols (e.g. to support operation and configuration of the link, 
        provide resolution of the MPEG-2 TS Logical Channel, error 
        reporting, etc).  
         
        The framework may also be applicable to other subnetworks utilizing 
        the MPEG-2 TS, and also similar links (e.g. other MPEG-2 
        transmission networks, regenerative satellite links [ETSI-BSM]).

        framework and associated standards for the transmission of video, 
        audio, and data, using the ISO MPEG-2 standard. 
         
        DSM-CC: Digital Storage Management Command and Control [ISO-DSMCC]. 
        A formatting defined by the ISO MPEG-2 standard, which is carried in 
        an MPEG-2 private section. 
         
        DVB: Digital Video Broadcast [ETSI-DVB]. A set of framework and 
        associated standards for the transmission of video, audio, and data, 
        using the ISO MPEG-2 standard. 
         
        ENCAPSULATOR: A network device which receives Ethernet frames or IP 
        packets, and formats these for output as a transport stream of TS 
        Packets. 
          
        FORWARD DIRECTION: The dominant direction of data transfer over a 
        network path. Data transfer in the forward direction is called 
        "forward transfer".  Packets travelling in the forward direction 
        follow the forward path through the IP network. 
         
        MAC: Medium Access and Control of the Ethernet IEEE 802 standard of 
        protocols (see also NPA). 
         
        MPE: Multiprotocol Encapsulation [ETSI-DAT]. A scheme that  
        encapsulates Ethernet frames or IP Packets, creating a  
        DSM-CC Section. The Section will be sent in a series of TS Packets  
        over a TS Logical Channel. 
         
        MPEG-2: A set of standards specified by the Motion Picture Experts 
        Group (MPEG), and standardized by the International Standards 
        Organisation (ISO) [ISO-MPEG]. 
         
        NPA: Network Point of Attachment. Addresses primarily used for 
        station (receiver) identification within a local network (e.g. IEEE 
        MAC address). 
         
        PID: Packet Identifier. A 13-bit field carried in the header of all 
        MPEG-2 Transport Stream packets [ISO-MPEG]. This is used to identify 
        the TS Logical Channel to which it belongs. A PID of 8191 indicates 
        a null packet that must be discarded by a receiver.  
         
        REVERSE DIRECTION: The direction in which feedback control messages 
        generally flow (e.g. acknowledgments of a forward TCP transfer 
        flow). Data transfer could also happen in this direction (and it is 
        termed "reverse transfer").

        PRIVATE SECTION: A syntactic structure used for mapping all service 
        information (e.g. an SI table) into TS Packets.  A table may be 
        divided into a number of sections.  All sections of a table must be 
        carried over a single TS Logical Channel. 
         
        SI TABLE: Service Information Table. In this document, the term is 
        used to describe any table used to convey information about the 
        service carried in a TS Multiplex (e.g. [ISO-MPEG]). SI tables are 
        carried in MPEG-2 private sections.  
         
        TS: Transport Stream [ISO-MPEG], a method of transmission at the 
        MPEG-2 level using TS Packets; it represents level 2 of the ISO/OSI 
        reference model. See also TS Logical Channel and TS Multiplex. 
      
        TS LOGICAL CHANNEL: A channel identified at the MPEG-2 level; it 
        represents level 2 of the ISO/OSI reference model. All packets sent 
        over a channel carry the same PID value 
         
        TS MULTIPLEX: A set of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels sent over a single 
        common physical bearer (i.e. a link transmitting at a specified 
        symbol rate, FEC setting, and transmission frequency). 
      
        TS PACKET: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over an MPEG-2 
        multiplex [ISO-MPEG]; it corresponds to the cells, of e.g. ATM 
        networks, and is frequently also referred to as a TS_cell.  Each TS 
        Packet carries a 4B header, plus optional overhead including 
        pointers to the next payload header, encryption details and time 
        stamp information to synchronise a set of Transport Streams. Each TS 
        packet carries a PID value to associate it with a single TS Logical 
        Channel.

     3. Motivation 
         
        This section describes existing solutions and the need for a new 
        framework. This framework may be used over a link in the forward 
        and/or the reverse direction. The protocols to be supported are: 
         
        (i)    IPv4 Unicast packets, destined for a single end host 
        (ii)   IPv4 Broadcast packets, sent to all end systems in an IP 
               network 
        (iii)  IPv4 Multicast packets 
        (iv)   IPv6 Unicast packets, destined for a single end host 
        (v)    IPv6 Multicast packets 
        (vi)   Packets with compressed IPv4 / IPv6 packet headers (e.g. 
               [RFC1114;RFC2507;RFC3095]) 
      
         
        Three issues are addressed by this framework:  
         
        (i)    Providing an efficient encapsulation scheme that may be 
               easily implemented in an encapsulator or receiver.  
         
        (ii)   Existing standards do not define how an IP node should 
               associate a particular IP address with a TS channel (PID, TS 
               Multiplex). Bindings are required for both unicast 
               transmission, and multicast reception. In this document, 
               these are referred to as IP address resolution issues.  
         
        (iii)  Existing standards do not address many areas which are 
               desirable for Internet Service provision, (e.g. network 
               management, the communication required to support Internet 
               QoS, support for auto-configuration, multi-homing and 
               mobility). 
         
      
        The following principles are suggested for this work: 
         
        (i)    Ubiquity.  The framework operates below the IP network layer. 
               It must not require modifications to existing implementations 
               of IP (IPv4 or IPv6), UDP, TCP. 
         
        (ii)   Minimal overhead.  The framework should minimize protocol 
               overhead, in terms of the number of additional bytes to be 
               sent in addition to the IP packet and processing overhead in 
               terms of parsing effort of variable length headers or options 
               fields (see iv).  This is important for bandwidth-limited 
               systems (such as satellite, terrestrial radio/TV links). 
         
        (iii)  Minimal set of required options.  Reducing the number and 
               type of optional parameters reduces the receiver processing 
               overhead.  Importantly, it also simplifies receiver 
               implementation, allowing easier implementation and promoting 
               better interoperability between vendor implementations. The

               header format currently adopted by MPE known to be not 
               optimal for IP, incurring significant receiver processing 
               overhead and extra link overhead [CLC99]. 
         
        (iv)   Maximum Throughput. The framework should offer minimal 
               transmit/receive processing load. In some cases, the use of 
               header compression may represent a useful trade-off in 
               increased processing overhead, but reduced packet header 
               size. In some cases (e.g., to meet the QoS delay requirement 
               of a flow) efficiency at the MPEG-2 TS level may have to be 
               sacrificed for reduced transit delay.  
         
        (v)    Flexibility. The framework should provide sufficient 
               flexibility to allow future inclusion of other mechanisms for 
               specific applications (e.g., synchronisation with other MPEG-
               2 TS Channels). There is also need for the framework to 
               operate over the range of MPEG-2 multiplexes in the forward 
               direction, and the diverse range of return channel systems in 
               the reverse direction. 
         
        (vi)   Compatibility. If new protocols are defined by the framework, 
               it is desirable that they allow co-existence with existing 
               schemes, such as MPE, to allow continued use of the broad-
               base of existing equipment. 
         
        (vii)  Scalability. The framework must be efficient when used in 
               both large and small networks.  The size of a network using 
               MPEG-2 transport may range from a pair of nodes, to one 
               including millions of receivers.  
         
      
        The specified framework and techniques to be developed may also be 
        suited to non-DVB systems employing the MPEG-2 TS, or other 
        (sub)networks offering similar transfer capabilities.

     4. Framework for the IP Service. 
         
        This section describes the requirements for transporting IPv4 and 
        IPv6 over MPEG-2 transmission networks. The section identifies key 
        needs and provides examples of mechanisms that may be used to 
        implement these. 
         
        (i)    The framework should offer guidance on which MPEG-2 features 
               are pre-requisites for this service, and any optional fields 
               that impact performance/correct operation.  
         
        (ii)   The framework must be robust to software failures and link 
               loss.  
      
        (iii)  TS Logical Channel Resolution. There is a need to signal the 
               PID and TS Multiplex that is associated with each IP flow to 
               the network layer at the sender and receiver.  To make such 
               schemes robust to loss and state changes within the MPEG-2 
               transmission network, a soft-state approach may prove 
               desirable.  This could, for example, be implemented via 
               descriptors sent in the SI tables (using the MPEG-2 control 
               plane), or in-band by a protocol using a data channel (e.g. 
               similar to the A       R
                               ddress  esolution Protocol, ARP). 
         
        (iv)   IPv4 and IPv6. The framework must support IPv4 and IPv6 
               network protocols. The payload encapsulation requires a type 
               field for the SNDU to indicate the type of packet. 
      
        (v)    Compressed Headers. The framework must address the need for 
               the support of header compression schemes. This requires the 
               encapsulation to have a type field for each SNDU. 
      
        (vi)   Multicast. The framework must support IP multicast 
               transmission of IPv4 and IPv6 packets. IPv4  network 
               broadcast must also be supported. 
      
        (vii)  Diffserv and QoS.  The mapping of QoS functions should be 
               addressed. This includes how such fields as IP QoS/DSCP and 
               RSVP should be mapped to the under-lying MPEG-2 TS.  
      
        (viii) Security. The framework must permit use of IPSEC and clearly 
               identify any security issues concerning the specified 
               protocols. The security issues need to consider two cases: 
               unidirectional transfer (in which communication is only from 
               the sending IP end host to the receiving IP end host) and bi-
               directional transfer.  Consideration should also be given to 
               security of the TS Multiplex: the need for closed user groups 
               and the use of MPEG-2 TS encryption. 
      
        (ix)   Management. There may be a need for standardised SNMP MIBs 
               and error reporting procedures. The need for and scope of 
               this is to be determined.

     5. Motivation for a Lightwight Protocol Encapsulation 
         
        To transmit packet data over an MPEG-2 transmission network requires 
        that individual SNDUs (e.g. IPv4, IPv6 packets, or bridged Ethernet 
        Frames) are encapsulated using a convergence protocol. The following 
        encapsulations are currently standardised for MPEG-2 transmission 
        networks: 
         
        (i)     Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE). 
               The Multi-Protocol Encapsulation, MPE, specification of DVB 
               [ETSI-DAT] uses private Sections for the transport of IP 
               packets and usesencapsulation thatt is similar to the IEEE 
               LAN/MAN standards [LLC]. Data packets are encapsulated in 
               datagram_sections that are compliant with the DSMCC_section 
               format for private data.  
         
               This encapsulation makes use of a MAC-level network point of 
               attachment address. Theaddress format conforms to the 
               ISO/IEEE standards for LAN/MAN LLC]. The 48-bit MAC_address 
               field contains the MAC address of the destination; it is 
               distributed over six 8-bit fields, labeled MAC_address_1 to 
               MAC_address_6. The MAC_address_1 field contains the most 
               significant byte of the MAC address, while MAC_address_6 
               contains the least significant byte.  How many of  
               these bytes are significant is optional and defined by the 
               value of the broadcast descriptor table [SI-DAT] sent 
               separately over another MPEG-2 TS within the TS multiplex. 
         
               MPE is currently the most widely used scheme. Due to 
               investments in existing equipment, usage is likely to 
               continue in some applications in current and future networks. 
         
        (ii)   Data Piping. 
               The DVB Data Piping profile [ETSI-DAT] is a minimum overhead, 
               simple and flexible profile that makes no assumptions 
               concerning the format of the data being sent. In this 
               profile, the MPEG-2 receiver is intended to provide PID 
               filtering, packet reassembly according to [DVB-SIDAT-368], 
               error detection and optionally CA support.  
         
               The specification allows the user data stream to be 
               unstructured or organized into packets. The specific 
               structure is transparent to the receiver. It may conform to 
               any protocol, e.g., IP, Ethernet, NFS, FDDI, MPEG-2 PES, etc. 
         
        (iii)  Data Streaming. 
               The data broadcast specification profile [ETSI-DAT] for PES 
               tunnels (Data Streaming) supports unicast and multicast data 
               services that require a stream-oriented delivery of data 
               packets. This encapsulation maps an IP packet into a single 
               PES Packet payload Data Streaming is intended to handle a 
               single stream of data at a high data rate using standard

               demultiplexing ICs (e.g. developed for STBs) that have been 
               designed for handling video streams. Transporting data 
               packets using the PES level offers the benefits of PES layer 
               functions integrated into the chip sets, e.g. handling of 
               program specific information (tables), scrambling and 
               synchronization with other TS. 
         
               The standard PES Packet as defined in table 2-18 of [ISO-
               MPEG] can also be used as a container for data packets. The 
               two values for the stream_id are _private_stream_1_ and  
               _private_stream_2_. The private_stream_2 permits the use of 
               the short PES header with limited overhead. This makes it 
               attractive for publicly accessible multicast distribution 
               services. The private_stream_1 makes available the scrambling 
               control and the timing and clock reference features of the 
               PES layer. The PES_data_packet_header_length will be used in 
               this context to insert stuffing bytes. This is an important 
               aspect since the payload can be aligned to 32-bit word 
               boundaries. 
         
               When the data_identifier field is used in conjunction with 
               the first 4 bits of the sub_stream_id field it forms a 12 bit 
               field. This carries a descriptor of the next level protocol. 
               The list of protocol codes will be managed by [EUTELSAT], and 
               the values of the part stored into the data_identifier field 
               will be in the range 0x80-0xFF (assigned by DVB as user 
               defined). The remaining 4 bits of the sub_stream_id field are 
               used for storing the current version of the encapsulation 
               format. 
         
         
        Some or all of these proposals have been implemented and are used in 
        current systems.

     6. Convergence Protocol Requirements 
         
        A convergence protocol typically adds header fields that are placed 
        before the SNDU, and carry protocol control information (e.g., the 
        length of the SNDU, addresses, multiplexing information, payload 
        type identification, sequence numbers).  The SNDU is typically 
        followed by a trailer, which carries an Integrity Check (e.g., 
        Cyclic Redundancy Check, CRC). Some protocols add additional control 
        information and/or padding to the trailer. 
                                           
               +--------+-------------------------+-----------------+ 
               | Header |            SNDU         | Integrity Check | 
               +--------+-------------------------+-----------------+

                       packet) to form an MPEG-2 Payload Unit. 
         
        Examples of existing convergence protocols include ATM AAL5, and 
        MPEG-2 MPE. This section describes existing standard encapsulations 
        used with MPEG-2 transmission networks. The section also reviews the 
        requirements for performing an encapsulation optimised for IP. 
         
        The existing proposals and standards for use with MPEG-2 (described 
        in section 5) all introduce considerable overhead.  This consumes 
        link capacity and receiver processing power. The then current state 
        of chip technology played an important role in defining these 
        encapsulations and it may be argued that there was little previous 
        implementation experience considered. Arguably, too much 
        consideration was paid to existing digital video/audio technology 
        and too little to Internet protocol aspects. 
         
        6.1 Header Overhead 
         
        The fixed 184 byte payload size of a TS Packet also introduces a 
        bandwidth overhead due to the padding (or stuffing) commonly 
        employed when placing data in the TS Packets.  
      
        One common application is the use of a DVB-S multiplex to provide 
        the forward link for satellite delivery of IP data.  In many current 
        applications the forward data traffic over the satellite link is 
        mostly data with a packet size 1500 bytes. This overhead is 
        approximately 2-11%. Short IP packets, (e.g., carrying control 
        information (e.g. ICMP, IGMP, and TCP ACK packets), can lead to a 
        much more overhead (up to approximately 500% for IPv4), if they are 
        carried individually in a TS Packet. IP header compression (e.g. 
        [RFC3095]), would offer no benefit in this case. 
         
        To alleviate this problem, some implementers have made use of the 
        Payload_Unit_Start_Indicator (PUSI) to carry a pointer.  The PUSI 
        pointer may be used to indicate the presence of a second payload 
        unit within a single TS Packet. This allows a second payload unit

        to directly follow the end of the first, in a procedure sometimes 
        called Packing. 
         
        Note, an under-run of data at the IP Encapsulator may cause a TS 
        Packet to be sent for which would have less than 184 bytes of 
        payload. Such a Packet will need to be padded to the standard 
        payload size of 188 bytes. 
         
        6.2 TS Multiplexing 
      
        Most current MPEG-2 multiplexers are forward TS Packets, using a 
        stream-based design. They do not usually flush their buffers, but 
        store TS Packets until an input buffer fills to a threshold, 
        (assuming that the data arrives in a more or less continuous 
        stream). This assumption is not necessarily valid for IP packets, 
        which tend to arrive in intermittent traffic bursts.  The forwarding 
        behaviour of the multiplex can lead to significant link transit 
        delays for the last packet(s) in a traffic burst. 
         
        Various solutions to this problem are possible including: 
        (i)    Flushing an IP packet stream with null TS Packets after each 
               traffic burst. 
        (ii)   Redesign of the TS multiplexer buffer management to control 
               the maximum queuing latency for IP traffic flows. 
        (iii)  Addition of a new push identifier that lets the TS  
               multiplexer identify the end of a traffic burst. 
         
        This also raises a configuration option, in the specification of the 
        maximum holding time.  This could be configured based on well-known 
        requirements (such as a function of the ACK_Delay interval in TCP), 
        but could also be based QoS metric derived for the IP traffic being 
        carried. The IP-DVB framework must identify how this is to operate 
        and specify appropriate values for parameters. 
         
        6.3 Convergence Functions  
         
        Carrying IP packets over a TS involves several  convergence protocol 
        functions, in particular (i) delimiting the payload unit i.e. the 
        SNDU, (ii) identifying the size of payload, (iii) conveying control 
        and signalling information between sender and receiver process, and 
        (iv) naming and addressing the recipient. 
         
        (i)    Payload_Unit Delimitation 
               The start of a payloads may be delimited by alignment with 
               lower layer framing (e.g. aligning data with the start of an 
               MPEG-2 TS Packet or ATM Cell), or via a unique delimiter 
               sequence (e.g. the HDLC or PPP Flag symbol) .   
         
               Use of a delimiting sequence requires a transparency 
               procedure to ensure the sequence does not appear in the 
               payload data (e.g. bit stuffing in HDLC and byte-stuffing in 
               PPP).

               MPEG-2 indicates the start of a payload unit in a new TS 
               Packet with a "start_of_payload_unit_indicator" [ISO-MPEG]. 
               The PUSI is a 1 bit flag that has normative meaning 
               [ISO_MPEG] for TS Packets that carry PES Packets or PSI data.  
                
               When the payload of a TS Packet contains PES Packet data, the 
               PUSI value is '1' to indicate the payload of this TS Packet 
               starts with the first byte of a PES Packet. A value of '0' 
               indicates that no PES Packet starts in this TS Packet. If the 
               PUSI is set to '1', then one, and only one, PES Packet starts 
               in the TS Packet.  
                
               When the payload of the TS Packet contains PSI data, the PUSI 
               value of '1' indicates the first byte of the TS Packet 
               payload carries a pointer_field that indicates the position 
               of the first byte of the Section being carried; if the TS 
               Packet does not carry the first byte of a PSI section, the 
               PUSI is set to '0', indicating that there is no pointer_field 
               in the TS Packet payload.  
                
               Using this PUSI bit, the start of the first payload_unit in a 
               TS Packet is exactly known by the receiver, unless that TS 
               Packet has been corrupted or lost in the transmission. In 
               which case, the payload is discarded until the next TS Packet 
               is received with a PUSI value of '1'. 
         
               The encapsulation should allow packing of more than one SNDU 
               into the same TS Packet. It should not limit the number of 
               SNDUs that can be sent in a TS Packet.  In addition, it 
               should allow an IP Encapsulator to insert padding when there 
               is an incomplete TS Packet payload. A mechanism needs to be 
               identified to differentiate this padding from the case where 
               another encapsulated SNDU follows.  
         
               A combination of the PUSI and a Length Indicator (see below) 
               allows an efficient MPEG-2 convergence protocol to receive 
               accurate delineation of packed SNDUs.  The MPEG-2 standard 
               [ISO_MPEG] however does not define how private data may use 
               the PUSI bit.  
         
        (ii)   Length Indicator 
               The end of a payload_unit is signalled directly in some 
               protocols (e.g. by the absence of a carrier in Ethernet, by 
               the presence of a delimiting sequence in HDLC/PPP, or by a 
               marker bit in AAL5). Most services using MPEG-2 include a 
               length field in the payload header to allow the receiver to 
               identify the end of the payload unit (e.g. PES Packet, 
               Section). 
         
               When parts of more than two payload units are carried in the 
               same TS Packet, only the start of the first is indicated by

               the PUSI pointer. Placement of the length indicator in the 
               encapulation header allows a receiver to determine the number 
               of bytes until the start of the next encapsulated SNDU. This 
               placement also provides the opportunity for the receiver to 
               pre-allocate an appropriate-sized memory buffer to receive 
               the reassembled SNDU. 
         
               A length indicator is required, and should be carried in the 
               encapsulation header.  This should support SNDUs of at least 
               the MTU size offered by Ethernet (1500 bytes). Although the 
               IPv4 and IPv6 packet format permits an IP packet of size up 
               to 64 KB, such packets are seldom seen on the current 
               Internet. Since high speed links are often limited by the 
               packet forwarding rate of routers, there has been a tendency 
               for Internet core  routers to support MTU values larger than 
               1500 bytes. A value of 16 KB is not uncommon in the core of 
               the current Internet.  This would seem a suitable maximum 
               size for an MPEG-2 transmission network. 
         
        (iii)  Next level Protocol Type 
               There is a common need to identify the type of payload being 
               transported (e.g., to differentiate IPv4, IPv6, arp messages, 
               and compressed packet headers). Most protocols use a type 
               field to identify a specific process at the next higher layer 
               that is the originator or the recipient of the payload 
               (SNDU). This method is used by IPv4, IPv6, and also by the 
               original Ethernet protocol (DIX). OSI uses the concept of a 
               'Selector' for this, (e.g. in the IEEE 802/ISO 8802 standards 
               for CSMA/CD [LLC], although in this cased a SNAP (subnetwork 
               access protocol) header is also required for IP packets). 
                
               The MPE encapsulation header does not directly include a type 
               field (e.g., to differentiate IPv4 and IPv6 packets).  If 
               such support is required, an option must be specified in the 
               MPE encapsulation header to indicate the addition of an LLC 
               header, and this must in turn be followed by a SNAP header. 
               This introduces considerable overhead. 
         
               A Next Level Protocol Type field is also required when Robust 
               Header Compression (ROHC) is used. The ROHC framework defines 
               a number of header compression techniques which may yield 
               considerable improvement in throughput on links which have a 
               limited capacity. Since many MPEG-2 transmission networks are 
               wire-less (e.g., satellite, terrestrial TV, line of sight 
               microwave) the ROHC framework will be directly applicable for 
               many applications. Use of ROHC implies the need to transfer 
               smaller SNDUs and the need for additional processing at the 
               receiver to expand the received compressed packets. 
         
               It is desirable therefore to include a Next Level Protocol 
               Type field in the encapsulation header.  Such a field should 
               specify values for at least IPv4, IPv6, and ROHC (e.g.

               [RFC3095]). It is also desirable to allow for other values 
               (e.g., MAC-level bridging). 
         
        (iv)   Addressing 
               In the MPEG-2 system the PID carried in the TS Packet header 
               is used to identify individual services with the help of SI 
               tables. This was primarily intended as a unidirectional 
               (simplex) broadcast system. A TS Packet stream carries either 
               one table or one PES Packet stream (i.e., compressed video or 
               audio). Individual receivers are not addressable at this 
               level. 
                
               IPv4 and IPv6 allocate addresses to end hosts and 
               intermediate systems (routers). Each system (or interface) is 
               identified by a globally assigned address.  ISO uses the 
               concept of a hierarchically structured Network Service Access 
               Point (NSAP) address to identify an end user process in an 
               Internet environment.  
                
               Within a local network a completely different set of 
               addresses for the Network Point of Attachment (NPA) is used; 
               frequently these NPA addresses are referred to as Medium 
               Access Control, MAC-level addresses. In the Internet they are 
               also called hardware addresses. Whereas network layer 
               addresses are used for routing, NPA addresses are primarily 
               used for station (receiver) identification.  
         
               Receivers may use the NPA of a received SNDU to reject 
               unwanted unicast packets within the interface drive of the 
               receiver, but must also perform forwarding checks based on 
               the network level IP level address. IP multicast and 
               broadcast may also filter based on the NPA, but must also 
               filter unwanted packets at the network layer based on source 
               and destination IP addresses.  This does not imply that each 
               IP address must map to a unique NPA (more than one IP address 
               may map to the same NPA). If a separate NPA address is not 
               required, the network layer address is sufficient for both 
               functions. L3 Ethernet switching devices can recognise the 
               destination network layer addresses (often with the 
               assistance of hardware) and perform fast line-rate 
               filtering/forwarding based on IPv4 / IPv6 addresses. 
               Multicast filtering/forwarding can also be performed in this 
               way using a combination of the IP source and destination 
               addresses. 
                
               If it is required to address an individual receiver in an 
               MPEG-2 transport system, this can be achieved either at the 
               network level (IP address) or via a hardware-level NPA 
               address (MAC-address).  If both addresses are being used, 
               they must, be mapped either in a static or a dynamic way 
               (e.g., by an address resolution process), a similar

               requirement may also exist to identify the PID and TS 
               multiplex on which services are carried.  
         
               Using an NPA address in a MPEG-2 transport system may be seen 
               to enhance security, in that a particular payload may be 
               targeted for a particular receiver by specifying the receiver 
               NPA address. This is however only a weak form of security, 
               since the NPA filtering is often reconfigurable (frequently 
               performed in software), and may be modified by a user to 
               allow reception of specified (or all packets), similar to 
               promiscuous mode operation in Ethernet. If security is 
               required, it should be applied at another place (e.g. link 
               encryption, IPSEC, transport level security and/or 
               application level security). 
         
               MPE defines a NPA destination address in the convergence 
               header. No NPA source address is present.  There are cases 
               where an IP service has no need for NPA addresses, in this 
               case these add unnecessary processing and transmission 
               overhead, and should not be included in the encapsulation  
               header.   
         
               There are cases where the use of a NPA is desirable and if 
               present this should be carried in encapsulation header where 
               it may be used by receivers as a pre-filter to discard 
               unwanted SNDUs. The addresses allocated does not need to 
               conform to the IEEE MAC address format, and there may 
               therefore be a good case for allowing the use of a reduced 
               (smaller than an IEEE MAC address) NPA. There are many cases 
               where a NPA is not required, and network layer filtering may 
               be used. A new encapsulation protocol should therefore 
               support an optional NPA and may allow for future 
               specification of the size of NPA. 
         
        (v)    Integrity Check 
               There should be a small (or negligible) probability of an 
               undetected packet error [LINK-ID]. There is therfore a need 
               for a CRC to verify correctness of a received IP packet. Such 
               checks should be sufficient to detect incorrect operation of 
               the encapsulator and receiver (including reassembly errors 
               following loss/corruption of TS Packets), in addition to 
               protecting from loss and/or corruption by the transmission 
               network (e.g., multiplexors and links). 
         
               Mechanisms exist in MPEG-2 transmission networks that may 
               assist in detecting loss (e.g. the 4-bit continuity counter 
               included as standard in the MPEG-2 TS Packet header).  
         
               A convergence protocol should use an encapsulation that 
               provides a strong integrity check. For ease of hardware 
               implementation, this check should be carried in a trailer 
               following the SNDU. A CRC-32 is sufficient for operation with

               up to a 12 KB payload, and may still provide adequate 
               protection for larger payloads. 
         
        6.4 Encapsulation Efficiency 
         
        To evaluate the performance of different encapsulation methods, a 
        measure has to be found to provide a ranking. The volume of data 
        transmitted for additional tables and descriptors should be omitted 
        because PSI information and system tables are immanent to the 
        MPEG2/DVB transmission scheme and have nothing to do with actual 
        data transmission. In this section the following ranking is used: 
         
             Efficiency = Sum of transferred bytes / Payload size 
          
        The goal is to reach a number close to 1.0. However, by using an 
        MPEG-2 TS for transmission the theoretical minimum is 1.0217. This 
        overhead is caused by the 4 byte header for each 188 byte TS Packet. 
         
        MPE utilizes DSM-CC private sections for conveying IPv4 packets. The 
        section mechanism generates at least 17 bytes per IPv4 packet (16 
        bytes for the datagram section and 1 byte for the PUSI pointer 
        field). This excludes the LLC/SNAP field which is optional and not 
        required in all cases. Depending on the implementation (i.e., the 
        use of Pacing) it is possible that one TS Packet may contain 
        multiple sections (e.g. the end of one section and the start of 
        another one). 
         
        A mimumum encapsulation requires the following fields: Frame Length; 
        Payload Type; and Integrity Check. In addition the PUSI field would 
        be required in TS Packets that carry the first byte of an 
        encapsulated SNDU.  
         
      
     7. Supporting Protocols 
         
        Information about the set of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels carried over 
        a TS Multiplex is usually distributed via tables (service 
        information, SI) sent using channels assigned a specific (well-
        known) set of PIDs. This system was originally designed for 
        audio/video distribution to set-top-boxes.  The design requires 
        access to and processing of the SI table information (which is 
        carried in DSM-CC section format [ISO_DSMCC]).  This scheme is 
        complex, and reflects the complexity of delivering and co-ordinating 
        the various TS Logical Channels associated with a multimedia TV 
        programme. There is no direct support for IP mechanisms for 
        identification of the TS multiplex and PID in use for a particular 
        IP address.  
         
        One possible approach to provide TS multiplex and PID information 
        for IP services is to integrate additional information into the 
        existing MPEG-2 tables, or to define additional tables specific to 
        the IP service.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB        May 2002        
      
         
        Another alternate approach is to carry this information over the a 
        TS data channel, (e.g. using a protocol similar to the Service 
        Announcement Protocol, SAP). Implementing this independently of the 
        SI tables, would ease implementation, by allowing it to operate on 
        systems where IP processing is performed in a software driver. It 
        may also allow the technique to be more easily adapted to other 
        similar delivery networks. It also is advantageous for networks 
        which use the MPEG-2 TS but links, but do not necessarily support 
        audio/video services and therefore do not need to provide full 
        interoperability with TV equipment (e.g. links used solely for 
        connecting IP (sub)networks). 
         
        A final possible approach is to design a query/response protocol 
        (like ARP) which operates over an MPEG-2 TS Logical Channel using a 
        previously agreed PID (e.g. configured, or communicated using a SI 
        table). 
         
        Work in this area includes: 
         
        (i)    Request by a sender to associate a PID with an IP flow. 
        (ii)   Request by a sender to establish a QoS association for a PID 
               carried over the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
        (iii)  Indication of the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex capabilities to 
               configure the upstream IP sender.  
        (iv)   Indication to the IP receiver of the PID and TS Multiplex 
               that should be used for reception of IP packets from a 
               particular address. 
        (v)    Definition of a MIB to provide standard management of the IP 
               subnetwork using SNMP. 
         
        The IP address resolution support may also be suited for use with 
        other IP over MPEG-2 encapsulations (e.g., MPE [ETSI-DAT]). As part 
        of address resolution, there is also a need to signal whether MPE or 
        an IETF encapsulation is used. 
         
         
     8. Multicast Support 
         
        This section addresses specific issues concerning IPv4 and IPv6 
        multicast over MPEG-2 Transmission Networks.  
         
        These issues include, but are not restricted to: 
         
        (i)    Encapsulating multicast packets for transmission using a 
               MPEG-2 TS. 
        (ii)   Mapping IP multicast groups to the underlying MPEG-2 TS 
               Logical Channel (PID) and the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
        (iii)  Provide signalling information to allow a receiver to locate 
               an IP multicast flow within an MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
        (iv)   Determining group membership (e.g. utilising IGMP/MLD).  
        (v)    Error Reporting.

        Appropriate procedures need to be specified to identify the correct 
        action when the same multicast group is available on separate TS 
        Logical Channels.  This could arise when different end hosts act as 
        senders to contribute IP packets with the same IP group destination 
        address. Another different case arises when a receiver may 
        potentially receive more than one copy of the same packet.  In some 
        cases, these may be sent in different TS Logical Channels, or even 
        different TS Multiplexes. 
         
        The primary goal of multicast support will be efficient filtering of 
        IP-multicast packets by the receiver, and the mapping of IPv4 and 
        IPv6 multicast addresses onto the associated PID value and TS 
        Multiplex.  The design should permit a large number of active 
        multicast groups, and should minimise the processing load at the 
        receiver when filtering and forwarding IP multicast packets. For 
        example, schemes that may be easily implemented in hardware would be 
        beneficial, since these may relieve the drivers and operating 
        systems from discarding unwanted multicast traffic. 
         
      
     9. Evaluation of IP Service over DVB networks 
         
        A set of methodologies may be defined to assist in the evaluation of 
        the protocols defined by this framework. These could define 
        terminology, evaluation criteria (utilisation, throughput, loss 
        rate, undetected error rate, etc), and may specify tests to indicate 
        the impact of such parameters as IP Packet size, IP version, 
        multicast/unicast, and rate of transmission.  A set of test cases 
        could also be defined to allow performance to be quantitatively 
        measured and compared. 
      
         
     10. Summary 
         
        This document proposes a framework for defining a set of protocols 
        to perform efficient and flexible support for IP network services 
        over networks built upon the MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS).   
         
        This document describes the encapsulation required to transfer IPv4 
        and IPv6 packets over an MPEG-2 transmission network. 
        The current encapsulation methods for IP packets have been outlined, 
        together with guidelines on the requirements for developing a new 
        encapsulation. The framework will support IP packet transmission   
        using the Multiprotocol Encapsulation (MPE), which is widely 
        implemented, and in addition, a new optimised encapsulation 
        procedure. Support for compression is also a key element in this 
        proposed framework. 
         
        The framework also includes one or more new MPEG-2 TS Logical 
        Channel resolution procedures to allow dynamic configuration of the

        sender and receiver using an MPEG-2 link.  These will support IPv4 
        and IPv6 services in both the unicast and multicast modes 
         
      
     11. Security Considerations 
         
        The normal security issues relating to the use of wire-less links 
        for transport Internet traffic should be considered.
