                New IPv6 Multicast Address for Switch ML
                      draft-hsingh-ipv6-coin-ml-00

Abstract

   Recently, in-network aggregation to scale distributed machine
   learning (ML) has been presented.  A network switch implementation
   uses IPv4 broadcast messages from switch to the hosts to send updates
   to all workers.  IPv6 does not support broadcast addresses.  This
   document proposes, IPv6 implementations use the IPv6 link-local all-
   nodes multicast address to receive messages from a switch, until a
   new link-local multicast address is assigned by IANA for switch to
   hosts multicast communications for switch machine learning
   algorithms.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   New computing in the network algorithms
   (https://p4.org/assets/P4WS_2019/
   Speaker_Slides/7_1145am_Jacob_Nelson.pdf), for IPv6, have a need for
   multicast communication between network switch and host worker nodes.
   This document proposes a new well-known multicast address be defined
   for such communications.  Until a new address is defined, the link-
   local all-nodes multicast address may be used.  By definition, a
   layer-2 switch operates in the link-local subnet.  Thus, the IPv6
   link-local address defined by this document suffices for switch to
   host multicast communications.

   If a switch is configured in layer-3 mode, then IPv6 global multicast
   addresses will have to be used.  Layer-3 mode of a switch is
   currently out of scope of this document.

3.  Security Considerations

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document proposes to use "FF02:0:0:0:0:0:1:8" link-local
   multicast address for use by network ML.  This multicast address name
   is Switch_ML_Host.  An interface on the host MUST join this well-
   known multicast address.
