Abstract

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP-for-IPv4) option for nodes that implement the Intra-Site
   Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).

1. Introduction

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   [RFC2131] option for the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
   Protocol [ISATAP]. The option encodes configuration information used
   by clients to initialize the Potential Router List (PRL) as specified
   in [ISATAP], section 7.3.1. The option format is similar to [RFC3361]
   and allows the server to publish one or more domain names or IPv4

   addresses.

2. Requirements

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

3. ISATAP DHCP Option

   The ISATAP DHCP option encodes a list of one or more 32-bit IPv4
   addresses or DNS [RFC1035] fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs). The
   elements in the list MUST NOT include a mix of IPv4 addresses and
   FQDNs; instead, the data type is identified by an encoding byte in
   the DHCP option. The ISATAP DHCP option encodes a sequence of octets
   using the following format:

    Code   Len   enc      Potential Router List
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   | TBD |  n  | 0/1 |  p1 |  p2 |  p3 |  p4 | p5  | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   In this format, the DHCP option code is followed immediately by a
   'Len' octet that indicates the total number of octets that follow,
   including the 'enc' octet.

   When 'enc' = 0, the list contains a sequence of labels comprising one
   or more FQDN encoded exactly as specified in [RFC1035], section 3.1.
   (Note: this is the same format specified by [RFC3361], section 3.1).
   As an example, if the server wants to advertise the FQDNs
   "isatap.com" and "isatap.net", it would be encoded as follows:

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |TBD| 25| 0 | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'n'|'e'|'t'| 0 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   When 'enc' = 1, the list contains one or more IPv4 addresses. In this
   case, 'Len' MUST be a minimum of 5 and a multiple of 4 plus one.
   (Note: this is the same format specified by [RFC3361], section 3.2).
   The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format:

    Code   Len   enc   Address 1               Address 2
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   | TBD |  n  |  1  | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a1  |  ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   Clients use the elements encoded in the ISATAP DHCP option to
   initialize the Potential Router List as specified in [ISATAP],
   section 7.3.1.

4. IANA considerations

   A new DHCPv4 option number for ISATAP is requested.

5. Security considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131] apply.
