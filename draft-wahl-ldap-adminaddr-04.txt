Internet-Draft    LDAP Administrator Address Attribute     November 2006


Abstract

   Organizations with multiple or outsourced directory servers need the
   ability for administrators to determine who is responsible for a
   particular directory server.  This document defines an attribute with
   contact information for a directory server's responsible party,
   conceptually similar to the 'sysContact' object of SNMP, which can be
   retrieved from the directory server using the Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol.

Internet-Draft    LDAP Administrator Address Attribute     November 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an attribute type, administratorsAddress, for
   use in LDAP [1] directory deployments.

   The values of this this attribute are used to provide contact
   information of the responsible party for an LDAP server, or of the
   responsible party for a naming context within a LDAP server.

   This attribute is intended to be used by management tools that are
   LDAP clients.  For example, a management tool for checking the state
   of a replication or referral topology might use this attribute to
   send email to the manager of a particular server when it detects an
   error.

   (This attribute type was originally defined in the mid-1990s for
   inclusion in the LDAPv3 data model, but was omitted from the LDAPv3
   root DSE specification as there was only one implementation of a
   server supporting that attribute at that time.)

   The words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY" are used as defined in RFC 2119
   [2].

   Please send comments to the author at mark.wahl@informed-control.com.

2.  The administratorsAddress attribute

   The attribute type is defined as follows (with lines wrapped for
   readability):

     ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.101.120.1 NAME 'administratorsAddress'
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
      USAGE directoryOperation )

   Attributes of this type can contain one or more values, and each
   value is a URI [3].  Each URI is encoded using the IA5 string syntax
   [4].

   Unlike the labeledURI attribute [6], these values do not have a
   label.

   In existing practice, this URI can be of the 'mailto:' form
   identifying a personal or role email address, such as
   "mailto:helpdesk@example.com".

   To obtain the responsible party for a directory server, the attribute
   is read from the root DSE, using a baseObject search requesting this
   attribute by returned, as described in RFC 4512 [5].

   To obtain the responsible party for a naming context, the attribute
   is read from the entry at the base of the naming context, using a
   baseObject search requesting this attribute be returned.  Note that
   these addresses need not be the same as that of the directory server
   administrator, or of a data administrator.

   This document only specifies how a client can read this attribute.
   Some servers MAY support updating this attribute over protocol,
   subject to access control.  Other servers might instead provide this
   value read only, if it is configured through the server's out-of-band
   management interface, such as in a configuration file.

3.  Security Considerations

   The server's access control policy SHOULD allow this information to
   be visible to a suitable administrator in the same organization.
   Since one use of this attribute is to find who is responsible if the
   server is not making authentication decisions properly, a directory
   server configuration SHOULD cause the attribute in the root DSE, if
   present, to be able to be returned in a search response to all users
   who are permitted to access the directory server.  The administrator
   SHOULD choose addresses for use in this attribute that are already
   publicly known within the organization, and SHOULD NOT encode
   passwords or other secret information within the URIs.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The LDAP Parameter registration for this attribute has already been
   reviewed by the Directorate and processed by IANA.  This attribute
   object identifier is registered as follows:


      Descriptor: administratorsAddress

      Object Identifier: 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.101.120.1
