Abstract

   There is a long-term tradition in the Internet community, predating
   the IETF by many years, of use of the RFC series to publish materials
   that are not rooted in the IETF standards process and its review and
   approval mechanisms.  These documents, known a "independent
   submissions", serve a number of important functions for the Internet
   community, both inside and outside of the community of active IETF
   participants.  This document discusses the independent submission
   model, some reasons why it is important, and describes editorial and
   processing norms that can be used for independent submissions as we

Internet-Draft           Independent Submissions              April 2006


1.  Introduction

   There is a long-term tradition in the Internet community, predating
   the IETF by many years, of use of the RFC series to publish materials
   that are not rooted in the IETF standards process and its review and
   approval mechanisms.  These documents, known a "independent
   submissions", serve a number of important functions for the Internet
   community, both inside and outside of the community of active IETF
   participants.  This document discusses the independent submission
   model, some reasons why it is important, and describes editorial and
   processing norms that can be used for independent submissions as we
   go forward into new relationships between the IETF community and its
   primary technical publisher.

   To understand the perspective of this document, it is important to
   remember that the RFC-Editor function predates the creation of the
   IETF.  As of the time of this writing, the RFC series goes back 36
   years while the IETF is celebrating its 20th anniversary.  All of the
   documents that were published before the IETF was created, and for
   some years thereafter, would be considered independent submissions
   today.  As the IETF evolved, the IAB and then the IETF itself choose
   to publish IETF documents as RFCs while fully understanding that the
   RFC-Editor function was an independent publication mechanism.  Other
   decisions were possible: e.g., the IETF could have decided to create
   it own publication series.  It was felt that there was considerable
   value in continuing to publish the IETF work in the same series as
   the one used to publish the basic protocols for the Internet.

1.1.  Terminology Note

   This document describes what have historically been referred to a
   "independent submissions".  That term is distinguished from those
   IETF and IAB community documents that originate from formal groups --
   IAB, IRTF, IETF WGs -- and from submissions submitted to the IESG for
   standards-track, informational, or experimental processing.  The
   latter are known as "individual submissions".

   For convenience and obvious historical reasons, the editor and
   publisher of documents that are not processed through the IETF is
   known below as the "RFC Editor".  That term is not intended to
   predict the future, either in terms of who does the job or what they,
   or the document series, is called.

1.2.  Context and Philosophical Assumptions

   This document is intended to update RFC 3932 [RFC3932] and to
   complement the discussions in the ongoing "TechSpec" effort,
   including the discussion of IETF-originated documents in [Mankin-



Klensin                 Expires October 14, 2006                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Independent Submissions              April 2006


   Techspec].  It takes a somewhat stronger view than those documents,
   starting from the belief that independent submissions are valuable if
   they are, in fact, independent of the IETF process.  From the
   perspective of the IETF, they are especially important as checks on
   the IETF processes even though such checks are not the only, or even
   a common, reason for publication of independent submissions.  That
   role is compromised if IETF-related entities are able to condemn
   documents by attaching language to them that implies that the
   documents are worthless.  This is especially problematic when the
   documents have not been sufficiently reviewed in the IETF to
   determine an IETF consensus about their content.  While the authors
   and contributors to this document are firmly committed to IESG review
   to identify conflicts with the standards process and suggestions that
   would cause serious harm to the Internet, as outlined in RFC 3932 and
   RFC 2026 [RFC2026], they believe that the IETF should condemn, as
   distinct from issuing general warnings about the lack of formal IETF
   review, only those things about which there is IETF consensus about
   harm.


2.  The Role of Independent Submissions

   When the RFC series was fairly new, RFCs could be used to publish
   general papers on networking as well as the types of documents we
   would describes as standards today.  Those roles also developed as
   part of the early design and development of the ARPANET, long before
   anyone dreamt of the IETF and when the distinction between, e.g.,
   standards and informational documents was less precisely drawn.  In
   more recent years, independent submissions have become important for
   new reasons.  They include:

   o  Discussion of Internet-related technologies that are not part of
      the IETF agenda.
   o  Introduction of important new ideas as a bridge publication venue
      between academia and IETF engineering.
   o  Informational discussions of technologies, options, or experience
      with protocols.
   o  Informational publication of vendor-specific protocols.
   o  Critiques and discussions of alternatives to IETF standards-track
      protocols.  The potential for such critiques provides an important
      check on the IETF's standards processes and should be seen in that
      light.
   o  Documents considered by IETF Working Groups but not standardized.
      These documents are published for the historical record.
   o  Satirical materials.
   o  Meeting notes and reports (RFC 164 [RFC0164] is the earliest, 1109
      [RFC1109] the most important).

Internet-Draft           Independent Submissions              April 2006


   o  Editorials (the best example is IEN-137, not an RFC).
   o  Eulogies (RFC 2441 [RFC2441])
   o  Technical contributions (e.g., RFC 1810 [RFC1810]) and,
      historically,
   o  IANA Policy Statements (e.g., RFC 1591 [RFC1591]), at least prior
      to the June 2000 MOU [RFC2860].

   It should be clear from the list above that, to be effective, the
   review and approval process for independent submissions should be
   largely independent of the IETF.  As a important principle that has
   been applied historically, the RFC Editor should seek advice from the
   IESG about possible relationships and conflicts with IETF work.  The
   IESG may ask that publication of particular documents be deferred, as
   a courtesy, because their untimely publication could cause confusion
   or other harm with proposals under consideration for standardization
   and, absent compelling arguments to the contrary, the RFC Editor will
   honor such requests.  Similarly, any submission that constitutes an
   alternative to, or is in conflict with, an IETF Standard or proposal
   for standards-track adoption must clearly indicate that relationship.
   The IESG may identify such conflicts or, after doing a technical
   review, conclude that the document describes a protocol or technique
   that would cause operational damage to the Internet.  In those cases,
   the IESG may recommend explanatory or qualifying text for the RFC
   Editor to include in the document if it is published.

   However, in no case should qualifying text go beyond these general
   principles.  In particular, no text supplied by the IESG should
   indicate that the independent submission is technically deficient or
   should not be taken seriously unless there has been an IETF technical
   review that has reached consensus on that conclusion.

   The specific procedures to be followed in review are described in
   Section 4.


3.  Submission

   Independent submissions are submitted directly to the RFC Editor.
   They must first be posted as Internet Drafts, so the submission is
   typically simply a note requesting that the RFC Editor consider a
   particular Internet Draft for publication.  The process is described
   in more detail in [RFC2223] and a working draft of an update to it
   [RFC2223bis].


4.  Review

   The IESG, in [RFC3932], specified its view of its role in the review

Internet-Draft           Independent Submissions              April 2006


   process for independent submissions.  Based on informal discussions
   in the IETF, this document updates that one slightly.

   The steps in the review process are as follows:

4.1.  Posting of Draft

   The author(s) or editor(s) of a document post it as an Internet
   Draft.

4.2.  Request for Publication

   After an opportunity for community review and feedback on that draft,
   the editor sends a request for consideration for publication to the
   RFC Editor at rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org.

4.3.  Initial RFC Editor Review

   RFC Editor staff perform an initial check on the document.  If they
   believe there is a high likelihood of conflicts or other interactions
   with IETF efforts (including believing that the document is one that
   the IESG should probably process), they may forward it to the IESG,
   or relevant ADs, for preliminary evaluation and comment.

4.4.  Document Rejection

   If the document does not appear publishable, the RFC Editor may
   reject a submitted document at any point in the process specified
   here if they conclude that the submissions does not meet the
   technical or editorial standards of the RFC Series or is not relevant
   to the areas that the series covers.  Alternatively, the RFC Editor
   may, at their discretion, iterate with the author on the document to
   improve its quality.  If a document is rejected by the RFC Editor,
   the author may request an additional review from the IAB, as
   described below, but the IAB is not obligated to do that review, nor
   is the RFC Editor obligated to publish even with a favorable IAB
   review.

4.5.  Review and Evaluation

   The RFC Editor arranges for one or more reviews of the document.
   This may include Editorial Board evaluation of the reviews.  Unless
   there is some substantive reason to not do so, these reviews will be
   made public and posted on the RFC Editor web site.  The author may
   request that the reviews be kept private and the request to publish
   their document be withdrawn.

   This section does not preclude private communications between

Internet-Draft           Independent Submissions              April 2006


   reviewers, the Editorial Board, and the RFC Editor; such
   communications will remain confidential.  At minimum, the author
   shall receive a written summary of the review(s).

   Independent of whether the reviews are public, reviewers are allowed
   to be anonymous at their request.

4.6.  Unsolicited Reviews

   Unsolicited reviews from parties independent of the author, including
   IESG members acting in their individual capacities, are welcome at
   any time and will be handled as above.

4.7.  Additional Reviews

   If the author is unsatisfied with the review(s), the author may
   request that the RFC Editor solicit additional reviews.  In
   exceptional circumstances, the author may request that the IAB review
   the documents.  Such requests to the IAB, and any reviews the IAB
   chooses to perform, will occur according to procedures of the IAB's
   choosing.  However, the IAB is not required to initiate a review.
   The RFC Editor is expected to consider all competent reviews
   carefully, and in the absence of some unusual circumstance, a
   preponderance of favorable reviews should lead to publication.

4.8.  Formal IESG Review

   Once the RFC Editor has made a tentative decision to publish, the
   document is forwarded to the IESG for evaluation with a relatively
   short timeout.

   The IESG evaluation is not a technical one.  Instead, it covers the
   issues outlined above in Section 1.2 and listed in RFC 3932.  That
   is, the evaluation should focus exclusively on conflicts or confusion
   with IETF process, end runs around working group activities, and
   obvious and significant harm to the Internet.

   At the time the document is forwarded to the IESG, the RFC Editor
   will post an indication on its web pages that the document is under
   IESG review and that comments on conflicts or harm can be sent to the
   IESG with copies to the RFC Editor and other comments may be sent to
   the author(s) and RFC Editor.

   If the IESG, after completing its review, concludes that publication
   of the document should be delayed for a reasonable period of time,
   the RFC Editor will grant that request.  The current agreement
   between the RFC Editor and the IESG on these delays is expected to
   continue.  That agreement permits the IESG to ask for a delay of up



Klensin                 Expires October 14, 2006                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Independent Submissions              April 2006


   to six months and, if necessary, to renew that request twice, for a
   total possible delay of 18 months.

   If the IESG concludes that the document should not be published as an
   RFC, it will request that the RFC Editor not publish, providing
   appropriate justification.  The RFC Editor will review the request to
   not publish the document.

   The RFC Editor or the author may appeal the IESG's request to delay
   or not publish to the IAB.  Such an appeal will be made public via
   the RFC Editor web site.

4.9.  Final Decision and Notification

   In all cases, the ultimate decision to publish or not publish, and
   with what language, rests with the RFC Editor.

   Information about the IESG requested publication delay or request to
   not publish a document will be posted to the RFC Editor's web site to
   supplement document status information.

4.10.  Intellectual Property Rights

   IPR provisions for independent submissions are as specified in the
   material on RFC Editor submissions in BCP 78 [RFC3978] although that
   material should eventually be migrated into a successor of this
   document.

4.11.  Final Editing and Publication

   Once a document is approved for publication, it is handled in a
   fashion similar to other RFCs, with principles about priorities
   worked out with the IAB as appropriate.


5.  The Editorial Review Board

   The RFC Editor appoints and maintains an Editorial Review Board
   which, much like the Editorial Boards of professional journals and
   publishers, provides the RFC Editor with both general advice and
   advice and reviews of particular proposed publications.  The
   membership list of the Editorial Review Board is public and can be
   found at http://www.rfc-editor.org/edboard.html.  From time to time,
   the RFC Editor will solicit suggestions for new appointees from the
   IAB and other sources and will seek IAB comments on those to be
   appointed.  However, to ensure the independence of the independent
   submission process, the final decision to appoint (or not appoint)
   Editorial Board members rests with the RFC Editor.
