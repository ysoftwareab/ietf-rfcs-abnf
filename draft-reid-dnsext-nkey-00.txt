2.  Introduction

   The DNS protocol is defined in RFC1034[1], RFC1035[2] and clarified
   in RFC2181[3].  The scope for using DNS KEY Resource Records was
   limited in RFC3445[4] to keys used by the Domain Name System Security
   Extensions (DNSSEC) which is defined in RFC4033[5], RFC4034[6] And
   RFC4035[7].  The original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC
   keys and arbitrary application keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and
   application keys with the same record type is a mistake so RFC3445
   removed application keys from the KEY record by redefining the
   Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data.  This means that any other
   uses of keying material in the DNS need to define a new RRtype and
   mnemonic.

   This document advocates the introduction of a new resource record
   specifically to provide this type of information for keys that
   encrypt NAPTR records [8].  A scheme for encrypting NAPTR records is
   outlined in draft-timms-encrypt-naptr [9].

3.  Definition of NKEY Resource Record

   The NKEY RR uses an IANA-assigned type code and is used as resource
   record for storing keys which encrypt NAPTR records.  The RDATA for a
   NKEY RR consists of flags, a protocol octet, the algorithm number
   octet, and the public key itself.  The format is as follows:

   NKEY RDATA format


                   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              flags            |   protocol    |   algorithm   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               /
   /                        public key                             /
   /                                                               /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   All bits of the flags field are reserved and MUST be zero.  The
   protocol field MUST be set to 1.  The algorithm and public key fields
   are identical to the definitions used in RFC4034 [6].

4.  Security Considerations

   The format and correct usage of DNSSEC keys is not changed by this
   document and no new security considerations are introduced.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to issue a new type code and mnemonic for the
   proposed resource record.  No other IANA services are required by
   this document.
