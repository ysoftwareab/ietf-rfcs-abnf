                   ROHC profile for GTP-U compression
                  draft-lei-tsvwg-gtpu-compression-00

Abstract

   This document specifies the comoression profile for IP/UDP/GTP-U
   header chain.

   ROHCv1 profiles [RFC 5795, RFC 4815] efficiently compress RTP/UDP/IP
   (Real-Time Transport Protocol, User Datagram Protocol, Internet
   Protocol), RTP/UDP-Lite/IP (User Datagram Protocol Lite), UDP/IP,
   UDP-Lite/IP, IP and ESP/IP (Encapsulating Security Payload) headers.

   The second version of the above profiles [ROHCv2] introduces a number
   of simplifications to the rules and algorithms that govern the
   behavior of the compression endpoints.  It also defines robustness
   mechanisms that may be used by a compressor implementation to
   increase the probability of decompression success when packets can be
   lost and/or reordered on the ROHC channel.  The ROHCv2 profiles
   define their own specific set of header formats, using the ROHC
   formal notation [RFC 4997].

   To compress the defined GTP-U header chain uses the ROHCv2 mechanism
   as mentioned above.

Internet-Draft              GTP-U compression             September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The ROHC WG has developed a header compression framework on top of
   which various profiles can be defined for different protocol sets or
   compression requirements.  The ROHC framework was first documented in
   [RFC3095], together with profiles for compression of RTP/UDP/IP
   (Real-Time Transport Protocol, User Datagram Protocol, Internet
   Protocol), UDP/IP, IP and ESP/IP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
   headers.  Additional profiles for compression of IP headers [RFC3843]
   and UDP-Lite (User Datagram Protocol Lite) headers [RFC4019] were
   later specified to complete the initial set of ROHC profiles.

   The updated version of the above profiles are developed and
   documented [RFC 5225], using the ROHC formal notation [RFC 4997].

   This document defines a compressed profile for IP/UDP/GTP-U header
   chain, using the ROHCv2 [RFC 5225] mechanism, which inturn used the
   ROHC formal notation [RFC 4997].

   3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) defined GPRS Tunnelling
   Protocol (GTP) which can be decomposed into separate protocols,
   GTP-C, GTP-U and GTP'.  GTP-U is, in effect a relatively simple IP
   based tunneling protocol which permits many tunnels between each set
   of end points.

   The separate tunnels are identified by a TEID (Tunnel Endpoint
   Identifier) in the GTP-U messages, which should be a dynamically
   allocated random number.  If this random number is of cryptographic
   quality, then it will provide a measure of security against certain
   attacks.  Even so, the requirement of the 3GPP standard is that all
   GTP traffic, including user data should be sent within secure private
   networks, not directly connected to the Internet.  This happens on
   UDP port 2152.

   The compression of the extension headers is same as the mechanism
   developed in ROHCv2 [RFC 5225].

   The usage of this profile is defined in 3GPP specification for UMTS
   [3GPP TS29.281] and LTE [3GPP TR 36.806]

   As per the 3GPP specification, IP/UDP/GTP-U header chain encapsulates
   application layer headers over the protocol stack over Un interface.
   The typical applications running over Un interface are most
   considered as voice over IP applications which are carried and
   managed by RTP/RTCP protocol over outer IP/UDP headers.

   Therefore, at the Un interface, IP/UDP/RTP header chain which is also
   called as inner IP header chain which is the dominated application of

   operators are responsible to carry voice over IP type application,
   and, private transport protocol (GTP-U) which is also called as IP/
   UDP/GTP-U outer IP header chain encapsulates inner IP header chain.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document is consistent with the terminology found in the ROHC
   framework [RFC4995] and in the formal notation for ROHC [RFC4997].


3.  Acronyms

   This section lists most acronyms used for reference, in addition to
   those defined in [RFC4995 & RFC 3095].

   GTP -- GPRS Tunnelling Protocol

   GTP-C -- GTP Control Plane

   GTP-U -- GTP User Plane


4.  Background (Informative)

   This section provides background information on the compression
   profile defined in this document.  The fundamentals of general header
   compression [RFC 5225] and of the ROHC framework may be found in
   sections 3 and 4 of [RFC4995], respectively.  The fundamentals of the
   formal notation for ROHC are defined in [RFC4997].

4.1.  Classification of Header Fields

   Section?.1 of [RFC4995] explains that header compression is possible
   due to the fact that there is much redundancy between field values
   within the headers of a packet, especially between the headers of
   consecutive packets.

   Appendix A lists and classifies in detail all the header fields
   relevant to this document.  The appendix concludes with
   recommendations on how the various fields should be handled by header
   compression algorithms.

   The main conclusion is that most of the header fields can easily be



zhu & Maguluri            Expires March 5, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              GTP-U compression             September 2010


   compressed away since they never or seldom change.

   For GTP-U, the Sequence Number (SN) is optional.  First we should
   check the inner header chain, whether the inner header has RTP header
   or not.  If RTP header is present, the RTP-SN act as MSN otherwise
   the compressor generates a 16-bit sequence number SN which increases
   by one for each packet received in the packet stream.

4.2.  Control Field

4.2.1.   Master Sequence Number (MSN)

   The Master Sequence Number (MSN) field is either taken from a field
   that already exists in one of the headers of the protocol that the
   profile compresses (e.g., RTP SN from the inner header), or
   alternatively it is created at the compressor.  There is one MSN
   space per context.

   The MSN field has the following two functions:
   o  Differentiating between reference headers when receiving feedback
      data;
   o  Inferring the value of incrementing fields (e.g., IPv4
      Identifier).

   There is one MSN field in every ROHCv2 header, i.e., the MSN is
   always present in each header type sent by the compressor.  The MSN
   is sent in full in IR headers, while it can be lsb encoded within CO
   header formats.  The decompressor always includes LSBs of the MSN in
   the Acknowledgment Number field in feedback (see Section 6.9).  The
   compressor can later use this field to infer what packet the
   decompressor is acknowledging.

   For profiles for which the MSN is created by the compressor (i.e.,
   GTP-U if the inner header chain does not have RTP header), the
   following applies:
   o  The compressor only initializes the MSN for a context when that
      context is first created or when the profile associated with a
      context changes;
   o  When the MSN is initialized, it is initialized to a random value;
   o  The value of the MSN SHOULD be incremented by one for each packet
      that the compressor sends for a specific CID.

4.3.  Compressed Header Chain

   Some header types use one or more chains containing sub-header
   information.  The function of a chain is to group fields based on
   similar characteristics, such as static, dynamic, or irregular
   fields.

Internet-Draft              GTP-U compression             September 2010


   Chaining is done by appending an item for each header to the chain in
   their order of appearance in the uncompressed packet, starting from
   the fields in the outermost header.

   In the text below, the term "protocol_name" is used to identify
   formal notation names corresponding to different protocol headers.

   The mapping between these is defined in the following table:


        +----------------------------------+---------------+
        | Protocol                         | protocol_name |
        +----------------------------------+---------------+
        | GTP-U                            | gtpu          |
        +----------------------------------+---------------+


4.4.  Header Formats and Encoding Methods [TBD]

4.5.  Encoding Methods with External Parameters as Arguments [TBD]

4.6.  Header Formats

4.6.1.  Packet types

   ROHC profile for IP/UDP/GTP-U uses several different packet types:
   the Initialization and Refresh (IR) packet type and the Compressed
   (CO) packet type.

   Each packet type defines a number of packet formats: two packet
   formats are defined for the IR type and two sets of eight base header
   formats are defined for the CO type with one additional format that
   is common to both sets.

   The profile identifier for ROHC-GTP is 0xXXXX.

4.6.2.  Initialization and Refresh (IR) Packets

   ROHC profile for IP/UDP/GTP-U uses the basic structure of the ROHC IR
   and IR-DYN packets as defined in [RFC4995] (Sections 5.2.2.1 and
   5.2.2.2, respectively).

   Packet type: IR This packet type communicates the static part and the
   dynamic part of the context.

   For the ROHC profile of IP/UDP/GTP-U IR packet, the value of the x
   bit MUST be set to '1'.  It has the following format, which
   corresponds to the "Header" and "Payload" fields described in Section

   context.

   The general format for a compressed TCP header is as follows, which
   corresponds to the "Header" and "Payload" fields described in Section
   5.2.1 of [RFC4995]:

   CO packet format

   Base header: The complete set of base headers is defined in Section
   xxxx.

   Irregular chain: See Section xxxx and Section xxxx.

   Payload: The payload of the corresponding original packet, if any.
   The presence of a payload is inferred from the packet length.

1.  Detailed Classification of Header Fields

   Header compression is possible due to the fact that most header
   fields do not vary randomly from packet to packet.  Many of the
   fields exhibit static behavior or change in a more or less
   predictable way.  When designing a header compression scheme, it is
   of fundamental importance to understand the behavior of the fields in
   detail.

   In this appendix, all fields in the headers compressible by these
   profiles are classified and analyzed.  The analysis is based on
   behavior for the types of traffic that are expected to be the most
   frequently compressed (e.g., RTP field behavior is based on voice
   and/or video traffic behavior).

   Fields are classified as belonging to one of the following classes:
   o  INFERRED - These fields contain values that can be inferred from
      other values, for example the size of the frame carrying the
      packet, and thus do not have to be included in compressed packets.
   o  STATIC - These fields are expected to be constant throughout the
      lifetime of the flow; in general, it is sufficient to design a
      compressed format so that these fields are only updated by IR
      packets.
   o  STATIC-DEF - These fields are expected to be constant throughout
      the lifetime of the flow and their values can be used to define a
      flow.  They are only sent in IR packets.
   o  STATIC-KNOWN - These fields are expected to have well-known values
      and therefore do not need to be communicated at all.
   o  SEMISTATIC - These fields are unchanged most of the time.
      However, occasionally the value changes but will revert to its
      original value.  For ROHCv2, the values of such fields do not need
      to be possible to change with the smallest compressed packet
      formats, but should be possible to change via slightly larger
      compressed packets.
   o  RARELY CHANGING (RACH) - These are fields that change their values
      occasionally and then keep their new values.  For ROHCv2, the
      values of such fields do not need to be possible to change with
      the smallest compressed packet formats, but should be possible to
      change via slightly larger compressed packets.
   o  IRREGULAR - These are the fields for which no useful change
      pattern can be identified and should be transmitted uncompressed
      in all compressed packets.
   o  PATTERN - These are fields that change between each packet, but
      change in a predictable pattern.

   Current GTP-U packet format

   Version field: This field is used to determine the version of the
   GTP-U protocol.  The version number shall be set to '1'.  This field
   contains static parameter in a series of GTP-U messages.

   Protocol Type (PT): This bit is used as a protocol discriminator
   between GTP (when PT is '1') and GTP' (when PT is '0').  GTP-U header
   should always use '1' as the value of this parameter.  This field
   contains static parameter in a series of GTP-U messages.

   Extension Header flag (E): This flag indicates the presence of a
   meaningful value of the Next Extension Header field.  This field
   contains static parameter in a series of GTP-U messages.

   Sequence number flag (S): This flag indicates the presence of a
   meaningful value of the Sequence Number field.

   N-PDU Number flag (PN): This flag indicates the presence of a
   meaningful value of the N-PDU Number field.  This field contains
   static parameter in a series of GTP-U messages.

   Message Type: This field indicates the type of GTP-U message.  This
   field contains static parameter in a series of GTP-U messages.

   Length: This field indicates the length in octets of the payload,
   i.e. the rest of the packet following the mandatory part of the GTP
   header (that is the first 8 octets).  The Sequence Number, the N-PDU
   Number or any Extension headers would be considered to be part of the
   payload, i.e. included in the length count.
