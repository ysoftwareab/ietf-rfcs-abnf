Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines Textual Conventions to represent commonly
   used Path Computation Element (PCE) management information.  The
   intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and
   used in PCE related MIB modules to avoid duplicating conventions.

Internet-Draft               PCE-TC-STD-MIB               September 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines Textual Conventions to represent commonly
   used Path Computation Element (PCE) management information.  The
   intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and
   used in PCE related MIB modules to avoid duplicating conventions.

   For an introduction to the concepts of PCE, see [RFC4655].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL", when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This MIB module defines PCE common SMI items.  It defines the nodes
   for the homing of the MIB modules and TC to be imported and used in
   PCE related MIB modules.

   PCE management information is arranged into 3 modules:
   o  PCE-TC-STD-MIB (defined in this memo) defined the root for homing
      Standard PCE MIB modules;
   o  PCE-DISC-STD-MIB defines the management information for monitoring
      PCE entities discovery;

      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION
         "The LDP identifier is a six octet quantity which is used to
         identify a PCE client."
      SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..6))

   PceRoutingDomainID ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION
         "A PCE-DOMAINS information element or a A PCE-DEST-DOMAINS
         information element carries the identifier of a routing domain
         (area, as) which type depends on both the routing protocol and
         on the version of Internet protocol in use in this routing
         domain.

         This TC defines a common SMI type for the different kinds of
         routing domain identifiers.

         A PceRoutingDomainID value is always interpreted within the
         context of an AddressFamilyNumbers value.  Every usage of the
         PceRoutingDomainID textual convention is required to specify
         the AddressFamilyNumbers object which provides the context.

         The value of an PceRoutingDomainID object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated
         AddressFamilyNumbers object.

         Following is the mapping between AddressFamilyNumbers type and
         PceRoutingDomainID size:
            ipV4(1):
               PceRoutingDomainID is an InetAddressIPv4 corresponding to
               the name of an OSPF area;
            ipV6(2):
               PceRoutingDomainID is an InetAddressIPv6 corresponding to
               the name of an OSPF area;
            nsap(3):
               PceRoutingDomainID type is OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..20)),
               corresponding to the name of an ISIS area (see RFC 1195);
            asNumber(18)
               PceRoutingDomainID type is OCTET STRING (SIZE (2))
               corresponding to the name of an Autonomous System.
         "
      SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..20))

6.  Security Considerations

   This module defines only textual conventions.  As security
   considerations can only be written in MIB modules that define
   management objects this document has no impact on the security of the
   Internet.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment for pceStdMIB under
   the mib-2 branch.

   PCE related standards track MIB modules should be homed under the
   pceStdMIB subtree.  This document also requests IANA to assign {
   pceStdMIB 1 } to the PCE-TC-STD-MIB specified in this document.
