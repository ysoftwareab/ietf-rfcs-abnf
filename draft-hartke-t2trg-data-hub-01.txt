1.  Introduction

   In Thing-to-Thing communication, there is often a need to share data
   items of common interest at a central location.  For example, the
   CoRE Resource Directory [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] aggregates
   descriptions of resources held on other servers, which enables things
   to easily discover these resources.  Similarly, a W3C Web-of-Things
   Thing Description Repository [WOT] stores semantic metadata of things
   as well as functional descriptions of their interfaces, making this
   data available to Web dashboards, commissioning tools and other
   things.

   As more and more thing-to-thing applications are implemented, it
   becomes increasingly important to be able to share not only resource
   and thing descriptions but also many other kinds of data, such as
   default configurations for new devices, service locations, firmware
   updates, or certificate revocation lists.  The existing resource
   directories and thing description repositories are not a good fit for
   these kinds of data, as they're specialized to their use case and
   don't accept other kinds of data.  And defining a new specialized
   application for each use case is not practical in the long term.

   This document defines a simple "data hub" application, a RESTful Web
   application with a hypermedia API that is suitable for constrained
   environments and that generalizes the concept of a central repository
   for sharing any kinds of data.  A data hub enables clients to share
   data items in any format and provides means for creating, reading,
   observing, updating, deleting and finding data items at a data hub
   server.

   Data hubs are intended to be used primarily with CoAP [RFC7252].

   Features:

   o  General

      The data hub generalizes the concept of a directory or repository
      to data items to any Internet media type.  This means applications
      using the data hub aren't stuck forever with the same media types
      or limited to resource descriptions and thing descriptions.

   o  Searchable

      Clients can retrieve a subset of data items from a data hub based
      on item metadata.

   o  Observable

      Data items published to a data hub are exposed as resources.  As
      such, they can be observed for changes [RFC7641].  This allows
      clients to stay informed of information that other clients update
      over time.  As a result, the data hub functions similar to a CoAP
      Publish-Subscribe Broker [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub], although
      this isn't its primary use case.

   o  Evolvable

      The key differentiator of the data hub compared to CoRE Resource
      Directory and CoAP Publish-Subscribe Broker is the evolvability --
      the ability to respond effectively to the need for changes without
      negatively impacting existing and new clients.  Data hubs enable
      fine-grained evolvability by driving all interactions by machine-
      readable hypermedia elements.  Features can be added, changed or
      removed in a safe, backwards-compatible way simply by updating the
      data hub representation to expose appropriate links and forms.

2.  Data Model

   The data model consists of two elements: the _data hub_ and a number
   of shared _data items_ (Figure 1).

                              ___
                   Data Hub  /   \
                             \___/
                               |         ___
                               |________/   \  Data Item
                               |  item  \___/
                               |         ___
                               |________/   \  Data Item
                               |  item  \___/
                               |                   .
                               |                   .
                               |                   .
                               |         ___
                               |________/   \  Data Item
                                  item  \___/

          Figure 1: A Data Hub with a Number of Shared Data Items

   Data Hub

      A data hub resource is a collection of shared data items.

      Data hub representations MUST be formatted in the "application/
      coral+cbor" or "text/coral" media type [I-D.hartke-t2trg-coral].
      They primarily consist of links to the data items using the "item"
      link relation type [RFC6573].  To reduce the number of round-
      trips, they MAY also embed (complete or partial) representations
      of data items.  Forms contained in the representation enable
      interactions with the hub and data items, as described in the
      following section.  The representations MAY additionally contain
      other links and forms that are not described in this document,
      such as a link with the "alternate" link relation type that
      references an alternate representation of the data hub resource.

      For a start, a data hub is defined to have a depth of only one
      level; i.e., all data item resources are organized directly under
      the top-level data hub resource.  This could be extended to
      multiple levels in a future revision of this document.

   Data Item

      A data item is a member of the collection.

Internet-Draft           Thing-to-Thing Data Hub              March 2018


      Data item representations MAY be formatted in any media type.
      However, a data hub instance MAY restrict the media types it
      accepts for publication.  The form in the data hub representation
      for creating data items MUST list the acceptable media types in
      this case using form fields with name <urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX#accept>.

      The representations of data items MAY link back to a data hub
      resource using the "collection" link relation type [RFC6573].

3.  Interaction Model

   The interaction model consists of eight possible interactions with a
   data hub: discovering and reading the data hub, and creating,
   reading, observing, updating, deleting, and finding shared data items
   in the data hub.

   Discovering a Data Hub

      For a start, this revision of the document assumes that clients
      are pre-configured with a link to a data hub.

   Reading a Data Hub

      A client can retrieve a representation of a data hub by following
      the pre-configured link.  The representation of the data hub
      includes links to (and, optionally, representations of) the data
      items in the data hub.  The data hub representation also includes
      forms for creating, updating, deleting, and finding data items.

   Creating an Item

      The representation of a data hub MAY contain a form with the
      <urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX#create> form relation type.  Submitting this
      form with a representation in one of the acceptable media types
      creates a new data item in the data hub.  The acceptable media
      types are indicated by <urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX#accept> form fields.

      Data hubs implementing this specification MUST offer the POST
      method [RFC7252] in this form.

   Reading an Item

      A client can retrieve a representation of a data item by following
      a link with the <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/item>
      link relation type in the data hub representation.

   Observing an Item

Internet-Draft           Thing-to-Thing Data Hub              March 2018


      A client can observe a data item by following a link with the
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/item> link relation type
      in the data hub representation and observing the target resource
      as specified in RFC 7641 [RFC7641].

   Updating an Item

      For each data item in a data hub, the representation of the data
      hub MAY include a nested form with the <urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX#update>
      form relation type.  Submitting this form updates the data item in
      the data hub to the submitted representation.

      Data hubs implementing this specification MUST offer the PUT
      method [RFC7252] in this form.

   Deleting an Item

      For each data item in a data hub, the representation of the data
      hub MAY include a nested form with the <urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX#delete>
      form relation type.  Submitting this form deletes the data item
      from the data hub.

      Data hubs implementing this specification MUST offer the DELETE
      method [RFC7252] in this form.

   Searching for Items

      The representation of a data hub MAY contain a form with the
      <urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX#search> form relation type.  This form can be
      used to find data items in the data hub.  Submitting this form
      with a search query returns the subset of data items that match
      the query.

      Data hubs implementing this specification MUST offer the FETCH
      method [RFC8132] in this form.

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

Appendix A.  Related Work

   The data hub is an instance of the well-known collection pattern.  As
   such, it might be used in places where a more specialized instance of
   the collection pattern is currently used, such as the CoAP Publish-
   Subscribe Broker [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub] or the CoRE Resource
   Directory [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].  This section shows how
   these two applications might be implemented with a data hub (without
   trying to replicate all of their features in detail).

A.1.  CoAP Publish-Subscribe

   CoAP Publish-Subscribe [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub] provides means for
   resource-constrained sensor and actuator nodes to publish and receive
   data without having to be available at the same time.  The basic
   operation involves clients called "publishers" updating "topic"
   resources at a server called the "broker" and clients called
   "subscribers" observing these resources (Figure 2).

       ____________            ____________            ____________
      |            |--------->|            |          |            |
      |  Publisher |<---------|   Broker   |          | Subscriber |
      |  (Client)  |          |  (Server)  |<---------|  (Client)  |
      |____________|          |____________|--------->|____________|

                     Figure 2: CoAP Publish-Subscribe

   A broker might be implemented as a data hub by creating the topics as
   resources on the data hub server and linking to these from the data
   hub resource (Figure 3).  Hypermedia controls in the data hub
   representation enable publishers to create, update, and delete topics
   as well as subscribers to read or observe these topics.

              Figure 4: A Data Hub Storing Link Format Items

   A data hub might be used to store these resource descriptions.  Each
   resource description becomes a data item in the data hub (Figure 4).
   A specialized interface for querying the cumulative set of stored
   links might be provided separately.
