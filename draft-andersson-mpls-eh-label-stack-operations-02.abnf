stack = [101, VPN, GAL, ACH, HEH, EH, IP]

            Note: this will be forwarded on the standard FEC because
            since the EH is present in the packet, only packet without
            an EH is forwarded on the "no EH present" FEC.

stack = [VPN, GAL, ACH, HEH, EH, IP]

            Note: As E is the penultimate hop it will pop the standard
            LDP label.
