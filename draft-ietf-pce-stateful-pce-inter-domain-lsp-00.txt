               Cooperative Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) 
              for Inter-Domain Inter-Vendor PCE-initiated LSP Setup
               draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-inter-domain-lsp-00.txt

Abstract

   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains the information 
   of Label Switched Path (LSP) and resource availability within a 
   domain, so multiple stateful PCEs are able to provide traffic 
   engineering inter-domain routing through cooperating with each other.
   This document introduces the applicability of cooperative stateful 
   PCE for establishing inter-domain inter-vendor LSP which is initiated 
   by PCE.

Internet-Draft          Coopeartive Stateful PCE            October 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the setup of PCE-initiated inter-domain 
   inter-vendor LSPs under the cooperative stateful PCE model, which is 
   distributed controlled and deployed.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCE.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4655]: TED.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-
   stateful-pce-09]: Stateful PCE.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-
   initiated-lsp-02]: PCE-initiated LSP.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Source-PCE:  PCE that covers the source node of LSP request.

   Destination-PCE: PCE that covers the destination node of LSP request.

   Upstream-PCE:  The previous PCE that along the reversed direction of 
   domain sequence.

   Downstream-PCE:  The next PCE that along the positive direction of 
   domain sequence.

3.  Overview of the Stateful PCE

   [RFC4655] defines a stateful PCE to be one in which the PCE maintains 
   "strict synchronization between the PCE and not only the network 
   states (in term of topology and resource information), but also the 
   set of computed paths and reserved resources in use in the network."
   
   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-09] specifies a set of 
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and 
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657]. It includes 
   mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, 
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and 
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions and 
   focuses on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control 
   over them is delegated to the PCE.

4.  Multiple Stateful PCEs Deployment and Operation

   Multiple stateful PCEs can be deployed in a distributed architecture, 
   shown in Figure 1. Each domain contains a single stateful PCE, which 
   is responsible for maintaining intra-domain resource information and 
   controlling intra-domain LSP setup. All the PCEs are mesh-connected 
   and they may communicate with each other in a Virtual Local Area 
   Network (VLAN).

   The transport devices located in different domains may be supplied by 
   various vendors and probably own private configuration parameters, 
   such as IP address, port attribute, signaling protocol, etc. 
   Therefore, each domain is equipped with a dedicated Interface Adapter 
   (IA), which can convert different vendor-specific messages into 
   unified interface messages.

   Network Management System (NMS) is a centralized management entity, 
   which is aware of entire network resources and connected with all the 
   PCEs. NMS can initiate inter-domain LSP setup request that will be 
   sent to the source-PCE.

   The inter-domain path is computed by a set of distributed PCEs that 
   collaborate during path computation. The source PCE initiates inter-
   domain inter-vendor LSP setup, which is completed through cooperation 
   between multiple PCEs.

                   Figure 1  Cooperative PCEs Deployment

4.1.  Traffic Engineering Database

   Each PCE may collect local topology and TE information from transport 
   plane. Besides, in order to complete inter-domain path computation, 
   each PCE may collect all the inter-domain links and domains 
   information from a specific management entity, such as Network 
   Management System (NMS), which has the global visibility of network.

4.2.  Cooperative Inter-domain Path Computation

   When source-PCE receives an inter-domain path computation request 
   from NMS, the source-PCE will first determine an optimal domain 
   sequence and then cooperate with other PCEs to compute an optimal 
   inter-domain path based on the required constraints. The source-PCE 
   will generate the full set of strict hops from source node to 
   destination node.

Internet-Draft          Coopeartive Stateful PCE            October 2014


4.3.  Cooperative Inter-domain LSP Setup

   After inter-domain path computation, source-PCE splits the inter-
   domain path into multiple independent sub-paths according to domain 
   ID. Then, the source-PCE simultaneously sends all the sub-paths to 
   the relevant PCEs. Each PCE is responsible for its corresponding 
   intra-domain LSP setup.

   The source-PCE asynchronously receives the intra-domain LSP setup 
   response from all the relevant PCEs. If all the intra-domain LSPs are 
   successfully established and there are sufficient resources in the 
   relevant inter-domain links, the inter-domain inter-vendor LSP is 
   successfully established. Otherwise, the inter-domain inter-vendor 
   LSP fails to be established.

4.4.  Vendor-specific Message Conversion

   In order to eliminate the differences in vendor-specific message 
   formats of various vendors' domains, each domain is equipped with a 
   dedicated Interface Adapter (IA), which can convert different vendor-
   specific messages into unified interface messages.

5.  Applicability of Cooperative Stateful PCE

5.1.  TED initialization

   The Traffic Engineering Database (TED) of PCE includes intra-domain 
   information and inter-domain information, shown in Figure 2. 

   In the process of TED initialization, every PCE sends TED request to 
   the corresponding transport plane, which contains physical nodes and 
   physical links. Every PCE receives TED response from the transport 
   plane and stores the intra-domain resource information into its TED. 

   Meanwhile, every PCE sends TED request to Network Management System 
   (NMS), which is responsible for maintaining inter-domain links and 
   all the PCEs in the entire network. Every PCE receives TED response 
   from NMS and generates a global domain topology for subsequent inter-
   domain path computation. The domain topology stored in every PCE 
   should be the same.

5.2.1.  Inter-domain Inter-vendor LSP Setup Request

   The inter-domain inter-vendor LSP setup request is initiated through 
   NMS. The request contains source node information (IP address, 
   interface ID, timeslot), destination node information (IP address, 
   interface ID, timeslot), required bandwidth, granularity type, 
   protection type, and domain sequence. The request is sent to source-

              Figure 3  Inter-domain Path Computation Procedure

   In the inter-domain path computation procedure (shown in Figure 3), 
   source-PCE computes an optimal domain sequence according to global 
   domain topology. The domain sequence is an ordered list which 
   contains domain IDs from source-domain to destination-domain.

Internet-Draft          Coopeartive Stateful PCE            October 2014


   Source-PCE forwards the path computation request to downstream-PCE 
   according to the domain sequence. The downstream-PCE keeps on 
   forwarding the path computation request to its downstream-PCE until 
   the request is arrived at destination-PCE.

   Considering both the constraint requirements of request and local TED 
   information, destination-PCE computes many candidate paths from local 
   ingress border nodes to destination node. The path computation 
   response (including the candidate paths) are sent to upstream-PCE 
   according to the reversed domain sequence. The upstream-PCE generates 
   an integrated topology including local physical topology, inter-
   domain links and the candidate paths derived from the downstream-PCE. 
   The upstream-PCE computes many candidate paths from local ingress 
   border nodes to destination node in the new integrated topology. The 
   path computation response (including the candidate paths) are sent to 
   its upstream-PCE. The above process is recursive until the path 
   computation response is arrived at source-PCE. Finally, the source 
   PCE selects an optimal inter-domain path.

5.2.3.  Inter-domain Path Segmentation

   The source-PCE splits the inter-domain path into multiple independent 
   sub-paths according to domain ID. Different sub-path belongs to 
   different domain.

5.2.4.  Intra-domain LSP Setup Procedure

   In Figure 4, the source-PCE simultaneously sends all the sub-paths to 
   the relevant PCEs. Each PCE is responsible for its corresponding 
   intra-domain LSP setup. In the intra-domain LSP setup procedure, PCE 
   sends intra-domain LSP setup request to local Interface Adapter (IA). 
   IA converts the LSP setup request into vendor-specific message and 
   then sends the message to transport plane. IA receives LSP setup 
   response from transport plane and converts it into a unified message. 
   PCE receives intra-domain LSP setup response from IA and the intra-
   domain LSP setup procedure is finished.

         Figure 4  Inter-domain Inter-vendor LSP Setup Procedure

5.2.5.  Inter-domain Inter-vendor LSP Setup Response

   The source-PCE asynchronously receives the intra-domain LSP setup 
   response from all the relevant PCEs. If all the intra-domain LSPs are 
   successfully established and there are sufficient resources in the 
   relevant inter-domain links, the inter-domain inter-vendor LSP is 
   successfully established. Otherwise, the inter-domain inter-vendor 
   LSP fails to be established. 

5.3.  TED Synchronization 

   In order to avoid resource conflicts, the TED stored in every PCE 
   must be updated in time. Once an inter-domain inter-vendor LSP is 
   successfully established, the modification of network resources must 
   be announced to all the relevant PCEs. 

   TED synchronization process includes intra-domain TED synchronization 
   process and inter-domain TED synchronization process. PCEs that are

   involved to the inter-domain LSP should synchronize their intra-
   domain resources with underlying transport plane. And every PCE 
   should synchronize inter-domain links to ensure that its global 
   domain topology is identical to other PCEs.

   In the process of intra-domain TED synchronization, source-PCE sends 
   intra-domain links synchronization requests to the relevant PCEs. 
   Each relevant PCE synchronizes intra-domain links information with 
   underlying transport plane through message conversion by local 
   Interface Adapter (IA).

   In the process of inter-domain TED synchronization, source-PCE sends 
   inter-domain links synchronization requests to all the PCEs. Every 
   PCE should modifies the information of inter-domain links and updates 
   its global domain topology for subsequent inter-domain path 
   computation.

6.  Security Considerations

   PCEP security is defined [RFC5440]. Any multi-domain operation 
   necessarily involves the exchange of information across domain 
   boundaries. This does represent a significant security and 
   confidentiality risk. PCEP allows individual PCEs to maintain 
   confidentiality of their domain path information using path-keys 
   [RFC5520].

   For further considerations of the security issues related to inter-
   domain path computation, see [RFC5376].
