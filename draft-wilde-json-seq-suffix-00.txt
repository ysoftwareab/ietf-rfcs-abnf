     A Media Type Structured Syntax Suffix for JSON Text Sequences
                     draft-wilde-json-seq-suffix-00

Abstract

   Structured Syntax Suffixes for media types allow other media types to
   build on them and make it explicit that they are built on an existing
   media type as their foundation.  This specification defines and
   registers "json-seq" as a structured syntax suffix for JSON Text
   Sequences.

1.  Introduction

   Media Type Structured Syntax Suffixes [2] were introduced as a way of
   how a media type can signal that it is based on another media type as
   its foundation.  Some structured syntax suffixes were registered
   initially [5], including "+json" for the widely popular JSON Format
   [4] format.

   JSON Text Sequences [3] is a new specification in the JSON space that
   defines how a sequence of multiple JSON texts can be represented in
   one representation.  Since this specification can be used as the
   foundation for other formats, this specification defines and
   registers the "+json-seq" structured syntax suffix.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3.  Using +json-seq

   The use case for the "+json-seq" structured syntax suffix is the same
   as for "+json": It SHOULD be used by media types when parsing the
   JSON Text Sequence of a media type leads to a meaningful result, by
   simply using the generic JSON Text Sequence processing.

   Applications encountering such a media type then can either simply
   use generic processing if all they need is a generic view of the JSON
   Text Sequence, or they can use generic JSON Text Sequence tools for

   initial parsing, and then can implement their own specific processing
   on top of that generic parsing tool.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added the following "+json-seq" structured syntax suffix to
   its registry of structured syntax suffixes established by [2]:

      Name: JSON Text Sequence

      +suffix: +json-seq

      References: [3]

      Encoding considerations: See [3]

      Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics of
      fragment identifiers specified for +json-seq SHOULD be as
      specified for "application/json-seq".  (At publication of this
      document, there is no fragment identification syntax defined for
      "application/json-seq".)

         The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a
         specific "xxx/yyy+json-seq" SHOULD be processed as follows:

            For cases defined in +json-seq, where the fragment
            identifier resolves per the +json-seq rules, then process as
            specified in +json-seq.

            For cases defined in +json-seq, where the fragment
            identifier does not resolve per the +json-seq rules, then
            process as specified in "xxx/yyy+json-seq".

            For cases not defined in +json-seq, then process as
            specified in "xxx/yyy+json-seq".

      Interoperability considerations: n/a
