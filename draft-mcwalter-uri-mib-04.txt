Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent STD 66
   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).  The intent is that these
   textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB modules that
   would otherwise define their own representation(s).

Internet-Draft                 URI TC MIB                     March 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It defines textual conventions to represent STD 66 [RFC3986] URIs,
   which are further described by [RFC3305].

   Three textual conventions are defined, one of unrestricted length,
   and two of different restricted lengths.  Which length is appropriate
   will depend on tradeoffs made in particular MIB modules.  The purpose
   of providing standard restricted-length textual conventions is to
   improve compatibility between MIB modules that require restricted-
   length URIs.

   If a URI needs to be used as an index object, then the 'Uri' textual
   convention SHOULD be subtyped to a length appropriate for the OID of
   which it is part.  The description of the 'Uri' textual convention
   discusses this case.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

            sections 6.2.1, 6.2.2.1, and 6.2.2.2.  All unnecessary
            percent-encoding is removed, and all case-insensitive
            characters are set to lowercase except for hexadecimal
            digits, which are normalized to uppercase as described in
            section 6.2.2.1.

            The purpose of this normalization is to help provide unique
            URIs.  Note that this normalization is not sufficient to
            provide uniqueness.  Two URIs that are textually distinct
            after this normalization may still be equivalent.

            Objects using this textual convention MAY restrict the
            schemes that they permit.  For example, 'data:' and 'urn:'
            schemes might not be appropriate.

            A zero-length URI is not a valid URI.  This can be used to
            express 'URI absent' where required, for example when used
            as an index field.

            Where this textual convention is used for an index field,
            it MUST be subtyped to restrict its length.  There is an

5.  Security Considerations

   See also the Security Considerations of STD 66 [RFC3986].

   This MIB module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a textual convention that may be imported by other MIB
   modules and used for object definitions.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document therefore has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

6.  IANA Considerations

   URI-TC-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the URI-TC-MIB module specified
