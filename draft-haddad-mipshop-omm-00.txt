Abstract

   Micromobility protocols address mobile nodes (MN) movements within a
   particular IP network domain.  This document introduces a new
   protocol "Optimized Micromobility Management" (OMM), to manage
   Micromobility.  The suggested solution is based on the Hierarchical
   Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) proposal and aims to increase the mobility
   performance by reducing the handover latency and the packet loss.

Internet-Draft     Optimizing Micromobility Management        April 2005


1.  Introduction

   Managing Micromobility has been addressed in many different ways.
   Among existing proposals (e.g., [HMIPv6], [CIP], [HAWAII], etc), only
   the HMIPv6 proposal has been adopted by the IETF.

   This document introduces a new protocol, i.e., OMM, to manage
   Micromobility.  The suggested solution is entirely based on the
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) proposal and aims to increase the
   mobility performance by reducing the handover latency and packet
   loss.  For these purposes, the OMM protocol uses virtual mobility
   anchor points (VMAPs) and splits the handover event into two
   successive phases triggered by the network and the mobile node (MN).

   +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   |         Term        |                  Definition                 |
   +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   |   Mobility Anchor   | A Mobility Anchor Point is a router located |
   |     Point (MAP)     |   in a network visited by the mobile node.  |
   |                     | One or more MAPs can exist within a visited |
   |                     |                   domain.                   |
   |                     |                                             |
   |  Virtual MAP (VMAP) |   A virtual MAP is a router located inside  |
   |                     |  the IP network domain (i.e., a MAP is also |
   |                     |      a VMAP), which implements a set of     |
   |                     |   features, which includes a subset of the  |
   |                     |  MAP features. A VMAP node stores the MN's  |
   |                     | Regional Care-of Address (RCoA) and current |
   |                     |  Local Care-of Address (LCoA) for a limited |
   |                     |      period of time (e.g., the binding      |
   |                     |  lifetime), computes the new MN's LCoA and  |
   |                     |  encapsulates when needed data packets sent |
   |                     |  by the CN to the MN's current location. At |
   |                     |    any particular time during an ongoing    |
   |                     |  session(s), the mobile node should have AT |
   |                     |   MOST one VMAP encapsulating data packets  |
   |                     |    and fowarding them to its new current    |
   |                     |                  location.                  |
   |                     |                                             |
   |  Access Router (AR) |   The mobile node's default router. The AR  |
   |                     |  aggregates the outbound traffic of mobile  |
   |                     |     nodes. An AR can also be a MAP/VMAP.    |
   |                     |                                             |
   |   Regional Care-of  |  An RCoA is an IPv6 address obtained by the |
   |    Address (RCoA)   |   mobile node from the visited network. An  |
   |                     |  RCoA is an address on the MAP's subnet. It |
   |                     | is auto-configured by the MN when receiving |
   |                     |               the MAP option.               |
   |                     |                                             |
   |   On Link Care-of   | The LCoA is the on-link CoA configured on a |
   |    Address (LCoA)   | mobile node's interface based on the prefix |
   |                     |     is advertised by its default router.    |
   |                     |                                             |
   |  Tree Architecture  |       An IP network domain has a tree       |
   |                     | architecture when any router located inside |
   |                     |   the domain (i.e., except the ARs and the  |
   |                     |   root gateway(s)) has only one uplink and  |
   |                     |  one or more downlink(s). Such topology has |
   |                     |                no mesh links.               |
   |                     |                                             |

   |                     |    domain has one or more mesh link(s) in   |

4.  Overview of HMIPv6

   The two main goals behind designing the [HMIPv6] protocol are to
   reduce both the heavy amount of signaling messages generated by the
   MIPv6 protocol and the handover latency.  A third goal is to enable
   the MN to hide its movements and current location from the CN and the
   HA.

   HMIPv6 consists on deploying one or more special nodes called
   Mobility Anchor Point, i.e, MAP, within the IP network domain.  A MAP
   can be defined as a local home agent, which intercepts all packets
   addressed to registered mobile nodes and tunnels them to the MN.

   When a MN enters to an HMIPv6 domain, it starts by selecting, then
   registering itself with the appropriate MAP.  This is done by
   processing special information sent by the MN's AR in the Router
   Advertisement (RtAdv) message.  These information allow the MN to
   auto-configure a regional care-of address (RCoA), which will be used
   by the MAP to capture packets sent from outside the domain to the
   MN's care-of address (i.e., RCoA),  and a link care-of address
   (LCoA), which will be used by the MAP to locate the MN inside the MAP
   domain.

   It should be noted at this stage that HMIPv6 recommends that the MN
   selects the furthest MAP to avoid frequent MAP changes, which in turn
   implies going through the time consuming MAP registration procedure
   during the handover.

   Each time the MN moves to a new AR, it has to configure a new LCoA
   and registers it with the MAP.  This is done by sending a Local
   Binding Update (LBU) message to the MAP.  The LBU message allows the
   MAP to bind the new LCoA to the MN's RCoA.

5.  Problem, Motivation and Requirements

   HMIPv6 protocol succeeds in eliminating redundant signaling messages
   in MIPv6, i.e., the HoTI/HoT and CoTI/CoT messages, while keeping
   only critical mobility messages, i.e., local binding update (LBU) and
   binding acknowledgement (BA) messages, exchanged between the MN and
   the MAP.

   However, HMIPv6 partially succeeds in reducing the handover latency
   since the LBU message sent from the MN to the MAP will most likely
   have to travel on a relatively long path within the domain before
   reaching the MAP (being supposedly static), in order to trigger a re-
   routing of the data packets flow to the MN's new LCoA (nLCoA).  Such
   delay may result in packet loss, which becomes more alarming if the
   MN is moving at a high speed within the MAP domain while running time
   sensitive applications.

   This is mainly due to the fact that HMIPv6 recommends avoiding
   changing the MAP as much as possible.  Consequently, HMIPv6 suggests
   choosing the furthest MAP in the hierarchical domain, which is in
   most cases the domain gateway node(s).

   In addition, HMIPv6 practically converts any network topology (i.e.,
   mesh or random) to a tree topology, which if deployed alone, lacks
   both robustness and load balancing features.

   Based on that, HMIPv6 does not take any advantage from a mesh or
   random topology since all signaling messages are sent on the shortest
   uplink path to the root of the tree topology, i.e., the furthest MAP
   gateway.

   But it should be noted that HMIPv6 provides the lowest handover
   latency among other micromobility proposals (e.g., HAWAII and CIP)
   for the first handover only, i.e., when the MN enters into an HMIPv6
   domain.  But when the MN starts moving within the MAP domain then the
   handover performance start decreasing when compared to the two other
   proposals ([TOMOP], [MIPS]).

   Note that, although the mobility performance may increase in both CIP
   and HAWAII proposals, the CIP protocol continuously involves every
   node on the path between the gateway and the MN, and requires being
   implemented in the base station.  On the other hand, the HAWAII
   proposal relies on sub-optimal routing path(s), which in turn can
   lead to an unoptimized load balancing in the access network.

Internet-Draft     Optimizing Micromobility Management        April 2005


   Based on the above, the requirements for a new optimized micro-
   mobility protocol, which offer the main advantages of each of the
   above protocol, are:

   a.  The load of signaling messages required during the handoff
       procedure should be minimized as much as possible.

   b.  In order to minimize or eliminate the handoff latency and packet
       loss, the load of signaling messages should be concentrated only
       near the involved MN's new AR.

   c.  As it is the case in HMIPv6, the handoff procedure should result
       at the end in a new optimal path between the MAP and the new MN's
       location.

   d.  Any new node in the MAP domain which may be involved in the
       handoff procedure should be maintained in soft-state so that
       invalid bindings/keys are deleted automatically.

   e.  All signaling Messages exchanged between routers and between
       routers and the MAP are authenticated.

   The above requirements led to the design of a simple proposal, which
   is totally built on top of HMIPv6 and increases the performance of IP
   handovers, which occur within an HMIPv6 domain.  In addition, the OMM
   protocol takes full advantage from a mesh/random topology.

6.  Overview of the OMM Protocol

   The OMM protocol aims to bring key advantages provided by some
   existing micromobility proposals, like CIP, HAWAII and HMIPv6, while
   minimizing/eliminating their different drawbacks.  The OMM protocol
   fulfills requirements a), b) and c) by adding at most one message
   between the MN's nAR and one special node (i.e., VMAP) located
   nearby.  Moreover, the OMM protocol allows the MN to skip the DAD or,
   in the worst case, to perform it in parallel with exchanging data.

   In short, the OMM protocol splits the IP handover into two successive
   events.  The first one is a network handover (NH) and is triggered by
   the infrastructure itself (i.e., the MN's new AR).  Note that the NH
   greatly benefits from a random network topology, i.e., it relies on
   sub-optimal routing of data packets (as in HAWAII) sent to the MN, in
   exchange for a shorter latency and minimum packets loss.

   The main goals behind triggering first a network handover are to
   reduce the latency and packet loss as much as possible.  In other
   words, the NH aims to eliminate the latency variable from the second
   event, which is the handover triggered by the MN itself according to
   HMIPv6 protocol.

   For these purposes, the OMM protocol requires implementing a limited
   set of the MAP features on routers located between the MAP and the
   ARs, i.e., in order to convert them to VMAPs.  Each time the MAP gets
   an LBU message from the MN, it sends a BA message, which is used also
   to store the MN's RCoA in the VMAP(s) located near the MN and on the
   path between the MAP and the MN.  Note that these signaling data are
   stored in VMAP(s) in a soft state and must be removed immediatley
   after the expiration of the Binding Update Lifetime set by the MN in
   the LBU message.

   Each time, the network infrastructure triggers a NH, the VMAP
   simulates the MAP role for a limited period of time, i.e., until the
   second event is completed, thus significantly reducing the latency
   and packets loss.

   It becomes clear from the above that, in order to get the best
   performance from the NH, the selected VMAP must be located as close
   as possible to the MN's new AR (or within the nAR itself depending on
   the network topology).

   In the OMM protocol, the second event, i.e., handover triggered by
   the MN, aims only to re-direct data packets flow sent to the MN to a
   more optimal path.  Such step is needed, especially that the first
   event, i.e., NH, may use a sub-optimal path to pull data packets flow
   to the MN's new LCoA.  As described in HMIPv6, the second event

   updates the MAP BCE with the new MN's LCoA in order to allow the MAP
   to tunnel data packets to the new MN's LCoA.

   Finally, it should be noted that the worst case scenario in OMM
   protocol is the failure of the NH, which means having only the
   handover triggered by the MN itself, as defined in HMIPv6.  This lead
   us to the HMIPv6 case.

7.  OMM Protocol Description

   As mentioned earlier, OMM protocol consists on implementing a limited
   set of MAP features (and one new feature) in routers located between
   the MAP and the ARs.  A router with the added set of MAP features is
   called a virtual MAP (VMAP).  A VMAP enabled router MUST provide the
   two following features:

   o  Store the MN's IPv6 addresses (i.e., RCoA and LCoA) in its Virtual
      Binding Cache Entry (VBCE).  This is performed upon receiving a BA
      message carrying a binding hop-by-hop message.

   o  Check the ownership of the old MN's old LCoA (oLCoA), computes the
      new MN's LCoA (nLCoA) and tunnel data packets sent to the MN's
      nLCoA.  This is performed upon receiving a Routing Path Update
      (RPU) message.

   The techniques proposed in this document work at their best when the
   following conditions are met:

   o  The MAP domain has a random network topology.

   o  Messages exchanged between routers (i.e., VMAPs and ARs), located
      within the same MAP domain are authenticated.

   o  All routers located in the same MAP domain can be converted to
      VMAPs.  This assumption applies also for the ARs.  Note that this
      is not a required condition.  If there are no VMAPs on the path
      between the nAR and the pLCoA the situation boils down to the base
      HMIPv6 case.

   However, it should be noted that adding links between ARs and
   converting some or all of them to VMAPs can bring additional
   performance to the OMM protocol and help avoiding updating all
   exiting VMAPs located between the MAP and the MN each time the MN
   switches to a new AR.

   HMIPv6 protocol requires the ARs to add the MAP functions data to
   their RtAdv messages sent to the MN.  These information allow the MN
   to select the furthest MAP, auto-configure an RCoA and an LCoA and
   send them to the MAP in an LBU message.  The two addresses enable the
   MAP to create the binding and to intercept data packets sent to the
   MN's RCoA and tunnel them to the MN's current location.

   When the MN enters for the first time to an HMIPv6 domain, it MUST
   follow the HMIPv6 protocol.  The first new step introduced by the OMM
   protocol consists on alerting the MN of the support for the OMM
   protocol.  This is done by setting the Optimization (O) bit (defined

   in 8.10) in the RtAdv message sent by the AR.

   The second step starts when the MAP sends a BA message after
   receiving an LBU message from the MN.  The MAP MUST insert in the BA
   message a new hop-by-hop option called "Virtual Binding" (VB).  The
   VB must carry the MN's two IPv6 addresses sent to the MAP in the BU,
   the binding lifetime and the "Address Management Key" (Kam).  Note
   that the Kam SHOULD be derived from hashing the shared secret
   established between the MN and the MAP so that the MN does not need
   to store a new Key.

   Finally, the MAP MUST authenticate the VB option with the Kam and
   MUST encrypt the Kam field with a shared key pre-computed between the
   MAP and the VMAPs.

   Upon receiving a BA message carrying a VB hop-by-hop option, the VMAP
   starts by checking if its VBCE has an entry corresponding to the MN's
   LCoA.  If this is the case, the VMAP should update any existing value
   (e.g., binding lifetime) with the new one carried in the VB option.
   In case there is no entry, the VMAP MUST create one, which includes
   all data sent in the VB.

   The third step occurs when the MN switches to a new link.  In such
   scenario, the MN starts by sending a RtSol message, which MUST
   contain its RCoA, its pLCoA and a proof of ownership of the two
   addresses.

   The proof is carried in a new option (i.e., "Address Check" (AC)
   option defined in Section 8.1) and is presented as the result of the
   following:

   Proof = First[64, HMAC(Kam, (RCoA | pLCoA)]

   The MN's addresses and the proof of ownership are carried in two
   different options defined in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2

   The VMAP MUST delete from its VBCE all information related to one
   particular MN upon the expiration of the binding lifetime, unless
   another BA is sent by the MAP carrying a new binding lifetime (i.e.,
   the MN has sent a new LBU message carrying the same LCoA to the MAP).

   The next step in the OMM protocol consists on triggering a network
   handover (NH).  This is done by the MN's nAR upon receiving a RtSol
   message, which contains the two options.  In such scenario, the AR
   SHOULD send in parallel a Route Path Update (RPU) message to the MN's
   pLCoA (carried by the RtSol message) and a RtAdv message to the MN.
   Note that the RPU message MUST be signed by the nAR.

   When a VMAP receives an RPU message, it starts by checking its VBCE
   for an entry which contains the couple (RCoA, pLCoA).  If an entry is
   found, the VMAP fisrct hecks whether the proof contained in the
   message is valid.  If so, it computes the MN's nLCoA IID and updates
   its VBCE with the new MN's nLCoA.  The same IID MUST be computed by
   the MN and in the same following way:

   nLCoA(IID) = First[64, HMAC(Kam, (RCoA | pLCoA | New_Subnet_Prefix)]

   After updating its VBCE, the VMAP starts tunnelling data packets sent
   by the MAP to the MN's pLCoA to its new location (i.e., nLCoA).  The
   VMAP MUST delete the MN's correponding entry from its VBCE at the
   expiration of the routing binding lifetime (RBL) sent by the MN's nAR
   in the RPU message.  Note that the RBL value may be predefined.

   After the MN gets a new LCoA, it MUST send an LBU message to the MAP.
   The LBU message updates the MAP's BCE, re-route the data traffic by
   using a more optimized route between the MAP and the MN and update
   the VMAP (i.e., via the BA message) on the new path between the MN
   and the MAP.  It should be noted that many VMAPs may be updated by
   one specific BA message.  However, the decision to turn on/off more
   than one VMAP on a particular path should be taken based on the
   network topology around that path.

8.3  The VMAP (V) Bit

   The VMAP bit is a new bit used in the OMM proposal to request VMAP
   node(s) located between the MAP and the MN's current location to
   store the MN's addresses (i.e., RCoA and LCoA) and the binding
   lifetime in their VBCE(s).  The VMAP bit MUST be set by the MAP in
   the BA message each time the MAP receives a valid LBU message from
   the MN.  Note that the MN MUST ignore such bit.

9.  Security Considerations

   The OMM protocol assumes that all signaling messages exchanged
   between routers (e.g., VMAPs) located within a MAP domain are
   authenticated.

   The OMM protocol does not introduce nor amplify any new or existing
   attacks or threats.  However, it should be noted that triggering a
   network handover without providing a proof of ownership of the
   previous LCoA mentioned in the RtSol message sent by the MN to the
   nAR may allow to re-direct/steal data packets sent to another node
   attached to the MN's previous AR.
