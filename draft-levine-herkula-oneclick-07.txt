       Signalling one-click functionality for list email headers
                    draft-levine-herkula-oneclick-07

Abstract

   This document describes a method for signaling a one-click function
   for the list-unsubscribe email header field.  The need for this
   arises out of the actuality that mail software sometimes fetches URLs
   in mail header fields, and thereby accidentally triggers
   unsubscriptions in the case of the list-unsubscribe header field.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   An [RFC2369] email header field can contain HTTPS [RFC7230] URIs.  In
   a List-Unsubscribe header field the HTTPS URI is intended to
   unsubscribe the recipient of the email from the list.  But anti-spam
   software often fetches all resources in mail header fields
   automatically, without any action by the user, and there is no
   mechanical way for a sender to tell a request made automatically by
   anti-spam software from one manually requested by a user.  To prevent
   accidental unsubscriptions, senders return landing pages with a
   confirmation step to finish the unsubscribe request that a live user
   would recognize and act on, but an automated system would not.  This
   makes the unsubscription process more complex than a single click.

   Operators of broadcast marketing lists tend to be primarily concerned
   about deliverability of their mail: whether the mail is delivered to
   the recipients and how the messages are presented, e.g., whether in
   the primary inbox or in a junk folder.  Many mail systems allow
   recipients to report mail as spam or junk, and mail from senders with
   a lot of junk reports often has poor deliverability.  Hence the
   mailers want to make it as easy as possible for recipients to

   unsubscribe, since the recipient's alternative to a difficult
   unsubscription process is to report mail from the sender as junk
   until it goes away.

   Operators of recipient mail systems are aware that their users do not
   make a clear distinction between unsubscription and junk.  In some
   cases they allow trustworthy mailers to request notification when
   their mail is reported as junk, so they can unsubscribe the
   recipient, but the process of identifying trustworthy mailers and
   notifying them does not scale well to large numbers of small mailers.
   This specification provides a way for recipient systems to notify the
   mailer automatically, using only information within the mail message,
   and without prearrangement.  Some recipient systems might wish to
   send an unsubscription notice to mailers whenever a user reports a
   message as junk, or they might give the user the option to report and
   unsubscribe.

   If a mail recipient is unsubscribing manually and the unsubscription
   process requires confirmation, the resulting web page is presented to
   the recipient who can then click the appropriate button.  But when
   the unusubscribe action is combined with a MUA junk report, there is
   no direct user interaction with the mailer's web site.  Similarly, if
   a mail system automatically unsubscribes recipient mailboxes that
   have been closed or abandoned, there can be no interaction with a
   user who is not present.  In those cases, the unsubscription process
   has to work without manual intervention, and in particular without
   requiring that software attempt to interpret the contents of a
   confirmation page.

   This document addresses this part of the problem, with an HTTPS POST
   action for mail receivers.  Mail senders can distinguish this action
   from other unsubscribe requests and handle it as a one-click
   unsubscription without manual intervention by the mail recipient.

   This document has several goals.

   o  Allow email senders to signal that a [RFC2369] List-Unsubscribe
      header field has One-Click functionality.

   o  Allow MUA users to unsubscribe from mailing lists in a familiar
      environment and without leaving the MUA context.  A receiving
      system can process an unsubscription request in the background
      without further interaction, and know that it can be fully
      processed by the mail sender's system.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when written
   in all capital letters.

3.  Implementation

3.1.  Mail senders

   An mail sender that wishes to enable one-click unsubscribes places
   one List-Unsubscribe header field and one List-Unsubscribe-Post
   header field in the message.  The List-Unsubscribe header field MUST
   contain one HTTPS URI.  It MAY contain other non-HTTP/S URIs such as
   MAILTO:.  The List-Unsubscribe-Post header contains key/value pairs
   needed by the mail sender, separated by ampersands.  The list of key/
   value pairs MUST contain the pair "List-Unsubscribe=One-Click".
   There is no provision for continuing a List-Unsubscribe-Post header
   field, so the size of the of key/value pairs is limited by the
   maximum length of a line.

   The combination of the URI in the List-Unsubscribe header and the
   POST arguments in the List-Unsubscribe-Post header MUST contain
   enough information to identify the mail recipient and the list from
   which the recipient is to be removed, so that the unsubscription
   process can complete automatically.  In particular, One-click has no
   way to ask the user what address or from what list the user wishes to
   unsubscribe.

   The URI and POST arguments SHOULD include an opaque identifier or
   other hard to forge component in addition to or instead of the plain-
   text names of the list and the subscriber.  The server handling the
   unsubscription SHOULD verify that the hard to forge component is
   valid.  This will deter attacks in which a malicious party sends spam
   with List-Unsubscribe links for a victim list, with the intention of
   causing list unsubscriptions from a victim list as a side effect of
   users reporting the spam.

   The mail sender needs to provide the infrastructure to handle POST
   requests to the specified URI in the List-Unsubscribe header, and to
   handle the unsubscribe requests that its mail will provoke.

   The One-Click action triggered by this URI SHOULD complete promptly
   and not burden the requester in an inappropriate way.  The mail
   sender MUST NOT return an HTTPS redirect, since redirected POST
   actions have historically not worked reliably.

Internet-Draft            One click unsubscribe           September 2016


3.2.  Mail receivers

   A mail receiver that wants do a one-click unsubscription performs an
   HTTPS POST to the HTTPS URI in the List-Unsubscribe header and sends
   the content of the List-Unsubscribe-Post header as the request body.

   The POST content SHOULD be sent as "multipart/form-data" [RFC7578]
   and MAY be sent as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".  These
   encodings are the ones used by web browsers when sending forms.  The
   target of the POST action is the same as or similar to the one in the
   GET action for a manual unsubscription, so this is intended to allow
   the same server code to handle both.

   The mail receiver MUST NOT perform a POST on the the HTTPS URI
   without user consent.  When and how the user consent is obtained is
   not part of this specification.

4.  Additional Requirements

   The email needs at least one valid authentication identifier.  In
   this version of the specification the only supported identifier type
   is DKIM [RFC6376].  Hence senders MUST apply at least one valid DKIM
   signature to the message.

   The List-Unsubscribe and List-Unsubscribe-Post headers MUST be
   covered by the signature and included in the "h=" tag of a valid
   DKIM-Signature header field.

5.  Header Syntax

   The following ABNF imports fields, WSP, and CRLF from [RFC5322].  It
   imports ALPHA and DIGIT from [RFC5234].

   fields /= list-unsubscribe-post

   ldh = ALPHA 0*(ALPHA | DIGIT | "-")

   list-unsubscribe-post = "List-Unsubscribe-Post:" 0*1WSP postarg
       0*( "&" postarg) CRLF

   postarg = ALPHA 0*ldh "=" freetext

   freetext = 1*(%x20-%xfe)
      ; space, ampersand, percent, equal sign, and non-ASCII characters
      ; are percent encoded

   The percent encoding for freetext is as described in section 2 of
   [RFC7578].

8.  Security Considerations

   The List-Unsubscribe-Post and/or List-Unsubscribe header can contain
   a plaintext or encoded version of the recipient address, but that
   address is usually also in the To: header.  This specification allows
   anyone with access to a message to unsubscribe the recipient of the
   message, but that's typically the case with existing List-
   Unsubscribe, just with more steps.

   A creative mailer could send spam with content intended to provoke
   large numbers of unsubscriptions, with suitably crafted headers to
   send POST requests with arbitrary contents to servers that perhaps
   don't want them.  But it's been possible to provoke GET requests in a
   similar way for a long time (and much easier, due to spam filter

   auto-fetches) so the chances of significantly increased annoyance
   seem low.

   Since the mailer's server that receives the POST request cannot in
   general tell where the request coming from, the URI or POST arguments
   SHOULD contain an opaque identifier or other hard to forge component
   to identify the list and recipient address.  That can ensure that the
   request originated from List-Unsubscribe and List-Unsubscribe-Post
   headers in a message the mailer sent.
