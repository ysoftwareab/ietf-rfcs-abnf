i = 1..Num of Locs   valid for the sending ILNPv6 node.

i = 1..Num of Locs   relative to other valid Locator[i]
                               values. The Preference numbers here are
                               identical, both in syntax and semantics,
                               to the Preference values for L64 records
                               as specified by [ILNP-DNS].

i = 1..Num of Locs   particular Locator may be considered
                               valid.  Normally, this is identical
                               to the DNS lifetime of the
                               corresponding L64 record, if one
                               exists.
