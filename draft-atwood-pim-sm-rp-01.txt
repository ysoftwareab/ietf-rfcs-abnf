Abstract 
    
    
   The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol 
   uses a core-based tree to forward multicast datagrams to members of 
   a multicast group. Currently there is no method for relocating the 
   core or Rendezvous Point (RP) for a group. Administratively chosen 
   RP's lead to low performance as the sources and receivers in the 
   multicast group join and leave the group. 
    
    
   This draft presents a mechanism for dynamically relocating the RP to 
   a position that minimizes the tree cost and improves performance.

                       RP relocation in PIM-SM          November 2001 
1. Introduction 
    
    
   The current method of choosing the RP for a multicast group is by 
   administratively selecting a position in the network depending upon 
   the expected source and receiver locations. However, with the 
   variety of today's high bandwidth applications being used, it is 
   impossible for an administrator to "guess" where the sources and 
   receivers are most likely to be [1].  
    
    
   To improve network performance, reduce tree costs and reduce delay, 
   it is necessary for the RP to be dependent on the sources and 
   receivers in the multicast group at any point in time. With sources 
   and receivers joining and leaving groups an RP has to be dynamically 
   relocated to maintain network efficiency and reduce delays. This 
   draft is an alternate proposal to the one made by Lin, et. al. [2]. 
    
    
    
2. Motivation and Objectives 
    
    
   Sparse mode PIM (PIM-SM) [3,4] uses a center specific tree 
   construction. The distribution center of PIM-SM is called a 
   Rendezvous Point (RP). PIM tree construction revolves around the 
   selection of the RP. All senders for the group must register with 
   the RP. Receivers requesting to join the group set up the path from 
   themselves to the RP. Thus the location of the RP decides the 
   efficiency of the multicast tree. From the user's point of view, 
   efficiency would mean minimizing end-to-end delay. The network would 
   prefer to minimize the tree cost and be able to reduce congestion. 
   The shared tree routed at the RP does not optimize the delivery path 
   through the network. If the RP is located far from the participants, 
   a longer packet delay is experienced and excessive resources are 
   consumed. If an RP is selected for a set of participants that later 
   changes drastically, the RP location will severely affect the 
   quality of the tree for new participants. Therefore the RP should be 
   dynamically located depending upon the participants in the multicast 
   group.  
    
    
   Ideally, we would want the RP to be located in the vicinity of the 
   senders to the multicast group. But there is not enough information 
   to proceed with such a calculation. Another method [2] would be to 
   use the RP-set broadcast by the BSR in the bootstrap message. But 
   this RP-set is too small and unlikely to contain the address of the 
   best RP for the multicast group. An algorithm that considers all the 
   potential routers would be best suited for calculating the best RP. 
    
    
   In each domain there is an elected BSR (Bootstrap Router) [5], which 
   collects candidate RP information and broadcasts it hop-by-hop to 
   all the routers. Routers that can act as RP's periodically unicast

   Candidate-RP-advertisement messages (C-RP-Advs) which contain group 
   prefixes for which the candidacy is advertised to the BSR. The BSR 
   then includes a set of these Candidate-RPs (the RP-Set), along with 
   the corresponding group prefixes, in Bootstrap messages it 
   periodically originates. 
    
    
 
3. New RP Calculation 
    
    
   Assume RPold is the current RP of G; we propose an RP relocation 
   mechanism that relocates the RP to RPnew. It should clearly be noted 
   that this relocation is done only when there is a significant 
   improvement in tree cost. The relocation comes into effect after a 
   certain time period and when there are changes in the group 
   membership.  
    
    
   To determine the position of RPnew, RPold uses the topology 
   information available to it from the Interior Gateway Protocol (such 
   as OSPF (Open Short Path First), which has the required information 
   in the Link State Database). We begin by describing two functions 
   that will help in deciding if the RP should be moved to a new 
   location or not. [These functions have been taken from [6] with 
   slight modifications. The paper [6] contains other algorithms for 
   calculating the best RP and they may be used instead of the one 
   mentioned here.] 
    
     1. The function cost_calculate(root) uses the estimation function 
     [6] to calculate the cost of a tree at a given root: 
    
    
          Let S be the set of sources for the multicast group, u a 
          source in S, root the supplied root to the algorithm and 
          d(a,b) the distance from a to b. First, get a lower bound on 
          the cost of the tree at some node. In this case, the best 
          case tree is linear, that is, all group members lie on the 
          path from the root to the farthest member. When distances are 
          given as hop counts, we can get a slightly tighter bound. 
          Specifically if two group members are at an equal distance, 
          the distribution tree cannot be completely linear, but must 
          have one additional link. Thus, 
    
    
            Est. Cost(min) = max d(root,u) + number of duplicate 
                                                 distance nodes in S  
    
    
          To get an upper bound on the cost of the tree routed at some 
          node, in the worst case tree no links are shared among the 
          paths to each member. Thus the maximum tree cost is the sum 
          of the member distances. If the number of group members 
          (other than the root, if it a member) is greater than the

                       RP relocation in PIM-SM          November 2001 
          root degree, we may tighten the bound by subtracting the 
          difference to account for the knowledge of sharing those 
          links. Thus, 
    
    
            Est. Cost(max) = sum d(root,u)          if |S|<=deg(root) 
                             sum d(root,u)-(|S|-deg(root))  otherwise 
    
    
          The final estimated cost is given by, 
      
      
            Est. Cost = (Est. Cost(min) + Est. Cost(max))/2 
    
    
    
     2. The function why_move() follows the following algorithm: 
      
          1. Assign a variable RPmove with the value RPold. 
           
          2. Call cost_calculate with RPmove as the root. Store the 
          cost in a variable currcost and the visited node in a list 
          dontrepeat[]. 
    
          3. Call cost_calculate with all of the neighboring unvisited 
          nodes of RPmove as the root. Store the lowest cost in a 
          variable lowestcost, the lowest cost node in a variable RPlow 
          and add the visited nodes to the list dontrepeat[]. 
           
          4. If lowestcost is lower than currcost then assign 
          lowestcost to currcost else goto step 6. 
           
          5. Assign RPmove with the value RPlow and goto step 3. 
           
          6. If RPmove is different from RPold and the estimated cost 
          of the tree with RP at RPold is greater than lowercost by 
          more than the threshold then return RPmove else return NULL. 
           
           
     The value of the variable threshold used in the algorithm is a 
     predefined value set by the network administrator. Thus calling 
     the function why_move() returns NULL if the RP should not be 
     relocated or returns RPmove if the RP should be relocated. This 
     leaves us with the problem of dynamically switching from RPold to 
     RPnew.

   relocation timer has expired and there is a change in the group

   Figure 1: Relocation 
    
    
   If RPnew is not NULL then the RP has to be relocated. For this a 
   MOVE_JOIN message is sent to RPnew and Move_RP message is sent to 
   the BSR. 
    
    
   RPnew can ignore all the messages if it is not an RP-capable router 
   or is configured not to act as RP for any group. If RPnew is RP-
   capable then it does the following: 
    
   On receiving the MOVE_JOIN message RPnew assumes the role of RP for 
   group G. When it receives an encapsulated message from RPold it 
   sends the message out on the multicast tree. When it receives a 
   message from a source it sends the message out on the multicast tree 
   and encapsulates and sends this to RPold. On receiving the Move_RP 
   message if the BSR does not find RPnew in the local pool of 
   candidate RPs it assumes that RPnew is not RP-capable and ignores 
   the message otherwise it does the following: 
    
     1. To exclude the current members of the RP-set from being the RP 
        for the group, the BSR can do one of the following: 
         
          i)   It changes the priority of RPnew for that group to the 
               minimum value of priority in that group (i.e. maximum 
               priority) and increases the priorities of all other 
               candidates for that group by 1; or

          ii)  It can only include the address of RPnew in the RP-set 
               being broadcast in the bootstrap message and leave out 
               all the remaining candidates. 
    
    
     2. The BSR then sends out its bootstrap message. 
    
    
   The routers on receiving this bootstrap message join the group at 
   RPnew. While this transition is taking place RPold continues to act 
   as the RP for the group. The MOVE_JOIN message sent to RPnew ensures 
   that RPold receives packets from RPnew during the transition. When 
   RPold receives a message from a source it continues to send to the 
   group and also encapsulates and sends the packet to RPnew. On 
   receiving a bootstrap message RPold checks the reloc_var. If the 
   reloc_var for the group is greater than 0 and the RP-set for the 
   group is unchanged, then it increases the value of reloc_var by 1.  
    
    
   Once all the members have pruned off from RPold, the tree to RPold 
   is torn down. RPold then sends a MOVE_OVER message to RPnew and 
   resets the reloc_var to zero. The state is then killed and the tree 
   is now set up at RPnew. On receiving the MOVE_OVER message RPnew 
   stops sending encapsulated messages to RPold. This method of RP 
   relocation ensures no loss of messages during the transition. 
    
   If RPold gets three bootstrap messages from the BSR with the same 
   RP-set then the value of reloc_var will be four. If the value of 
   reloc_var reaches four then RPold assumes that RPnew is not RP-
   capable and it sets the reloc_var to zero and continues to serve as 
   RP for the multicast group. RPold will also stop sending 
   encapsulated packets to RPnew.

6. Summary 
    
    
   This draft proposes a dynamic mechanism for relocating RP in the 
   PIM-SM multicast routing protocol. The original RP may not be the 
   ideal RP for the group and this method of relocating to an 
   appropriate position will help reduce delay and improve network 
   performance.
