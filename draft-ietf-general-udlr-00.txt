            supporting unidirectional paths in the Internet



1. Introduction

   Many distributed applications may benefit from a high bandwidth
   connection to the Internet. However, this requires high bandwidth
   links between remotes sites.

   A low-cost solution to deliver high bandwidth services over wide
   geographical areas via the use of broadcast satellite networks has
   been proposed by [ASBD].

   However, this solution is based on low cost receivers with zero
   bandwidth return. Connection over the satellite link is therefore
   unidirectional. The integration of these satellite networks with the
   Internet requires changes in common routing protocols.


2. A new architecture

   The advantage of a satellite network is to provide high bandwidth
   services independent of the user's location over a large geographical
   area.

   A satellite network comprises two types of stations: feeds, which can
   both send and receive packets, and receivers, which can only receive
   packets.

   Every receiver is composed of a satellite dish oriented toward a
   geostationary satellite, connected via an interface either to a user
   station (in this case the access method is referred to as basic
   access) or to a router (in this case the access method is referred to
   as subnetwork access). The user station has another interface, and
   the router has one or more extra interfaces, connected to the
   Internet.  Note that the cost of the hardware is made up of the cost
   of the satellite dish and of the reception card.

   Information is sent from feeds to satellites and then broadcast to
   all the receivers that belong to the satellite coverage.

   Installing feeds in strategic positions over the Internet will create
   shorter paths and packets will be routed via the satellite network
   that offers a higher bandwidth.


2.1 Basic access

   Basic access corresponds to the case when each receiver has a
   satellite dish.  The user's station is also connected to the Internet
   via a telephone/modem (e.g. PPP connection). This station has
   therefore two IP addresses, one belonging to the satellite subnet
   (SAT.x) and the other to the regular connection subnet (INT.y). See
   Figure 1.

                         Figure 1:  Basic access


   All requests to a remote server are sent via the phone line and
   responses from the server should be routed by a feed on the satellite
   network.


2.2 Subnetwork access

   Subnetwork access corresponds to the case when a subnet router has a
   satellite dish. See Figure 2. This router is then interconnected to
   the Internet via regular connections and to a subnetwork (such as R2
   in Figure 2).

                             ___   ___
                             \__\OO\__\  Satellite

         Server      \/                       ||

           ----    |         connections   |
                   -------------------------


                       Figure 2: Subnetwork access



   In that configuration only one satellite dish is required in order to
   serve a whole subnetwork. The management is also located in only one
   place, namely in the router.


3. Solutions

   For the basic access and the subnetwork access we propose solutions
   in order to handle unidirectional links.


3.1 A dynamic routing

   Satellite networks are able to cover nationwide areas and therefore
   address very important sets of receivers.

   That 'expandable topology' due to the potential increasing number of
   receivers (simple host or routers) leads us to consider dynamic
   routing solutions.

   Some modifications should be applied to protocols in order to handle
   unidirectional links. For example, the protocol ARP [rfc826] assumes
   that links are bidirectional, and it expects a communication between
   directly connected host. In the same way, routing protocols assume
   that communication between neighbor routers is bidirectional to
   exchange routing information. The configuration in Figure 2 is
   therefore not supported.


3.2 Basic Access

   The ARP protocol can not work properly, an ARP request sent by a feed
   to a host that belongs to the satellite network can not expect a
   response from receivers.

   Routing for that type of user's station is different from classical
   routing. Indeed, the station has two IP addresses : SAT.x (belongs to
   the satellite network) and INT.y (e.g. PPP connection to an Internet
   service provider), as depicted in Figure 1.

   Users send packets via the interface INT.y, incoming packets should
   be routed to the default address SAT.x.


3.3 Subnetwork access

   We consider here feeds and receivers as IP routers (R1 and R2 in
   Figure 3). The general problem is : how can a receiver announce
   routes to feeds since it can not communicate directly with them ?

   Our work is mainly based on the study of the most common routing
   protocols that will be used by feeds and receivers such as RIP
   [rfc1723] and OSPF [rfc1583] and DVMRP [rfc1075] for multicast
   routing.

   Unlike receivers, feeds can broadcast routing messages via the
   satellite network. A feed will expect to receive messages (e.g. a
   response to a request on a specific interface) from all its
   interfaces. Since a feed can not receive messages from the satellite
   network, routing protocols will consider that there is no reachable
   networks beyond it.

   In order to announce routes to feeds by receivers routing messages
   must be sent to the unicast address of each feed. This assumes that
   receivers can communicate with feeds via regular connections (See
   Figure 3).

                             ___   ___
                             \__\OO\__\  Satellite
   R1: Feed                   ^^    vv    Network
   R2: Receiver              ~/       \
                             /         \
                    uplink  /           \
                           /             \
                          /               \
                    ---- /                 V ----
          ---======>|R1|                     |R2|<=======---
                    ----                     ----
                     /\                       /\
                     ||   -----------------   ||
                      ====| regular       |====
                          |   connections |
                          -----------------

                              Figure 3


   Moreover, both the feed's and receiver's interfaces connected to the
   Internet (regular connection) hardly ever belong to the same
   subnetwork (due to long distances between feeds and receivers).
   Routing protocol daemons check, in order to ensure security, that the
   sender's address of a message belongs to the same subnetwork as the
   interface which received it. Therefore routing information will not
   be taken into account since the packet will be rejected.

   We have just described some problems that occur when trying to handle
   unidirectional links by common routing protocols. Specific problems
   related to RIP [1], OSPF [2] and DVMRP [3] are described in other
   documents. They are available at ftp://zenon.inria.fr/rodeo/udlr/


   4. Conclusion

   Improving user connectivity to the Internet at low cost seems
   possible, e.g. both for basic access or subntework access.

   However handling unidirectional links by standard routing protocols
   (RIP, OSPF, DVMRP) is not trivial and currently not supported. It
   requires changes in the current protocol specifications. Fortunately
   these changes should not lead to new versions of routing protocols
   (RIP and DVMRP) and should be transparent for routers not connected
   to satellite networks.
