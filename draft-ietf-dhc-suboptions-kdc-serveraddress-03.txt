Abstract

   This document defines a new sub-option for the CableLabs Client
   Configuration (CCC) DHCP option code for conveying the network 
   addresses of Key Distribution Center (KDC) servers.

1.  Introduction

   A CCC DHCP Option code providing the KDC server address will be
   needed for CableHome-compliant residential gateways configured to 
   use Kerberos for authentication as the first step in establishing
   a secure SNMPv3 link between the PS and the SNMP entity in the
   cable operator's data network.
   
   The CCC DHCP option code will be used to address specific needs of 
   CableLabs client devices during their configuration processes. This 
   document proposes a sub-option for the CCC DHCP option. 
   
   
   
   Luehrs, Woundy, & Bevilacqua        Expires August 2003         [Page 1]   Internet Draft	  KDC Server Address Sub-option       February 2003
   
   
   Configuration of a class of CableLabs client devices described in 
   [2] will require a DHCP sub-option to provide the client with the 
   network address of a KDC server in the cable operator's data 
   network. The class of devices assumed in [2] is unlike the class
   of devices considered in [1], which perform a DNS lookup of the 
   Kerberos Realm name to find the KDC server network address. 
   
   This document proposes a sub-option of the CCC DHCP option
   code for use with CableLabs client devices. The proposed sub-option
   encodes an identifier for the network address of each of one or more
   Key Distribution Center servers with which the CableLabs client 
   device exchanges security information. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


2.  Key Distribution Center IP Address Sub-option

   CableHome specifications will specify the Key Distribution 
   Center network address encoding as a sub-option of the CCC DHCP 
   Option code. This field will be used to inform the client device of 
   the network address of one or more Key Distribution Center servers. 

   The encoding of the KDC Server Address sub-option will adhere to the 
   format of an IPv4 address. The minimum length for this option is 4 
   octets, and the length MUST always be a multiple of 4. If multiple 
   KDC Servers are listed, they MUST be listed in decreasing order of 
   priority. The format of the KDC Server Address sub-option of the CCC 
   option code is as shown below:

    SubOpt  Len      Address 1               Address 2
   +------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   |  TBD |  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...
   +------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


3.  Security Considerations

   This document relies upon the DHCP protocol [4] for authentication
   and security, i.e., it does not provide security in excess of what
   DHCP is (or will be) providing. It does not expose any security
   threats beyond what is currently exposed by other DHCP options.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The KDC Server Address sub-option described in this document is 
   intended to be a sub-option of the CableLabs Client Configuration
   (CCC) option described in [1]. IANA is requested to assign and 
   register a sub-option code of the CCC option to the KDC Server 
   Address sub-option.
