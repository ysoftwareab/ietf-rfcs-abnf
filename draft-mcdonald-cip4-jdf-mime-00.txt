Abstract 

   The International Cooperation for the Integration of Processes in
   Prepress, Press, and Postpress (CIP4) is an international worldwide
   standards body located in Switzerland.  The purpose of CIP4 is to
   encourage computer based integration of all processes that have to be
   considered in the graphic arts industry.  CIP4 has defined two
   document formats that are encoded in W3C Extensible Markup Language
   (XML):  
   (1) CIP4 Job Definition Format (JDF) - an open standard for
       integration of all computer aided business and production
       processes around print media; 
   (2) CIP4 Job Messaging Format (JMF) - an open standard for job
       messaging using Hyper Text Transport Protocol/1.1 (HTTP/1.1,
       RFC2616) that defines Query, Command, Response, Acknowledge, and
       Signal message families.  
   
   This document defines two new MIME sub-types for IANA registration:  
   (1) 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml' for CIP4 Job Definition Format; 
   (2) 'application/vnd.cip4-jmf+xml' for CIP4 Job Messaging Format.

1.  Introduction

   [[RFC Editor:  Please replace the string 'RFC xxxx' with the assigned
   RFC number when this document is published as an Informational RFC]] 
   
   [CIP4-ORG] has defined the Job Definition Format (JDF) Specification 
   [CIP4-JDF], an open standard for integration of all computer aided
   business and production processes around print media.  
   
   This document defines two new MIME sub-types for IANA registration:  
   (1) 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml' for Job Definition Format
       [CIP4-JDF]; 
   (2) 'application/vnd.cip4-jmf+xml' for Job Messaging Format
       [CIP4-JMF].  
   
   This document follows the procedures for registration of new MIME
   types described in [RFC2048].  See the IANA registry at [IANA-MIME].
   
   Please send comments directly to the authors (see section 11).  



2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

3.  Registration of JDF MIME Sub-type

   To:  ietf-types@iana.org
   
   Subject:  Registration of MIME type 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml'
   
   MIME media type name:  application
   
   MIME subtype name:  vnd.cip4-jdf+xml (Vendor Tree)
   
   Required parameters:  none
   
   Optional parameters:  charset
   
     This parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter
     of the 'application/xml' media type as specified in [RFC3023].
     Although listed as an optional parameter, the use of the charset
     parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this information can be
     used by XML processors to determine authoritatively the character
     encoding of the XML MIME entity.  The charset parameter can also
     be used to provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-
     based content negotiation in HTTP.  "utf-8" [RFC2279] is the
     RECOMMENDED value, representing the UTF-8 charset.  UTF-8 is
     supported by all conforming processors of W3C XML/1.0.
   
   Encoding considerations:
   
     Each 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml' entity is a well-formed and
     valid XML document encoded in UTF-8 [RFC2279] or UTF-16 [RFC2781].
     See XML Media Types [RFC3023] for further encoding information.
     Per the JDF Specification (see URL below), each JDF document SNOULD
     contain a JDF 'Version' element.  So 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml'
     may be correctly used to label any future version of JDF content.
   
   Security considerations:
   
     See section 7 'Security Considerations' of this document.
   
   Interoperability considerations:
   
     See section 1.4.2 'Conformance Requirements for JDF Entities' in
     the JDF Specification (see URL below).
   
     For maximum interoperability, the use of validating XML processors
     is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  Although non-validating XML processors
     may be more efficient, they are not required to handle all features
     of XML.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new MIME sub-types for IANA registration
   after public review:  
   (1) 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml' for Job Definition Format
       [CIP4-JDF]; 
   (2) 'application/vnd.cip4-jmf+xml' for Job Messaging Format
       [CIP4-JMF].  



6.  Internationalization Considerations

   CIP4 JDF and JMF files [CIP4-JDF] are XML documents [W3C-XML] that
   are encoded in human-readable text, usually in the UTF-8 charset
   [RFC2279].  All CIP4 JDF and JMF files SHOULD contain an internal
   'charset' label in the XML declaration (first line of text), naming a
   'charset' from the IANA registry [IANA-CHAR].  
   
   Therefore, CIP4 JDF and JMF files conform to the "IETF Policy on
   Character Sets and Languages" [RFC2277].  



7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml' and
   'application/vnd.cip4-jmf+xml' are the same considerations as those
   specified for 'application/xml' in [RFC3023].  
   
   In addition, because of the extensibility features of JDF provided
   for in the JDF Specification [CIP4-JDF], it may also be possible that
   'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml' or 'application/vnd.cip4-jmf+xml' may
   describe content that has security implications beyond those
   described here.
