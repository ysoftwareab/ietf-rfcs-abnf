Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions     January 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] is a widely-deployed technology
   for the management of media sessions (such as voice calls) over the
   Internet.  SIP itself provides a signalling channel (typically via
   the User Datagram Protocol [UDP]), over which two or more parties can
   exchange messages for the purpose of negotiating a media session that
   uses a dedicated media channel such as the Real-time Transport
   Protocol [RTP].

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol [XMPP] also provides a
   signalling channel, typically via the Transmission Control Protocol
   [TCP].  Given the significant differences between XMPP and SIP, it is
   difficult to combine the two technologies in a single user agent.
   Therefore, developers wishing to add media session capabilities to
   XMPP clients have defined an XMPP-specific negotiation protocol
   called Jingle [JINGLE].

   However, Jingle has been designed to easily map to SIP for
   communication through gateways or other transformation mechanisms.
   Therefore, consistent with existing specifications for mapping
   between SIP and XMPP (see [SIP-XMPP] and other specifications in that
   "series"), this document describes a bi-directional protocol mapping
   for use by gateways that enable the exchange of media signalling
   messages between systems that implement SIP and those that implement
   the XMPP Jingle extensions.

   Note: The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [TERMS].


2.  Jingle to SIP

2.1.  Overview

   As mentioned, Jingle was designed in part to enable straightforward
   protocol mapping between XMPP and SIP.  However, given the
   significantly different technology assumptions underlying XMPP and
   SIP, Jingle is naturally different from SIP in several important
   respects:

   o  Base SIP messages and headers use a plaintext format similar in
      some ways to the Hypertext Transport Protocol [HTTP], whereas
      Jingle messages are pure XML.  Mappings between SIP headers and
      Jingle message syntax are provided below.

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions     January 2008


   o  The SIP payloads defining session semantics use the Session
      Description Protocol [SDP], whereas the equivalent Jingle payloads
      are defined as XML child elements of the Jingle <content/>
      element.  However, the Jingle specifications defining such child
      elements specify mappings to SDP for all Jingle syntax, making the
      mapping relatively straightforward.
   o  The SIP signalling channel is transported over UDP, whereas the
      signalling channel for Jingle is XMPP over TCP.  Mapping between
      the transport layers typically happens within a gateway using
      techniques below the application level, and therefore is not
      addressed in this specification.

2.2.  Syntax Mappings

2.2.1.  Generic Jingle Syntax

   Jingle is designed in a modular fashion, so that session description
   data is generally carried in a payload within the generic Jingle
   elements, i.e., the <jingle/> element and its <content/> child.  The
   following example illustrates this structure, where the XMPP stanza
   is a request to initiate an audio session using RTP over a raw UDP
   transport.

       </content>
     </jingle>
   </iq>

   In the foregoing example, the syntax and semantics of the <jingle/>
   and <content/> elements are defined in [JINGLE], the syntax and
   semantics of the <description/> element are defined in
   [JINGLE-AUDIO], and the syntax and semantics of the <transport/>
   element are defined in [JINGLE-UDP].  Other <description/> elements
   are defined in specifications for the appropriate application types
   (see for example [JINGLE-VIDEO]) and other <transport/> elements are
   defined in the specifications for appropriate transport methods (see
   for example [JINGLE-ICE], which defines an XMPP profile of [ICE]).

   At the core Jingle layer, the following mappings are defined.

2.2.2.  Audio Application Format

   A Jingle application format for audio exchange via RTP is specified
   in [JINGLE-AUDIO].  This application format effectively maps to the
   "RTP/AVP" profile specified in [RTP-AVP], where the media type is
   "audio" and the specific mappings to SDP syntax are provided in
   [JINGLE-AUDIO].

2.2.3.  Video Application Format

   A Jingle application format for video exchange via RTP is specified
   in [JINGLE-VIDEO].  This application format effectively maps to the
   "RTP/AVP" profile specified in [RTP-AVP], where the media type is
   "audio" and the specific mappings to SDP syntax are provided in
   [JINGLE-VIDEO].

2.2.4.  Raw UDP Transport Method

   A basic Jingle transport method for exchanging media over UDP is
   specified in [JINGLE-UDP].  This transport method involves the
   negotiation of an IP address and port only, and does not provide NAT
   traversal.  The Jingle 'ip' attribute maps to the connection-address
   parameter of the SDP c= line and the 'port' attribute maps to the
   port parameter of the SDP m= line.

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions     January 2008


2.2.5.  ICE-UDP Transport Method

   A more advanced Jingle transport method for exchanging media over UDP
   is specified in [JINGLE-ICE].  Under ideal conditions this transport
   method provides NAT traversal by following the Interactive
   Connectivity Exchange methodology specified in [ICE].  The relevant
   SDP mappings are provided in [JINGLE-ICE].

2.3.  Sample Scenarios

   The following sections provide sample scenarios (or "call flows")
   that illustrate the principles of interworking from Jingle to SIP.
   These scenarios are not exhaustive.

2.3.1.  Basic Voice Chat

   The protocol flow for a basic voice chat for which an XMPP user
   (juliet@example.com) is the iniator and a SIP user
   (romeo@example.net) is the responder.  The voice chat is consummated
   through a gateway.  To simplify the example, the transport method
   negotiated is "raw user datagram protocol" as specified in
   [JINGLE-UDP].

       </content>
     </jingle>
   </iq>

   If the payload types and transport candidate can be successfully used
   by both parties, then the initiator acknowledges the session-accept
   action.

   <iq from='romeo@example.net/v3rsch1kk3l1jk'
       id='accept1'
       to='juliet@example.com/t3hr0zny'
       type='result'/>

   The parties now begin to exchange media.  In this case they would
   exchange audio using the Speex codec at a clockrate of 8000 since
   that is the highest-priority codec for the responder (as determined
   by the XML order of the <payloadtype/> children).

   The parties may continue the session as long as desired.

   Eventually, one of the parties (in this case the responder)
   terminates the session.

   The gateway transforms the SIP BYE into XMPP syntax.

   <iq from='romeo@example.net/v3rsch1kk3l1jk'
       id='term1'
       to='juliet@example.com/t3hr0zny'

             reasoncode='no-error'
             sid='a73sjjvkla37jfea'/>
   </iq>

   The initiator returns an IQ-result acknowledging receipt of the
   session termination, which is used only by the gateway and not
   transformed into SIP syntax.

3.  SIP to Jingle

   To follow.


4.  Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for session management are given for
   SIP in [SIP] and for XMPP in [JINGLE] (see also [XMPP]).
