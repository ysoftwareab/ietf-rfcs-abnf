                     RTP Payload Format Constraints
                     draft-pthatcher-mmusic-rid-00

Abstract

   In this specification, we define a framework for identifying Source
   RTP Streams with the constraints on its payload format in the Session
   Description Protocol.  This framework uses "rid" SDP attribute to: a)
   effectively identify the Source RTP Streams within a RTP Session, b)
   constrain their payload format parameters in a codec-agnostic way
   beyond what is provided with the regular Payload Types and c) enable
   unambiguous mapping between the Source RTP Streams to their media
   format specification in the SDP.

   Note-1: The name 'rid' is not yet finalized.  Please refer to
   Section "Open Issues" for more details on the naming.

1.  Introduction

   Payload Type (PT) in RTP provides mapping between the format of the
   RTP payload and the media format description specified in the
   signaling.  For applications that use SDP for signaling, the
   constructs rtpmap and/or fmtp describe the characteristics of the
   media that is carried in the RTP payload, mapped to a given PT.

   Recent advances in standards such as RTCWEB and NETVC have given rise
   to rich multimedia applications requiring support for multiple RTP
   Streams with in a RTP session
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation],
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast] or having to support multiple codecs,
   for example.  These demands have unearthed challenges inherent with:

   o  The restricted RTP PT space in specifying the various payload
      configurations,

   o  The codec-specific constructs for the payload formats in SDP,

   o  Missing or underspecied payload format parameters,

   o  Ambiguity in mapping between the individual Source RTP Streams and
      their equivalent format specification in the SDP.

   This specification defines a new SDP framework for configuring and
   identifying Source RTP Streams (Section 2.1.10
   [I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy]) called "RTP Source Stream
   Identifier (rid)" along with the SDP attributes to constrain their
   payload formats in a codec-agnostic way.  The "rid" framework can be
   thought of as complementary extension to the way the media format
   parameters are specified in SDP today, via the "a=fmtp" attribute.
   This specification also proposes a new RTP header extension to carry
   the "rid" value, to provide correlation between the RTP Packets and
   their format specification in the SDP.

   Note that the "rid" parameters only serve to further constrain the
   parameters that are established on a PT format.  They do not relax
   any existing constraints.

2.  Key Words for Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

3.  Terminology

   The terms Source RTP Stream, Endpoint, RTP Session, and RTP Stream
   are used as defined in [I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy].

   [RFC4566] and [RFC3264] terminology is also used where appropriate.

4.  Motivation

   This section summarizes several motivations for proposing the "rid"
   framework.

   1.  RTP PT Space Exhaustion: [RFC3550] defines payload type (PT) that
       identifies the format of the RTP payload and determine its
       interpretation by the application.  [RFC3550] assigns 7 bits for
       the PT in the RTP header.  However, the assignment of static
       mapping of payload codes to payload formats and multiplexing of
       RTP with other protocols (such as RTCP) could result in limited
       number of payload type numbers available for the application
       usage.  In scenarios where the number of possible RTP payload
       configurations exceed the available PT space within a RTP
       Session, there is need a way to represent the additional payload
       configurations and also to effectively map a Source RTP Stream to
       its configuration in the signaling.

   2.  Codec-Specific Media Format Specification in SDP: RTP Payload
       configuration is typically specified using rtpmap and fmtp SDP
       attributes.  The rtpmap attribute provides the media format to
       RTP PT mapping and the ftmp attribute describes the media format
       specific parameters.  The syntax for the fmtp attribute is
       tightly coupled to a specific media format (such as H.264, H.265,
       VP8).  This has resulted in a myriad ways for defining the
       attributes that are common across different media formats.
       Additionally, with the advent of new standards efforts such as
       NETVC, one can expect more media formats to be standardized in
       the future.  Thus, there is a need to define common media
       characteristics in a codec-agnostic way in order to reduce the
       duplicated efforts and to simplify the syntactic representation
       across the different codec standards.

   3.  Multi-source and Multi-stream Use Cases: Recently, there is a
       rising trend with real-time multimedia applications supporting

Internet-Draft                     rid                      October 2015


       multiple sources per endpoint with various temporal resolutions
       (Scalable Video Codec) and spatial resolutions (Simulcast) per
       source.  These applications are being challenged by the limited
       RTP PT space and/or by the underspecified SDP constructs for
       exercising granular control on configuring the individual Source
       RTP Streams.

5.  SDP 'rid' Media Level Attribute

   This section defines new SDP media-level attribute [RFC4566],
   "a=rid".

a=rid:<rid-identifier> <direction> pt=<fmt-list> <rid-attribute>:<value> ...


   A given "a=rid" SDP media attribute specifies constraints defining an
   unique RTP payload configuration identified via the "rid-identifier".
   A set of codec-agnostic "rid-level" attributes are defined
   (Section 6) that describe the media format specification applicable
   to one or more Payload Types speicified by the "a=rid" line.

   The 'rid' framework MAY be used in combination with the 'a=fmtp' SDP
   attribute for describing the media format parameters for a given RTP
   Payload Type.  However in such scenarios, the 'rid-level' attributes
   (Section 6) further constrains the equivalent 'fmtp' attributes.

   The 'direction' identifies the either 'send', 'recv' directionality
   of the Source RTP Stream.

   A given SDP media description MAY have zero or more "a=rid" lines
   describing various possible RTP payload configurations.  A given
   'rid-identifier' MUST not be repeated in a given media description.

   The 'rid' media attribute MAY be used for any RTP-based media
   transport.  It is not defined for other transports.

   Though the 'rid-level' attributes specified by the 'rid' property
   follow the syntax similar to session-level and media-level
   attributes, they are defined independently.  All 'rid-level'
   attributes MUST be registered with IANA, using the registry defined
   in Section 12

   Section 9 gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form(ABNF) [RFC5234]
   grammar for the "rid" attribute.

   The "a=rid" media attribute is not dependent on charset.

6.  "rid-level' attributes

   This section defines the 'rid-level' attributes that can be used to
   constrain the RTP payload encoding format in a codec-agnostic way.

   The following new SDP parameters shall be defined that represent
   things common across video codecs.

   o  max-width, for spatial resolution in pixels.  In the case that
      stream orientation signaling is used to modify the intended
      display orientation, this attribute refers to the width of the
      stream when a rotation of zero degrees is encoded.

   o  max-height, for spatial resolution in pixels.  In the case that
      stream orientation signaling is used to modify the intended
      display orientation, this attribute refers to the width of the
      stream when a rotation of zero degrees is encoded.

   o  max-fps, for frame rate in frames per second.  For encoders that
      do not use a fixed framerate for encoding, this value should
      constrain the minimum amount of time between frames: the time
      between any two consecutive frames SHOULD not be less than 1/max-
      fps seconds.

   o  max-fs, for frame size in pixels per frame.

   o  max-br, for bit rate in bits per second.  The exact means of
      keeping withing this limit are left up to the implementation, and
      instantaneous excursions outside the limit are permissible.  For
      any given one-second sliding window, however, the total number of
      bits in the payload portion of RTP SHOULD NOT exceed the value
      specific in "max-br."

   o  max-pps, for pixel rate in pixels per second.  This value SHOULD
      be handled identically to max-fps, after performing the following
      conversion: max-fps = max-pps / (width * height).  If the stream
      resolution changes, this value is recalculated.  Due to this
      recalculation, excursions outside the specified maximum are
      possible during near resolution change boundaries.

   All the attributes are optional and are subjected to negotiation
   based on the SDP Offer/Answer rules described in Section 7

   Section 9 provides formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form(ABNF) [RFC5234]
   grammar for each of the "rid-level" attributes defined in this
   section.

7.  SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

   This section describes the SDP Offer/Answer [RFC3264] procedures when
   using the 'rid' framework.

7.1.  Generating the Initial SDP Offer

   For each media description in the offer, the offerer MAY choose to
   include one or more "a=rid" lines to specify a configuration profile
   for the given set of RTP Payload Types.

   In order to construct a given "a=rid" line, the offerer must follow
   the below steps:

   1.  It MUST generate rid-identifier' unique with in a media
       description

   2.  It MUST set the direction for the 'rid-identifier' to one of
       'send' or 'recv'

   3.  A listing of SDP format tokens (usually corresponding to RTP
       payload types) MUST be included to which the constraints
       expressed by the 'rid-level' attributes apply.  The Payload Types
       chosen MUST either be defined as part of "a=rtpmap" or "a=fmtp"
       attributes.

   4.  The Offerer then chooses the 'rid-level' attributes (Section 6)
       to be applied for the SDP format tokens listed.

   5.  If an 'a=fmtp' attribute is also used to provide media-format-
       specific parameters, then the 'rid-level' attributes will further
       constrain the equivalent 'fmtp' parameters for the given Payload
       Type for those streams associated with the 'rid'.

7.2.  Answerer processing the SDP Offer

   For each media description in the offer, and for each "a=rid"
   attribute in the media description, the receiver of the offer will
   perform the following steps:

7.2.1.  'rid' unaware Answerer

   If the receiver doesn't support the 'rid' framework proposed in this
   specification, the entire "a=rid" line is ignored following the
   standard [RFC3264] Offer/Answer rules.  If a given codec would
   require 'a=fmtp' line when used without "a-rid" then the offer still
   needs to include that even when using RID.

Internet-Draft                     rid                      October 2015


7.2.2.  'rid' aware Answerer

   If the answerer supports 'rid' framework, the following steps are
   executed, in order, for each "a=rid" line in a given media
   description:

   1.  Extract the rid-identifier from the "a=rid" line and verify its
       uniqueness.  In the case of a duplicate, the entire "a=rid" line
       is rejected and MUST not be included in the SDP Answer.

   2.  As a next step, the list of payload types are verified against
       the list obtained from "a=rtpmap" and/or "a=fmtp" attributes.  If
       there is no match for the Payload Type listed in the "a=rid"
       line, then remove the "a=rid" line.  The exception being when '*'
       is used for identifying the media format, where in the "a=rid"
       line applies to all the formats in a given media description.

   3.  On verifying the Payload Type(s) matches, the answerer shall
       ensure that "rid-level" attributes listed are supported and
       syntactically well formed.  In the case of a syntax error or an
       unsupported parameter, the "a=rid" line is removed.

   4.  If the 'depend' rid-level attribute is included, the answerer
       MUST make sure that the rid-identifiers listed unambiguously
       match the rid-identifiers in the SDP offer.

   5.  If the media description contains an "a=fmtp" attribute, the
       answerer verifies that the attribute values provided in the "rid-
       level" attributes are within the scope of their fmtp equivalents
       for a given media format.

7.3.  Generating the SDP Answer

   Having performed the verification of the SDP offer as described, the
   answerer shall perform the following steps to generate the SDP
   answer.

   For each "a=rid" line:

   1.  The answerer MAY choose to modify specific 'rid-level' attribute
       value in the answer SDP.  In such a case, the modified value MUST
       be lower (more constrained) than the ones specified in the offer.

   2.  The answerer MUST NOT modify the 'rid-identifier' present in the
       offer.

   3.  The answerer is allowed to remove one or more media formats from
       a given 'a=rid' line.  If the answerer chooses to remove all the

Internet-Draft                     rid                      October 2015


       media format tokens from an "a=rid" line, the answerer MUST
       remove the entire "a=rid" line.

   4.  In cases where the answerer is unable to support the payload
       configuration specified in a given "a=rid" line in the offer, the
       answerer MUST remove the corresponding "a=rid" line.

7.4.  Offering Processing of the SDP Answer

   The offerer shall follow the steps similar to answerer's offer
   processing with the following exceptions

   1.  The offerer MUST ensure that the 'rid-identifiers' aren't changed
       between the offer and the answer.  If so, the offerer MUST
       consider the corresponding 'a=rid' line as rejected.

   2.  If there exist changes in the 'rid-level' attribute values, the
       offerer MUST ensure that the modifications can be supported or
       else consider the "a=rid" line as rejected.

   3.  If the SDP answer contains any "rid-identifier" that doesn't
       match with the offer, the offerer MUST ignore the corresponding
       "a=rid" line.

7.5.  Modifying the Session

   TODO

8.  Usage of 'rid' in RTP

   The RTP fixed header includes the payload type number and the SSRC
   values of the RTP stream.  RTP defines how you de-multiplex streams
   within an RTP session, but in some use cases applications need
   further identifiers in order to effectively map the individual RTP
   Streams to their equivalent payload configurations in the SDP.

   This specification defines a new RTP header extension to include the
   'rid-identifier'.  This makes it possible for a receiver to associate
   received RTP packets (identifying the Source RTP Stream) with a media
   description having the format constraint specificied.

8.1.  RTP 'rid' Header Extension

   The payload, containing the identification-tag, of the RTP 'rid-
   identifier' header extension element can be encoded using either the
   one-byte or two-byte header [RFC5285].  The identification-tag
   payload is UTF-8 encoded, as in SDP.




Thatcher, et al.          Expires April 4, 2016                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                     rid                      October 2015


   As the identification-tag is included in an RTP header extension,
   there should be some consideration about the packet expansion caused
   by the identification-tag.  To avoid Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
   issues for the RTP packets, the header extension's size needs to be
   taken into account when the encoding media.  Note that set of header
   extensions included in the packet needs to be padded to the next
   32-bit boundary using zero bytes [RFC5285]

   It is recommended that the identification-tag is kept short.  Due to
   the properties of the RTP header extension mechanism, when using the
   one-byte header, a tag that is 1-3 bytes will result in that a
   minimal number of 32-bit words are used for the RTP header extension,
   in case no other header extensions are included at the same time.  In
   many cases, a one-byte tag will be sufficient; it is RECOMMENDED that
   implementations use the shortest tag that fits their purposes.

10.1.  Many Bundled Streams using Many Codecs

   In this scenario, the offerer supports the Opus, G.722, G.711 and
   DTMF audio codecs, and VP8, VP9, H.264 (CBP/CHP, mode 0/1), H.264-SVC
   (SCBP/SCHP) and H.265 (MP/M10P) for video.  An 8-way video call (to a
   mixer) is supported (send 1 and receive 7 video streams) by offering
   7 video media sections (1 sendrecv at max resolution and 6 recvonly
   at smaller resolutions), all bundled on the same port, using 3
   different resolutions.  The resolutions include:

   o  1 receive stream of 720p resolution is offered for the active
      speaker.

   o  2 receive streams of 360p resolution are offered for the prior 2
      active speakers.

   o  4 receive streams of 180p resolution are offered for others in the
      call.

   Expressing all these codecs and resolutions using 32 dynamic PTs (2
   audio + 10x3 video) would exhaust the primary dynamic space (96-127).
   RIDs are used to avoid PT exhaustion and express the resolution
   constraints.

      Note: The SDP given below skips few lines to keep the example
      short and focussed, as indicated by either the "..." or the
      comments inserted.

10.2.  Simulcast

   Adding simulcast to the above example allows the mixer to selectively
   forward streams like an SFU rather than transcode high resolutions to
   lower ones.  Simulcast encodings can be expressed using PTs or RIDs.
   Using PTs can exhaust the primary dynamic space even faster in
   simulcast scenarios.  So RIDs are used to avoid PT exhaustion and
   express the encoding constraints.  In the example below, 3
   resolutions are offered to be sent as simulcast to a mixer/SFU.

                                       Example 2


   Offer:
   ...
   m=audio ... same as from Example 1 ..
   ...
   m=video ...same as from Example 1 ...
   ...same rtpmap/fmtp as above...
   a=sendrecv
   a=mid:v1 (max resolution)
   a=rid:1 send pt=*; max-width=1280; max-height=720; max-fps=30
   a=rid:2 recv pt=*; max-width=1280; max-height=720; max-fps=30
   a=rid:5 send pt=*; max-width=640; max-height=360; max-fps=15
   a=rid:6 send pt=*; max-width=320; max-height=180; max-fps=15
   a=simulcast: send rid=1;5;6 recv rid=2
   ...
   ...same m=video sections as Example 1 for mid:v2-v7...
   ...

   Answer:
   ...same as offer but swap send/recv...


10.3.  Scalable Layers

   Adding scalable layers to the above simulcast example gives the SFU
   further flexibility to selectively forward packets from a source that
   best match the bandwidth and capabilities of diverse receivers.
   Scalable encodings have dependencies between layers, unlike
   independent simulcast streams.  RIDs can be used to express these
   dependencies using the "depend" parameter.  In the example below, the
   highest resolution is offered to be sent as 2 scalable temporal
   layers (using MRST).

10.4.  Simulcast with Payload Types

   This example shows a simulcast Offer SDP that uses rid framework to
   identify:

   o  1 send stream at max resolution,

   o  1 recv stream at max resolution,

   o  1 recv stream at low resolution

   and includes 2 "a=simulcast" lines to identify the simulcast streams
   with the Payload Types and rid-identifier respectively.

      Note: The exact rules for the usage of rid framework with
      simulcast is still a work in progress.

11.  Open Issues

11.1.  Name of the identifier

   The name 'rid' is provisionally used and is open for further
   discussion.

   Here are the few options that were considered while writing this
   draft

   o  ESID: Encoded Stream ID, does not align well with taxonomy which
      defines Encoded Stream as before RTP packetization.

   o  RSID or RID: RTP Stream ID, aligns better with taxonomy but very
      vague.

   o  LID: Layer ID, aligns well for SVC with each layer in a separate
      stream, but not for other SVC layerings or independent simulcast
      which is awkward to view as layers.

   o  EPT or XPT: EXtended Payload Type, conveys XPT.PT usage well, but
      may be confused with PT, for example people may mistakenly think
      they can use it in other places where PT would normally be used.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  New RTP Header Extension URI

   This document defines a new extension URI in the RTP Compact Header
   Extensions subregistry of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
   Parameters registry, according to the following data:

       Description:   RTP Stream Identifier
       Contact:       <name@email.com>
       Reference:     RFCXXXX


12.2.  New SDP Media-Level attribute

   This document defines "rid" as SDP media-level attribute.  This
   attribute must be registered by IANA under "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "att-field (media level only)".

   The "rid" attribute is used to identify characteristics of RTP stream
   with in a RTP Session.  Its format is defined in Section XXXX.

12.3.  Registry for RID-Level Attributes

   This specification creates a new IANA registry named "att-field (rid
   level)" within the SDP parameters registry.  The rid-level attributes
   MUST be registered with IANA and documented under the same rules as
   for SDP session-level and media-level attributes as specified in
   [RFC4566].

   New attribute registrations are accepted according to the
   "Specification Required" policy of [RFC5226], provided that the
   specification includes the following information:

   o  contact name, email address, and telephone number

   o  attribute name (as it will appear in SDP)

   o  long-form attribute name in English

   o  whether the attribute value is subject to the charset attribute

   o  a one-paragraph explanation of the purpose of the attribute

   o  a specification of appropriate attribute values for this attribute

   The initial set of rid-level attribute names, with definitions in
   Section XXXX of this document, is given below
