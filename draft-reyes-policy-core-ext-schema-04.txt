Abstract

   This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the
   Policy Core LDAP Schema (RFC zzzz) based on the model extensions
   defined by RFC 3640. These changes and extensions consist of new LDAP
   object classes and attribute types. Some of the schema items defined
   in this document re-implement existing concepts in accordance with
   their new semantics modified by RFC 3640. The other schema items
   implement new concepts, not covered by RFC zzzz.
   This document updates RFC zzzz.

1. Introduction

   This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the
   Policy Core LDAP Schema [PCLS] based on the specifications of the
   Policy Core Information Model Extensions [PCIM_EXT]. These changes
   and extensions consist of new LDAP [LDAP] object classes and
   attribute types. Some of the schema items defined in this document
   re-implement existing concepts in accordance with their new semantics
   modified by [PCIM_EXT]. The other schema items implement new
   concepts, not covered by [PCLS].

   Within the context of this document, the term 'PCELS' (Policy Core
   Extension LDAP Schema) is used to refer to the LDAP object class
   definitions and the associated recommendations contained in this
   document.


2. Relationship to other Policy Framework Documents

   This document contains an LDAP schema mapping for the classes
   defined in the Policy Core Information Model Extensions [PCIM_EXT].
   Other documents may subsequently be produced, with mappings of the
   same [PCIM] extensions to other storage or transport technologies.
   The document is an extension to [PCLS], which defines the mapping
   of the Policy Core Information Model [PCIM] to an LDAP schema.


3. Inheritance Hierarchy for PCELS

   The following diagram illustrates the combined class hierarchy for
   the LDAP object classes defined in [PCLS] and in this document:

4. General Discussion of Mapping the Policy Core Information Model
   Extensions to LDAP

   The object classes described in this document contain certain
   optimizations for a directory that uses LDAP as an access protocol.
   One example is the use of auxiliary class attachment to LDAP entries
   to realize some of the associations defined in the information model.

   Note that other storage types might need to implement the association
   differently.


4.1 Summary of Class and Association Mappings

   The LDAP object classes defined in this document are a direct mapping
   from the corresponding classes and, in some cases, the associations
   defined in [PCIM_EXT]. Similarly, the LDAP attributes defined here
   are a direct mapping from the corresponding class properties. In some
   cases, associations defined in [PCIM_EXT] are simply mapped to
   reference attributes or realized through auxiliary class attachment.

   The classes pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and pcelsVendorValueAuxClass
   are not mapped from [PCIM_EXT], they are new classes added in order
   to increase the framework's capability to store variables and values
   that have not been modeled with specific properties. Just like for
   any other schema elements defined in this document or in [PCLS], a
   particular submodel schema will not, in general, need to use vendor
   specific variable and value classes. Submodel schemas should apply
   the recommendations of section 5.10 of [PCIM_EXT] with regards to
   the supported and unsupported elements.

   While [PCLS] uses the prefix "pcim" for the schema items that it
   defines, the object class and attribute names defined in this
   document are prefixed "pcels".

4.2 Summary of changes since PCLS

   This section provides an overview of the changes relative to [PCLS]
   defined in this document:

   1. The concept of an ordered set of policies is introduced by means
   of two new object classes, pcelsPolicySet and
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation. These classes enable the aggregation and
   relative prioritization of policies (rules and /or groups). The
   attribute pcelsPriority used by the pcelsPolicySetAssociation object
   class indicates the relative priority of the aggregated components.
   The new policy aggregation mechanism provides an alternative to the
   aggregation mechanism defined by [PCLS] (pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass
   and /or pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass attaches to a pcimGroup).

   2. The attribute pcimRoles defined by [PCLS] is used here by the
   pcelsPolicySet object class. Thus, the role based policy selection
   mechanism is extended to all the subclasses of pcelsPolicySet.

   3. A new attribute pcelsDecisionStrategy is added on the
   pcelsPolicySet class as a mapping from the decision mechanism.

INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                      January 2004


   4. A new class pcelsRule (with two subclasses), implements the
   modified semantics of the PolicyRule in accordance with [PCIM_EXT].
   This new class does not include an absolute priority attribute but
   pcelsRule entries can be prioritized relative to each other within
   a System (behavior inherited from its superior: pcelsPolicySet).
   The pcelsRule class also inherits from pcelsPolicySet the ability to
   aggregate other policy rules or groups. Hence, the ability to
   construct nested rule structures of arbitrary complexity.

   5. A new attribute pcelsExecutionStrategy is added to the
   pcelsRule and pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass classes to allow the
   specification of the expected behavior in case of multiple actions
   aggregated by a rule or by a compound action.

   6. Compound Conditions: The pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass class is
   added in order to map the CompoundPolicyCondition class. A new class,
   pcelsConditionAssociation realizes the aggregation of policy
   conditions in a pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass. The same association
   class is used to aggregate policy conditions in a pcelsRule.

   7. Compound Actions: The pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass class is
   added in order to map the CompoundPolicyAction class. A new class,
   pcelsActionAssociation realizes the aggregation of policy actions in
   a pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass. The same association class is used to
   aggregate policy actions in a pcelsRule.

   8. Simple Conditions, Simple Actions, Variables and Values: The
   simple condition, simple action, variable and value classes defined
   by [PCIM_EXT] are directly mapped to LDAP object classes. These are:
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass, pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass,
   pcelsVariable and its subclasses, and pcelsValueAuxClass and its
   subclasses.

   9. A general extension mechanism is introduced for representing
   policy variables and values that have not been specifically modeled.
   The mechanism is intended for vendor-specific extensions.

   10. Reusable Policy Repository: A new class (with two subclasses),
   pcelsReusableContainer is created as a subclass of pcimRepository.
   While maintaining compatibility with older [PCLS] implementations,
   the addition of this class acknowledges the intent of [PCIM_EXT] to
   avoid the potential for confusion with the Policy Framework component
   named Policy Repository. The new class enables many-to-many
   associations between reusable policy containers.

   11. The ReusablePolicy association defined in [PCIM_EXT] is realized
   through subordination to a (subclass of) pcelsReusableContainer.
   Thus, reusable policy components (groups, rules, conditions, actions,
   variables and values) are may be defined as stand-alone entries or
   stand-alone groups of related entries subordinated (DIT contained)
   to a pcelsReusableContainer.

   12. Device level filter classes are added to the schema.

   13. The pcelsRoleCollection class is added to the schema to allow
   the association of policy roles to resources represented as LDAP
   entries.


4.3 Impact on existing implementations of the Policy Core LDAP Schema

   In general, the intent of PCELS is to extend the functionality
   offered by the Policy Core LDAP Schema. For the most part, the
   compatibility with [PCLS] is preserved. The few cases where
   compatibility can not be achieved due to fundamental changes imposed
   by [PCIM_EXT], are defined here as alternatives to the original
   implementation.

   PCELS does not obsolete nor deprecates the concepts implemented by
   [PCLS]. The new LDAP schema items are defined in this document in a
   way that avoids, to the extent possible, interference into the normal
   operation of a reasonably well executed implementation of [PCLS].
   The intent is to permit at least a harmless coexistence of the two
   models in the same data repository.

   It should be noted, however, that the PCELS introduces the following
   changes that may have an impact on some [PCLS] implementations:

   1. Some attributes originally used only by pcimRule are now also used
   by classes unknown to [PCLS] implementations (pcelsPolicySet and
   pcelsRule). In particular the attribute pcimRoles is also used by
   pcelsPolicySet for role based policy selection.

   2. Condition and action association classes originally used by only
   pcimRule are now used (through subclasses) by pcelsRule as well.

   3. pcimRepository containers may include entries of types unknown to
   [PCLS] implementations.

   When the choice exists, PCELS implementations SHOULD support the
   new schema and MAY also support the one defined by [PCLS]. For
   example, if PolicyRule support is required, an implementation SHOULD
   be able to read or read-write (as applicable) pcelsRule entires. The
   same implementation MAY be able to read or read-write pcimRule.

   Note: The provisions of section 5.10. "Conformance to PCIM and PCIMe"
   of [PCIM_EXT] apply to the LDAP schema items defined this document as
   well as to [PCLS].


4.4 The Association of PolicyVariable and PolicyValues
    to PolicySimpleCondition and PolicySimpleAction




Pana, et al.               Expires: July 2004                 [page 13]
INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                      January 2004


   A PolicySimpleCondition as well as a PolicySimpleAction includes a
   single PolicyValue and a single PolicyVariable. Each of them can be
   attached or referenced by a DN.

   The attachment helps create compact PolicyCondition and PolicyAction
   definitions that can be efficiently provisioned and retrieved from
   the repository. On the other hand, referenced PolicyVariables and
   PolicyValues instances can be reused in the construction of multiple
   policies and permit the administrative partitioning of the data and
   policy definitions.


4.5 The Aggregation of PolicyRules and PolicyGroups in PolicySets

   In [PCIM_EXT], the two aggregations PolicyGroupInPolicyGroup and
   PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup, are combined into a single aggregation
   PolicySetComponent. This aggregation and the capability of
   association between a policy and the ReusablePolicyContainer offer
   new possibilities of reusability. Furthermore, these aggregations
   introduce new semantics representing the execution of one PolicyRule
   within the scope of another PolicyRule.

   Since PolicySet is defined in [PCIM_EXT], it is mapped in this
   document to a new class pcelsPolicySet in order to provide an
   abstraction for a set of policy rules or groups. The aggregation
   class PolicySetComponent in [PCIM_EXT] is mapped to a multi-value
   attribute pcelsPolicySetList in the pcelsPolicySet class and the
   attribute pcelsPolicySetDN in the pcelsPolicySetAssociation. These
   attributes refer to the nested rules and groups.

   It is possible to store a rule /group nested in an other rule /group
   in two ways. The first way is to define the nested rule /group as
   specific to the nesting rule /group. The second way is to define the
   nested rules /groups as reusable.

   First case: Specific nested sets (rules /groups).

   The nesting pcelsPolicySet refers to instances of
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation using the attribute pcelsPolicySetList.
   These structural association classes are subordinated (DIT contained)
   to the pcelsPolicySet entry and represent the association between
   the set (rule or group) and its nested rules /groups. The reusable
   rules /groups are instantiated here as auxiliary classes and attached
   to pcimPolicyInstance entries in the reusable container. An other
   option is to use the structural subclasses for defining reusable
   rules /groups. The association classes belonging to a nesting policy
   set are reference the reusable rules /groups using the attribute
   pcelsPolicySetDN.

   A combination of both specific and reusable components is also
   allowed for the same policy set.


4.6 The Aggregation of actions /conditions in PolicyRules and
    CompoundActions /CompoundConditions

   [PCIM_EXT] defines two new classes that offer the designer the
   capability of creating more complex conditions and actions.
   CompoundPolicyCondition and CompoundPolicyActionclasses are mapped
   in this document to pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass and
   pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass classes that are subclasses of
   pcimConditionAuxClass/pcimActionAuxClass. The compound conditions
   /actions defined in [PCIM_EXT] extend the capability of the rule to
   associate, group and evaluate conditions /execute actions. The
   conditions /actions are associated to compounds conditions /actions
   in the same way as they are associated to the rules.

   In this section it is explained how to store instances of these
   classes in an LDAP Directory. As a general rule, specific
   conditions /actions are subordinated (DIT contained) to the rule or
   compound condition /action that aggregates them and are attached
   to association class instances. Reusable conditions /actions, are
   subordinated to pcelsReusableContainer instances and attached to
   pcimPolicyInstance instances.

   The examples below illustrate the four possible cases combining
   specific /reusable compound /non-compound condition /action. The rule
   has two compound conditions, each one has two different conditions.
   The schemes can be extended in order to store actions.

   The examples below are based on and extend those illustrated in
   the section 4.4 of [PCLS].

   - First case: Specific compound condition /action with specific
   conditions /actions.

   Because the compound conditions /actions are specific to the Rule,
   They are auxiliary attachments to instances of the structural
   classes pcelsConditionAssociation or pcelsActionAssociation. These
   structural classes represent the association between the rule and
   the compound condition /action . The rule specific conditions
   /actions are therefore subordinated (DIT contained) to the rule
   entry.

   The conditions /actions are tied to the compound conditions /actions
   in the same way the compound conditions /actions are tied to rules.
   Association classes realize the association between the aggregating
   compound conditions /actions and the specific conditions /actions.

   - Second case: Rule specific compound conditions /actions with
   reusable conditions /actions.

   This case is similar to the first one. The conditions /actions are
   reusable so they are not attached to the association classes but they
   are attached to structural classes in the reusable container. The
   association classes tie the conditions /actions in located in a
   reusable container to their aggregators using DN references.

   -Third case: Reusable compound condition /action with specific
   conditions /actions.

   All the conditions /actions are reusable so they are stored in
   reusable containers. The figure above illustrates two different
   reusable policy containers but the number of containers in the
   system is decided based on administrative reasons. The conditions,
   actions, etc. may be stored in the same container or in different
   containers with no impact on the policy definition semantics.

5. Class Definitions

   The semantics for the policy information classes that are to be
   mapped directly from the information model to an LDAP representation
   are detailed in [PCIM_EXT]. Consequently, this document presents only
   a brief reference to those semantics. The focus here is on the
   mapping from the information model (which is independent of
   repository type and access protocol) to a form that can be accessed
   using LDAP. For various reasons including LDAP specific optimization,
   this mapping is not always 1:1. Some new classes and attributes
   needed to be created (that were not part of [PCIM] or [PCIM_EXT]) to
   implement the LDAP mapping. These new LDAP-only classes are fully
   defined in this document.

   The following notes apply to this section in its entirety.

   Note 1: The formal language for specifying the classes, attributes,
   and DIT structure and content rules is that defined in [LDAP_SYNTAX].
   In the following definitions, the class and attribute definitions
   follow [LDAP_SYNTAX] but they are line-wrapped to enhance human
   readability.

   Note 2: Even though not explicitly noted in the following class and
   attribute definitions, implementations may define DIT structure and
   content rules where applicable and supported by the underlying LDAP
   infrastructure. In such cases, the DIT structure rule considerations
   presented by section 5 of [PCLS] must be applied to PCELS as well.
   The reasons and details are presented in [X.501].

   Note 3: Wherever possible, both an equality and a substring matching
   rule are defined for a particular attribute (as well as an ordering
   match rule to enable sorting of matching results). This provides
   additional implementation flexibility.

   Note 4: The following attribute definitions use only LDAP matching
   rules and syntax definitions from [LDAP_SYNTAX], [LDAP_SCHEMA] and
   [LDAP_MATCH]. The corresponding X.500 matching rules are defined in
   [X.520].

   Note 5: Some of the following attribute definitions specify
   additional constraints on various data types (e.g., this integer has
   values that are valid from 1..10). Text has been added to instruct
   servers and applications what to do if a value outside of this range
   is encountered. In all cases, if a constraint is violated, then the
   policy rule(s) /group(s) SHOULD be treated as being disabled, meaning
   that execution of the policy rule(s) /group(s) SHOULD be stopped.


5.1 The Class pcelsPolicySet





Pana, et al.               Expires: July 2004                 [page 21]

   The abstract class PolicySet is introduced in [PCIM_EXT] to
   provide an abstraction for an ordered set of rules /groups. This is
   mapped here to the pcelsPolicySet object class and may be used for
   identifying group and rule entries. A pcelsPolicySet instance
   aggregates other pcelsPolicySet instances using association entries.
   The association entries enable relative ordering of the aggregated
   pcelsPolicySet instances within the scope of the aggregating
   pcelsPolicySet.

   The pcelsPolicySetList attribute of a pcelsPolicySet instance
   references subordinated pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries.
   The aggregated pcelsPolicySet instances are either attached to the
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries as auxiliary object classes or
   referenced by the pcelsPolicySetAssociation instances using the
   pcelsPolicySetDN attribute.

   The definition of the abstract class pcelsPolicySet follows:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
     NAME 'pcelsPolicySet'
     DESC 'Abstract class that represents an ordered set of policies.'
     SUP pcimPolicy
     ABSTRACT
     MAY ( pcelsPolicySetName
         $ pcelsDecisionStrategy
         $ pcimRoles
         $ pcelsPolicySetList )
   )

   One of the attributes of the pcelsPolicySet class, pcimRoles is
   defined in the section 5.3 of [PCLS]. In the pcelsPolicySet class
   the pcimRole attribute preserves its syntax and semantics as defined
   by [PCLS] and [PCIM].

   The attribute pcelsPolicySetName may be used as naming attribute for
   pcelsPolicySet entries:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
     NAME 'pcelsPolicySetName'
     DESC 'The user-friendly name of a policy set.'
     EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
     ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch
     SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The attribute pcelsDecisionStrategy is used to define the evaluation
   method among the rules in the policy set and is mapped directly from
   the PolicyDecisionStrategy property defined in [PCIM_EXT].

5.2 The Structural Class pcelsPolicySetAssociation

   The pcelsPolicySetAssociation class is used to aggregate instances
   of pcelsPolicySet into other entries. Instances of the
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation class are always subordinated to the
   aggregating entry. When subordinated to a (subclass of)
   pcelsPolicySet, it realizes a (subclass of) PolicySetComponent
   aggregation. When subordinated to (subclass of) dlm1System, the
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation realizes a PolicySetInSystem association.

   The aggregation of a reusable instance of a (subclass of)
   pcelsPolicySet is referenced via the pcelsPolicySetDN attribute. A
   non-reusable instance of (subclass of) pcelsPolicySet is attached as
   auxiliary class directly to the pcelsPolicySetAssociation entry.

   If a pcelsPolicySetAssociation instance has a pcelsPolicySet attached
   to it then the attribute pcelsPolicySetDN SHOULD NOT be present in
   the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this attribute MUST
   be ignored.

5.3 The Three Classes pcelsRule

   The pcelsRule is the base class representing policy rules.
   It re-implements the PolicyRule class with the new semantics
   specified by [PCIM_EXT], therefore without an absolute priority
   attribute but with the means to aggregate other policy (sub)rules.
   The former functionality is inherited from its superclass,
   the pcelsPolicySet.

   This class shares the Condition/Action aggregation methods with the
   pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass and pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass
   object classes.

   If a pcelsRule instance has a pcimConditionAuxClass attached to
   it then the attribute pcelsConditionList SHOULD NOT be present in the
   same entry for the purpose of associating other conditions to the
   rule. However, when such situation occurs the referenced conditions
   MUST NOT be considered as associated to the rule.

   If a pcelsRule instance has a pcimActionAuxClass attached to it
   then the attribute pcelsActionList should not be present in the same
   entry for the purpose of associating other actions to the rule.
   However, when such situation occurs the referenced actions must not
   be considered as associated to the rule.

   Five of the attributes used by the pcelsRule class are defined
   in the section 5.3 of [PCLS]. These attributes are: pcimRuleName,
   pcimRuleEnabled, pcimRuleValidityPeriodList, pcimRuleUsage and
   pcimRuleMandatory. In the pcelsRule object class, these attributes
   preserve their syntax and semantics as defined by [PCLS] and [PCIM].

   Note 1: [PCLS] implements the PolicyRuleValidityPeriod aggregation
   defined by [PCIM] using the attribute pcimRuleValidityPeriodList, the
   class pcimRuleValidityAssociation, (optionally) the attribute
   pcimTimePeriodCondition and the class pcimTPCAuxClass. This mechanism
   is reused here in the context of the pcelsRule object class. As
   result, the class pcimRuleValidityAssociation SHOULD be expected
   (and allowed) to have instances of pcelsRule as superior entries.

   Note 2: The PolicyGroup redefined by [PCIM_EXT] is not explicitly
   mapped to an object class. Instead, for representing ordered sets of
   policy rules, implementations SHALL use pcelsRule instances with no
   associated validity periods, policy conditions or policy actions. If
   submodels define specific PolicyGroup classes, such classes SHOULD
   derive directly from the pcelsPolicySet object class.

   Note 3: For compatibility with [PCIM_EXT] that deprecates the
   absolute priority mechanism, the class pcelsRule SHALL be used
   instead of the class pcimRule defined by [PCLS].


5.4 The Structural Class pcelsConditionAssociation

   The pcelsConditionAssociation class is used to aggregate policy
   conditions in pcelsRule or in pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass.
   Instances of this class are always subordinated to the aggregating
   pcelsRule or pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass. When subordinated
   to a pcelsRule, the pcelsConditionAssociation implements the
   PolicyConditionInPolicyRule aggregation defined by [PCIM_EXT]. When
   subordinated to a pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass, the
   pcelsConditionAssociation implements the
   PolicyConditionInPolicyCondition aggregation defined by [PCIM_EXT].

   The aggregation of a reusable instance of (subclass of)
   pcimConditionAuxClass is referenced via the pcimConditionDN
   attribute. A non-reusable instance of (subclass of)
   pcimConditionAuxClass is attached directly to the
   pcelsConditionAssociation entry.

   If a pcelsConditionAssociation instance has a pcimConditionAuxClass
   attached to it then the attribute pcimConditionDN SHOULD NOT be
   present in the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this
   attribute MUST be ignored.

   section 5.4 of [PCLS].


5.5 The Structural Class pcelsActionAssociation

   The pcelsActionAssociation class is used to aggregate policy
   actions in pcelsRule or in pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass.
   Instances of this class are always subordinated to the aggregating
   pcelsRule or pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass. When subordinated
   to a pcelsRule, the pcelsActionAssociation implements the
   PolicyActionInPolicyRule aggregation defined by [PCIM_EXT]. When
   subordinated to a pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass, the
   pcelsActionAssociation implements the
   PolicyActionInPolicyAction aggregation defined by [PCIM_EXT].

   The aggregation of a reusable instance of (subclass of)
   pcimActionAuxClass is referenced via the pcimActionDN
   attribute. A non-reusable instance of (subclass of)
   pcimActionAuxClass is attached directly to the

   attribute MUST be ignored.

5.6 The Auxiliary Class pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass.

   This class implements a Value matching condition for a Variable.
   The "match" relationship is to be interpreted by analyzing
   the variable and value instances associated with the simple
   condition. Its two attributes realize the
   PolicyValueinSimplePolicyCondition and
   PolicyVariableinSimplePolicyCondition associations defined in
   [PCIM_EXT].

   A reusable variable / value is associated to a
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass via the pcelsVariableDN / pcelsValueDN
   reference from the simple condition entry. A non-reusable variable
   / value is associated directly as auxiliary object class to the
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass entry.

   If a pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass instance has a pcelsVariable
   attached to it then the attribute pcelsVariableDN SHOULD NOT be
   present in the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this
   attribute MUST be ignored.
   If a pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass instance has a pcelsValueAuxClass
   attached to it then the attribute pcelsValueDN SHOULD NOT be
   present in the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this
   attribute MUST be ignored.

   Note: An instance of pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass and an instance of
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass MUST NOT be attached to a same
   entry. Because the two classes use the same mechanisms to
   associate Variables and Values, this restriction is necessary
   in order to avoid ambiguities.


5.7 The Auxiliary Class pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass.

   This class represents a compound policy condition, formed by
   aggregation of other policy conditions. A boolean attribute indicates
   whether the compounded conditions are to be interpreted as
   disjunctive normal form or conjunctive normal form.

   The class definition follows:

   The attribute pcelsConditionListType is used to specify whether the
   list of policy conditions associated with this compound policy
   condition is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) or conjunctive normal
   form (CNF). The attribute pcelsConditionList is an unordered set of
   DN references to conditions aggregated in the compound condition.

5.9 The Auxiliary Class pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass.

   This class implements the action of assigning a Value to a Variable.
   Its two attributes realize the PolicyValueInSimplePolicyAction and
   PolciyVariableInSimplePolicyAction associations defined in
   [PCIM_EXT].

   pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass via the pcelsVariableDN / pcelsValueDN
   reference from the simple action entry. A non-reusable variable
   / value is associated directly as auxiliary object class to the
   pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass entry.

   If a pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass instance has a pcelsVariable
   attached to it then the attribute pcelsVariableDN SHOULD NOT be
   present in the same entry. However, if such situation occurs this
   attribute MUST be ignored.
   If a pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass instance has a pcelsValueAuxClass

   The attributes are defined in section 5.6.

   A instance of pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass and an instance of

   ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association.
   A pcelsVariable entry may be associated to a set of
   pcelsValueAuxClass entries that represent its expected values. The
   expected values for a variable may be indicated by:
      (1) pcelsExpectedValueList references to reusable instances of
          pcelsValueAuxClass or by
      (2) pcelsExpectedValueList references to subordinated non-reusable

   This class represents a container of reusable policy elements. The
   elements contained in a reusable policy container are aggregated via
   subordination to a pcelsReusableContainer instance (DIT containment).
   A reusable policy container can include the elements of an other
   reusable policy container by aggregating the container itself. This
   is realized by DIT containment when the policy containers are
   subordinated to one an other, or by reference when the aggregating
   policy container references the aggregated one using the attribute
   pcelsReusableContainerList.

   The attribute pcelsIPHdrVersion identifies the IP version and
   dictates the format for the IP version dependent attribute values in
   a pcelsIPHeaders entry. These attributes are:
      pcelsIPHdrSourceAddress
      pcelsIPHdrSourceAddressEndOfRange
      pcelsIPHdrSourceMask
      pcelsIPHdrDestAddress
      pcelsIPHdrDestAddressEndOfRange
      pcelsIPHdrDestMask

   If a value for this attribute is not provided, then the filter does
   not consider IP version in selecting matching packets. In this case,
   IP version dependent attributes must not be present in the filter
   entry. The possible values of pcelsIPHdrVersion are '4' and '6'.

5.22 The Auxiliary Class pcelsFilterListAuxClass.

   This class represents a set of device-level filters aggregated
   in a policy condition. Therefore, instances of this class can be
   used in policy rules or as elements of more complex compound
   conditions. The aggregation EntriesInFilterList from the
   [PCIM_EXT] model is implemented by the multi-value attribute
   pcelsFilterEntryList. The EntrySequence property of the aggregation
   EntriesInFilterList that is restricted to its default value ('0')
   in the [PCIM_EXT] model is redundant and therefore not implemented.

   for filter lists:

5.23 The Auxiliary Class pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass.

   This class provides a general extension mechanism for representing
   policy variables that have not been modeled with specific properties.
   Instead, its two properties are used to define the content and format
   of the variable, as explained below. This class is intended for
   vendor-specific extensions that are not amenable to using
   pcelsVariable; standardized extensions SHOULD NOT use this class.

   The class definition is as follows:

   The pcelsVendorVariableData attribute is a multi-valued attribute. It
   provides a general mechanism for representing policy variables that
   have not been modeled as specific attributes. This information is
   encoded in a set of octet strings. The format of the octet strings is

Appendix A: Changes in this revision

   1. This revision does not deprecate schema items defined in PCLS.
   The "Abstract" of this document has been modified accordingly.



Pana, et al.               Expires: July 2004                 [page 60]
INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                      January 2004


   2. To make them easily distinguishable from the object classes and
   attributes defined in PCLS, the schema items defined in this document
   are now prefixed "pcels" instead of "pcim".

   3. In previous versions of this document the pcimPolicyGroup object
   class (initially defined by PCLS) was redefined as a subclass of
   pcimPolicySet (now pcelsPolicySet). This modification has been
   abandoned.

   4. Added note on PolicyGroup representation as pcelsRule or
   pcelsPolicySet.

   5. Abandoned deprecation of pcimRepository and modified
   pcelsReusableContainer to subclass pcimRepository.

   6. Added general considerations in the opening of the schema
   definitions (section 5).

   7. Added text to clarify which attributes defined in PCLS are also
   used in object classes defined here.

   8. Instead of deprecating pcimRuleConditionAssociation and replacing
   it with pcelsConditionAssociation, the latter object class has been
   modified, so that is now a subclass of pcimRuleConditionAssociation
   which is no longer deprecated.

   9. Instead of deprecating pcimRuleActionAssociation and replacing it
   with pcelsActionAssociation, the latter object class has been
   modified, so that is now a subclass of pcimRuleActionAssociation
   which is no longer deprecated.

   10. The class pcimRule and its subclasses defined by PCLS are no
   longer deprecated. A note has been added to clarify the issue
   regarding the functionality replacement for compatibility with
   PCIM_EXT.

   11. The pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass and pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass
   object classes defined by PCLS are no longer deprecated. A note has
   been added to clarify the issue regarding the functionality
   replacement for compatibility with PCIM_EXT.

   12. Added text to explicitly describe the use of
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation for the realization of the
   PolicySetInSystem association. This was unclear in previous
   revisions.

   13. Revised "Summary of changes since PCLS" in accordance with the
   changes listed above.

   14. Revised security considerations.

INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                      January 2004


   15. Updated normative and informative references.

   16. Added section to explain impact on PCLS implementations.

   17. Added note on OID assignment status. (before section 1).

   18. For compliance with NITS, the abstract does not use citations.

   19. Added text to indicate valid and default attribute values where
   applicable.


Appendix B: Open Issues

   1. Should RFC 2119 be cited as normative reference? PCIM_EXT, PCLS
   and other documents refer to RFC 2119 as an informative reference.

   2. The object classes pcelsVendorVariable and pcelsVendorValue
   defined in this document are not mapped from PCIM_EXT.
   Pro: It is estimated that non-standard submodels and their LDAP
   schema implementations will need to define a considerable number of
   new PolicyVariable and PolicyValue subtypes. In order to avoid an
   explosion of LDAP class definitions, the pcelsVendorVariable and
   pcelsVendorValue classes introduce a value based extension mechanism
   for handling new data types. These classes do not introduce a new
   concept but rather a new extension mechanism for an existing concept.
   A similar mechanism is defined by PCIM and implemented by PCLS for
   creating vendor specific PolicyCondition and PolicyAction entries.
   Con: Since PCIM_EXT does not define such classes this document should
   not do it either. The purpose of this document this document is to
   map the PCIM_EXT model to an LDAP schema, therefore such
   functionality is outside its scope.

   3. PolicyGroup is not explicitly mapped to an LDAP object class.
   Pro: Since the PolicyRule has now the capability to aggregate other
   PolicyRule instances, this class includes the functionality of the
   PolicyGroup. Therefore, an explicitly implementation of the
   PolicyGroup class is unnecessary.
   Con: The PolicyRule and the PolicyGroup have different semantics so
   they should be defined using different classes.

   4. pcelsReusableContainer is defined as a subclass of pcimRepository.
   Therefore the new class is an extension to the old one, not an
   alternative to it.
   Pro: As a subclass of pcimRepository, pcelsReusableContainer
   is compatible with older implementations that expect containers of
   reusable policy elements to be implemented as pcimRepository
   entries. The new class extends the functionality of the
   pcimRepository class by implementing the ContainedDomain aggregation.
   Con: pcelsReusableContainer as subclass of pcimRepository has
   potentially detrimental implications on Object Oriented models.

   5. pcelsConditionAssociation is defined as a subclass of
   pcimRuleConditionAssociation. It extends the applicability of
   the old class to the aggregation of PolicyContition instances as
   components of CompoundPolicyContitions.
   Pro: The Condition aggregation mechanism can be reused in both Rule
   and CompoundCondition, therefore making it possible to optimize
   their implementation.
   Con: Mapping of the PCIM_EXT aggregations is implicit therefore more
   difficult for some implementations to detect.
