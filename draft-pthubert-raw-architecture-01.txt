         Reliable and Available Wireless Architecture/Framework
                   draft-pthubert-raw-architecture-01

Abstract

   Due to uncontrolled interferences, including the self-induced
   multipath fading, deterministic networking can only be approached on
   wireless links.  The radio conditions may change -way- faster than a
   centralized routing can adapt and reprogram, in particular when the
   controller is distant and connectivity is slow and limited.  RAW
   separates the routing time scale at which a complex path is
   recomputed from the forwarding time scale at which the forwarding
   decision is taken for an individual packet.  RAW operates at the
   forwarding time scale.  The RAW problem is to decide, within the
   redundant solutions that are proposed by the routing, which will be
   used for each individual packet to provide a DetNet service while
   minimizing the waste of resources.

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework             April 2020


1.  Introduction

   Bringing determinism in a packet network means eliminating the
   statistical effects of multiplexing that result in probabilistic
   jitter and loss.  This can be approached with a tight control of the
   physical resources to maintain the amount of traffic within a
   budgetted volume of data per unit of time that fits the physical
   capabilities of the underlying technology, and the use of time-shared
   resources (bandwidth and buffers) per circuit, and/or by shaping and/
   or scheduling the packets at every hop.

   Wireless networks operate on a shared medium where uncontrolled
   interference, including the self-induced multipath fading, adds
   another dimension to the statistical effects that affect the
   delivery.  Scheduling transmissions can alleviate those effects by
   leveraging diversity in the spatial, time, code, and frequency
   domains, and provide a Reliable and Available service while
   preserving energy and optimizing the use of the shared spectrum.

   Deterministic Networking is an attempt to mostly eliminate packet
   loss for a committed bandwidth with a guaranteed worst-case end-to-
   end latency, even when co-existing with best-effort traffic in a
   shared network.  This innovation is enabled by recent developments in
   technologies including IEEE 802.1 TSN (for Ethernet LANs) and IETF
   DetNet (for wired IP networks).  It is getting traction in various
   industries including manufacturing, online gaming, professional A/V,
   cellular radio and others, making possible many cost and performance
   optimizations.

   The "Deterministic Networking Architecture" [RFC8655] is composed of
   three planes: the Application (User) Plane, the Controller Plane, and
   the Network Plane.  Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) extends
   DetNet to focus on issues that are mostly a co"ern on wireless links,
   and inherits the architecture and the planes.  A RAW Network Plane is
   thus a Network Plane inherited by RAW from DetNet, composed of one or
   multiple hops of homogeneous or heterogeneous technologies, e.g. a
   Wi-Fi6 Mesh or one-hop CBRS access links federated by a 5G backhaul.

   RAW networking aims at providing highly available and reliable end-
   to-end performances in a network with scheduled wireless segments.
   Uncontrolled interference and transmission obstacles may impede the
   transmission, and techniques such as beamforming with Multi-User MIMO
   can only alleviate some of those issues, so the term "deterministic"
   is usually not associated with short range radios, in particular in
   the ISM band.  This uncertainty places limits to the amount of
   traffic that can be transmitted on a link while conforming to a RAW
   Service Level Agreement (SLA) that may vary rapidly.

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework             April 2020


   The wireless and wired media are fundamentally different at the
   physical level, and while the generic "Deterministic Networking
   Problem Statement" [RFC8557] applies to both the wired and the
   wireless media, the methods to achieve RAW must extend those used to
   support time-sensitive networking over wires, as a RAW solution has
   to address less consistent transmissions, energy conservation and
   shared spectrum efficiency.

   The development of RAW technologies has been lagging behind
   deterministic efforts for wired systems both at the IEEE and the
   IETF.  But recent efforts at the IEEE and 3GPP indicate that wireless
   is finally catching up at the lower layer and that it is now possible
   for the IETF to extend DetNet for wireless segments that are capable
   of scheduled wireless transmissions.

   The intent for RAW is to provide DetNet elements that are specialized
   for short range radios.  From this inheritance, RAW stays agnostic to
   the radio layer underneath though the capability to schedule
   transmissions is assumed.  How the PHY is programmed to do so, and
   whether the radio is single-hop or meshed, are unknown at the IP
   layer and not part of the RAW abstraction.

   Still, in order to focus on real-worlds issues and assert the
   feasibility of the proposed capabilities, RAW will focus on selected
   technologies that can be scheduled at the lower layers: IEEE Std.
   802.15.4 timeslotted channel hopping (TSCH), 3GPP 5G ultra-reliable
   low latency communications (URLLC), IEEE 802.11ax/be where 802.11be
   is extreme high throughput (EHT), and L-band Digital Aeronautical
   Communications System (LDACS).  See [RAW-TECHNOS] for more.

   The establishment of a path is not in-scope for RAW.  It may be the
   product of a centralized Controller Plane as described for DetNet.
   As opposed to wired networks, the action of installing a path over a
   set of wireless links may be very slow relative to the speed at which
   the radio conditions vary, and it makes sense in the wireless case to
   provide redundant forwarding solutions along a complex path and to
   leave it to the Network Plane to select which of those forwarding
   solutions are to be used for a given packet based on the current
   conditions.

   RAW distinguishes the longer time scale at which routes are computed
   from the the shorter forwarding time scale where per-packet decisions
   are made.  RAW operates at the forwarding time scale on one DetNet
   flow over one path that is preestablished and installed by means
   outside of the scope of RAW.  The scope of the RAW WG comprises
   Network plane protocol elements such as OAM and in-band control to
   improve the RAW operation at the Service and at the forwarding sub-
   layers, e.g., controlling whether to use packet replication,

   Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) that includes
   Forward Error Correction (FEC) and coding, with a constraint to limit
   the use of redundancy
   whencccccckehblncidtvdigtbfgjiugivbrkkklehrciijk it is really needed,
   e.g., when a spike of loss is observed.  This is discussed in more
   details in Section 5.3 and the next sections.

2.  Terminology

   RAW defines the following terms:

   PAREO:  Packet (hybrid) ARQ, Replication, Elimination and Ordering.
      PAREO is a superset Of DetNet's PREOF that includes radio-specific
      techniques such as short range broadcast, MUMIMO, constructive
      interference and overhearing, which can be leveraged separately or
      combined to increase the reliability.

   Flapping:  In the context of RAW, a link flaps when the wireless
      connectivity is interrupted for short transient times, typically
      of a subsecond duration.

   RAW reuses terminology defined for DetNet in the "Deterministic
   Networking Architecture" [RFC8655], e.g., PREOF for Packet
   Replication, Elimination and Ordering Functions.

   RAW also reuses terminology defined for 6TiSCH in [6TiSCH-ARCH] such
   as the term Track.  6TiSCH defined a Track as a complex path with
   associated PAREO operations.

   In the context of the RAW work, Reliability and Availability are
   defined as follows:

   Reliability:  Reliability is a measure of the probability that an
      item will perform its intended function for a specified interval
      under stated conditions.  For RAW, the service that is expected is
      delivery within a bounded latency and a failure is when the packet
      is either lost or delivered too late.  RAW expresses reliability
      in terms of Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Maximum
      Consecutive Failures (MCF).

   Availability:  Availability is a measure of the relative amount of
      time where a path operates in stated condition, in other words
      (uptime)/(uptime+downtime).  Because a serial wireless path may
      not be good enough to provide the required availability, and even
      2 parallel paths may not be over a longer period of time, the RAW
      availability implies a path that is a lot more complex than what
      DetNet typically envisages (a Track).

3.  Related Work at The IETF

   RAW intersects with protocols or practices in development at the IETF
   as follows:

   *  The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] from [MANET]
      can be leveraged at each hop to derive generic radio metrics
      (e.g., based on LQI, RSSI, queueing delays and ETX) on individual
      hops.

   *  Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) work at [DetNet]
      such as [DetNet-IP-OAM] for the case of the IP Data Plane observes
      the state of DetNet paths, typically MPLS and IPv6 pseudowires
      [DetNet-DP-FW], in the direction of the traffic.  RAW needs
      feedback that flows on the reverse path and gathers instantaneous
      values from the radio receivers at each hop to inform back the
      source and replicating relays so they can make optimized
      forwarding decisions.  The work named ICAN may be related as well.

   *  [BFD] detect faults in the path between an ingress and an egress
      forwarding engines, but is unaware of the complexity of a path
      with replication, and expects bidirectionality.  BFD considers
      delivery as success whereas with RAW the bounded latency can be as
      important as the delivery itself.

   *  [SPRING] and [BIER] define in-band signaling that influences the
      routing when decided at the head-end on the path.  There's already
      one RAW-related draft at BIER [BIER-PREF] more may follow.  RAW
      will need new in-band signaling when the decision is distributed,
      e.g., required chances of reliable delivery to destination within
      latency.  This signaling enables relays to tune retries and
      replication to meet the required SLA.

   *  [CCAMP] defines protocol-independent metrics and parameters
      (measurement attributes) for describing links and paths that are
      required for routing and signaling in technology-specific
      networks.  RAW would be a source of requirements for CCAMP to
      define metrics that are significant to the focus radios.

4.  Use Cases and Requirements Served

   [RFC8578] presents a number of wireless use cases including Wireless
   for Industrial Applications, Pro-Audio and SmartGrid.
   [RAW-USE-CASES] adds a number of use cases that demonstrate the need
   for RAW capabilities for new applications such as Pro-Gaming and
   drones.  The use cases can be abstracted in two families, radio
   access protection and Track protection in a wireless mesh.

4.1.  Radio Access Protection

   To maintain the committed reliability at all times, a wireless host
   may use more than one Radio Access Network (RAN) in parallel.

                                              ***   **
                           RAN 1  -----  ***     **  ***
                        /              *    **         ****
              +----+  /              *           **      ****
              |    |-                *                    *****
              |Host|--zzz- RAN 2 -- *      Internet       *****
              |    |-                 *                  *****
              +----+  $$ù              *              *******
                        \               ***   ***    *****
                           RAN n  --------  ***  *****

           zzz = flapping now  $$$ expensive

                     Figure 1: Radio Access Protection

   The RANs may be heterogeneous, e.g., 5G [I-D.farkas-raw-5g] and Wi-Fi
   [RAW-TECHNOS] for high-speed communication, in which case a Layer-3
   abstraction becomes useful to select which of the RANs are used at a
   particular point of time, and the amount of traffic that is
   distributed over each RAN.

   The idea is that the rest of the path to the destination(s) is
   protected separately (e.g., uses non-congruent paths) and/or is a lot
   more reliable, e.g., wired.  In that case, RAW observes reliability
   of the path through each of the RANs but only operates on the first
   hop.

4.2.  Track Protection in a Wireless Mesh

   A Track (more in Section 6.1) if a multihop multipath radio mesh with
   distribute PAREO capabilities.  In that case, RAW operates through
   the mesh and makes decisions either at the Ingress or at every hop.

                           A-------B-------C-----D
                          /  \   /       /        \

5.  RAW Architecture Considerations

5.1.  Reliability and Availability

5.1.1.  Reliability Engineering

   The reliability criteria of a critical system pervade through its
   elements, and if the system comprises a data network then the data
   network is also subject to the inherited reliability criteria.  It is
   only natural to consider the art of Reliability Engineering and apply
   it to wireless communicaitons in the context of RAW.

   There are 3 pillars in the art of Reliability Engineering:

   1.  Elimination of single points of failure

   2.  Reliable crossover

   3.  Detection of faults as they occur

5.1.2.  Reliability In Wireless Networks

   The terms Reliaility and Availability are defined for RAW in
   Section 2.  Practically speaking a number of nines is often used to
   indicate the reliability of a data link, e.g., 5 nines indicate a
   Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 99.999%. This number is typical is a
   wired environment where the loss is due to a random event such as a
   solar particle that affects the transmission of a particular frame,
   but does not affect the previous or next frame, nor frames
   transmitted on other links.

   For a periodic pattern such as an automation control loop, this
   number is proportional to the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF).  If a
   single fault can have dramatic consequences, then the MTBF is the
   expression of the chances that an unwanted event occurs.  In data
   networks, this is rarely the case.  Packet loss cannot never be fully
   avoided and the systems are built to resist to one loss, e.g., using
   redundancy with Retries (HARQ) or Packet Replication and Elimination
   (PRE), or, in a typical control loop, by linear interpolation from
   the previous measuremnents.

   But the latter method can not resist to multiple consecutive losses,
   and a high MTBF is desired as a guarantee that this will not happen,
   IOW that the losses-in-a-row can be bounded.  In that case, what's
   really desired is a Maximum Consecutive Failures (MCF).  If the
   number of losses in a row passes the MCF, the control loop has to
   abort.  Engineers that build automated processes use the network
   reliability expressed in nines or as an MTBF to provide an MCF.

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework             April 2020


   In contrast with wires networks, errors in transmission are a
   predominent factor for packet loss in wireless.  A given hop will
   suffer from multipath fading for multiple packets in a row till the
   something moves that changes the reflection patterns.  The wireless
   medium itself is a Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) for nearby users of
   the same spectrum, as an interference may affect multiple co-channel
   transmissions between different peers within the interference domain
   of the interferer, possibly even when they use different
   technologies.

   Transmission errors are typically not independent, and there nature
   and duration unpredictable; as long as a physical object (e.g., a
   metallic trolley etween peers) that affects the transmission is not
   removed, or as long as the intererer (e.g., a radar) keeps
   transmitting, packets in a row will be affected.  The key word to
   combat losses is diversity.  A single packet may be sent at different
   times over different paths that rely on different radio frequencies
   and different PHY technologies, e.g., narrowband ns. spread spectrum.
   It is typically retried a nmuber of times in case of a loss, and if
   possible the retries should again vary all possible parameters.  Each
   form of diversity combats a particular cause of loss and use of
   diversity must be maximised to optimize the PDR.

5.2.  Prerequisites

   A prerequisite to the RAW work is that an end-to-end routing function
   computes a complex sub-topology along which forwarding can happen
   between a source and one or more destinations.  For 6TiSCH, this is a
   Track.  The concept of Track is specified in the 6TiSCH Architecture
   [6TiSCH-ARCH].  Tracks provide a high degree of redundancy and
   diversity and enable DetNet PREOF, end-to-end network coding, and
   possibly radio-specific abstracted techniques such as ARQ,
   overhearing, frequency diversity, time slotting, and possibly others.

   How the routing operation computes the Track is out of scope for RAW.
   The scope of the RAW operation is one Track, and the goal of the RAW
   operation is to optimize the use of the Track at the forwarding
   timescale to maintain the expected service while optimizing the usage
   of constrained resources such as energy and spectrum.

   Another prerequisite is that an IP link can be established over the
   radio with some guarantees in terms of service reliability, e.g., it
   can be relied upon to transmit a packet within a bounded latency and
   provides a guaranteed BER/PDR outside rare but existing transient
   outage windows that can last from split seconds to minutes.  The
   radio layer can be programmed with abstract parameters, and can
   return an abstract view of the state of the Link to help forwarding
   decision (think DLEP from MANET).  In the layered approach, how the

   radio manages its PHY layer is out of control and out of scope.
   Whether it is single hop or meshed is also unknown and out of scope.

5.3.  Routing Time Scale vs. Forwarding Time Scale

   With DetNet, the end-to-end routing can be centralized and can reside
   outside the network.  In wireless, and in particular in a wireless
   mesh, the path to the controller that performs the route computation
   and maintenance expensive in terms of critical resources such as air
   time and energy.

   Reaching to the routing computation can also be slow in regards to
   the speed of events that affect the forwarding operation at the radio
   layer.  Due to the cost and latency to perform a route computation,
   the controller plane is not expected to be sensitive/reactive to
   transient changes.  The abstraction of a link at the routing level is
   expected to use statistical operational metrics that aggregate the
   behavior of a link over long periods of time, and represent its
   availability as shades of gray as opposed to either up or down.

                     +----------------+

   In the case of wireless, the changes that affect the forwarding
   decision can happen frequently and often for short durations, e.g., a
   mobile object moves between a transmitter and a receiver, and will
   cancel the line of sight transmission for a few seconds, or a radar
   measures the depth of a pool and interferes on a particular channel
   for a split second.

   There is thus a desire to separate the long term computation of the
   route and the short term forwarding decision.  In such a model, the
   routing operation computes a complex Track that enables multiple Non-
   Equal Cost Multi-Path (N-ECMP) forwarding solutions, and leaves it to
   the forwarding plane to make the per-packet decision of which of
   these possibilities should be used.

   In the case of wires, the concept is known in traffic engineering
   where an alternate path can be used upon the detection of a failure
   in the main path, e.g., using OAM in MPLS-TP or BFD over a collection
   of SD-WAN tunnels.  RAW formalizes a forwarding time scale that is an
   order(s) of magnitude shorter than the controler plane routing time
   scale, and separates the protocols and metrics that are used at both
   scales.  Routing can operate on long term statistics such as delivery
   ratio over minutes to hours, but as a first approximation can ignore
   flapping.  On the other hand, the RAW forwarding decision is made at
   packet speed, and uses information that must be pertinent at the
   present time for the current transmission.

6.  RAW Architecture Components

6.1.  Wireless Tracks

   The "6TiSCH Architecture" [6TiSCH-ARCH] introduces the concept of
   Track a a possibly complex path with the PAREO functions operated
   within.

   A simple track is composed of a direct sequence of reserved hops to
   ensure the transmission of a single packet from a source node to a
   destination node across a multihop path.

   A Complex Track is designed as a directed acyclic graph from a source
   node towards a destination node to support multi-path forwarding, as
   introduced in "6TiSCH Architecture" [6TiSCH-ARCH].  By employing PRE
   functions [RFC8655], several paths may be computed, and these paths
   may be more or less independent.  For example, a complex Track may
   branch off and rejoin over non-congruent paths (branches).

   Some more details for Deterministic Network PRE techniques are
   presented in the following Section.

6.2.  Source-Routed vs. Distributed Forwarding Decision

   Within a large routed topology, the route-over mesh operation builds
   a particular complex Track with one source and one or more
   destinations; within the Track, packets may follow different paths
   and may be subject to RAW forwarding operations that include
   replication, elimination, retries, overhearing and reordering.

   The RAW forwarding decisions include the selection of points of
   replication and elimination, how many retries can take place, and a
   limit of validity for the packet beyond which the packet should be
   destroyed rather than forwarded uselessly further down the Track.

   The decision to apply the RAW techniques must be done quickly, and
   depends on a very recent and precise knowledge of the forwarding
   conditions within the complex Track.  There is a need for an
   observation method to provide the RAW forwarding plane with the
   specific knowledge of the state of the Track for the type of flow of
   interest (e.g., for a QoS level of interest).  To observe the whole
   Track in quasi real time, RAW will consider existing tools such as
   L2-triggers, DLEP, BFD and in-band and out-of-band OAM.

   One possible way of making the RAW forwarding decisions is to make
   them all at the ingress and express them in-band in the packet, which
   requires new loose or strict Hop-by-hop signaling.  To control the
   RAW forwarding operation along a Track for the individual packets,
   RAW may leverage and extend known techniques such as DetNet tagging,
   Segment Routing (SRv6) or BIER-TE such as done with [BIER-PREF].

   An alternate way is to enable each forwarding node to make the RAW
   forwarding decisions for a packet on its own, based on its knowledge
   of the expectation (timeliness and reliability) for that packet and a
   recent observation of the rest of the way across the possible paths
   within the Track.  Information about the service should be placed in
   the packet and matched with the forwarding node's capabilities and
   policies.

   In either case, a per-flow state is installed in all intermediate
   nodes to recognize the flow and determine the forwarding policy to be
   applied.

6.3.  PAREO Functions

   In a nutshell, PRE establishes several paths in a network to provide
   redundancy and parallel transmissions to bound the end-to-end delay
   to traverse the network.  Optionally, promiscuous listening between
   paths is possible, such that the nodes on one path may overhear
   transmissions along the other path.  Considering the scenario shown



Thubert & Papadopoulos   Expires 4 October 2020                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework             April 2020


   in Figure 4, many different paths are possible for S to reach R.  A
   simple way to benefit from this topology could be to use the two
   independent paths via nodes A, C, E and via B, D, F.  But more
   complex paths are possible by interleaving transmissions from the
   lower level of the path to the upper level.

   PRE may also take advantage of the shared properties of the wireless
   medium to compensate for the potential loss that is incurred with
   radio transmissions.  For instance, when the source sends to A, B may
   listen also and get a second chance to receive the frame without an
   additional transmission.  Note that B would not have to listen if it
   already received that particular frame at an earlier timeslot in a
   dedicated transmission towards B.

      Figure 4: A Typical Ladder Shape with Two Parallel Paths Toward
                              the Destination

   The PRE model can be implemented in both centralized and distributed
   scheduling approaches.  In the centralized approach, a Path
   Computation Element (PCE) scheduler calculates the routes and
   schedules the communication among the nodes along a circuit such as a
   Label switched path.  In the distributed approach, each node selects
   its route to the destination, typically using a source routing
   header.  In both cases, at each node in the paths, a default parent
   and alternative parent(s) should be selected to set up complex
   tracks.

   In the following Subsections, all the required operations defined by
   PRE, namely, Alternative Path Selection, Packet Replication, Packet
   Elimination and Promiscuous Overhearing, are described.

6.3.1.  Packet Replication

   The objective of PRE is to provide deterministic networking
   properties: high reliability and bounded latency.  To achieve this
   goal, determinism in every hop of the forwarding paths MUST be
   guaranteed.  By employing a Packet Replication procedure, each node
   forwards a copy of each data packet to multiple parents: its Default
   Parent (DP) and multiple Alternative Parents (APs).  To do so, each
   node (i.e., source and intermediate node) transmits the data packet
   multiple times in unicast to each parent.  For instance, in Figure 5,



Thubert & Papadopoulos   Expires 4 October 2020                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework             April 2020


   the source node S is transmitting the packet to both parents, nodes A
   and B, in two different timeslots within the same TSCH slotframe.  An
   example TSCH schedule is shown in Figure 6.  Thus, the packet
   eventually obtains parallel paths to the destination.

                          ===> (A) => (C) => (E) ===
                        //        \\//   \\//       \\
              source (S)          //\\   //\\         (R) (root)
                        \\       //  \\ //  \\      //
                          ===> (B) => (D) => (F) ===


       Figure 5: Packet Replication: S transmits twice the same data
                  packet, to its DP (A) and to its AP (B).

                                       Timeslot

       | Channel || 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    |
       +---------++======+======+======+======+======+======+======+
       | 0       || S->A | S->B | B->C | B->D | C->F | E->R | F->R |
       +---------++------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
       | 1       ||      | A->C | A->D | C->E | D->E | D->F |      |
       +---------++------+------+------+------+------+------+------+


             Figure 6: Packet Replication: Sample TSCH schedule

6.3.2.  Packet Elimination

   The replication operation increases the traffic load in the network,
   due to packet duplications.  Thus, a Packet Elimination operation
   SHOULD be applied at each RPL DODAG level to reduce the unnecessary
   traffic.  To this aim, once a node receives the first copy of a data
   packet, it discards the subsequent copies.  Because the first copy
   that reaches a node is the one that matters, it is the only copy that
   will be forwarded upward.  Then, once a node performs the Packet
   Elimination operation, it will proceed with the Packet Replication
   operation to forward the packet toward the RPL DODAG Root.

6.3.3.  Promiscuous Overhearing

   Considering that the wireless medium is broadcast by nature, any
   neighbor of a transmitter may overhear a transmission.  By employing
   the Promiscuous Overhearing operation, a DP and some AP(s) eventually
   have more chances to receive the data packets.  In Figure 7, when
   node A is transmitting to its DP (node C), the AP (node D) and its
   sibling (node B) may decode this data packet as well.  As a result,
   by employing corellated paths, a node may have multiple opportunities

   to receive a given data packet.  This feature not only enhances the
   end-to-end reliability but also it reduces the end-to-end delay and
   increases energy efficiency.

                      ===> (A) ====> (C) ====> (E) ====
                    //     ^ | \\                      \\
          source (S)       | |   \\                      (R) (root)
                    \\     | v     \\                  //
                      ===> (B) ====> (D) ====> (F) ====


           Figure 7: Unicast to DP with Overhearing: by employing
      Promiscuous Overhearing, DP, AP and the sibling nodes have more
               opportunities to receive the same data packet.
