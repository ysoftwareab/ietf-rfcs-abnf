      3. Introduction 
       
         MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) routing ([ISIS-TE], [OSPF-TE]) 
         relies on extensions to link state IGP routing protocols ([OSPF], 
         [ISIS]) in order to carry Traffic Engineering link information used 
         for constraint based routing. Further Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
         related extensions are defined in [ISIS-G] and [OSPF-G]. 
          
         The current MPLS-TE/GMPLS routing focuses on TE link information. In 
         return TE router information are limited to the TE router id.  
         However, it would be highly useful to advertise more TE router 
         information for various purposes such as:  
              
             - A Path Computation Elements (PCE) can compute paths for TE-LSPs  
             it is not the head-end for. This can be an LSR or an offline  
             tool not forwarding packets. PCE are useful in various MPLS-TE 
             and GMPLS situations such as, for instance, inter-domain path 
             computation (see [INT-DOMAIN-FRWK]) or backup path computation 
             (see [FACILTY-BACKUP]). It would be highly useful that a node 
       
      Vasseur, Le Roux et al.                                       [Page 3] 
        


      Internet Draft   draft-vasseur-ccamp-te-router-info-00       July 2004 



             advertise its PCE capabilities so as for the LSRs in the network 
             to automatically discover PCEs in addition to their capabilities, 
             and thus would reduce the LSR configuration overhead. This would 
             also allow for the dynamic discovery of a new PCE or that a PCE 
             is not longer alive. 
              
             - A TE mesh group is a group of LSRs that are connected by a full  
             mesh of TE-LSPs. It is useful to advertise the desire of a node  
             to join/leave a particular TE mesh group. This allows for an  
             automatic provisioning of a full mesh of TE LSP, and thus 
             drastically reduces the configuration overhead. 
              
             - Data plane capabilities related to the node itself and not to 
             its links, such as the capability to be a branch node or a bud 
             LSR of a P2MP LSP tunnel (see [P2MP-REQ]). These node 
             capabilities should be advertised by the IGP for path selection. 
             It would also be highly useful to advertise control plane node  
             Capabilities; for instance, the capability to support GMPLS 
             signaling for a packet LSR, or the capability to support P2MP 
             signaling. This would ease backward compatibility. For instance 
             this would allow selecting a path that would avoid nodes that do 
             not support a given signaling feature, or automatically 
             triggering a mechanism that would handle these nodes on the path.  
       
         This document specifies routing extensions in support of carrying 
         Traffic Engineering router information for MPLS Traffic Engineering 
         (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS). Such Traffic Engineering 
         router information will be carried into Link State Advertisements.  
       
         This document specifies a functional description of the extensions 
         required to advertise TE router information and capabilities. Generic 
         routing protocol formats, procedure and definitions are provided in 
         this document whereas protocol specific formats and procedures are 
         defined in [OSPF-CAP], [OSPF-TE-CAP] for OSPF, and in [ISIS-CAP] and 
         [ISIS-TE-CAP] for ISIS. 
          
         The TE Router Information and capabilities defined in this document 
         consists of three pieces of information:  
              -The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV used to advertise    
               data and control plane TE capabilities of an LSR, 
              -The PCE Discovery Information TLV used to advertise PCE  
               capabilities. 
              -The TE Mesh Group Information TLV used to advertise the desire  
              of an LSR to join/leave one or more TE mesh groups. 
          
      4. TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV 
       
         4.1. Description 
       
         LSRs in a network may have distinct control plane and data plane 
         Traffic Engineering capabilities. The TE Node capability Descriptor 
         TLV describes data and control plane capabilities of an LSR. Such 
       
      Vasseur, Le Roux et al.                                       [Page 4] 
        


      Internet Draft   draft-vasseur-ccamp-te-router-info-00       July 2004 



         information can be used for instance for path computation algorithm 
         so as to avoid nodes that do not support a given TE feature either in 
         the control or data plane or to trigger procedure to handle these 
         nodes. In some case, this may also be useful for backward 
         compatibility.  
          
         4.2. Required Information 
          
         The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV contains two variable length 
         sets of bit flags: the Control Plane Capability flags and the Data 
         Plane Capability flags. Each flag corresponds to a given capability. 
          
         Two flags are currently defined in the Data Plane Capability Flags: 
          
         B bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act as a branch 
         node on a P2MP LSP (see [P2MP-REQ]) and [RSVP-P2MP]). 
          
         E bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act as a bud 
         LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. and LSR that is both transit and egress. 
          
          
         Three flags are currently defined in the Control Plane Capability 
         Flags: 
          
         M bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports MPLS-TE 
         signalling ([RSVP-TE]). 
          
         G bit: when set this flag indicates that the LSR supports GMPLS 
         signalling ([RSVP-G]). 
          
         P bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports P2MP MPLS-
         TE signalling ([RSVP-P2MP]). 
          
         Note that new flags may be added if required. 
       
         4.3. Procedure 
       
         The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is carried in Link State 
         Advertisements. A router MUST originate a new Link State 
         Advertisement whenever the content of this information changes, or 
         whenever required by regular routing procedure (e.g. refresh). 
       
         TE Node Capability Descriptor TLVs are optional. When a Link State 
         Advertisement does not contain any TE Node capability Descriptor TLV, 
         this means that the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown. 
          
      5. PCE Discovery Information 
       
         5.1. Description 
       
         The PCE Discovery Information allows for the auto-discovery of one or 
         more Path Computation Element(s). In various MPLS and GMPLS 
       
      Vasseur, Le Roux et al.                                       [Page 5] 
        


      Internet Draft   draft-vasseur-ccamp-te-router-info-00       July 2004 



         situations, such as inter-domain TE or backup path computation, an 
         LSR may require to send a request to a Path Computation Element (PCE) 
         to compute one or more TE LSPs paths obeying a set of specified 
         constraints. Note that a PCE can be an LSR or an offline tool without 
         any forwarding capability. 
          
         The PCE Discovery Information allows a PCE to announce its capability 
         to be a Path Computation Element within an area or an AS. This allows 
         every LSR in the network to automatically discover the PCEs and 
         recognize their capabilities, which substantially simplifies head-end 
         LSR configuration. Moreover, this also allows for: 
              - The dynamic detection of any new PCE,  
              - To determine that PCE is no longer active, 
              - To perform some load sharing among a set of potential PCE 
                candidates.  
          
         5.2. Required Information 
          
         The PCE Discovery Information carries the IP address to be used to 
         reach the PCE. This address will typically be a loop-back address 
         that is always reachable, provided the router is not isolated. The 
         PCE IP address is mandatory, and MUST appear only once, except when 
         the PCE has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address. 
          
         The PCE Discovery Information TLV also carries an optional set of 
         capability flag bits that is used by the PCE to signal its PCE 
         capabilities. This could then be used by an LSR to select the 
         appropriate PCE among a list of PCE candidates.  
          
         Six capability flags are currently defined. The first three bits 
         define the scope for which the PCE is capable of performing the TE 
         LSP Path Computation. 
               
         L bit: 
         Local scope. When set, this flag indicates that the PCE can compute  
         paths for the area/level the PCE Discovery Information TLV is flooded 
         into (the PCE can compute TE LSP paths for intra-area TE LSPs).  
              
         I bit:  
         Inter-area scope. When set, the PCE can perform TE LSP path 
         computation for inter-area TE LSPs but within the same AS.   
              
         A bit:  
         Inter-AS scope. When set, the PCE can perform path computation  
         for inter-AS TE LSPs.  
              
         Note that those flags are not exclusive (a PCE may set one or more  
         flags).  
              
         P bit:  
         Request Priority. The notion of request priority allows a PCC to 
         specify the degree of urgency of a particular request. When set, this 
       
      Vasseur, Le Roux et al.                                       [Page 6] 
        


      Internet Draft   draft-vasseur-ccamp-te-router-info-00       July 2004 



         flag indicates that the PCE takes into account the 'request priority' 
         in its scheduling of the various requests.  
               
         M bit:  
         Multiple Path Computation. When set, this flag indicates that the PCE 
         is capable of computing more than one path obeying a set of specified 
         constraints (in a single pass), provided that they exist.  
              
         D bit: 
         Diversity. When set, this flag indicates that the PCE is capable of 
         computing diversely routed paths (link, node, SRLG). The PCC may 
         request the PCE to compute N diversely routed paths obeying a set of 
         specified constraints. Such N paths may not exist of course depending 
         on the current state of the network.  
              
         Note that new flags may be defined in the future to announce 
         additional PCE capabilities. 
          
         If the PCE is capable of computing inter-AS TE LSP path, the PCE 
         Discovery Information TLV MAY also contain the list of AS numbers 
         identifying the AS for which the PCE can compute inter-AS TE LSP 
         paths (TE-LSPs having their destination address in this AS). This set 
         is optional and should be included only when the A bit is set. 
       
         5.3. Procedure 
       
         The PCE Discovery Information TLV is carried in Link State 
         Advertisements. A router MUST originate a new Link State 
         Advertisement whenever the content of this information changes, or 
         whenever required by regular routing procedure (e.g. refresh) 
          
         The PCE Discovery Information TLV is optional. 
          
         If the PCE can compute an intra-area TE LSP path, the L bit  
         MUST be set. If it can compute an intra-area TE LSP path only for the 
         LSRs in the area it resides in, then the PCE Discovery Information 
         must be contained within an area. Otherwise, if the PCE can compute 
         intra-area TE LSP paths for the whole AS, then the PCE Discovery 
         Information TLV must be flooded across the whole AS.  
       
         If the PCE can compute an inter-area TE LSP path, the I bit MUST be 
         set. If it can compute an inter-area TE LSP path only for the LSRs in 
         the area(s) it resides in (for instance the PCE is an ABR computing 
         an inter-area TE LSP path for its area), then the PCE Discovery 
         Information must be contained within this or these area(s). Else, if 
         it can compute an inter-area TE LSP path for the whole AS, then the 
         PCE Discovery Information must be flooded across the whole AS. 
          
         If the PCE can compute an inter-AS TE LSP path, the A bit MUST be 
         set, and the PCE Discovery Information must be flooded across the 
         whole AS.

      6. TE Mesh Group Information 
       
         6.1. Description 
       
         As of today, there are different approaches in deploying MPLS Traffic  
         Engineering:  
          
                 (1) The 'systematic' approach consisting of setting up a full  
                     mesh of TE LSPs between a set of LSRs,  
          
                 (2) The 'by exception' approach where a set of TE LSPs are  
                     set up on hot spots to alleviate a congestion resulting  
                     for instance in an unexpected traffic growth in some part  
                     of the network.   
          
         Setting up a full mesh of TE LSPs between a set of LSRs requires the  
         configuration of a large number of TE LSPs on every head-end LSR. A  
         full TE mesh of n LSRs requires to set up O(n^2) TE LSPs.  
         Furthermore, the addition of any new LSR in the mesh implies to  
         configure n TE LSPs on the new LSR and to add a new TE LSP on every  
         LSR ending to this new LSR, which gives a total of 2*n TE LSPs. This  
         is not only time consuming but also a risky operation for  
         Service Providers. Hence, a more automatic way of setting up a full  
         mesh of TE LSPs is desirable.  
          
         A TE-mesh group is defined as a group of LSRs fully meshed by a set 
         of LSPs having common TE attributes. An LSR MUST setup a TE-LSP 
         towards each LSR belonging to its TE mesh-group(s).  
          
         The TE Mesh-Group Information allows an LSR to advertise its desire 
         to join/leave one or more TE mesh-groups.  
          
       
         6.2. Required Information 
          
         The TE Mesh Group Information TLV allows an LSR to advertise the set 
         of TE mesh-groups it belongs to. For each mesh group announced by the 
         LSR, the TE Mesh Group Information TLV carries the following set of 
         information: 
              -A Mesh-Group number identifying the TE mesh-group, 
              -A Tail-end address (address used as a tail end address by other 
              LSRs belonging to the same mesh-group), 
              -A Tail-end name: string used to ease the TE-LSP naming (e.g. 
              'head-name->tail-name'). 
       
         6.3. Procedure 
       
         The TE Mesh-Group Information TLV is carried in Link State 
         Advertisements. A router MUST originate a new Link State 
         Advertisement whenever the content of this information changes, or 
         whenever required by regular routing procedure (e.g. refresh)

      Internet Draft   draft-vasseur-ccamp-te-router-info-00       July 2004 



         The TE Mesh-Group Information is optional. 
          
         If the TE Mesh Group is contained within a single area, the TE Mesh 
         Group Information TLV must be advertised with an area scope for OSPF 
         and MUST not be leaked across levels for IS-IS. 
          
         Conversely, if the TE Mesh Group spans multiple IGP areas, the TE 
         Mesh Group Information TLV must be advertisement with a routing 
         domain scope for OSPF and MUST be leaked across levels for IS-IS. 
          
      7. Security Considerations 
       
         No new security issues are raised in this document.
