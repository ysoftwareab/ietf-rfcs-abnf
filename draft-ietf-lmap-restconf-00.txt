1.  Introduction

   This document discusses how a controller can use the RESTCONF
   protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] to configure Large-Scale
   Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) measurement agents (MAs)
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].  It also discusses how RESTCONF can be
   used to report measurement results to a collector.

   MAs may be deployed as separate hardware devices or as functions
   embedded in consumer electronic devices and home routers or as pure
   software solutions that can be installed on off-the-shelf computing
   equipment.  Measurement agents receive instructions from a controller
   about when and how to conduct what measurements (the measurement
   schedule) and how and when to report measurement results to a data
   collector (the report schedule).  Further information about the
   interaction between MAs and controllers and collectors can be found
   in [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].

   The LMAP information model [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] defines
   the information exchanged between a controller and an MA and the
   information exchanged between an MA and a collector.  An information
   model is conceptual and protocol-independent.  A concrete YANG
   [RFC6020] data model derived from the conceptual information model is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-lmap-yang].

2.  Overview of RESTCONF

   The RESTCONF protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] provides a REST-
   like interface to access and manipulate a so-called unified YANG
   datastore [RFC6020].  The basic idea behind RESTCONF is expose a YANG
   datastores as a collection of Web resources that can be manipulated
   using standard HTTP [RFC7230] DELETE, PATCH, POST, and PUT methods.

Internet-Draft               LMAP Data Model                   July 2015


   The resource hierarchy is derived from the nesting structure of the
   YANG schema tree, leading to a so called data model driven REST API.

   RESTCONF is essentially a convention how to use HTTP over TLS to
   access a datastore that has a structure defined by a YANG data model.
   The data is exchanged in XML encoding or JSON encoding.

   The normal mode of operation is that the RESTCONF client initiates a
   secure transport to the RESTCONF server.  For devices located behind
   a NAT, a so called 'call-home' mechanism has been defined
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-call-home] that enables the RESTCONF server to
   establish a secure transport to a RESTCONF client.  Note that call
   home only changes the TCP connection establishment, the TLS and HTTP
   client/server roles do not change.  The policy used to call home can
   be configured through a configuration data model
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-server-model].  This model provides mechanism to
   configure a list of redundant endpoints and it provides control over
   call-home policies (e.g, call-home frequency, idle-timers, keep-alive
   timers).

3.  RESTCONF as LMAP Control Protocol

   It is straight-forward to user RESTCONF as a control protocol.  The
   YANG data model [I-D.ietf-lmap-yang] derived from the underlying
   information model [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] translates into a
   collection of RESTCONF resources that can be manipulated at various
   levels of granularity using DELETE, PATCH, POST, and PUT methods.

   An example exchange showing a REST call to create a schedule object
   is shown in Appendix B.

4.  RESTCONF as LMAP Report Protocol

   One way of mapping the information model parts relevant for reports
   into a YANG data model is the usage of YANG notifications.  This is
   the approach currently used in [I-D.ietf-lmap-yang].  This mapping
   leads to report notifications that push measurement results from the
   MA to a collector.  The RESTCONF protocol uses Server Sent Events as
   the underlying mechanism to stream notifications.

   A direct mapping of the information model leads to relatively verbose
   exchanges and it is possible to define more space efficient
   notifications that suppress information that is only changing rarely.

   An example exchange of a result notification is shown in Appendix C.

   Note that alternative designs are possible.  One option is to make
   the collector a RESTCONF server and to have the MA push results to

Internet-Draft               LMAP Data Model                   July 2015


   the collector by posting to resources on the controller.  Another
   option is to have the results reside on the MA and to export the
   results as part of the operational state of the MA.  The collector(s)
   will then use GET requests to fetch the result resources from the MA.
   Note that all three approaches can be implemented using RESTCONF and
   YANG.

5.  Conclusion

   This document discusses how RESTCONF can be used as a control
   protocol and a report protocol for Large-Scale Measurement Platforms
   (LMAP).  The benefit of using RESTCONF is that no new protocol work
   needs to be done.  Additional benefits derive from using YANG and a
   data model driven approach.  Despite the reuse of existing tools,
   using a data model driven approach allows to easily reuse other data
   models (e.g., network interfaces [RFC7223], [RFC7277] or general
   system services [RFC7317]) in order to export additional status
   information about an MA to a controller.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The first step taken by the collector is to lookup the event stream
   resource.
