   a security association with its Home Agent before it can start
   utilizing Mobile IPv6.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these
   parameters are statically configured.  Ongoing Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping work aims to make this information dynamically
   available to the Mobile Node.  An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping solution is to support interworking with existing
   authentication, authorization and accounting infrastructure.  This
   document describes the MIPv6 bootstrapping using the Diameter Network
   Access Server (NAS) <-> home Authentication, Authorization and
   Accounting server (HAAA) interface.

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6 NAS - HAAA Interface      January 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) specification [RFC3775] requires a Mobile
   Node (MN) to perform registration with a Home Agent (HA) with
   information about its current point of attachment (Care-of Address).
   The HA creates and maintains binding between the MN's Home Address
   and the MN's Care-of Address.

   In order to register with a HA, the MN needs to know some information
   such as, the Home Link prefix, the HA address, the Home Address(es),
   the Home Link prefix Length and security association related
   information.

   The aforementioned set of information may be statically provisioned
   in the MN.  However, static provisioning of this information becomes
   easily provisioning and network administratiOn burden for an
   operator.  Moreover, static provisioning does not address load
   balancing, failover, opportunistic home link assignment and assigment
   of local home agents in close proximity to the MN.  Also the ability
   to react on sudden environmental or topological changes is minimal.
   In a light of above issues static provisioning may not be desirable.

   Dynamic assignment of MIPv6 home registration information is a
   desirable feature for ease of deployment and network maintenance.
   For this purpose, the AAA infrastructure, which is used for access
   authentication, can be leveraged to assign some or all of the
   necessary parameters.  The Diameter server in Access Service
   Provider's (ASP) or in Mobility Service Provider's (MSP) network may
   return these parameters to the AAA client.  Regarding the
   bootstrapping procedures, the AAA client might either be the NAS, in
   case of the integrated scenario, or the HA, in case of the split
   scenario [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-split].  The terms integrated
   and split are described in the terminology section and were
   introduced in [RFC4640] and [I-D.ietf-mip6-aaa-ha-goals].


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   General mobility terminology can be found in [RFC3753].  The
   following additional terms, as defined in [RFC4640], are used in this
   document:

   Access Service Authorizer (ASA):

      A network operator that authenticates a MN and establishes the
      MN's authorization to receive Internet service.

   Access Service Provider (ASP):

      A network operator that provides direct IP packet forwarding to
      and from the MN.

   Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA):

      A service provider that authorizes MIPv6 service.

   Mobility Service Provider (MSP):

      A service provider that provides MIPv6 service.  In order to
      obtain such service, the MN must be authenticated and authorized
      to obtain the MIPv6 service.

   Split scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by different entities.

   Integrated Scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by the same entity.

   Network Access Server (NAS):

      A device that provides an access service for a user to a network.

   Home AAA (HAAA):

      An authentication, authorization and accounting server located in
      user's home network.


3.  Overview

   This document addresses the authentication, authorization and
   accounting functionality required by for the MIPv6 bootstrapping as
   outlined in the MIPv6 bootstrapping problem statement document
   [RFC4640].  This document focuses on the Diameter based AAA
   functionality for the NAS - HAAA interface.

   In the integrated scenario MIPv6 bootstrapping is provided as part of
   the network access authentication procedure.  Figure 1 shows the
   participating entities.  This document, however, only concentrates on
   the NAS, possible local Diameter proxies and the home Diameter
   server.

      Figure 1: Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in the Integrated Scenario

   In a typical MIPv6 access scenario the MN is attached to an ASP's
   network.  During the network attachment procedure, the NAS/Diameter
   client interacts with the MN.

   During the time of authentication the Diameter server in the MSA
   detects that the user is also authorized for MIPv6 access.  Based on
   the MSA's policy, the Diameter server may return several MIPv6
   bootstrapping related parameters.

   Depending on the details of the bootstrapping solution interaction
   with the DHCPv6 server may be required, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc].  However, the Diameter
   based NAS - HAAA interface described in this document is not tied to
   DHCPv6 as the only possible MIPv6 bootstrapping method.

4.  Commands, AVPs and Advertising Application Support

   This section describes command codes, defines AVPs and advertised
   application identifiers for the Diameter MIPv6 bootstrapping in the
   NAS - HAAA interface.

4.1.  Advertising Application Support

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification SHOULD include the
   value of 1 (NASREQ application) or 5 (EAP application) in the Auth-
   Application-Id or the Acct-Application-Id AVP in the Capabilities-
   Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands [RFC3588].

4.2.  Command Codes

   This document re-uses the Diameter NASREQ application [RFC4072] and
   the EAP application commands [RFC4005].  The following commands are
   used to carry MIPv6 related bootstrapping AVPs:


   Command-Name             Abbrev.   Code     Reference  Application

   Diameter-EAP-Request      DER       268      RFC 4072   EAP
   Diameter-EAP-Answer       DEA       268      RFC 4072   EAP

   AA-Request                AAR       265      RFC 4005   NASREQ
   AA-Answer                 AAA       265      RFC 4005   NASREQ


     Figure 2: MIPv6 Bootstrapping NAS - HAAA Interface Command Codes

   When the Re-Auth-Request (RAR), Re-Auth-Answer (RAA), Session-
   Termination-Request (STR), Session-Termination-Answer (STA), Abort-
   Session-Request (ASR), Abort-Session-Answer (ASA), Accounting-Request
   (ACR), and Accounting-Answer (ACA) commands are used together with
   the MIPv6 bootstrapping NAS - HAAA interface, they follow the rules
   in the Diameter NASREQ [RFC4005], EAP [RFC4072] and RFC 3588
   [RFC3588] applications.  The accounting commands use the Application
   Identifier value of 3 (Diameter Base Accounting); the others use 0
   (Diameter Common Messages).

4.3.  Diameter-EAP-Request (DER)

   The Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) command [RFC4072], indicated by the
   Command-Code field set to 268 and the 'R' bit set in the Command
   Flags field, may be sent by the NAS to the Diameter server providing
   network access authentication and authorization services.  At the
   same time with the network access authentication and authorization

   the NAS MAY indicate the access network capability of MIPv6
   bootstrapping and optionally also the capability of a local HA
   assignment.

   The message format is the same as defined in [RFC4072] with an
   addition of optional MIPv6 bootstrapping NAS - HAAA interface AVPs to
   indicate capabilities of the NAS and the ASP:

   The Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA) message define in [RFC4072], indicated
   by the Command-Code field set to 268 and 'R' bit cleared in the
   Command Flags field is sent in response to the Diameter-EAP-Request
   message (DER).  If the network access authentication procedure was
   successful then the response MAY include any set of MIP6-Home-Agent-
   Address AVP, MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix, MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN, MIP6-Home-
   Address and MIP4-Home-Agent-address AVPs.

   The message format is the same as defined in [RFC4072] with an

4.6.  AA-Answer (AAA)

   The AA-Answer (AAA) message, indicated by the Command-Code field set
   to 265 and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field is sent in
   response to the AA-Request (AAR) message for confirmation of the
   result of MIPv6 HA bootstrapping.  If the network access
   authentication procedure was successful then the response MAY include
   any set of MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP, MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix, MIP6-
   Home-Agent-FQDN, MIP6-Home-Address and MIP4-Home-Agent-address AVPs.

   The message format is the same as defined in [RFC4005] with an
   addition of optional MIPv6 bootstrapping NAS - HAAA interface AVPs:

4.7.  Attribute Value Pair Definitions

4.7.1.  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString
   and contains the MIPv6 HA address and the prefix length of the said
   address.  The AVP is a discriminated union, representing IPv6 address
   in network byte order.  The first two octets of this AVP represents
   the home link prefix length followed by 16 octets of the IPv6
   address.

   The Diameter server MAY decide to assign a MIPv6 HA to the MN that is
   in close proximity to the point of attachment (e.g. determined by the
   NAS-Identifier).  There may be other reasons for dynamically
   assigning HAs to the MN, for example to share the traffic load.  The
   AVP also contains the prefix length so that the MN can easily infer
   one of the possible Home Link prefixes from the HA address.

   This AVP MAY also be sent by the NAS to the Diameter server in a
   request message as a hint to suggest a dynamic HA may be assigned to
   the MN.  Based on local policy information the Diameter server may
   decide to follow the hint or to override this suggestion with its
   preferred HA IP address.

4.7.2.  MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type UTF8String and
   contains the FQDN of a MIPv6 HA.  The usage of this AVP is equivalent



Korhonen (ed.), et al.    Expires July 27, 2007                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6 NAS - HAAA Interface      January 2007


   to the MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP except that the host using the
   FQDN needs to perform a DNS query in order to discover the HA
   address.

4.7.3.  MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString
   and contains the MIPv6 home link prefix.  There may be reasons for
   the Diameter server to dynamically assigning home link prefix to the
   MN, for example one that is in close proximity to the point of
   attachment.

   The MN can perform RFC 3775 [RFC3775] specific procedures to discover
   other information for MIPv6 registration.

4.7.4.  MIP4-Home-Agent-Address AVP

   The MIP4-Home-Agent-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString
   and contains the IPv4 HA address and the prefix length of the said
   address.  The AVP is a discriminated union, representing IPv4 address
   in network byte order.  The first two octets of this AVP represents
   the home link prefix length followed by 4 octets of the IPv4 address.

   The Diameter server MAY decide to assign a MIPv4 HA to the MN in a
   case where dual stack Mobile IP is supported
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-nemo-v4traversal].

4.7.5.  MIP6-Home-Address AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains the MIPv6 Home Address and the prefix length of the said
   address.  The AVP is a discriminated union, representing IPv6 address
   in network byte order.  The first two octets of this AVP represents
   the Home Address prefix length followed by 16 octets of the IPv6
   address.

   The Diameter server MAY assign a home address to the MN.  This allows
   the network operator to support MNs that are not configured with
   static addresses.  The attribute also contains the prefix length so
   that the MN can easily infer the home link prefix from the HA
   address.

4.8.  Capability Advertisement

   The NAS/ASP may include any MIPv6 bootstrapping AVPs in the DER or
   AAR messages in order to advertise its MIPv6 bootstrapping
   capabilities to the Diameter server.  This capability advertisement
   may also be used to propose locally allocated mobility agents,



Korhonen (ed.), et al.    Expires July 27, 2007                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6 NAS - HAAA Interface      January 2007


   locally allocated prefix or home address to the Diameter server.  As
   an example the MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP could contain the IP
   address of the locally allocated HA.

   If the MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP is only used as a MIPv6
   bootstrapping capability indicator then the IP address MUST be set to
   unspecified address (::/128).  The MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP SHOULD
   NOT be used for the capability advertisement if it does not name a
   locally allocated HA.


5.  Diameter Client and Server Behavior During MIPv6 Bootstrapping

   This section describes the Diameter server and client behavior in
   case of the MIPv6 bootstrapping in the integrated scenario.  The text
   makes several assumptions.

   o  The Diameter server supports at least the Diameter BASE, EAP and
      NASREQ applications.
   o  The Diameter client (i.e., the NAS) supports at least the Diameter
      BASE, EAP and NASREQ applications.
   o  The MN uses such network access authentication method and
      credentials that are supported by the NAS/ASP and ASA/MSA.
   o  The MN has been provisioned with a MIPv6 service.

5.1.  Client (NAS) Behavior

   If the ASP/NAS does not support MIPv6 integrated scenario
   bootstrapping then the NAS either selects the basic Diameter NASREQ
   or EAP application depending on which authentication method gets
   used.  Naturally after a successful or a failed authentication the
   NAS does not have to carry out any MIPv6 bootstrapping related
   procedures.

   Next, we describe two different scenarios for the network access
   authentication when the ASP/NAS supports MIPv6 integrated scenario
   bootstrapping.

   1) The MN uses some EAP-based method for network access
      authentication.  In this scenario the NAS uses commands originally
      defined for the EAP application.
   2) The MN uses a non-EAP-based network access authentication
      procedure.  In this scenario the NAS uses the Diameter NASREQ
      application commands.

   The NAS may include the MIPv6 NAS - HAAA AVPs in the DER or in the
   AAR messages.  This serves two purposes.  Firstly the NAS/ASP may
   advertise its MIPv6 bootstrapping capability to the Diameter server.



Korhonen (ed.), et al.    Expires July 27, 2007                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6 NAS - HAAA Interface      January 2007


   Secondly the NAS/ASP may suggest locally allocated HAs to the
   Diameter server.  Whether the locally allocated HAs are allowed for
   the forthcoming MIPv6 session depends on the MN's subscription and
   the ASA/MSA(/MSP) policies.  If the NAS/ASP only wants to advertise
   its capability for local agent allocation but does not want to
   provide any specific agent at this point of time (e.g. that is left
   for later steps during the actual Mobile IP registration) the AVPs
   MUST contain values described in Section 4.8.

   If the network access authentication failed the NAS receives
   appropriate error codes as defined for the Diameter EAP or NASREQ
   applications.  The NAS does not allow the MN to access the network
   and does not do any MIPv6 bootstrapping related procedures.

   If the network access authentication completed successfully, the NAS
   looks for HA defining AVPs in the reply messages (either DEA or AAA
   depending on the used authentication method).  The NAS associates the
   received bootstrapping information to the MN that initiated the
   access authentication and stores the information internally (storing
   time is determined by the ASP policy).  The stored bootstrapping
   information is then available for the NAS and the DHCP relay for
   later step during the MN bootstrapping process.

   The actual bootstrapping from the MN point of view takes place after
   the network access authentication has completed.  The bootstrapping
   may be realized e.g. using DHCP as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] and [RFC2132].

   The MN has no consistent way of indicating to the NAS that it
   supports MIPv6 integrated scenario way of bootstrapping during the
   network access authentication.  Subsequently the NAS has no
   possibilities to find out whether the terminal attempting to
   authenticate is actually a MN with MIPv6 bootstrapping functionality
   prior the network access authentication has completed.  Thus, it is
   possible that the NAS initiates MIPv6 integrated scenario
   bootstrapping configuration even if the MN is not able to make any
   use of it later.  The Diameter server in the ASA/MSA might be able to
   detect this situation during the authentication phase based on the
   information in the subscriber database assuming the ASA is able to
   verify whether the MN has been provisioned with a MIPv6 service (from
   the MSA/MSP).

5.2.  Server Behavior

   If the NAS/ASP does not support MIPv6 integrated scenario
   bootstrapping then the NAS either selects the Diameter NASREQ or EAP
   application depending on which access authentication method the MN
   has to use to authenticate.  In this case the NAS does not either



Korhonen (ed.), et al.    Expires July 27, 2007                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6 NAS - HAAA Interface      January 2007


   include any MIPv6 NAS - HAAA interface AVPs as a hint of the
   bootstrapping capability in the NAS/ASP.  The Diameter server in the
   ASA/MSA(/MSP) detects this case (based on AVPs that serve as a
   capability hint) and does not have to carry out any MIPv6
   bootstrapping related procedures.  However, as the capability
   advertisement mechanism described in this document serves only as an
   optional hint, the Diameter server should not entirely rely on the
   received capability hints but also base its working logic on
   subscription information and general MSA(/MSP) policies.

   Next we describe two different scenarios for the network access
   authentication when the NAS/ASP supports MIPv6 integrated scenario
   bootstrapping.

   1) The MN uses some EAP-based method to authenticate to the network
      and the NAS uses Diameter EAP application commands.  Depending on
      the ASA/MSA(/MSP) policy the Diameter server SHOULD assign a MIPv6
      HA to the MN and include corresponding MIP6-Home-Agent-Address,
      the MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVPs and the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix in the
      final DEA message.
   2) The MN uses some other than EAP-based method to authenticate to
      the network and the NAS uses Diameter NASREQ application commands.
      Depending on the ASA/MSA(/MSP) policy the Diameter server SHOULD
      assign a MIPv6 HA to the MN and include corresponding MIP6-Home-
      Agent-Address, the MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVPs and the MIP6-Home-
      Link-Prefix in the final AAA message.

   If the Diameter request message contained any MIPv6 NAS -HAAA
   interface AVPs the Diameter server should regard them as a hint of
   the MIPv6 bootstrapping capability in the NAS/ASP.  Any of these AVPs
   may contain values as described in Section 4.8 which indicate the
   NAS/ASP would like to locally allocate a HA or a home link to the MN.
   The Diameter server may or may not honor the NAS/ASP hint based on
   the MN's subscription and ASA/MAS(/MSP) policies.


6.  Example Message Flows

6.1.  EAP-based authentication

   This section shows basic message flows of MIPv6 integrated scenario
   bootstrapping and dynamic HA assignment.  In the Figure 7 network
   access authentication is based on EAP (e.g. 802.11i/802.1X).  The NAS
   informs the home Diameter server that HA assignment in the foreign
   network is possible.  The Diameter server assigns the MN a HA either
   in the home MSP or in the ASP.  The assignment procedure is out of
   scope of this document.  The Diameter server then replies to the NAS
   with HA related bootstrapping information.

6.2.  Integrated scenario and HA allocation in MSP

   Diameter is used to authenticate and authorize the MN for the
   mobility service, and to send information about the allocated HA to
   the NAS.  In this example scenario the MN uses DHCP for its IP
   address configuration.

                      Figure 8: HA allocation in MSP

   1) The MN executes the normal network access authentication procedure
      (IEEE 802.11i/802.1X, PANA, ...) with the NAS.  The NAS acts as an
      authenticator in "pass-through" mode.  The other endpoint of the
      authentication dialogue is the MN's home Diameter server.  This is
      a typical scenario for e.g.  EAP-based authentication methods.
      The NAS includes at least one of the NAS-HAAA interface AVPs in
      the DER or in the AAR messages to indicate MIPv6 bootstrapping
      capability.  For example the NAS could include MIP6-Home-Agent-
      Address AVP with 0::/128 as the HA address (the NAS has no
      particular HA to propose to the Diameter server).

   2) Depending on the Diameter server configuration and the
      subscription profile, the MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP or the MIP6-
      Home-Agent-FQDN AVP may be appended to the DEA or to the AAA
      message, assuming the home Diameter server knows or has allocated
      a HA to the MN.  In case the MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP was returned
      the MN ultimately needs to perform a DNS query in order to
      discover the HA address.  For example the home Diameter server

      could return the following AVPs:

      o  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address = 2001:2001:6000:302::1/64
      o  MIP6-Home-Address = 2001:2001:6000:302::dead:beef/64
      o  MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix = 2001:2001:6000:302::/64

   3) the MN sends a DHCPv6 Information Request message to
      all_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers address.  In the OPTION_ORO,
      Option Code for the Home Network Identifier Option shall be
      included in that message
      [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc].  The Home Network

      request to discover home network information that pertains to the
      given realm, i.e., the user's home domain (identified by the NAI
      of the MN).  The OPTION_CLIENTID is set by the MN to identify
      itself to the DHCP server.

   Steps 4 to 6 are not relevant in NAS-HAAA Diameter interface point of
   view and are not described in this document.  Refer
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] for detailed information
   about the rest of the integrated scenario bootstrapping procedure.

6.3.  Integrated scenario and HA allocation in ASP

   This scenario is similar to the one described in Section 6.2 and
   illustrated in Figure 8.  There are slight differences in steps 2)
   and 3).

   2) The NAS/ASP has allocated a local HA (e.g. with IP address 2001:
      788:1:c020::1/64) and a local prefix, and proposes those to MN's
      home Diameter server.  For example the NAS includes following AVPs
      in the DER or in the AAR messages:

      o  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address = 2001:788:1:c020::1/64
      o  MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix = 2001:788:1:c020::/64

      Depending on the Diameter server configuration and the
      subscription profile, the Diameter server either accepts or
      rejects the HA IP address (or FQDN) proposed by the NAS/ASP.  If
      the Diameter server accepts the proposed HA the AVP containing the
      HA information is returned as is back to the NAS.  In this example
      the returned IP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP would contain the same
      2001:788:1:c020::1/64 IP address value.  On the orher hand if the
      Diameter server does not accept the proposed HA, the Diameter
      server overwrites the MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP value with an IP
      address of the preferred HA (e.g. 2001:2001:6000::1/64) and
      returns the new IP address back to the NAS/ASP (the MIP6-Home-
      Agent-FQDN AVP is handled in the same way when present).  This is

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6 NAS - HAAA Interface      January 2007


      also an indication to the NAS/ASP that locally allocated HAs are
      not to be used.  In a case when the home Diameter server accepted
      the NAS/ASP proposed local HA the home Diameter server would
      return e.g. the following AVPs:

      o  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address = 2001:788:1:c020::1/64
      o  MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix = 2001:788:1:c020::/64

   3) The type-id field in the Home Network Identifier Option is set to
      zero, indicating that a HA is requested in the ASP instead of in
      the MSP.  Depending on the result of the phase 2) the DHCP relay
      agent places in the OPTION_MIP6-RELAY-Option either the locally
      allocated HA information or the HA information that was returned
      (overwritten) by home Diameter server.

8.  MIPv6 Bootstrapping NAS - HAAA Interface AVPs

   This section defines the AVPs that are specific to Diameter MIPv6
   bootstrapping NAS - HAAA interface and MAY be included in the
   Diameter EAP [RFC4072] and the NASREQ [RFC4005] applications messages
   listed in Section 4 of this document.  The Diameter AVP rules are
   defined in the Diameter Base [RFC3588], Section 4.  These AVP rules
   are observed in AVPs defined in this section.

   The following table describes the Diameter AVPs, their AVP Code
   values, types, possible flag values, and whether the AVP MAY be
   encrypted.  The Diameter base [RFC3588] specifies the AVP Flag rules
   for AVPs in section 4.5.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the integrated scenario are described in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] .  Additionally, the
   security considerations of the Diameter base protocol [RFC3588],
   Diameter NASREQ application [RFC4005] / Diameter EAP [RFC4072]
   application (with respect to network access authentication and the
   transport of keying material) are applicable to this document.

12.  Revision history

   The following changes were made to the -01 version of the draft:

   o  The document title was changed to "The NAS - HAAA Interface for
      MIPv6 Bootstrapping".
   o  Added HAAA and NAS to terminology section".
   o  Changed NAS application to NASREQ application.".
   o  Changed "Integrated Scenario" to NAS-HAAA interface".
   o  The separate Diameter Application-ID for MIPv6 bootstrapping
      (MIP6BSTI) got removed and all bootstrapping is based on Diameter
      EAP application and Diameter NAS application.
   o  MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Feature AVP was removed and General text
      regarding to the capability advertisement based on optional AVPs
      was added.
   o  The capability exchange was modified so that the NAS may suggest a
      specific HA to the AAAH.  Original MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Feature AVP
      was replaces with a possibility to include any bootstrapping AVP
      to the Diameter AAR or DER messages as a capability and local
      allocation hint.

   The following changes were made to the -02 version of the draft:

   o  Section 7 NAS - HAAA Interface AVPs flags were corrected.  'M'
      flag was listed as MUST even if it should have been MUST NOT.
   o  General shortening of the text.
   o  Addition of the MIP6-Home-Address AVP.
   o  Checked against draft-ietf-mip6-radius-01.
   o  Addition of noted & constrains to AVP tables.
   o  Miscellaneous corrections like Mobile IPv6 -> MIPv6.
   o  Added signaling examples for HA assignment from MSP, and local HA
      assignment.
