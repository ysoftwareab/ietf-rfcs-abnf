                   Packet Delay Measurement for SFC 
               draft-agv-sfc-packet-delay-measurement-00


Abstract

   Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the
   capability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet
   Delay.

   The common reasons for packet delay are Nodal processing(Algorithmic,
   Packetization etc...), Queuing, Transmission delay, Propagation delay
   and Service Function processing delay.

   Packet Delay Measurement capability also provides operators with
   greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their
   networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network
   performance evaluation. 

   This document specifies best possible efficient and accurate
   mechanism for passive packet delay measurement for Service Function
   Chains (SFCs) for a SFC network domain.

INTERNET DRAFT      Packet Delay measurement for SFC   December 11, 2015


1 Introduction

   The delivery of end-to-end services often requires various service
   functions.  These include traditional network service functions such
   as firewalls and traditional IP Network Address Translators (NATs),
   as well as application-specific functions. The definition and
   instantiation of an ordered set of service functions and subsequent
   "steering" of traffic through them is termed Service Function
   Chaining (SFC).

   The purpose of this memo is to define a mechanism for packet delay
   measurement for Service Function Chains (SFCs)

   As mentioned in [SFC-PM-arch] packet delay measurement could be
   performed using Active Measurement or Passive Measurement method.
   This document describes the Passive Measurement method & active
   measurement method is out of scope of this document. The passive
   packet delay measurement described in this document is realized by
   adding a new Context Header in the Network Service Header.

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2 Terms & Definition


   Network Service:  An offering provided by an operator that is
           delivered using one or more service functions.  This may
           also be referred to as a "composite service".  The term
           "service" is used to denote a "network service" in the
           context of this document.

           Note: Beyond this document, the term "service" is overloaded
           with varying definitions.  For example, to some a service is
           an offering composed of several elements within the
           operator's network, whereas for others a service, or more
           specifically a network service, is a discrete element such
           as a "firewall". Traditionally, such services (in the latter
           sense) host a set of service functions and have a network
           locator where the service is hosted.

   Classification:  Locally instantiated matching of traffic flows
           against policy for subsequent application of the required
           set of network service functions.  The policy may be
           customer/network/service specific.

   Classifier:  An element that performs Classification.

   Service Function Chain (SFC):  A service function chain defines an
           ordered set of abstract service functions and ordering
           constraints that must be applied to packets and/or frames
           and/or flows selected as a result of classification.
           An example of an abstract service function is "a firewall".
           The implied order may not be a linear progression as the
           architecture allows for SFCs that copy to more than one
           branch, and also allows for cases where there is flexibility
           in the order in which service functions need to be applied.
           The term "service chain" is often used as shorthand for
           service function chain.

   Service Function (SF):  A function that is responsible for specific
           treatment of received packets.  A Service Function can act
           at various layers of a protocol stack (e.g., at the network
           layer or other OSI layers).  As a logical component, a
           service function can be realized as a virtual element or be
 


AGV                      Expires June 13, 2016                  [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT      Packet Delay measurement for SFC   December 11, 2015


           embedded in a physical network element.  One or more Service
           Functions can be embedded in the same network element.
           Multiple occurrences of the service function can exist in
           the same administrative domain.

           One or more service functions can be involved in the
           delivery of added-value services.  A non-exhaustive list of
           abstract service functions includes: firewalls, WAN and
           application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI),
           Lawful Intercept (LI), server load balancing, NAT44
           [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], NPTv6 [RFC6296], HOST_ID
           injection, HTTP Header Enrichment functions, and TCP
           optimizer.

           An SF may be SFC encapsulation aware (that is, it receives
           and acts on information in the SFC encapsulation) or unaware
           (in which case, data forwarded to the SF does not contain
           the SFC encapsulation).  This is often referred to as "SFC
           aware" and "SFC unaware", respectively.

   Service Function Forwarder (SFF):  A service function forwarder
           is responsible for forwarding traffic to one or more
           connected service functions according to information carried
           in the SFC encapsulation, as well as handling traffic coming
           back from the SF.  Additionally, an SFF is responsible for
           delivering traffic to a classifier when needed and supported
           , transporting traffic to another SFF (in the same or
           different type of overlay), and terminating the Service
           Function Path (SFP).

   Metadata:  Provides the ability to exchange context information
           between classifiers and SFs, and among SFs.

   Service Function Path (SFP):  The service function path is a
           constrained specification of where packets assigned to a
           certain service function path must go.  While it may be so
           constrained as to identify the exact locations, it can also
           be less specific.  The SFP provides a level of indirection
           between the fully abstract notion of service chain as a
           sequence of abstract service functions to be delivered, and
           he fully specified notion of exactly which SFF/SFs the
           packet will visit when it actually traverses the network.
           By allowing the control components to specify this level of
           indirection, the operator may control the degree of SFF/SF
           selection authority that is delegated to the network.

   SFC Encapsulation:  The SFC encapsulation provides, at a minimum,
           SFP identification, and is used by the SFC-aware functions,
 


AGV                      Expires June 13, 2016                  [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT      Packet Delay measurement for SFC   December 11, 2015


           such as the SFF and SFC-aware SFs.  The SFC encapsulation is
           not used for network packet forwarding.  In addition to SFP
           identification, the SFC encapsulation carries metadata
           including data-plane context information.

   Rendered Service Path (RSP):  Within an SFP, packets themselves
           are of course transmitted from and to specific places in the
           network, visiting a specific sequence of SFFs and SFs.  This
           sequence of actual visits by a packet to specific SFFs and
           SFs in the network is known as the Rendered Service Path
           (RSP). This definition is included here for use by later
           documents, such as when solutions may need to discuss the
           actual sequence of locations the packets visit.

   SFC-Enabled Domain:  A network or region of a network that
           implements SFC.  An SFC-enabled domain is limited to a
           single network administrative domain.

   SFC Proxy:  Removes and inserts SFC encapsulation on behalf of an
           SFC-unaware service function.  SFC proxies are logical
           elements.

   Network Node/Element:  Device that forwards packets or frames
           based  on outer header information. In most cases is not
           aware of the presence of NSH.

   Network Overlay:  Logical network built on top of existing
           network (the underlay).  Packets are encapsulated or
           tunneled to create the overlay network topology.

   Network Service Header:  Data plane header added to frames/
           packets. The header contains information required for
           service chaining, as well as metadata added and consumed by
           network nodes and service elements.

   NSH Proxy:  Acts as a gateway: removes and inserts SH on behalf
           of a service function that is not NSH aware.

   Service Classifier:  Function that performs classification and
           imposes an NSH.  Creates a service path.  Non-initial (i.e.
           subsequent) classification can occur as needed and can alter,
           or create a new service path.

   Measurement Collector : An operational function that collects 
           measurement data from a Measurement Agent. Measurement 
           collector is responsible for collecting the Performance 
           measurement Data from Measurement Agent. Measurement 
           collector functionality could be integrated with one of

           the MA or with the Controller itself. 

   Measurement Agent: An operational function that contains one or
           more Measurement functions. Measurement Agents is 
           responsible for understand and analyze Performance 
           measurement control information encoded in NSH metadata 
           and perform the performance data collecting and report the 
           same to Measurement collector with key information to 
           identify performance measurement instance along with data
           collected.

   Measurement Controller: An operational function that controls
           running, scheduling, and general coordination of Measurement
           functions by instructing a Measurement Agent using NSH
           metadata. Measurement Controller is responsible for 
           Configuring the Performance measurement Instance. 
           Optionally Performance measurement instance can be 
           configured manually at the Ingress in which case 
           Controller is not required

   Base Header: Provides information about service header and payload 
           protocol

   Service Path Header: Provides Path identification and location 
           within a path
   	
   Context Header: Carries opaque metadata and variable length encoded 
           information

   MD Type: Indicates format of NSH beyond Mandatory Base Header and 
           Service Path Header.

1.3 Applicability and Scope

   This document defines the implementation mechanism for the Packet
   Delay Measurement as per Performance Measurement Architecture [SFC-
   PM-arch]. This document defines a new NSH Message Format for carrying
   Packet Delay Measurement related control information. It also defines
   Operations to be carried out for Packet Loss Measurement.
   Communication mechanism between Measurement Controller, Measurement
   Collector and MA is out of scope of this document.

3 Operations

   For packet delay measurement all the MA's time should be synchronized
   from a centralized stable clock. Among many available time
   synchronization protocols all MAs's must use same protocol and
   synchronize time to the same centralized stable clock. Selection of
   type of time synchronization protocol is for MAs is out of scope of
   this document.

   Every MA needs to maintain the packet delay statistics which they
   immediately report it to collector or may accumulate and report to
   collector at a reporting interval which depends on local policy.

3.1 Delay Measurement Options  

   There are 2 options for packet delay measurement

   Option 1: Delay Measurement is performed using single packet in the
   Measurement Window.

   Option 2: Delay Measurement is performed using multiple packet in a
   measurement window. 

   In case of Option 2 is used for delay measurement, MA sums the
   measured time for the received window and reports the summed time
   together with the count of samples to the Collector. Collector will
   co-relate the time info received across multiple report and compute
   the average time for a window.

3.2 Packet Delay Parameters for Option 1

   Parameters for Option 1:

   1) Rx-Time[P][W]

   2) Tx-Time[P][W]

   These parameters will be created and maintained at every MA

   Rx-Time[P][W]: This 2 dimensional Parameter is maintained at every
   MA. In this P stands for PMF ID and W stands for Window ID. It will
   contain the system time (NTP UTC time format) when packets is
   received for a given PMF ID + Window.

   PMF ID is unique within a SFC Domain, for a given PMF ID there could
   be multiple Windows. This Parameter is created when a Packet Delay PM
   packet is received at a first time within a Reporting  interval. The
   Parameter is deleted upon expiry of Reporting interval at which it

INTERNET DRAFT      Packet Delay measurement for SFC   December 11, 2015


   will be sent to Collector and deleted from MA.

   Tx-Time[P][W]: This 2 dimensional Parameter is maintained at every
   MA. In this P stands for PMF ID and W stands for Window ID. It will
   contain the system time (NTP UTC time format) when packets is sent
   out for a given PMF ID + Window.

   PMF ID is unique within a SFC Domain, for a given PMF ID there could
   be multiple Windows. This Parameter is created when a Packet Delay PM
   packet is sent at a first time within a Reporting interval. The
   Parameter is deleted upon expiry of Reporting interval at which it
   will be sent to Collector and deleted from MA.

3.3 Packet Delay Parameters for Option 2

   Parameter for Option 2:

   1) Rx-Sum-Time[P][W]

   2) Rx-Sample-Count[P][W]

   3) Tx-Sum-Time[P][W]

   4) Tx-Sample-Count[P][W]

   These parameters will be created and maintained at every MA

   Rx-Time[P][W]: This 2 dimensional Parameter is maintained at every
   MA. In this P stands for PMF ID and W stands for Window ID. It will
   contain the sum of system time when packets are received for a given
   PMF ID + Window.

   PMF ID is unique within a SFC Domain, for a given PMF ID there could
   be multiple Windows. This Parameter is created when a Packet Delay PM
   packet is received at a first time within a Reporting interval. The
   Parameter is deleted upon expiry of Reporting interval at which it
   will be sent to Collector and deleted from MA.

   Rx-Sample-Count[P][W]: This 2 dimensional Parameter is maintained at
   every MA. In this P stands for PMF ID and W stands for Window ID. It
   will contain the count of the PM Delay Sample packets received for a
   given PMF ID + Window.

   Tx-Time[P][W]: This 2 dimensional Parameter is maintained at very MA.
   In this P stands for PMF ID and W stands for Window ID. It will
   contain the sum of system time when packets are sent for a given PMF
   ID + Window.

   will contain the count of the PM Delay Sample packets sent for a
   given PMF ID + Window.

3.4 Initiating a Packet Delay Measurement 

   Measurement Controller Programs the PM Instance at the Classifier.
   Within the PM Schedule as programmed in PM Instance, Classifier
   starts the packet classification (based on the classification rule
   programmed in PM Instance). The packet classification policy may be
   customer/network/service specific.


3.5 Encapsulation of Classified Packets

   For the classified packet, PM Context Header is prepared with 
   following information

      - Set the Type Class value to the IANA Allocated PM Class.

      - Set the Type Value to the required Packet Delay Measurement
        type.

      - If Type Value = 0x6
          o Encode the list of Service Index that need to participate
            in Packet Delay Measurement.

      - If Value = 0x7, 0x8, 0x9, 0x10
          o No need to encode SI, since the type dictates the involved
            participating MA 

      - Set the Window Identifier as the current running Window number

      - Encode the 32 bit globally unique PMF ID using the Flow Id 
        Context Header as defined in [I-D quinn-sfc-nsh-tlv].

3.6 Incoming Packets Processing at MA

      On receiving the packet with NSH header following operations are 
      carried out:

      Step 1: Detection of PM Context Header in a packet, by verifying 
              the PM TLV Class as allocated by IANA.
              (If not detected, move to step 6) 

      Step 2: Check if PM Type field value is 6 to 10. 
              (If not move to step 6).

      Step 3: If PM Type Value = 7 to 10 move directly to Step 5

      Step 4: Check Presence of self Service index in Service Index List
              (If not present, move to step 6)

      Step 5: If Option 1 is used then go to Step 5a, if Option 2 is 
              used then go to Step 5b

          Step 5a: Record the value for PMF ID and Window ID; Record 
                   the time when the packet is received Rx-Time[P][W]. 

          Step 5b: Record the value for PMF ID and Window ID; Record 
                   the time when the packet is received and sum it up
                   in Rx-Sum-Time[P][W]. If Rx-Sum-Time[P][W] doesn't
                   exist then create it and initialize it with recorded
                   time value. 

          Also Increment the value of statistics counter 
          Rx-Sample-Count[P][W] by 1. If statistics counter doesn't 
          exist, create it and initialize it with 1.

      Step 6: Packet is sent for Normal Processing

3.7 Outgoing Packets Processing at MA

      At outgoing port of MA following operations are carried out.

      Step 1: If Option 1 is used then go to Step 2a, if Option 2 is 
              used then go to Step 2b

      Step 2: If Option 1 is used then go to Step 2a, if Option 2 is 
              used then go to Step 2b

          Step 2a: Record the value for PMF ID and Window ID; Record
                   the time when the packet is sent Tx-Time[P][W]. 

          Step 2b: Record the value for PMF ID and Window ID; Record 
                   the time when the packet is sent and sum it up in 
                   Tx-Sum-Time[P][W]. If Tx-Sum-Time[P][W] doesn't exist
                   then create it and initialize it with recorded 
                   time value. 

          Also Increment the value of statistics counter 
          Tx-Sample-Count[P][W] by 1. If statistics counter doesn't 
          exist, create it and initialize it with 1.

      Step 3: Packet is sent for Normal Processing

3.8 MA Reporting the statistics to Collector

   Reporting timer will run on Each MA. Consistency of this timer should
   be ensured across the entire MA in the SFP, ensuring the same is out
   of scope of this document. 

   On expiry of this timer following information needs to be sent to the
   Collector.

       - Service Index 

       - PM Type Value

       - Value of all the collected Rx-Time[P][W], Rx-Sum-Time[P][W],
         & Rx-Sample-Count[P][W] parameters along with the 
         corresponding PMF ID and Window Id 

       - Value of all the collected Tx-Time[P][W], Tx-Sum-Time[P][W], 
         & Tx-Sample-Count[P][W] parameters along with the 
         corresponding PMF ID and Window Id 

   MA may delete the parameters after sending the same to collector.

3.9 Packet Delay Calculation at Collector

   Collector accumulates the parameters per PMF per MA per Window.
   Collector computes the Packet Delay    using the accumulated
   parameters per PMF per MA per Window.

3.9.1 Packet Delay Calculation at Collector (Option 1)

   Packet Delay between MA (for example from MA1 to MA2) 
   = (MA2)Rx-Time[P][W] - (MA1)Tx-Time[P][W]

   Packet Delay at MA = (MA)Tx-Time[P][W] - (MA)Rx-Time[P][W]

3.9.1 Packet Delay Calculation at Collector (Option 2)

   On receipt of report from a MA Collector performs following operation

   1) For a PMF if it has Rx-Sum-Time[P][W]/Tx-Sum-Time[P][W] related 
      for an already collected window, received value will be summed up 
      with an existing one, otherwise a new entry is created.

   2) For a PMF if it has Rx-Sample-Count[P][W]/Tx-Sample-Count[P][W] 
      related for an already collected window, received value will be
      summed up with an existing one, otherwise a new entry is created.

   3) Average Time computation by Collector for every MA
      Average-Rx-Time[P][W] = Rx-Sum-Time[P][W]/Rx-Sample-Count[P][W]
      Average-Tx-Time[P][W] = Tx-Sum-Time[P][W]/Tx-Sample-Count[P][W]

   4) Packet Delay between MA (for example from MA1 to MA2)
      = (MA2)Average-Rx-Time[P][W] - (MA1)Average-Tx-Time[P][W]

      Packet Delay at MA 
      = (MA)Average-Tx-Time[P][W] - (MA)Average-Rx-Time[P][W]
