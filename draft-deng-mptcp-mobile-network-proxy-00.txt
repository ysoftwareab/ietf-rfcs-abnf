INTERNET DRAFT     <MPTCP Proxy for Mobile Networks>    February 7, 2014


1  Introduction

   Due the scarcity of wireless frequency resources and the instability
   of wireless signals, combined with the operators' strong motive to
   preserve service upgrade with smooth network evolution, make full use
   of mobile terminal's multi-homing capability has long been a quest
   for mobile networks. 

   In particular, the motivations include resource pooling for better
   performance (where the network could provide a better performance for
   resource-intensive services by allowing them to transparently using
   combined capacities from different RATs) as well as intelligent
   selection for better accommodation and seamless handover for better
   mobility.

   Since R6, 3GPP network defined GAN, interfaces for non-3GPP RATs 
   through GERAN simulation. In R7, I-WLAN was introduced to 3GPP
   network, for inter-working of PLMN with WLAN RAT. In R8, it is
   specified that a shared anchor could be used for both I-WLAN and PS
   RATs, yielding seamless handover. Since R8, there have been work on
   EPS's mobility support for simultaneous multiple RATs through
   different PDN connections (MAPCON). Most recently, in R10, it is
   possible to use EPS's mobility support for simultaneous multiple RATs
   through a single PDN connection (IFOM). 

   However, there is still not possible for a single IP flow to make
   full use of multiple interfaces simultaneously.

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3 Considerations for MPTCP Proxy

   MPTCP[RFC6824] offers transparent wireless resource pooling for a
   single "IP flow" for multi-homing UEs with least network
   complications, as it effectively implements automatic RAT
   selection/handover/pooling through TCP's adaptive end-to-end rating
   mechanism[RFC6356].

   However, end-to-end MPTCP solution deprives network's control over
   service/RAT preference, which is considered to be essential for
   better operation and service provision in 3GPP networks. As the same
   time, it has to suffer from compatibility issues with legacy
   application SPs who are reluctant to support MPTCP natively.

   Therefore, network deployed MPTCP proxy comes as a compromise, which
   would certainly benefit MPTCP-enabled UEs without SP's MPTCP
   deployment by providing protocol adaptation, and at the same time 
   maintain as the wireless network operator's policy enforcement point
   for their preferred network selection/usage strategies.


4 Use-cases for Network deployed MPTCP Proxy

   For 3rd party service provider who does not supporting MPTCP in their
   servers, the network deployed proxy could be used to enable MPTCP
   capability in resource pooling from various radio access networks for
   enhanced QoE/mobility.

   As for 3rd party service providers supporting MPTCP, the network
   deployed proxy could also bring benefits to both the operator and the
   users by enabling the following benefits.

4.1 Dynamic traffic offloading based on network information

   For real-time interactive services with higher QoS requirements it is
   expected that 3GPP network can provide better guarantees on the
   average case. For bulk data transfer who is satisfied with best-
   effort delivery, Wi-Fi would be a great choice. But the vertical
   partition does not fit everywhere for the wireless condition itself
   is quite dynamic and hard to predict. It is important to implement
   adaptive offloading mechanisms in order to achieve higher resource
   utility with ever changing radio environment for a possibly moving
   terminal based on network status, e.g. cell load, AP's signal
   intensity, user's subscription type, etc.

4.2 Resource pooling for reduced expense

   Due to its low construction and operation expenses, Wi-Fi has been
   adopted by mobile operators as a complementary RAT for their
   traditional 3GPP networks. However, different construction and
   operation expenses of various radio networks result in differences in
   charging rates/policies for different RATs. 

   For instance, Wi-Fi access may be charged by the access duration,
   while the 3GPP access may be charged by the consumed data volume.
   Even if using the same policy, Wi-Fi service is expected to be much
   cheaper than 3GPP data service. 

   Moreover, different subscription packages may offer various data
   plans for various RATs. For instance, a basic 4G package may contain
   free data volume as well free Wi-Fi access too.

   By enabling MPTCP session between UE and network proxy, via mediating
   sub-flow data traffic based on their Radio access types and the
   user's subscription package, it is possible to further reduce the
   usage expenses from both sides of the network and user.


5  Requirements for MPTCP Proxy

   In order to realize the above use-cases, it is expected that a
   network deployed MPTCP proxy provide the following functionality:

5.1  Protocol transition

   To allow a MPCTP-enabled UE to make full use of the multiple radio
   interfaces even if it is communicating with a non-MPTCP server, the
   proxy should support 

   (a) Detection of UE's MPTCP capability; 

   (b) Negotiation with MPTCP UE on behalf of non-MPTCP SP; 

   (c) Translation/Mapping between TCP and MPTCP sessions.


5.2  Traffic mediation

   (a) Anchoring of sub-flow traffic: On one hand, it is not always
   possible for a single GW be sitting on the path of every sub-flow
   from a MPTCP session, hence explicit traffic anchoring to enable a
   single point of general control over MPTCP sub-flows should be
   considered.

   (b) Mediation of sub-flow traffic: On the other hand, for fine-
   grained mediation of sub-flow traffic, both static and dynamic
   selection/offloading/pooling policies should be allowed. For
   instance, "always prefer Wi-Fi over 3GPP" could be a static policy
   for bulk data transfer services, while "use 3GPP only for backup
   unless Wi-Fi is congested" could be a dynamic offloading policy for a
   un-prioritized VoIP service.


5  Security Considerations

   TBA.

6  IANA Considerations
