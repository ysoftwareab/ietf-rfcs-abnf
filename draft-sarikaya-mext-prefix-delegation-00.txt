Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support             March 2008


Abstract

   This document defines prefix delegation support for a mobile network.
   Mobile Router dynamically requests its Mobile Network Prefixes from
   its Home Agents using Binding Update.  Home agents get the prefixes
   delegated using DHCP Prefix Delegation and reply to the Mobile Router
   with Binding Acknowledgement.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support             March 2008


1.  Introduction

   Nemo Basic Support Protocol requires that IPv6 prefixes called Home
   Network Prefix(es) delegated to a Mobile Router and advertized in the
   Mobile Network [RFC3963].  However the protocol does not provide any
   means of provisioning MNPs dynamically.

   Prefix delegation is widely discussed in IETF 16NG, MEXT, and NETLMM
   Working Groups.  Corresponding solutions are also introduced.  NEMO
   deals with synchronization of Mobile Network prefixes between a
   Mobile Router and a Home Agent, while the method is agnostic to the
   way that a Home Agent gets prefixes from back end servers.

   [RFC3633] defines Prefix Delegation options and procedures to provide
   a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  A mechanism to manage
   prefixes dynamically by an AAA server can also be defined.

   [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] defines prefix request option for
   the binding update and prefix confirm for the binding acknowledgment
   messages of the Nemo Basic Support Protocol.  Using these messages MR
   can request a prefix from HA with BU and HA can give prefixes to MR
   with BA.  However, how HA gets prefixes is not defined.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3315], [RFC3633]
   and [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation].


3.  Nemo Prefix Delegation Using DHCP

   We assume that the prefixes are managed by an authority that owns the
   Home Network and subnets it into MNPs that it assigns to the MRs.  An
   MNP can be preassigned to the associated MR (e.g. manually or
   automatically with a provisioning system), or assigned dynamically by
   a server such as a DHCP Prefix Delegation server
   [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation].  In this architecture, HA is the
   requesting router and the DHCP Server is the delegating router.  HA
   needs to be collocated with a DHCP Client to solicit/request prefixes
   from the DHCP Server.  HA is configured with the address of the
   delegating router which is a backend DHCP Server.

   The alternative architecture assigns MR to be the requesting router
   and requires the delegating router to be located in HA's subnet.
   Such an architecture is not selected in this document.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support             March 2008


   [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] specifies mechanism for a Mobile
   Router(MR) to synchronize its Mobile Network Prefixes with its Home
   Agents and obtain new ones dynamically.  Figure 1 shows the process
   that a Mobile Router requests prefixes from a Home Agent.


            MR       HA   DHCP Server
            |        |        |
            |------->|        |      1. BU with Prefix Request
            |        |------->|      2. DHCP Solicit
            |        |<-------|      3. DHCP Advertise
            |        |------->|      4. DHCP Request (MNP)
            |        |<-------|      5. DHCP Reply (MNP)
            |<-------|        |      6. BA with Prefix Confirm


                    Figure 1: Prefix Delegation in NEMO

   1.  Mobile Network Prefix request option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] is included in the Binding
       Update(BU) to indicate to the Home Agent(HA) that the MR wishes
       to get new prefixes assigned to it for use as Mobile Networks
       Prefixes.
   2.  DHCP Client at the HA initiates DHCP Solicit procedure to request
       prefixes for the MN.  HA creates and transmits a Solicit message
       as described in sections 17.1.1, "Creation of Solicit Messages"
       and 17.1.2, "Transmission of Solicit Messages" of RFC 3315.  HA
       creates an IA_PD and assigns it an IAID.  HA MUST include the
       IA_PD option in the Solicit message.
   3.  The DHCP server sends an Advertise message to HA in the same way
       as described in section 17.2.2, "Creation and transmission of
       Advertise messages" of RFC 3315.
   4.  HA uses the same message exchanges as described in section 18,
       "DHCP Client-Initiated Configuration Exchange" of RFC 3315 to
       obtain or update prefixes from a DHCP server.  HA and the DHCP
       server use the IA_PD Prefix option to exchange information about
       prefixes in much the same way as IA Address options are used for
       assigned addresses.
   5.  HA stores the prefix information it received in the Reply
       message.
   6.  Mobile Network Prefix Confirm option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] is included in the Binding
       Acknowledgement to allocate the delegated prefixes to the MR.

   Mobile Network Prefix Confirm option carries the prefix lifetime.
   Prefixes can be refreshed either by MR sending a BU or by HA sending
   a BA.

4.  Nemo Prefix Delegation Using AAA

   Diameter prefix delegation application is currently to be defined.
   Once such an application is defined, Nemo prefix delegation using
   this Diameter application will be included in this section.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not by itself introduce any security issues.


6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
