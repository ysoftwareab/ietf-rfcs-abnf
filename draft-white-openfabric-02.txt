Abstract

   Spine and leaf topologies are widely used in hyperscale and cloud
   scale networks.  In most of these networks, configuration is
   automated, but difficult, and topology information is extracted
   through broad based connections.  Policy is often integrated into the
   control plane, as well, making configuration, management, and
   troubleshooting difficult.  Openfabric is an adaptation of an
   existing, widely deployed link state protocol, Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System (IS-IS) that is designed to:

   o  Provide a full view of the topology from a single point in the
      network to simplify operations

   o  Minimize configuration of each router (or switch) in the network

   o  Optimize the operation of IS-IS within a spine and leaf fabric to
      enable scaling

   This document begins with an overview of openfabric, including a
   description of what may be removed from IS-IS to enable scaling.  The
   document then describes an optimized adjacency formation process; an
   optimized flooding scheme; some thoughts on the operation of
   openfabric, metrics, and aggregation; and finally a description of
   the changes to the IS-IS protocol required for openfabric.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Goals

   Spine and leaf fabrics are often used in large scale data centers; in
   this application, they are commonly called a fabric because of their
   regular structure and predictable forwarding and convergence
   properties.  This document describes modifications to the IS-IS
   protocol to enable it to run efficiently on a large scale spine and
   leaf fabric, openfabric.  The goals of this control plane are:

   o  Provide a full view of the topology from a single point in the
      network to simplify operations

   o  Minimize configuration of each router (or switch) in the network

   o  Optimize the operation of IS-IS within a spine and leaf fabric to
      enable scaling

1.2.  Contributors

   The following people have contributed to this draft: Nikos
   Triantafillis (reflected flooding optimization), Ivan Pepelnjak
   (three stage fabric modifications), Hannes Gredler (do not reflood
   optimizations), Les Ginsberg (capabilities encoding, circuit local
   reflooding), Naiming Shen (capabilities encoding, circuit local
   reflooding), Uma Chunduri (failure mode suggestions, flooding), Nick
   Russo, and Rodny Molina.

   See [RFC5449], [RFC5614], and [RFC7182] for similar solutions in the
   Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) solution space.

1.3.  Simplification

   In building any scalable system, it is often best to begin by
   removing what is not needed.  In this spirit, openfabric
   implementations MAY remove the following from IS-IS:

   o  Multilevel flooding domain support.  The modifications described
      in this document will not work across multiple flooding domains.
      It is assumed that multiple fabrics will be connected through an
      Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP), specifically BGP [RFC4271].

   o  All mutliaccess link processing, including Designated Intermediate
      Systems (DIS).  Spine and leaf fabrics are normally built using
      only point-to-point links, so multiaccess link processing is not
      required in openfabric.

Internet-Draft                 Openfabric                     April 2017


   o  External metrics.  There is no need for external metrics in large
      scale spine and leaf fabrics; it is assumed that metrics will be
      properly configured by the operator to account for the correct
      order of route preference at any route redistribution point.

   o  Tags and traffic engineering processing.  Openfabric is only
      designed to provide topology and reachability information.  It is
      not designed to provide for traffic engineering, route preference
      through tags, or other policy mechanisms.  It is assumed that all
      routing policy will be provided through an overlay system which
      communicates directly with each router in the fabric, such as PCEP
      [RFC5440] or I2RS [RFC7921].  Traffic engineering is assumed to be
      provided through Segment Routing (SR)
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].

1.4.  Additions and Requirements

   To create a scalable link state fabric, openfabric includes the
   following:

   o  A slightly modified adjacency formation process.  This is largely
      a matter of forming adjacencies in a specific order, rather than
      forming an adjacency with every discovered neighbor at the same
      time.

   o  A mechanism for determining which tier within a spine and leaf
      fabric in which the router is located.

   o  A mechanism that reduces flooding to the minimum possible, while
      still ensuring complete database synchronization among the routers
      within the fabric.

   o  New sub-TLVs to carry openfabric specific information;
      specifically a new IS reachability tier sub-TLV.

   Openfabric implementations:

   o  MUST support [RFC5301] and enable hostname advertisement by
      default if a hostname is configured on the intermediate system.

   o  MUST support [RFC5311], simplified extension of the link state PDU
      space for IS-IS.

   o  MUST support [RFC5303] and enable three-way handshakes by default.

   o  MUST use TLV type 135 for carrying IPv4 reachability information,
      as defined in [RFC5305].

Internet-Draft                 Openfabric                     April 2017


   o  MUST use TLV type 236 for carrying IPv6 reachability information,
      as defined in [RFC5308].

   o  MUST use TLV type 22 for carrying IS reachability information, as
      defined in [RFC5305].

   o  SHOULD support [RFC6232], purge originator identification for IS-
      IS.

   o  SHOULD support Segment Routing (SR).
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]

   o  SHOULD support [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions].

   o  SHOULD support [RFC3719], section 4, hello padding for IS-IS.
      Variable hello padding SHOULD NOT be used, as data center fabrics
      are built using high speed links on which padded hellos will have
      little performance impact.

   Openfabric implementations MUST NOT be mixed with standard IS-IS
   implementations in operational deployments.  Openfabric and standard
   IS-IS implementations SHOULD be treated as two separate protocols.

1.5.  Sample Network

   The following spine and leaf fabric will be used to describe these
   modifications.

                                 Figure 1

   To reduce confusion (spine and leaf fabrics are difficult to draw in
   plain text art), this diagram does not contain the connections
   between devices.  The reader should assume that each device in a
   given layer is connected to every device in the layer above it.  For
   instance:

   o  5A is connected to 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, and 4F

   o  5B is connected to 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, and 4F

   o  4A is connected to 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, and
      5F

   o  4B is connected to 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, and
      5F

   o  etc.

   The tiers or stages of the fabric are also marked for easier
   reference.  T0 is assumed to be connected to application servers, or
   rather they are Top of Rack (ToR) routers.  The remaining tiers, T1
   and T2, are connected only to the fabric itself.  Note there are no
   "cross links," or "east west" links in the illustrated fabric.  The
   fabric locality detection mechanism described here will not work if
   there are cross links running east/west through the fabric.  Locality

   detection may be possible in such a fabric; this is an area for
   further study.

2.  Modified Adjacency Formation

   While adjacency formation is not considered particularly burdensome
   in IS-IS, it is still useful to reduce the amount of state
   transferred across the network when connecting a new router to the
   fabric.  Any such optimization is bound to present a tradeoff between
   several factors; the mechanism described here increases the amount of
   time required to form adjacencies slightly in order to reduce the
   total state carried across the network.  The process is:

   o  An IS connected to the fabric will send hellos on all links.

   o  The IS will only complete the three-way handshake with one newly
      discovered neighbor; this would normally be the first neighbor
      which sends the newly connected intermediate system's ID back in
      the three-way handshake process.

   o  The IS will complete its database exchange with this one newly
      adjacent neighbor.

   o  Once this process is completed, the IS will continue processing
      the remaining neighbors as normal.

   This process allows each IS newly added to the fabric to exchange a
   full table once; a very minimal amount of information will be
   transferred with the remaining neighbors to reach full
   synchronization.

3.  Determining Location on the Fabric

   The tier to which a router is connected is useful to enable
   autoconfiguration of routers connected to the fabric, and to reduce
   flooding.  This section describes mechanisms for determining the tier
   at which a router is connected in the fabric in several steps.  The
   first step is to find the Farthest Distance (FD) and the Total
   Distance (TD), which are useful in this process.  To find the FD and
   TD:

   o  Calculate a Shortest Path Tree (SPT) for the entire network with
      all link metrics set to 1; this has the effect of calculating a
      tree based only on hop count

   o  Find one node that is the farthest from the local node in the
      resulting tree; call this node F, and the distance to this node FD

Internet-Draft                 Openfabric                     April 2017


   o  Calculate an SPT for the entire network with all link metrics set
      to 1 from the perspective of F; call this TD

3.1.  Determining T0

   If FD == TD == 2, this is a three stage fabric; it is not possible to
   determine the tier at which the local node is located based on any
   calculation, because the topology is perfectly symmetric.  In this
   case:

   o  The T0 routers MAY be manually configured to advertise 0x00 in
      their IS reachability tier sub-TLV, indicating they are at the
      edge of the fabric (a ToR router).

   o  The T0 routers MAY detect that they are T0 through the presence
      connected hosts (i.e. through a request for address assignment or
      some other means).  This means of detection may not be reliable in
      all operational environments, and SHOULD be used with care.  If
      such detection is used, and the router determines it is located at
      T0, it should advertise 0x00 in its IS reachability tier sub-TLV.

   o  The router MAY examine the IS reachability tier sub-TLV of
      directly connected neighbors and determine one or more is
      advertising 0x1 in its IS reachability tier sub-TLVs.  This would
      be the case if the spine routers in a three stage spine and leaf
      fabric are manually configured to advertise their tier as 0x1.

   o  If there is no way to determine whether or not the local device is
      in T0 or T1, it MUST advertise 0xFF in its IS reachability tier
      sub-TLV.

   If FD == TD, and TD >= 4, this is a greater than three stage fabric;
   the local device SHOULD advertise 0x00 in its IS reachability tier
   sub-TLV.

   For instance, in the diagram above, 1A would:

   o  Calculate an SPT with all link metrics set to 1; on this SPT, 5A
      through 5F would all have a distance of 4

   o  Select one of these nodes as F; assume 5F is chosen as F

   o  Set FD to 4, the distance to 5F

   o  Run SPF from the perspective of 5F with all link metrics set to 1

   o  Set TD to 4, the cost from 5F to 1A

Internet-Draft                 Openfabric                     April 2017


   o  TD - FD == 0, so 1A is at T0, and is a ToR

3.2.  Determining T1 and above

   If FD == TD == 2, this is a three stage fabric; it is not possible to
   determine the tier at which the local node is located based on any
   calculation, because the topology is perfectly symmetric.  In this
   case:

   o  The T1 routers MAY be manually configured to advertise 0x01 in
      their IS reachability tier sub-TLV.

   o  The router MAY examine the IS reachability tier sub-TLV of
      directly connected neighbors and determine that one or more is
      advertising 0x00 in its IS reachability tier sub-TLVs.  This would
      be the case if the ToR routers in a three stage spine and leaf
      fabric are manually configured to advertise their tier as 0x00.

   o  If there is no way to determine whether or not the local device is
      in T0 or T1, it should advertise 0xFF in its IS reachability tier
      sub-TLV.

   If TD != FD, this is a greater than three stage fabric; the local
   device SHOULD advertise (TD - FD) in its IS reachability tier sub-
   TLV.

   For example, in the above five stage fabric, 3B would:

   o  Calculate an SPT with all link metrics set to 1; on this SPT, 5A
      through 5F and 1A through 1F would all have a cost of 2

   o  Select one of these nodes as F; assume 5F is chosen as F

   o  Set FD to 2, the distance to 5F

   o  Run SPF from the perspective of 5F with all link metrics set to 1

   o  Set TD to 4, the cost from 5F to 1A

   o  TD - FD == 2, so 1A is at T2, and is a spine switch

4.  Flooding Optimization

   Flooding is perhaps the most challenging scaling issue for a link
   state protocol running on a dense, large scale fabric.  To reduce
   flooding, Openfabric takes advantage of information already available
   in the link state protocol, the list of the local intermediate
   system's neighbor's neighbors, and the fabric locality computed



White & Zandi            Expires October 4, 2017                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                 Openfabric                     April 2017


   above.  The following tables are required to compute a set of
   reflooders:

   o  NL list: The set of neighbors

   o  NN list: The set of neighbor's neighbors; this can be calculated
      by running SPF truncated to two hops

   o  DNR list: The set of neighbors who should have LSPs (or fragments)
      marked Do Not Reflood (DNR)

   o  RF list: The set of neighbors who should flood LSPs (or fragments)
      to their adjacent neighbors to ensure synchronization

   NL is set to contain all neighbors, and sorted deterministically (for
   instance, from the highest router ID to the lowest).  All
   intermediate systems within a single fabric SHOULD use the same
   mechanism for sorting the NL list.  NN is set to contain all
   neighbor's neighbors, or all intermediate systems that are two hops
   away, as determined by performing a truncated SPF.  The DNR and RF
   tables are initially empty.  To begin, the following steps are taken
   to reduce the size of NN and NL:

   o  Move any IS in NL with its tier (or fabric location) set to T0 to
      DNR

   o  Remove all intermediate systems from NL and NN that in the
      shortest path to the IS that originated the LSP

   Then, for every IS in NL:

   o  If the current entry in NL is connected to any entries in NN:

      *  Move the IS to RF

      *  Remove the intermediate systems connected to the IS from NN

   o  Else move the IS to DNR

   When flooding, LSPs transmitted to adjacent neighbors on the RF list
   will be transmitted normally.  Adjacent intermediate systems on this
   list will reflood received LSPs into the next stage of the topology,
   ensuring database synchronization.  LSPs transmitted to adjacent
   neighbors on the DNR list, however, will be transmitted to the DNR
   address (see modifications to the IS-IS protocol, below).

   Any IS receiving a link state packet transmitted to the DNR address
   SHOULD NOT set the Send Route Message (SRM) flag on any interface for

   this LSP; hence the LSP will not be reflooded by this IS to any
   adjacent neighbor.  This reduces flooding to the minimum possible
   while retaining full Link State Database (LSDB) synchronization.

4.1.  Flooding Failures

   It is possible in some failure modes for flooding to be incomplete
   because of the flooding optimizations outlined.  Specifically, if a
   reflooder fails, or is somehow disconnected from all the links across
   which it should be reflooding, it is possible an LSP is only
   partially flooded through the fabric.  To prevent such situations,
   any IS receiving an LSP transmitted using DNR SHOULD:

   o  Set a short timer; the default should be less than one second

   o  When the timer expires, send a Complete Sequence Number Packet
      (CSNP) to all neighbors

   o  Process any Partial Sequence Number Packets (PSNPs) as required to
      resynchronize

   o  If a resynchronization is required, notify the network operator
      through a network management system

5.  Other Optimizations

5.1.  Transit Link Reachability

   In order to reduce the amount of control plane state carried on large
   scale spine and leaf fabrics, openfabric implementations SHOULD NOT
   advertise reachability for transit links.  These links MAY remain
   unnumbered, as IS-IS does not require layer 3 IP addresses to
   operate.  Each router SHOULD be configured with a single loopback
   address, which is assigned an IPv6 address, to provide reachability
   to routers which make up the fabric.

5.2.  Transiting T0 Routers

   In data center fabrics, ToR routers SHOULD NOT be used to transit
   between two T1 (or above) spine routers.  The simplest way to prevent
   this is to set the overload bit [RFC3277] for all the LSPs originated
   from T0 routers.  However, this solution would have the unfortunate
   side effect of causing all reachability beyond any T0 router to have
   the same metric, and many implementations treat a set overload bit as
   a metric of 0xFFFF in calculating the Shortest Path Tree (SPT).  This
   document proposes an alternate solution which preserves the leaf node
   metric, while still avoiding transiting T0 routers.

   Specifically, all T0 routers SHOULD advertise their metric to reach
   any T1 adjacent neighbor with a cost of 0XFFE.  T1 routers, on the
   other hand, will advertise T0 routers with the actual interface cost
   used to reach the T0 router.  Hence, links connecting T0 and T1
   routers will be advertised with an asymmetric cost that discourages
   transiting T0 routers, while leaving reachability to the destinations
   attached to T0 devices the same.

6.  Openfabric and Route Aggregation

   While aggregation is not recommended in openfabric deployments,
   aggregation MAY take place when routing information is being
   transmitted from higher level tiers to lower level tiers.  For
   instance, in the example network, 2A through 2F could advertise a
   single default route to 1A through 1F. 2A through 2F would simply
   advertise the default as if it were an attached to each router
   locally using either a type 135 or 236 TLV, and then block TLVs that
   contain reachability information (such as types 135 and 236).  Type
   22 TLVs, however, MUST be flooded through this boundary, so that
   every router in the network shares a common view of the topology.

   Note that aggregation in a DC fabric can result in routing black
   holes in some cases, and also possibly reduce the efficiency of
   traffic engineering in the network.

7.  Openfabric Modifications to the IS-IS protocol

7.1.  Advertising Tier Level

   The tier level is carried as a subTLV of the router capabilities TLV
   described in [RFC7981].  The subTLV number is TBA; the TLV will
   contain one octet encoding the tier number as an integer.  If the
   openfabric IS only supports IPv6, the procedure described in section
   3 of [RFC7981] MUST be followed, and an IPv6 address carried in the
   IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV according to [RFC5316].

7.2.  Do Not Reflood (DNR)

   Link state packets MUST be encoded in a circuit scope PDU as
   described in [RFC7356]

8.  Security Considerations

   This document outlines modifications to the IS-IS protocol for
   operation on large scale data center fabrics.  While it does add new
   TLVs, and some local processing changes, it does not add any new
   security vulnerabilities to the operation of IS-IS.  However,
   openfabric implementations SHOULD implement IS-IS cryptographic

   authentication, as described in [RFC5304], and should enable other
   security measures in accordance with best common practices for the
   IS-IS protocol.
