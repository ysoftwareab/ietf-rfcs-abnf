          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects     June 1995


          2.  Introduction

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
          describes objects used for managing ATM-based interfaces,
          devices, networks and services in addition to those defined in
          the ATM MIB [1], to provide additional support for the
          management of:
               - ATM Switched Virtual Connections (SVCs)
               - ATM Permanent Virtual Connections (PVCs)


          This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both
          compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the
          peer SNMPv1 definitions.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.


          3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

          The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
          components.  They are:

          0    RFC 1442 [2] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
               for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.

          0    STD 17, RFC 1213 [3] defines MIB-II, the core set of
               managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

          0    RFC 1445 [4] which defines the administrative and other
               architectural aspects of the framework.

          0    RFC 1448 [5] which defines the protocol used for network
               access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Object Definitions

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
          type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively
          assigned name.  The object type together with an object
          instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
          of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
          string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object
          type.


          5.  Overview

          The purpose of this memo is to provide additional
          capabilities, not found in the ATM MIB [1], which are needed
          to manage ATM interfaces.  This memo addresses the following
          areas:
               - ATM Switch/Network/Host Support
               - ATM Switch/Network Support
               - ATM Host Support



          5.1.  Background

          In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB
          modules are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and
          cross-connects.  Examples include MIB II for general system
          and interface management (RFC 1213 and RFC 1573), the DS3 or
          SONET MIBs for management of SONET and DS3 physical
          interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for applications
          that make use of ATM, such as SMDS [15] and LAN Emulation
          [14].  These MIB modules are outside the scope of this
          specification.

          This MIB module also requires the use of the ATM MIB module
          defined in [1].

          ATM Endpoint applications such as ATM LAN Emulation or
          Classical IP-over-ATM Clients and Servers use ATM to establish
          SVC/PVC connections for exchanging control and data
          information. The agents of these ATM applications must provide

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects     June 1995


          the network manager with information on the SVC/PVCs in use
          and which applications are using them.  The information can be
          made generic so as to apply to all ATM applications.  This
          memo proposes extensions to the ATM MIB [1] in order to
          support this.

          The current specification of this supplemental ATM MIB is
          based on SNMPv2.

          5.2.  Supported Functions

          The managed ATM objects are arranged into the following
          groups:

          I. ATM Switch/Network/Host Support:
                (1) ATM Switch/Network/Host Group
                      atmVclStatTable
                      atmVplStatTable                                     +
                (2) ATM Switch/Network/Host SVC Group
                      atmSvcTable (partially)
          II. ATM Switch/Network Support:
                (3) ATM Switch/Network Group
                      atmIfAdminAddrTable
                (4) ATM Switch/Network SVC Group
                      atmSvcTable (partially)
          III. ATM Host Support:
                (5) ATM Host Group
                      atmVclExtTable
                      atmVclAddressTable                                  |
                      atmAddrVclTable                                     |
                (6) ATM Host Signalling Group                             |
                      atmSigDescrParamTable
          IV. Signalling-over-VPC Support:                                |
                (7) ATM VP Interface Configuration Group
                      atmVplIfConfTable


          5.2.1.  ATM Switch/Network/Host Support

          5.2.1.1.  ATM Switch/Network/Host Group

          5.2.1.1.1.  ATM VCL Statistics Table

          The atmVclStatTable contains counters such as the cells         |
          received and cells transmitted per VCL (SVC or PVC). These      |

          draft        Supplemental ATM Management Objects     June 1995


          counters are defined as 32 bit integers.  The implementation    |
          of this table is optional.

          5.2.1.1.2.  ATM VPL Statistics Table

          The atmVplStatTable contains counters such as the cells         +
          received and cells transmitted per VPL (SVC or PVC). These      +
          counters are defined as 32 bit integers.  The implementation    +
          of this table is optional.                                      +

          5.2.1.2.  ATM Switch/Network/Host SVC Group

          All objects in this Group are listed in the atmSvcTable. This
          table also contains objects of the ATM Switch/Network SVC
          Group.

          5.2.1.2.1.  ATM Interface SVC Configuration

          This group contains information on the configuration of local   |
          ATM interfaces on an ATM device required to support SVCs in     |
          addition to those defined in the atmInterfaceConfTable of the   |
          ATM MIB [1] and those defined in RFC1573 [6].  This group       |
          includes the signalling entity role and the signalling type.    |
          The signalling entity role object defines whether a signalling  |
          entity has the role of user, network, or a symmetric entity.    |

          The signalling type defines the type of signalling supported    |
          at the local ATM interface (e.g., ITU-T DSS2 signalling).  The  |
          defined signalling types supported by this MIB include: ITU-T   |
          DSS2 [11], ATM Forum's UNI 3.1 [10], and ATM Forum's P-NNI      |
          [12].                                                           |

          5.2.1.2.2.  SSCOP                                               -

          This group contains information on the ATM SSCOP signalling
          layer and must be supported by signalling entities.

          5.2.1.2.3.  Unsupported Service Failures

          This group contains information on the setup failures that
          occur when setting up an ATM SVC.  Maintaining counters for
          each individual signalling cause codes would result in a large
          number of counters.  Instead, this memo uses an approach that
          lumps events into three categories.  Three counters are used
          to monitor connection failures occurring due to: 1)

          unavailable route, 2)  unavailable switch or network
          resources, or 3) the called party.  The counters are defined
          as follows:

                  1. Route Unavailable Counter

                     This counter maintains the number of
                     calls cleared because there was no
                     route unavailable to the destination.

                  2. Resources Unavailable Counter

                     This counter maintains the number of cleared
                     calls due to switch or network resources being
                     unavailable.

                  3. Called Party Counter

                     This counter maintains the number of cleared
                     calls caused by the called party (e.g.,
                     called party rejects the call).


          5.2.1.2.4.  ATM Signalling Layer Protocol Errors

          This group contains information on the Protocol Errors that
          occur at the signalling layer when establishing an ATM SVC.

          5.2.1.2.5.  UNI Signalling Sub-layer Statistics

          Configuration information is needed per signalling entity in    |
          order to manage attributes of all SVCs set up by that entity.   |
          Since signalling entities are not always bound one to one to    |
          ATM UNIs, a more flexible indexing mechanism would be to allow  |
          multiple signalling entities on a single UNI or vice versa -    |
          using ifIndex and VPI would provide sufficient flexibility      |
          here.                                                           |

          Statistics per VCL are needed in order to find out the usage
          of VCL resources by ATM applications.  Additionally, to         |
          monitor the usage and health of a UNI signalling                |
          entity, some counters are needed per UNI signalling entity.     |
          Two new objects are added to count the number of connections    |
          established.  One for incoming SVCs and one for outgoing SVCs.  |

          This group is only supported by switches or networks for        |
          interfaces that have multiple associated addresses.  This       |
          group contains an ATM Interface Administrative Address Table    |
          (atmIfAdminAddrTable) which lists valid addresses for calls to  |
          and from a given interface.  One of these numbers shall be      |
          specified as the "default" number.                              |

          A number of Information Elements may or may not be supported    |
          by ATM switches or Networks. Hence, for trouble isolation it    |
          is important to keep track which particular Information         |
          Elements are supported.  The corresponding group of objects     |
          must be supported by switches or networks supporting SVCs, and  |
          indicate whether the following Information Elements are         |
          enabled/disabled:                                               |

          5.2.3.1.1.  VCL Extension Table

          There can be two types of VCLs used by ATM applications: a      |
          Permanent VC or a Switched VC.  The ATM MIB [1] provides        |
          general connection management (atmVclTable).  This memo         |
          contains the atmVclExtTable, an extension to the atmVclTable,   |
          which supports both SVC/PVC monitoring and SVC configuration    |
          capabilities.                                                   |

          The object Connection Type specifies the type of the VCL as     |
          either a PVC, an incoming SVC, or an outgoing SVC.              |
          When creating an SVC, the agent can represent the VCL's
          attributes by selecting entries from two tables: the ATM
          Traffic Descriptor Parameter Table defined in the ATM MIB [1]
          and the ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table defined in    |
          this memo.  For SVCs, the ATM VCL Signalling Descriptor Index   |
          object is used to point to an entry in the ATM Signalling       |
          Descriptor Parameter Table.                                     |

          5.2.3.1.2.  ATM VPI/VCI to Address Mapping Table

          In the atmVclAddressTable, the objects ATM Local Address        |
          (atmLocalAddr) and ATM Remote Address (atmRemoteAddr)           |
          represent the two endpoint addresses of a VCL.  ATM Local       |
          Address identifies the local endpoint of the VCL represented    |
          by this agent.  While, the ATM Remote address represents the    |
          address of the ATM application at the other end of the VCL.     |
          The atmLocalAddrIndex allows an agent to uniquely identify a    |
          single entry under a given Local ATM Address, esp. when there   |
          are multiple VCLs.  The atmRemoteAddrIndex is used in a         |
          similar manner.                                                 |

          5.2.3.1.3.  ATM Address to VPI/VCI Mapping Table

          Some ATM applications (e.g. LAN Emulation) use ATM endpoint
          addresses even over PVCs.  In order to trace SVC/PVCs between
          such ATM applications, it is important to be able to monitor
          VCLs (both SVCs and PVCs) indexed by their endpoint ATM         |
          addresses.  The atmAddrVclTable contains all VCCs currently     |
          active and is indexed by the remote ATM address. It is the      |
          reverse of the atmVclAddressTable.                              |

          5.2.3.2.  ATM Host SVC Group

          5.2.3.2.1.  Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table

          This table extends the ATM VCL table of the ATM MIB [1] to
          include all other necessary signalling information as
          specified in both ATM Forum UNI Specifications [9] and [10].
          A user can create an entry with all signalling parameters and
          later use that entry to specify the signalling characteristics
          of SVCs.

          Signalling attributes can be grouped into following
          categories:

          1)   ATM Adaptation Layer Parameters

          Information in this group are captured in the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.5 of [9] and [10].

          2)   Broadband Bearer Capability

          Information in this group are captured by the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.7 of [9] and [10].

          3)   Broadband High Layer Information

          Information in this group are captured by the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.8 of [9] and [10].

          4)   Broadband Low Layer Information

          Information in this group are captured by the ATM Signalling
          Descriptor Parameter Table defined in this memo.  Please refer
          to section 5.4.5.9 of [9] and [10].

          5.2.4.  Signalling-over-VPC Support

          5.2.4.1.  ATM VP Interface Configuration

          -- Text to be provided --


          6.  Valid Address Sets / Default Address

          A given ATM UNI interface may have an Address,
          "ifPhysAddress", to identify the interface.  In addition, a
          given ATM UNI  interface may have several other valid
          addresses which can be used to originate and receive calls.
          The valid addresses that are used to receive calls are listed
          in the "ifRcvAddrTable" defined in RFC1573 [6].  ATM
          interfaces of switches and networks do not use the
          ifRcvAddrTable.  Valid addresses to be used by a switch or
          network are listed in the ATM Interface Administrative Address
          Table.  The ATM Interface Administrative Address Table is not
          supported by hosts.


          7.  Configuration of VPLs, VCLs, and Cross-Connects

          The ATM Managed Objects needed to support the configuration of
          VPLs, VCLs, and Cross-Connects are defined in the ATM MIB [1].
