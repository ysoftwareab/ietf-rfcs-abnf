r= Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  MUST be a
      local-part (see Section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) specifying an e-mail
      address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail claiming to be
      from this domain (see Section 2.4 of [SPF] for a description of
      how domains are identified for SPF checks) has failed the
      evaluation algorithm described in [SPF], in particular because a
      message arrived via an unauthorized route.  The format of this
      reply MUST be in the format specified by the "rf=" tag defined
      below.  To generate a complete address to which the report is
      sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the SPF domain per paragraph 4.1 of [SPF]. r= modifiers in a
      record that was reached by following an include: mechanism MUST be
      ignored.

      ABNF:

spf-report-tag = %x72 "=" qp-section

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is a single integer value from 0 to 100
      inclusive that indicates what percentage of incidents of signature
      authentication failures, selected at random, should cause reports
      to be generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports
      for more than the requested percentage of incidents.  Report
      generators MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to
      indicate that there are more reportable incidents than there are
      reports.

      ABNF:

spf-rp-tag = %x72 %x69 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*12DIGIT "/" 1*12DIGIT
ro=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 4.1 for a
      list of valid tags.

      ABNF:

spf-ro-type = ( "all" / "e" / "f" / "s" / "n" )

spf-ro-tag = %x72 %x6f "=" spf-ro-type 0* ( ":" spf-ro-type )
