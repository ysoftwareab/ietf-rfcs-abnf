Abstract

   This document, proposes a binding from the abstract iCalendar
   Transport-independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) using Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) as transport and SIP/SIPS URIs as
   addresses. This document proposes using the iTIP objects as a MIME
   payload format with SIP. iTIP is an abstract transport protocol for
   exchanging calendaring information between calendar systems using the
   iCalendar, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
   Specification defined by RFC 2445. SIP is a application-layer
   signaling protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating
   multimedia sessions, retrieving user presence and sending instant
   messages.

1 Introduction and Motivation

   This binding document provides the transport specific information
   necessary to convey iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol (iTIP) over SIP as a MIME payload as defined in [SIP] and
   [RFC-2045].

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                      October 2002

   The goal of this document is to extend the iCalendar framework so
   that it can be used to describe Internet multimedia conferences and
   chat rooms. The iCalendar provides means to provide descriptions,
   identify participants, their roles and other resources for meetings
   taking place on the Internet as well as in the real world. The XML
   iCalendar information can easily be transmitted over SIP instant
   messages [SIP-IM] just as Internet e-mail is used today. However,
   when SIP addresses are used to identify the attendees and other
   meeting resources, the addresses can directly be used to contact
   participants in and to establish conferences in real time.

   Other applications may also include availability and timezone
   information. For example, if callee's SIP telephone returns his
   freebusy and timezone information, the caller's SIP user-agent can
   automatically determine suitable time to retry the call. This kind of
   information can also be included in the SIP event documents.

   The mapping from iTIP methods and SIP message types is simple. Any
   iTIP method can be sent within the message body of SIP MESSAGE
   request. However, a iTIP PUBLISH method can be sent within the
   message body of any SIP message that can be delivered from UA to UA.
   In other words, CANCEL requests and responses to them as well as
   hop-by-hop ACK requests may not include a iCalendar object.

   In some use cases [CPIM] instant messaging (IM) URIs and [RFC-2806]
   telephone (TEL) URIs can be used as calendar user addresses in
   addition to the SIP URIs.

1.1 Related Documents

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that
   form the existing framework for Internet calendaring and scheduling
   standards.

   This document, [iSIP], proposes a SIP binding for iTIP;

   [iCAL] - specifies a core specification of objects, data types,
            properties and property parameters;

   [iTIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling
            between different implementations;

   [iMIP] - specifies an Internet email binding for iTIP;

   [SIP] - specifies SIP, Session Initiation Protocol; and

   [SIP-IM] - specifies an extension to SIP for delivering instant
              messages.

   This document does not attempt to repeat the specification of
   concepts or definitions from these other documents. Where possible,
   references are made to the document that provides for the

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                        March 2003

   specification of the concepts or definitions.

1.2 Terminology

   The SIP-related terms used in this document are defined in [SIP,
   SIP-IM]. The MIME-related terms used in this document are defined in
   [RFC2045]. The calendaring and scheduling terms used in this document
   are defined in [iCAL] and [iTIP].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

2 SIP Message Format Binding

   This section defines the iCalendar message binding to the SIP message
   bodies. SIP messages can carry their content in the form of MIME body
   parts.

   The sections below refer to the "originator" and the "recipient" of
   an iSIP message. Typically, the originator is the "Organizer" of an
   event. The respondent is an "Attendee" of the event.

   The [SIP] "From", "To", "Contact", "Reply-To" or [SIP-PRIV]
   "Remote-Party-ID" headers typically contains the SIP address of the
   originator or respondent of an event. However, this cannot be
   guaranteed as SIP user-agents are not required to enforce iTIP
   semantics.

2.1 SIP Requests and Responses

   The vCalendar requests are typically included in SIP MESSAGE
   requests. A response to a vCalendar request is not usually included
   in the SIP response message, but a separate SIP MESSAGE is used for
   sending the response.

   Other SIP requests and responses MAY be used to PUBLISH iCalendar
   components.

2.2 Security

   This section addresses several aspects of security including
   Authentication, Authorization and Confidentiality. Authentication and
   confidentiality is achieved using normal SIP means, e.g., using
   S/MIME [RFC-1847, RFC-2630, RFC-2633].

2.2.1 Authorization

   In [iTIP] messages, only the "Organizer" is authorized to modify or
   cancel calendar entries they organize. That is, sip:spoof@xyz.com is
   not allowed to modify or cancel a meeting that was organized by
   im:a@example.com. Furthermore, only the respondent has the

Pessi & Mela           Expires September 1, 2003                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                        March 2003

   authorization to indicate their status to the "Organizer". That is,
   the "Organizer" must ignore an [iTIP] message from sip:spoof@xyz.com
   that declines a meeting invitation for im:b@example.com.

   Implementations of iSIP SHOULD verify the authenticity of the creator
   of an iCalendar object before taking any action. The methods for
   doing this are presented later in this document.

   Message flow in iTIP supports someone working on behalf of a
   "Calendar User" through use of the "sent-by" attribute that is
   associated with the "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" elements. However,
   there is no mechanism to verify whether or not a "Calendar User" has
   authorized someone to work on their behalf. It is left to
   implementations to provide mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to
   make that decision.

2.2.2 Authentication

   Authentication can be performed using an implementation of [RFC-1847]
   "multipart/signed" that supports public/private key certificates.
   Authentication is possible only on messages that have been signed.
   Authenticating an unsigned message may not be reliable.

2.2.3 Confidentiality

   To ensure confidentiality using iSIP implementations should utilize
   S/MIME-compliant encryption. The protocol does not restrict a
   "Calendar User Agent" (CUA) from forwarding iCalendar objects to
   other users or agents.

2.3 Attendee Addresses

   The calendar address specified within the "attendee" element in an
   iCalendar object SHOULD be a valid SIP URI [RFC3261] address for the
   corresponding "Organizer" or "Attendee" element of the "vevent",
   "vtodo", or "vfreebusy" elements.

       OPEN ISSUE: In which circumstances [tel] telephone tel: or (CPIM)
                   instant messaging (im:) URLs can be used?

   Because [iTIP] does not preclude "attendees" from forwarding
   "vevents" or "vtodos" to others, the apparent originator address may
   not equal that of the "Organizer". Additionally, the "Organizer" or
   "Attendee" cannot be reliably inferred by the [SIP] "From",
   "Contact", "Remote-Party-ID" or "Reply-to" values of an iSIP message.

   The relevant address MUST be ascertained by opening the
   "text/calendar" MIME body part and examining the "ATTENDEE" and
   "ORGANIZER" properties.

2.4 Content Type

   A MIME body part containing content information that conforms to this
   document MUST have an "Content-Type" header field of
   "text/calendar". The "Content-Type" header field SHOULD
   also include the type parameters "method" and "component". The
   "method" contains a single iTIP method name which MUST correspond to
   the value of the "METHOD" attribute of the vCalendar elements within
   the iCalendar object. The "component" parameter is also a quoted,
   comma-separated list and it defines the iCalendar component types
   contained within the iCalendar object.

   The following is an example of this header field with a value that
   indicates an event message.

        Content-Type: text/calendar;method="REQUEST"
           ;component="VEVENT,VTODO"

   The "text/calendar" content type allows for the scheduling message
   type to be included as a MIME multipart message body with other
   content information (i.e., "multipart/mixed") or included in a MIME
   message with a clear-text, human-readable form of the scheduling
   message (i.e., "multipart/alternative"). This can be done in order to
   permit the information in the scheduling message to be understood by
   SIP user agents (UA) that do not support the "text/calendar" content
   type.

2.5 Content-Transfer-Encoding

   Note that the default character set for XML iCalendar objects is
   UTF-8. As SIP protocol can handle binary message bodies, transfer
   encoding MUST NOT be used for iCalendar objects. Gateways from
   MIME-compliant protocols to SIP MUST remove any Content-Transfer-
   Encoding prior to delivering the iCalendar object to SIP.
           
2.6 Content-Disposition

   The SIP User-Agents determine how to interpret a message body part
   based on the Content-Disposition header field. The default
   "disposition-type" for SIP is "render", indicating that the body part
   should be displayed or otherwise rendered to the user.

      OPEN ISSUE: Does calendar objects warrant a disposition-type of
      their own, for example, if the calendar object should be handled
      by calendar application without any user intervention?

3 Security Considerations

   The security threats that applications must address when implementing
   iTIP are detailed in [iTIP]. Two spoofing threats are identified:
   Spoofing the "Organizer", and Spoofing an "Attendee". To address
   these threats, the originator of an iCalendar object must be

Pessi & Mela           Expires September 1, 2003                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                        March 2003

   authenticated by a recipient. Once authenticated, a determination can
   be made as to whether or not the originator is authorized to perform
   the requested operation. Compliant applications MUST support signing
   and encrypting text/calendar attachments using a mechanism
   based on S/MIME [RFC-2633, RFC-1847] to facilitate the authentication
   the originator of the iCalendar object. Implementations MAY provide a
   means for users to disable signing and encrypting. The steps are
   described below:

   1. The iCalendar object MUST be signed by the "Organizer" when
   sending an update or the "Attendee" when sending a reply.

   2. Using the S/MIME, determine who signed the iCalendar object. This
   is the "signer". Note that the signer is not necessarily the person
   that sent the SIP message.

   3. Correlate the signer to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar
   object. If the signer cannot be correlated to an "ATTENDEE" property,
   ignore the message.

   4. Determine whether or not the "ATTENDEE" is authorized to perform
   the operation as defined by [iTIP]. If the conditions are not met,
   ignore the message.

   5. If all the above conditions are met, the message can be processed.

   To address the confidentiality security threats, signed iSIP messages
   SHOULD be encrypted by a mechanisms based on S/MIME [RFC-1847,
   RFC-2633].

   It is possible to receive iSIP messages sent by someone working on
   behalf of another "Calendar User". This is determined by examining
   the "sent-by" parameter in the relevant "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE"
   property.  [iCAL] and [iTIP] provide no mechanism to verify that a

   "Calendar User" has authorized someone else to work on their behalf.
   To address this security issue, implementations MUST provide
   mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to make that decision before
   applying changes from someone working on behalf of a "Calendar User".

4.2 Using Multipart Alternative for Low Fidelity Clients

   This example shows how a client can emit a multipart message that
   includes both a plain text version as well as the full iCalendar
   object. Clients that do not support "text/calendar" will still be
   capable of rendering the plain text representation.

5 Recommended Practices

   This section outlines a series of recommended practices when using a
   SIP to exchange iCalendar objects.

5.1 Use of Content and Message IDs

   The [iCAL] specification makes frequent use of the URI for data types
   in properties such as "DESCRIPTION", "ATTACH", "CONTACT" and others.
   Two forms of URIs are Message ID (MID) and Content ID (CID). These
   are defined in [RFC-2111]. Although [RFC-2111] allows referencing
   messages or MIME body parts in other MIME entities or stores, it is
   strongly recommended that iSIP implementations include all referenced
   messages and body parts in a single MIME entity. Simply put, if an
   iCalendar object contains CID or MID references to other messages or
   body parts, implementations should ensure that these messages and/or
   body parts are transmitted with the iCalendar object. If they are not
   there is no guarantee that the receiving "CU" will have the access or
   the authorization to view those objects.
