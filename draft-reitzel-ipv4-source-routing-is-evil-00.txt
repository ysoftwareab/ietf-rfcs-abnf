Abstract

   [RFC0791] defines two IPv4 options called "Strict Source Routing" and
   "Loose Source Routing".  Functionality provided by these options can
   be exploited in order to perform remote network discovery, to bypass
   firewalls and to achieve packet amplification for the purposes of
   generating denial-of-service traffic.  This document updates RFC 791
   to deprecate the use of the IPv4 Strict Source Routing Option as well
   as the IPv4 Loose Source Routing Option.

1.   Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   [RFC0791] defines two IPv4 options called "Strict Source Routing" and
   "Loose Source Routing".  Functionality provided by these options can
   be exploited in order to perform remote network discovery, to bypass
   firewalls and to achieve packet amplification for the purposes of
   generating denial-of-service traffic.  This document updates RFC 791
   to deprecate the use of the IPv4 Strict Source Routing Option as well
   as the IPv4 Loose Source Routing Option.


3.  Implementation

   Compliant IPv4 hosts and routers MUST NOT transmit IPv4 datagrams
   containing either the Strict Source Routing Option or the Loose
   Source Routing Option.


4.  Operations

   Compliant IPv4 hosts and routers that receive IPv4 datagrams
   containing either the Strict Source Routing or Loose Source Routing
   Options MUST silently discard those datagrams without further
   processing.


5.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to deprecate an IPv4 feature which
   has been shown to have serious security implications.  These security
   implications have been well understood in the operator community for
   many years.  For this reason, Internet Service Providers typically
   block all incoming IPv4 datagrams that include either the Strict
   Source Routing or Loose Source Routing Options.

   Recently, researchers [BiondiEbalard] have demonstrated security
   vulnerabilites associated with the IPv6 Route Header Type 0
   Extension.  Because of its similar function, vulnerabilities
   associated with the IPv6 Route Header Type 0 Extension can be
   generalized to affect the above mentioned IPv4 options.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA update the description of IPv4
   Strict Source Routing and Loose Source Routing Options to indicate
   that the use of these options is deprecated.


7.  Acknowlegements

   This document follows in the spirit of [I-D.jabley-ipv6-rh0-is-evil],
   which proposes the deprecation of the IPv6 Route Header Type 0
   Extension.

   A description of security vulnerabilities associated with the the
   IPv6 Route Header Type 0 Extension was presented by Philippe Biondi
   and Arnaud Ebalard at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver, 2007
   [BiondiEbalard].
