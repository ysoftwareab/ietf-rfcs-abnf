Internet-Draft         Atom Link Relation: Discuss              May 2008


1.  Introduction

   Atom [ATOM] is an XML-based document format that describes lists of
   related information known as "feeds".  Feeds are composed of a number
   of items, known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached
   metadata.  Such metadata can include links to other resources, which
   are primarily defined by Uniform Resource Indentifiers [URI] or
   Internationalized Resource Indentifiers [IRI].  A link can be
   secondarily defined as partaking in a specific kind of relationship
   to the document.  This specification defines a new link relation,
   "discuss", which can be used to point to Internet resources where a
   person can actively engage in a multi-party discussion or
   conversation about the document itself or the primary topic covered
   by the document.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [TERMS].

   This specification allows the use of Internationalized Resource
   Identifiers [IRI].  Every Uniform Resource Identifier [URI] is also
   an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is named.  When an IRI
   that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped
   to a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of [URI].  When an IRI is
   serving as an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.


3.  The 'discuss' Link Relation

   An Atom link element with a rel attribute value of "discuss" is used
   to reference an Internet resource where multi-party discussion of the
   feed, entry, or source can occur.  In the terminology of this
   specification, such a resource is called a "venue".  Such venues
   might include, but are not limited to, the following:

   o  Electronic mail discussion lists
   o  Network news discussion boards (see [NNTP])
   o  Internet Relay Chat channels (see [IRC])
   o  Web-based forums accessible via the Hypertext Transport Protocol
      (see [HTTP])
   o  Multi-user chat rooms based on the Extensible Messaging and
      Presence Protocol (see [MUC] and [XMPP])
   o  Multi-user chat rooms based on the Message Session Relay Protocol
      (see [MSRP])

Internet-Draft         Atom Link Relation: Discuss              May 2008


   o  Voice or video conference rooms based on the Session Initiation
      Protocol (see [SIP])

   The use of the "discuss" relation enables a person who receives an
   Atom feed or entry to discover a venue where the person can engage in
   a conversation about the feed or entry with interested others.  This
   use case is not currently addressed by any existing Atom link
   relation, which to date address use cases such as reading background
   material (the "related" relation) or following other people's
   comments (the "comments" relation) rather than actively engaging in a
   conversation or discussion about the feed or entry.

   It is expected that a link relation of type "discuss" would be
   presented to a human user in such a way that the user would
   understand that following the link would result in joining an active
   discussion venue rather than accessing a static resource.

   If the rel attribute has a value of "discuss" but the type attribute
   of the atom:link is omitted, no type value shall be assumed.

   Although Atom feed, entry, and source elements MAY each contain any
   number of atom:link elements using the "discuss" link relation, this
   specification assigns no significance to the presence or order of
   such links.  Multiple discuss links appearing within an atom:entry
   may reference alternative representations of the same venue or may
   reference entirely distinct venues containing distinct conversations.
   Processors MUST NOT assume that multiple discuss links make reference
   to different representations of the same venue and MUST process each
   discuss link independently of any others.


4.  Example

   The following example shows an Atom entry that contains numerous
   links related to the ejabberd XMPP server project, including links to
   an XMPP chatroom, an email discussion list, a web forum, and two web
   pages with background information.

   Notice that the entry contains three links of type "relation" (which
   can be differentiated via the URI scheme, i.e., "xmpp" vs. "mailto"
   vs. http") and three links to HTTP resources (which can be
   differentiated via the relation type, i.e., "discuss" vs. "related").


5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces few additional security considerations
   beyond those associated with the use and resolution of URIs/IRIs in

   general.

   However, depending on the technology used and the local service
   policy at a particular installation, a venue for multi-party
   discussion may expose personally-identifying information about the
   participants (e.g., IP addresses), may be public in the sense that
   anyone can join the venue, and may archive the conversations that
   occur in the venue either privately or publicly (e.g., on the World
   Wide Web).  An Atom user agent or the appropriate helper application
   should warn a human user about the possibility of information
   exposure and public archiving.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type, which
   shall be registered in the IANA Registry of Atom Link Relations, as
   defined by [ATOM].

   Attribute value:  discuss
   Description:  (see Section 3)
   Expected display characteristics:  (see Section 3)
   Security considerations:  (see Section 5)
