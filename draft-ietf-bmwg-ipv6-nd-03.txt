1.  Introduction

   When an IPv6 node forwards a packet, it executes the following
   procedure:

   o  Identify the IPv6 next-hop (i.e., the next IPv6 node that the
      packet traverses on route to its ultimate destination)

   o  Query a local Neighbor Cache (NC) to determine the IPv6 next-hop's
      link-layer address

Internet-Draft              NDP Benchmarking              September 2016


   o  Encapsulate the packet in a link-layer header.  The link-layer
      header includes the IPv6 next-hop's link-layer address

   o  Forward the packet to the IPv6 next-hop

   IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861] to
   maintain the NC.  Operational experience [RFC6583] shows that when an
   implementation cannot maintain a sufficiently complete NC, its
   ability to forward packets is impaired.

   NDP, like any other protocol, consumes processing, memory, and
   bandwidth resources.  Its ability to maintain a sufficiently complete
   NC depends upon the availability of the above-mentioned resources.

   This document provides benchmarking procedures for NDP.  Benchmarking
   procedures include a Baseline Test and an NDP Scaling Test.  In both
   tests, the Device Under Test (DUT) is an IPv6 router.  Two physical
   links (A and B) connect the DUT to a Tester.  The Tester sends
   traffic through Link A to the DUT.  The DUT forwards that traffic,
   through Link B, back to the Tester.

   The above-mentioned traffic stream contains one or more interleaved
   flows.  An IPv6 Destination Address uniquely identifies each flow.
   Or, said another way, every packet within a flow has the same IPv6
   Destination Address.

   In the Baseline Test, the traffic stream contains exactly one flow.
   Because every packet in the stream has the same IPv6 Destination
   Address, the DUT can forward the entire stream using exactly one NC
   entry.  NDP is exercised minimally and no packet loss should be
   observed.

   The NDP Scaling Test is identical to the Baseline Test, except that
   the traffic stream contains many flows.  In order to forward the
   stream without loss, the DUT must maintain one NC entry for each
   flow.  If the DUT cannot maintain one NC entry for each flow, packet
   loss will be observed and attributed to NDP scaling limitations.

   This document proposes an NDP scaling metric, called NDP-MAX-
   NEIGHBORS.  NDP-MAX-NEIGHBORS is the maximum number of neighbors to
   which an IPv6 node can send traffic during periods of high NDP
   activity.

   The procedures described herein reveal how many IPv6 neighbors an NDP
   implementation can discover.  They also provide a rough estimate of
   the time required to discover those neighbors.  However, that
   estimate does not reflect the maximum rate at which the

Internet-Draft              NDP Benchmarking              September 2016


   implementation can discover neighbors.  Maximum rate discovery is a
   topic for further exploration.

   The test procedures described herein assume that on the DUT, NDP does
   not compete for resources with other applications.  When NDP
   completes for resources, its scaling characteristics may not be
   commensurate with those reported by the benchmarks described herein.

                           Figure 1: Test Setup

   The DUT is an IPv6 router.  The DUT is connected to a Tester by two
   links (A and B).  Link A capabilities must be identical to Link B
   capabilities.  For example, if the interface to Link A is a 10
   Gigabit Ethernet port, the interface to Link B must also be a 10
   Gigabit Ethernet port.  Furthermore, Link A and Link B must be
   lossless.

2.1.  Device Under Test (DUT)

2.1.1.  Interfaces

   DUT interfaces are numbered as follows:

   o  Link A - 2001:2:0:0::2/64

   o  Link B- 2001:2:0:1::1/64

   Both DUT interfaces should be configured with a 1500-byte MTU.
   However, if they cannot support a 1500-byte MTU, they may be
   configured with a 1280-byte MTU.

2.1.2.  Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

   NDP is enabled on both DUT interfaces.  Therefore, the DUT emits both
   solicited and unsolicited Router Advertisement (RA) messages.  The
   DUT emits an RA message at least once every 600 seconds and no more
   frequently than once every 200 seconds.



Cerveny, et al.          Expires March 26, 2017                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              NDP Benchmarking              September 2016


   When the DUT sends an RA message, it includes the following
   information:

   o  Router Lifetime - 1800 seconds

   o  Reachable Time - 0 seconds

   o  Retrans Time - 0 seconds

   o  Source Link Layer Address - Link layer address of DUT interface

   The above-mentioned values are chosen because they are the default
   values specified in RFC 4861.

   NDP also manages the NC.  Each NC entry represents an on-link
   neighbor and is identified by the neighbor's on-link unicast IP
   address.  NC entries contain the neighbor's link-layer address, a
   state variable, and several timers that are used by the Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection (NUD) algorithm.  Section 7.3 of RFC 4861
   provides NUD details.  On the DUT, NUD uses the protocol constants
   defined in Section 10 of RFC 4861.  As per these specifications, each
   NC entry needs to be refreshed at least every 60 seconds.  NDP
   refreshes NC entries by exchanging Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and
   Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages.

   No static NC entries are configured on the DUT.

2.1.3.  Routing

   The DUT maintains a direct route to 2001:2:0:0/64 through Link A.  It
   also maintains a direct route to 2001:2:0:1/64 through Link B.  No
   static routes or dynamic routing protocols are configured on the DUT.

2.2.  Tester

2.2.1.  Interfaces

   Interfaces are numbered as follows:

   o  Link A - 2001:2:0:0::1/64

   o  Link B - Multiple addresses are configured on Link B.  These
      addresses are drawn sequentially from the 2001:2:0:1::/64 address
      block.  The first address is 2001:2:0:1::2/64.  Subsequent
      addresses are 2001:2:0:1::3/64, 2001:2:0:1::4/64,
      2001:2:0:1::5/64, et cetera.  The number of configured addresses
      should be the expected value of NDP-MAX-NEIGHBORS times 1.1.

   Both Tester interfaces should be configured with a 1500-byte MTU.
   However, if they cannot support a 1500-byte MTU, they may be
   configured with a 1280-byte MTU.

2.2.2.  Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

   NDP is enabled on both Tester interfaces.  Therefore, upon
   initiation, the Tester sends Router Solicitation (RS) messages and
   waits for Router Advertisement (RA) messages.  The Tester also
   exchanges Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA)
   messages with the DUT.

   No static NC entries are configured on the Tester.

2.2.3.  Routing

   The Tester maintains a direct route to 2001:2:0:0/64 through Link A.
   It also maintains a direct route to 2001:2:0:1/64 through Link B.  No
   static routes or dynamic routing protocols are configured on the
   Tester.

2.2.4.  Test Traffic

   The Tester sends a stream test traffic through Link A to the DUT.
   The test traffic stream contains one or more interleaved flows.
   Flows are numbered 1 through N, sequentially.

   Within each flow, each packet contains an IPv6 header and each IPv6
   header contains the following information:

   o  Version - 6

   o  Traffic Class - 0

   o  Flow Label - 0

   o  Payload Length - 0

   o  Next Header - IPv6-NoNxt (59)

   o  Hop Limit - 255

   o  Source Address - 2001:2:0:0::1

   o  Destination Address - The first 64 bits of the Destination Address
      are 2001:2:0:1::. The next 64 are uniquely associated with the
      flow.  Every packet in the first flow carries the Destination
      address 2001:2:0:1::2.  Every subsequent flow has an IP address

      one greater than the last (i.e., 2001:2:0:1::3, 2001:2:0:1::4,
      etc.)

   In order to avoid link congestion, test traffic is offered at a rate
   not to exceed 50% of available link bandwidth.  In order to avoid
   burstiness and buffer occupancy, every packet in the stream is
   exactly 40 bytes long (i.e., the length of an IPv6 header with no
   IPv6 payload).  Furthermore, the gap between packets is identical.

   During the course of a test procedure, the number of flows that the
   test stream contains may increase.  When this occurs, the rate at
   which test traffic is offered remains constant.  For example, assume
   that a test stream is offered at a rate of 1,000 packets per second.
   This stream contains two flows, each contributing 500 packets per
   second to the 1,000 packet per second aggregate.  When a third stream
   is added to the flow, all three streams must contribute 333 packets
   per second in order to maintain the 1,000 packet per second limit.
   (As in this example, rounding error is acceptable.)

   The DUT attempts to forward every packet in the test stream through
   Link B to the Tester.  It does this because:

   o  Every packet in the test stream has a destination address drawn
      from the 2001:2:0:1::/64 address block

   o  The DUT has a direct route to 2001:2:0:1/64 through Link B

2.2.5.  Counters

   For each address configured on the Tester interface to Link B, two
   counters are configured.  One counter, configured on the Tester
   interface to Link A, increments when the Tester detects an outgoing
   packet from the associated flow.  The other counter, configured on
   the Tester interface to Link B, increments when the Tester detects an
   incoming packet from the associated flow.  In order for a packet to
   be associated with a flow, the following conditions must all be true:

   o  The IPv6 Destination Address must be that of the flow

   o  The IPv6 Next Header must be IPv6-NoNxt (59)

   The following counters also are configured on both Tester Interfaces:

   o  RS packets sent

   o  RS packets received

   o  RA packets sent

   o  RA packets received

   o  NS packets sent

   o  NS packets received

   o  NA packets sent

   o  NA packets received

   o  Total packets sent

   o  Total packets received

3.  Tests

3.1.  Baseline Test

   The purpose of the Baseline Test is to ensure that the DUT can
   forward every packet in the test stream, wThithout loss, when NDP is
   minimally exercised and not operating near its scaling limit.

3.1.1.  Procedure

   o  Reset all counters on the Tester

   o  Clear the NC on the DUT

   o  Set a timer to expire in 60 seconds

   o  Start the test stream with exactly one flow (i.e., IPv6
      Destination Address equals 2001:2:0:1::2)

   o  Wait for either the timer to expire or the packets-received
      counter associated with the flow to increment

   o  If the timer expires, stop the test stream and end the test

   o  If the packets-received counter increments, pause the traffic
      stream, clear the timer, log the counters associated with the
      flow, clear the counters associated with the flow, reset the timer
      to expire in 1800 seconds and restart the traffic stream

   o  When the timer expires, stop the test stream, log all counters and
      end the test

Internet-Draft              NDP Benchmarking              September 2016


3.1.2.  Results

   The two counters associated with the flow (packets-sent and packets-
   received) must have equal values.  If they do not, an error has
   occurred.  Because this error is likely to affect Scaling Test
   results, the error must be corrected before the Scaling Test is
   executed.

   The log contains two counters (packets-sent and packets-received) for
   the flow.  If these values are identical, none of the initial packets
   belonging to the flow were lost.  However, if packets-sent is greater
   than packets received, initial packets were lost.  This loss of
   initial packets is acceptable.

3.2.  Scaling Test

   The purpose of the Scaling Test is to discover the number of
   neighbors to which an IPv6 node can send traffic during periods of
   high NDP activity.  We call this number NDP-MAX-NEIGHBORS.

3.2.1.  Procedure

   Execute the following procedure:

   o  Clear all counters on the Tester

   o  Clear the NC on the DUT

   o  Set a timer to expire in 60 seconds

   o  Start the test stream with exactly one flow (i.e., IPv6
      Destination Address equals 2001:2:0:1::2)

   o  Wait for either the timer to expire or the packets-received
      counter associated with the flow to increment

   o  If the timer expires, stop the test stream and end the test

   o  If the packets-received counter increments, proceed as described
      below:

   Execute the following procedure N times, starting at 2 and ending at
   the number of expected value of NDP-MAX-NEIGHBORS time 1.1.

   o  Pause the test stream

   o  Clear the timer

Internet-Draft              NDP Benchmarking              September 2016


   o  Log the time, the value of N minus one, and the packets-sent and
      packets-received counters associated with the previous flow (i.e.,
      N minus one)

   o  Clear the packets-sent and packets-received counters associated
      with the previous flow (i.e., N minus one)

   o  Reset the timer to expire in 60 seconds

   o  Add the next flow to the test stream (i.e.,IPv6 Destination
      Address is a function of N)

   o  Restart the test stream

   o  Wait for either the timer to expire or the packets-received
      counter associated with the new flow to increment

   After the above described procedure had been executed N times, clear
   the timer and reset it to expire in 1800 seconds.  When the timer
   expires, stop the stream, log all counters and end the test.

3.2.2.  Results

   The test report includes the following:

   o  A description of the DUT (make, model, processor, memory,
      interfaces)

   o  Rate at which the Tester offers test traffic to the DUT (measured
      in packets per second)

   o  A log that records the time at which each flow was introduced to
      the test stream

   o  All counter values

   NDP-MAX-NEIGHBORS is equal to the number of counter pairs where
   packets-sent is equal to packets-recieved.  Two counters are members
   of a pair if they are both associated with the same IPv6 address.  If
   packets-sent is greater than zero and equal to packets-recieved for
   every counter pair, the test should be repeated with a larger
   expected value of NDP-MAX-NEIGHBORS.

   If an implementation abides by the recommendation of RFC 6583, for
   any given counter pair, packets-received will either be equal to zero
   or packets-received.

   The log documents the time at which each flow was introduced to the
   test stream.  This log reveals the effect of NC size to the time
   required to discover a new IPv6 neighbor.

   The log contains two counters (packets-sent and packets-received) for
   each flow.  If these values are identical, none of the initial
   packets belonging to the flow were lost.  However, if packets-sent is
   greater than packets received, initial packets were lost.  This loss
   of initial packets is acceptable.

4.  Measurements Explicitly Excluded

   These are measurements which aren't recommended because of the
   itemized reasons below:

4.1.  DUT CPU Utilization

   This measurement relies on the DUT to provide utilization
   information, which is subjective.

4.2.  Malformed Packets

   This benchmarking test is not intended to test DUT behavior in the
   presence of malformed packets.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.  Special
