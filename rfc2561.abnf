length = two-octet length of the data portion of the
                     trace element, not including the length and
                     type octets

                     defined values are:

                     X'01' telnet PDU from the server to the client
                     X'02' telnet PDU from the client to the server
                     X'03' SNA data from the server to the SNA host
                     X'04' SNA data from the SNA host to the server

data   = initial part of a PDU.
