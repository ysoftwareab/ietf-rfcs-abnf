Internet-Draft        Multicast VPN Considerations          January 2007


1.  Introduction

   The current proposal for multicast in BGP/MPLS
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] includes multiple alternative
   mechanisms for some of the required building blocks of the solution.
   However, it does not identify the core set of mechanisms which must
   be implemented in order to ensure interoperability.  This may lead to
   a situation where implementations may support different subsets of
   the available optional mechanisms leading to implementations that do
   not interoperate.

   The aim of this document is to leverage the already expressed
   requirements [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] to identify the
   mechanisms that the authors believe are good candidates for being
   part of a core set of mandatory mechanisms which can be used to
   provide a base for interoperable solutions.

   This document will go through the different building blocks of the
   solution and provide the authors' recommendations as to which
   mechanisms the authors' favor for each building block, while
   considering the requirements already defined and the goal of a fully-
   interoperable standard.

   Considering the history of the multicast VPN proposals and
   implementations, the authors also consider it useful to depict how
   existing deployments of early implementations
   [I-D.rosen-vpn-mcast][I-D.raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn] can fit in the
   picture, and provide suggestions in this respect.

   Please refer to [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] and
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts].


3.  Examining alternatives mechanisms for MVPN functions

3.1.  MVPN auto-discovery

   Section 5.2.10 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] states "The
   operation of a multicast VPN solution SHALL be as light as possible
   and providing automatic configuration and discovery SHOULD be a
   priority when designing a multicast VPN solution.  Particularly the
   operational burden of setting up multicast on a PE or for a VR/VRF
   SHOULD be as low as possible".

   The current solution document [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast]

Internet-Draft        Multicast VPN Considerations          January 2007


   addresses this requirement by proposing two different mechanisms for
   MVPN auto-discovery:

   1.  BGP-based auto-discovery (described in section 4).

   2.  Discovery using PIM running on a MI-PMSI implemented with a
       shared tree using multicast ASM, or MP2MP LDP with the same
       common tree identifier configured in all VRFs of an MVPN.

   It is the recommendation of the authors that BGP-based auto-discovery
   is the preferred solution for auto-discovery and should be supported
   by all implementations while PIM/shared-tree based auto-discovery
   should be optionally considered for migration purpose only.

   Part of the rationale for this recommendation is also based on
   section 5.2.10 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] which states "as
   far as possible, the design of a solution SHOULD carefully consider
   the number of protocols within the core network: if any additional
   protocols are introduced compared with the unicast VPN service, the
   balance between their advantage and operational burden SHOULD be
   examined thoroughly".

   BGP is indeed the auto-discovery protocol used in unicast (RFC4364)
   VPNs and therefore the use of BGP-based auto-discovery within
   multicast VPNs avoids the introduction of an additional auto-
   discovery protocol that would require additional OAM processes and
   tools.  Service providers with deployed unicast (RFC4364) VPNs
   already have extensive deployment and operations experience of using
   BGP as an auto-discovery protocol including OAM processes and tools.
   Such processes and tools will require modifications in order to
   support multicast auto-discovery but those modifications are
   anticipated to be less than those required to develop new processes
   and tools for a specific auto-discovery protocol.  Additionally, BGP
   supports MD5 authentication of its peers for additional security.  In
   contrast, there are no obvious authentication mechanisms to secure
   PIM communications in any known implementation.

   Furthermore, PIM based discovery is only applicable to deployments
   using a shared tree on an MI-PMSI, whereas BGP-based auto-discovery
   does not place any restrictions on the type of multicast trees that
   can be used.  BGP-based auto-discovery is independent of the type of
   P-multicast tree used thus satisfying the requirement in section
   5.2.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] that "a multicast VPN
   solution SHOULD be designed so that control and forwarding planes are
   not interdependent".  Additionaly, it is to be noted that a number of
   service providers have chosen to use SSM-based trees for the default
   MDTs within their current deploymentsn, therefore relying already on
   BGP-based auto-discovery.

Internet-Draft        Multicast VPN Considerations          January 2007


   When shared trees are used, the use of BGP autodiscovery would allow
   inconsistencies in the addresses/identifiers used for the shared
   trees to be detected (e.g. the same shared tree identifier being used
   for different VPNs with distinct BGP route targets).  This is
   particularly attractive in the context of inter-AS VPNs where the
   impact of any misconfiguration could be magnified and where a single
   service provider may not operate all the ASs.

   The authors note that, in order to support the coexistence of both
   protocols (for example during migration scenarios), implementations
   could support both alternatives by providing a per-VRF configuration
   knob that would allow recognizing new PIM neighbors based on the
   reception of PIM hellos on a shared P-multicast tree, even for
   neighbors that did not advertise a BGP auto discovery route.

3.2.  S-PMSI Signaling

   The current solution document [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] proposes
   two mechanisms for S-PMSI Signaling:

   1.  A new UDP-based TLV protocol specifically for S-PMSI signaling
       (described in section 7.2.1).

   2.  A BGP-based mechanism for S-PMSI signaling (described in section
       7.2.2).

   It is the recommendation of the authors that BGP is the preferred
   solution for S-PMSI signaling and should be supported by all
   implementations while the UDP-based S-PMSI signaling protocol should
   be considered optional.

   Part of the rationale for this recommendation is similar to that for
   BGP-based auto-discovery and is based on section 5.2.10 of
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] and the desire to avoid
   introducing and deploying additional protocols unless strictly
   necessary.

   Furthermore:

   o  The BGP-based S-PMSI signaling mechanism can be used within MVPNs
      using either a UI-PMSI or a MI-PMSI while the UDP-based protocol
      is restricted to use within MVPNs using an MI-PMSI.

   o  The BGP-based S-PMSI signaling mechanism can be efficiently used
      in an inter-AS option B deployment context while the use of the
      UDP-based protocol does not preserve AS routing independence when
      used in an inter-AS option B context (i.e. the decision by a PE in
      an AS to use an S-PMSI for a given customer flow will impact



Morin, et al.             Expires July 19, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Multicast VPN Considerations          January 2007


      routing state in other ASes).  Co-existence with unicast inter-AS
      VPN options is strongly encouraged by section 5.2.6 of
      [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts].

   o  The BGP-based S-PMSI signaling supports all the functionality and
      all the operational contexts that are supported by UDP-based
      protocol (and more).

   o  BGP supports MD5 authentication of its peers for additional
      security.  In contrast, there are no obvious authentication
      mechanisms to secure PIM communications in any known
      implementation.

   Therefore, it is the opinion of the authors that BGP is the preferred
   solution for performing S-PMSI signaling.

   However, the authors recognize that the UDP-based protocol has been
   in deployment for some time and would recommend that implementations
   supporting both protocols optionally provide a per-VRF configuration
   knob to allow an implementation to use the UDP-based TLV protocol for
   S-PMSI signaling for specific VRFs in order to support the
   coexistence of both protocols (for example during migration
   scenarios).

   Apart from such migration-facilitating mechanisms, the authors
   specifically do not recommend extending the already proposed UDP-
   based TLV protocal to new types of P-multicast trees.

   Section 7.2.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] proposes two
   approaches for how a source PE can decide when to start transmitting
   customer multicast traffic on a S-PMSI:

   1.  The source PE sends multicast packets for the <C-S, C-G> on both
       the I-PMSI P-multicast tree and the S-PMSI P-multicast tree
       simultaneously for a pre-configured period of time, letting the
       receiver PEs select the new tree for reception, before switching
       to only the S-PMSI.

   2.  The source PE waits for a pre-configured period of time after
       advertising the <C-S, C-G> entry bound to the S-PMSI before fully
       switching the traffic onto the S-PMSI-bound P-multicast tree.

   The first alternative has essentially two drawbacks:

   o  <C-S,C-G> traffic is sent twice for some periode of time, for a
      stream for which bandwidth optimization just happen to be
      considered useful




Morin, et al.             Expires July 19, 2007                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Multicast VPN Considerations          January 2007


   o  it is unlikely that the switch can happen without packet loss or
      duplicates, as soon as the transit delay of the I-PMSI P-multicast
      tree and the S-PMSI P-multicast tree are different

   By contrast, the second alternative has none of these drawbacks, and
   would meet the requirement made in section 5.1.3 of requirements
   stating that "[...] a multicast VPN solution SHOULD as much as
   possible ensure that client multicast traffic packets are neither
   lost nor duplicated, even when changes occur in the way a client
   multicast data stream is carried over the provider network".  The
   second alternative also happen to be the one used in existing
   deployments.

   For these reasons, it is the author recomandation to mandate the
   implementation of this second alternative for switching to S-PMSI.

3.3.  PE-PE Transmission of C-Multicast Routing

   The current solution document [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] proposes
   multiple mechanisms for PE-PE transmission of customer multicast
   routing information:

   1.  Full per-MVPN PIM peering across an MI-PMSI (described in section
       5.2.1).

   2.  Lightweight PIM peering across an MI-PMSI (described in section
       5.2.2)

   3.  The unicasting of PIM C-Join/Prune messages (described in section
       5.2.3)

   4.  The use of BGP for carrying C-Multicast routing (described in
       section 5.3).

   The first mechanism (full per-MVPN PIM peering across an MI-PMSI) is
   the mechanism used by [I-D.rosen-vpn-mcast] and therefore it is
   deployed and operating in MVPNs today.  The authors recognize that
   because full per-MVPN PIM peering has been in deployment for some
   time support for this mechanism may be required for backwards
   compatibility and in order to facilitate migration towards
   alternative PE-PE protocols.

   Section 4.2.4 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] recommends that
   "a multicast VPN solution SHOULD support several hundreds of PEs per
   multicast VPN, and MAY usefully scale up to thousands" and section
   4.2.5 states that "a solution SHOULD scale up to thousands of PEs
   having multicast service enabled".

Internet-Draft        Multicast VPN Considerations          January 2007


   At those scales of multicast deployment within a large VPN, the first
   and third mechanisms require PEs to maintain a large number of PIM
   adjacencies with other PEs within the same MVPN and to regularly
   exchange PIM hellos with each other and refresh C-Join/Prune state.

   The third mechanism would reduce the amount of C-Join/Prune
   processing by PEs when they are not the upstream neighbor for a given
   multicast flow, but would :

   a.  require explicit tracking related state to be maintained by PEs
       when they are the upstream PE for a said customer flow, and

   b.  require refresh reduction mechanisms to be used to be applicable.

   The second mechanism (lightweight PIM peering across an MI-PMSI)
   would operate in a similar manner to full per-MVPN PIM peering except
   that PIM hellos are not transmitted and PIM C-Join/Prune refresh
   reduction would be used, thereby improving scalability.

   The fourth mechanism (the use of BGP for carrying C-Multicast
   routing) has to solve roughly the same intrinsic scalability related
   difficulties as the other three mechanisms, but because it is based
   on TCP it has no refresh-related scalability limit, and inherits some
   BGP features that are expected to improve scalability through, for
   instance, providing a means to offload some of the processing burden
   associated with client multicast routing onto BGP route reflectors.

   Furthermore, co-existence with unicast inter-AS VPN options, and an
   equal level of security for multicast and unicast including in an
   inter-AS context, are specifically mentioned in sections 5.2.6, 5.2.8
   and 5.2.12 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts].  The first three
   mechanisms impose direct PE to PE communications which means that
   they do not apply well to an inter-AS option B context, because of
   security and robustness issues that are involved by such a level of
   reachability and interaction between PEs in different ASes.  Their
   use in an inter-AS context is possible, but not without limitations
   or additional engineering design trade-offs depending upon the
   interconnect types.  By comparison, the fourth option (the use of BGP
   for carrying C-Multicast routing) does not have any of the above
   limitations related to inter-AS deployments, and also provides an
   additional alternative to facilitate such deployments through the
   possibility of using segmented inter-AS trees.

   Moreover, mechanisms one and two are restricted to use within MVPNs
   using an MI-PMSI, thereby necessitating:






Morin, et al.             Expires July 19, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Multicast VPN Considerations          January 2007


   a.  The use of a P-multicast tree technique that allows shared trees
       (for example PIM-SM in ASM mode or MP2MP LDP).

   b.  The use of one P-multicast tree per PE per VPN, even for PEs that
       do not have sources in their directly attached sites for that
       VPN.

   By comparision, the fourth mechanism doesn't impose either of these
   restrictions.

   Additionally, the fourth mechanism (the use of BGP for carrying
   C-Multicast routing) would appear to fit well with the current
   unicast architecture as BGP is the customer routing distribution
   protocol used in unicast VPNs and therefore using BGP for customer
   routing distribution within multicast VPNs avoids the introduction of
   an additional protocol that would require additional OAM processes
   and tools.  Service provider's with deployed unicast (RFC4364) VPNs
   already have extensive deployment and operations experience of using
   BGP as a customer routing distribution protocol including OAM
   processes and tools.  Such processes and tools will require
   modification in order to support customer multicast routing but those
   modifications are anticipated to be less than those required to
   develop new processes and tools for a distinct customer routing
   protocol.  It should be noted that because PIM will be used as the
   CE-PE customer routing distribution protocol, service providers will
   still need OAM processes and tools in order to manage the PIM
   protocol, so this rationale only applies to a subset of the tools and
   processes already in place.  Additionally, BGP supports MD5
   authentication of its peers for additional security.  In contrast,
   there are no obvious authentication mechanisms to secure PIM
   communications in any known implementation.

   An illustrative example of the benefit brought by consistency with
   unicast design is how the "extranet" feature can be implemented :
   when BGP-based mechanisms are used, the well defined and well
   understood BGP route target import/export semantics are just reused.
   By contrast, it is not specified how implementing the same feature
   would be done in the context of other alternative mechanism, and
   unclear if this is possible without significant engineering trade-
   offs.  Note that the support for such a feature is stated as a MUST
   in sections 5.1.6 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts].

   Section 5.2.10 of requiremnts [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts]
   states that "as far as possible, the design of a solution SHOULD
   carefully consider the number of protocols within the core network:
   if any additional protocols are introduced compared with the unicast
   VPN service, the balance between their advantage and operational
   burden SHOULD be examined thoroughly".  Considering that the

   recommendation of the authors would be BGP for auto-discovery and
   S-PMSI signalling, the choice of BGP for customer multicast routing
   would be consistent with the protocol choice for unicast VPNs and
   would adequately address this requirement.

   BGP-based customer multicast routing clearly presents some advantages
   over the PIM-based alternatives.  However it has yet to be deployed
   within an operational MVPN, and service providers currently lack
   experience of its implementation.  By contrast, experience proves
   that PIM-based mechanisms are operationaly viable, but with well
   identified limitations.  Some of those limitations may be improved
   upon (although there is currently no clearly defined proposal to do
   this), however some of the limitations appear to be intrinsic to the
   approach.

   Moreover to improve the clarity of the proposed specifications,
   considering that neither hello suppression nor refresh reduction
   procedures are currently specified or documented and that it is not
   clear what the impact to the PIM state machine of these additional
   procedures may be, the authors recommend that the proposals for
   lightweight PIM peering across an MI-PMSI (the second mechanism) and
   for the unicasting of PIM C-Join/Prune messages (the third mechanism)
   be removed from the current solution document
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] until the additional PIM hello and
   refresh reduction procedures have been well specified and both their
   impact and benefit on an MPVN deployment is understood.

   Consequently, at the present time and until there is experience with
   all of the proposed mechanisms it is not clear which of the above
   mechanisms should be recommended as the preferred solution to
   implementers.  However, it would appear prudent for implementations
   to consider supporting both the fourth (BGP-based) and first (full
   per-MPVN PIM peering) mechanisms.  Further experience on both
   implementation is likely to be required before some best practice can
   be defined.

3.4.  Encapsulation techniques for P-multicast trees

   In this section the authors will not make any restricting
   recommendations as the appropriateness of a specific core (P) data
   plane technology will depend on a large number of factors, for
   example the service provider's currently deployed unicast data plane,
   many of which are service provider specific.

   However, implementations should not unreasonably restrict the data
   plane technology that can be used, and should not force the use of
   the same technology for different VPNs attached to a single PE.
   Initial implementations may only support a reduced set of

   encapsulation techniques and data plane technologies but this should
   not be considered a limiting factor that hinders future support for
   other encapsulation techniques, data plane technologies or
   interoperability.

   Section 5.2.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] states "In a
   multicast VPN solution extending a unicast L3 PPVPN solution,
   consistency in the tunneling technology has to be favored: such a
   solution SHOULD allow the use of the same tunneling technology for
   multicast as for unicast.  Deployment consistency, ease of operation
   and potential migrations are the main motivations behind this
   requirement."

   Current unicast VPN deployments use a variety of LDP, RSVP-TE and
   GRE/IP for encapsulating customer packets for transport across the
   provider core of VPN services.  It is recommended that
   implementations support the three corresponding multicast tree
   encapsulations techniques, namely: mLDP, P2MP RSVP-TE and GRE/IP
   multicast in order to allow the same encapsulations to be used for
   unicast and multicast traffic as well as facilitating migration from
   [I-D.rosen-vpn-mcast] to an MPLS label based encapsulation.

3.5.  Inter-AS deployments options

   Section 5.2.6 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] states "A
   solution MUST support inter-AS multicast VPNs, and SHOULD support
   inter-provider multicast VPNs.  Considerations about coexistence with
   unicast inter-AS VPN Options A, B and C (as described in section 10
   of [RFC4364]) are strongly encouraged." and "A multicast VPN solution
   SHOULD provide inter-AS mechanisms requiring the least possible
   coordination between providers, and keep the need for detailed
   knowledge of providers' networks to a minimum - all this being in
   comparison with corresponding unicast VPN options."

   Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] addresses these
   requirements by proposing two approaches for mVPN inter-AS
   deployments:

   1.  Segmented inter-AS tunnels where each AS constructs its own
       separate multicast tunnels which are then 'stitched' together by
       the ASBRs (described in section 8.2).

   2.  Non-segmented inter-AS tunnels where the multicast tunnels are
       end-to-end across ASes, so even though the PEs belonging to a
       given MVPN may be in different ASes the ASBRs play no special
       role and function merely as P routers (described in section 8.1).

   Section 5.2.6 of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-mcast-reqts] also states

   "Within each service provider the service provider SHOULD be able on
   its own to pick the most appropriate tunneling mechanism to carry
   (multicast) traffic among PEs (just like what is done today for
   unicast)".  However, the applicability of segmented or non-segmented
   inter-AS tunnels to a given deployment or inter-provider interconnect
   will depend on a number of factors specific to each service provider.
   It is therefore the recommendation of the authors that implementation
   should support both segmented and non-segmented inter-AS tunnels,
   although it is recognised that initial implementations may only
   support one or the other.

   Additionally, the authors note that the proposed BGP-based approaches
   for S-PMSI signaling and C-multicast routing information distribution
   provide a good fit with both segmented and non-segmented inter-AS
   tunnels.  In contrast the UDP-TLV based approach for S-PSMI signaling
   appears to be incompatible with segmented inter-AS tunnels, and it is
   unclear if the proposed PIM-based approaches for C-multicast routing
   information distribution would be fully applicable to segmented
   inter-AS tunnels.


4.  Existing deployments

   Some suggestions provided in this document can be used to
   incrementally modify currently deployed implementations without
   hindering these deployments, and without hindering the consistency of
   the standardized solution : optionnaly providing a per-VRF tunable to
   support a mode of operation compatible with currently deployed
   implementations, while using at the same time the recommended
   approach with implementation supporting the standard.

   In cases where this may not be easily doable, a recommended approach
   would be to provide a per-VRF tunable allowing incremental per-VPN
   migration of the mechanisms used by a PE device, which would allow
   migration with some per-VPN interruption of service (e.g. on non-peak
   hours).

   Mechanisms allowing "live" migration by providing concurrent use of
   multiple alternatives for a said PE and a said VPN, is not seen as a
   priority considering the expected associated implementation
   complexity.  However, if there happen to be cases where they could be
   relatively simple and viable, such mechanisms may help improve
   migration management.
