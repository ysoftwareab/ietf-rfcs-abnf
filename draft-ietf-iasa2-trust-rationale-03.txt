  Discussion of the IASA 2.0 Changes as They Relate to the IETF Trust
                  draft-ietf-iasa2-trust-rationale-03

Abstract

   This document is published to capture the rationale for the changes
   introduced in RFC NNNN (RFC Editor: please replace NNNN with the RFC
   number of [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update]), Update to the Process for
   Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust.

   At the time RFC NNNN was published, IETF administrative structure
   changes ("IASA 2.0") had an impact on the IETF Trust because members
   of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), which was
   being phased out, had served as Trustees of the IETF Trust.  This
   document provides background on the past IETF Trust arrangements,
   explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents during the
   transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale for the
   update.

1.  Introduction

   This document is published to capture the rationale for the changes
   introduced in [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update].

   At the time [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update] was published, IETF
   administrative structure changes ("IASA 2.0") had an impact on the
   IETF Trust [RFC4071] [RFC4371] [I-D.ietf-iasa2-struct].  This is
   because members of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee
   (IAOC), which was being phased out, had served as Trustees of the
   IETF Trust.  A minimal change regarding the selection of the trustees
   is implemented by [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update].

   This companion memo provides some background on the details of the
   past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the
   founding documents during the transition to the new arrangement, and
   provides a rationale for the update.

2.  Background

   The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain, and
   license certain existing and future intellectual property and other
   property used in connection with the administration of the IETF
   [RFC4371].  The intellectual property is, for instance, rights that
   the IETF contributors grant for text in RFCs and Internet-Drafts.
   The IETF Trust also manages trademarks such as "IETF" and domain
   names such as "ietf.org".  The IETF Trust is also serving the broader
   Internet community by holding domains and trademarks associated with
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [RFC7979].

   The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the Commonwealth of
   Virginia [Trust-FD].

   Previously, the members of the IAOC also served as ex officio
   Trustees of the IETF Trust.  The founding documents specify persons
   eligible to become trustees as having to be then-current members of
   the IAOC [Trust-FD].  The documents also specify that if for any
   reason there are fewer than three individuals serving as Trustees,
   then the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), or the IESG's
   successor as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint one or more
   individuals to serve in a temporary capacity as Trustee(s) until
   eligible persons can be found.

   In the previous system there were eight IAOC members.  Two were named
   by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom), one by the IESG, one by
   the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and one by the Internet
   Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees.  In addition, there were three ex
   officio members via their roles as IETF Chair, ISOC CEO, and IAB
   Chair.  In addition, the IETF Administrative Director (IAD) served
   also as one of the trustees.

3.  General Approach

   There were two basic approaches to resolving the issue with the
   trustees, when the IAOC ceased to exist.  One could have imagined
   merging all IETF Trust functions in the new IASA structure and under
   the new legal entity.  This memo advocated a second approach where
   the IETF Trust is kept independent.

   The rationale for advocating the second approach is in part to
   minimize changes to the IETF Trust while the IETF's administrative
   structure is undergoing major change.  In addition, the IETF Trust
   and other administrative IETF processes are quite different.  While
   very important, the IETF Trust is a low-activity entity where changes
   are minimal and gradual, and there are no pressing issues.

4.  Changing the Way Trustees Are Selected

   At the time when the trustees served on both the IETF Trust and the
   IAOC, many of the requirements for naming a particular group of
   people were driven by the IAOC's requirements.  For the IETF Trust in
   the new model, some of those arrangements were able to be rethought,
   both in terms of the number and source of the trustees, as well as
   the desired qualifications and length of terms.

   Several options were possible, of course.  A newly designed naming
   process could have been devised.  The argument here is for a
   relatively limited change, however, largely on the basis of the IETF
   Trust arrangements generally working well, and on the relatively
   modest expected time commitments combined with the need for very
   careful management of the assets.

   As a result, a smaller group of trustees appeared sufficient.

   In addition, the terms for the trustees selected from the IETF
   community could be set to longer than the two year period typical of
   other IETF bodies.

   One could have continued the practice of having the chairs and CEOs
   from IETF, IAB, and Internet Society be trustees as well, but this
   may not be necessary.  In general, the tasks of the IETF Trust are
   well defined, and while there is a need for coordination, it does not
   need to be at the level of chairs or CEOs.

   Given all this, one approach was to have trustees appointed by the
   NomCom, IESG, and ISOC Board of Trustees.  (One might also have
   considered the IETF Administration LLC legal entity instead of the
   Internet Society for this role.  But the Internet Society is perhaps
   more suitable for the role, given their focus on the broad use of the
   IETF Trust assets and not merely administrative aspects).

   If the same principles would continue to be used as were used in
   previous appointments, then appointments performed by the NomCom
   would need to be confirmed by another entity, which could be, for
   instance, either the IESG or the IAB.  The IESG had previously been
   the confirming body for the IAOC, so it has been retained in that
   role for the trustees.

5.  Transition

   When the new entity for IETF Administration LLC was set up, the IAOC
   was expected to be discontinued soon thereafter.  Fortunately, there
   was no pressing need to change all the components of the IAOC and its
   dependent organizations at the same time.  As discussed above

   (Section 2), the IESG holds the ability to continue to name trustees.
   And once the updated procedures were in place, the IETF Trust had its
   management nominated in the usual manner, and the exceptional IESG
   process was no longer needed.
