   YANG Module for Basic Challenge-Response-based Remote Attestation
                               Procedures
            draft-birkholz-yang-basic-remote-attestation-00

Abstract

   This document defines YANG RPC and a minimal datastore required to
   retrieve integrity evidence about software from the device running
   the YANG datastore.  The module presented requires a TPM 2.0 and
   corresponding Trusted Software Stack included in the system entity
   the YANG datastore is running on.

1.  Introduction

   This document is based on the terminology defined in
   [I-D.birkholz-attestation-terminology] and uses the interaction model
   and information elements defined in Reference Interaction Model for
   Challenge/Response-based Remote Attestation Procedures.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].
