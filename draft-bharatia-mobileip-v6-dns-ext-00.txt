   Abstract 

   This draft provides an extension to Mobile IPv6 protocol where the 
   Mobile Node (MN) obtains an information regarding DNS Servers from a 
   home agent. This is achieved by defining a new extension of a 
   Binding Acknowledgement message. 

1  Introduction 

   Currently, There is no explicit mechanism defined in [MIPv6] for 
   assigning primary and secondary DNS servers in the IP network. In 
   any case, the MN has to obtain information of the DNS Servers. This 
   information can be passed to the MN by the IP network or it can be 
   obtained by some other means like the use of DHCP etc. 
    
   This draft basically considers a scenario where Mobile Node obtains 
   DNS addresses from the IP network. In this proposal, both primary 
   and secondary DNS servers are assigned by the Home Agent (HA) and 
   their information is passed to the MN after successful Mobile IPv6 
   Binding Update procedure. This proposed solution is more generic and 
   does not rely on the use of any specific link layer. Note that the 
   scope of this document is to emphasize on the mechanism by which the

   information regarding DNS server addresses are relayed to MN. It 
   does not include discussion of how DNS server addresses are obtained 
   by the HA.

3  Detailed Description of the Proposed Solution 

   This draft provides a mechanism to convey DNS addresses from the HA 
   to the MN. This information is passed to the MN during successful 
   Mobile IPv6 Binding Update procedure. 
    
   The message flow of the solution is shown in figure 1. Upon 
   successful Mobile IPv6 Binding Update, the HA appends IP addresses 
   of DNS servers in the Binding Acknowledgement message with new 
   Mobile IP extension (defined in section 4). The MN receives this 
   extension and sets the corresponding fields in the DNS lookup 
   accordingly. 
    
     MN                             HA 
     --                             -- 
   1. <----Router Advertisement----- 
   2. -----Binding Update----------> 
   3. <--Binding Acknowledgement---- 
        (w/ Sub-Options for DNS) 
    
   Figure 1-Exchanges of DNS Servers Information 
    
   Figure 1 shows message exchanges between different Mobile IP 
   entities.  

   Step 1: As per procedure mentioned in [MIPv6], the Router 
          Advertisement is sent to the MN. 
   Step 2: The MN sends a Binding Update message to the HA. It is 
          recommended that the MN should set `A' bit in the Binding 
          Update message requesting the Binding Acknowledgement from 
          the HA. 
   Step 3: The HA appends Mobile IP Sub-Options (discussed in section 
          4) for primary and secondary DNS servers. When MN receives 
          this new Mobile IP Sub-Options, it sets the DNS lookup 
          accordingly.

   The Mobile IP Sub-Optionsfor primary and secondary DNS servers shall 
   have the following format

   Type 
       DNS-IPV6-EXT-TYPE=TBD. This Sub-Options value will be assigned 
       by IANA from the   numbering space defined for Mobile IPv6 
       Binding Acknowledgement Sub-Options in [MIPv6] 
   Length 
       34 
   DNS-Address_primary 
       The DNS-Address_primary (16 octets) is the address of primary 
       DNS server to be used by the MN. 
   DNS-Address_secondary 
       The DNS-Address_secondary (16 octets) is the address of 
       secondary DNS server to be used by the MN. 

5  IANA Considerations 

   This draft defines a new Mobile IPv6 Sub-Options of type DNS-IPV6-
   EXT-TYPE as defined in section 4 of this document. The value will 
   be defined by IANA from the numbering space defined for Binding 
   Acknowledgement Sub-Options in [MIPv6]. 

6  Security Considerations 

   There are no additional security aspects imposed in this document in 
   addition to the one defined in [MIPv6].
