1.  Introduction

   Vehicular networking studies have mainly focused on improving safety
   and efficiency, and also enabling entertainment in vehicular
   networks.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US
   allocated wireless channels for Dedicated Short-Range Communications
   (DSRC) [DSRC] in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) with
   the frequency band of 5.850 - 5.925 GHz (i.e., 5.9 GHz band).  DSRC-
   based wireless communications can support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),
   vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
   networking.  The European Union (EU) allocated radio spectrum for
   safety-related and non-safety-related applications of ITS with the
   frequency band of 5.875 - 5.905 GHz, as part of the Commission
   Decision 2008/671/EC [EU-2008-671-EC].

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


   For direct inter-vehicular wireless connectivity, IEEE has amended
   WiFi standard 802.11 to enable driving safety services based on DSRC
   for the Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) system.  The
   Physical Layer (L1) and Data Link Layer (L2) issues are addressed in
   IEEE 802.11p [IEEE-802.11p] for the PHY and MAC of the DSRC, while
   IEEE 1609.2 [WAVE-1609.2] covers security aspects, IEEE 1609.3
   [WAVE-1609.3] defines related services at network and transport
   layers, and IEEE 1609.4 [WAVE-1609.4] specifies the multi-channel
   operation.  IEEE 802.11p was first a separate amendment, but was
   later rolled into the base 802.11 standard (IEEE 802.11-2012) as IEEE
   802.11 Outside the Context of a Basic Service Set (OCB) in 2012
   [IEEE-802.11-OCB].

   Along with these WAVE standards, IPv6 [RFC8200] and Mobile IPv6
   protocols (e.g., Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC6275], and Proxy MIPv6
   (PMIPv6) [RFC5213]) can be applied to vehicular networks.  In
   addition, ISO has approved a standard specifying the IPv6 network
   protocols and services to be used for Communications Access for Land
   Mobiles (CALM) [ISO-ITS-IPv6].

   This document describes use cases and a problem statement about
   IPv6-based vehicular networking for ITS, which is named IPv6 Wireless
   Access in Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE).  First, it introduces the
   use cases for using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking in ITS.  Next, it
   makes a problem statement about key aspects in IPWAVE, namely, IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery (ND), Mobility Management (MM), and Security &
   Privacy (SP).  For each key aspect of the problem statement, this
   document specifies requirements for IPv6-based vehicular networking.
   This document is intended to motivate development of key protocols
   for IPWAVE.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [RFC8691].  In
   addition, the following terms are defined below:

   o  Class-Based Safety Plan: A vehicle can make safety plan by
      classifying the surrounding vehicles into different groups for
      safety purposes according to the geometrical relationship among
      them.  The vehicle groups can be classified as Line-of-Sight
      Unsafe, Non-Line-of-Sight Unsafe, and Safe groups [CASD].

   o  Context-Awareness: A vehicle can be aware of spatial-temporal
      mobility information (e.g., position, speed, direction, and
      acceleration/deceleration) of surrounding vehicles for both safety
      and non-safety uses through sensing or communication [CASD].

   o  Edge Computing (EC): It is the local computing near an access
      network (i.e., edge network) for the sake of vehicles and
      pedestrians.

   o  Edge Computing Device (ECD): It is a computing device (or server)
      for edge computing for the sake of vehicles and pedestrians.

   o  Edge Network (EN): In is an access network that has an IP-RSU for
      wireless communication with other vehicles having an IP-OBU and
      wired communication with other network devices (e.g., routers, IP-
      RSUs, ECDs, servers, and MA).  It may have a radio receiver of
      Global Positioning System (GPS) for its position recognition and
      the localization service for the sake of vehicles.

   o  IP-OBU: "Internet Protocol On-Board Unit": An IP-OBU denotes a
      computer situated in a vehicle such as a car, bicycle, or similar.
      It has at least one IP interface that runs in mode OCB of 802.11
      and has an "OBU" transceiver.  Also, it may have an IP interface
      that runs in Cellular V2X (C-V2X) [TS-23.285-3GPP].  See the
      definition of the term "OBU" in [RFC8691].

   o  IP-RSU: "IP Roadside Unit": An IP-RSU is situated along the road.
      It has at least two distinct IP-enabled interfaces.  The wireless
      PHY/MAC layer of at least one of its IP-enabled interfaces is

      with the IP-OBU over an 802.11 wireless link operating in OCB
      mode.  Also, it may have an IP interface that runs in C-V2X along
      with an "RSU" transceiver.  An IP-RSU is similar to an Access
      Network Router (ANR), defined in [RFC3753], and a Wireless
      Termination Point (WTP), defined in [RFC5415].  See the definition
      of the term "RSU" in [RFC8691].

   o  LiDAR: "Light Detection and Ranging".  It is a scanning device to
      measure a distance to an object by emitting pulsed laser light and
      measuring the reflected pulsed light.

   o  Mobility Anchor (MA): A node that maintains IPv6 addresses and
      mobility information of vehicles in a road network to support
      their IPv6 address autoconfiguration and mobility management with
      a binding table.  An MA has End-to-End (E2E) connections with IP-
      RSUs under its control for the address autoconfiguration and
      mobility management of the vehicles.  This MA can play a role of a
      Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in PMIPv6 [RFC5213] for vehicles
      moving in the road network .

   o  OCB: "Outside the Context of a Basic Service Set - BSS".  It is a

      association, or data confidentiality [IEEE-802.11-OCB].

   o  802.11-OCB: It refers to the mode specified in IEEE Std
      802.11-2016 [IEEE-802.11-OCB] when the MIB attribute
      dot11OCBActivited is 'true'.

   o  Platooning: Moving vehicles can be grouped together to reduce air-
      resistance for energy efficiency and reduce the number of drivers
      such that only the leading vehicle has a driver and the other
      vehicles are autonomous vehicles without a driver and closely
      following the leading vehicle [Truck-Platooning].

   o  Traffic Control Center (TCC): A node that maintains road
      infrastructure information (e.g., IP-RSUs, traffic signals, and
      loop detectors), vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., average
      vehicle speed and vehicle inter-arrival time per road segment),
      and vehicle information (e.g., a vehicle's identifier, position,
      direction, speed, and trajectory as a navigation path).  TCC is
      included in a vehicular cloud for vehicular networks.

   o  Vehicle: A Vehicle in this document is a node that has an IP-OBU
      for wireless communication with other vehicles and IP-RSUs.  It
      has a radio navigation receiver of Global Positioning System (GPS)
      for efficient navigation.

   o  Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET): A network that consists of
      vehicles interconnected by wireless communication.  Two vehicles
      in a VANET can communicate with each other using other vehicles as
      relays even where they are out of one-hop wireless communication
      range.

   o  Vehicular Cloud: A cloud infrastructure for vehicular networks,
      having compute nodes, storage nodes, and network forwarding
      elements (e.g., switch and router).

   o  Vehicle Detection Loop (i.e., Loop Detector): An inductive device
      used for detecting vehicles passing or arriving at a certain
      point, for instance, at an intersection with traffic lights or at
      a ramp toward a highway.  The relatively crude nature of the
      loop's structure means that only metal masses above a certain size
      are capable of triggering the detection.

   o  V2D: "Vehicle to Device".  It is the wireless communication
      between a vehicle and a device (e.g., IoT device).

   o  V2P: "Vehicle to Pedestrian".  It is the wireless communication
      between a vehicle and a pedestrian's mobile device (e.g.,
      smartphone).

   o  V2I2P: "Vehicle to Infrastructure to Pedestrian".  It is the

      security and privacy for vehicular networks.

   o  WAVE: "Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments" [WAVE-1609.0].

3.  Use Cases

   This section explains use cases of V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  The
   use cases of the V2X networking exclude the ones of the V2V and V2I
   networking, but include Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) and Vehicle-to-
   Device (V2D).

   Since IP is widely used among various computing devices in the
   Internet, it is expected that the use cases in this section need to
   work on top of IPv6 as the network layer protocol.  Thus, the IPv6
   for these use cases should be extended for vehicular IPv6 such that
   the IPv6 can support the functions of the network layer protocol such
   as Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND), Vehicular Mobility Management
   (VMM), and Vehicular Security and Privacy (VSP) in vehicular
   networks.  Refer to Section 5 for the problem statement of the
   requirements of the vehicular IPv6.

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


3.1.  V2V

   The use cases of V2V networking discussed in this section include

   o  Context-aware navigation for driving safety and collision
      avoidance;

   o  Cooperative adaptive cruise control in an urban roadway;

   o  Platooning in a highway;

   o  Cooperative environment sensing.

   These four techniques will be important elements for self-driving
   vehicles.

   Context-Aware Safety Driving (CASD) navigator [CASD] can help drivers
   to drive safely by alerting the drivers about dangerous obstacles and
   situations.  That is, CASD navigator displays obstacles or
   neighboring vehicles relevant to possible collisions in real-time
   through V2V networking.  CASD provides vehicles with a class-based
   automatic safety action plan, which considers three situations,
   namely, the Line-of-Sight unsafe, Non-Line-of-Sight unsafe, and safe
   situations.  This action plan can be put into action among multiple
   vehicles using V2V networking.

   Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) [CA-Cruise-Control] helps
   vehicles to adapt their speed autonomously through V2V communication
   among vehicles according to the mobility of their predecessor and
   successor vehicles in an urban roadway or a highway.  Thus, CACC can
   help adjacent vehicles to efficiently adjust their speed in an
   interactive way through V2V networking in order to avoid collision.

   Platooning [Truck-Platooning] allows a series of vehicles (e.g.,
   trucks) to follow each other very closely.  Trucks can use V2V
   communication in addition to forward sensors in order to maintain
   constant clearance between two consecutive vehicles at very short
   gaps (from 3 meters to 10 meters).  Platooning can maximize the
   throughput of vehicular traffic in a highway and reduce the gas
   consumption because the leading vehicle can help the following
   vehicles to experience less air resistance.

   Cooperative-environment-sensing use cases suggest that vehicles can
   share environmental information from various vehicle-mounted sensors,
   such as radars, LiDARs, and cameras with other vehicles and
   pedestrians.  [Automotive-Sensing] introduces a millimeter-wave
   vehicular communication for massive automotive sensing.  A lot of
   data can be generated by those sensors, and these data typically need



Jeong, Ed.                Expires July 9, 2020                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


   to be routed to different destinations.  In addition, from the
   perspective of driverless vehicles, it is expected that driverless
   vehicles can be mixed with driver-operated vehicles.  Through the
   cooperative environment sensing, driver-operated vehicles can use
   environmental information sensed by driverless vehicles for better
   interaction with the other vehicles and environment.

   To support the applications of these V2V use cases, the functions of
   IPv6 such as VND and VSP are prerequisite for the IPv6-based packet
   exchange and the secure, safe communication between two vehicles.

3.2.  V2I

   The use cases of V2I networking discussed in this section include

   o  Navigation service;

   o  Energy-efficient speed recommendation service;

   o  Accident notification service.

   A navigation service, for example, the Self-Adaptive Interactive
   Navigation Tool (SAINT) [SAINT], using V2I networking interacts with
   TCC for the large-scale/long-range road traffic optimization and can
   guide individual vehicles for appropriate navigation paths in real
   time.  The enhanced version of SAINT [SAINTplus] can give fast moving
   paths to emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulance and fire engine) to let
   them reach an accident spot while redirecting other vehicles near the
   accident spot into efficient detour paths.

   A TCC can recommend an energy-efficient speed to a vehicle that
   depends on its traffic environment.  [Fuel-Efficient] studies fuel-
   efficient route and speed plans for platooned trucks.

   The emergency communication between accident vehicles (or emergency
   vehicles) and TCC can be performed via either IP-RSU or 4G-LTE
   networks.  The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet)
   [FirstNet] is provided by the US government to establish, operate,
   and maintain an interoperable public safety broadband network for
   safety and security network services, e.g., emergency calls.  The
   construction of the nationwide FirstNet network requires each state
   in the US to have a Radio Access Network (RAN) that will connect to
   the FirstNet's network core.  The current RAN is mainly constructed
   by 4G-LTE for the communication between a vehicle and an
   infrastructure node (i.e., V2I) [FirstNet-Report], but it is expected
   that DSRC-based vehicular networks [DSRC] will be available for V2I
   and V2V in near future.

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


   To support the applications of these V2I use cases, the functions of
   IPv6 such as VND, VMM, and VSP are prerequisite for the IPv6-based
   packet exchange, the transport-layer session continuity, and the
   secure, safe communication between a vehicle and a server in the
   vehicular cloud.

3.3.  V2X

   The use case of V2X networking discussed in this section is
   pedestrian protection service.

   A pedestrian protection service, such as Safety-Aware Navigation
   Application (SANA) [SANA], using V2I2P networking can reduce the
   collision of a vehicle and a pedestrian carrying a smartphone
   equipped with a network device for wireless communication (e.g.,
   WiFi) with an IP-RSU.  Vehicles and pedestrians can also communicate
   with each other via an IP-RSU.  An edge computing device behind the
   IP-RSU can collect the mobility information from vehicles and
   pedestrians, compute wireless communication scheduling for the sake
   of them.  This scheduling can save the battery of each pedestrian's
   smartphone by allowing it to work in sleeping mode before the
   communication with vehicles, considering their mobility.

   For Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), a vehicle can directly communicate
   with a pedestrian's smartphone by V2X without IP-RSU relaying.
   Light-weight mobile nodes such as bicycles may also communicate
   directly with a vehicle for collision avoidance using V2V.

   To support the applications of these V2X use cases, the functions of
   IPv6 such as VND, VMM, and VSP are prerequisite for the IPv6-based
   packet exchange, the transport-layer session continuity, and the
   secure, safe communication between a vehicle and a pedestrian either
   directly or indirectly via an IP-RSU.

4.  Vehicular Networks

   This section describes an exemplary vehicular network architecture
   supporting V2V, V2I, and V2X communications in vehicular networks.
   It describes an internal network within a vehicle or an edge network
   (called EN).  It explains not only the internetworking between the
   internal networks of a vehicle and an EN via wireless links, but also
   the internetworking between the internal networks of two vehicles via
   wireless links.

4.1.  Vehicular Network Architecture

   Figure 1 shows an exemplary vehicular network architecture for V2I
   and V2V in a road network.  The vehicular network architecture
   contains vehicles, IP-RSUs, Vehicular Cloud, Traffic Control Center,
   and Mobility Anchor as components.  However, some components in the
   vehicular network architecture may not be needed for vehicular
   networks, such as Vehicular Cloud, Traffic Control Center, and
   Mobility Anchor.

   As shown in this figure, IP-RSUs as routers and vehicles with IP-OBU
   have wireless media interfaces for VANET.  Furthermore, the wireless
   media interfaces are autoconfigured with a global IPv6 prefix (e.g.,
   2001:DB8:1:1::/64) to support both V2V and V2I networking.  Note that
   2001:DB8::/32 is a documentation prefix [RFC3849] for example
   prefixes in this document, and also that any routable IPv6 address
   needs to be routable in a VANET and a vehicular network including IP-
   RSUs.

   For IPv6 packets transported over IEEE 802.11-OCB, [RFC8691]
   specifies several details, including Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU),
   frame format, link-local address, address mapping for unicast and
   multicast, stateless autoconfiguration, and subnet structure.  An
   Ethernet Adaptation (EA) layer is in charge of transforming some
   parameters between IEEE 802.11 MAC layer and IPv6 network layer,
   which is located between IEEE 802.11-OCB's logical link control layer
   and IPv6 network layer.  This IPv6 over 802.11-OCB can be used for
   both V2V and V2I in IPv6-based vehicular networks.

   In Figure 1, three IP-RSUs (IP-RSU1, IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3) are
   deployed in the road network and are connected with each other
   through the wired networks (e.g., Ethernet), which are part of a
   Vehicular Cloud.  A Traffic Control Center (TCC) is connected to the
   Vehicular Cloud for the management of IP-RSUs and vehicles in the
   road network.  A Mobility Anchor (MA) may be located in the TCC as a
   mobility management controller, which is a controller for the
   mobility management of vehicles.  Vehicle2, Vehicle3, and Vehicle4
   are wirelessly connected to IP-RSU1, IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3,
   respectively.  The three wireless networks of IP-RSU1, IP-RSU2, and
   IP-RSU3 can belong to three different subnets (i.e., Subnet1,
   Subnet2, and Subnet3), respectively.  Those three subnets use three
   different prefixes (i.e., Prefix1, Prefix2, and Prefix3).

   A single subnet prefix can span multiple vehicles in VANET.  For
   example, in Figure 1, for Prefix 1, three vehicles (i.e., Vehicle1,
   Vehicle2, and Vehicle5) can construct a connected VANET.  Also, for
   Prefix 2, two vehicles (i.e., Vehicle3 and Vehicle6) can construct
   another connected VANET, and for Prefix 3, two vehicles (i.e.,
   Vehicle4 and Vehicle7) can construct another connected VANET.

   In wireless subnets in vehicular networks (e.g., Subnet1 and Subnet2
   in Figure 1), vehicles can construct a connected VANET (with an
   arbitrary graph topology) and can communicate with each other via V2V
   communication.  Vehicle1 can communicate with Vehicle2 via V2V
   communication, and Vehicle2 can communicate with Vehicle3 via V2V
   communication because they are within the wireless communication
   range for each other.  On the other hand, Vehicle3 can communicate
   with Vehicle4 via the vehicular infrastructure (i.e., IP-RSU2 and IP-

   RSU3) by employing V2I (i.e., V2I2V) communication because they are
   not within the wireless communication range for each other.

   An IPv6 mobility solution is needed in vehicular networks so that a
   vehicle's TCP session can be continued while it moves from an IP-
   RSU's wireless coverage to another IP-RSU's wireless coverage.  In
   Figure 1, assuming that Vehicle2 has a TCP session with a
   corresponding node in the vehicular cloud, Vehicle2 can move from IP-
   RSU1's wireless coverage to IP-RSU2's wireless coverage.  In this
   case, a handover for Vehicle2 needs to be performed by either a host-
   based mobility management scheme (e.g., MIPv6 [RFC6275]) or a
   network-based mobility management scheme (e.g., PMIPv6 [RFC5213]).
   In the host-based mobility scheme, an IP-RSU plays a role of a home
   agent in a visited network.  On the other hand, in the network-based
   mobility scheme, an MA plays a role of a mobility management
   controller such as a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in PMIPv6, and an
   IP-RSU plays a role of an access router such as a Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) in PMIPv6 [RFC5213].

   In vehicular networks, the control plane can be separated from the
   data plane for efficient mobility management and data forwarding.
   The separation of the control plane and data plane can be performed
   by the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) [RFC7149].  An MA can
   configure and monitor its IP-RSUs and vehicles for mobility
   management, location management, and security services in an
   efficient way.

   The mobility information of a GPS receiver mounted in its vehicle
   (e.g., position, speed, and direction) can be used to accommodate
   mobility-aware proactive handover schemes, which can perform the
   handover of a vehicle according to its mobility and the wireless
   signal strength of a vehicle and an IP-RSU in a proactive way.

   Vehicles can use the TCC as their Home Network having a home agent
   for mobility management as in MIPv6 [RFC6275] and PMIPv6 [RFC5213],
   so the TCC maintains the mobility information of vehicles for
   location management.  IP tunneling over the wireless link should be
   avoided for performance efficiency.  Also, in vehicular networks,
   asymmetric links sometimes exist and must be considered for wireless
   communications such as V2V and V2I.

4.2.  V2I-based Internetworking

   This section discusses the internetworking between a vehicle's
   internal network (i.e., moving network) and an EN's internal network
   (i.e., fixed network) via V2I communication.  Note that an EN can
   accommodate multiple routers (or switches) and servers (e.g., ECDs,
   navigation server, and DNS server) in its internal network.

   A vehicle's internal network often uses Ethernet to interconnect
   Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the vehicle.  The internal network
   can support WiFi and Bluetooth to accommodate a driver's and
   passenger's mobile devices (e.g., smartphone or tablet).  The network
   topology and subnetting depend on each vendor's network configuration
   for a vehicle and an EN.  It is reasonable to consider the
   interaction between the internal network and an external network
   within another vehicle or an EN.

   As shown in Figure 2, as internal networks, a vehicle's moving
   network and an EN's fixed network are self-contained networks having
   multiple subnets and having an edge router (e.g., IP-OBU and IP-RSU)
   for the communication with another vehicle or another EN.
   Internetworking between two internal networks via V2I communication
   requires the exchange of the network parameters and the network
   prefixes of the internal networks.

   Figure 2 also shows internetworking between the vehicle's moving
   network and the EN's fixed network.  There exists an internal network
   (Moving Network1) inside Vehicle1.  Vehicle1 has two hosts (Host1 and
   Host2), and two routers (IP-OBU1 and Router1).  There exists another
   internal network (Fixed Network1) inside EN1.  EN1 has one host
   (Host3), two routers (IP-RSU1 and Router2), and the collection of
   servers (Server1 to ServerN) for various services in the road
   networks, such as the emergency notification and navigation.
   Vehicle1's IP-OBU1 (as a mobile router) and EN1's IP-RSU1 (as a fixed
   router) use 2001:DB8:1:1::/64 for an external link (e.g., DSRC) for
   V2I networking.  Thus, a host (Host1) in Vehicle1 can communicate
   with a server (Server1) in EN1 for a vehicular service through
   Vehicle1's moving network, a wireless link between IP-OBU1 and IP-
   RSU1, and EN1's fixed network.

   For an IPv6 communication between an IP-OBU and an IP-RSU or between
   two neighboring IP-OBUs, network parameters need to be shared among
   them, such as MAC layer and IPv6 layer information.  The MAC layer
   information includes wireless link layer parameters, transmission
   power level, the MAC address of an external network interface for the
   internetworking with another IP-OBU or IP-RSU.  The IPv6 layer
   information includes the IPv6 address and network prefix of an
   external network interface for the internetworking with another IP-
   OBU or IP-RSU.

   Through the exchange of network parameters and network prefixes among
   internal networks, packets can be transmitted between the vehicle's
   moving network and the EN's fixed network.  Thus, V2I requires an
   efficient exchange protocol for network parameters and an efficient
   routing protocol for network prefixes.

   This section discusses the internetworking between the moving
   networks of two neighboring vehicles via V2V communication.

   Figure 3 shows internetworking between the moving networks of two
   neighboring vehicles.  There exists an internal network (Moving
   Network1) inside Vehicle1.  Vehicle1 has two hosts (Host1 and Host2),
   and two routers (IP-OBU1 and Router1).  There exists another internal

   (Host3 and Host4), and two routers (IP-OBU2 and Router2).  Vehicle1's
   IP-OBU1 (as a mobile router) and Vehicle2's IP-OBU2 (as a mobile
   router) use 2001:DB8:1:1::/64 for an external link (e.g., DSRC) for
   V2V networking.  Thus, a host (Host1) in Vehicle1 can communicate
   with another host (Host3) in Vehicle2 for a vehicular service through
   Vehicle1's moving network, a wireless link between IP-OBU1 and IP-
   OBU2, and Vehicle2's moving network.

   Figure 4 shows multihop internetworking between the moving networks

   can communicate with Host3 in Vehicle3 via IP-OBU1 in Vehicle1, IP-
   OBU2 in Vehicle2, and IP-OBU3 in Vehicle3 in a linear topology as
   shown in the figure.

5.  Problem Statement

   In order to specify protocols using the abovementioned architecture
   for VANETs, IPv6 core protocols have to be adapted to overcome
   certain challenging aspects of vehicular networking.  Since the
   vehicles are likely to be moving at great speed, protocol exchanges
   need to be completed in a time relatively small compared to the
   lifetime of a link between a vehicle and an IP-RSU, or between two
   vehicles.  This has a major impact on IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND).
   Mobility Management (MM) is also vulnerable to disconnections that
   occur before the completion of identity verification and tunnel
   management.  This is especially true given the unreliable nature of
   wireless communications.  Thus, this section presents key topics such
   as neighbor discovery and mobility management.

5.1.  Neighbor Discovery

   IPv6 ND [RFC4861][RFC4862] is a core part of the IPv6 protocol suite.
   IPv6 ND is designed for point-to-point links and transit links (e.g.,
   Ethernet).  It assumes an efficient and reliable support of multicast
   from the link layer for various network operations such as MAC
   Address Resolution (AR) and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).

   Vehicles move quickly within the communication coverage of any
   particular vehicle or IP-RSU.  Before the vehicles can exchange
   application messages with each other, they need to be configured with
   a link-local IPv6 address or a global IPv6 address, and run IPv6 ND.

   The legacy DAD assumes that a node with an IPv6 address can reach any
   other node with the scope of its address at the time it claims its
   address, and can hear any future claim for that address by another
   party within the scope of its address for the duration of the address
   ownership.  However, the partitioning and merging of VANETs makes
   this assumption frequently invalid in vehicular networks.  The
   merging and partitioning of VANETs occurs frequently in vehicular
   networks.  This merging and partitioning should be considered for the
   IPv6 ND such as IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   [RFC4862].  Due to the merging of VANETs, two IPv6 addresses may
   conflict with each other though they were unique before the merging.
   Also, the partitioning of a VANET may make vehicles with the same
   prefix be physically unreachable.  Also, SLAAC needs to prevent IPv6
   address duplication due to the merging of VANETs.  According to the
   merging and partitioning, a destination vehicle (as an IPv6 host)
   needs to be distinguished as either an on-link host or an off-link
   host even though the source vehicle uses the same prefix with the
   destination vehicle.

   To efficiently prevent the IPv6 address duplication due to the VANET
   partitioning and merging from happing in vehicular networks, the
   vehicular networks need to support a vehicular-network-wide DAD by
   defining a scope that is compatible with the legacy DAD.  In this
   case, two vehicles can communicate with each other when there exists
   a communication path over VANET or a combination of VANETs and IP-
   RSUs, as shown in Figure 1.  By using the vehicular-network-wide DAD,
   vehicles can assure that their IPv6 addresses are unique in the
   vehicular network whenever they are connected to the vehicular
   infrastructure or become disconnected from it in the form of VANET.

   ND time-related parameters such as router lifetime and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) interval need to be adjusted for high-speed
   vehicles and vehicle density.  As vehicles move faster, the NA
   interval should decrease (e.g., from 1 sec to 0.5 sec) for the NA
   messages to reach the neighboring vehicles promptly.  Also, as
   vehicle density is higher, the NA interval should increase (e.g.,
   from 0.5 sec to 1 sec) for the NA messages to reduce collision
   probability with other NA messages.

   For IPv6-based safety applications (e.g., context-aware navigation,
   adaptive cruise control, and platooning) in vehicular networks, the
   delay-bounded data delivery is critical.  Implementations for such

   applications are not available yet.  IPv6 ND needs to efficiently
   work to support IPv6-based safety applications.

5.1.1.  Link Model

   A prefix model for a vehicular network needs to facilitate the
   communication between two vehicles with the same prefix regardless of
   the vehicular network topology as long as there exist bidirectional
   E2E paths between them in the vehicular network including VANETs and
   IP-RSUs.  This prefix model allows vehicles with the same prefix to
   communicate with each other via a combination of multihop V2V and
   multihop V2I with VANETs and IP-RSUs.

   IPv6 protocols work under certain assumptions for the link model that
   do not necessarily hold in a vehicular wireless link
   [VIP-WAVE][RFC5889].  For instance, some IPv6 protocols assume
   symmetry in the connectivity among neighboring interfaces [RFC6250].
   However, radio interference and different levels of transmission
   power may cause asymmetric links to appear in vehicular wireless
   links.  As a result, a new vehicular link model needs to consider the
   asymmetry of dynamically changing vehicular wireless links.

   There is a relationship between a link and a prefix, besides the
   different scopes that are expected from the link-local and global
   types of IPv6 addresses.  In an IPv6 link, it is assumed that all
   interfaces which are configured with the same subnet prefix and with
   on-link bit set can communicate with each other on an IPv6 link.
   However, the vehicular link model needs to define the relationship
   between a link and a prefix, considering the dynamics of wireless
   links and the characteristics of VANET.

   A VANET can have multiple links between pairs of vehicles within
   wireless communication range, as shown in Figure 4.  When two
   vehicles belong to the same VANET, but they are out of wireless
   communication range, they cannot communicate directly with each
   other.  Suppose that a global-scope IPv6 prefix is assigned to VANETs
   in vehicular networks.  Even though two vehicles in the same VANET
   configure their IPv6 addresses with the same IPv6 prefix, they may
   not communicate with each other not in a one hop in the same VANET
   because of the multihop network connectivity between them.  Thus, in
   this case, the concept of an on-link IPv6 prefix does not hold
   because two vehicles with the same on-link IPv6 prefix cannot
   communicate directly with each other.  Also, when two vehicles are
   located in two different VANETs with the same IPv6 prefix, they
   cannot communicate with each other.  When these two VANETs converge
   to one VANET, the two vehicles can communicate with each other in a
   multihop fashion, for example, wheh they are Vehicle1 and Vehicle3,
   as shown in Figure 4.



Jeong, Ed.                Expires July 9, 2020                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


   From the previous observation, a vehicular link model should consider
   the frequent partitioning and merging of VANETs due to vehicle
   mobility.  Therefore, the vehicular link model needs to use an on-
   link prefix and off-link prefix according to the network topology of
   vehicles such as a one-hop reachable network and a multihop reachable
   network (or partitioned networks).  If the vehicles with the same
   prefix are reachable with each other in one hop, the prefix should be
   on-link.  On the other hand, if some of the vehicles with the same
   prefix are not reachable with each other in one hop due to either the
   multihop topology in the VANET or multiple partitions, the prefix
   should be off-link.

   The vehicular link model needs to support the multihop routing in a
   connected VANET where the vehicles with the same global-scope IPv6
   prefix are connected in one hop or multiple hops.  It also needs to
   support the multihop routing in multiple connected VANETs through
   infrastructure nodes (e.g., IP-RSU) where they are connected to the
   infrastructure.  For example, in Figure 1, suppose that Vehicle1,
   Vehicle2, and Vehicle3 are configured with their IPv6 addresses based
   on the same global-scope IPv6 prefix.  Vehicle1 and Vehicle3 can also
   communicate with each other via either multihop V2V or multihop
   V2I2V.  When the two vehicles of Vehicle1 and Vehicle3 are connected
   in a VANET, it will be more efficient for them to directly
   communicate with each other via VANET rather than indirectly via IP-
   RSUs.  On the other hand, when the two vehicles of Vehicle1 and
   Vehicle3 are far away from the communication range in separate VANETs
   and under two different IP-RSUs, they can communicate with each other
   through the relay of IP-RSUs via V2I2V.  Thus, two separate VANETs
   can merge into one network via IP-RSU(s).  Also, newly arriving
   vehicles can merge two separate VANETs into one VANET if they can
   play a role of a relay node for those VANETs.

5.1.2.  MAC Address Pseudonym

   For the protection of drivers' privacy, a pseudonym of a MAC address
   of a vehicle's network interface should be used, so that the MAC
   address can be changed periodically.  However, although such a
   pseudonym of a MAC address can protect some extent of privacy of a
   vehicle, it may not be able to resist attacks on vehicle
   identification by other fingerprint information, for example, the
   scrambler seed embedded in IEEE 802.11-OCB frames [Scrambler-Attack].
   The pseudonym of a MAC address affects an IPv6 address based on the
   MAC address, and a transport-layer (e.g., TCP and and SCTP) session
   with an IPv6 address pair.  However, the pseudonym handling is not
   implemented and tested yet for applications on IP-based vehicular
   networking.





Jeong, Ed.                Expires July 9, 2020                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


   In the ETSI standards, for the sake of security and privacy, an ITS
   station (e.g., vehicle) can use pseudonyms for its network interface
   identities (e.g., MAC address) and the corresponding IPv6 addresses
   [Identity-Management].  Whenever the network interface identifier
   changes, the IPv6 address based on the network interface identifier
   needs to be updated, and the uniqueness of the address needs to be
   checked through the DAD procedure.  For vehicular networks with high
   mobility and density, this DAD needs to be performed efficiently with
   minimum overhead so that the vehicles can exchange application
   messages (e.g., collision avoidance and accident notification) with
   each other with a short interval (e.g., 0.5 second)
   [NHTSA-ACAS-Report].

5.1.3.  Routing

   For multihop V2V communications in either a VANET or VANETs via IP-
   RSUs, a vehicular ad hoc routing protocol (e.g., AODV and OLSRv2) may
   be required to support both unicast and multicast in the links of the
   subnet with the same IPv6 prefix.  However, it will be costly to run
   both vehicular ND and a vehicular ad hoc routing protocol in terms of
   control traffic overhead [ID-Multicast-Problems].

   A routing protocol for VANET may cause redundant wireless frames in
   the air to check the neighborhood of each vehicle and compute the
   routing information in VANET with a dynamic network topology because
   the IPv6 ND is used to check the neighborhood of each vehicle.  Thus,
   the vehicular routing needs to take advantage of the IPv6 ND to
   minimize its control overhead.

5.2.  Mobility Management

   The seamless connectivity and timely data exchange between two end
   points requires an efficient mobility management including location
   management and handover.  Most of vehicles are equipped with a GPS
   receiver as part of a dedicated navigation system or a corresponding
   smartphone App.  Note that The GPS receiver may not provide vehicles
   with accurate location information in adverse environments such as a
   building area and tunnel.  The location precision can be improved by
   the assistance from the IP-RSUs or a cellular system with a GPS
   receiver for location information.

   With a GPS navigator, an efficient mobility management can be
   performed with the help of vehicles periodically reporting their
   current position and trajectory (i.e., navigation path) to the
   vehicular infrastructure (having IP-RSUs and an MA in TCC).  This
   vehicular infrastructure can predict the future positions of the
   vehicles with their mobility information (i.e., the current position,
   speed, direction, and trajectory) for the efficient mobility



Jeong, Ed.                Expires July 9, 2020                 [Page 20]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


   management (e.g., proactive handover).  For a better proactive
   handover, link-layer parameters, such as the signal strength of a
   link-layer frame (e.g., Received Channel Power Indicator (RCPI)
   [VIP-WAVE]), can be used to determine the moment of a handover
   between IP-RSUs along with mobility information.

   By predicting a vehicle's mobility, the vehicular infrastructure
   needs to better support IP-RSUs to perform efficient SLAAC, data
   forwarding, horizontal handover (i.e., handover in wireless links
   using a homogeneous radio technology), and vertical handover (i.e.,
   handover in wireless links using heterogeneous radio technologies) in
   advance along with the movement of the vehicle.

   For example, as shown in Figure 1, when a vehicle (e.g., Vehicle2) is
   moving from the coverage of an IP-RSU (e.g., IP-RSU1) into the
   coverage of another IP-RSU (e.g., IP-RSU2) belonging to a different
   subnet, the IP-RSUs can proactively support the IPv6 mobility of the
   vehicle, while performing the SLAAC, data forwarding, and handover
   for the sake of the vehicle.

   Therefore, for the proactive and seamless IPv6 mobility of vehicles,
   the vehicular infrastructure (including IP-RSUs and MA) needs to
   efficiently perform the mobility management of the vehicles with
   their mobility information and link-layer information.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security and privacy for IPv6-based vehicular
   networking.  The security and privacy is one of key components in
   IPv6-based vehicular networking along with neighbor discovery and
   mobility management.

   Security and privacy are paramount in the V2I, V2V, and V2X
   networking.  Only authorized vehicles need to be allowed to use the
   vehicular networking.  Also, in-vehicle devices (e.g., ECU) and
   mobile devices (e.g., smartphone) in a vehicle need to communicate
   with other in-vehicle devices and mobile devices in another vehicle,
   and other servers in an IP-RSU in a secure way.  Even a perfectly
   authorized and legitimate vehicle may be hacked to run malicious
   applications to track and collect its and other vehicles'
   information.  For this case, an attack mitigation process may be
   required to reduce the aftermath of the malicious behaviors.

   Strong security measures shall protect vehicles roaming in road
   networks from the attacks of malicious nodes, which are controlled by
   hackers.  For safety applications, the cooperation among vehicles is
   assumed.  Malicious nodes may disseminate wrong driving information
   (e.g., location, speed, and direction) to make driving be unsafe.



Jeong, Ed.                Expires July 9, 2020                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement            January 2020


   For example, Sybil attack, which tries to confuse a vehicle with
   multiple false identities, disturbs a vehicle in taking a safe
   maneuver.  This sybil attack needs to be prevented through the
   cooperation between good vehicles and IP-RSUs.  Note that good
   vehicles are ones with valid certificates that are determined by the
   authentication process with an authentication server in the vehicular
   cloud.  However, applications on IPv6-based vehicular networking,
   which are resilient to such a sybil attack, are not developed and
   tested yet.

   To identify the genuineness of vehicles against malicious vehicles,
   an authentication method is required.  A Vehicle Identification
   Number (VIN) and a user certificate along with in-vehicle device's
   identifier generation can be used to efficiently authenticate a
   vehicle or a user through a road infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU)
   connected to an authentication server in the vehicular cloud.  Also,
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates can be used for the
   vehicle authentication to allow secure E2E vehicle communications.
   To identify the genuineness of vehicles against malicious vehicles,
   an authentication method is required.  For vehicle authentication,
   information available from a vehicle or a driver (e.g., Vehicle
   Identification Number (VIN) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   certificate [RFC8446]) needs to be used to efficiently authenticate a
   vehicle or a user with the help of a road infrastructure node (e.g.,
   IP-RSU) connected to an authentication server in the vehicular cloud.

   For secure V2I communication, a secure channel between a mobile
   router (i.e., IP-OBU) in a vehicle and a fixed router (i.e., IP-RSU)
   in an EN needs to be established, as shown in Figure 2.  Also, for
   secure V2V communication, a secure channel between a mobile router
   (i.e., IP-OBU) in a vehicle and a mobile router (i.e., IP-OBU) in
   another vehicle needs to be established, as shown in Figure 3.

   To prevent an adversary from tracking a vehicle with its MAC address
   or IPv6 address, MAC address pseudonym needs to be provided to the
   vehicle; that is, each vehicle periodically updates its MAC address
   and the corresponding IPv6 address [RFC4086][RFC4941].  Such an
   update of the MAC and IPv6 addresses should not interrupt the E2E
   communications between two vehicles (or between a vehicle and an IP-
   RSU) for a long-living transport-layer session.  However, if this
   pseudonym is performed without strong E2E confidentiality, there will
   be no privacy benefit from changing MAC and IPv6 addresses, because
   an adversary can observe the change of the MAC and IPv6 addresses and
   track the vehicle with those addresses.

   For the IPv6 ND, the DAD is required for the uniqueness of the IPv6
   address of a vehicle's wireless interface.  This DAD can be used as a
   flooding attack that makes the DAD-related ND packets are



Jeong, Ed.                Expires July 9, 2020                 [Page 22]

   disseminated over the VANET or vehicular networks.  Thus, the
   vehicles and IP-RSUs need to filter out suspicious ND traffic in
   advance.

   For the mobility management, a malicious vehicle can construct
   multiple virtual bogus vehicles, and register them with IP-RSUs and
   MA.  This registration makes the IP-RSUs and MA waste their
   resources.  The IP-RSUs and MA need to determine whether a vehicle is
   genuine or bogus in the mobility management.  Also, the
   confidentiality of control packets and data packets among IP-RSUs and
   MA, the E2E paths (e.g., tunnels) need to be protected by secure
   communication channels.  In addition, to prevent bogus IP-RSUs and MA
   from interfering IPv6 mobility of vehicles, the mutual authentication
   among them needs to be performed by certificates (e.g., TLS
   certificate).

Appendix A.  Changes from draft-ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking-12

   The following changes are made from draft-ietf-ipwave-vehicular-
   networking-12:

   o  This version is revised based on the comments from Carlos
      Bernardos.

   o  This version focuses on problems rather than solutions for IPWAVE.
      Also, this version addresses the requirements of IPv6 neighbor
      discovery, mobility management, and security and privacy.

   o  In Section 2, IP-OBU and IP-RSU are used instead of OBU and RSU,
      respectively.

   o  In Section 4.1, an exemplary vehicular network architecture is
      illustrated for the problem statement as Figure 1.
