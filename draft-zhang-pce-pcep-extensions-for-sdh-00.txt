1. Introduction 
    
   RFC4655 defines the PCE based architecture and explains how a PCE may 
   compute LSPs in MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS) networks at 
   the request of Path Computation Clients (PCCs).

   RFC5440 specifies the PCEP for communication between a PCC and a PCE, 
   or between two PCEs, in compliance with RFC4657. However, that 
   specification does not provide a mechanism to request path 
   computation for establishing TE LSPs in SDH network. [GMPLS-REQ] 
   addresses the functional requirements for GMPLS in PCE application. 

   This document describes the protocol extensions to PCEP to support 
   path computation for SDH networks. 

1.1. Requirements Language 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. 

2. Terminology 

   The following terminology is used in this document. 

   PCC:  Path Computation Client. Any client application requesting a 
      path computation to be performed by the Path Computation Element. 

   PCE:  Path Computation Element. An entity (component, application, or 
      network node) that is capable of computing a network path or 
      route based on a network graph and applying computational 
      constraints. 

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol. PCEP is a 
      request/response protocol used for the communication between a 
      PCC and a PCE, or between two PCEs. 

   PCEP Peer:  An element involved in a PCEP session (For example, a PCC 
      or a PCE). 

   PCEP Session:  The PCEP session is a logical connection established 
      automatically between the PCEP peers. 

   This document also uses the terminology defined in RFC4655, and 
   RFC5440. 

3. Requirements 

   This section summarizes the PCEP extensions for GMPLS requirements 
   specific to SDH networks. This document introduces no new messages 
   for PCEP. However, extensions have been introduced to the existing 
   PCEP objects, sub-objects and TLVs. Also, few new objects and TLVs

   have been introduced to support SDH. The details on the PCEP objects 
   and TLVs are mentioned below: 

   Enhanced Objects 

       o  PCEP RP Object 
       o  PCEP End Point (IPv4/Node ID) Object 

   Newly Introduced Object 

      o  PCEP QoS Object 

   Newly Introduced TLVs 

       o  Requested GMPLS Label 
       o  Destination Prefix Information 
       o  SONET/SDH QoS Parameters 
       o  LSP Protection Information 

4. Protocol Procedure and Extensions 

4.1. RP Object Extension 

   The PCE architecture can be extended to support various network types 
   such as SDH, WDM, OTN, PTN and so on. The application-specific PCEP 
   requirements and protocol enhancements varies from network to network. 
   PCE MAY select the appropriate policy profile depending on the 
   current path request which is applicable to a particular network type. 

   The PCC can specify its network type in the RP object of the PCEP 
   protocol. The RP (Request Parameters) object MUST be carried within 
   each PCReq and PCRep messages and MAY be carried within PCNtf and 
   PCErr messages. The RP object can handle the requests and responses 
   of various network types for the computation of TE LSPs. 

   The RP object can also specify the next hop information. The simple 
   routing implementation can perform route look-up using the 
   destination IP address ignoring the additional information contained 
   in the request. More sophisticated routing implementations can use 
   additional information contained in the request to influence route 
   selection. This additional information includes resource class, input 
   network interface, traffic and service parameters. 

   The modified RP object carrying the additional information is as 
   follows:

   NT - Network Type (3-bits). This field denotes the network type. 

           Bit                    NT Type 

           000        DC: Data Communication Networks (default)

           111       Multi-layered path request 

   The RP object carrying bits ranging from 101 to 110 in the NT flag 
   must be ignored. In future these bits can be used to represent new 
   network types. 

4.1.1. Requested GMPLS Label Information 

   The Requested GMPLS Label Information TLV is a new OPTIONAL TLV and 
   MUST only appear inside RP object. The receiver SHOULD ignore the TLV 
   if it appears in any other object other than RP object. This TLV will 
   appear only when the resources required are requested using 
   generalized label. If multiple instance of this TLV is present, the 
   receiver SHOULD accept the first instance and SHOULD ignore the rest. 

   The format of Requested GMPLS Label Information TLV is as follows:

   Type (16-bits) - Specifies the type of the TLV (Value = 13). 

   Length (16-bits) - Specifies the length of the value field (Value = 
   4). 

   Encoding Type (8-bits) - Specifies the encoding type of the LSP being 
   requested. 

   The details of Encoding type is discussed in RFC 3471. 

   Switching Type (8-bits) - Specifies the switching type requested by 
   the LSP. 

   The details of Switching type is discussed in RFC 3471. 

   Carried Payload ID (16-bits) - Specifies the ID of the payload 
   carried by the LSP. 

4.2. No-PATH Object Extension 

   The NO-PATH object is used in PCRep messages in response to an 
   unsuccessful path computation request (the PCE could not find a path 
   by satisfying the set of constraints). In this scenario, PCE MUST 
   include a NO-PATH object in the PCRep message. 

   The N0-PATH object carries the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV that specifies more 
   information on the reasons that led to a negative reply. In case of 
   SDH networks there could be some more additional constraints that led 
   to the failure like protection mismatch, lack of resources, and so on. 
   Few new flags have been introduced in 32-bit flag field of the NO-
   PATH-VECTOR TLV and no modifications have been made in the NO-PATH 
   object. 

4.2.1. Extensions to NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV 

   The modified NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carrying the additional information 
   is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   New fields PM and NR are defined in the 28th and 27th bit of the 
   Flags field respectively. 

   PM - Protection Mismatch (1-bit). Specifies the mismatch of the 
   protection type in the request. 

   NR - No Resource (1-bit). Specifies that the resources are not 

   currently sufficient to provide the path. 

4.3. END-POINTS Object Extension 

   The END-POINTS object is used in a PCReq message to specify the 
   source IP address and the destination IP address of the path for 
   which a path computation is requested. New OPTIONAL TLVs are defined 
   that are to be carried in the END-POINTS object for the path that 
   depends on the previous hop address, destination prefix, and 
   additional interface information. 

4.3.1. Destination Prefix Information TLV 

   The Destination Prefix Information TLV is a new OPTIONAL TLV. It MUST 
   only appear inside END-POINTS (IPv4/Node ID) object. The receiver 
   SHOULD ignore the Destination Prefix Information TLV if it appears in 
   any other object other than END-POINTS object. This TLV contains the 
   prefix length for the destination IPv4 address and will appear when 
   prefix length is in the range between 0 and 32 (inclusive). 

   The format of the Destination Prefix Information TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Destination Prefix Length (8-bits) - Specifies the prefix length of 
   the destination IPv4 address. 

   Flags Field (7-bits) - Reserved for future to define new flags. It 
   MUST be filled with zeros and SHOULD be ignored by the receiver. 

   EM- Exact Prefix Match (1-bit) - Specifies whether exact prefix match 
   is required for the destination IPv4 address. 

      Bit                EM Type 

       0       Exact prefix match is not required 

       1       Exact prefix match is required 

   Reserved (16-bits) - Reserved. MUST be set to zero and SHOULD be 
   ignored by the receiver. 

4.4. New Object - QoS 

   When a PCC requests a PCE for a route, and if PCE provides the 
   response to the request, it MAY be useful for the PCC and the PCE to 
   include the traffic parameters. These traffic parameters specify a 
   base set of capabilities for SDH networks such as Service Level 
   Agreement (SLA), protection scheme, segment recovery, concatenation, 
   transparency, and so on. The QoS object handles the quality of 
   service parameters for TE-LSPs in SDH networks. 

   The QoS object can be included in the PCReq and PCRep messages by the 
   PCC and PCE respectively. It represents the parameters that become 
   necessary to manage bandwidth in the networks. When a PCE cannot find 
   a path by satisfying a set of constraints requested by the PCC, the 
   PCE may also include the original constraint so as to indicate the 
   reason for an unsuccessful computation in the NO-PATH object. Based 
   on the available service parameters proposed by a PCE, the PCC MAY 
   decide to resend the path requests. These parameters ensure that the 
   applications are guaranteed the network resources they need, despite 
   varying traffic load. 

   The format of the QoS object is as follows:

   Object Class (8-bits) - Specifies the class of the object (Value = 
   25). 

   OT - Object Type (4-bits) - Specifies the type of the object (Value = 
   1). 

   Object Length (16-bits) - Specifies the length of the object (Value = 
   16). 

   Res - Reserved (2-bits). It MUST be set to zero on transmission and 
   MUST be ignored on receipt. 

   P - Processing Rule (1-bit). The P flag allows a PCC to specify in a 
   PCReq message sent to a PCE whether the object must be taken into 
   account by the PCE during path computation or is just optional. When 
   the P flag is set, the object MUST be taken into account by the PCE. 
   Conversely, when the P flag is cleared, the object is optional and 
   the PCE can ignore it. 

   I - Ignore (1-bit). The I flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to 
   indicate to a PCC whether an optional object is processed or not. The 
   PCE MAY include the ignored optional object in its reply and set the 
   I flag to indicate that the optional object was ignored during path 
   computation. When the I flag is cleared, the PCE indicates that the 
   optional object was processed during the path computation. The 
   setting of the I flag for optional objects are purely indicative and 
   optional. The I flag has no meaning in a PCRep message when the P 
   flag has been set in the corresponding PCReq message. 

4.4.1. SDH-ASON QoS Parameters TLV 

   The SDH-ASON QoS Parameters TLV is a new OPTIONAL TLV. It MUST only 
   appear inside QoS object. The receiver SHOULD ignore the SDH-ASON QoS 
   Parameters TLV if it appears in any other object other than QoS 
   object. Only one instance of this TLV MUST be present inside QoS

   object. This TLV contains the parameters such as signal-type, 
   Requested Contiguous Concatenation (RCC), multiplier, Number of 
   Virtual Components (NVC), Number of Contiguous Concatenation (NCC), 
   transparency, and profile. 

   The format of the SDH-ASON QoS Parameters TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Type (16-bits) - Specifies the type of the TLV (Value = 34). 

   Length (16-bits) - Specifies the length of the value field (Value = 
   16). 

   ST - Signal Type (8-bits). Specifies the type of elementary signal 
   that comprises the requested LSP. Several transforms can be applied 
   successively on the elementary signal to build the final signal being 
   actually requested for the LSP. 

   Each transform application is optional and must be ignored if zero, 
   except the Multiplier (MT) that cannot be zero and is ignored if 
   equal to one. 

   Transforms must be applied strictly in the following order: 

   o  First, contiguous concatenation (by using the RCC and NCC fields) 
      can be optionally applied on the elementary signal, resulting in 
      a contiguously concatenated signal. 

   o  Second, virtual concatenation (by using the NVC field) can be 
      optionally applied on the elementary signal resulting in 
      virtually concatenated signal.

   o  Third, some transparency (by using the Transparency field) can be 
      optionally specified when requesting a frame as signal rather 
      than an SPE or VC based signal. 

   o  Fourth, a multiplication (by using the MT field) can be optionally 
      applied either directly on the elementary signal, or on the 
      contiguously concatenated signal obtained from the first phase, 
      or on the virtually concatenated signal obtained from the second 
      phase, or on these signals combined with some transparency. 

   The permitted values for SDH-ASON are as follows: 

      Bit       Type (Elementary Signal) 
       1        VT1.5  SPE / VC-11 
       2        VT2    SPE / VC-12 
       4        VT6    SPE / VC-2 
       5        STS-1  SPE / VC-3 
       6        STS-3c SPE / VC-4 
       7        STS-1      / STM-0 (only when requesting transparency) 
       8        STS-3      / STM-1 (only when requesting transparency) 
       9        STS-12     / STM-4 (only when requesting transparency) 
      10        STS-48     / STM-16(only when requesting transparency) 
      11        STS-192    / STM-64(only when requesting transparency) 
      12        STS-768    / STM-256(only when requesting transparency) 

   RCC - Requested Contiguous Concatenation (8 bits). This field is used 
   to request the optional SDH contiguous concatenation of the 
   elementary signal. This field is a vector of flags. Each flag 
   indicates the support of a particular type of contiguous 
   concatenation. Several flags can be set at the same time to indicate 
   a choice. 

   All the bits should be cleared if contiguous concatenation is not 
   requested. A non-zero field indicates that some contiguous 
   concatenation is requested. 

   NCC - Number of Contiguous Components (16 bits). Specifies the number 
   of identical SDH VCs (for example, elementary signal) that are 
   requested to be concatenated, as specified in the RCC field. 

   When requesting a transparent STS-N/STM-N signal limited to a single 
   contiguously concatenated STS-Nc_SPE/VC-4-Nc, the signal type must be 
   STS-N/STM-N, RCC with flag 1 and NCC set to 1. The NCC value must be 
   consistent with the type of contiguous concatenation being requested 
   in the RCC field. In particular, this field is irrelevant if no 
   contiguous concatenation is requested (RCC = 0), in that case it must 
   be set to zero when sent, and should be ignored when received. A RCC

   value different from 0 must imply a number of contiguous components 
   greater than 1. 

   NVC - Number of Virtual Components (16 bits). Specifies the number of 
   signals that are requested to be virtually concatenated. These 
   signals are all of the same type by definition. They are elementary 
   signal SPEs/VCs for which signal types are VT1.5_SPE/VC-11, VT2_SPE/ 
   VC-12, VT3_SPE, VT6_SPE/VC-2, STS-1_SPE/VC-3 or STS-3c_SPE/VC-4. 

   This field is set to 0 (default value) to indicate that no virtual 
   concatenation is requested. 

   MT - Multiplier (16 bits). Specifies the number of identical signals 
   that are requested for the LSP to form the final signal. These 
   signals can be either identical elementary signals, or identical 
   contiguous concatenated signals, or identical virtual concatenated 
   signals. Note that all these signals belong to the same LSP. 

   This field is set to one (default value) to indicate that exactly one 
   instance of a signal is being requested. 

   T - Transparency (32 bits). Specifies a vector of flags that 
   indicates the type of transparency being requested. Several flags can 
   be combined to provide different types of transparency. Not all 
   combinations are necessarily valid. The default value for this field 
   is zero, which means no transparency is requested. 

   Note as well that transparency is only applicable when using the 
   following signal types: STS-1/STM-0, STS-3/STM-1, STS-12/STM-4, STS- 
   48/STM-16, STS-192/STM-64 and STS-768/STM-256. At least one 
   transparency type must be specified when requesting such a signal 
   type. 

   The different transparency flags are the following: 

   o  Flag 1 (bit 1): Section/Regenerator Section layer 
   o  Flag 2 (bit 2): Line/Multiplex Section layer 

   Where bit 1 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved, they 
   should be set to zero when sent, and should be ignored when received. 
   A flag is set to one to indicate that the corresponding transparency 
   is requested. 

   P - Profile (32 bits). This field is intended to indicate particular 
   capabilities that must be supported for the LSP, for example 
   monitoring capabilities.

   No standard profile is currently defined and this field SHOULD be set 
   to zero when transmitted and SHOULD be ignored when received. In the 
   future TLV based extensions may be created. 

4.4.2. LSP Protection Information TLV 

   This is a new OPTIONAL TLV and MUST only appear inside QoS object. 
   This TLV contains the constraints related to protection which 
   includes SLA, protection scheme, segment recovery, and so on. 

   The format of the LSP Protection Information TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Length (16-bits) - Specifies the length of the value field (Value = 
   8). 

   Protection Flags 

   o  ET - Extra Traffic Flag (1-bit). Specifies the extra traffic flag. 
      It basically stands for the iron traffic that is preemptible. The 
      LSP should use links that are protecting other (primary) traffic. 
      Such LSPs may be preempted when the links carrying the (primary) 
      traffic fails. 

   o  UP - Unprotected Flag (1-bit).  Specifies the unprotected traffic, 
      copper. The LSP will not use any link layer protection. 

   o  SH - Shared Flag (1-bit).  Specifies the shared traffic, silver. A 
      shared link layer protection scheme, such as 1:N protection, 
      should be used to support the LSP. 

   o  DT - Dedicated 1:1 Flag (1-bit).  Specifies the dedicated 1:1 
      service, gold. A dedicated link layer protection scheme (1:1 
      protection) should be used to support the LSP.

   o  DP - Dedicated 1+1 Flag (1-bit).  Specifies the dedicated 1+1 
      service, diamond. A dedicated link layer protection scheme (1+1 
      protection) should be used to support the LSP. 

   o  LE - Link Enhanced Flag (1 bit).  Specifies the enhanced features 
      for a link, where a protection scheme that is more reliable than 
      dedicated 1+1 should be used, such as 4 fiber BLSR/MS-SPRING. 

   o  RR - Reroute Flag (1-bit).  Specifies the reroute flag. If set the 
      service is rerouted. 

   Reserved (18 bits) - Reserved for future. This field MUST be set to 
   zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt. 

   Additional Protection Flags 

   o  R - Required Flag (1-bit). 

   o  IP - In Place Flag (1-bit). 

   o  O - Operational Flag (1 bit).

   o  PS - Primary or Secondary Flag (1-bit).  Specifies whether to 
      signal and reserve the resources of the primary LSP (bit value = 
      0) or secondary LSP (bit value = 1). 

   Protection Scheme (8-bits) - Specifies the protection scheme of the 
   LSP. It can carry the following values based on the requested 
   protection type: 

       Value            Protection Scheme Type 

       0x00      No end-to-end protection (iron service) 

       0x01      Reroute protection (silver service) 

       0x02      1:1 protection without extra traffic (gold service)

   service. During re-routing or optimization, the traffic prevents the 
   route of the associated one. 

4.4.3. QoS Object in PCReq and PCRep 

   As mentioned earlier the QoS object MAY be included in the PCReq 
   message specifying the traffic parameters. This object is OPTIONAL, 
   and if present only one instance of SDH-ASON QoS parameters TLV or 
   LSP protection TLV must be included. If multiple instances of TLV or 
   some other TLV is present, then the complete message has to be 
   discarded without performing any further processing. 

   The format of the PCReq message including the QoS object is as 
   follows: 

   <PCReq Message> ::= <Common Header> 
                       [<svec-list>] 
                       <request-list>

          <metric-list> ::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>] 

4.5. Additional Error Type and Error Values Defined 

   A PCEP-ERROR object is used to report a PCEP error and is 
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error and 
   an Error-value that provides additional information about the error 
   type. An additional error type and few error values are defined to 
   represent some of the errors related to the newly identified objects 
   related to SDH networks. 

   For each PCEP error, an Error-Type and an Error-value are defined. 
   Error-Type 1 to 10 are already defined in RFC5440. Additional Error-
   values are defined for Error-Type 10 and a new Error-Type 14 is 
   introduced.

5. Manageability Considerations 

   Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

   This document makes no change to the basic operation of PCEP and so 
   there are no changes to the requirements for liveness detection and 
   monitoring set out in RFC4657 and RFC5440. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA assigns values to the PCEP protocol objects and TLVs. IANA is 
   requested to make some allocations for the newly defined objects and 
   TLVs introduced in this document. Also, IANA is requested to manage 
   the space of flags that are newly added in the TLVs. 

6.1. New PCEP Object 

   IANA is requested to make some allocations for the QoS object: 

   Object-Class Value         Name              Reference

7. Security Considerations 

   The protocol extensions defined in this document do not substantially 
   change the nature of PCEP. Therefore, the security considerations set 
   out in RFC5440 apply unchanged.
