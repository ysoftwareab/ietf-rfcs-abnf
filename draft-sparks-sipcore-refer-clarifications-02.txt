            Clarifications for the use of REFER with RFC6665
              draft-sparks-sipcore-refer-clarifications-02

Abstract

   An accepted SIP REFER method creates an implicit subscription using
   the SIP-Specific Event Notification Framework.  That framework was
   revised by RFC6665.  This document highlights the implications of the
   requirement changes in RFC6665, and updates the definition of the
   REFER method, RFC3515, to clarify and disambiguate the impact of
   those changes.

1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   An accepted SIP REFER method creates an implicit subscription using
   the SIP-Specific Event Notification Framework.  That framework was
   revised by [RFC6665].  This document highlights the implications of
   the requirement changes in RFC6665, and updates [RFC3515] to clarify
   and disambiguate the impact of those changes.

3.  Use of GRUU is mandatory

   Section 4.5.1 of [RFC6665] makes GRUU [RFC5627] mandatory to
   implement and use as the local target in the subscription created by
   the REFER request.

   A user agent constructing any REFER that can result in an implicit
   subscription MUST populate its Contact header field with a GRUU.

   As RFC6665 details, this is necessary to ensure that NOTIFY requests
   sent in the implicitly created subscription arrive at this user agent
   without creating a second usage inside an existing dialog.  Using the
   "norefersub" option tag [RFC4488] does not change this requirement,
   even if used in a "Require" header field.  Even if the recipient
   supports the "norefersub" mechanism, and accepts the request with the
   option tag in the "Require" header field, it is allowed to return a
   "Refer-Sub" header field with a value of "true" in the response, and
   create an implicit subscription.

   A UA that supports receiving REFER needs to include a GRUU as a
   Contact in INVITE requests to ensure out-of-dialog REFER requests
   related to this dialog arrive at this UA.

4.  Dialog reuse is prohibited

   As a direct consequence of requiring the use of GRUU, and the
   requirements in section 4.5.2 of RFC6665, sending a REFER that might
   result in an additional dialog usage within any existing dialog is
   prohibited.

   A user agent constructing a REFER request MUST built it as an out-of-
   dialog message as defined in [RFC3261].  Thus, the REFER request will
   have no tag parameter in its To: header field.

   A user agent wishing to identify an existing dialog (such as for call
   transfer as defined in [RFC5589] MUST use the "Target-Dialog"
   extension defined in [RFC4538] to do so.

   If a user agent can be certain that no implicit subscription will be
   created as a result of sending a REFER request (such as by requiring
   an extension that disallows any such subscription), the REFER request
   MAY be sent within an existing dialog.  Such a REFER will be
   constructed with its Contact header field populated with the dialog's
   Local URI as specified in section 12 of [RFC3261].

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations directly.
   The updated considerations in [RFC6665] apply to the implicit
   subscription created by an accepted REFER request.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
