   Abstract 
    
   Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings (NOMADv6) introduces a set of 
   extensions for MIPv6 protocol that allows for intelligent use of 
   multiple points of attachment simultaneously, on a mobile node.  It 
   specifies a set of rules (filters) communicated to binding agents 
   using binding updates. In turn, binding agents use this information 
   to determine whether and where to route flows associated with the 
   mobile node. In this manner, it is possible for a mobile node to

   distribute flows or packets of a flow among its available points of 
   attachment or to request that such flow is dropped before traversing 
   the Internet fabric, with or without notification to their source. 
   These extensions mirror a similar extension defined for Mobile IPv4 
   (NOMADv4) but has been extended to cater to the behavior of IPv6.

   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings        Oct 2005 
1.Introduction 
    
   This document extends Mobile IPv6 protocol, introducing a set of 
   rules (called filters) that are transmitted with binding updates by a 
   mobile node. When receiving the binding update with filters, a 
   binding agent (Mobile IPv6 entities that can maintain bindings, HA, 
   CN, MAP) forwards flows matching filters defined by a mobile node to 
   the point of attachment associated with the respective filter. In 
   this manner it is made possible for mobile nodes to use multiple 
   active points of attachment simultaneously and efficiently.  
     
   This draft defines a series of different filter modules that can be 
   used independently or combined to form complex filters. Such filters 
   are relayed to binding agents during binding updates and are included 
   in signaling as mobility options. Binding agents capable of 
   maintaining filters are called filtering agents. All filters 
   contained in a binding update are associated with the point of 
   attachment (care-of-address) indicated in the binding update. In this 
   manner, filtering agents become aware of the relationship between 
   certain flows and specific bindings.  
    
   Flows intercepted by, or originating from a Filtering Agent (HA, CN, 
   MAP) will be filtered and individual flows will be forwarded to the 
   are-of address indicated by the respective binding. This enables 
   mobile nodes to distribute flows or to distribute packets of a single 
   flow, among their available points of attachment. 
    
   Mobile IPv6 does not provide the facilities for a mobile node to 
   register multiple care-of-addresses for a single home IP address. 
   This functionality is important for the considerations presented in 
   this document. This draft introduces the `N´ bit to the binding 
   update message.  This bit, when set, informs the filtering agent to 
   hold multiple simultaneous binding for the given home address of the 
   mobile node and then manipulate the IP traffic based on the filtering 
   rules sent as mobility options. The benefits and goals of using 
   multiple points of attachment simultaneously are explained in [9], 
   [10] and [11], highlighting the benefits with real life scenarios.  
    
   The operation of filtering for Mobile IPv6 is intended to mirror the 
   operation of filtering for Mobile IPv4 [2], with changes necessary to 
   provide a similar behavior. The considerations presented in this 
   document are collectively referred to as the NOMADv6 Extensions.

            Mobile IPv6 signaling (binding update) with the purpose of  
            establishing a new mobility binding that contains one or  
            more Filter extensions as mobility options. Each Filtering

3.Comparison with Filters for Mobile IPv4 (NOMADv4 vs NOMADv6) 
    
   a. In MIPv6, there are no dedicated FAs, GFAs, or RFAs. The roles of 
   these entities have been taken over by the particular routers, which 
   are located along the path which a packet traverses from the HA to 
   the MN or CN to MN. These special routers are called MAPs. Therefore, 
   in an MIPv6 environment, MN destined packet filtering SHOULD be done 
   by an HA, CN or an MAP. 
    
   b. Mobile IPv6 route optimization can be deployed on a global scale 
   between all mobile nodes and correspondent nodes. Therefore, CNs are 
   considered along with Has as filtering agents. 
    
   d. MIPv6 lacks support for multiple simultaneous bindings that are 
   available in MIPv4 [6]. The filtering concept described in this draft 
   requires that all filtering agents are able to cater for simultaneous 
   bindings. For this a new N bit is introduced to the binding update 
   mobility header for the support of simultaneous bindings in NOMADv6. 
    
   e. Sub types of the Filter extensions are defined on the first byte 
   of the Data field in NOMADv6. NOMADv4 uses standard short and long 
   TLV format as defined in [6] for including sub types. 
    
    
4 NOMADv6 Protocol Overview 
    
   This section provides an overview of how filters for MIPv6 bindings 
   can be realized. 
    
4.1 Protocol Description 
    
 4.1.1 Multiple network interface support and N bit 
    
   Filters for Mobile IPv6 is applicable only in the context of a mobile 
   node maintaining multiple points of attachment to one or more 
   NOMADv6                Expires March 2006                         6 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings        Oct 2005 
   Internet administrative domains. NOMADv6 does not make any 
   assumptions on the number of permanent home IP addresses maintained 
   by a mobile node or the number of home agents related with each of 
   the home IP addresses. In that case, a point of attachment can be 
   associated with one or more home IP addresses and consequently reused 
   in different bindings with different binding agents.  
    
   The NOMADv6 reserves a bit in the Message Data field of the binding 
   update message, called the N bit, for the purpose of introducing 
   simultaneous bindings support. Upon receiving a binding update with 
   the N bit set, a filtering agent MUST issue a new binding for the 
   mobile node home IP address indicated in the binding update without 
   affecting any of the existing mobility bindings.  
    
   The format of the Message Data field in the binding update message is 
   as follows [3]:  
    
                                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                                  |Sequence #                     | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |A|H|L||K|N|     Reserved       |           Lifetime            | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   N    When set, the binding agent MUST act based on the functions 
        described in section 4.1.3 and add a new entry to the binding 
        cache without deleting any existing entries for the mobile 
        node´s home address which is specified in the home address 
        destination option. 
    
 4.1.2 Sending Filtering Rules 
    
   Mobile nodes that wish to associate Filters with an acquired care-of 
   address are required to issue a binding update including a list of 
   Filters that indicate which flows are associated with the registered 
   care-of-address. Such signaling is termed as Filtering Updates. A 
   Filter is consisted of one or more Filter Modules and is terminated 
   by a Filter Control Extension. A Filter Module may contain several 
   predicates. There is an OR relationship between predicates of a 
   Filter Module. Moreover, there is an AND relationship between Filter 
   Modules of the same Filter. Consequently, in order for a flow to 
   match a Filter, it is required to qualify for all of the Filter 
   Modules contained in the Filter.  
    
   With the help of the Filter Control Extension, the Filter´s purpose    
   can be defined. It contains the Filter´s Index, and a Weight field. 
   The Index identifies uniquely, a Filter for a given mobile node while 
   the Weight field indicates the relative amount of traffic for which 
   the filter is applicable. If the Weight field is set to zero, then 
   all matching flows will be dropped without notification to their 
   source.  
    
   A mobile node may define more than one Filter for a specific mobility 
   binding. The declaration of these Filters may take place during one 
   or more Filtering Updates. In the case of shared Filters, packets of 
   matching flows will get distributed between multiple points of 
   NOMADv6                Expires March 2006                         7 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings        Oct 2005 
   attachment with respect to the Weight value of each filter. A mobile 
   node may share a Filter between mobility bindings by issuing a 
   Filtering Request from each respective point of attachment. The first 
   one will contain the full Filter (Filter Body + Filter Control 
   Extension) while all subsequent Filtering Requests will contain only 
   a Filter Control Extension indicating the Index number of the Filter 
   to be shared.  
    
   Flows that fail to match any of the defined Filters are handled as 
   defined by the Filter with the lowest possible Index, termed  
   as Default Filter. A mobile node may define some of the attributes  
   of the Default Filter such as the associated mobility binding and  
   its Weight field by issuing a Filtering Request. Otherwise, these  
   will be configured by each Filtering Agent (see section 4.1.3).  
    
   When a mobile node needs to delete filters, it sends the binding 
   update containing a single Filter Control Extension. The index of the 
   filter to be deleted should be sent in the index field. If a mobile 
   node wishes to delete all filters, index should be set to 255. 
    
   All the filtering rules which have to be set in the mobility options 
   of a binding update will be described in section 7.1. The rules by 
   which a mobile node decides on the set of Filters are considered 
   beyond the scope of this document. The extensions presented in this 
   document do not affect in any way the mobile node´s choice on the 
   point of attachment to be used when returning traffic.  
    
    
 4.1.3 Processing at the Filtering Agent 
    
   Filtering Updates will be processed by one or more Filtering Agents.   
   A Filtering Agent can be any Mobile IPv6 entity that can maintain 
   mobility bindings with Filters, like a HA, CN or MAP.    
    
   Flows that fail to match any of the defined Filters are handled as  
   defined by the Default Filter. If a mobile node fails to promptly   
   define a Default Filter or if the associated mobility binding expires 
   then a new one will automatically be configured by each involved 
   Filtering Agent to the lowest possible Index of 0.  
    
   Different Filtering Agents may apply different Default Filter 
   definitions; however it is recommended that the Default Filter be   
   associated with the mobility binding with the longest outstanding   
   lifetime with the Weight field set to 1.  
    
   A mobile node may issue Filters corresponding to flows that do not    
   yet exist. When such a flow is initiated it will be handled by the    
   Filtering Agents as indicated by the respective Filter.  
    
   A Filtering Acknowledgement contains one or more extensions to the 
   binding acknowledgment indicating the Index of a Filter along with a 
   Code signifying the result of the respective Filtering Update. The 
   Code is used to relay success or the reason of rejection to the 
   mobile node.

   Upon receiving a binding update with the N bit not set, a Filtering 
   Agent should replace all existing bindings in its binding cache with 
   the one indicated by the binding update and remove all associated 
   bindings. From that point on the Filtering Agent is required to act 
   as per [3] and ignore the considerations presented in this document. 
   A mobility binding in that state is termed as an Idle Mobility 
   Binding.  
    
 4.1.4 Lifetime of a Filter 
    
   A Filter remains valid for the lifetime of the corresponding mobility 
   binding. If the lifetime of a binding expires or it is cancelled by 
   the registration of another mobility binding then all associated 
   Filters are deleted from the binding cache.  
    
   When renewing mobility binding, a mobile node is not required to 
   include any reference to any requested Filters. A mobile node SHOULD 
   set the N bit on in its Binding Update and then the Filtering Agent 
   SHOULD refresh the lifetime of the binding and all filters, related 
   to the home address sent on the Destination option of the Binding 
   Update.  
    
 4.1.6 Filters that split flows between different home addresses. 
    
   A mobile node that maintains multiple home IP addresses can share 
   multiple points of attachment between them. That is, having 
   established a binding for a certain home IP address and a specific 
   point of attachment does not restrict the use of the same point of 
   attachment with an other home IP address even when home IP addresses 
   share the same home agent. 
    
   A MN with more than one points of attachment, MAY have different home 
   addresses (multi-homed mobile node) for each of those points of 
   attachment. These addresses MAY be registered with different HAs or 
   with the same HA. In this situation, if MN wishes to split its flows 
   coming to one point of attachment (A) to another (B), MN MUST send a 
   Filtering Update via A, including an alternate CoA mobility option 
   with the CoA of the point of attachment B. The HA of the point of 
   attachment A, upon receival of this binding update, MUST tunnel the 
   matching flows to the CoA of the point of attachment B. (Refer Fig. 
   1) 
    
 4.1.7 De-registration when a single PoA is at the home network 
  
   When a mobile node is connected to its home network by one of its 
   points of attachment, the mobile node MUST de-register all the other 
   bindings that belong to the same home IP address. In this way, mobile 
   node SHOULD delete all filters associated with the specific 
   binding(s) and revert to operations as defined in [3]. 
    
4.2 Model of Operation 
    
   Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings has two modes of operation that can  
   be seamlessly combined but for the sake of simplicity are covered in    
   this section separately. The first model of operation concerns the  
   NOMADv6                Expires March 2006                         9 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings        Oct 2005 
   management of whole flows while the second model addresses the 
   distribution of the individual packets of flows between points of 
   attachment. 
    
   The distribution of multiple flows is illustrated in figure 1. It 
   shows a mobile node that maintains multiple access interfaces 
   simultaneously. Each interface provides a point of attachment through 
   a foreign network (FN-A, FN-B and FN-C). The extensions presented do 
   not provide any restriction as to how many points of attachment a 
   mobile node may maintain or how many home agents it can be attached 
   to. For example, the mobile node in figure 1 has two separate points 
   of attachment through FN-A and FN-B, communicating with CN-1 and CN-2 
   via HA-1. In addition, the mobile node maintains another point of 
   attachment through FN-C, corresponding with CN3 via HA2. MN uses one 
   home address (HoA-1) for two interfaces, while the other interface is 
   connected to the HA2 via HoA-2.  
    
   In figure 1, the mobile node maintains five communication sessions 
   with correspondent nodes of CN1, CN2 and CN3. Flows associated with 
   CN1 are denoted by 'a' and CN2 are denoted by 'b' & c while the 
   respective flows for CN3 are denoted byd and 'e'.  
    
   When MN requires to transfer flows `a´ & `b´ (Filter1) to the 
   interface connected to the FN-A, while receiving all the other flows 
   (Default filter) over FN-B, MN sends a new binding as defined in 
   4.1.2 with the N bit set.  
       
   When MN requires transferring flow `d´ to the interface connected to 
   FN-B, MN sends a binding update with HoA-2 and CoA-C, together with 
   CoA-B in the Alternate care-of-address mobility option and with the 
   required filtering extensions (see section 4.1.6). This causes the 
   addition of a new binding entry (HOA-2:CoA-B:Filter1) at HA2. This 
   will not result in any deletion of existing binding entries (HoA-
   2:CoA-C will remain). HA2, will now intercept all flows (d & e), but 
   will tunnel flow `d´ through FN-B, while flow `e´ or any other flows 
   continues through FN-C.

   Figure 1: A mobile node with three points of attachment in  
   different foreign networks (CoA-A, CoA-B & CoA-C) with 2 home 
   addresses (HoA-1 & HoA-2). Incoming flows are redirected by the 
   respective filtering agents (HA1, HA2) to different care-of-
   addresses, based on the filtering rules. 
    
   In the example presented in figure 1, the HA1 & HA2 act as the 
   filtering agents. But, any Mobile IPv6 binding agent (HA, MAP, CN) 
   can act as filtering agents. To return traffic, a mobile node may 
   choose any of the available points of attachment. 
    
   Figure 2, illustrates the second model of operation. It shows the 
   mobile node that maintains two points of attachment in visited domain 
   A and B, while maintaining one active flow from CN1, denoted with 
   a. In this example, MN maintains two bindings with the CN1 for 
   visiting domain A and B. NOMADv6 extensions are applied to share a 
   Filter (Flow a) over point of attachment A and B. However, 
   distribution of single flow could lead to performance degradation 
   when using standard TCP applications. But, for the applications that 
   could be reorder the out of sequence packets at the receiver, this 
   mechanism performs well.

                MAP) to a different care-of address. 
    
    
5 Backword compatibility with basic Mobile IPv6 
    
   If the binding update does not have the N bit set, the processing 
   of the BU is same as [3]. But if the binding agent has already 
   registered multiple care-of addresses for the same home address, the 
   binding agent MUST overwrite all the bindings for the home address 
   specified in the destination option. Binding updates without the N 
   bit set are considered as idle mobility bindings. In order to 
   preserve backward compatibility with the basic protocol [3], it is 
   stated in section 4.1.3 that a Filtering Agent maintaining only idle 
   Mobility Bindings for a mobile is required to act as per [3] and to 
   ignore the behavior presented in this document.  
    
    
6 Associating Filters with Bindings 
    
   This section gives a detailed description of the steps taken by a 
   mobile node that wishes to associate filters with its bindings. 
   Furthermore, it presents how a filtering agent reacts to the receipt 
   of a binding update containing a list of filters. 
    
6.1 Mobile Node Considerations 
    
   A mobile node that acquires a care-of address within a visited domain 
   may issue a binding update containing a list of Filters. All included 
   Filters will be associated with the registered care-of address at all 
   Filtering Agents (HA,CN,MAP). A mobile node that maintains multiple 
   points of attachment may request for simultaneous mobility bindings 
   by setting the N bit in its binding Updates. However, each of the 
   NOMADv6                Expires March 2006                        12 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings        Oct 2005 
   binding updates must contain its own list of filters. Should the 
   binding update be rejected then the mobile node will receive a 
   Filtering Acknowledgement with a binding acknowledgement Extension 
   indicating the Index of the Filter that was rejected along with the 
   reason for rejection.  
    
   It is important for a mobile node to keep a record of the Filters    
   and their corresponding Index numbers per home address.  
    
   For the management of Filters eight scenarios are identified. These  
   are presented along with the actions to be undertaken by the mobile  
   node.  
    
 6.1.1 Creating a new mobility binding with Filters  
    
   In order to create a new mobility binding with associated Filters,  
   the mobile node MUST issue a binding update including one or more  
   full Filter definitions (one or more Filter modules with Filter  
   Control Extension) as mobility options, attached to the binding 
   update mobility header. Each of the Filters MUST be allocated a 
   different Index number. 
    
   The destination of the Filtering Update is identified as described  
   in [3].  
    
 6.1.2 Replacing a Filter of a mobility binding by Index  
        
   In order for a mobile node to replace an existing Filter, it is   
   required to issue a binding update with a full definition of the    
   new Filter. The Filter Control Extension of the Filter must indicate  
   the Index of the Filter to be replaced. The Weight value of the new 
   Filter MAY be different from the Weight of the previous Filter 
   definition.  
    
 6.1.3 Adding new Filters to an existing mobility binding  
        
   In order for a mobile node to add new Filters to an existing mobility 
   binding, it is required to act as if creating a new mobility binding 
   with Filters. It is necessary for the new Filter to adopt an 
   unallocated Index number otherwise it would be replacing an existing  
   Filter with that Index.  
    
 6.1.4 Sharing a Filter between mobility binding 
  
   A mobile node may share a Filter between mobility bindings by    
   issuing a binding update from each respective point of   attachment. 
   The first one will contain the full Filter (Filter Body + Filter 
   Control Extension) while all subsequent Filtering Requests    will 
   contain only a Filter Control Extension indicating the Index    
   number of the Filter to be shared. 
    
 6.1.5 Renewing a mobility binding with Filters  
    
   Periodically, a mobile node is required to renew its mobility 
   bindings in order to extend their lifetime. Renewing a mobility   
   NOMADv6                Expires March 2006                        13 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings        Oct 2005 
   binding may occur as described in [3]. The mobile node sets the N 
   bit, when sending a binding update in order to renew all filters 
   allocated for the home address defined in the destination option.    
    
 6.1.6 Deleting a defined Filter/s for a mobility binding  
    
   In order for a mobile node to delete an existing Filter for a    
   mobility binding, it is required to issue a binding update from  
   any care-of address. The binding update must include a Filter 
   Deletion Extensions indicating the Index of each Filter to be 
   deleted. 
    
 6.1.7 Deleting all Filters for a mobility binding  
    
   In order for a mobile node to delete all existing Filters for a    
   mobility binding, it is required to issue a binding update from  
   any care-of address. The binding update must include a Filter 
   Deletion Extensions with the Index field set to zero. 
    
 6.1.8 Transferring a Filter between mobility bindings  
    
   It is required to act as if creating a new mobility binding with 
   Filters and send out a binding update from the point of attachment to 
   which it wants to transfer the Filter to the other. The Filtering 
   Update must attach the Alternate Care-of-Address mobility option and 
   must contain the full Filter. Alternate care-of-address option 
   contains the care-of-address of the point of attachment, which the 
   filter should be transferred. In this way, the transferring of 
   filters are possible irrespective of the same or different home 
   addresses used for each of attachment.  
    
   The Weight field of the Filter Control Extension indicates the 
   relative amount of traffic for which a Filter is applicable. If the 
   Weight field is set to zero then all matching flows will be dropped 
   without notification to their source. For any other value of Weight, 
   matching flows will get forwarded to the point of attachment 
   indicated by the corresponding mobility binding. In the case of 
   shared Filters, packets of matching flows will get distributed 
   between multiple points of attachment with respect to the Weight 
   value of each Filter. 
    
6.2 Filtering Agent Considerations 
    
   This section contains considerations for Filtering Agents. These are 
   Mobile IPv6 entities that can maintain mobility bindings such as HAs, 
   CNs or MAPs when hierarchical Mobile IPv6 is supported.  
      
   Should the Filtering Agent fail to apply any of the Filters then for 
   each such Filter a Filter Acknowledgement Extension must be included 
   in the Filtering Acknowledgement indicating the Index of the rejected 
   Filter along with the reason of rejection. If authentication of the 
   Filtering Update fails, then none of the Filters MUST be applied.  
    
   NOMADv6                Expires March 2006                        14 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings        Oct 2005 
   Should the Filtering Agent succeed in applying the Filters, then the 
   Filtering Acknowledgement indicating the index of the success MUST be 
   sent, only if `A´ bit is set on the Binding Update. 
    
   When a Filtering Agent intercepts a packet for a mobile node for   
   which it maintains a mobility binding, it is required to identify   
   whether the packet matches any of the Filters associated with the    
   mobility binding. If so, the packet is handled as described by the 
   Weight value of the corresponding Filter. If no matching Filter is 
   found then the packet is handled as indicated by the Default Filter.  
    
   When a mobility binding expires or is deregistered by a mobile node  
   then all associated Filters are deleted with it. Whenever a Filtering 
   Agent received a Filtering Update without setting the N bit (i.e. 
   Binding Update), it is required to overwrite all the bindings set for 
   the home address and keep the binding for the new care-of-address, 
   sent. This binding is called the Idle Mobility Binding and it is 
   required to ignore the behavior described in this document and to act 
   as per [3]. 
    
    
7 NOMADv6 Extensions to MIPv6 Binding Messages 
    
   In this section, the new Mobile IPv6 extensions required to support 
   the Filters for Mobile IPv6 bindings are specified. 
    
   All filtering extensions are sent as mobility options of the binding 
   update or binding acknowledgment mobility header as defined in [3]. 
   The filtering extensions are encoded using a type-length-value (TLV) 
   format in the mobility options.  
    
   A complete mobility header, once filter extensions are attached 
   SHOULD be an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  
    
   Filter extensions can be categorized into 4 types, 
    
        o Filter Module Extensions 
        o Filter Control Extension 
        o Filter Deletion Extension 
        o Filter Acknowledgement Extension 
    
   The Filter Module Extensions specify the different filtering rules 
   that the mobile node wishes to inform the Filtering Agent. There are 
   10 such filter extensions.  These extensions are always attached to 
   the Binding Update mobility header as mobility option/s. To form a 
   valid Filter, at least one of the filter module extensions must be 
   included. The Filter Control Extension must appear once in every 
   Filter following all Filter Modules. Filter control extension may 
   appear more than once in a binding update interleaving with Filter 
   declarations.  
    
   Filter Modules of the same type may not appear in a Filter more than

   any of the predicates in it. In addition, there is an AND 
   relationship between Filter Modules of a Filter. As such, in order  
   for a flow to match a Filter, it is required to qualify for all its  
   Filter Modules. 
    
   In Filter Modules, the first byte of the data is allocated to define 
   the types of the Filter Modules. The left most bit of the Sub-Type 
   field is used to determine whether the rules included in the Filter 
   Module are positive or negative. In the first case, a flow is 
   required to match exactly the predicates included in the Filter 
   Module while in the second the inverted (NOT) rule is applied. 
    
   The Filter Deletion extension is an extension sent to the Filtering 
   Agent by the mobile node to deleted filter/s. This extension is 
   attached to Binding Update mobility header. The Filter 
   Acknowledgement extension is an extension sent to the mobile node by 
   the Filtering Agent to inform of success or any failure of filter 
   accommodation. This extension is attached to Binding Acknowledgement 
   mobility header.

   Offset               Indicates the starting octet location within an  
                        IPv6 packet to use to mask with the Mask and  
                        check with Value. 
    
   Value                Indicates the value to be checked, once masked. 
    
   Mask                 Indicates the value to use as the mask to mask  
                        the octets starting from the offset. 
    
    
   The area indicated by the offset and for a length equivalent to that 
   of Mask is compared against Mask with the bitwise operator AND. The  
   result of this operation is compared against Value. A match would  
   indicate that the packet qualifies the filter. 
                        
   Value and Mask fields MUST have exactly the same size. However, the 
   length of the Value and Mask may vary with every free-form filter. 
   For the sizes of Value and Mask the following condition holds: 
    
     Value = Mask = (Length - 4) / 2

            CAN NOT DROP MIP SIG     TBD  
        
   The Error Code CAN NOT DROP MIP SIG is used when the mobile node  
   issues a Filtering Update requesting the drop of flows corresponding 
   to Mobile IPv6 signalling such as Router Advertisements, Binding 
   Update, Binding Refresh Request, Binding Acknowledgement or Binding 
   Error. 
    
8. Security considerations 
    
   Since the filter extensions defined in this document only concern the 
   messaging between the home agent (or correspondent node with route 
   optimization) and the MN, all security mechanisms that are defined in 
   [3] is considered sufficient to protect the integrity and 
   authenticity of filter extensions that are attached with Binding 
   Update and Binding acknowledgement messages.
