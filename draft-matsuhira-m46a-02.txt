            Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapped IPv6 address (M46A)
                        draft-matsuhira-m46a-02

Abstract

   This document specifies Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapped IPv6
   address(M46A) spefification.  M46A is IPv4 mapped IPv6 address with
   plane ID.  Unique allocation of plane id value enable IPv4 private
   address unique in IPv6 address space.  This address may use IPv4 over
   IPv6 encapsulation and IPv4 - IPv6 translation.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapped IPv6
   address(M46A) spefification.  M46A is IPv4 mapped IPv6 address with
   plane ID.  Unique allocation of plane ID value enable IPv4 private
   address unique in IPv6 address space.

   This address may use IPv4 over IPv6 encapsulation such as Multiple
   IPv4 - IPv6 mapping encapsulation - fixed prefix (M46E-FP) M46E-FP
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-fp], Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapping
   encapsulation - prefix resolution (M46E-PR)M46E-PR
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-pr], Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapping
   encapsuration - prefix translator (M46E-PT)M46E-PT
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-pt] and IPv4 - IPv6 translation such as
   Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapping translator (M46T)M46T
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46t].


2.  M46A architecture

   Figure 1 shows M46A architecture.


    |      96 - m bits      |          m bits          |     32 bits  |
    +-----------------------+--------------------------+--------------+
    |      M46A prefix      |  IPv4 network plane ID   | IPv4 address |
    +-----------------------+--------------------------+--------------+

                                 Figure 1

   M46A consists of three parts as follows.

   M46A prefix

      M46A prefix.  This value is fixed value with M46E-FP, and non
      fixed value with M46E-PR.

   IPv4 network plane ID

      IPv4 network plane ID is network identification of IPv4 network
      plane.

   IPv4 address

      IPv4 address
