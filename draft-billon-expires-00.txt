            Updated Use of the Expires Message Header Field
                        draft-billon-expires-00

Abstract

   This document allows broader use of the Expires message header field.
   Senders can then indicate when a message sent becomes valueless and
   can safely be deleted.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4021] defines a number of header fields that can be added to
   Internet messages such as those used for mapping between X.400 and
   RFC822/MIME [RFC2156].  One of them is the Expires header field that
   provides the date and time at which a message is considered to lose
   its validity.

   The same principle can be applied to the Expires header field in a
   SMTP context, whether the message comes from a X.400 gateway as
   initially intended in [RFC2156], or from a RFC821/SMTP MTA.

   The date and time of expiration can be used by the mailbox provider
   or the MUA to indicate to the user that certain messages could be
   deleted, in an attempt to unclutter the user's mailbox and spare
   storage resources.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Header Field example

   The field definition and syntax remain the same.

   expires = "Expires" ":" date-time

   Example:

   Expires: Wed, 1 Dec 2021 17:22:57 +0000

   There should be only one occurrence of the header field in a single
   message.  The presence of more than one Expires header would make
   them void.

3.  Security considerations

   The expiration of a message's validity should lead to the deletion of
   the message.  In certain cases, such as emails being used as proof or
   element of investigation, an early deletion may compromise the
   intended investigation.  For this reason, we want to avoid the header
   field to be tempered with.

3.1.  DKIM

   Senders including the Expires header field MUST sign the message with
   DKIM [RFC6376] and include the field in the h= tag.

   Receivers MUST NOT consider the value provided in the Expires header
   field if the DKIM check fails.

4.  Implementation and Usage Consideration

4.1.  Advice to senders

   Senders SHOULD add the header field along with a relevant date and
   time whenever applicable.

   Commercial newsletters are good candidates, especially when including
   time-limited offers.

   Social notification and one-time-password emails SHOULD include the
   Expires header field, with an expiration set within a few days at
   most.

   Payment receipts, bank statements, contracts and other emails that
   should be kept or archived by the recipient SHOULD NOT include the
   Expires header field.

5.  Advice to Receivers (Mailbox providers, Webmails and MUAs)

   Generally, no email should be automatically deleted solely based on
   the value of the Expires header field.

   The information provided in the header should be used as a signal
   that could be used to provide a feature or improved experience to the
   end-user.  Automation of email deletion based on the value of the
   Expires header may be set by the end-user.

   Receivers can prevent deletion from happening if necessary.

   Presence of the Expires header field MUST NOT be interpreted as a
   sign of legitimacy.
