 5G End-to-end Network Slice Mapping from the view of Transport Network
                draft-geng-teas-network-slice-mapping-00

Abstract

   Network Slicing is one of the core featrures in 5G.  End-to-end
   network slicing consists of 3 major types of network segments: Access
   Network (AN), Mobile Core Network (CN) and Transport Network (TN).
   This draft describes the procedure of mapping relationship between 5G
   end-to-end network slice into and transport network slice defined in
   IETF.  This draft also intends to expose some gaps in the existing
   network management plane and data plane to support inter-domain
   network slice mapping.  Further work may require cooperation between
   IETF and 3GPP (or other standard organizations).  The definition of
   data model, signaling protocol extension and new encapsulation is out
   of the scope of this draft.

1.  Introduction

   Driven by the new applications of 5G, the concept of network slicing
   is defined to provide a logical network with specific network
   capabilities and network characteristics.  Network slice contains a
   set of network functions and the required resources(e.g.
   Computation, storage and network resources).According to [TS28530], a
   5G end-to-end network slice consists of three major types network
   segments: Radio Access Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and
   Mobile Core Network (CN).  Transport network is supposed to provide

   the required connectivity between AN and CN, which specific
   performance commitment.  For each end-to-end network slice, the
   topology and performance requirement on transport network can be very
   different, which requires transport network to have the capability of
   supporting multiple different transport network slices.

   A transport network slice is a virtual (logical) network with a
   particular network topology and a set of shared or dedicated network
   resources, which are used to provide the network slice consumer with
   the required connectivity, appropriate isolation and specific Service
   Level Agreement (SLA).  A transport network slice could span multiple
   technology (IP, Optical) and multiple administrative domains.
   Depending on the consumer's requirement, a transport network slice
   could be isolated from other, often concurrent transport network
   slices in terms of data plane, control plane and management plane.
   Transport network slice is being defined and discussed in IETF.

   The procedure of end-to-end network slice instance creation, network
   slice subnet instance creation and network slice instance termination
   in management plane are defined in [TS28531].  The end-to-end network
   slice allocation is defined in ETSI ZSM003.  But there is no
   specifications about how to map end-to-end network slice in 5G system
   to transport network slice.  This draft describes the procedure of
   mapping 5G end-to-end network slice into transport network slice in
   management plane, control plane and user plane.

3.1.  Requirements Profile

   In order to satisfy a tenant's request for a network slice with
   certain characteristics, creating a new network slice or using
   existing network slice instance is constrained by the customer's
   requirement and the capability of the network slices.

   o  Service Profile: represents the properties of network slice
      related requirement that should be supported by the network slice
      instance in 5G network.  Service profile is defined in [TS28541]
      6.3.3.

   o  TN Network Slice Profile: represents the properties of transport
      network slice related requirement that should be supported by the
      transport network slice in a 5G network.  Slice Profile is defined

      in [TS28541] 6.3.4.  TN Network slice profile is newly defined in
      this draft.

3.2.  Identifiers

   Network slice related identifiers in management plane, control plane
   and user(data) plane play an important role in end-to-end network
   slice mapping.

   o  Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information(S-NSSAI):
      end-to-end network slice identifier in control plane, which is
      defined in [TS23501];

   o  Network Slice Instance(NSI) Identifier: end-to-end network slice
      identifier in management plane, which is created in NSMF; NSI is
      is set of Network Function instances and the required resources
      (e.g. compute, storage and networking resources) which form a
      deployed Network Slice, which is defined in [TS23501];

   o  Transport Network Slice Instance(TN-NSSI) Identifier: transport
      network slice identifier in management plane, which is created in
      TN NSSMF; TN-NSSI is newly defined in this draft.

   o  Transport Network Slice Interworking Identifier (TNSII): network
      slice identifier which is used for mapping end-to-end network
      slice into transport network slice in user plane.  TNSII is newly
      defined in this draft.

   o  Transport Network Slice Identifier(TNSI): transport network slice
      identifier in data plane(user plane).  TNSI is newly defined in
      this draft.

   The relationship between these identifiers are specifies in the
   following sections.

3.3.  Relevant functions

   There are a set of slice relevant functions that are necessary for
   transport network slice management:

   o  Topology management

   o  QoS management

   o  Resource management

   o  Measurement management

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title              February 2020


   o  ...

   Some of these functions are implemented inside the transport network
   and independent from the end-to-end network slice, e.g., topology
   management, QoS management, resource management; Some of the
   functions are related to the end-to-end network slice and should
   cooperate with other network elements from other domain, e.g.,
   Measurement management.

4.  Network Slice Mapping Procedure

   This section provides a general procedure of network slice mapping:

   1.  NSMF receives the request from CSMF for allocation of the network
   slice instance with certain characteristics.

   2.  Based on the service requirement , the Network Slice Management
   Function(NSMF) acquires the properties of network slice related
   requirement that should be supported by the network slice instance in
   5G network, which is defined in Service Profile([TS28541] section
   6.3.3).

   3.  NSMF needs to decide on the constituent NSSIs(including AN NSSI,
   CN NSSI and TN NSSI) to be created using the information from service



Geng, et al.             Expires August 17, 2020                [Page 7]

   profile and the endpoint information(AN/CN edge nodes) . So NSMF
   derives transport network slice related requirements from the Service
   profile, and maintains them in Transport Network Slice Profile.  So
   as to CN Slice Profile and AN Slice Profile.

   4.  Transport Network Slice Profile is sent to TN NSSMF to request
   allocation of the required TN NSSI(s).

   5.  TN NSSMF allocates TN network slicing subnet instance(TN NSSI)
   which could satisfy the requirement between the specified endpoints
   (AN/CN edge nodes) in Transport Network Slice Profile and sends the
   TN NSSI Identifier to NSMF.

   6.  NSMF acquires the mapping relationship between NSI Identifier and
   TN NSSI Identifier.

   7.  When a PDU session is set up between AN and CN, S-NSSAI is used
   to choose network slice instance for the PDU session.

   8.  For a user packet in a particular network slice that to be sent
   to transport network, the AN/CN edge nodes encapsulate the packet
   using the transport network slice interworking identifier (TNSII)
   according to the S-NSSAI or the NSI.  Network Slice could also be
   differentiated by physical interface, if different network slices are
   transported through different interface;

   9.  The edge node of transport network parses the TNSII from the
   packet and maps the packet to the corresponding transport network
   slice.  It may encapsulate a transport network slice identifier
   (TNSI) into the packet. .

   10.  The nodes in transport network transit the packet inside the
   corresponding transport network slice.

   The procedure of end-to-end network slice mapping involves the
   mapping in three network planes: management plane, control plane and
   data plane.

4.1.  Network Slice Mapping in Management Plane

   The transport network management Plane maintains the interface
   between NSMF and TN NSSMF, which 1) guarantees that transport network
   slice could connect the AN and CN with specified characteristics that
   satisfy the requirements of communication; 2) builds up the mapping
   relationship between NSI identifier and TN NSSI identifier; 3)
   maintains the end-to-end slice relevant functions;

   Service Profile defined in[TS28541] represents the requirement of
   end-to-end network slice instance in 5G network.  Parameters defined
   in Service Profile include Latency, resource sharing level,
   availability and so on.  How to decompose the end-to-end requirement
   to the transport network requirement is one of the key issues in
   Network slice requirement mapping.  GSMA(Global System for Mobile
   Communications Association) defines the [GST] to indicate the network
   slice requirement from the view of service provider.
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi] analysis the parameters of GST and
   categorize the parameters into three classes, including the
   attributes with direct impact on the transport network slice
   definition.  It is a good start for selecting the transport network
   relevant parameters in order to define Network Slice Profile for
   Transport Network.  Network slice requirement parameters are also
   necessary for the definition of transport network northbound
   interface.

   Inside the TN NSSMF, it is supposed to maintain the attributes of the
   transport network slice.  If the attributes of an existing TN NSSI
   could satisfy the requirement from TN Network Slice Profile, the
   existing TN NSSI could be selected and the mapping is finished If
   there is no existing TN NSSI which could satisfy the requirement, a
   new TN NSSI is supposed to be created by the NSSMF with new
   attributes.

   TN NSSI resource reservation should be considered to avoid over
   allocation from multiple requests from NSMF (but the detailed
   mechanism should be out of scope in the draft)

   TN NSSMF sends the selected or newly allocated TN NSSI identifier to
   NSMF.  The mapping relationship between NSI identifier and TN NSSI
   identifier is maintained in both NSMF and TN NSSMF.

4.2.  Network Slice Mapping in Control Plane

   There is no explicit interaction between transport network and AN/CN
   in the control plane, but the S-NSSAI defined in[TS23501] is treated
   as the end-to-end network slice identifier in the control plane of AN
   and CN, which is used in UE registration and PDU session setup.  In
   this draft, we assume that there is mapping relationship between
   S-NSSAI and NSI in the management plane, thus it could be mapped to a
   transport network slice .

   Editor's note: The mapping relationship between NSI defined in
   [TS23501] and S-NSSAI defined in [TS23501] is still in discussion.

4.3.  Network Slice Mapping in data plane

   If multiple network slices are carried through one physical interface
   between AN/CN and TN, transport network slice interworking
   identifier(TNSII) in the data plane needs to be introduced.  If
   different network slices are transported through different physical
   interfaces, Network Slices could be distinguished by the interface
   directly.  Thus TNSII is not the only option for network slice
   mapping, while it may help in introducing new network slices.

4.3.1.  Data Plane Mapping Considerations

   The mapping relationship between AN or CN network slice identifier
   (either S-NSSAI in control plane or NSI/NSSI in management plane) and
   TNSII needs to be maintained in AN/CN network nodes, and the mapping
   relationship between TNSII and TNSI is maintained in the edge node of
   transport network.  When the packet of a uplink flow goes from AN to
   TN, the packet is encapsulated based on the TNSII; then the
   encapsulation of TNSII is read by the edge node of transport network,
   which maps the packet to the corresponding transport network slice.

   Editor's Note: We have considered to add "Network Instance" defined
   in [TS23501]in the draft.  However, after the discussion with 3GPP
   people, we think the concept of "network instance" is a 'neither
   Necessary nor Sufficient Condition' for network slice.  Network
   Instance could be determined by S-NSSAI, it could also depends on
   other information; Network slice could also be allocated without
   network instance (in my understanding) And, TNSII is not a
   competitive concept with network instance.TNSII is a concept for the
   data plane interconnection with transport network, network instance
   may be used by AN and CN nodes to associate a network slice with
   TNSII

4.3.2.  Data Plane Mapping Design

   The following picture shows the end-to-end network slice in data
   plane:

   +--+       +-----+                           +----------------+

    |<----AN NS---->|<----------TN NS---------->|<----CN NS----->|


   The mapping between 3GPP slice and transport slice in user plane
   could happens in:

   not only exist between AN and CN but may also within AN NS and CN NS.
   However, here we just show the TN between AN and CN as an example to
   avoid unncessary complexity.

   The following picture shows the user plane protocol stack in end-to-
   end 5G system.

4.3.2.1.  Layer 3 and Layer 2 Encapsulations

   If the encapsulation above IP layer is not visible to Transport
   Network, it is not able to be used for network slice interworking
   with transport network.  In this case, IP header and Ethernet header
   could be considered to provide information of network slice
   interworking from AN or CN to TN.

   +------------------------+
   |       Ethernet         |
   +------------------------+

   The following field in IP header and Ethernet header could be
   considered :

   IP Header:

   o  DSCP: It is traditionally used for the mapping of QoS identifier
      between AN/CN and TN network.  Although some values (e.g.  The
      unassigned code points) may be borrowed for the network slice
      interworking, it may cause confusion between QoS mapping and
      network slicing mapping.;

   o  Destination Address: It is possible to allocate different IP
      addresses for entities in different network slice, then the
      destination IP address could be used as the network slice
      interworking identifier.  However, it brings additional
      requirement to IP address planning.  In addition, in some cases
      some AN or CN network slices may use duplicated IP addresses.

   o  Option fields/headers: It requires that both AN and CN nodes can
      support the encapsulation and decapsulation of the options.

   Ethernet header

   o  VLAN ID: It is widely used for the interconnection between AN/CN
      nodes and the edge nodes of transport network for the access to
      different VPNs.  One possible problem is that the number of VLAN

      ID can be supported by AN nodes is typically limited, which
      effects the number of transport network slices a AN node can
      attach to.  Another problem is the total amount of VLAN ID (4K)
      may not provide a comparable space as the network slice
      identifiers of mobile networks.

   Two or more options described above may also be used together as the
   TNSII, while it would make the mapping relationship more complex to
   maintain.

   In some other case, when AN or CN could support more layer 3
   encapsulations, more options are available as follows:

   If the AN or CN could support MPLS, the protocol stack could be as
   follows:

   +------------------------+-----------
   | Application Protocols  |      ^
   +------------------------+      |
   |       IP (User)        |  Invisible
   +------------------------+     for
   |          GTP           |     TN
   +------------------------+      |
   |          UDP           |      V

   |         MPLS           |

   |          IP            |
   +------------------------+
   |       Ethernet         |
   +------------------------+

   A specified MPLS label could be used to as a TNSII.

   If the AN or CN could support SRv6, the protocol stack is as follows:

   |       Ethernet         |

   The following field could be considered to identify a network slice:

   SRH:

   o  SRv6 functions: AN/CN is supposed to support the new function
      extension of SRv6.

   o  Optional TLV: AN/CN is supposed to support the extension of
      optional TLV of SRH.

4.3.2.2.  Above Layer 3 Encapsulations

   If the encapsulation above IP layer is visible to Transport Network,
   it is able to be used to identify a network slice.  In this case, UPD
   and GTP-U could be considered to provide information of network slice
   interworking between AN or CN and TN.

   UDP Header:

   o  UDP Source port: The UDP source port is sometimes used for load
      balancing.  Using it for network slice mapping would require to
      disable the load-balancing behavior.
