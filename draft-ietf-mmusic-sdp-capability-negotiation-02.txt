Abstract 

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing 
   multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session 
   invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was 
   not intended to provide capability indication or capability 
   negotiation, however over the years, SDP has seen widespread adoption 
   and as a result it has been gradually extended to provide limited 
   support for these. SDP and its current extensions however do not have 
   the ability to negotiate one or more alternative transport protocols

   (e.g. RTP profiles) which makes it particularly difficult to deploy 
   new RTP profiles such as secure RTP or RTP with RTCP-based feedback. 
   The purpose of this document is to address that and other real-life 
   limitations by extending SDP with capability negotiation parameters 
   and associated offer/answer procedures to use those parameters in a 
   backwards compatible manner.  

   The solution provided in this document provides a general SDP 
   capability negotiation framework. It also defines specifically how to 
   provide attributes and transport protocols as capabilities and 
   negotiate them using the framework. Extensions for other types of 
   capabilities (e.g. media types and formats) may be provided in other 
   documents.

1. Introduction 

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing 
   multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session 
   invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. The SDP 
   contains one or more media stream descriptions with information such 
   as IP-address and port, type of media stream (e.g. audio or video), 
   transport protocol (possibly including profile information, e.g. 
   RTP/AVP or RTP/SAVP), media formats (e.g. codecs), and various other 
   session and media stream parameters that define the session.  

   Simply providing media stream descriptions is sufficient for session 
   announcements for a broadcast application, where the media stream 
   parameters are fixed for all participants. When a participant wants 
   to join the session, he obtains the session announcement and uses the 
   media descriptions provided, e.g., joins a multicast group and 
   receives media packets in the encoding format specified.  If the 
   media stream description is not supported by the participant, he is 
   unable to receive the media.  

   Such restrictions are not generally acceptable to multimedia session 
   invitations, where two or more entities attempt to establish a media 
   session that uses a set of media stream parameters acceptable to all 
   participants. First of all, each entity must inform the other of its 
   receive address, and secondly, the entities need to agree on the 
   media stream parameters to use for the session, e.g. transport 
   protocols and codecs. We here make a distinction between the 
   capabilities supported by each participant, the way in which those 
   capabilities can be supported and the parameters that can actually be 
   used for the session. More generally, we can say that we have the 
   following: 

   o  A set of capabilities for the session and its associated media 
      stream components, supported by each side.

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   o  A set of potential configurations indicating which of those 
      capabilities can be used for the session and its associated media 
      stream components.  

   o  A set of actual configurations for the session and its associated 
      media stream components, which specifies which combinations of 
      session parameters and media stream components to use and with 
      what parameters. 

   o  A negotiation process that takes the set of potential 
      configurations (combinations of capabilities) as input and 
      provides the actual configurations as output.  

   SDP by itself was designed to provide only one of these, namely the 
   actual configurations, however over the years, use of SDP has been 
   extended beyond its original scope.  Session negotiation semantics 
   were defined by the offer/answer model in RFC 3264.  It defines how 
   two entities, an offerer and an answerer, exchange session 
   descriptions to negotiate a session. The offerer can include one or 
   more media formats (codecs) per media stream, and the answerer then 
   selects one or more of those offered and returns them in an answer. 
   Both the offer and the answer contain actual configurations; 
   capabilities and potential configurations are not supported. The 
   answer however may reduce the set of actual configurations from the 
   offer as well as extend the set of actual configurations that can be 
   used to receive media by the answerer.  

   Other relevant extensions have been defined. Simple capability 
   declarations, which define how to provide a simple and limited set of 
   capability descriptions in SDP was defined in RFC 3407.  Grouping of 
   media lines, which defines how media lines in SDP can have other 
   semantics than the traditional "simultaneous media streams" 
   semantics, was defined in RFC 3388, etc.   

   Each of these extensions was designed to solve a specific limitation 
   of SDP.  Since SDP had already been stretched beyond its original 
   intent, a more comprehensive capability declaration and negotiation 
   process was intentionally not defined.  Instead, work on a "next 
   generation" of a protocol to provide session description and 
   capability negotiation was initiated [SDPng].  SDPng however has not 
   gained traction and has remained as work in progress for an extended 
   period of time.  Existing real-time multimedia communication 
   protocols such as SIP, RTSP, Megaco, and MGCP continue to use SDP.  
   SDP and its current extensions however do not address an increasingly 
   important problem: the ability to negotiate one or more alternative 
   transport protocols (e.g., RTP profiles).  This makes it difficult to 
   deploy new RTP profiles such as secure RTP (SRTP) [SRTP], RTP with 
 
 
Andreasen              Expires August 13, 2007                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   RTCP-Based Feedback [AVPF], etc.  This particular problem is 
   exacerbated by the fact that RTP profiles are defined independently.  
   When a new profile is defined and N other profiles already exist, 
   there is a potential need for defining N additional profiles, since 
   profiles cannot be combined automatically.  For example, in order to 
   support the plain and secure RTP version of RTP with and without 
   RTCP-based feedback, four separate profiles (and hence profile 
   definitions) are needed: RTP/AVP [RFC3551], RTP/SAVP [SRTP], RTP/AVPF 
   [AVPF], and RTP/SAVPF [SAVPF].  In addition to the pressing profile 
   negotiation problem, other important real-life limitations have been 
   found as well.  

   The purpose of this document is to define a mechanism that enables 
   SDP to provide limited support for indicating capabilities and their 
   associated potential configurations, and negotiate the use of those 
   potential configurations as actual configurations.  It is not the 
   intent to provide a full-fledged capability indication and 
   negotiation mechanism along the lines of SDPng or ITU-T H.245. 
   Instead, the focus is on addressing a set of well-known real-life 
   limitations. More specifically, the solution provided in this 
   document provides a general SDP capability negotiation framework. It 
   also defines specifically how to provide attributes and transport 
   protocols as capabilities and negotiate them using the framework. 
   Extensions for other types of capabilities (e.g. media types and 
   formats) may be provided in other documents. 

   As mentioned above, SDP is used by several protocols, and hence the 
   mechanism should be usable by all of these.  One particularly 
   important protocol for this problem is the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  SIP uses the offer/answer model (which is 
   not specific to SIP) to negotiate sessions and hence the mechanism 
   defined here defines the offer/answer procedures to use for the 
   capability negotiation framework.  

   The rest of the document is structured as follows. In Section 3. we 
   present our SDP capability negotiation solution, which consists of 
   new SDP attributes and associated offer/answer procedures. In Section 
   4. we provide examples illustrating its use and in Section 5. we 
   provide the security considerations.

3. SDP Capability Negotiation Solution 

   In this section we first provide an overview of the SDP Capability 
   negotiation solution. This is followed by definitions of new SDP 
   attributes for the solution and its associated updated offer/answer 
   procedures.  

3.1. Solution Overview  

   The solution consists of the following: 

   o  Two new attributes to support versioning and extensions to the 
      framework itself as follows: 

       o  A new attribute ("a=csup") that lists the supported base and 
          extension options to the framework. 

       o  A new attribute ("a=creq") that lists the base and or 
          extensions to the framework that are required to be supported 
          by the entity receiving the SDP in order to do capability 
          negotiation. 

   o  Two new attributes used to express capabilities as follows 
      (additional attributes can be defined as extensions): 

       o  A new attribute ("a=acap") that defines how to list attribute 
          parameter values ("a=" values) as capabilities.  

       o  A new attribute ("a=tcap") that defines how to list transport 
          protocols (e.g. "RTP/AVP") as capabilities. 

   o  Two new attributes to negotiate configurations as follows: 

       o  A new attribute ("a=pcfg") that lists the potential 
          configurations supported. This is done by reference to the 
          capabilities from the SDP in question. Multiple potential 
          configurations have an explicitly indicated ordering 
          associated with them. Extension capabilities can be defined 
          and referenced in the potential configurations.  

       o  A new attribute ("a=acfg") to be used in an answer SDP. The 
          attribute identifies which of the potential configurations 
          from an offer SDP were used as actual configurations to form 
          the answer SDP. Extension capabilities can be included as 
          well.

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   o  Extensions to the offer/answer model that allow for capabilities 
      and potential configurations to be included in an offer. 
      Capabilities can be provided at the session level or the media 
      level. Potential configurations can be included at the media level 
      only, where they constitute alternative offers that may be 
      accepted by the answerer instead of the actual configuration(s) 
      included in the "m=" line(s). The answerer indicates which (if 
      any) of the potential configurations it used to form the answer by 
      including the actual configuration attribute ("a=acfg") in the 
      answer.  Capabilities may be included in answers as well, where 
      they can aid in guiding a subsequent new offer. 

   The mechanism is illustrated by the offer/answer exchange below, 
   where Alice sends an offer to Bob:  

                Alice                               Bob 

                  | (1) Offer (SRTP and RTP)         | 
                  |--------------------------------->| 
                  |                                  | 
                  | (2) Answer (SRTP)                | 
                  |<---------------------------------| 
                  |                                  | 

   Alice's offer includes RTP and SRTP as alternatives. RTP is the 
   default (actual configuration), but SRTP is the preferred one 
   (potential configuration): 

      v=0 
      o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      t=0 0 
      m=audio 3456 RTP/AVP 0 18  
      a=creq: v0 
      a=tcap:1 RTP/SAVP  
      a=acap:1 a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32    
         inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32  
      a=pcfg:1 t=1 a=1   

   The "m=" line indicates that Alice is offering to use plain RTP with 
   PCMU or G.729.  The required base and extensions are provided by the 
   "a=creq" attribute, which includes the option tag "v0" to indicate 
   that the base framework defined here must be supported. The 
   capabilities are provided by the "a=tcap" and "a=acap" attributes. 
   The transport capabilities ("a=tcap") indicate that secure RTP under 
   the AVP profile ("RTP/SAVP") is supported with an associated

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   transport capability handle of 1. The "acap" attribute provides an 
   attribute capability with a handle of 1. The attribute capability is 
   a "crypto" attribute, which provides the keying material for SRTP 
   using SDP security descriptions [SDES]. The "a=pcfg" attribute 
   provides the potential configuration included in the offer by 
   reference to the capability parameters.  One alternative is provided; 
   it has a configuration number of 1 and it consists of transport 
   protocol capability 1 (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile - secure RTP), and 
   the attribute capability 1, i.e. the crypto attribute provided. 
   Potential configurations are always preferred over actual 
   configurations, and hence Alice is expressing a preference for using 
   secure RTP. 

   Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports SRTP and the SDP 
   Capability Negotiation framework, and hence he accepts the 
   (preferred) potential configuration for Secure RTP provided by Alice: 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      t=0 0 
      m=audio 4567 RTP/SAVP 0 18  
      a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80 
            inline:PS1uQCVeeCFCanVmcjkpPywjNWhcYD0mXXtxaVBR|2^20|1:4
      a=acfg:1 t=1 a=1 

   Bob includes the "a=acfg" attribute in the answer to inform Alice 
   that he based his answer on an offer containing the potential 
   configuration with transport protocol capability 1 and attribute 
   capability 1 from the offer SDP (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile using the 
   keying material provided).  Bob also includes his keying material in 
   a crypto attribute. If Bob supported one or more extensions to the 
   capability negotiation framework, he would have included those in the 
   answer as well (in an "a=csup" attribute). 

   Note that in this particular example, the answerer supported the 
   capability negotiation extensions defined here, however had he not, 
   the answerer would simply have ignored the new attributes and 
   accepted the (actual configuration) offer to use normal RTP. In that 
   case, the following answer would have been generated instead: 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.2

3.2. Version and Extension Indication Attributes 

   In this section, we present the new attributes associated with 
   indicating the SDP capability negotiation extensions supported and 
   required.  

3.2.1. Supported Capability Negotiation Extensions Attribute 

   The SDP Capability negotiation solution allows for capability 
   negotiation extensions to be defined. Associated with each such 
   extension is an option tag that identifies the extension in question. 
   Option-tags MUST be registered with IANA per the procedures defined 
   in Section 6.  

   The Supported Capability Negotiation Extensions attribute ("a=csup") 
   contains a comma-separated list of option tags identifying the SDP 
   Capability negotiation extensions supported by the entity that 
   generated the SDP. The attribute is defined as follows: 

      a=csup: <option-tag-list> 

   RFC 4566, Section 9, provides the ABNF for SDP attributes. The "csup" 
   attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, with an 
   att-value defined as follows: 

      att-value         = *WSP option-tag-list 
      option-tag-list   = option-tag *(COMMA option-tag) 
      option-tag        = token    ; defined in [SDP] 
      COMMA             = *WSP "," *WSP  ; defined in [RFC4234] 

   Note that white-space is permitted before the option-tag-list. Also, 
   implementers familiar with SIP should note that the above definition 
   of COMMA differs from the one in [RFC3261].  

   A special base option tag with a value of "v0" is defined for the 
   basic SDP capability negotiation framework. Entities use this option 
   tag with the "a=csup" attribute to indicate support for the SDP 
   capability negotiation framework specified in this document.  

   The following examples illustrates the use of the "a=csup" attribute 
   with the "v0" option tags and two hypothetical option tags, "foo" and 
   "bar": 

    
 
 
Andreasen              Expires August 13, 2007                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

      a=csup: v0 
      a=csup: foo 
      a=csup: bar 
      a=csup: v0, foo, bar 

   The "a=csup" attribute can be provided at the session and the media-
   level. When provided at the session-level, it applies to the entire 
   SDP. When provided at the media-level, it applies to the media-stream 
   in question only (option-tags provided at the session level apply as 
   well). There can be one or more "a=csup" attributes at both the 
   session and media-level (one or more per media stream in the latter 
   case).  

   Whenever an entity that supports one or more extensions to the SDP 
   Capability Negotiation framework generates an SDP, it SHOULD include 
   the "a=csup" attribute with the option tags for the extensions it 
   supports at the session and/or media-level, unless those option tags 
   are already provided in one or more "a=creq" attribute (see Section 
   3.2.2. ) at the relevant levels. The base option tag MAY be included.  

3.2.2. Required Capability Negotiation Extension Attribute 

   The SDP Capability negotiation solution allows for capability 
   negotiation extensions to be defined. Associated with each such 
   extension is an option tag that identifies the extension in question. 
   Option-tags MUST be registered with IANA per the procedures defined 
   in Section 6.  

   The Required Capability Negotiation Extensions attribute ("a=creq") 
   contains a comma-separated list of option tags identifying the SDP 
   Capability negotiation extensions that MUST be supported by the 
   entity receiving the SDP in order for that entity to properly process 
   the SDP Capability negotiation. The attribute is defined as follows: 

      a=creq: <option-tag-list> 

   The "creq" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
   with an att-value defined as follows: 

      att-value         = *WSP option-tag-list 

   where "option-tag-list" is defined in Section 3.2.1.  Note that 
   white-space is permitted before the option-tag-list. 

   The following examples illustrate the use of the "a=creq" attribute 
   with the "v0" base option tag and two hypothetical option tags, "foo" 
   and "bar":

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

      a=creq: v0 
      a=creq: foo 
      a=creq: bar 
      a=creq: v0, foo, bar 

   The "a=creq" attribute can be provided at the session and the media-
   level. When provided at the session-level, it applies to the entire 
   SDP. When provided at the media-level, it applies to the media-stream 
   in question only (required option tags provided at the session level 
   apply as well). There can be one or more "a=creq" attributes at both 
   the session and media-level (one or more per media stream in the 
   latter case).  

   When an entity generates an SDP and it requires the recipient of that 
   SDP to support one or more SDP capability negotiation extensions in 
   order to properly process the SDP Capability negotiation, the 
   "a=creq" attribute MUST be included with option-tags that identify 
   the required extensions at the session and/or media level, unless it 
   is already known that the receiving entity supports those option-tags 
   at the relevant levels (in which case their inclusion is OPTIONAL).  

     An example of this is when generating an answer to an offer. If the 
     answerer supports the required option-tags from the offer, and the 
     answerer does not require any additional option-tags beyond what 
     was listed in either the required ("a=creq") or supported 
     ("a=csup")  attributes from the offer, then the answerer is not 
     required to include a required ("a=creq") attribute with any 
     option-tags that may need to be supported (such as the base option 
     tag - "v0"). 

   A recipient that receives an SDP and does not support one or more of 
   the required extensions listed in a "creq" attribute, MUST NOT 
   perform the SDP capability negotiation defined in this document. For 
   non-supported extensions provided at the session-level, this implies 
   that SDP capability negotiation MUST NOT be performed at all. For 
   non-supported extensions at the media-level, this implies that SDP 
   capability negotiation MUST NOT be performed for the media stream in 
   question.  

   When an entity does not support one or more required SDP capability 
   negotiation extensions, the entity SHOULD proceed as if the SDP 
   capability negotiation attributes were not included in the first 
   place, i.e. all the capability negotiation attributes should be 
   ignored.  In that case, the entity SHOULD include a "csup" attribute 
   listing the SDP capability negotiation extensions it actually 
   supports.

     This ensures that introduction of the SDP capability negotiation 
     mechanism does not introduce any new failure scenarios.  

   The above rules apply to the base option tag as well. Thus, entities 
   compliant to this specification MUST include a "creq" attribute (at 
   least in an offer) that includes the option tag "v0" as illustrated 
   below: 

      a=creq: v0 

3.3. Capability Attributes 

   In this section, we present the new attributes associated with 
   indicating the capabilities for use by the SDP Capability 
   negotiation. 

3.3.1. Attribute Capability Attribute 

   Attributes can be expressed as negotiable parameters by use of a new 
   attribute capability attribute ("a=acap"), which is defined as 
   follows: 

      a=acap: <att-cap-num> <att-par> 

   where <att-cap-num> is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both 
   included) used to number the attribute capability and <att-par> is an 
   attribute ("a=") in its full  '<type>=<value>' form (see [SDP]). 

   The "acap" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
   with an att-value defined as follows: 

      att-value   = *WSP att-cap-num 1*WSP att-par 
      att-cap-num = 1*DIGIT ;defined in [RFC4234] 
      att-par     = attribute  ;defined in RFC 4266 

   Note that white-space is permitted before the att-cap-num. The "acap" 
   attribute can be provided at the session level for session-level 
   attributes and the media level for media-level attributes. The "acap" 
   attribute MUST NOT be used to provide a media-level attribute at the 
   session-level or vice versa.  

   Each occurrence of the "acap" attribute in the entire session 
   description MUST use a different value of <att-cap-num>.   

     There is a need to be able to reference both session-level and 
     media-level attributes in potential configurations at the media

     level, and this provides for a simple solution to avoiding overlap 
     between the references (handles) to each attribute capability. 

   The <att-cap-num> values provided are independent of similar <cap-
   num> values provided for other capability attributes, i.e., they form 
   a separate name-space for attribute capabilities.  

   The following examples illustrate use of the "acap" attribute:  

      a=acap: 1 a=ptime:20 
    
      a=acap: 2 a=ptime:30 

      a=acap: 3 a=key-mgmt:mikey AQAFgM0XflABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsAyONQ6gAA 
      AAAGEEoo2pee4hp2UaDX8ZE22YwKAAAPZG9uYWxkQGR1Y2suY29tAQAAAAAAAQAk0
      JKpgaVkDaawi9whVBtBt0KZ14ymNuu62+Nv3ozPLygwK/GbAV9iemnGUIZ19fWQUO
      SrzKTAv9zV 
       
      a=acap: 4 a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32    
            inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32  

   The first two provide attribute values for the ptime attribute. The 
   third provides SRTP parameters by using MIKEY with the key-mgmt 
   attribute [KMGMT]. The fourth provides SRTP parameters by use of 
   security descriptions with the crypto attribute [SDES]. Note that the 
   line-wrapping and new-lines in example three and four are provided 
   for formatting reasons only - they are not permitted in actual SDP.  

     Readers familiar with RFC 3407 may notice the similarity between 
     the RFC 3407 "cpar" attribute and the above. There are however a 
     couple of important differences, most notably that the "acap" 
     attribute contains a handle that enables referencing it and it 
     furthermore supports attributes only (the "cpar" attribute defined 
     in RFC 3407 supports bandwidth information as well). The "acap" 
     attribute also is not automatically associated with any particular 
     capabilities.  

3.3.2. Transport Protocol Capability Attribute 

   Transport Protocols can be expressed as capabilities by use of a new 
   Transport Protocol Capability attribute ("a=tcap") defined as 
   follows: 

      a=tcap: <trpr-cap-num> <proto-list> 

   where <trpr-cap-num> is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both 
   included) used to number the transport address capability for later 
 
 
Andreasen              Expires August 13, 2007                [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   reference, and <proto-list> is one or more <proto>, separated by 
   white space, as defined in the SDP "m=" line.  

   The "tcap" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
   with an att-value defined as follows: 

      att-value      = *WSP trpr-cap-num 1*WSP proto-list 
      trpr-cap-num   = 1*DIGIT ;defined in [RFC4234] 
      proto-list     = proto *(1*WSP proto) ; defined in RFC 4566 

   Note that white-space is permitted before the trpr-cap-num. The 
   "tcap" attribute can be provided at the session- and media-level. 
   Each occurrence of the "tcap" attribute in the entire session 
   description MUST use a different value of <trpr-cap-num>.  When 
   multiple <proto> values are provided, the first one is associated 
   with the value <trpr-cap-num>, the second one with the value one 
   higher, etc. The <trpr-cap-num> values provided are independent of 
   similar <cap-num> values provided for other capability attributes, 
   i.e., they form a separate name-space for transport protocol 
   capabilities.  

   Below, we provide examples of the "a=tcap" attribute: 

      a=tcap: 1 RTP/AVP 
      a=tcap: 2 RTP/AVPF 
      a=tcap: 3 RTP/SAVP RTP/SAVPF 

   The first one provides a capability for the "RTP/AVP" profile defined 
   in [RFC3551] and the second one provides a capability for the RTP 
   with RTCP-Based Feedback profile defined in [AVPF]. The third one 
   provides capabilities for the "RTP/SAVP" and "RTP/SAVPF" profiles.  

   Transport capabilities are inherently included in the "m=" line, 
   however they still need to be specified explicitly in a "tcap" 
   attribute, if they are to be used as a capability. This may seem 
   redundant (and indeed it is from the offerer's point of view), 
   however it is done to protect against middle-boxes that may modify 
   "m=" lines while passing unknown attributes through. If an implicit 
   capability were used instead (e.g. a reserved transport capability 
   number could be used to refer to the transport protocol in the "m=" 
   line), and a middle-box were to modify the transport protocol in the 
   "m=" line (e.g. to translate between plain RTP and secure RTP), then 
   the potential configuration referencing that implicit transport 
   capability may no longer be correct. With explicit capabilities, we 
   avoid this pitfall, although the potential configuration preference 
   (see Section 3.4.1. ) may not reflect that of the middle-box (which 
   some may view as a feature).

3.4. Configuration Attributes 

3.4.1. Potential Configuration Attribute 

   Potential Configurations can be expressed by use of a new Potential 
   Configuration Attribute ("a=pcfg") defined as follows:  

      a=pcfg: <config-number> <pot-cfg-list> 

   where <config-number> is an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both 
   included).  

   The "pcfg" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
   with an att-value defined as follows: 

      att-value      = *WSP config-number 1*WSP pot-cfg-list 
      config-number  = 1*DIGIT ;defined in [RFC4234] 
      pot-cfg-list   = pot-config *(1*WSP pot-config) 
      pot-config     = pot-attribute-parameter-config / 
                       pot-transport-protocol-config / 
                       pot-extension-config 

   The missing productions are defined below. Note that white-space is 
   permitted before the config-number.  

   The potential configuration attribute can be provided at the media-
   level only. The attribute includes a configuration number, which is 
   an integer between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included). The configuration 
   number MUST be unique within the media stream. The configuration 
   number also indicates the relative preference of potential 
   configurations; lower numbers are preferred over higher numbers. 

   After the configuration number, one or more potential configuration 
   parameters MUST be provided. This document defines potential 
   attribute parameter configurations and potential transport protocol 
   configurations.  Each of these MUST NOT be present more than once in 
   a particular potential configuration attribute. Potential extension 
   configurations can be included as well; unknown potential extension 
   configurations MUST be ignored (if support is required, then the 
   "a=creq" with a suitable option tag should be used). There can be 
   more than one potential extension configuration, however each 
   particular potential extension configuration MUST NOT be present more 
   than once in a given potential configuration attribute. Together, 
   these values define a potential configuration.

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   There can be multiple potential configurations provided within a 
   media description. Each of these indicates not only a willingness, 
   but in fact a desire to use the potential configuration. 

   Attribute capabilities are included in a potential configuration by 
   use of the pot-attribute-parameter-config parameter, which is defined 
   by the following ABNF: 

      pot-attribute-parameter-config  
                        = "a=" acap-cap-list *(BAR acap-cap-list) 
      acap-cap-list     = att-cap-num *(COMMA att-cap-num) 
      att-cap-num       = 1*DIGIT   ;defined in [RFC4234] 
      BAR               = *WSP "|" *WSP  ; defined in [RFC4234] 

   Each potential attribute parameter configuration list is a comma-
   separated list of attribute capability numbers where att-cap-num 
   refers to attribute capability numbers defined above and hence MUST 
   be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included). Alternative potential 
   attribute parameter configurations are separated by a vertical bar 
   ("|"), the scope of which extends to the next alternative (i.e. "," 
   has higher precedence than "|"). The alternatives are ordered by 
   preference with the most preferred listed first.  

   Transport protocol capabilities are included in a potential 
   configuration by use of the pot-transport-protocol-config parameter, 
   which is defined by the following ABNF: 

      pot-transport-protocol-config =  
                           "t=" trpr-cap-num *(BAR trpr-cap-num) 
      trpr-cap-num        = 1*DIGIT   ; defined in [RFC4234] 

   The trpr-cap-num refers to transport protocol capability numbers 
   defined above and hence MUST be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included). 
   Alternative potential transport protocol configurations are separated 
   by a vertical bar ("|").  The alternatives are ordered by preference 
   with the most preferred listed first. When transport protocol 
   capabilities are not included in a potential configuration at the 
   media level, the transport protocol information from the associated 
   "m=" line will be used.  

     In the presence of middle-boxes (the existence of which may not be 
     known), care should be taken with assuming that the transport 
     protocol in the "m=" line will not be modified by a middle-box. Use 
     of an explicit capability will guard against the capability 
     indications of that.

   Extension capabilities can be included in a potential configuration 
   as well. Such extensions MUST adhere to the following ABNF: 

      pot-extension-config = ext-cap-name "="  
                                 ext-cap-list *(BAR ext-cap-list) 
      ext-cap-name   = token     ; defined in [SDP] 
      ext-cap-list   = ext-cap-num *(COMMA ext-cap-num) 
      ext-cap-num    = 1*DIGIT   ; defined in [RFC4234] 

   The ext-cap-name refers to the type of extension capability and the 
   ext-cap-num refers to a capability number associated with that 
   particular type of extension capability.  The number MUST be between 
   1 and 2^31-1 (both included).  Alternative potential extension 
   configurations for a particular extension are separated by a vertical 
   bar ("|"),the scope of which extends to the next alternative (i.e. 
   "," has higher precedence than "|").  Unsupported or unknown 
   potential extension configs MUST be ignored. 

     The "creq" attribute and its associated rules can be used to ensure 
     that required extensions are supported in the first place.  

   Potential configurations can be provided at the media level only, 
   however it is possible to reference capabilities provided at either 
   the session or media level. There are certain semantic rules and 
   restrictions associated with this:  

   A (media level) potential configuration in a given media description 
   MUST NOT reference a media-level capability provided in a different 
   media description; doing so invalidates that potential configuration. 
   A potential configuration can however reference a session-level 
   capability. The semantics of doing so (should that potential 
   configuration be chosen), depends on the type of capability. In the 
   case of transport capabilities, this has no particular implication. 
   In the case of attribute capabilities however, it does. More 
   specifically, the corresponding attribute value (provided within that 
   attribute capability) will be considered part of the active 
   configuration at the *session* level. In other words, it will be as-
   if that attribute was simply provided with that value at the session-
   level in the first place. Note that individual media streams perform 
   capability negotiation individually, and hence it is possible that 
   another media stream (where the attribute was part of a potential 
   configuration) chose a configuration without that session level 
   attribute. The session-level attribute however remains "active" and 
   hence applies to the entire session. It is up to the entity that 
   generates the SDP to ensure that in such cases, the resulting active 
   configuration SDP is still meaningful.  

 
 
Andreasen              Expires August 13, 2007                [Page 17] 

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   The session-level operation of extension capabilities is undefined: 
   Consequently, if session-level extension capabilities are defined, 
   they MUST specify the implication of making them part of an active 
   configuration at the media level.  

   Below, we provide an example of the "a=pcfg" attribute in a complete 
   media description in order to properly indicate the supporting 
   attributes: 

      v=0 
      o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      t=0 0 
      m=audio 3456 RTP/AVPF 0 18  
      a=creq: v0 
      a=acap:1 crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32    
         inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32  
      a=tcap: 1 RTP/AVPF RTP/AVP 
      a=tcap: 3 RTP/SAVP RTP/SAVPF 
      a=pcfg:1 t=4|3 a=1 
      a=pcfg:8 t=1|2 

   We have two potential configurations listed here. The first one (and 
   most preferred, since its configuration number is "1") indicates that 
   either of the profiles RTP/SAVPF or RTP/SAVP (specified by the 
   transport protocol capability numbers 4 and 3) can be supported with 
   attribute capability 1 (the "crypto" attribute); RTP/SAVPF is 
   preferred over RTP/SAVP since its capability number (4) is listed 
   first in the preferred potential configuration. The second potential 
   configuration indicates that the RTP/AVPF of RTP/AVP profile can be 
   used, with RTP/AVPF being the preferred one. This non secure RTP 
   alternative is the less preferred one since its configuration number 
   is "8".  

3.4.2. Actual Configuration Attribute 

   The actual configuration attribute identifies which of the potential 
   configurations from an offer SDP were used as actual configurations 
   in an answer SDP.  This is done by reference to the configuration 
   number and the attribute capabilities and transport protocol 
   capabilities from the offer that were actually used by the answerer 
   in his offer/answer procedure. If extension capabilities were used, 
   those will be included by reference as well. Note that the 
   configuration number and all capability numbers used are those from 
   the offer; not the answer.

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   The Actual Configuration Attribute ("a=acfg") is defined as follows:  

      a=acfg: <act-cfg-list> 

   The "acfg" attribute adheres to the RFC 4566 "attribute" production, 
   with an att-value defined as follows: 

      att-value      = *WSP config-number 1*WSP act-cfg-list 
                        ;config-number defined in Section 3.4.1.  
      act-cfg-list   =  capability *(1*WSP capability) 
      capability     =  act-attribute-parameter-config / 
                           act-transport-protocol-config / 
                           act-extension-config 
    
      act-attribute-parameter-config =  
               "a=" acap-cap-list   ; defined in Section 3.4.1.  
    
      act-transport-protocol-config = 
               "t=" trpr-cap-num    ; defined in Section 3.4.1.  
    
      act-extension-config = 
               ext-cap-name "=" ext-cap-list ; defined in Section 3.4.1.  

   Note that white-space is permitted before the config-number. The 
   actual configuration ("a=acfg") attribute can be provided at the  
   media-level only. There MUST NOT be more than one occurrence of an 
   actual configuration attribute within a given media description.  

   Below, we provide an example of the "a=acfg" attribute (building on 
   the previous example with the potential configuration attribute): 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      t=0 0 
      m=audio 4567 RTP/SAVPF 0  
      a=creq: 0 
      a=acfg:1 t=4 a=1 

   It indicates that the answerer used an offer consisting of potential 
   configuration number 1 with transport protocol capability 4 from the 
   offer (RTP/SAVPF) and attribute capability 1 (the "crypto" 
   attribute).

3.5. Offer/Answer Model Extensions 

   In this section, we define extensions to the offer/answer model 
   defined in [RFC3264] to allow for potential configurations to be 
   included in an offer, where they constitute offers that may be 
   accepted by the answerer instead of the actual configuration(s) 
   included in the "m=" line(s).  

      [EDITOR'S NOTE: Multicast considerations have been omitted for 
      now.] 

      TO DO: Elaborate and firm up offer/answer procedures. 

3.5.1. Generating the Initial Offer 

   An offerer that wants to use the SDP capability negotiation 
   extensions defined in this document MUST include the following in the 
   offer: 

   o  an SDP capability negotiation required extensions attribute ("a-
      creq") that contains the option tag "v0". It must either be 
      provided at the session-level or for each individual media stream. 
      Option tags for any other required extensions MUST be included as 
      well (in accordance with Section 3.2.2. ) 

   o  one or more attribute capability attributes (as defined in Section 
      3.3.1. ) if alternative attribute parameter values are to be 
      indicated as offerer capabilities or be negotiated. 

   o  one or more transport protocol capability attributes (as defined 
      in Section 3.3.2. ) if alternative transport protocols are to be 
      to be indicated as offerer capabilities or be negotiated. 

   o  one or more potential configuration attributes (as defined in 
      Section 3.4. ) if alternative potential configurations are to be 
      negotiated.  

   o  one or more required capability negotiation extension attributes 
      (as defined in Section 3.2.2. ), if the answerer is required to 
      support one or more SDP capability negotiation extensions.  

   The offerer SHOULD furthermore include the following:

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   o  one or more supported capability negotiation extension attributes 
      ("a=csup" as defined in Section 3.2.1. ), if the offerer supports 
      one or more SDP capability negotiation extensions that have not 
      been included in one or more "a=creq" attributes at the relevant 
      session and media level(s).  

   The capabilities provided merely indicate what the offerer is capable 
   of doing. They do not constitute a commitment or even an indication 
   to actually use them. This applies to potential configurations listed 
   at the session level as well. Conversely, each of the potential 
   configurations listed at the media level constitutes an alternative 
   offer which may be used to negotiate and establish the session.   

   The current actual configuration is included in the "m=" line (as 
   defined by [RFC3264]). Per [RFC3264], once the offerer generates the 
   offer, he must be prepared to receive incoming media in accordance 
   with that offer. That rule applies here as well, but for the actual 
   configurations only; media received by the offerer according to one 
   of the potential configurations MAY be discarded, until the offerer 
   receives an answer indicating what the actual configuration is. Once 
   that answer is received, incoming media MUST be processed in 
   accordance with the actual configuration indicated and the answer 
   received.   

3.5.2. Generating the Answer  

   When the answerer receives an offer with valid SDP capability 
   negotiation information in it and in particular with one or more 
   valid potential configuration information attributes present, it may 
   use any of the potential configurations as an alternative offer. A 
   potential configuration information attribute is valid if all of the 
   capabilities (attribute capabilities, transport protocol capabilities 
   and any extension capabilities) it references are present and valid 
   themselves.  

   The actual configuration is contained in the media description's "m=" 
   line. The answerer can send media to the offerer in accordance with 
   the actual configuration, however if it chooses to use one of the 
   alternative potential configurations, media sent to the offerer may 
   be discarded by the offerer until the answer is received.   

   If the answerer chooses to accept one of the alternative potential 
   configurations instead of the actual configuration, the answerer MUST 
   generate an answer as if the offer contained that potential 
   configuration instead of the actual configuration included. The 
   answerer MUST also include an actual configuration attribute in the 
   answer that identifies the potential configuration from the offer 
 
 
Andreasen              Expires August 13, 2007                [Page 21] 

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   used by the answerer. The actual configuration attribute in the 
   answer MUST include information about the attribute capabilities, 
   transport protocol parameters, and extension capabilities from the 
   potential configuration that were used to generate the answer.  

3.5.3.  Offerer Processing of the Answer  

   When the offerer included potential configurations for a media 
   stream, it MUST examine the answer for the presence of an actual 
   configuration attribute for each such media stream.  If the attribute 
   is missing, offerer processing of the answer MUST proceed as defined 
   by [RFC3264]. If the attribute is present, processing continues as 
   follows: 

   The actual configuration attribute specifies which of the potential 
   configurations were used by the answerer to generate the answer. This 
   includes all the types of capabilities from the potential 
   configuration offered, i.e. the attribute capabilities ("a=acap"), 
   transport protocol capabilities ("a=tcap"), and any extension 
   capability parameters included.  

   The offerer MUST now process the answer as if the offer had contained 
   the potential configuration as the actual configuration in the media 
   description ("m=" line) and relevant attributes in the offer.  

   If the answerer selected one of the potential configurations from the 
   offer as the actual configuration, then the offerer SHOULD perform 
   another offer/answer exchange, where the offer contains the selected 
   potential configuration as the actual configuration, i.e. with the 
   actual configuration used in the "m=" line and any other relevant 
   attributes. This second offer/answer exchange will not modify the 
   session anyway, however it will help intermediaries that look at the 
   SDP, but do not understand the capability negotiation extensions, to 
   understand the details of the negotiated media streams.  

3.5.4. Modifying the Session        

   Potential configurations may be included in subsequent offers as 
   defined in [RFC3264, Section 8].  The procedure for doing so is 
   similar to that described above with the answer including an 
   indication of the actual configuration used by the answerer.  

   If the answer indicates use of a potential configuration from the 
   offer, then a second offer/answer exchange using that potential 
   configuration as the actual configuration SHOULD be performed.

3.6. Interactions with ICE 

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [ICE] provides a 
   mechanism for verifying connectivity between two endpoints by sending 
   STUN messages directly between the media endpoints. The basic ICE 
   specification [ICE] is defined to support UDP-based connectivity 
   only, however it allows for extensions to support other transport 
   protocols, such as TCP, which is being specified in [ICETCP]. ICE 
   defines a new "a=candidate" attribute, which, among other things, 
   indicates the possible transport protocol(s) to use and then 
   associates a priority with each of them. The most preferred transport 
   protocol that *successfully* verifies connectivity will end up being 
   used.  

   When using ICE, it is thus possible that the transport protocol that 
   will be used differs from what is specified in the "m=" line. 
   Furthermore, since both ICE and SDP Capability Negotiation may now 
   specify alternative transport protocols, there is a potentially 
   unintended interaction when using these together.  

   We provide the following guidelines for addressing that.  

      [EDITOR'S NOTE: This requires more work] 

   There are two basic scenarios to consider here: 

   1) A particular media stream can run over different transport 
   protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP, or TCP/TLS), and the intent is simply to 
   use the one that works (in the preference order specified).  

   2) A particular media stream can run over different transport 
   protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP, or TCP/TLS) and the intent is to have the 
   negotiation process decide which one to use (e.g. T.38 over TCP or 
   UDP).  
    
   In scenario 1, there should be ICE "a=candidate" attributes for UDP, 
   TCP, etc. but otherwise nothing special in the potential 
   configuration attributes to indicate the desire to use different 
   transport protocols (e.g. UDP, or TCP). The ICE procedures 
   essentially cover the capability negotiation required (by having the 
   answerer select something it supports and then use of trial and 
   error).  
    
   Scenario 2 does not require a need to support or use ICE. Instead, we 
   simply use transport protocol capabilities and potential 
   configuration attributes to indicate the desired outcome.  

 
 
Andreasen              Expires August 13, 2007                [Page 23] 

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   The scenarios may be combined, e.g. by offering potential 
   configuration alternatives where some of them can support one 
   transport protocol only (e.g. UDP), whereas others can support 
   multiple transport protocols (e.g. UDP or TCP). In that case, the ICE 
   candidate attributes should be defined as attribute capabilities and 
   the relevant ones should then be included in the proper potential 
   configurations (for example candidate attributes for UDP only for 
   potential configurations that are restricted to UDP, whereas there 
   could be candidate attributes for UDP, TCP, and TCP/TLS for potential 
   configurations that can use all three). 

3.7. Processing Media before Answer 

   The offer/answer model requires an offerer to be able to receive 
   media in accordance with the offer prior to receiving the answer. 
   This property is retained with the SDP capability negotiation 
   extensions defined here, but only when the actual configuration is 
   selected by the answerer. If a potential configuration is chosen, it 
   is permissible for the offerer to not process any media received 
   before the answer is received. This however may lead to clipping.  

   In the case of SIP, this issue could be solved easily by defining a 
   precondition [RFC3312] for capability negotiation, however 
   preconditions are viewed as complicated to implement and they add to 
   overall session establishment delay by requiring an extra 
   offer/answer exchange. An alternative is therefore desirable.  

   The SDP capability negotiation framework does not define such an 
   alternative, however extensions may do so. For example, one technique 
   proposed for best-effort SRTP in [BESRTP] is to provide different RTP 
   payload type mappings for different transport protocols used. The 
   basic SDP capability negotiation framework defined here does not 
   include the ability to do so, however extensions that enable that may 
   be defined.  

4. Examples 

   In this section, we provide examples showing how to use the SDP 
   Capability Negotiation.  

4.1. Best-Effort Secure RTP 

   The following example illustrates how to use the SDP Capability 
   negotiation extensions to support so-called Best-Effort Secure RTP. 
   In that scenario, the offerer supports both RTP and Secure RTP. If 
   the answerer does not support secure RTP (or the SDP capability 
   negotiation extensions), an RTP session will be established. However, 
 
 
Andreasen              Expires August 13, 2007                [Page 24] 

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   if the answerer supports Secure RTP and the SDP Capability 
   Negotiation extensions, a Secure RTP session will be established.  

   The best-effort Secure RTP negotiation is illustrated by the 
   offer/answer exchange below, where Alice sends an offer to Bob:  

                Alice                               Bob 

                  | (1) Offer (SRTP and RTP)         | 
                  |--------------------------------->| 
                  |                                  | 
                  | (2) Answer (SRTP)                | 
                  |<---------------------------------| 
                  |                                  | 
                  | (3) Offer (SRTP)                 | 
                  |--------------------------------->| 
                  |                                  | 
                  | (4) Answer (SRTP)                | 
                  |<---------------------------------| 
                  |                                  | 
    

   Alice's offer includes RTP and SRTP as alternatives. RTP is the 
   default, but SRTP is the preferred one: 

      v=0 
      o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      t=0 0

      a=tcap:1 RTP/SAVP RTP/AVP

         FEC_ORDER=FEC_SRTP 
      a=pcfg:1 t=1 a=1 
       
   The "m=" line indicates that Alice is offering to use plain RTP with 
   PCMU or G.729.  Alice indicates that support for the base protocol 
   defined here is required by including the "a=creq" attribute 
   containing the value "v0". The capabilities are provided by the 
   "a=tcap" and "a=acap" attributes.  The "tcap" capability indicates 
   that both Secure RTP and normal RTP are supported. The "acap" 
   attribute provides a capability parameter with a handle of 1. The 
   capability parameter is a "crypto" attribute, which provides the 
   keying material for SRTP using SDP security descriptions [SDES]. The

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   "a=pcfg" attribute provides the potential configurations included in 
   the offer by reference to the capabilities.  A single potential 
   configuration with a configuration number of "1" is provided. It 
   includes is transport protocol capability 1 (RTP/SAVP, i.e. secure 
   RTP) together with the attribute capability 1, i.e. the crypto 
   attribute provided.   

   Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports SRTP and the SDP 
   Capability Negotiation extensions, and hence he accepts the potential 
   configuration for Secure RTP provided by Alice: 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.2

      m=audio 4567 RTP/SAVP 0 18  
      a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80 
            inline:PS1uQCVeeCFCanVmcjkpPywjNWhcYD0mXXtxaVBR|2^20|1:4
      a=acfg:1 t=1 a=1 

   Bob includes the "a=acfg" attribute in the answer to inform Alice 
   that he based his answer on an offer containing the potential 
   configuration with transport protocol capability 1 and attribute 
   capability 1 from the offer SDP (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile using the 
   keying material provided).  Bob also includes his keying material in 
   a crypto attribute.  

   When Alice receives Bob's answer, session negotiation has completed, 
   however Alice nevertheless generates a new offer using the actual 
   configuration. This is done purely to assist any middle-boxes that 
   may reside between Alice and Bob but do not support the capability 
   negotiation extensions (and hence may not understand the negotiation 
   that just took place):  

   Alice's updated offer includes only SRTP, and it is not using the SDP 
   capability negotiation extensions (Alice could have included the 
   capabilities as well is she wanted to):  

      v=0 
      o=- 25678 753850 IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.1 
      t=0 0 
      m=audio 3456 RTP/SAVP 0 18  
      a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80

         FEC_ORDER=FEC_SRTP 

   The "m=" line now indicates that Alice is offering to use secure RTP 
   with PCMU or G.729.  The "crypto" attribute, which provides the SRTP 
   keying material, is included with the same value again.  

   Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice, which he accepts, and then 
   generates an answer to Alice: 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621815 IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.2

            inline:PS1uQCVeeCFCanVmcjkpPywjNWhcYD0mXXtxaVBR|2^20|1:4 

   Bob includes the same crypto attribute as before, and the session 
   proceeds without change. Although Bob did not include any 
   capabilities in his answer, he could of course have done so if he 
   wanted to.  

   Note that in this particular example, the answerer supported the 
   capability extensions defined here, however had he not, the answerer 
   would simply have ignored the new attributes received in step 1 and 
   accepted the offer to use normal RTP. In that case, the following 
   answer would have been generated in step 2 instead: 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      t=0 0 
      m=audio 4567 RTP/AVP 0 18  
    

4.2. Multiple Transport Protocols 

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Example to be updated - old copy below] 

   The following example illustrates how to use the SDP Capability 
   negotiation extensions to support so-called Best-Effort Secure RTP. 
   In that scenario, the offerer supports both RTP and Secure RTP. If 
   the answerer does not support secure RTP (or the SDP capability 
   negotiation extensions), an RTP session will be established. However,

   if the answerer supports Secure RTP and the SDP Capability 
   Negotiation extensions, a Secure RTP session will be established.  

   The best-effort Secure RTP negotiation is illustrated by the 
   offer/answer exchange below, where Alice sends an offer to Bob:  

                Alice                               Bob

   Alice's offer includes RTP and SRTP as alternatives. RTP is the 
   default, but SRTP is the preferred one:

      a=pcfg:5 t=1 a=1 
      a=pcfg:10 t=2  
       
   The "m=" line indicates that Alice is offering to use plain RTP with 
   PCMU or G.729.  Alice indicates that support for the base protocol 
   defined here is required by including the "a=creq" attribute 
   containing the value "v0". The capabilities are provided by the 
   "a=tcap" and "a=acap" attributes.  The capabilities indicate that 
   both Secure RTP and normal RTP are supported. The "acap" attribute 
   provides a capability parameter with a handle of 1. The capability 
   parameter is a "crypto" attribute in the capability set, which 
   provides the keying material for SRTP using SDP security descriptions 
   [SDES]. The "a=pcfg" attribute provides the potential configurations 
   included in the offer by reference to the capabilities.  Two

   alternatives are provided; the first one with preference "5" (and 
   hence the preferred one since the preference on the second one is 
   "10") is transport protocol capability 1 (RTP/SAVP, i.e. secure RTP) 
   together with the attribute capability 1, i.e. the crypto attribute 
   provided. The second one is using transport protocol capability 2. 
   Note that we could have omitted the second potential configuration 
   since it equals the actual configuration (which is always the least 
   preferred configuration).  

   Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports SRTP and the SDP 
   Capability Negotiation extensions, and hence he accepts the potential 
   configuration for Secure RTP provided by Alice: 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 128.96.41.2

      a=csup: foo 
      a=acfg:1 t=1 a=1 

   Bob includes the "a=acfg" attribute in the answer to inform Alice 
   that he based his answer on an offer containing the potential 
   configuration with transport protocol capability 1 and attribute 
   capability 1 from the offer SDP (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile using the 
   keying material provided).  Bob also includes his keying material in 
   a crypto attribute. Finally, Bob supports an SDP capability 
   negotiation extension with the option tag "foo" and hence he includes 
   the "a=csup" parameter containing value "foo" in the answer.  

    

   Note that in this particular example, the answerer supported the 
   capability extensions defined here, however had he not, the answerer 
   would simply have ignored the new attributes and accepted the offer 
   to use normal RTP. In that case, the following answer would have been 
   generated instead: 

      v=0 
      o=- 24351 621814 IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      s=  
      c=IN IP4 128.96.41.2 
      t=0 0

8. Acknowledgments 

   This document is heavily influenced by the discussions and work done 
   by the SDP Capability Negotiation Design team. The following people 
   in particular provided useful comments and suggestions to either the 
   document itself or the overall direction of the solution defined in 
   here: Roni Even, Robert Gilman, Cullen Jennings, Matt Lepinski, Joerg 
   Ott, Colin Perkins, and Thomas Stach.

   Francois Audet and Dan Wing provided useful comments on earlier 
   versions of this document. 

9. Change Log 

9.1. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-02 

   The following are the major changes compared to version -01: 

   o  Potential configurations are no longer allowed at the session 
      level 

   o  Renamed capability attributes ("capar" to "acap" and "ctrpr" to 
      "tcap") 

   o  Changed name and semantics of the initial number (now called 
      configuration number) in potential configuration attributes; must 
      now be unique and can be used as a handle 

   o  Actual configuration attribute now includes configuration number 
      from the selected potential configuration attribute 

   o  Added ABNF throughout 

   o  Specified that answerer should include "a=csup" in case of 
      unsupported required extensions in offer. 

   o  Specified use of second offer/answer exchange when answerer 
      selected a potential configuration 

   o  Updated rules (and added restrictions) for referencing media- and 
      session-level capabilities in potential configurations (at the 
      media level) 

   o  Added initial section on ICE interactions 

   o  Added initial section on receiving media before answer 

9.2. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-01 

   The following are the major changes compared to version -00: 

   o  Media capabilities are no longer considered a core capability and 
      hence have been removed. This leaves transport protocols and 
      attributes as the only capabilities defined by the core.

Internet-Draft        SDP Capability Negotiation          February 2007 
    

   o  Version attribute has been removed and an option tag to indicate 
      the actual version has been defined instead. 

   o  Clarified rules for session-level and media level attributes 
      provided at either level as well how they can be used in potential 
      configurations.  

   o  Potential configuration parameters no longer have implicit 
      ordering; an explicit preference indicator is now included. 

   o  The parameter name for transport protocols in the potential and 
      actual configuration attributes have been changed "p" to "t".  

   o  Clarified operator precedence within potential and actual 
      configuration attributes.  

   o  Potential configurations at the session level now limited to 
      indicate latent capability configurations. Consequently, an actual 
      configuration attribute can no longer be provided at the session 
      level.  

   o  Cleaned up capability and potential configuration terminology - 
      they are now two clearly different things.  

9.3. draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-00 

   Version 00 is the initial version. The solution provided in this 
   initial version is based on an earlier (individual submission) 
   version of [SDPCapNeg]. The following are the major changes compared 
   to that document: 

   o  Solution no longer based on RFC 3407, but defines a set of similar 
      attributes (with some differences). 

   o  Various minor changes to the previously defined attributes. 

   o  Multiple transport capabilities can be included in a single "tcap" 
      attribute 

   o  A version attribute is now included. 

   o  Extensions to the framework are formally supported. 

   o  Option tags and the ability to list supported and required 
      extensions are supported.  

   o  A best-effort SRTP example use case has been added.

   o  Some terminology change throughout to more clearly indicate what 
      constitutes capabilities and what constitutes configurations.
