1.  Introduction

   When developing a video codec, changes and additions to the codec
   need to be decided based on their performance tradeoffs.  In
   addition, measurements are needed to determine when the codec has met
   its performance goals.  This document specifies how the tests are to
   be carried about to ensure valid comparisons when evaluating changes
   under consideration.  Authors of features or changes should provide
   the results of the appropriate test when proposing codec
   modifications.

2.  Subjective quality tests

   Subjective testing is the preferable method of testing video codecs.

   Because the IETF does not have testing resources of its own, it has
   to rely on the resources of its participants.  For this reason, even
   if the group agrees that a particular test is important, if no one
   volunteers to do it, or if volunteers do not complete it in a timely
   fashion, then that test should be discarded.  This ensures that only
   important tests be done in particular, the tests that are important
   to participants.

2.1.  Still Image Pair Comparison

   A simple way to determine superiority of one compressed image over
   another is to visually compare two compressed images, and have the
   viewer judge which one has a higher quality.  This is mainly used for
   rapid comparisons during development.  For this test, the two
   compressed images should have similar compressed file sizes, with one
   image being no more than 5% larger than the other.  In addition, at
   least 5 different images should be compared.

2.2.  Subjective viewing test

   A subjective viewing test is the preferred method of evaluating the
   quality.  The subjective test should be performed as either
   consecutively showing the video sequences on one screen or on two
   screens located side-by-side.  The testing procedure should normally
   follow rules described in [BT500] and be performed with non-expert
   test subjects.  The result of the test could be (depending on the
   test procedure) mean opinion scores (MOS) or differential mean
   opinion scores (DMOS).  Normally, confidence intervals are also
   calculated to judge whether the difference between two encodings is
   statistically significant.

2.3.  Expert viewing

   An expert viewing test can be performed in the case when an answer to
   a particular question should be found.  An example of such test can
   be a test involving video coding experts on evaluation of a
   particular problem, for example such as comparing the results of two
   de-ringing filters.  Depending on what information is sought, the
   appropriate test procedure can be chosen.

3.  Objective Metrics

Internet-Draft Video Codec Testing and Quality Measurement    March 2016


   Objective metrics are used in place of subjective metrics for easy
   and repeatable experiments.  Most objective metrics have been
   designed to correlate with subjective scores.

   The following descriptions give an overview of the operation of each
   of the metrics.  Because implementation details can sometimes vary,
   the exact implementation is specified in C in the Daala tools
   repository [DAALA-GIT].

   Unless otherwise specified, all of the metrics described below only
   apply to the luma plane, individually by frame.  When applied to the
   video, the scores of each frame are averaged to create the final
   score.

   Codecs are allowed to internally use downsampling, but must include a
   normative upsampler, so that the metrics run at the same resolution
   as the source video.  In addition, some metrics, such as PSNR and
   FASTSSIM, have poor behavior on downsampled images, so it must be
   noted in test results if downsampling is in effect.

3.1.  Overall PSNR

   PSNR is a traditional signal quality metric, measured in decibels.
   It is directly drived from mean square error (MSE), or its square
   root (RMSE).  The formula used is:

   20 * log10 ( MAX / RMSE )

   or, equivalently:

   10 * log10 ( MAX^2 / MSE )

   where the error is computed over all the pixels in the video, which
   is the method used in the dump_psnr.c reference implementation.

   This metric may be applied to both the luma and chroma planes, with
   all planes reported separately.

3.2.  Frame-averaged PSNR

   PSNR can also be calculated per-frame, and then the values averaged
   together.  This is reported in the same way as overall PSNR.

3.3.  PSNR-HVS-M

   The PSNR-HVS metric performs a DCT transform of 8x8 blocks of the
   image, weights the coefficients, and then calculates the PSNR of
   those coefficients.  Several different sets of weights have been
   considered.  [PSNRHVS] The weights used by the dump_pnsrhvs.c tool in
   the Daala repository have been found to be the best match to real MOS
   scores.

3.4.  SSIM

   SSIM (Structural Similarity Image Metric) is a still image quality
   metric introduced in 2004 [SSIM].  It computes a score for each
   individual pixel, using a window of neighboring pixels.  These scores
   can then be averaged to produce a global score for the entire image.
   The original paper produces scores ranging between 0 and 1.

   For the metric to appear more linear on BD-rate curves, the score is
   converted into a nonlinear decibel scale:

   -10 * log10 (1 - SSIM)

3.5.  Multi-Scale SSIM

   Multi-Scale SSIM is SSIM extended to multiple window sizes [MSSSIM].

3.6.  Fast Multi-Scale SSIM

   Fast MS-SSIM is a modified implementation of MS-SSIM which operates
   on a limited number of scales and with modified weights [FASTSSIM].
   The final score is converted to decibels in the same manner as SSIM.

3.7.  CIEDE2000

   CIEDE2000 is a metric based on CIEDE color distances [CIEDE2000].  It
   generates a single score taking into account all three chroma planes.
   It does not take into consideration any structural similarity or
   other psychovisual effects.

3.8.  VMAF

   Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion (VMAF) is a full-reference
   perceptual video quality metric that aims to approximate human
   perception of video quality [VMAF].  This metric is focused on
   quality degradation due compression and rescaling.  VMAF estimates
   the perceived quality score by computing scores from multiple quality
   assessment algorithms, and fusing them using a support vector machine
   (SVM).  Currently, three image fidelity metrics and one temporal

   signal have been chosen as features to the SVM, namely Anti-noise SNR
   (ANSNR), Detail Loss Measure (DLM), Visual Information Fidelity
   (VIF), and the mean co-located pixel difference of a frame with
   respect to the previous frame.

4.  Comparing and Interpreting Results

4.1.  Graphing

   When displayed on a graph, bitrate is shown on the X axis, and the
   quality metric is on the Y axis.  For publication, the X axis should
   be linear.  The Y axis metric should be plotted in decibels.  If the
   quality metric does not natively report quality in decibels, it
   should be converted as described in the previous section.

4.2.  Bjontegaard

   The Bjontegaard rate difference, also known as BD-rate, allows the
   measurement of the bitrate reduction offered by a codec or codec
   feature, while maintaining the same quality as measured by objective
   metrics.  The rate change is computed as the average percent
   difference in rate over a range of qualities.  Metric score ranges
   are not static - they are calculated either from a range of bitrates
   of the reference codec, or from quantizers of a third, reference
   codec.  Given a reference codec, test codec, and ranges, BD-rate
   values are calculated as follows:

   o  Rate/distortion points are calculated for the reference and test
      codec.  There need to be enough points so that at least four
      points lie within the quality levels.

   o  The rates are converted into log-rates.

   o  A piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial is fit to the
      points for each codec to produce functions of distortion in terms
      of log-rate.

   o  Metric score ranges are computed.

      *  If using a bitrate range, metric score ranges are computed by
         converting the rate bounds into log-rate and then looking up
         scores of the reference codec using the interpolating
         polynomial.

      *  If using a quantizer range, a third anchor codec is used to
         generate metric scores for the quantizer bounds.  The anchor
         codec makes the range immune to quantizer changes.

Internet-Draft Video Codec Testing and Quality Measurement    March 2016


   o  The log-rate is numerically integrated over the metric range for
      each curve.

   o  The resulting integrated log-rates are converted back into linear
      rate, and then the percent difference is calculated from the
      reference to the test codec.

4.3.  Ranges

   For all tests described in this document, quantizers of an anchor
   codec are used to determine the quality ranges.  The anchor codec
   used for ranges is libvpx 1.5.0 run with VP9 and High Latency CQP
   settings.  The quality range used is that achieved between cq-level
   20 and 60.

5.  Test Sequences

5.1.  Sources

   Lossless test clips are preferred for most tests, because the
   structure of compression artifacts in already-compressed clips may
   introduce extra noise in the test results.  However, a large amount
   of content on the internet needs to be recompressed at least once, so
   some sources of this nature are useful.  The encoder should run at
   the same bit depth as the original source.  In addition, metrics need
   to support operation at high bit depth.  If one or more codecs in a
   comparison do not support high bit depth, sources need to be
   converted once before entering the encoder.

5.2.  Test Sets

   Sources are divided into several categories to test different
   scenarios the codec will be required to operate in.  For easier
   comparison, all videos in each set should have the same color
   subsampling, same resolution, and same number of frames.  In
   addition, all test videos must be publicly available for testing use,
   to allow for reproducibility of results.  All current test sets are
   available for download [TESTSEQUENCES].

   o  Still images are useful when comparing intra coding performance.
      Xiph.org has four sets of lossless, one megapixel images that have
      been converted into YUV 4:2:0 format.  There are four sets that
      can be used:

      *  subset1 (50 images)

      *  subset2 (50 images)

      *  subset3 (1000 images)

      *  subset4 (1000 images)

   o  video-hd-3, a set that consists of 1920x1080 clips from
      [DERFVIDEO] (1500 frames total)

   o  vc-360p-1, a low quality video conferencing set (2700 frames
      total)

   o  vc-720p-1, a high quality video conferencing set (2750 frames
      total)

   o  netflix-4k-1, a cinematic 4K video test set (2280 frames total)

   o  netflix-2k-1, a 2K scaled version of netflix-4k-1 (2280 frames
      total)

   o  twitch-1, a game sequence set (2280 frames total)

5.3.  Operating Points

   Four operating modes are defined.  High latency is intended for on
   demand streaming, one-to-many live streaming, and stored video.  Low
   latency is intended for videoconferencing and remote access.  Both of
   these modes come in CQP and unconstrained variants.  When testing
   still image sets, such as subset1, high latency CQP mode should be
   used.

5.3.1.  Common settings

   Encoders should be configured to their best settings when being
   compared against each other:

   o  vp10: -codec=vp10 -ivf -frame-parallel=0 -tile-columns=0 -cpu-
      used=0 -threads=1

5.3.2.  High Latency CQP

   High Latency CQP is used for evaluating incremental changes to a
   codec.  It should not be used to compare unrelated codecs to each
   other.  It allows codec features with intrinsic frame delay.

   o  daala: -v=x -b 2

   o  vp9: -end-usage=q -cq-level=x -lag-in-frames=25 -auto-alt-ref=2

   o  vp10: -end-usage=q -cq-level=x -lag-in-frames=25 -auto-alt-ref=2

Internet-Draft Video Codec Testing and Quality Measurement    March 2016


5.3.3.  Low Latency CQP

   Low Latency CQP is used for evaluating incremental changes to a
   codec.  It should not be used to compare unrelated codecs to each
   other.  It requires the codec to be set for zero intrinsic frame
   delay.

   o  daala: -v=x

   o  vp10: -end-usage=q -cq-level=x -lag-in-frames=0

5.3.4.  Unconstrained High Latency

   The encoder should be run at the best quality mode available, using
   the mode that will provide the best quality per bitrate (VBR or
   constant quality mode).  Lookahead and/or two-pass are allowed, if
   supported.  One parameter is provided to adjust bitrate, but the
   units are arbitrary.  Example configurations follow:

   o  x264: -crf=x

   o  x265: -crf=x

   o  daala: -v=x -b 2

   o  vp10: -end-usage=q -cq-level=x -lag-in-frames=25 -auto-alt-ref=2

5.3.5.  Unconstrained Low Latency

   The encoder should be run at the best quality mode available, using
   the mode that will provide the best quality per bitrate (VBR or
   constant quality mode), but no frame delay, buffering, or lookahead
   is allowed.  One parameter is provided to adjust bitrate, but the
   units are arbitrary.  Example configurations follow:

   o  x264: -crf-x -tune zerolatency

   o  x265: -crf=x -tune zerolatency

   o  daala: -v=x

   o  vp10: -end-usage=q -cq-level=x -lag-in-frames=0

6.  Automation

   Frequent objective comparisons are extremely beneficial while
   developing a new codec.  Several tools exist in order to automate the
   process of objective comparisons.  The Compare-Codecs tool allows BD-
   rate curves to be generated for a wide variety of codecs
   [COMPARECODECS].  The Daala source repository contains a set of
   scripts that can be used to automate the various metrics used.  In
   addition, these scripts can be run automatically utilizing
   distributed computers for fast results, with the AreWeCompressedYet
   tool [AWCY].  Because of computational constraints, several levels of
   testing are specified.

6.1.  Regression tests

   Regression tests run on a small number of short sequences.  The
   regression tests should include a number of various test conditions.
   The purpose of regression tests is to ensure bug fixes (and similar
   patches) do not negatively affect the performance.  The anchor in
   regression tests is the previous revision of the codec in source
   control.  Regression tests are run on the following sets, in both
   high and low latency CQP modes:

   o  vc-720p-1

   o  netflix-2k-1

6.2.  Objective performance tests

   Changes that are expected to affect the quality of encode or
   bitstream should run an objective performance test.  The performance
   tests should be run on a wider number of sequences.  If the option
   for the objective performance test is chosen, wide range and full
   length simulations are run on the site and the results (including all
   the objective metrics) are generated.  Objective performance tests
   are run on the following sets, in both high and low latency CQP
   modes:

   o  video-hd-3

   o  netflix-2k-1

   o  netflix-4k-1

   o  vc-720p-1

   o  vc-360p-1

   o  twitch-1

6.3.  Periodic tests

   Periodic tests are run on a wide range of bitrates in order to gauge
   progress over time, as well as detect potential regressions missed by
   other tests.
