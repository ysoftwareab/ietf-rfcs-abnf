        Export of MPLS Segment Routing Label Type Information in
                   IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
                draft-tgraf-ipfix-mpls-sr-label-type-00

Abstract

   This document introduces two additional values in the Information
   Element mplsTopLabelType for IS-IS and OSPF MPLS Segment Routing (SR)
   extensions to enable Segment Routing label type information in IP
   Flow Information Export (IPFIX).

1.  Introduction

   Besides existing MPLS controlplane protocols such as BGP-4 [RFC8277],
   LDP [RFC5036] and BGP VPN [RFC4364], IS-IS Extensions
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions] and OSPF Extensions
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] had been added to
   propagate Segment Routing labels for the MPLS dataplane
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].

   Traffic Accounting in Segment Routing Networks
   [I-D.ali-spring-sr-traffic-accounting] describes how IPFIX can be
   laveraged to account traffic to MPLS Segment Routing label dimensions
   within a Segment Routing domain.

   In the Information Model for IP Flow Information Export IPFIX
   [RFC5102], the information element #46 mplsTopLabelType describes
   which MPLS controlplane protocol allocated the top-of-stack label in
   the MPLS label stack.  RFC 7012 section 7.2 [RFC7012] describes the
   IANA Information Element #46 SubRegistry [IANA-IPFIX-IE46] where new
   values should be added.

   By introducing two new values to information element #46
   mplsTopLabelType for IS-IS and OSPF, when Segment Routing with one of
   these two routing protocols is deployed, we get inisghts which
   traffic is being forwarded based on which MPLS controlplane protocol.
   A typical use case scenario is to monitor MPLS controlplane
   migrations from LDP to IS-IS or OSPF

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies two additional values for IS-IS and OSPF
   Segment Routing extension in the Information Element #46 at IP Flow
   Information Export (IPFIX).
