Abstract

   An increasing proportion of multimedia communication applications,
   including real-time interactive voice and video, are transported over
   Wi-Fi networks (i.e., wireless local area networks following IEEE
   802.11 standards) today.  It is therefore important to evaluate
   candidate congestion control schemes designed in the RMCAT Working
   Group over test cases that include Wi-Fi access links.  This draft
   serves such a purpose, and is complementary to
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-test] and
   [I-D.draft-sarker-rmcat-cellular-eval-test-cases]

1.  Introduction

   Given the prevalence of Internet access links over Wi-Fi, it is
   important to evaluate candidate RMCAT congestion control solutions
   over Wi-Fi test cases.  Such evaluations should also highlight the
   inherent different characteristics of Wi-Fi networks in contrast to
   Wired networks:

   o  The wireless radio channel is subject to interference from nearby
      transmitters, multipath fading, and shadowing, causing

      fluctuations in link throughput and sometimes an error-prone
      communication environment

   o  Available network bandwidth is not only shared over the air
      between cocurrent users, but also between uplink and downlink
      traffic due to the half duplex nature of wireless transmission
      medium.

   o  Packet transmessions over Wi-Fi are susceptible to contentions and
      collisions over the air.  Consequently, traffic load beyond a
      certain utilization level over a Wi-Fi network can introduce
      frequent collisions and significant network overhead.  This, in
      turn, leads to excessive delay, retransmission, loss and lower
      effective bandwidth for applications.

   o  The IEEE 802.11 standard (i.e., Wi-Fi) supports multi-rate
      transmission capabilities by dynamically choosing the most
      appropriate modulation scheme for a given received singal
      strength.  A different choice of Physical-layer rate will lead to
      different application-layer throughput.

   o  Presence of legancy 802.11b networks can significantly slow down
      the the rest of a modern Wi-Fi Network, since it takes longer to
      transmit the same packet over a slower link than over a faster
      link.  [Editor's note: maybe include a reference here instead.]

   o  Handover from one Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) to another may cause
      packet delay and loss.

   o  IEEE 802.11e defined EDCA/WMM (Enhanced DCF Channel Access/Wi-Fi
      Multi-Media) to give voice and video streams higher priority over
      pure data applications (e.g., file transfers).

   As we can see here, presence of Wi-Fi network in different different
   network topologies and traffic arrival can exert different impact on
   the network performance in terms of video transport rate, packet loss
   and delay that, in turn, effect end-to-end real-time multimedia
   congestion control.

   Currently, the most widely used IEEE 802.11 standards are 802.11g and
   802.11n.  The industry is moving towards 802.11ac and, potentially,
   802.11ad.  IEEE 802.11b is legency standard, and 802.11a has not been
   widely adopted.  Throughout this draft, unless otherwise mentioned,
   test cases are described using 802.11g mostly due to its wide
   availability both in test equipments and network simulation platform.
   Whenever possible, it is recommended to extend some of the
   experiments to 802.11ac so as to reflect a more mordent Wi-Fi network
   setting.

Internet-Draft      RMCAT Wi-Fi Evaluation Test Cases          July 2015


   Since Wi-Fi network normally connects to a wired infrastructure,
   either the wired network or the Wi-Fi network could be the
   bottleneck.  In the following section, we describe basic test cases
   for both scenarios separately.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Test Scenarios with Wired Bottlenecks

   The test scenarios below are intended to mimic the set up of video
   conferencing over Wi-Fi connections from the home.  Typically, the
   Wi-Fi home network is not congested and the bottleneck is present
   over the wired home access link.  Although it is expected that test
   evaluation results from this section are similar to those from the
   all-wired test cases (draft-sarker-rmcat-eval-test), it is worthwhile
   to run through these tests as sanity checks.

3.1.  Single RMCAT Flow over Wired Bottleneck

   This test case is designed to measure the responsiveness of the
   candidate algorithm when the Wi-Fi hop of the connection is
   uncongested.

   Figure 1 illustrates topology of this test.

   o  Path characteristics:

      *  Uplink capacity: 1Mbps

      *  One-Way propagation delay: 50ms.

      *  Maximum end-to-end jitter: 30ms

      *  Bottleneck queue type: Drop tail.

      *  Bottleneck queue size: 300ms.

      *  Path loss ratio: 0%.

   o  Application-related:

      *  Media Traffic:

         +  Media type: Video

         +  Media direction: forward.

         +  Number of media sources: One (1)

         +  Media timeline:

            -  Start time: 0s.

            -  End time: 99s.

      *  Competing traffic:

         +  Number of sources : Zero (0)

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   path capacity constraint, converges to bottleneck link's capacity and
   adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation when the sending bit
   rate is approaching the bottleneck link's capacity.  Oscillations
   occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate,
   overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck capacity, to rectify
   it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp up again.

3.2.  Bidirectional RMCAT Flow over Wired Bottleneck

   This test case is designed to evaluate performance of the candidate
   algorithm when lack of enough feedback.

      *  One-Way propagation delay: 50ms.

      *  Competing traffic:

   Expected behavior: It is expected that the candidate algorithms is
   able to cope with the lack/noise of feedback information and adapt to
   minimize the performance degradation of media flows in the forward
   channel.

3.3.  RMCAT Flow Competing with Long TCP over Wired Bottleneck

   This test case is designed to measure the performance of the
   candidate algorithm when lack of enough feedback.

      *  Media Traffic:

         +  Types of sources : long-lived TCP

         +  Number of sources: One (1)

         +  Traffic direction : forward

         +  Congestion control: Default TCP congestion control [TBD].

         +  Traffic timeline:

            -  Start time: 0s.

            -  End time: 119s.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm should be able to avoid
   congestion collapse, and get fair share of the bandwidth.  In the
   worst case, the media stream will fall to the minimum media bit rate.

4.  Bottleneck over Wireless Network

   These test cases assume that the wired portion along the media path
   are well-provisioned.  The bottleneck is in the Wi-Fi network over
   wireless.  This is to mimic the enterprise/coffee-house scenarios.

4.1.  Adaptive rate selection with single RMCAT flow

   Since morden IEEE 802.11 standards supports far higher data rates
   than the maximum requirements of individual RMCAT flows, in this test
   the legacy standard 802.11b is chosen to test the single RMCAT flow
   case. 802.11b Adaptive rate selection can operate at 11 Mbps in terms
   of PHY-layer transmission rate, and falls back to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps,
   and 1 Mbps when the wireless client moves away from the access point.

   Expected behavior: The rate adaptation algorithm run at application
   level should follow the adaptation in 802.11 mac layer.

4.2.  Multiple RMCAT Flows Sharing the Wireless Downlink

   This test case is for studying the impact of contention on competing
   RMCAT flows.  Specifications for IEEE 802.11g with a physical-layer
   transmission rate of 54 Mbps is chosen.  Not that retransmission and
   MAC-layer headers and control packets may be sent at a lower link
   speed.  The total application-layer throughput (reasonable distance,
   low interference and small number of contention stations) for 802.11g
   is around 20 Mbps.  Consequently, a total of 16 RMCAT flows are
   needed for saturating the wireless interface in this experiment.

4.3.  Multiple RMCAT Flows Sharing the Wireless Uplink

   This test case is different with the previous section with mostly
   downlink transmissions.  When multiple clients attempt to transmit
   video packets uplink over the wireless interface, they introduce more
   frequent contentions and potentially collisions.  As a results, the
   per-client throught is expected to be lower than the downlink-only
   scenario.

         +  Congestion control: Default TCP congestion control.

         +  Traffic timeline:

            -  Start time: 0s.

            -  End time: 99s.

   Expected behavior: All RMCAT flows should get comparable share of the
   network bandwidth with respect to competing TCP flows.  The overall
   bandwidth usage should no less than same case with TCP flows (use TCP
   as performance benchmark).  The delay and loss should be in
   acceptable range for real-time multimedia flow (might need rtp
   circuit breaker to guarantee that?).

5.  Other potential test cases

5.1.  Wi-Fi Roaming

   Wi-Fi roaming need scanning, authentication and re-association which
   will cause packet drops and delay, and interrupt the network
   connection.  RMCAT congestion control algorithms should at least
   recover (if affected by the transition process) after roaming.

5.2.  Wi-Fi/Cellular Switch

   The phone can switch automatically between Wi-Fi and Cellular network
   when the other is not available, and some phones like "Samsung
   Galaxy" have smart network switch to switching to network has better
   connectivity automatically.  Unlike Wi-Fi Roaming, such kind of
   switch might or might not interrupt the network connection, and might
   change the route.  RMCAT congestion control should be able to cope
   with the changes.

5.3.  EDCA/WMM usage

   EDCA/WMM is prioritized QoS with four traffic classes (or Access
   Categories) with differing priorities.  RMCAT flow should have better
   performance (lower delay, less loss) with EDCA/WMM enabled when
   competing against non-interactive background traffic (e.g., file
   transfers).  When most of the traffic over Wi-Fi is dominated by
   media, however, turning on WMM may actually degrade performance.
   This is a topic worthy of further investigation.

5.4.  Legacy 802.11b Effects

   When there is 802.11b devices connected to modern 802.11 network, it
   may affect the performance of the whole network.  Additional test
   cases can be added to evaluate the affects of legancy devices on the
   performance of RMCAT congestion control algorithm.
