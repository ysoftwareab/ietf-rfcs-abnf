Tolerance = 100ppm, the actual bandwidth of the ODUflex is: 

                         2.5Gbps * (1 +/- 100ppm) 

N = Ceiling of 

N1 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.301 683 217Gbps) = 2 

N2 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.249 384 632Gbps) = 3 

    

Type = 1, defined in [RFC5420]) is defined:  

 
 
Value = y1(TBA) MUST be sent back to upstream.
