Abstract

   Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale better
   with the number of multicast sessions than traditional multicast does
   (DCM [BLAZ], SGM [BOIV], Somecast [HELD], MDO6 [IMAI], CLM [OOMS],
   ERM [SHAN], REUNITE [STOI]).  These proposals are also known as
   Explict Multicast (xcast; explicit list of destinations) or Small
   Group Multicast (sgm; the main application being few-to-few
   communication).  To stimulate and streamline the discussion this
   draft is an attempt to make a taxonomy of these mechanisms.

1. Introduction

   Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale better
   with the number of multicast sessions than traditional multicast does
   (DCM [BLAZ], SGM [BOIV], Somecast [HELD], MDO6 [IMAI], CLM [OOMS],
   ERM [SHAN], REUNITE [STOI]).  These proposals are also known as
   Explict Multicast (xcast; explicit list of destinations) or Small

   Group Multicast (sgm; the main application being few-to-few
   communication).  To stimulate and streamline the discussion this
   draft is an attempt to make a taxonomy of these mechanisms.

   In the introduction of [OOMS] it is described how data delivery to
   multiple destinations is a trade-off between bandwidth consumption,
   state&signaling per session and header processing per packet.  This
   draft discusses how the various mechanisms make a specific trade-off
   in the "plane of conservation of misery", and the consequences of
   each approach are investigated.


2. Definitions and Abbreviations

   In this draft we will distinguish following entities in a point-to-
   multipoint delivery tree:

   - sender = source = root

   - receiver = destination = leaf

   - branching router (for a certain stream): router in which a packet
   of the stream is forwarded on more than one interface

   - non-branching router (for a certain stream): router in which a
   packet of the stream is forwarded on one interface

   - hosts = sender + receivers

   - routers = branching routers + non-branching routers

   Throughout the document, the following abbreviations will be used:

   FO = fan-out = number of branches a tree has in a certain router

   I-D = inter-domain

   I-A = inter-area

   MC = multicast (current and new schemes)

   OND = Original Number of Destinations = number of destinations of the
   session

   RND = Remaining Number of Destinations = number of destinations in
   some branch of the tree

   tbl = table

   UC = unicast


3. State&Signaling per session vs Processing per packet

   One of the most important characteristics is the trade-off between
   state&signaling per session and processing per packet.  Table 1 gives
   an overview of the Forwarding State used to deliver a packet to
   multiple destinations for the various methods.  The number between
   brackets indicates the number of look-ups per router.

                 Forwarding State & Number of Look-ups

               Table 1. Taxonomy of terms of State/Look-ups


   The rows in Table 1 can be mapped onto:

   1 = current multicast

   2 = CLM (basic mode), SGM, DCM, Somecast

   3 = REUNITE

   4 = ERM

   5 = MDO6

   6 = CLM (with hierarchical address list encoding = HALE)

   7 = CLM (with use of receiver update notification = RUN)


4. Characteristics

   This section lists a number of characteristics with a short
   description and their possible values.  Section 5 will map the
   possible values to the various xcast/sgm approaches.  The
   characteristics are more or less listed in decreasing importance.

4.1. Non-unicast forwarding state

   State per session in all on-tree routers prevents the current
   multicast model to scale to a huge number of sessions.  Non-unicast
   forwarding state (session specific state) can be kept in:

   a. all on-tree routers

   b. branching routers

   c. distributed over members

   d. sender/packet


4.2 Number of look-ups

   Typically IP header processing (of which table look-ups is one
   component) is a bottleneck in IP networks.  The number of look-ups
   per packet per xcast/sgm router can be:

   a. 1

   b. RND

   c. 1<x<=RND

   d. FO in branching router, 1 in non-branching routers


4.3 Packet overhead

   Compared to a current multicast packet the xcast/sgm packets
   sometimes carry extra information.  This packet overhead results in
   smaller bandwidth savings.  The overhead can be:

Internet Draft      draft-ooms-xcast-taxonomy-00.txt           July 2000


   a. none

   b. list of destinations

   c. tree of branching routers and destinations


4.4. Hop-by-hop protocol required

   Some of the multicast forwarding mechanisms require a companion hop-
   by-hop protocol.  These hop-by-hop protocols create additional
   processing in the routers.  Is a hop-by-hop protocol required?

   a. yes

   b. no

   c. yes, and additional state is kept (on top of unicast forwarding
   state - section 4.1)


4.5. Host control plane requirements

   Host requirements can be split in two seperate requirements: control
   plane requirements (session creation/announcement) and data plane
   requirements (this and next section).  Regarding host control plane
   requirements, the possibilities are:

   a. use current protocol: SDR/IGMP

   b. re-use existing protocol (e.g. SIP)

   c. new protocol


4.6. Host data plane requirements

   a. none

   b. new socket interface or raw socket (possibly only for sender)


4.7. Unicast reroute requires special action

   If the packet delivery relies on more than the unicast routing table
   and the ultimate destination addresses, some special action is
   required to handle unicast reroutes (updating the multicast routing
   table, recalculation tree, ...).  Does a unicast reroute require a

Internet Draft      draft-ooms-xcast-taxonomy-00.txt           July 2000


   special action?

   a. yes

   b. no


4.8. Data always follows optimal (shortest) path

   Does the data always follow the optimal (shortest) path?

   a. no

   b. yes


4.9 Header extensions

   a. none

   b. L3 header option

   c. L3.5 header


4.10. On-route header changes

   Typically header processing (of which header reconstruction is one
   component) is a bottleneck in IP networks.  The degree of header
   changes per packet per xcast/sgm router can be categorized as:

   a. none (besides TTL and DSCP)

   b. bitmap

   c. new header


4.11. On-route IP pseudo header changes

   If the IP pseudo header changes on-route this will have extra
   implications:

   - transport layer (UDP) checksum needs to be recalculated

   - IPsec AH header covers the IP pseudo header, avoiding end-to-end
   authentication (unless an extra encapsulation is used)

Internet Draft      draft-ooms-xcast-taxonomy-00.txt           July 2000


   Does the IP pseudo header change on-route?

   a. no

   b. yes

   c. optional


4.12. Header size

   If the header size does not change on-route this could be beneficial
   for certain router architectures.

   a. fixed

   b. changes on-route

   c. configurable


4.13. Multicast address allocation needed

   a. yes

   b. no


4.14. Traffic converging point

   If traffic has to pass a single router this can be a single point of
   failure or at least a possible bottleneck.

   a. yes

   b. no


4.15. Subset sending

   If a sender can easily address a subset of the original set of
   destinations this will facilitate reliable transport (retransmit to a
   subset) and congestion control (if a subset experiences congestion,
   the sender can send a flow at a lower bitrate).  Can a sender easily
   address a subset?

   a. no

Internet Draft      draft-ooms-xcast-taxonomy-00.txt           July 2000


   b. yes


4.16. Denial of Service (DoS) attack protection

   a. RPF check

   b. upper bound on the number of destinations

   c. other mechanism


4.17. Support for heterogeneous receivers

   Can different DSCPs be specified per destination?

   a. no

   b. yes


4.18. Gradual deployment

   It is important to have a scheme for gradual introduction of a new
   mechanism/protocol.  Some schemes are:

   a. IP tunnels to connect multicast routers

   b. premature cloning if downstream router is not upgraded

   c. multicast packet forwarded in unicast fashion in non-multicast
   routers


5. Taxonomy

   Before classifying the various approaches following remarks have to
   be made:

   1. The taxonomy is based on the current description of the approach
   (current drafts/papers).

   2. A certain approach can be listed with a certain characteristic in
   the table, this does not necessarily mean that this characteristic is
   fundamental to this approach (it only means that the current
   description of the approach has this characteristic).

   3. The characteristics of the current multicast model are determined

   in the assumption that only unicast routing/forwarding exists.

   Table 2 classifies the various methods according to the
   characteristics listed in the previous section.  To facilitate
   comparison, current multicast always has value "a".
