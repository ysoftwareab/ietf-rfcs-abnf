1  Introduction

   The Identifier field in RADIUS Message is only one octet in size. As
   a result, only 256 simultaneous "in flight" packets can be present at
   a time. This problem is also specified in RFC 6613 (RADIUS over TCP)
   Section 2.6.5 and RFC 3539 (Authentication, Authorization and
   Accounting (AAA) Transport Profile) Section 2.4. 

   This problem is significant in embedded systems where RADIUS clients
   most likely re-use the same socket due to the limitation in resources
   such as file descriptors. 

   For Example, consider the deployment of a NAS that handles thousands
   of 802.1x supplicants. There are many scenarios, where thousands of
   supplicants can request for authorization at the same time. Most of
   the 802.1x supplicants may not get authorized due to ID mismatch if
   the RADIUS client re-uses same socket for multiple requests as
   mentioned above.

INTERNET DRAFT    RADIUS Extended Identifier Attribute  November 7, 2015


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-


   Description

      This Attribute has the same purpose as that of Identifier Field in
      Message Header,ie, match a request with its corresponding response
      and aids in detecting duplicate requests if they have the same
      client source IP address and source UDP port and Identifier within
      a short span of time.

   Type

      TBD

   Length

      6 

   Value

      The Value field is four octets


3  Implementation and Usage Guidelines

   The value of the Extended Identifier Attribute should be given more
   precedence than the Identifier field in Message Header. 


3.1  Extended Identifier Attribute Value


   The approach for generating the Extended Identifier Attribute value
   shall be same as followed for generation of Identifier field in

   Message Header. 

   For example, if a Radius client uses the approach of incrementing
   identifier field (can support from 0 to 255) for each request, then
   the same approach shall be used for Extended Identifier Attribute
   too.

   As Extended Identifier attribute length is of 4 bytes, it can support
   from 0 to 4294967295. 


3.2  RADIUS Client

   Radius client should send all the messages (say, Access-Request) with
   both identifier field (as part of message header) and Extended
   Identifier  attribute. 

   Identifier field in the message header can get restarted from 0 after
   it reaches 255. But the Extended Identifier attribute needs to be 
   restarted only after the count of 4294967295(4 bytes) is reached. 


3.3  RADIUS Server 

   If the RADIUS Server supports Extended Identifier Attribute and the
   attribute is present in the message, Radius server must consider only
   the  Extended Radius Identifier attribute value and ignore the
   Identifier field in the message header. In this case, Radius server
   should send the  response (say, Access Challenge, Access Accept or
   Access Reject) to client with the same Extended Identifier Attribute
   and Identifier field in Message Header values. 

   If the server doesn't support Extended Identifier attribute, then
   Identifier field in the message header will be considered and
   Extended Identifier  attribute must be ignored. In this case, this
   attribute shall not be present in the response to the client. 

   For the response message from Radius server, client must consider
   only the value of the Extended Identifier attribute value instead of
   Identifier field in the message header if the attribute exists in the
   message.


4  Backward compatibility

   The proposed usage of both Identifier field and the Extended
   Identifier attribute ensures the backward compatibility with the
   servers that don't have the support for Extended Identifier

   attribute.


5  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security concerns to RADIUS
   or any other specifications referenced in this document.


6  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to allocate the new type code value to
   the proposed Extended Identifier attribute and add it to the list of
   RADIUS Attributes.
