  1.      Introduction 
     This specification defines the naming syntax, object classes, 
     attributes, matching filters, and query processing rules for 
     storing and locating DNS resource records in the FIRS service. 
     Refer to [FIRS-ARCH] for information on the FIRS architecture and 
     [FIRS-CORE] for the schema definitions and rules which govern the 
     FIRS service as a whole. 
      
     Note that these rules and definitions only apply to DNS resource 
     records in FIRS, and do not apply to domainComponent entries or 
     any other domain name elements, unless explicity defined. 
      
     The definitions in this specification are intended to be used with 
     FIRS. Their usage outside of FIRS is not prohibited, but any such 
     usage is beyond this specification's scope of authority. 
      
  2.      Prerequisites and Terminology 
     The complete set of specifications in the FIRS collection 
     cumulative define a structured and distributed information service 
     using LDAPv3 for the data-formatting and transport functions. This 
     specification should be read in the context of the complete set of 
     specifications, which currently include the following:

     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
      
  3.      Naming syntax 
     This specification does not define new syntax rules. DNS resource 
     records are provided as supplemental data to DNS domain name 
     entries. As such, this data relies on pre-existing entries which 
     conform to the naming syntax defined in [FIRS-DNS]. 
      
  4.      Object Classes and Attributes 
     DNS resource record entries in FIRS MUST use the inetDnsRR object 
     class, in addition to the inetDnsDomain object class defined in 
     [FIRS-DNS] and the mandatory object classes defined in 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 3] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-dnsrr-00.txt         May 2003 
   
   
     [FIRS-CORE]. If an entry exists as a referral source, the entry 
     MUST also be defined with the referral object class, in addition 
     to the above requirements. 
      
     The inetDnsRR object class is an auxiliary object class which is 
     subordinate to the inetDnsDomain object class. The inetDnsRR 
     object class has no mandatory attributes, and only has one 
     optional attribute which is inetDnsRRData. The inetDnsRR object 
     class also inherits the attributes defined in the inetDnsDomain 
     and inetResources object classes, including the "cn" naming 
     attribute. 
      
     The schema definition for the inetDnsRR object class is as 
     follows: 
      
          inetDnsRR 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.6.0 NAME 'inetDnsRR' DESC 'DNS record 
            records.' SUP inetDnsDomain AUXILIARY MAY inetDnsRRData ) 
      
     The inetDnsRRData attribute is described as follows: 
      
          inetDnsRRData 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.6.2 NAME 'inetDnsRRData' DESC 'Generic 
            DNS record record data.' EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch SYNTAX 
            inetDnsRRDataSyntax ) 
      
     The inetDnsRRData attribute is a structured (SEQUENCE) attribute, 
     containing multiple subordinate attributes. The layout of the 
     subordinate attributes is identical to the layout of DNS resource 
     records in the domain name system data message. The inetDnsRRData 
     attribute is also multi-valued. This model allows multiple 
     resource records to be associated with each entry, with each 
     resource record having different types, classes, time-to-live 
     values, data values, and so forth. 
      
     The inetDnsRRDataSyntax syntax is defined in ASN.1 as follows: 
      
          inetDnsRRDataSyntax ::= SEQUENCE { 
            RRType        INTEGER (0..65535), 
            RRClass       INTEGER (0..65535), 
            RRTTL         INTEGER (0..4294967295), 
            RRLen         INTEGER (0..65535), 
            RRData        OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..65535)) } 
      
     Note that data which is stored in the RRData element MUST NOT 
     represent compressed domain names.

     An example of the inetDnsRR object class in use is shown in Figure 
     1 below. The example includes attributes from the inetDnsRR, 
     inetDnsDomain, inetResources, and inetAssociatedResources object 
     classes. 
      
          cn=ns1.example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com 
          [top object class] 
          [inetResources object class] 
          [inetDnsDomain object class] 
          [inetDnsRR object class] 
          [inetAssociatedResources object class] 
          | 
          +-attribute: description 
          | value: "The master DNS server for the example.com domain" 
          | 
          +-attribute: inetDnsContacts 
          | value: "hostmaster@example.com" 
          | 
          +-attribute: inetDnsRRData 
          | value: (1, 1, 3600, 4, 0xC0 0x00 0x02 0x0E) 
          | 
          +-attribute: inetAssociatedDnsDomain 
            value: "example.com" 
      
     Figure 1: The entry for the ns1.example.com DNS domain name and 
     its associated resource records. 
      
     In the example shown above, the ns1.example.com domain name has a 
     single inetDnsRRData attribute, which provides a single IPv4 
     address resource record. The subordinate elements of that 
     attribute indicate a RRType value of "1" (IPv4 Address), a RRClass 
     value of "1" (the Internet class), a RRTTL value of 3600 (a TTL of 
     one hour), a RRLen value of 4 (four octets of data), and four 
     single-octet data values which mirror the DNS format of IPv4 
     addresses (in this case, the IPv4 address of "192.0.2.14"). 
      
  5.      Query Processing 
     This specification does not define new query processing rules. DNS 
     resource records are provided as supplemental data to DNS domain 
     name entries. As such, this data relies on the query processing 
     rules defined in [FIRS-DNS]. 
      
     Note that the use of bottom-up processing is more likely to 
     succeed when searching for DNS domain names with resource record

     attributes, since these entries are more likely to exist. However, 
     the default usage of top-down processing is still preferred.

     Security considerations are discussed in [FIRS-ARCH].
