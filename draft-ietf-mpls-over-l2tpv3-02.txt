Abstract

   The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3, (L2TPv3) defines a
   protocol for tunneling a variety of payload types over IP networks.
   This document defines how to carry an MPLS label stack and its
   payload over the L2TPv3 data encapsulation.  This enables an
   application which traditionally requires an MPLS-enabled core network
   to utilize an L2TPv3 encapsulation over an IP network instead.

1. Introduction

   This document defines how to encapsulate an MPLS label stack and its
   payload inside the L2TPv3 tunnel payload.  After defining the MPLS
   over L2TPv3 encapsulation procedure, other MPLS over IP encapsulation
   options including IP, GRE and IPsec are discussed in context with
   MPLS over L2TPv3 in an Applicability section. This document only
   describes encapsulation and does not concern itself with all possible
   MPLS-based applications which may be enabled over L2TPv3.

2. MPLS over L2TPv3 Encoding

   MPLS over L2TPv3 allows tunneling of an MPLS stack [RFC3032] and its
   payload over an IP network utilizing the L2TPv3 encapsulation defined
   in [RFC3931].  The MPLS Label Stack and payload are carried in their
   entirety following IP (either IPv4 or IPv6) and L2TPv3 headers.

              Figure 2.2 MPLS over L2TPv3 encapsulation

   When encapsulating MPLS over L2TPv3, the L2TPv3 L2-Specific Sublayer
   MAY be present.  It is generally not present and hence not included
   in Figure 2.2.  The L2TPv3 Session ID MUST be present. The Cookie MAY
   be present.

   Session ID

      The L2TPv3 Session ID is a 32-bit identifier field locally
      selected as a lookup key for the context of an L2TP Session.  An
      L2TP Session contains necessary context for processing a received
      L2TP packet. At a minimum, such context contains whether the
      Cookie (see description below) is present, the value it was



Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT              MPLS over L2TPv3                October 2006


      assigned, the presence and type of an L2TPv3 L2-Specific Sublayer,
      as well as what type of tunneled encapsulation follows (i.e.,
      Frame Relay, Ethernet, MPLS, etc.)

   Cookie

      The L2TPv3 Cookie field contains a variable length (maximum 64
      bits) randomly assigned value.  It is intended to provide an
      additional level of guarantee that a data packet has been directed
      to the proper L2TP session by the Session ID.  While the Session
      ID may be encoded and assigned any value (perhaps optimizing for
      local lookup capabilities, redirection in a distributed forwarding
      architecture, etc.), the Cookie MUST be selected as a
      cryptographically random value [RFC4086], with the added
      restriction that it not be the same as a recently used value for a
      given Session ID.  A well-chosen Cookie will prevent inadvertent
      misdirection of a stray packet containing a recently reused
      Session ID, a Session ID that is subject to packet corruption, and
      protection against some specific malicious packet insertion
      attacks as described in more detail in Section 4 of this document.

   Label Stack Entry

      An MPLS label stack entry as defined in [RFC3032].

   The optional L2-Specific Sublayer defined in [RFC3931] is generally
   not present for MPLS over L2TPv3.

   Generic IP encapsulation procedures such as fragmentation and MTU
   considerations, handling of TTL, EXP and DSCP bits, etc. are the same
   as the "Common Procedures" for IP encapsulation of MPLS defined in
   Section 5 of [RFC4023] and are not reiterated here.

3. Assigning the L2TPv3 Session ID and Cookie

   Much like an MPLS label, the L2TPv3 Session ID and Cookie must be
   selected and exchanged between participating nodes before L2TPv3 can
   operate. These values may be configured manually, or distributed via
   a signaling protocol. This document concerns itself only with the
   encapsulation of MPLS over L2TPv3, thus the particular method of
   assigning the Session ID and Cookie (if present) is out of scope.

4. Applicability

   The methods defined [RFC4023], [MPLS-IPSEC] and this document all
   describe methods for carrying MPLS over an IP network. Cases where
   MPLS over L2TPv3 is comparable to other alternatives are discussed in
   this section.

INTERNET DRAFT              MPLS over L2TPv3                October 2006


   It is generally simpler to have one's border routers refuse to accept
   an MPLS packet than to configure a router to refuse to accept certain
   MPLS packets carried in IP or GRE to or from certain IP sources or
   destinations. Thus, the use of IP or GRE to carry MPLS packets
   increases the likelihood that an MPLS label spoofing attack will
   succeed.  L2TPv3 provides an additional level of protection against
   packet spoofing before allowing a packet to enter a VPN (much like
   IPsec provides an additional level of protection at a Provider Edge
   (PE) router rather than relying on Access Control List (ACL)
   filters). Checking the value of the L2TPv3 Cookie is similar to any
   sort of ACL which inspects the contents of a packet header, except
   that we give ourselves the luxury of "seeding" the L2TPv3 header with
   a value that is very difficult to spoof.

   MPLS over L2TPv3 may be advantageous compared to [RFC4023], if:

      Two routers are already "adjacent" over an L2TPv3 tunnel
      established for some other reason, and wish to exchange MPLS
      packets over that adjacency.

      Implementation considerations dictate the use of MPLS over L2TPv3.
      For example, a hardware device may be able to take advantage of
      the L2TPv3 encapsulation for faster or distributed processing.

      Packet spoofing and insertion, service integrity and resource
      protection are of concern, especially given the fact that an IP
      tunnel potentially exposes the router to rogue or inappropriate IP
      packets from unknown or untrusted sources.  IP Access Control
      Lists (ACLs) and numbering methods may be used to protect the
      Provider Edge (PE) routers from rogue IP sources, but may be
      subject to error and cumbersome to maintain at all edge points at
      all times.  The L2TPv3 Cookie provides a simple means of
      validating the source of an L2TPv3 packet before allowing
      processing to continue. This validation offers an additional level
      of protection over and above IP ACLs, and a validation that the
      Session ID was not corrupted in transit or suffered an internal
      lookup error upon receipt and processing. If the Cookie value is
      assigned and distributed automatically, it is less subject to
      operator error, and if selected in a cryptographically random
      nature, less subject to blind guesses than source IP addresses (in
      the event that a hacker can insert packets within a VPN core
      network).

   (The first two of the above applicability statements were adopted
   from [RFC4023])

   In summary, L2TPv3 can provide a balance between the limited security
   against IP spoofing attacks offered by [RFC4023] vs. the greater



Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT              MPLS over L2TPv3                October 2006


   security and associated operational and processing overhead offered
   by [MPLS-IPSEC].  Further, MPLS over L2TPv3 may be faster in some
   hardware, particularly if that hardware is already optimized to
   classify incoming L2TPv3 packets carrying IP framed in a variety of
   ways. For example, IP encapsulated by HDLC or Frame Relay over L2TPv3
   may be equivalent in complexity to IP encapsulated by MPLS over
   L2TPv3.

5. Congestion Considerations

   This document specifies an encapsulation method for MPLS inside the
   L2TPv3 tunnel payload. MPLS can carry a number of different protocols
   as payloads. When an MPLS/L2TPv3 flow carries IP-based traffic, the
   aggregate traffic is assumed to be TCP friendly due to the congestion
   control mechanisms used by the payload traffic. Packet loss will
   trigger the necessary reduction in offered load, and no additional
   congestion avoidance action is necessary.

   When an MPLS/L2TPv3 flow carries payload traffic that is not known to
   be TCP friendly and the flow runs across an unprovisioned path, the
   application that uses the encapsulation specified in this document
   MUST employ additional mechanisms to ensure that the offered load is
   reduced appropriately during periods of congestion. The MPLS/L2TPv3
   flow should not exceed the average bandwidth that a TCP flow across
   the same network path and experiencing the same network conditions
   would achieve, measured on a reasonable timescale.

   The comparison to TCP cannot be specified exactly but is intended as
   an "order-of-magnitude" comparison in timescale and throughput. The
   timescale on which TCP throughput is measured is the round-trip time
   of the connection. In essence, this requirement states that it is not
   acceptable to deploy an application using the encapsulation specified
   in this document on the best-effort Internet, which consumes
   bandwidth arbitrarily and does not compete fairly with TCP within an
   order of magnitude. One method of determining an acceptable bandwidth
   is described in [RFC3448]. Other methods exist, but are outside the
   scope of this document.

6. Security Considerations

   There are three main concerns when transporting MPLS labeled traffic
   between PEs using IP tunnels. The first is the possibility that a
   third party may insert packets into a packet stream between two PEs.
   The second is that a third party might view the packet stream between
   two PEs. The third is that a third party may alter packets in a
   stream between two PEs.  The security requirements of the
   applications whose traffic is being sent through the tunnel
   characterizes how significant these issues are.  Operators may use



Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT              MPLS over L2TPv3                October 2006


   multiple methods to mitigate the risk including access lists,
   authentication, encryption, and context validation. Operators should
   consider the cost to mitigate the risk.

   Security is also discussed as part of the applicability discussion in
   section 4 of this document.

6.1 In the Absence of IPsec

   If the tunnels are not secured with IPsec, then some other method
   should be used to ensure that packets are decapsulated and processed
   by the tunnel tail only if those packets were encapsulated by the
   tunnel head.  If the tunnel lies entirely within a single
   administrative domain, address filtering at the boundaries can be
   used to ensure that no packet with the IP source address of a tunnel
   endpoint or with the IP destination address of a tunnel endpoint can
   enter the domain from outside.

   However, when the tunnel head and the tunnel tail are not in the same
   administrative domain, this may become difficult, and filtering based
   on the destination address can even become impossible if the packets
   must traverse the public Internet.

   Sometimes only source address filtering (but not destination address
   filtering) is done at the boundaries of an administrative domain.  If
   this is the case, the filtering does not provide effective protection
   at all unless the decapsulator of MPLS over L2TPv3 validates the IP
   source address of the packet.

   Additionally, the "Data Packet Spoofing" considerations in Section
   8.2. of [RFC3931] and the "Context Validation" considerations in
   Section 5.2 of this document apply. Those two sections highlight the
   benefits of the L2TPv3 Cookie.

6.2 Context Validation

   The L2TPv3 Cookie does not provide protection via encryption.
   However, when used with a sufficiently random 64-bit value which is
   kept secret from an off-path attacker, the L2TPv3 Cookie may be used
   as a simple yet effective packet source authentication check which is
   quite resistant to brute force packet spoofing attacks. It also
   alleviates the need to rely solely on filter lists based on a list of
   valid source IP addresses, and thwarts attacks which could benefit by
   spoofing a permitted source IP address.  The L2TPv3 Cookie provides a
   means of validating the currently assigned Session ID on the packet
   flow, providing context protection, and may be deemed complimentary
   to securing the tunnel utilizing IPsec.  In the absence of
   cryptographic security on the data plane (such as that provided by



Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT              MPLS over L2TPv3                October 2006


   IPsec), the L2TPv3 Cookie provides a simple method of validating the
   Session ID lookup performed on each L2TPv3 packet. If the Cookie is
   sufficiently random and remains unknown to an attacker (that is, the
   attacker has no way to predict Cookie values or monitor traffic
   between PEs) then the Cookie provides an additional measure of
   protection against malicious spoofed packets inserted at the PE over
   and above that of typical IP address and port ACLs.

6.3 Securing the Tunnel with IPsec

   L2TPv3 tunnels may also be secured using IPsec, as specified in
   Section 4.1.3. of [RFC3931].  IPSec may provide authentication,
   privacy protection, integrity checking and replay protection.  These
   functions may be deemed necessary by the operator.  When using IPsec,
   the tunnel head and the tunnel tail should be treated as the
   endpoints of a Security Association.  A single IP address of the
   tunnel head is used as the source IP address, and a single IP address
   of the tunnel tail is used as the destination IP address.  The means
   by which each node knows the proper address of the other is outside
   the scope of this document.  However, if a control protocol is used
   to set up the tunnels, such control protocol MUST have an
   authentication mechanism, and this MUST be used when the tunnel is
   set up.  If the tunnel is set up automatically as the result of, for
   example, information distributed by BGP, then the use of BGP's MD5-
   based authentication mechanism can serve this purpose.

   The MPLS over L2TPv3 encapsulated packets should be considered as
   originating at the tunnel head and as being destined for the tunnel
   tail; IPsec transport mode SHOULD thus be used.

   Note that the tunnel tail and the tunnel head are LSP adjacencies
   (label distribution adjacencies, see [RFC3031]), which means that the
   topmost label of any packet sent through the tunnel must be one that
   was distributed by the tunnel tail to the tunnel head.  The tunnel
   tail MUST know precisely which labels it has distributed to the
   tunnel heads of IPsec-secured tunnels.  Labels in this set MUST NOT
   be distributed by the tunnel tail to any LSP adjacencies other than
   those that are tunnel heads of IPsec-secured tunnels.  If an MPLS
   packet is received without an IPsec encapsulation, and if its topmost
   label is in this set, then the packet MUST be discarded.

   Securing L2TPv3 using IPsec MUST provide authentication and
   integrity.  (Note that the authentication and integrity provided will
   apply to the entire MPLS packet, including the MPLS label stack.)
   Consequently, the implementation MUST support ESP with null
   encryption.  ESP with encryption MAY be supported if a source
   requires confidentiality.  If ESP is used, the tunnel tail MUST check
   that the source IP address of any packet received on a given SA is

   the one expected.

   Key distribution may be done either manually or automatically by
   means of IKE [RFC2409] or IKEv2 [RFC4306].  Manual keying MUST be
   supported.  If automatic keying is implemented, IKE in main mode with
   preshared keys MUST be supported.  A particular application may
   escalate this requirement and request implementation of automatic
   keying.  Manual key distribution is much simpler, but also less
   scalable, than automatic key distribution. If replay protection is
   regarded as necessary for a particular tunnel, automatic key
   distribution should be configured.
