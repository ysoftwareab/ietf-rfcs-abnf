Abstract

   According to RFC 3046, there is only one DHCP Option 82 allowed in a
   certain DHCP message.  This document describes several cases that
   need more than one Relay Agent to add link information.  Proposed
   method is to have different Relay Agents add multiple DHCP Option 82.

Internet-Draft             Option 82 stacking               October 2009


1.  Introduction

   In a typical DSL access network, DHCP Relay Agent Option is used to
   carry the access loop identification, which identifies the access
   loop of the user and is useful for troubleshooting and policy
   management functions.  In FTTC/FTTB scenarios of PON system, there
   are multiple subscribers behind an ONU and both OLT and ONU's slot/
   port information are needed to identify a use accurately.  However, a
   DHCP Relay Agent does NOT add a "second" relay agent option, when it
   receives a DHCP packet with a Relay Agent Information option already
   present from a trusted circuit, according to chapter 2.1 of
   [RFC3046].

   As described in[draft-huang-dhc-relay-ps-00], when a layer 3 switch
   is installed for a 20 floor building and a layer 2 switch is
   installed at each floor inside this building, there is a policy
   delivery problem if only one relay agent inserts access loop
   identification.

   If we define a new sub-option, DHCP Relay Agents appending access
   loop identification to existing DHCP Option 82 will have to identify
   the information inserted by other Relay Agents previously, which is
   complicated.  Another reason not to do so, is that some options can't
   be changed because of the signature.  Define a new option x is also a
   bad choice because of incompatibility with legacy device.

   What is proposed is to insert multiple DHCP Option 82 to a DHCP
   packet.  Stacking DHCP Option 82 is much simpler and is able to void
   the problems mentioned above.


2.  Multi-level Access Loop Identification Scenarios

   There are at least two cases where multi-level access loop
   identification is needed to be carried in DHCP packets.

   A typical PON FTTB/FTTC network includes OLT, ONU and ODN, as
   depicted in figure 1.  ONU can be Multi-Dwelling Unit (MDU) or Multi-
   Tenant Unit (MTU).  In this case, ONU provides network access for
   multiple residential users or multiple business users via DSL or
   Ethernet typically.  In order to locate a user precisely from a DHCP
   message via Option 82, ONU need add a user's access loop
   identification on which port the user is attached, while OLT need add
   PON port where the ONU is attached.  Therefore, two DHCP Relay Agents
   reside in ONU and OLT respectively.

   Another case is cascaded LAN system, which port information of multi-
   level LAN switches is needed to locate a user.  There is more
   information of this case in[draft-huang-dhc-relay-ps-00].  Figure 2
   depicts an example of this case.  Both curb switch and floor switch
   need add access loop identifier to DHCP Option 82.  That means there
   are two levels of DHCP Relay Agents.

3.  Stacking DHCP Option 82 Syntax

   There is no change to the syntax specified in [RFC3046](DHCP Relay
   Agent Information Option) in a Type-Length-Value format.


4.  Agent Operation

   A trusted circuit of a DHCP Relay Agent is attached by a trusted

   downstream (closer to client) network element, which is between the
   current DHCP Relay Agent and the client.  The current DHCP Relay
   Agent MAY add a DHCP relay agent option but not set the giaddr field.
   In the case of multi-level DHCP Relay Agent, the current DHCP Relay
   Agent can add a "second" relay agent option to a DHCP packet that has
   a DHCP relay agent option which was added by a trusted DHCP Relay
   Agent attached to the trusted circuit.  The DHCP packet will further
   be forwarded per normal DHCP relay agent operations, setting the
   giaddr field as it deems appropriate.

   A DHCP relay agent adding a Relay Agent Information field SHALL
   always add it as the last option (but before 'End Option' 255, if
   present) in the DHCP options field of any recognized BOOTP or DHCP
   packet.  When there are multiple DHCP Option 82 in a packet, the
   options should be arranged in the order of time sequence.

   The Relay Agent Information option echoed by a server MUST be removed
   by either the relay agent or the trusted downstream network element
   which added it when forwarding a server-to-client response back to
   the client.  If there are multiple DHCP Option 82 in a DHCP packet,
   Option 82 added previously will become the last option (but before
   'End Option' 255, if present) in the DHCP options field after last
   option82 is striped.


5.  Applicability

   Option 82 stacking is practicable in the scenario of multiple Relay
   Agents between DHCP client and DHCP server.  Multiple Relay Agents
   are especially common in FTTB/FTTC with PON or multi-level switches
   based access network.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security effect on current mechanism in
   addressing security attacks.


7.  IANA Consideration

   No requests to IANA.
