1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis] describes in details about a new BGP NLRI
   to distribute a flow specification, which is an n-tuple comprising a
   sequence of matching criteria that can be applied to IP traffic.
   [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6] extends [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis] to make
   it also usable and applicable to IPv6 data packets.
   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn] extends the flow-spec rules for layer 2
   Ethernet packets.

   Segment Routing (SR) for unicast traffic has been proposed to cope
   with the usecases in traffic engineering, fast re-reroute, service
   chain, etc.  SR architecture can be implemented over an IPv6 data
   plane using a new type of Segment Routing Header (SRH)
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].  SRv6 Network Programming
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming] defines the SRv6
   network programming concept and its most basic functions.  SRv6 SID
   may have the form of LOC:FUNCT:ARGS::.

Internet-Draft       BGP Flow Specification for SRv6           June 2020


   LOC: Each operator is free to use the locator length it chooses.
   Most often the LOC part of the SID is routable and leads to the node
   which instantiates that SID.

   FUNCT: The FUNCT part of the SID is an opaque identification of a
   local function bound to the SID. (e.g.  End: Endpoint, End.X, End.T,
   End.DX2 etc.).

   ARGS: A function may require additional arguments that would be
   placed immediately after the FUNCT.

   This document specifies two new BGP Flow Specification (FS) component
   types to support Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane (SRv6)
   filtering.  The match field is destination address of IPv6 header,
   but it's a SID copy from SRH rather than a traditional IPv6 address
   (refer to Figure 1).

   o  SRv6: IPv6 Segment Routing, SRv6 is a method of forwarding IPv6
      packets on the network based on the concept of source routing.

   o  SID: Segment Identifier

   o  BSID: Binding SID

3.  The Flow Specification Encoding for SRv6

   The Flow Specification NLRI-type consists of several optional
   components, each of which begins with a type field (1 octet) followed
   by a variable length parameter. 13 component types are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis] and [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6] for IPv4
   and IPv6.  This document defines two new component types for SRv6.

3.1.  Type TBD1 - Whole SID

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Contains a list of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match the
   SID/binding SID or a range of whole SID.

   The operator byte is encoded as:

                          0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                        | e | a | 0 | 0 | 0 |lt |gt |eq |
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

   e - end-of-list bit.  Set in the last {op, value} pair in the
   sequence.

   a - AND bit.  If unset, the previous term is logically ORed with the
   current one.  If set, the operation is a logical AND.  It should be
   unset in the first operator byte of a sequence.  The AND operator has
   higher priority than OR for the purposes of evaluating logical
   expressions.

   0 - SHOULD be set to 0 on NLRI encoding, and MUST be ignored during
   decoding.

   lt - less than comparison between data and value.

   gt - greater than comparison between data and value.

   eq - equality between data and value.

Internet-Draft       BGP Flow Specification for SRv6           June 2020


   The bits lt, gt, and eq can be combined to match the SID or a range
   of SID (e.g. less than SID1 and greater than SID2).

   The value field is encoded as:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   ~                         SID(128bits)                          ~
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   The format of SID is described in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] and
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming]

3.2.  Type TBD2 - Some bits of SID

   For some scenarios route policy with the whole 128 bits SID matching
   is too long and not necessary.
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming] defines the format of
   SID is LOC:FUNCT:ARGS::. In some scenarios, traffic packets can just
   match Locator, Function ID, Argument or some combinations of these
   different fields rather than whole 128 bits SID.  The new component
   type TBD2 defined below is for matching some bits of SID.

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Contains a list of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match
   some bits of SID.

   The operator byte is encoded as:

                           0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                        | e | a |   type    |lt |gt |eq |
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

   e, a, lt, gt and eq: as defined in Section "Type TBD1 - Whole SID".

   type:

   000 : SID's LOC bits

   001 : SID's FUNCT bits

   010 : SID's LOC:FUNCT bits

   011 : SID's FUNCT:ARGS bits

   The value field is encoded below as the lengths in bits of LOC, FUNCT
   and ARGS followed by the SID rounding up to bytes:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  LOC Length   | FUNCT Length  | ARGS Length |    SID          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   ~                        SID(continue)                          ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

   LOC Length : 1-octet field indicating the length in bits of LOC in
   SID.

   FUNCT Length : 1-octet field indicating the length in bits of FUNCT
   in SID.

   ARGS Length : 1-octet field indicating the length in bits of ARGS in
   SID.

   SID : the SID containing LOC, FUNCT and ARGS, and rounding up to
   bytes.

4.  Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification over the security considerations in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis] and [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section complies with [RFC7153].

   Under "Flow Spec IPv6 Component Types" registry, IANA is requested to
   assign the following values:

      +-----------+-------------------+----------------+
      | Value     | Name              | Reference      |
      +-----------+-------------------+----------------+
      | TBD1 (15) | Whole SID         | This Document  |
