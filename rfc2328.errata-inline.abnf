                    Next RT3's router-LSA for the backbone is shown.  It
                    indicates that RT3 has a single attachment to the
                    backbone.  This attachment is via an unnumbered
                    point-to-point link to Router RT6.  RT3 has again
                    indicated that it is an area border router.
