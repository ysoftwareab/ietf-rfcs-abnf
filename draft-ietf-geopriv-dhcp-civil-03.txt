2.  Introduction

   Many end system services can benefit by knowing the approximate
   location of the end device. In particular, IP telephony devices need
   to know their location to contact the appropriate emergency response
   agency and to be found by emergency responders.

   There are two common ways to identify the location of an object,
   either through geospatial coordinates or by so-called civic address.
   Geospatial coordinates indicate longitude, latitude and altitude,
   while civic addresses indicate a street address.

   A related draft [13] describes a DHCPv4 [2] option for conveying
   geospatial information to a device.  This draft describes how DHCPv4
   and DHCPv6 [5] can be used to convey the civic location to devices.
   Both can be used simultaneously, increasing the chance to deliver
   accurate and timely location information to emergency responders.

   End systems that obtain location information via the mechanism
   described here then use other protocol mechanisms to communicate this
   information to the emergency call center or to convey it as part of
   presence information.

   Civic information is useful since it often provides additional,
   human-usable information particularly within buildings.  Also,
   compared to geospatial information, it is readily obtained for most
   occupied structures and can often be interpreted even if incomplete.
   For example, for many large university or corporate campuses,
   geocoding information to building and room granularity may not be
   readily available.

   Unlike geospatial information, the format for civic information
   differs from country to country.  Thus, this draft establishes an
   IANA registry for civic location data fields.  The initial set of
   data fields is derived from standards published by the United States
   National Emergency Number Association (NENA) [16].  It is anticipated
   that other countries can reuse many of the data elements.

   The same civic address information can often be rendered in multiple
   languages and scripts.  For example, Korean addresses are often shown
   in Hangul, Latin and Kanji, while some older cities have multiple
   language variants (Munich, Muenchen and Monaco, for example).  Since
   DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 do not currently support a mechanism to query for a
   specific script or language, the DHCP server SHOULD provide all
   common renderings to the client and MUST provide at least the
   rendering in the language and script appropriate to the location
   indicated.  For example, for use in presence information, the target
   may be visiting from a foreign country and want to convey the

   information in a format suitable for watchers in its home country.
   For emergency services, the rendering in the local language is likely
   to be most appropriate.  To provide multiple renderings, the client
   repeats sequences of address elements, prefixing each with 'language'
   and/or 'script' element (see Section 3.3).  The language and script
   remain in effect for subsequent elements until overridden by another
   language or script element.

   The DHCP server MAY provide location information for multiple
   locations related to the target, for example, both the network
   element and the network jack itself. This is likely to help in
   debugging network problems, for example.

   As discussed in Security Considerations (Section 5), the GeoConf_Civi
   option SHOULD be returned by DHCP servers only when the DHCP client
   has included this option in its 'parameter request list' (Section 3.5
   [2]).

   The DHCP long-options mechanism described in RFC 3396 [8] MUST be
   used if the civic address option exceeds the maximum DHCP option size
   of 255 octets.

3.  Format of the DHCP Civic Location Option

3.1  Overall Format for DHCPv4

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    What       |        civic address elements                ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code GEOCONF_CIVIC: The code for this DHCP option is TBD by IANA.
   N: The length of this option is variable.
   Countrycode: The two-letter ISO 3166 country code in capital ASCII
      letters, e.g., DE or US.
   What: The 'what' element describes which location the DHCP refers to.
      Currently, three options are defined:  the location of the DHCP
      server (a value of 0), the location of the network element
      believed to be closest to the client (1) or the location of the
      client (2).  Option (2) SHOULD be used, but may not be known.
      Options (1) and (2) SHOULD NOT be used unless it is known that the
      DHCP client is in close physical proximity to the server or
      network element.

   Civic address element: Zero or more elements comprising the civic
      address, with the format described below (Section 3.3).

3.2  Overall Format for DHCPv6

   The DHCPv6 [5] civic address option refers generally to the client as
   a whole.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   option-code: OPTION_CIVIC_ADDRESS (TBD)
   option-len: Length of the Countrycode, 'what' and civic address
      elements.

   Countrycode: See above (Section 3.1).
   What: See above (Section 3.1).
   Civic address element: See above (Section 3.1).

3.3  Element Format

   For both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, each civic address element has the
   following format:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   CAtype      |   CAlength    |      CAvalue                 ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   CAtype: A one-octet descriptor of the data civic address value.
   CAlength: The length, in octets, of the CAvalue, not including the
      CAlength field itself.  Data SHOULD be encoded in mixed case,
      following the customary spelling.
   CAvalue: The civic address value, encoded as UTF-8 [6], and written
      in uppercase letters where applicable. The script indication is
      written in mixed-case, with the first letter a capital letter.

   Elements SHOULD be included in numeric order from lowest to highest
   of their CAtype if the server only provides one language and script
   rendition.  In general, an element is labeled in its language and
   script by the most recent 'language tag' (CAtype = 0) element
   preceding it. Since not all elements depend on the script and
   language, a client accumulates the elements by CAtype and then
   selects the most desirable language and script rendition if there are
   multiple elements for the same CAtype.

3.4  Civic Address Components

   Since each country has different administrative hierarchies, with
   often the same (English) names, this specification adopts a simple
   hierarchical notation that is then instantiated for each country.  We
   assume that five levels are sufficient for sub-national divisions
   above the street level.

   All elements are OPTIONAL and can appear in any order.  Abbreviations
   do not need a trailing period.

   The CA types labeled in the second column correspond to items from
   the NENA "Recommended Formats & Protocols For ALI Data Exchange, ALI
   Response & GIS Mapping" [16], but are applicable to most countries.
   The "NENA" column refers to the data dictionary name in Exhibit 18 of
   [16].

   The column labeled PIDF indicates the element name from [14].

   The "language" item (CAtype 0) optionally identifies the language
   used for presenting the address information, drawing from the tags
   for identifying languages in [7].  If omitted, the default value for
   this tag is "i-default" [3].

   The "script" item (CAtype 128) optionally identifies the script used
   for presenting the address information, drawing from the tags for
   identifying scripts in ISO 15924 [11].  If omitted, the default value
   for this tag is "Latn".

   The NAM object is used to aid user location ("Joe Miller" "Alice's
   Dry Cleaning").  It does not identify the person using a
   communications device, but rather the person or organization
   associated with the address.

   While a landmark (LMK) can indicate a complex of buildings,
   'building' (CAtype 25) conveys the name of a single building.

   The 'unit' object (CAtype 26) contains the name or number of a part
   of an address where there are separate administrative units, such as
   separate companies or families who occupy that structure.  Common
   examples include suite or apartment designations.

   For POD and PRD, in English-speaking countries, the abbreviations N,
   E, S, W, and NE, NW, SE, SW should be used.

   STS designates a street suffix.  In the United States (US), the
   abbreviations recommended by the United States Postal Service
   Publication 28 [15], Appendix C, SHOULD be used.

   The "type of place" item (CAtype 25) describes the type of place
   described by the civic coordinates.  For example, it describes
   whether it is a home, office, street or other public space.  The
   values are drawn from the items in the rich presence [17] document.
   This information makes it easy, for example, for the DHCP client to
   then populate the presence information.  Since this is an
   IANA-registered token, the language and script designations do not
   apply for this element.

4.  Example

   Rather than showing the precise byte layout of a DHCP option, we show
   a symbolic example below, representing the civic address of the
   Munich city hall in Bavaria, Germany.  The city and state name are
   also conveyed in English and Italian in addition to German; the other
   items are assumed to be common across all languages.  All languages
   use the latin script.

5.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this
   GeoConf_Civic option, DHCP authentication in RFC3118 [4] SHOULD be
   used to protect the integrity of the DHCP options.

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and
   requesting client can discover the information contained in this
   option.

   To minimize the unintended exposure of location information, the
   GeoConf_Civic option SHOULD be returned by DHCP servers only when the
   DHCP client has included this option in its 'parameter request list'
   (Section 3.5 [2]).

   When implementing a DHCP server that will serve clients across an
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security
   risks.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA register a new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
   option code for the Civic Address (GEOCONF_CIVIC).

   This document establishes a new IANA registry for CAtypes designating
   civic address components.  According to RFC 2434 [12], this registry
   operates under the "Specification Required" rules.  The IANA
   registration needs to include the following information:

   CAType: Numeric identifier, assigned by IANA.
   Brief description: Short description identifying the meaning of the
      element.
   Reference to published specification: A stable reference to an RFC or
      other permanent and readily available reference, in sufficient
      detail so that interoperability between independent
      implementations is possible.
   Country-specific considerations: If applicable, notes whether the
      element is only applicable or defined for certain countries.
