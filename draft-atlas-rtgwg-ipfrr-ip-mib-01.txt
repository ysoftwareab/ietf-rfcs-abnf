1.  Introduction

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it defines the managed objects used for IP
   routes and interfaces in relation to IP Fast-Reroute.  This document
   uses terminology from [FRAMEWORK], [IPFRR] and [IPFRR-UTURN].

   Current work is underway to define mechanisms for determining
   alternate paths for traffic to use when the original path becomes
   unavailable due to a local failure.  The alternate next-hops can be
   computed in the context of any IGP.

   There are certain configuration attributes for IP Fast-Reroute that
   should be configured to enable IP Fast Reroute in the context of the
   IGP.  These configuration attributes of IP Fast-Reroute are not
   covered by this MIB module.  Examples include whether IP Fast-Reroute
   is enabled on a network region (i.e.  an OSPF area or IS-IS level)
   and the desired local hold-down timer[IPFRR], whose proper value is
   dependent upon the size of the network region.

   It is possible for traffic other than IP to depend upon and use the
   alternate next-hops computed by IP Fast-Reroute.  An example would be
   MPLS traffic whose path is configured via LDP[RFC3036].  The
   additional details (for example, outgoing MPLS label) pertaining to
   alternate next-hops that are required by such traffic are not covered
   by this MIB module.

   An IP route may be reachable via multiple primary next-hops which
   provide equal-cost paths.  Where IP Fast-Reroute is enabled, each
   primary next-hop will be protected by one or more alternate
   next-hops.  Such an alternate next-hop may itself be a primary
   next-hop.

1.1  The SNMP Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   This MIB module consists of five global objects, organized into the
   ipFrrProtectStats group, and two tables.

2.1  ipFrrProtectStats Group

   The global objects in this group provide summary information related
   to protection for all IP routes.  The information available includes
   counts of all routes, of all protected routes, of all unprotected
   routes, of all routes which are protected against a link failure, and
   of all routes which are protected against a node failure.

2.2  ipFrrAltTable

   The ipFrrAltTable extends the inetCidrRouteTable[RFC2096-update] to
   provide information about each alternate next-hop associated with a
   primary next-hop used by a route.  Statically configured alternate
   next-hops associated with primary next-hops can be created.

2.3  ipFrrNoAltTable

   The ipFrrNoAltTable extends the inetCidrRouteTable[RFC2096-update] to
   provide information about the routes which do not have an alternate
   next-hop associated with any of the route's primary next-hop.  The
   entry provides an explanation for the lack of protection.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  The ipFrrAltTable contains routing and
   forwarding information that is critical to the operation of the
   network in the event of a local failure.  Allowing unauthenticated
   write access to this table can compromise the validity of the
   alternate forwarding information.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e.  objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
   the values of these objects when sending them over the network via
   SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET them.
