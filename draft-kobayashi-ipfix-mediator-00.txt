Abstract

   This document describes several solution scenarios that use IPFIX
   Mediators and defines a reference internal process model.  An IPFIX
   Mediator is an intermediate node between IPFIX Devices and traffic
   Collectors.  This node acts as a IPFIX proxy or IPFIX concentrator.
   IPFIX Mediator has several capabilities such as storage function of
   original Flow Records, flexible aggregation function, and proper
   distribution function for collector or analyzer.  The combination of
   these capabilities can solve several problems related to traffic
   monitoring.

1.  Introduction

   Several problems regarding traffic monitoring have occurred in each
   network domain.  As the sizes of networks become larger, the number
   of Flow Records becomes greater.  Large numbers of Flow Records have
   been burdening management networks, and the Collecting Process.
   Maintaining scalability is difficult as a given network grows.  On
   the other hand, networks such as IPv4, IPv6, and VPN on MPLS have
   recently become more multifaceted.  These sorts of Flow Records need
   to be analyzed separately from a different perspective.  However,
   handling them separately without improving the capability of
   Collector is difficult.

   First, IPFIX protocol has an extensive Template format and flexible
   functions.  By defining IPFIX Mediators, we can increasingly take
   advantage of an extensive Template format, and handle Flow Records in
   accordance with our preference.  This document describes some
   solutions using IPFIX Mediator that solve the above problem and
   components that are needed in the internal function process.

   An IPFIX Mediator is located between one or more Exporting Processes
   and one or more Collecting Processes.  IPFIX Mediator has a main
   function such as storing original Flow Records, aggregating them
   flexibly just like IPFIX concentrator, and distributing them to an
   appropriate Collector or traffic analyzer in accordance with flow
   contents.

   The internal model of a Mediator is composed of Collecting Processes,
   Metering Processes, and Exporting Processes.  IPFIX Mediator acts as
   a Collector by receiving Flow Records, and it acts as an Exporter by
   sending Flow Records.  This dual-role architecture enables cascading
   Mediators and buiilding a combination of several solutions.

   This document proposes a solution by using IPFIX Mediator and a
   reference model for IPFIX Mediators and describes the key component
   of this architecture.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The definitions of basic IPFIX and PSAMP terms are identical with
   those in the [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework] and [RFC3917].  Other than
   the above terminology, the following terminology is used in this
   document.

   IPFIX Mediator:
      An IPFIX Mediator hosts at least one chain of Exporting Process,
      Metering Process, and Collecting Process.  It may host multiple
      combinations of each process.

   Selection Process:
      An IPFIX Mediator's Selection Process is similar to that of PSAMP
      Devices, which is described in [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework].
      However, its Selection Process differs from the following
      functions.  This process in PSAMP Devices has two types of
      selection functions: Filtering and Sampling.  In addition, the
      filtering function has two types of filtering methods: field-match
      filtering and hash-based selection.  This process in IPFIX
      Mediator has only the field-match filtering function.  This filter
      selects Flow Records based on Flow Record content.

   Aggregation Process:
      This process creates aggregated Flow Records, in accordance with
      aggregation rules that are described in
      [I-D.dressler-ipfix-aggregation], from Flow Records that are the
      output of the selection process.

   Storing Process:
      This process selects specified Information Elements by the storing
      rules from the output of Collecting Process and stores these Flow
      Records in a storage system such as a database or flat-file
      system.  Information Elements that are described in
      [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] are specified in storing rules.  In
      addition, the Observation Domain ID and Export Time in the header
      of IPFIX messages are specified in the storing rules.

3.  Solution Scenarios with IPFIX Mediators

3.1.  Flexible Aggregation

   An IPFIX Mediator can aggregate Flow Records as IPFIX concentrator
   and reduce the number of Flow Records received by a traffic
   collector.

   The following figure indicates a cascade connection of IPFIX
   Mediators.  If a Collector measures a traffic matrix to obtain
   traffic demand, it needs Flow Records of the whole network domain,
   but does not need detailed Flow Records.  In the first step, a
   Mediator receives Flow Records from IPFIX Devices and then creates
   aggregated low-level Flow Records.  For example, this step is prefix
   mask aggregation.  Next, the Mediator receives aggregated Flow
   Records and aggregates them further.  For example, the second step is
   the aggregation of the BGP next-hop address and exporter address.
   After this, the collector receives high-level aggregated Flow Records
   and then stores them.  This method enables step-by-step aggregation
   of Flow Records without overloading a single node.

   Figure A: Flexible Aggregation with cascading IPFIX Mediators.

3.2.  Distributed Aggregation

   As the network becomes widely global, the distances between PoPs
   become longer, and the maintenance of a dedicated management network
   is very expensive.  Therefore, the huge number of Flow Records has
   been burdening the management networks of global ISPs.  If we place
   Mediators at each PoP, the number of Flow Records exported from each
   PoP can be reduced.  Mediators can minimize the number of Flow
   Records exported to the Collector.  If the Collector needs detailed
   information, it can retrieve Flow Records from Mediators that store
   original Flow Records.

   A management networks of a global ISP is shown in the following
   figure.  The Mediators are located at each PoP of the network, and
   they collect Flow Records from routers in each PoP domain.  The
   Mediator can reduces the number of Flow Records by aggregating or
   filtering, so this system can reduces load of a management network.

3.3.  Duplication of Flow Records

   An IPFIX Mediator can duplicates Flow Records to achieve redundant
   storage or utilizes them for several purposes.  The pair of
   Collecting Process and Metering Processes is similar to the pair of
   the Observation Point and Metering Process.  The Collecting process
   duplicates Flow records by forwarding them to the multi-Metering
   Process.

   Several departments in an ISP want to use the same traffic
   information for each intended purpose.  For example, the network
   design department measures the traffic matrix as traffic demand, and
   the customer service division uses traffic information for the
   accounting information of each customer while the network operation
   center uses traffic information for trouble shooting analysis.  That
   case is shown in the following figure.  A Mediator can distribute
   Flow Records to several Collectors that have appropriate aggregated
   granularity.  In addition, when NOC conducts trouble shooting, they
   can retrieve past Flow Records from Mediators.

   Figure C: Duplication of Flow Records for several purposes.

3.4.  Distribution of Flow Records

   An IPFIX Mediator can distribute Flow Records based on flow content.
   This function enables load-balancing of Collector and sorting out
   Flow Records without extra Collector functions.  If the Flow Records
   are used as accounting information, this solution is useful.

   When we disclose traffic information to each customer, security or
   privacy policy should be considered.  In that case, Mediator can hide
   private information about each customer.  For example, Mediator can
   distribute them based on RD(Route Distinguisher), egress IF, Peering
   AS number, or BGP next-hop which identifies the customer.  In the
   following figure, the Mediator distributes based on RD.  It securely
   allows for each customer to access only their own records.

3.5.  Adding Information Elements

   An IPFIX Mediator can add the following kinds of Information
   Elements.

   Complementing lost information by aggregation:
      A Mediator can add complementary information to replace lost
      information by aggregation.  A main problem of aggregation is the
      loss of some Information Elements.  This problem could be
      alleviated by adding complementary Information Elements.  They are
      added by the aggregation process and they help traffic collector
      to analyze aggregated flow.

      *  averageActiveTime:
         This Information Element indicates average time in milliseconds
         of difference between flow start time and end time of each flow
         included in the aggregated flow.  It is created from flow time
         stamp Information Elements.  There are "flowStartSeconds",



Kobayashi, et al.        Expires April 19, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               IPFIX Mediators                October 2006


         "flowEndSeconds", "flowStartMilliSeconds",
         "flowEndMilliSeconds", "flowStartSysUpTime", and
         "flowEndSysUpTime".  In addition, "minimumActiveTime" and
         "maxmumActiveTime" might be considered as well as this element.

      *  synCount:
         It is the total number of Flow Records that has
         "tcpControlBits" which SYN bit set to 1 in aggregated flow.  By
         this elements, we can grasp the number of SYN packets in whole
         network.  And also, "ackCount", "finCount", "pshCount",
         "urgCount" and "rstCount" might be considered as well as this
         element.

      *  flowCount:
         It is the number of Flow Records that is included in the
         aggregated flow.

   Adding information instead of router:
      The Information Elements that ca not be put in a original Flow
      Record by a router are added to Flow Records by Mediator.  For
      example, those information elements are BGP next-hop, and RD.  A
      Mediator can add these elements by referring to BGP route
      information and SNMP MIB.  Hereby, traffic collectors do not need
      to recognize the difference between implementations of routers
      from several vendors.

   Adding information that becomes easy to analyze:
      These Information Elements enable nodes in the next stage to
      become easy to analyze.  For example, "Biflow ID" could be quoted.
      "Biflow" is defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-biflow].  This indicates a
      common ID that each UniFlow Record has in both directions.  These
      4-tuple elements that are in "Directional Key Field", have this
      value as follows.  There is a case by case consideration of which
      fields will be included in the Hash function.

      Biflow ID= Hash[src.IP+Dst.IP+Src.Port+Dst.Port]

      Hereby, the next stage node can easily be used to gather UniFlow
      Records.  In an asymmetric routing condition, it is useful for the
      accounting or analysis of anomalies in a session.

3.6.  Extraction of Suspicious Flow

   An IPFIX Mediator filters based on flow content.  If filter
   conditions are set depending on the suspicious flow as follows, the
   next Collector receives the specified suspicious flow and detects an
   anomalous flow by simply monitoring the traffic volume of each
   suspicious flow.

4.  Internal components Model

   The following figure indicates five components (Collecting,
   Selection, Aggregation, Exporting, and Storing) within the IPFIX
   Mediator.  These components are mapped to three processes as the
   IPFIX architecture in the [RFC3917].  The Collecting Process matches
   the IPFIX Collecting Process and the chain of Selection Process; the
   Aggregation Process matches the IPFIX Metering Process.  The
   Exporting Process matches the IPFIX Exporting Process.

   Figure E: Key components within IPFIX Mediator.

   Each process is associated with a common identifier in the IPFIX
   Mediator.  This method is similar to PSAMP associations in
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech].

4.1.  Collecting Process

   This process receives Flow Records from IPFIX devices or a previous
   IPFIX Mediator.  The instance of this process is created according to
   the IPFIX session.  This process has functions that are described in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  The Collecting Process also forwards
   received Flow Records with IPFIX header information to multiple
   Selection Processes or Storing Processes.  In other words, Flow
   Records can be duplicated by forwarding several Selecting Process.

4.2.  Selection Process

   The Selection Process receives Flow Records from Collecting
   Processes.  This process has a filtering function and selects Flow
   Records that are matched under given conditions.  Prior to receiving
   Flow Records, this process has instruction pattern data that is

Internet-Draft               IPFIX Mediators                October 2006


   defined by the user, which specifies how the Flow Records are treated
   by this process.  If some fields in the Flow Record match the
   instruction pattern, this process selects Flow Records that have all
   fields and forwards these to the Aggregation Process.  For example,
   this process selects Flow Records to prevent the next stage node from
   being counted twice within the same flow.

4.3.  Aggregation Process

   This process gathers Flow Records within a given time interval and
   then distinguishes Flow Records that have common properties.  If
   values of a given key field are the same, that means these Flow
   Records have common properties.  This process merges Flow Records
   that have a common property and creates an aggregated Flow Record.
   Therefore, for example, aggregated Flow Records have an aggregated
   counter that indicates the number of packets.  These functions are
   defined in accordance with the IPFIX aggregation rule in
   [I-D.dressler-ipfix-aggregation].  This process has instructions that
   are user defined prior to receiving Flow Records.  The process
   indicates fields that should become aggregated flow keys and other
   fields that should be kept or discarded.  In addition, these
   instruction rules include Information Elements that should be added
   to aggregated Flow Records.  The aggregated flow MAY need to
   complement information that is discarded during the aggregation
   process.  For example, the aggregated flow has "averageActiveTime" or
   "flowCount" elements.

4.4.  Exporting Process

   This process forwards Flow Records to the next IPFIX Mediator or
   Collector.  These processes manage the reporting template and make an
   IPFIX datagram.  The "Export time" and "Observation Domain Id" of
   IPFIX header information can be either of the following methods.  The
   time of "Export time" field depends on whether the IPFIX Mediator is
   a proxy or not.  From the point of view of a Collector, if this IPFIX
   Mediator is a proxy, it becomes the most recent time of the
   originally received data.  If it is not a proxy, "Export time"
   becomes the export time of the Mediator.  In the first case, this
   process needs to obtain the originally received data from the
   Aggregating Process.  If IPFIX Mediator is not a proxy, its
   "Observation domain ID" should be zero.  These IPFIX Header
   information values are forwarded from the Aggregation Process.

   In addition, this process distributed Flow Records based on Flow
   content, and then it exports each classified Flow Records to each
   Collector.

   The Exporting Process classifies Flow Records based on Peering AS, as
   shown in the following figure.  Each classified Flow Record is
   exported to a dedicated Collector per Peering AS.

4.5.  Storing Process

   The storing process selects specified Information Elements by the
   storing instruction from the input Flow Records.  Prior to receiving
   Flow Records, this process has instructions that are configured by
   the user, which indicate whether each field should be stored or
   discarded.  The field modifier indicates "keep" or "discard", which
   is similar to the instruction of the aggregation process.  The field
   modifier specifies how these Information Elements are treated by the
   process.  This field modifier is applied to Information Elements
   within Flow Record and header information of IPFIX messages.  The
   header information of IPFIX messages are "Observation Domain ID" and
   "Export time".  This header information MAY be used when IPFIX
   datagrams are made of past Flow Records.

   When another node retrieves past Flow Records, we can consider
   several specifications.  One solution is that another node gets a
   specified flat-file from a Mediator, and decodes that flat-file by
   itself.  Other solutions are that another node sends out the query
   command to the Mediator through the XML-RPC, SNMP, or NETCONF, and
   then the Mediator exports the specified past Flow Records.  This
   function is out of the scope of this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   The IPFIX concentrator uses the IPFIX protocol.  Security
   considerations about flow information are described in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].
