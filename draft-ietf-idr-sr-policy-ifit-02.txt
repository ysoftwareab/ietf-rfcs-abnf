                BGP SR Policy Extensions to Enable IFIT
                    draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-ifit-02

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting
   of one or more segment lists and necessary path attributes.  It
   enables instantiation of an ordered list of segments with a specific
   intent for traffic steering.  In-situ Flow Information Telemetry
   (IFIT) refers to network OAM data plane on-path telemetry techniques,
   in particular the most popular are In-situ OAM (IOAM) and Alternate
   Marking.  This document defines extensions to BGP to distribute SR
   policies carrying IFIT information.  So that IFIT methods can be
   enabled automatically when the SR policy is applied.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]
   is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more segment
   lists and necessary path attributes.  It enables instantiation of an
   ordered list of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering.

   In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT) denotes a family of flow-
   oriented on-path telemetry techniques (e.g.  IOAM, Alternate

   Marking), which can provide high-precision flow insight and real-time
   network issue notification (e.g., jitter, latency, packet loss).In
   particular, IFIT refers to network OAM (Operations, Administration,
   and Maintenance) data plane on-path telemetry techniques, including
   In-situ OAM (IOAM) [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] and Alternate Marking
   [RFC8321].  It can provide flow information on the entire forwarding
   path on a per-packet basis in real time.

   An automatic network requires the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
   monitoring on the deployed service.  So that the system can quickly
   detect the SLA violation or the performance degradation, hence to
   change the service deployment.  For this reason, the SR policy native
   IFIT can facilitate the closed loop control and enable the automation
   of SR service.

   This document defines extensions to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to
   distribute SR policies carrying IFIT information.  So that IFIT
   behavior can be enabled automatically when the SR policy is applied.

   This BGP extension allows to signal the IFIT capabilities together
   with the SR-policy.  In this way IFIT methods are automatically
   activated and running.  The flexibility and dynamicity of the IFIT
   applications are given by the use of additional functions on the
   controller and on the network nodes, but this is out of scope here.

   IFIT is a solution focusing on network domains according to [RFC8799]
   that introduces the concept of specific domain solutions.  A network
   domain consists of a set of network devices or entities within a
   single administration.  As mentioned in [RFC8799], for a number of
   reasons, such as policies, options supported, style of network
   management and security requirements, it is suggested to limit
   applications including the emerging IFIT techniques to a controlled
   domain.  Hence, the IFIT methods MUST be typically deployed in such
   controlled domains.

2.  Motivation

   IFIT Methods are being introduced in multiple protocols and below is
   a proper picture of the relevant documents for Segment Routing.
   Indeed the IFIT methods are becoming mature for Segment Routing over
   the MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing over IPv6 data
   plane (SRv6), that is the main focus of this draft:

      IOAM: the reference documents for the data plane are
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] for SRv6 and
      [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr] for SR-MPLS.

Internet-Draft             bgp-sr-policy-ifit                  July 2021


      Alternate Marking: the reference documents for the data plane are
      [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark] for SRv6 and
      [I-D.ietf-mpls-rfc6374-sfl], [I-D.gandhi-mpls-rfc6374-sr] for SR-
      MPLS.

   The definition of these data plane IFIT methods for SR-MPLS and SRv6
   imply requirements for various routing protocols, such as BGP, and
   this document aims to define BGP extensions to distribute SR policies
   carrying IFIT information.  This allows to signal the IFIT
   capabilities so IFIT methods are automatically configured and ready
   to run when the SR Policy candidate paths are distributed through
   BGP.

   It is to be noted that, for PCEP (Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol), [I-D.chen-pce-pcep-ifit] proposes the
   extensions to PCEP to distribute paths carrying IFIT information and
   therefore to enable IFIT methods for SR policy too.

3.  IFIT methods for SR Policy

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] records operational and telemetry
   information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between
   two points in the network.  In terms of the classification given in
   RFC 7799 [RFC7799] IOAM could be categorized as Hybrid Type 1.  IOAM
   mechanisms can be leveraged where active OAM do not apply or do not
   offer the desired results.  When SR policy enables the IOAM, the IOAM
   header will be inserted into every packet of the traffic that is
   steered into the SR paths.

   The Alternate Marking [RFC8321]technique is an hybrid performance
   measurement method, per RFC 7799 [RFC7799] classification of
   measurement methods.  Because this method is based on marking
   consecutive batches of packets.  It can be used to measure packet
   loss, latency, and jitter on live traffic.

   This document aims to define the control plane.  While the relevant
   documents for the data plane application of IOAM and Alternate
   Marking are respectively [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark] for Segment Routing over IPv6 data
   plane (SRv6), [I-D.ietf-mpls-rfc6374-sfl],
   [I-D.gandhi-mpls-rfc6374-sr] and [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr] for
   Segment Routing over the MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS).

4.  IFIT Attributes in SR Policy

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy], a new SAFI is
   defined (the SR Policy SAFI with codepoint 73) as well as a new NLRI.
   The NLRI contains the SR Policy candidate path and, according to
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy], the content of the SR
   Policy Candidate Path is encoded in the Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] using a new Tunnel-
   Type called SR Policy Type with codepoint 15.  The SR Policy encoding
   structure is as follows:

      SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
      Attributes:
         Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
            Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                Binding SID
                SRv6 Binding SID
                Preference
                Priority
                Policy Name
                Policy Candidate Path Name
                Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                Segment List
                    Weight
                    Segment
                    Segment
                    ...
                ...

   A candidate path includes multiple SR paths, each of which is
   specified by a segment list.  IFIT can be applied to the candidate
   path, so that all the SR paths can be monitored in the same way.  The
   new SR Policy encoding structure is expressed as below:

      SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
      Attributes:
         Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
            Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                Binding SID
                SRv6 Binding SID
                Preference
                Priority
                Policy Name
                Policy Candidate Path Name
                Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                IFIT Attributes
                Segment List
                    Weight
                    Segment
                    Segment
                    ...
                ...

   IFIT attributes can be attached at the candidate path level as sub-
   TLVs.  There may be different IFIT tools.  The following sections
   will describe the requirement and usage of different IFIT tools, and
   define the corresponding sub-TLV encoding in BGP.

   Once the IFIT attributes are signalled, if a packet arrives at the
   headend and, based on the types of steering described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], it may get steered into an
   SR Policy where IFIT methods are applied.  Therefore it will be
   managed consequently with the corresponding IOAM or Alternate Marking
   information according to the enabled IFIT methods.

   Note that the IFIT attributes here described can also be generalized
   and included as sub-TLVs for other SAFIs and NLRIs.

5.  IFIT Attributes Sub-TLV

   The format of the IFIT Attributes Sub-TLV is defined as follows:

   Where:

   Type: to be assigned by IANA.

   Length: the total length of the value field not including Type and
   Length fields.

   sub-TLVs currently defined:

      * IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Sub-TLV,

      * IOAM Incremental Trace Option Sub-TLV,

      * IOAM Directly Export Option Sub-TLV,

      * IOAM Edge-to-Edge Option Sub-TLV,

      * Enhanced Alternate Marking (EAM) sub-TLV.

   The presence of the IFIT Attributes Sub-TLV implies support of IFIT
   methods (IOAM and/or Alternate Marking).  It is worth mentioning that
   IOAM and Alternate Marking can be activated one at a time or can
   coexist; so it is possible to have only IOAM or only Alternate
   Marking enabled as Sub-TLVs.  The sub-TLVs currently defined for IOAM
   and Alternate Marking are detailed in the next sections.

   In case of empty IFIT Attributes Sub-TLV, i.e. no further IFIT sub-
   TLV and Length=0, IFIT methods will not be activated.  If two
   conflicting IOAM sub-TLVs are present (e.g.  Pre-allocated Trace
   Option and Incremental Trace Option) it means that they are not
   usable and none of the two methods will be activated.  The same
   applies if there is more than one instance of the sub-TLV of the same
   type.  Anyway the validation of the individual fields of the IFIT
   Attributes sub-TLVs are handled by the SRPM (SR Policy Module).

   The process of stopping IFIT methods can be done by setting empty
   IFIT Attributes Sub-TLV, while, for modifying IFIT methods
   parameters, the IFIT Attributes Sub-TLVs can be updated accordingly.
   Additionally the backward compatibility is guaranteed, since an
   implementation that does not understand IFIT Attributes Sub-TLV can
   simply ignore it.

5.1.  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Sub-TLV

   The IOAM tracing data is expected to be collected at every node that
   a packet traverses to ensure visibility into the entire path a packet
   takes within an IOAM domain.  The preallocated tracing option will
   create pre-allocated space for each node to populate its information.

   The format of IOAM pre-allocated trace option sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

              Fig. 2 IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Sub-TLV

   Where:

   Type: 1 (to be assigned by IANA).

   Length: 6, it is the total length of the value field (not including
   Type and Length fields).

   Namespace ID: A 16-bit identifier of an IOAM-Namespace.  The
   definition is the same as described in section 4.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM Trace Type: A 24-bit identifier which specifies which data types
   are used in the node data list.  The definition is the same as
   described in section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Flags: A 4-bit field.  The definition is the same as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-flags] and section 4.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Rsvd: A 4-bit field reserved for further usage.  It MUST be zero and
   ignored on receipt.

5.2.  IOAM Incremental Trace Option Sub-TLV

   The incremental tracing option contains a variable node data fields
   where each node allocates and pushes its node data immediately
   following the option header.

   The format of IOAM incremental trace option sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

               Fig. 3 IOAM Incremental Trace Option Sub-TLV

   Where:

   Type: 2 (to be assigned by IANA).

   Length: 6, it is the total length of the value field (not including
   Type and Length fields).

   All the other fields definition is the same as the pre-allocated
   trace option sub-TLV in section 4.1.

5.3.  IOAM Directly Export Option Sub-TLV

   IOAM directly export option is used as a trigger for IOAM data to be
   directly exported to a collector without being pushed into in-flight
   data packets.

   The format of IOAM directly export option sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

6.  SR Policy Operations with IFIT Attributes

   The details of SR Policy installation and use are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  This document complements
   SR Policy Operations described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] by adding the IFIT
   Attributes.

   The operations described in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy]
   are always valid.  The only difference is the addition of IFIT
   Attributes Sub-TLVs for the SR Policy NLRI, that can affect its
   acceptance by a BGP speaker, but the implementation MAY provide an
   option for ignoring the unrecognized or unsupported IFIT sub-TLVs.
   SR Policy NLRIs that have been determined acceptable, usable and
   valid can be evaluated for propagation, including the IFIT
   information.

   The error handling actions are also described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy],indeed A BGP Speaker MUST
   perform the syntactic validation of the SR Policy NLRI to determine
   if it is malformed, including the TLVs/sub-TLVs.  In case of any
   error detected, either at the attribute or its TLV/sub-TLV level, the
   "treat-as-withdraw" strategy MUST be applied.

   The validation of the IFIT Attributes sub-TLVs introduced in this
   document MUST be performed to determine if they are malformed or
   invalid.  The validation of the individual fields of the IFIT
   Attributes sub-TLVs are handled by the SRPM (SR Policy Module).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new sub-TLV in the registry "BGP Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute sub-TLVs" to be assigned by IANA:

   This document requests creation of a new registry called "IFIT
   Attributes Sub-TLVs".  The allocation policy of this registry is
   "Specification Required" according to RFC 8126 [RFC8126].

   The following initial Sub-TLV codepoints are assigned by this
   document:

8.  Security Considerations

   The security mechanisms of the base BGP security model apply to the
   extensions described in this document as well.  See the Security
   Considerations section of [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

   SR operates within a trusted SR domain RFC 8402 [RFC8402] and its
   security considerations also apply to BGP sessions when carrying SR
   Policy information.  The isolation of BGP SR Policy SAFI peering
   sessions may be used to ensure that the SR Policy information is not
   advertised outside the SR domain.  Additionally, only trusted nodes
   (that include both routers and controller applications) within the SR
   domain must be configured to receive such information.

   Implementation of IFIT methods (IOAM and Alternate Marking) are
   mindful of security and privacy concerns, as explained in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] and RFC 8321 [RFC8321].  Anyway incorrect
   IFIT parameters in the BGP extension SHOULD NOT have an adverse
   effect on the SR Policy as well as on the network, since it affects
   only the operation of the telemetry methodology.

   IFIT data MUST be propagated in a limited domain in order to avoid
   malicious attacks and solutions to ensure this requirement are

   respectively discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].

   IFIT methods (IOAM and Alternate Marking) are applied within a
   controlled domain where the network nodes are locally administered.
   A limited administrative domain provides the network administrator
   with the means to select, monitor and control the access to the
   network, making it a trusted domain also for the BGP extensions
   defined in this document.
