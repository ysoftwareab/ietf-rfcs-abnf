Internet-Draft       Clearance Sponsor Attribute             March 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document defines the clearance sponsor attribute.  This 
   attribute may be carried in a public key certificate in the Subject 
   Directory Attributes extension, in an attribute certificate in the 
   attribute field, in a directory as an attribute, or in protocols that 
   support attributes. 

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the clearance sponsor attribute.  This 
   attribute may be included in public key certificates [RFC5280], 
   attribute certificates [RFC3281bis], directories [X.500]/[RFC4512], 
   or locations that support attributes.  These attributes may be used 
   in authorization decisions. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The attributes are defined using ASN.1 [X.680]. 

2. Clearance Sponsor 

   The clearance sponsor attribute indicates the sponsor of the 
   clearance of the object with which this attribute is associated.  
   This attribute is only meaningful if the clearance attribute 
   [RFC3281bis] is also present.  The clearance sponsor attribute is a 
   DirectoryString [RFC5280], which MUST use the UTF8String CHOICE, 
   string with a minimum size of 1 characters and a maximum of 32 
   characters. 

   The following object identifier identifies the sponsor attribute: 

     id-aa-KP-clearanceSponsor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {   
       joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 68 
     }

Internet-Draft       Clearance Sponsor Attribute             March 2009 
    

   The ASN.1 syntax for the clearance sponsor attribute is as follows: 

     clearanceSponsor ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
       WITH SYNTAX            DirectoryString { ub-clearance-sponsor } 
       EQUALITY-MATCHING RULE caseIgnoreMatch 
       SINGLE VALUE           TRUE 
       IDENTIFIED BY          id-clearanceSponsor 
     } 

     ub-clearance-sponsor INTEGER ::= 32 

   There must only be one value of clearanceSponsor associated with a 
   particular object. 

3. Security Considerations 

   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization process, the 
   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each value must ensure 
   that the correct value is applied.  Further, once applied to the 
   object it must be bound to the object; this binding is normally 
   performed by digitally signing over the object and the attribute to 
   ensure data integrity. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
