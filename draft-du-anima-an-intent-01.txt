1.  Introduction

   This document describes the concept and consideration of the
   Autonomic Network Intent, which is used to operate the Autonomic
   Nodes within Autonomic Networks.  The background to Autonomic Network
   (AN) is described in [RFC7575] and [RFC7576].  A generic discovery
   and negotiation protocol (GDNP) is proposed by
   [I-D.carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol], which would be used in the
   propagation of the Autonomic Network Intent.

   The Autonomic Network Intent should be able to be unscrambled by all
   Autonomic Nodes, although certain parts of contents may not be
   relevant to a specific Autonomic Node.  The Autonomic Network Intent
   gives operational guidance for every Autonomic Node.

   This document also proposes a generic format for Autonomic Network
   Intent.

   The interface to receive or configure the Autonomic Network Intent is
   out of scope.  The distribution mechanism of the Autonomic Network
   Intent is introduced in [I-D.liu-anima-intent-distribution].

   Note in draft: This version is preliminary.  In particular, many
   design details may be subject to change until the anima
   specifications become agreed.

2.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

   Autonomic Function:  A feature or function which requires no
      configuration, and can derive all required information either
      through self-knowledge, discovery or through Intent.

   Autonomic Node:  A node which employs exclusively Autonomic
      Functions.

   Legacy Node:  A non-autonomic node, i.e., a node which employs some
      non-autonomic functions.

   Autonomic Network:  A network containing exclusively Autonomic Nodes.
      It may contain one or several Autonomic Domains.

   Autonomic Service Agent:  An agent implemented on an Autonomic Node
      which implements an Autonomic Function.

   Intent:  An abstract, high level policy used to operate the network,
      quoted from [RFC7575].

   Autonomic Network Intent:  Intent that is used to intervene the
      running status of the Autonomic Network.

   Administrative Intent:  Intent that is used to manage the network
      infrastructure.

   Service Intent:  Intent that is used to intervene the network
      services running over the network infrastructure.

3.  Intervention of the Network Running by Autonomic Network Intent

   The Autonomic Network is supposed to work with minimum intervention
   from human operators.  However, it is still needed to receive some
   form of guidance/information/orders in order to meet specific
   requirements.

   Upon receiving the Autonomic Network Intent, the Autonomic Node
   should be able to unscramble the meaning of the intent with no
   ambiguity, and act accordingly.

Internet-Draft          Autonomic Network Intent               July 2015


   Using this intent approach, the operator can manage the network as a
   whole, and does not need to configure specific node(s) in the network
   like what happens in the traditional NMS system.  In other words, the
   operator communicates with the Autonomic Network using an abstract or
   high lever intent, and the configurations of the nodes take place
   automatically.  By replacing most of the NMS jobs, intent-based
   management makes the network management work much easier than before.

   On the other sides, the intent-based and NMS-based management may co-
   exist for a long time, because autonomic behavior will be defined
   function by function.  Similarly, at the beginning of defining the
   Autonomic Network Intents, the intent-based method cannot be assumed
   to cover every aspect of network management.

3.1.  Use Cases for Autonomic Network Intent

   An example of the intent can be found in
   [I-D.jiang-anima-prefix-management].  Other examples include what
   kind of IGP (such as OSPF) or what kind of transport layer technology
   (such as MPLS) should be used for the autonomic domain.

   After these configurations in the network level, detailed
   configurations in every node are not needed; whereas, policy-based
   method will need detailed configurations for every specific node.

   An Intent should contains some common information that are needed by
   every intent and some specific information that influence the
   configuration of the nodes, and the detailed content and format of
   the specific part should be defined under its specific application
   environment by other documents, such as the prefix management intent
   defined in [I-D.jiang-anima-prefix-management].

   {Editor Notes: as autonomic functions are defined one by one, the
   intent should be developed at a per need basis.}

   {Editor Notes: the intents introduced here look like not that
   abstract, however, it does help to make the network more autonomic,
   and reduce the configuration jobs.  Maybe in future, when the
   autonomic node becomes more intelligent, some of the intents defined
   will disappear or be replaced.}

3.2.  Administrative Intent and Service Intent

   The Autonomic Networks are supposed to be self-managed.  It includes
   managing the network infrastructure, and also the network services
   that are running over the network infrastructure.  However, the
   network services have different features against network

   administration, as listed below.  Hence, it may be better to organize
   them into separated Administrative Intent and Service Intent.

   o  A Service Intent may have a smaller scope than the Administrative
      Intent because only the nodes related to the service need to know
      this intent.  Although it may only affect a few nodes, the Service
      Intent may also be propagated domain wide.

   o  A Service Intent may have a limited lifetime, while the
      Administrative Intents are normally permanent although the content
      of the Administrative Intent may be updated from time to time.

   o  There maybe are many Service Intents in the autonomic domain,
      while only one Administrative Intent for a giving Autonomic
      Service Agent.

   {Editor notes: one possibility is to treat the Service Intent as a
   normal Intent for a certain Autonomic Service Agent, such as a
   Autonomic Service Provision Agent.}

4.  Uniform Format of the Autonomic Network Intent

   {Editor Notes: It is still remaining an open issue for the way that
   intent may be organized.  Should the intent be a single one in a
   given AN domain with a hierarchical version, or multiple intents,
   each of which targets different Autonomic Service Agent?  For now,
   the below text takes the later approach.}

   This section proposes a uniform intent format.  It uses the tag-based
   format.

   Autonomic intent:  The root tag for the Autonomic Network Intent.

   Intent type:  It indicates the intent type, which is associated with
      a specific Autonomic Service Agent.

   Autonomic domain:  It indicates the domain of the Autonomic Network.
      It is also the scope of the Autonomic Network Intent.

   Intent version:  It indicates the version of the Autonomic Network
      Intent.  This is an important feature for synchronization.

   Model version:  The version of the model used to define the intent.

   Name:  The name of the intent which describes the intent for human
      operators.

   Signature:  The signature is used as a security mechanism to provide
      authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.

   Timestamp:  The timestamp of the creation of the intent using the
      format supported by the IETF [TBC].

   Lifetime:  The lifetime in which the intent may be observed.  A
      special case of the lifetime is the definition of permanent
      intents.

   Content:  It contains the main information of the intent.  It may
      include objects, policies, goals and configuration data.  The
      detailed contents and formats should be defined under their
      specific situations by documents that specifies the Autonomic
      Service Agent.  Within the content, there may be sub_intents.

   {Editor Notes: JSON is one of the term candidates for the Autonomic
   Network Intent format.}

5.  Security Considerations

   Relevant security issues are discussed in
   [I-D.carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol].  The Autonomic Network Intent
   requires strong security environment from the start, because it would
   be great risk if the Autonomic Network Intent had been maliciously
   tampered.  The Autonomic Intent should employ a signature scheme to
   provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one new format.  The IANA is requested to
   establish a new assigned list for it.
