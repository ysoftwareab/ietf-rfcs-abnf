                  draft-hallambaker-mesh-reference-01

Abstract

   The Mathematical Mesh ?The Mesh? is an end-to-end secure
   infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and
   credential data between multiple user devices.  The core protocols of
   the Mesh are described with examples of common use cases and
   reference data.

1.  Introduction

   NB: The reference material in this document is generated from the
   schema used to derive the source code.  The tool used to create this
   material has not been optimized to produce output for the IETF
   documentation format at this time.  Consequently the formatting is
   currently sub-optimal.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Architecture

4.1.  Data Model

4.1.1.  First Class Object

4.1.2.  Profile

   A profile is a first class object.  It has a globally unique
   identifier that provides an unambiguous reference to the profile in
   any situation.

4.1.3.  Record

   A record describes the state of an object at the completion of a
   specific Transaction.

4.1.4.  Transaction

   A transaction is an event in which the state of an object changes.
   Every transaction has a globally unique transaction identifier.
   Transaction identifiers are issued in a monotonic sequence such that
   a transaction that completes at time t1 will always have a lower
   transaction identifier than one that begins at time t2 where t2 > t1.

6.1.  MeshProtocol Transactions

6.1.1.  Transaction: Hello

   o

      *  Request: HelloRequest

      *  Response: HelloResponse

   Report service and version information.

   The Hello transaction provides a means of determining which protocol
   versions, message encodings and transport protocols are supported by
   the service.

6.1.2.  Transaction: ValidateAccount

   o

      *  Request: ValidateRequest

      *  Response: ValidateResponse

   Request validation of a proposed name for a new account.

   For validation of a user's account name during profile creation.

6.1.3.  Transaction: CreateAccount

   o

      *  Request: CreateRequest

      *  Response: CreateResponse

   Request creation of a new mesh account.

   Unlike a profile, a mesh account is specific to a particular Mesh
   portal.  A mesh account must be created and accepted before a profile
   can be published.
