Internet-Draft  General Location Transformation Protocol   February 2011


1.  Introduction

   All location-based services rely on location information in one form
   or another.  In the case where location information is available, but
   is not in a readily usable form, it must be transformed.  Location
   transformation is more complicated than straightforward unit
   conversion, since location can be represented according to many
   different frames of reference.

   This document introduces a general method, or protocol, which can be
   implemented by client and server applications to transform location
   information between a variety of location forms and formats.  It is
   conceivable that many kinds of applications could benefit from this
   mechanism, but are likely to be too numerous to describe here, and
   therefore, except for example purposes, are beyond the scope of this
   document.

   A section that provides a mechanism for the discovery of
   transformation services using the LoST protocol [RFC5222] is
   included.

   The structure of this document includes terminology, Section 2,
   followed by a discussion of the basic elements involved in location
   transformation.  These elements, or actors, are discussed in an
   overview section, Section 3, accompanied by a graph, associated
   processing steps, and a brief discussion around the use, options, and
   message examples for a location transformation protocol.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119],
   with the important qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these
   terms apply to the design of the Location Configuration Protocol and
   the Location Dereferencing Protocol, not its implementation or
   application.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Transformation:  Rendering one form of location information into
      another form.

   Location:  Refering to Location information that is useful in the
      context of location-based applications.

   Geocoding:  A process of transforming a civic style location into a
      geographic style of location.

   Reverse Geocoding:  A process of transforming a geographic style of
      location into a civic style of location.

   Geographic location:  A format of location information that is
      represented by geographic coordinates within a geographic
      coordinate system.

   Geodetic location:  A replacement term for geographic location.

   Datum:  A defined system of reference associated with the associated
      set of geographic location information.

3.  Overview of Location Transformation

   For location information to be usable, it must be represented in a
   form that makes sense to the person or application that receives it.
   In most cases, location information is in one of two common forms,
   civic location, and geographic, or "geodetic" location.

   Civic location, which has a datum that varies by country, or region,
   is most often thought of as a "street address".  A civic location is
   often represented as the common address at which a person lives or
   works, or even just visits.  An example of this might be the
   (example) address of "316 Hightower Street, Independence, Missouri,
   USA", which represents a house, apartment, or building number, along
   some named street or thoroughfare, within some village, town, or
   city, and belonging to particular state, province, and country.  The
   notion of having a standard set of civic address elements may exist
   among some jurisdictions on Earth, though is not universally the
   case.

   Geodetic location, (in this document, we equate the term geodetic
   location with geographic location), represents a specific place on
   some kind of grid.  As an example, one commonly used reference system
   standard, or "datum", is referred to as WGS84, and defines a global
   grid that can be used to locate a position anywhere on earth using a
   set of geodetic coordinates for latitude, longitude, and (optionally)
   altitude.

   Whereas most geodetic datums are more broadly defined to be a
   continental or globally applicable coordinate reference system, civic
   locations are defined locally, based on a specific preference,
   dictated by a municipality, region, county, state, or country.

   The transformation mechanism described here is not only for use in
   transforming location information from civic-to-geodetic, or
   geodetic-to-civic, but also between various civic, geo, and other
   representations.

4.  Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

   Geographic Information System (GIS) is software that is designed to
   enable applications that rely on location.  GIS applications provide
   a mechanism to store, compare, manipulate, and report geographic
   information, incorporating many types of geodetic and civic location
   features and elements.  GIS systems, once they are provisioned with
   location data, are useful in associating geodetic data with civic
   data.  For example, given a lat/lon, a GIS application can be used to
   display the coordinate position on a geographic map display, and can
   be used to associate other geographic features, including a civic
   location in close proximity to the input set of coordinates.

5.  Location Transformation Services

   Location transformation services are intentioned to be able to
   support public, private, or commercial needs, and are envisioned to
   be made available via the Internet or through commercial network
   interconnections.

7.  Discovering the Location Transformation Service

   In order to process a location transformation, there must be a
   mechanism to discover such a service.  The LoST [RFC5222] protocol
   does service discovery by using already supplied location, as well as
   Service URN that is specific to the service being requested.

   For this purpose, a new service URN, urn:service:transform is
   introduced.  Since a LoST server is expected to contain both geodetic
   and civic data layer information, either form is supported in the
   input, along with the specific service urn.

   If the LoST server cannot successfully perform this transformation
   because the input location is outside it's internal data footprint,
   it is expected that a URI would be returned that would point the LoST
   client to a more location appropriate LoST server.

8.  Applications in Location Transformation

8.1.  Civic-to-Geodetic Location Transforms

   Description

      Geocoding is the transformation of a civic address into a set of
      geodetic coordinates.  Since the specific technique of conversion
      to these geodetic coordinates is implementation specific, this
      document only describes the interface over which a request/
      response for a civic address is sought.  Many forms of a civic
      address can be used as input, and the response can be provided
      according to a specified datum, or may be in accordance with a
      default datum if no input datum is requested, or the requested
      datum is unavailable.  The common case for geocoding is to provide
      a civic street address and get back a lat/lon (2D example).  This
      interface supports the return of polygon data sets as well as
      individual coordinates.  It also supports specific shape types as
      well as point data.

   Examples



      USPS-Civic-to-Geo-Point  USPS Street Address to WGS84 geographic
         coordinate pair

      MSAG-Civic-to-Geo-Polygon  MSAG Street Address to Parcel polygon
         (multi-coordinate set)

8.2.  Geodetic-to-Civic Location Transforms

   Description

      Reverse geocoding is the transformation from a set of geodetic
      coordinates to a representative civic location.  Every commercial
      GIS software has its own unique algorithm that it uses to make
      this conversion.  Because of this, it may be that no two
      vendors'geocoding operations result in the same output.  The type
      of data used within the GIS also has an important impact on the
      expected results.  Finite polygon data, for example, (often
      referred to as parcel polygons), that is loaded into a GIS will
      provide a much more sensible rendering of a civic address than
      would be produced by the datasets containing only point data
      (e.g., site structure) or street centerline data.  As with
      geocoding, because this operation is implementation specific, this
      document only describes the interface protocol over which a
      request/response for a civic location is asked for.  Since civic

Internet-Draft  General Location Transformation Protocol   February 2011


      location can be represented in Various formats, both the request
      and response message sets will contain profile identifiers that
      describe which form of civic location was sought, as well as which
      type was returned (in case the requested type was unavailable).

   A Couple of Use Case Examples



      2D-Geo-to-Postal  Two dimensional geographic coordinates to USPS
         Street Address

         A transformation from a two-dimensional geodetic coordinate set
         to a USPS styled civic location in a form consistent with USPS
         Publication 28 guidlines.  This case is when a lat/lon target
         destination is supplied by, lets say a personal navigation
         device, but no corresponding civic location is provided.

      3D-Geo-to-Postal  Three dimensional geographic coordinates to USPS
         Street Address

         This transformation is a variation of the above case, but bring
         in the ability to do transformations where elevation or
         altitude differentiates one civic location from another (e.g.,
         hi-rise appartment building).

8.3.  Sample Coordinate Reference System Transformations

   Potential Applications of Transformed Location

      Of the many Coordinate Reference Systems and published addressing
      standards currently in use, some of the more popular CRS' used in
      commercial and public safety contexts are as follows.



      NAD83-to-WGS84  NAD83 (North American Datum 1983) to WGS84 (World
         Geodetic Standard 1984) Geodetic transforms

      WGS84-to-NAD83  WGS84 to NAD83 Geodetic transforms

      MSAG-to-USPS  MSAG to USPS Civic transforms

10.  Output Resolution

   Along with the actual location information, additional qualifying
   information is also necessary, depending on the type of location used

10.1.  Geocoding Resolution

10.1.1.  Uncertainty and Confidence

   For any geodetic point shape that is measured directly, or in this
   case, derived as a result of a transformation operation, there must
   be included with the result, additional qualifying information, such
   as the point's resolution, essentially a tolerance, or the amount of
   probable error, and the estimated probability of that resolution/
   error.

10.2.  Reverse Geocoding Resolution

   For any civic address that is returned from a reverse geocoding
   operation, it may be advantageous to know which elements of the civic
   location that was returned were found in the GIS data layer.  Some of
   these data may be matched in the internal data structure
