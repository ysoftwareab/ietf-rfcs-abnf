1.  Introduction

1.1.  Objective

   Nowdays network infrastructure devices such as switches, routers, and
   firewalls are always under the attack of the well-known network
   security threats which are sammrized in [I-D.ietf-xia-sacm-dp-
   security-profile].  Hence it is significant to ensure that the
   devices in a specific network meet the minimal security requirements
   according to their intended functions.  In this case, the concept of
   security baseline for the network infrastructure device has been
   proposed in the above mentioned draft [I-D.ietf-xia-sacm-dp-security-
   profile] as well.  The security baseline refers to the basic and
   compulsory capabilities of identifying the possible threats and
   vulnerabilities in the device itself, and enfocing the security
   hardening measurement.  And it could be set to benchmark the security
   posture of an individual network device.

   Basically, the overall security baseline of a particular network
   infrastructure device can be designed and deployed into three
   different layers, namely the application layer, the network layer,
   and the infrastructure layer.  Moreover, the network layer security
   baseline is further classified into data plane, control plane, and
   management plane.  In this document, we focus on the designation of
   data model for control plane security baseline while the security
   baseline of other layers and planes are proposed in the companion
   documents.

   The control plane security basedline focus on the control signaling
   security of the network infrastructure device.  The aim is to protect
   the normal information exchange between devices against various
   attcks (i.e. eavesdropping, tampering, spoofing and flooding attack)
   and restrict the malicious control signaling, for ensuring the
   correct network topology and forwading behavior.

1.2.  Security Baseline Data Model Design

   The security baseline of a certain device is dependent on many
   factors including but not limited to the different device types
   (i.e., router, switch, firewall) and their corresponding security
   features supported, and the specific security requirements of network
   operators.  Owning to such a number of variations, it is impossible
   to design a comprehensive set of baseline for all devices.  This
   document and the companion ones are going to propose the most
   important and universal points of them.  More points can be added in
   future following the data model scheme specified in this document.

   [I-D.ietf-birkholz-sacm-yang-content] defines a method of
   constructing the YANG data model scheme for the security posture
   assessment of the network infrastructure device by brokering of YANG
   push telemetry via SACM statements.  The basic steps are:

   o  use YANG push mechanism[I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]to collect the
      created streams of notifications (telemetry)
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]providing SACM content
      on SACM data plane, and the filter expressions used in the context
      of YANG subscriptions constitute SACM content that is imperative
      guidance consumed by SACM components on SACM management plane;

   o  then encapsulate the above YANG push output into a SACM Content
      Element envelope, which is again encapsulated in a SACM statement
      envelope;

   o  lastly, publish the SACM statement into a SACM domain via xmpp-
      grid publisher.

   In this document, we follow the same way as [I-D.ietf-birkholz-sacm-
   yang-content] to define the YANG output for network infrastructure
   device security baseline posture based on the SACM information model
   definition [I-D.ietf-sacm-information-model].

1.3.  Summary

   The following contents propose part of the security baseline YANG
   output for network infrastructure device: control plane security
   baseline.  The companion documents [I-D.ietf- xia-sacm-nid-dp-
   security-baseline], [I-D.ietf-lin-sacm-nid-mp-security-baseline], [I-
   D.ietf-xia-sacm-nid-app-infr-layers-security-baseline] cover other
   parts of the security baseline YANG output for network infrastructure
   device respectively: control plane security baseline, management
   plane security baseline, application layer and infrastructure layer
   security baseline.

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

4.  Data Model Structure

   A large amount of control protocols such as the typical TCP/IP stack
   and BGP in the control plane of network infrastructure device provide
   many operational services (i.e. farwording behavior control).  These
   control protocols could be either the target under attack or the
   medium to attack the devices.  The security baseline of several
   widely used protocols are specified in this section.

4.1.  BGP

   In a BGP network, TCP is always selected as the transport layer
   protocol.  Thus it always subject to most of the attacks that
   targeting TCP-based protocols.  In order to secure the BGP network,
   three types of functions, namely the GTSM, the RPKI, and the BGP peer
   connection authentication, could be configured in network device.
   This section specifies the authentication and RPKI configurations.
   The GTSM is summarized in another individual section together with
   some other protocols that all supports GTSM.

   Various kinds of authentication techniques are able to be used for
   securing the TCP connections between BGP neighbors.  They only allows
   the authorized peers to establish neighbor relationship with local
   device so that the information exchanged between the BGP neighbors
   via the TCP connection cannot be altered.

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is usually applied in a
   network equipt with a RPKI server to secure the inter-domain BGP
   routing.  The device is required to establish a connection to the
   RPKI server and then downloads or updates the Route Origin
   Authorizations (ROAs), which links certain IP prefixes or prefix
   range with an autonomous system (AS), from the RPKI server.  After
   that, the received BGP route information is validated against the
   downloaded/updated ROAs to verify whether the BGP prefixe originates
   from the expected AS.

4.2.  OSPF

   There are a number of ways for spoofing procotol packet to attack
   OSPF protocol.  One possible scenario is that the rogue device inject
   manipulated routing information to cause a Denial-of-Service attack.

   Authentication has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to identify
   and drop these spoofing packets to protect OSPF protocol and secure
   the connection between the OSPF neighbors.  A widely range of
   authentication methods can be deployed in a network device such as
   MD5, HAMC-MD5, and keychain.  As shown in the following tree diagram,
   the authentication can be deployed in either area or interface basis.

4.3.  IS-IS

   IS-IS optional checksum function adds the a checksum TLV in SNP and
   hello packet.  The device firstly check the correctness of checksum
   TVL when it receive the packet.  It secure the data in data link
   layer.

   IS-IS authentication encapsulate the authentication information in
   hello packet, LSP packet, and SNP packet.  Only the packets passed
   the verification will be further processed.  The IS-IS authentication
   is mainly used to secure packet in network layer.

4.4.  MPLS

   RSVP authentication is suggested to configure in the device in order
   to improve the network security and protect the local device against
   the malicious attack.  It prevent the establishment of illegal RSVP
   peer connection in the following situation

      The peer was unauthorized to establish connection with local
      device;

      The attacker establish connection with locol device via spoofing
      RSVP packet.

   Furthermore, it introduce a few enhancement to verify the lifetime,
   handshake and message window size for protection of RSVP against the
   playback attack and the termination of authentication relationships
   caused by packet out of order problem.

   As shown in the tree diagram, the LDP also support MD5 and keychain
   authentication.

4.5.  Keychain

   Authentication is a widely used technique to ensure the packet
   information are not been changed/altered by attackers.  It requires
   the information sender and receiver to share the authentication
   information including the key and algorithm.  In addition, the key
   pairs cannot be delivered in the network (symmetric).  However, in
   order to improve the its reliability, the encryption algorithm and
   the keys have to be renewed dynamically.  It is a complicated and
   time consuming process to change the keys and algorithm for all the
   used protocols manually.  The keychain provide an solution to renew
   the authentication keys and algorithm periodically in a dynamic
   fashion.

4.6.  GTSM

   Attackers send a large amount of forging packets to a target network
   device.  Then the forging packets are delivered to the cpu
   straigtforward when the destinations are correctly checked.  The CPU
   will be overloaded owning to processing such a number of protocol
   packets.  In order to protect the CPU against the CPU utilization
   attack, a GTSM (generized TTL security mechanism) function is
   configured to check the TTL (time to live) in the IP head.  The
   packets will send to cpu for further processing only if the TTL
   number is whithin a pre-defined range.

   As shown in the three diagram in the following figure, the GTSM
   function is configured separately for individual procotols.  Each of
   the protocols, even each list instances in a protocol, has its own
   pre-defined TTL range.
