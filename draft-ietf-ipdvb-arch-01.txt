    Abstract
       
    This document describes an architecture for the transport of IP
    Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS has
    been widely accepted not only for providing digital TV services, 
    but also as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks. 
    Examples of systems using MPEG-2 include the Digital Video 
    Broadcast (DVB) and Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC)
    Standards for Digital Television. 
       
    The document identifies the need for a set of Internet standards
    defining the interface between the MPEG-2 Transport Stream and an 
    IP subnetwork. It suggests a new encapsulation method for IP
    datagrams and proposes protocols to perform IPv6/IPv4 address
    resolution, to associate IP packets with the properties of the
    Logical Channels provided by an MPEG-2 TS.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 Networks
    September 2004
        
    1. Introduction
       
    This document identifies requirements and an architecture for 
    transport of IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG2].
    The prime focus is the efficient and flexible delivery of IP 
    services over those subnetworks that use the MPEG-2 transport
    stream.  
       
    The architecture is designed to be compatible with services
    based on MPEG-2, for example the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB)
    architecture, the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC)
    system [ATSC; ATSC-G], and other similar MPEG-2 based transmission
    systems. Such systems typically provide unidirectional (simplex)
    physical and link layer standards, and have been defined for a wide
    range of physical media (e.g. Terrestrial TV [ETSI-DVBT; ATSC-PSIP-
    TC], Satellite TV [ETSI-DVBS; ATSC-S] and Cable Transmission [ETSI-
    DVBC; ATSC-PSIP-TC]).

    Although many MPEG-2 systems carry a mixture of data types, MPEG-2
    components may, and are, also used to build IP-only networks.
    Standard system components offer advantages of improved 
    interoperability and larger deployment. However, often, MPEG-2 
    networks do not implement all parts of a DVB / ATSC system,
    and may for instance support minimal, or no, signalling of
    Service Information (SI) tables.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 Networks
    September 2004


    1.1 Salient Features of the Architecture
       
    The architecture defined in this document describes a set of 
    protocols that support transmission of IP packets over the MPEG-2
    TS. Key characteristics of these networks are that they may 
    Provide link-level broadcast capability, and that many supported 
    applications require access to a very large number of subnetwork
    nodes.
    
    Some or all of these protocols may also be applicable to other
    subnetworks, e.g., other MPEG-2 transmission networks, regenerative
    satellite links [ETSI-BSM], and some types of broadcast wireless 
    links. The key goals of the architecture are to reduce complexity 
    when using the system, while improving performance, increasing 
    flexibility for IP services, and providing opportunities for better
    integration with IP services.
       
    Since a majority of MPEG-2 transmission networks are
    bandwidth-limited, encapsulation protocols must therefore add
    minimal overhead to ensure good link efficiency while providing 
    adequate network services. They also need to be simple to minimize
    processing, robust to errors and security threats, and extensible
    to a wide range of services. 
       
    In MPEG-2 systems, TS Logical Channels provide multiplexing,
    addressing, and error reporting. The TS Logical Channel may also be
    used to provide Quality of Service (QoS). Mapping functions are
    required to relate TS Logical Channels to IP addresses, to map TS 
    Logical Channels to IP-level QoS, and to associate IP flows with 
    specific subnetwork capabilities.  An important feature of the 
    architecture is that these functions may be provided in a dynamic
    way, allowing transparent integration with other IP-layer
    protocols. Collectively, these will form a MPEG-2 TS address 
    resolution protocol suite.

    stuffing over an MPEG-2 Multiplex [ISO-MPEG]. 
       
    ATSC: Advanced Television Systems Committee [ATSC]. A framework 
    and a set of associated standards for the transmission of video, 
    audio, and data using the ISO MPEG-2 standard.
       
    DSM-CC: Digital Storage Media Command and Control [ISO-DSMCC].
    A format for transmission of data and control information defined 
    by the ISO MPEG-2 standard that is carried in an MPEG-2 Private 
    Section.

    PES: Packetized Elementary Stream. A format of MPEG-2 TS packet
    payload usually used for video or audio information in MPEG-2
    [ISO-MPEG].


    PID: Packet Identifier. A 13 bit field carried in the header of TS 
    Packets. This is used to identify the TS Logical Channel to which a 
    TS Packet belongs [ISO-MPEG]. The TS Packets forming the parts of a 
    Table Section, PES, or other payload unit must all carry the same 
    PID value.  The all 1s PID value (0x1FFF in hexadecimal) indicates
    a Null TS Packet introduced to maintain a constant bit rate of a
    TS Multiplex.  
    
    PP: Payload Pointer. An optional one byte pointer that directly 
    follows the TS Packet header. It contains the number of bytes 
    between the end of the TS Packet header and the start of a Payload 
    Unit. The presence of the Payload Pointer is indicated by the value 
    of the PUSI bit in the TS Packet header. The Payload Pointer is 
    present in DSM-CC, and Table Sections, it is not present in TS 
    Logical Channels that use the PES-format.

    PUSI: Payload_Unit_Start_Indicator of MPEG-2 [ISO-MPEG]. A single 
    bit flag carried in the TS Packet header. A PUSI value of 0 
    indicates that the TS Packet does not carry the start of a new 
    Payload Unit. A PUSI value of 1 indicates that the TS Packet does 
    carry the start of a new Payload Unit. In ULE, a PUSI bit set to 1 
    also indicates the presence of a one byte Payload Pointer (PP). 


    PRIVATE SECTION: A syntactic structure used for mapping all 
    service information (e.g. an SI table) into TS Packets.  A table 
    may be divided into a number of sections.  All sections of a table
    must be carried over a single TS Logical Channel.


    PSI: Program Specific Information. Tables used to convey information 
    about the service carried in a TS Multiplex. The set of PSI tables 
    is defined by [ISO-MPEG], see also SI Table. 
       
    Receiver: An equipment that processes the signal from a TS Multiplex
    and performs filtering and forwarding of encapsulated PDUs to the 
    network-layer service (or bridging module when operating at the link 
    layer).


    SI TABLE: Service Information Table. In this document, the term is
    used to describe any table used to convey information about the
    service carried in a TS Multiplex (e.g. [ISO-MPEG]). SI tables are
    carried in MPEG-2 Private Sections. 


    SNDU: Subnetwork Data Unit. An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2 
    Payload Unit.

    STB: Set-Top Box. A consumer equipment (Receiver) for reception of
    digital TV services.


    TABLE SECTION: A Payload Unit carrying a part of a MPEG-2 SI Table. 


    TS: Transport Stream [ISO-MPEG], a method of transmission at the
    MPEG-2 level using TS Packets; it represents level 2 of the ISO/OSI
    reference model. See also TS Logical Channel and TS Multiplex.
    
    TS HEADER: The 4 byte header of a TS Packet. 


    TS LOGICAL CHANNEL: Transport Stream Logical Channel, a channel 
    identified at the MPEG-2 level [ISO-MPEG]. It exists at level 2 of 
    the ISO/OSI reference model. All packets sent over a TS Logical 
    Channel carry the same PID value. According to MPEG-2, some TS 
    Logical Channels are reserved for specific signalling purposes. 
    Other standards (e.g., ATSC, DVB) also reserve specific TS Logical 
    Channels.        


    TS MULTIPLEX: A set of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels sent over a single 
    common physical link (i.e. a transmission at a specified symbol 
    rate, FEC setting, and transmission frequency). The same TS Logical 
    Channel may be repeated over more than one TS Multiplex, for example 
    to redistribute the same multicast content to two terrestrial TV 
    transmission cells.     


    TS PACKET: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over a TS Multiplex 
    [ISO-MPEG]. Each TS Packet carries a 4B header, plus optional 
    overhead including an Adaptation Field, encryption details and time 
    stamp information to synchronise a set of related Transport Streams.
    It is also referred to as a TS_cell. Each TS packet carries a PID 
    value to associate it with a single TS Logical Channel.

    September 2004
    


    3. Architecture
       
    The following sections introduce the components of the MPEG-2
    Transmission Network and relate these to a networking framework.
       
    3.1 MPEG-2 Transmission Networks
    
    There are many possible topologies for the MPEG-2 Transmission
    Networks. A number of example scenarios are briefly described 
    below, and the following text relates specific functions to this
    set of scenarios.
 
    A) Broadcast TV and Radio Delivery
    The principal service in the Broadcast TV and Radio Delivery
    scenario is Digital TV and/or Radio and their associated data [ID-
    MMUSIC-IMG, ETSI-IPDC]. Such networks typically contain two
    components: the contribution feed and the broadcast part.
    Contribution feeds provide communication from a typically small
    number of individual sites (usually at high quality) to the Hub of a 
    broadcast network. The traffic carried on contribution feeds is
    typically encrypted, and is usually processed prior to being resent 
    on the Broadcast part of the network. The Broadcast part uses a star
    topology centred on the Hub to reach a typically large number of
    down-stream Receivers. Although such networks may provide IP 
    transmission, they do not necessarily provide access to the public
    Internet.
       
    B) Broadcast Networks used as an ISP 
    Another scenario resembles that above, but includes the provision of
    IP services providing access to the public Internet. The IP traffic 
    in this scenario is typically not related to the digital TV/Radio 
    content, and the service may be operated by an independent operator
    such as uni-directional file delivery or bi-directional ISP access. 
    The IP service must adhere to the full system specification used 
    for the broadcast transmission, including allocation of PIDs, and
    generation of appropriate MPEG-2 control information (e.g. DVB and
    ATSC SI tables).
       
    C) Uni-directional Star IP Scenario 
    The Uni-directional Star IP Scenario utilises a Hub station to
    provide a data network delivering a common bit stream to 
    medium-sized groups of Receivers. MPEG-2 transmission technology 
    provides the forward direction physical and link layers for this 
    transmission, the return link (if required) is provided by other
    means. IP services typically form the main proportion of the 
    transmission traffic. Such networks do not necessarily implement
    the MPEG-2 control plane, i.e. PSI/SI tables.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 Networks
    September 2004


    D) Data-cast Overlay
    The Data-cast Overlay scenario employs MPEG-2 physical and link
    layers to provide additional connectivity such as uni-directional
    multicast to supplement an existing IP-based Internet service.
    Examples of such a network includes IP Datacast to mobile wireless
    receivers [ID-MMUSIC-IMG].


    E) Point-to-Point Links 
    Point-to-Point connectivity may be provided using a pair of 
    transmit and receive interfaces supporting the MPEG-2 physical and
    link layers.  Typically the transmission from a sender is received
    by only one or a small number of Receivers. Examples 
    include the use of transmit/receive DVB-S terminals to provide 
    satellite links between ISPs utilising BGP routing.


    F) Two-Way IP Networks
    Two-Way IP networks are typically satellite-based and star-based
    utilising a Hub station to deliver a common bit stream to 
    medium-sized groups of receivers. A bi-directional service is 
    provided over a common air-interface. The transmission technology
    in the forward direction at the physical and link layers is MPEG-2,
    which may also be used in the return direction. Such systems also 
    usually include a control plane element to manage the (shared) 
    return link capacity. A concrete example is the DVB-RCS system
    [ETSI-DVBRCS]. IP services typically form the main proportion of the 
    transmission traffic.
       
    Scenarios A-D employ uni-directional MPEG-2 Transmission Networks.
    For satellite-based networks, these typically have a star topology,
    with a central Hub providing service to large numbers of down-stream
    Receivers. Terrestrial networks may employ several transmission Hubs
    each serving a particular coverage cell with a community of
    Receivers.
       
    From an IP viewpoint, the service is typically either
    uni-directional multicast, or a bi-directional service in which some
    complementary link technology (e.g. Modem, LMDS, GPRS, ...) is used
    to provide the return path from Receivers to the Internet. Routing
    in this case could be provided using Uni-Directional Link Routing
    (UDLR) [RFC3077].
       
    Note that only Scenarios A-B actually carry MPEG-2 video and audio
    intended for reception by digital Set Top Boxes (STBs) as the
    primary traffic. The other scenarios are IP-based data networks and
    need not necessarily implement the MPEG-2 control plane.
       
    Scenarios E-F provide two-way connectivity using the MPEG-2
    Transmission Network.  Such networks provide direct support for
    bi-directional protocols above and below the IP layer.

    The complete MPEG-2 transmission network may be managed by a
    transmission service operator. In such cases, the assignment of
    addresses and TS Logical Channels at Receivers are usually under 
    the control of the service operator.  Examples include a TV 
    operator (Scenario A), or an ISP (Scenarios B-F).  MPEG-2 
    transmission networks are also used for private networks. These 
    typically involve a smaller number of Receivers and do not require 
    the same level of centralised control. Examples include companies 
    wishing to connect DVB-capable routers to form links within the 
    Internet (Scenario B).
    
    3.2 TS Logical Channels
       
    An MPEG-2 Transport Multiplex offers a number of parallel channels,
    which are known here as TS Logical Channels.  Each TS Logical
    Channel is uniquely identified by the Packet ID, PID, value that is
    Carried in the header of each MPEG-2 TS Packet. The PID value is a
    13 bit field and, thus the number of available channels ranges from
    0 to 8191 decimal or 0x1FFF in hexadecimal, some of which being
    reserved for transmission of SI tables. Non-reserved TS Logical 
    Channels may be used to carry audio [ISO-AUD], video [ISO-VID], IP
    packets [ISO-DSMCC; ETSI-DAT; ATSC-DAT],or other data [ISO-DSMCC;
    ETSI-DAT; ATSC-DAT]. The value 8191 decimal(0x1FFF) indicates a null
    packet, used to maintain the physical bearer bit rate when there are 
    no other MPEG-2 TS packets to be sent.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 Networks
    September 2004


    TS Logical Channels are independently numbered on each MPEG-2 TS
    Multiplex (MUX).  In most cases the data sent over the TS Logical
    Channels will differ for different multiplexes. Figure 2
    shows a set of TS Logical Channels sent using two MPEG-2 TS
    Multiplexes (A and B). 
       
    There are cases where the same data may be distributed over two or
    more multiplexes (e.g., some SI tables; multicast content which
    needs to be received by Receivers tuned to either MPEG-2 TS; unicast
    data were the Receiver may be in either/both two potentially
    overlapping MPEG-2 transmission cells). In figure 2, each multiplex
    carries 3 MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels. These TS Logical Channels may
    differ (TS-LC-A-1, TS-LC-A-2, TS-LC-B-2, TS-LC-B-1), or may be
    common to both MPEG-2 TS Multiplexes (i.e. TS-LC-A-3 and TS-LC-B-3
    carry identical content).
       
    As can been seen, there are similarities between the way PIDs
    are used and the operation of virtual channels in ATM. However,
    unlike ATM, a PID defines a unidirectional broadcast channel and not
    a point-to-point link. Contrary to ATM, there is, as yet, no
    specified standard interface for MPEG-2 connection setup, or for
    signalling mappings of IP flows to PIDs, or to set the Quality of
    Service, QoS, assigned to a TS Logical Channel.
       
    3.3 Multiplexing and Re-Multiplexing
       
    In a simple example, one or more TS are processed by a MPEG-2
    multiplexor resulting in a TS Multiplex. The TS Multiplex is
    forwarded over a physical bearer towards one or more Receivers
    (figure 3). 


    In a more complex example, the same TS may be fed to multiple MPEG-2
    multiplexors and these may, in turn, feed other MPEG-2 multiplexors
    (remultiplexing). Remultiplexing may occur in several places (and is
    common in Scenarios A and B of section 3.1). One example is a 
    satellite that provides on-board processing of the TS packets,
    multiplexing the TS Logical Channels received from one or more 
    uplink physical bearers (TS Multiplex) to one (or more in the case
    of broadcast/multicast) down-link physical bearer (TS Multiplex). As
    part of the remultiplexing process, a remultiplexor may renumber the
    PID values associated with one or more TS Logical Channels to
    prevent clashes between input TS Logical Channels with the same PID
    carried on different input multiplexes. It may also modify and/or
    insert new SI data into the control plane.
       
    In all cases, the final result is a "TS Multiplex" which is
    transmitted over the physical bearer towards the Receiver.

    3.4 IP Datagram Transmission 
       
    Packet data for transmission over an MPEG-2 Transport Multiplex is
    passed to an Encapsulator, sometimes known as a Gateway.  This
    receives Protocol Data Units, PDUs, such as Ethernet frames or IP
    packets, and formats each into a Sub-Network Data Unit, SNDU, by
    adding an encapsulation header and trailer (see section 4). The
    SNDUs are subsequently fragmented into a series of TS Packets.
       
    To receive IP packets over a MPEG-2 TS Multiplex, a Receiver
    needs to identify the specific TS Multiplex (physical link) and also
    the TS Logical Channel (the PID value of a logical link). It is
    common for a number of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels to carry SNDUs,
    and a Receiver must therefore filter (accept) IP packets sent with a
    number of PID values, and must independently reassemble each SNDU.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004


    A Receiver that simultaneously receives from several TS Logical
    Channels, must filter other unwanted TS Logical Channels by
    employing for example specific hardware support. Packets for one IP
    flow (i.e. a specific combination of IP source and destination
    addresses) must be sent using the same PID. It should not be assumed
    that all IP packets are carried on a single PID, as in some cable
    modem implementations, and multiple PIDs must be allowed in the
    architecture. Many current hardware filters limit the maximum number
    of active PIDs (e.g. 32), although if needed, future systems may
    reasonably be expected to support more.  
       
    In some cases, Receivers may need to select TS Logical Channels from
    a number of simultaneously active TS Multiplexes. To do this, they
    need multiple physical receive interfaces (e.g., RF front-ends and
    demodulators). Some applications also envisage the concurrent 
    reception of IP Packets over other media that may not necessarily
    use MPEG-2 transmission. 
       
    Bi-directional (duplex) transmission can be provided using a MPEG-2
    Transmission Network by using one of a number of alternate return
    channel schemes [DVB-RC]. Duplex IP paths may also be supported
    using non-MPEG-2 return links (e.g. in Scenarios B-D of section
    3.1). One example of such an application is that of Uni-Directional
    Link Routing, UDLR [RFC3077].
       
    3.5 Motivation


    The network layer protocols to be supported by this architecture
    include:
       (i) IPv4 Unicast packets, destined for a single end host
       (ii) IPv4 Broadcast packets, sent to all end systems in an IP
       network
       (iii) IPv4 Multicast packets
       (iv) IPv6 Unicast packets, destined for a single end host
       (v) IPv6 Multicast packets
       (vi) Packets with compressed IPv4 / IPv6 packet headers (e.g.
       [RFC2507; RFC3095])
       (vii) Bridged Ethernet frames
       (viii) Other network protocol packets (MPLS, potential new
        protocols)


    The architecture will provide:    
    (i)  Guidance on which MPEG-2 features are pre-requisites for the IP
         service, and identification of any optional fields that impact
         performance/correct operation.  
    (ii) Standards to provide an efficient and flexible encapsulation
         scheme that may be easily implemented in an Encapsulator or
         Receiver. The payload encapsulation requires a type field for
         the SNDU to indicate the type of packet and a mechanism to
         signal which encapsulation is used on a certain PID.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004


    (iii) Standards to associate a particular IP address with a Network
          Point of Attachment (NPA) that could or may not be a MAC
          Address. This process resembles the IPv4 Address Resolution
          Protocol, ARP, or IPv6 Neighbour Discovery, ND, protocol [AR-
          DRAFT]. In addition, the standard will be compatible with IPv6
          autoconfiguration.  
    (iv) Standards to associate a MPEG-2 TS interface with one or more
         specific TS Logical Channels (PID, TS Multiplex). Bindings are
         required for both unicast transmission, and multicast 
         reception. In the case of IPv4, this must also support network 
         broadcast. To make the schemes robust to loss and state changes 
         within the MPEG-2 transmission network, a soft-state approach
         may prove desirable.  
    (v)  Standards to associate the capabilities of a MPEG-2 TS Logical
         Channel with IP flows. This includes mapping of QoS functions,
         such as IP QoS/DSCP and RSVP, to underlying MPEG-2 TS QoS,
         multi-homing and mobility. This capability could be associated
         by the AR standard proposed above.
    (vi) Guidance on Security for IP transmission over MPEG-2. The
         framework must permit use of IPsec and clearly identify any
         security issues concerning the specified protocols. The
         security issues need to consider two cases: unidirectional 
         transfer (in which communication is only from the sending IP
         end host to the receiving IP end host) and bi-directional
         transfer. Consideration should also be given to security of the
         TS Multiplex: the need for closed user groups and the use of 
         MPEG-2 TS encryption. 
    (vii) Management of the IP transmission, including standardised SNMP
          MIBs and error reporting procedures. The need for and scope of
          this is to be determined. 



    The specified architecture and techniques should be suited to a
    Range of systems employing the MPEG-2 TS, and may also suit other
    (sub)networks offering similar transfer capabilities.
     


    The following section, 4, describes encapsulation issues.

    4. Encapsulation Protocol Requirements
       
    This section identifies requirements and provides examples of
    mechanisms that may be used to perform the encapsulation of IPv4/v6
    unicast and multicast packets over MPEG-2 Transmission Networks.


    A network device, known as an Encapsulator receives PDUs (e.g. IP 
    Packets or Ethernet frames) and formats these Subnetwork Data Units, 
    SNDUs. An encapsulation (or convergence) protocol transports each 
    SNDU over the MPEG-2 TS service and provides the appropriate 
    mechanisms to deliver the encapsulated PDU to the Receiver IP
    interface. 


    In forming a SNDU, the encapsulation protocol typically adds
    header fields that carry protocol control information, such
    as the length of SNDU, Receiver address, multiplexing information,
    payload type, sequence numbers etc.  The SNDU payload is typically
    followed by a trailer, which carries an Integrity Check (e.g.,
    Cyclic Redundancy Check, CRC). Some protocols also add additional
    control information and/or padding to or after the trailer 
    (figure 4).

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004



    The DVB family of standards currently defines a mechanism for
    transporting an IP packet, or Ethernet frame using the
    Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) [ETSI-DAT]. This scheme is also
    supported in ATSC [ATSC-DAT; ATSC-DATG]. It allows transmission
    of IP packets or (by using LLC) Ethernet frames by encapsulation
    within a Table Section (with the format used by the control plane
    associated with the MPEG-2 transmission). The MPE specification
    includes a set of optional header components and requires
    decoding of the control headers.  This processing is suboptimal
    for Internet traffic, since it incurs significant receiver
    processing overhead and some extra link overhead [CLC99].
       
    The existing standards carry heritage from legacy implementations. 
    These have reflected the limitations of technology at the time of 
    their deployment (v.g. design decisions driven by audio/video
    considerations rather than IP networking requirements). IPv6, MPLS,
    and other network-layer protocols are not natively supported.
    Together, these justify the development of a new encapsulation
    that will be truly IP-centric. Carrying IP packets over a TS
    Logical Channel involves several convergence protocol functions. 
    This section briefly describes these functions and highlights the
    requirements for a new encapsulation.


    4.1 Payload_Unit Delimitation
       
    MPEG-2 indicates the start of a Payload Unit (PU) in a new TS Packet 
    with a "start_of_payload_unit_indicator" (PUSI) [ISO-MPEG] carried 
    in the 4B TS Packet header. The PUSI is a 1 bit flag that has 
    normative meaning [ISO_MPEG] for TS Packets that carry PES Packets 
    or PSI/SI data. 
       
    When the payload of a TS Packet contains PES data, a PUSI value of
    '1' indicates the TS Packet payload starts with the first byte of a
    PES Packet. A value of '0' indicates that no PES Packet starts in
    the TS Packet. If the PUSI is set to '1', then one, and only one,
    PES Packet starts in the TS Packet. 
       
    When the payload of the TS Packet contains PSI data, a PUSI value of
    '1' indicates the first byte of the TS Packet payload carries a
    Payload Pointer (PP) that indicates the position of the first byte 
    of the Payload Unit (Table Section) being carried; if the TS Packet 
    does not carry the first byte of a Table Section, the PUSI is set to 
    '0', indicating that no Payload Pointer is present. 
       
    Using this PUSI bit, the start of the first Payload Unit in a TS
    Packet is exactly known by the Receiver, unless that TS Packet has
    been corrupted or lost in the transmission. In which case, the
    payload is discarded until the next TS Packet is received with a
    PUSI value of '1'.

    The encapsulation should allow packing of more than one SNDU into
    the same TS Packet and should not limit the number of SNDUs that can
    be sent in a TS Packet.  In addition, it should allow an IP
    Encapsulator to insert padding when there is an incomplete TS Packet
    payload. A mechanism needs to be identified to differentiate this
    padding from the case where another encapsulated SNDU follows. 
       
    A combination of the PUSI and a Length Indicator (see below) allows
    an efficient MPEG-2 convergence protocol to receive accurate
    delineation of packed SNDUs.  The MPEG-2 standard [ISO_MPEG] does
    not specify how private data should use the PUSI bit. 
       
    4.2 Length Indicator
       
    Most services using MPEG-2 include a length field in the Payload
    Unit header to allow the Receiver to identify the end of a Payload 
    Unit (e.g. PES Packet, Section, or an SNDU).
       
    When parts of more than two Payload Units are carried in the same TS
    Packet, only the start of the first is indicated by the Payload
    Pointer. Placement of a Length Indicator in the encapsulation header
    allows a Receiver to determine the number of bytes until the start
    of the next encapsulated SNDU. This placement also provides the
    opportunity for the Receiver to pre-allocate an appropriate-sized
    memory buffer to receive the reassembled SNDU.
       
    A Length Indicator is required, and should be carried in the
    encapsulation header.  This should support SNDUs of at least the MTU
    size offered by Ethernet (currently 1500 bytes). Although the IPv4 
    and IPv6 packet format permits an IP packet of size up to 64 KB, 
    such packets are seldom seen on the current Internet. Since high 
    speed links are often limited by the packet forwarding rate of 
    routers, there has been a tendency for Internet core routers to
    support MTU values larger than 1500 bytes. A value of 16 KB is not
    uncommon in the core of the current Internet.  This would seem a
    suitable maximum size for an MPEG-2 transmission network.
       
    4.3 Next Level Protocol Type
       
    A key feature of the new encapsulation is to identify the type of
    payload being transported (e.g., to differentiate IPv4, IPv6 etc).
    Most protocols use a type field to identify a specific process at
    the next higher layer that is the originator or the recipient of the
    payload (SNDU). This method is used by IPv4, IPv6, and also by the
    original Ethernet protocol (DIX). OSI uses the concept of a
    'Selector' for this, (e.g. in the IEEE 802/ISO 8802 standards for
    CSMA/CD [LLC], although in this case a SNAP (subnetwork access
    protocol) header is also required for IP packets.
       
    A Next Level Protocol Type field is also required if compression
    (e.g. Robust Header Compression [RFCROHC]) is supported. No

    compression method has currently been defined that is directly
    applicable to this architecture, however the ROHC framework 
    defines a number of header compression techniques that may yield
    considerable improvement in throughput on links which have a limited 
    capacity.


    Since many MPEG-2 Transmission Networks are wireless, the ROHC
    framework will be directly applicable for many applications. The
    benefit of ROHC is greatest for smaller SNDUs but does not imply 
    the need for additional processing at the Receiver to expand the
    received compressed packets. The selected type field should contain
    sufficient code points to support this technique.
       
    It is thus a requirement to include a Next Level Protocol Type field
    in the encapsulation header.  Such a field should specify values for
    at least IPv4, IPv6, and must allow for other values (e.g., MAC-
    level bridging).
       
    4.4 L2 Subnet Addressing
       
    In MPEG-2, the PID carried in the TS Packet header is used to
    identify individual services with the help of SI tables. This was
    primarily intended as a unidirectional (simplex) broadcast system.
    A TS Packet stream carries either tables or one PES Packet stream
    (i.e., compressed video or audio). Individual Receivers are not
    addressable at this level.
       
    IPv4 and IPv6 allocate addresses to end hosts and intermediate
    systems (routers). Each system (or interface) is identified by a
    globally assigned address.  ISO uses the concept of a hierarchically
    structured Network Service Access Point (NSAP) address to identify
    an end host user process in an Internet environment. 
 
    Within a local network a completely different set of addresses for
    the Network Point of Attachment (NPA) is used; frequently these NPA
    addresses are referred to as Medium Access Control, MAC-level
    addresses. In the Internet they are also called hardware addresses.
    Whereas network layer addresses are used for routing, NPA addresses
    are primarily used for Receiver identification.
 
    Receivers may use the NPA of a received SNDU to reject unwanted
    unicast packets within the (software) interface driver at the
    Receiver, but must also perform forwarding checks based on the IP
    address. IP multicast and broadcast may also filter based using the
    NPA, but Receivers must also filter unwanted packets at the network
    layer based on source and destination IP addresses.  This does not
    imply that each IP address must map to a unique NPA (more than one
    IP address may map to the same NPA). If a separate NPA address is
    not required, the IP address is sufficient for both functions.

    If it is required to address an individual Receiver in an MPEG-2
    transport system, this can be achieved either at the network level
    (IP address) or via a hardware-level NPA address (MAC-address).  If
    both addresses used, they must be mapped either in a static or a
    dynamic way (e.g., by an address resolution process). A similar
    requirement may also exist to identify the PID and TS multiplex on
    which services are carried. 
       
    Using an NPA address in a MPEG-2 TS may enhance security, in that 
    a particular PDU may be targeted for a particular Receiver by 
    specifying the corresponding Receiver NPA address. This is
    however only a weak form of security, since the NPA filtering is
    often reconfigurable (frequently performed in software), and may be
    modified by a user to allow reception of specified (or all) packets,
    similar to promiscuous mode operation in Ethernet. If security is
    required, it should be applied at another place (e.g. link
    encryption, authentication of address resolution, IPSEC, transport
    level security and/or application level security).
       
    There are also cases where the use of a NPA is required (e.g. where
    a system operates as a router) and if present this should be carried
    in encapsulation header where it may be used by Receivers as a
    pre-filter to discard unwanted SNDUs. The addresses allocated do not
    need to conform to the IEEE MAC address format. There are many cases 
    where a NPA is not required, and network layer filtering may be 
    used. A new encapsulation protocol should therefore support an 
    optional NPA. 


    4.5 Integrity Check
       
    For the IP service, the probability of undetected packet error
    should be small (or negligible) [RFC3819]. There is therefore
    a need for a strong integrity check (e.g. Cyclic Redundancy Check
    or CRC) to verify correctness of a received PDU [RFC3819].
    Such checks should be sufficient to detect incorrect operation of 
    the encapsulator and Receiver (including reassembly errors 
    following loss/corruption of TS Packets), in addition to 
    protecting from loss and/or corruption by the transmission 
    network (e.g., multiplexors and links).
       
    Mechanisms exist in MPEG-2 Transmission Networks that may assist in
    detecting loss (e.g. the 4-bit continuity counter included in the 
    MPEG-2 TS Packet header). 
       
    An encapsulation must provide a strong integrity check for each
    IP packet. The requirements for usage of a link CRC are provided
    in [RFC3819].  To ease hardware implementation, this check should
    be carried in a trailer following the SNDU. A CRC-32 is sufficient
    for operation with up to a 12 KB payload, and may still provide
    adequate protection for larger payloads.

    4.6 Identification of Scope. 
       
    The MPE section header contains information that could be used by
    The Receiver to identify the scope of the (MAC) address carried as a
    NPA, and prevent TS Packets intended for one scope to be received by
    another. Similar functionality may be achieved by ensuring that only
    IP packets that do not have overlapping scope are sent on the same
    TS Logical Channel. In some cases, this may imply the use of
    multiple TS Logical Channels.
       


    4.7 Extension Headers
       
    The evolution of the Internet service may in future require
    additional functions. A flexible protocol should therefore provide a
    way to introduce new features when required, without having to
    provide additional out-of-band configuration.
       
    IPv6 introduced the concept of extension headers that carry extra
    information necessary/desirable for certain subnetworks. The DOCSIS
    cable specification also allows a MAC header to carry extension
    headers to build operator-specific services. It is thus a
    requirement for the new encapsulation to allow extension headers.
       
    4.8 Summary of Requirements for Encapsulation
       
    The main requirements for an IP-centric encapsulation include:
          - support of IPv4 and IPv6 packets
          - support for Ethernet encapsulated packets
          - flexibility to support other IP formats and protocols (e.g.
            ROHC, MPLS)
          - easy implementation using either hardware or software
            processing
          - low overhead/managed overhead
          - a fully specified algorithm that allows a sender to pack
            multiple packets per SNDU and to easily locate packet 
            fragments
          - extensibility
          - compatibility with legacy deployments 
          - ability to allow link encryption, when required
          - capability to support a full network architecture including
            data, control and management planes

    5. Address Resolution Functions
       
    Address Resolution (AR) provides a mechanism that associates L2
    information with the IP address of a system. Many L2 technologies
    employ unicast AR at the sender: an IP system wishing to send an IP
    packet encapsulates it and places it into a L2 frame.  It then
    identifies the appropriate L3 adjacency (e.g. next hop router, end
    host) and determines the appropriate L2 adjacency (e.g. MAC address
    in Ethernet) to which the frame should be sent so that the packet
    gets across the L2 link. 
       
    The L2 addresses discovered using AR are normally recorded in a data
    structure known as the arp/neighbor cache. The results of previous
    AR requests are usually cached. Further AR protocol exchanges may be
    required as communication proceeds to update or re-initialise the
    client cache state contents (i.e. purge/refresh the contents [ND]).
    For stability, and to allow network topology changes and client
    faults, the cache contents are normally "soft state", that is, they
    are aged with respect to time and old entries removed.
       
    In some cases (e.g. ATM, FR, X.25, MPEG-2 and many more), AR
    involves finding other information than the MAC address. This
    includes identifying other parameters required for L2 transmission,
    such as channel IDs (VCs in X.25, VCIs in ATM, or PIDs in MPEG-2
    TS).
       
    Address resolution has different purposes for unicast and multicast.
    Multicast address resolution is not required for many L2 networks,
    but is required where MPEG-2 transmission networks carry IP
    multicast packets using more than one TS Logical Channel.
    
    5.1 Address Resolution for MPEG-2
    
    There are three elements to the L2 information required to perform
    AR before an IP packet is sent over a MPEG-2 TS. These are:
       
       (i)  A Receiver ID (e.g. a 6B MAC/NPA address).
       (ii) A PID or index to find a PID. 
       (iii) Tuner information (e.g. Transmit Frequency of the 
             physical layer of a satellite/broadcast link


    Elements (ii) and (iii) need to be de-referenced via indexes to the
    Service Information (i.e. the Program Map Table, PMT) when the 
    MPEG-2 Transmission Network includes remultiplexors that renumber
    the PID values of the TS Logical Channels that they process. (Note
    that PIDs are not intended to be end-to-end identifiers). However, 
    although such use is common in broadcast TV networks, many private
    networks do not need to employ multiplexors that renumber PIDs 
   (see section 3.2).

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004




    The third element (iii) allows an AR client to resolve to a
    different MPEG TS Multiplex. This is used when there are several
    channels that may be used for communication (i.e. multiple
    outbound/inbound links). In a mesh system, this could be used to
    determine connectivity. This AR information is used in two ways at a
    Receiver:
       
    (i) AR resolves an IP unicast or IPv4 broadcast address to the (MPEG
    TS Multiplex, PID, MAC/NPA address). This allows the Receiver to set
    L2 filters to let traffic pass to the IP layer. This is used for
    unicast, and IPv4 subnet broadcast
       
    (ii) AR resolves an IP multicast address to the (MPEG TS Multiplex,
    PID, MAC/NPA address), and allows the Receiver to set L2 filters
    enabling traffic to pass to the IP layer. A Receiver in a MPEG-2 TS 
    Transmission Network needs to resolve the PID value and the tuning
    associated with a TS Logical Channel and (at least for unicast)
    the destination Receiver NPA address.
        
    A star topology MPEG-2 TS transmission network is illustrated below,
    with two Receivers receiving a forward broadcast channel sent by a
    Hub. (A mesh system has some additional cases.) The forward
    broadcast channel consists of a "TS Multiplex" (a single physical
    bearer) allowing communication with the terminals. These communicate
    using a set of return channels.

    September 2004



    There are three possibilities for unicast AR:


    (1) A system at a Receiver, A, needs to resolve an address of a
    system that is at the Hub;
    (2) A system at a Receiver, A, needs to resolve an address that is
    at another Receiver, B;
    (3) A host at the Hub needs to resolve an address that is at a
    Receiver. The sender (encapsulation gateway), uses AR to provide the
    the MPEG TS Multiplex, PID, MAC/NPA address for sending unicast,
    IPv4 subnet broadcast and multicast packets.


    If the Hub is an IP router, then case (1) and (2) are the same:
    The host at the Receiver does not know the difference.  In these
    cases, the address to be determined is the L2 address of the device
    at the Hub to which the IP packet should be forwarded, and which
    then relays the IP packet back to the forward (broadcast) MPEG-2
    channel after AR (case 3).
       
    If the Hub is a L2 bridge, then case 2 still has to relay the IP
    packet back to the outbound MPEG-2 channel. The AR protocol needs to
    resolve the specific Receiver L2 MAC address of B, but needs to send
    this on a L2 channel to the Hub.  This requires Receivers to be
    informed of the L2 address of other Receivers.
       
    An end host connected to the Hub needs to use the AR protocol to
    resolve the Receiver terminal MAC/NPA address. This requires the AR
    server at the Hub to be informed of the L2 addresses of other
    Receivers.


 
    5.2 Scenarios for MPEG AR
       
    An AR protocol may transmit AR information in three distinct ways:


       (i) An MPEG-2 signalling table transmitted at the MPEG-2 level 
       (e.g. within the control plane using a Table;
       (ii) An MPEG-2 signalling table transmitted at the IP level 
       (no implementations of this are known);
       (iii) An address resolution protocol transported over IP 
       (as in ND for IPv6)
       
    There are three distinct cases in which AR may be used:
       
    (i) Multiple TS-Mux and the use of re-multiplexors; e.g. Digital
    Terrestrial, Satellite TV broadcast multiplexes. Many such systems
    employ remultiplexors that modify the PID values associated with TS
    Logical Channels as they pass through the MPEG-2 transmission
    network (as in Scenario A of Section 3.1).

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004


    (ii) Tuner configuration(s) that are fixed or controlled by some
    other process. In these systems, the PID value associated with a TS
    Logical Channel may be known by the Sender.
    (iii) A service run over one TS Mux (i.e., uses only one PID, for
    example DOCSIS and some current DVB-RCS multicast systems). In these
    systems, the PID value of a TS Logical Channel may be known by the
    Sender.
    
    5.2.1 Table-based AR over MPEG-2
    
    In current deployments of MPEG-2 networks, information about the set
    of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels carried over a TS Multiplex is usually
    distributed via tables (service information, SI) sent using channels
    assigned a specific (well-known) set of PIDs. This was originally
    designed for audio/video distribution to STBs. This design requires
    access to control plane by processing the SI table information 
    (carried in MPEG-2 section format [ISO_DSMCC]). The scheme
    reflects the complexity of delivering and co-ordinating the various
    TS Logical Channels associated with a multimedia TV programme. 
       
    One possible requirement to provide TS multiplex and PID information
    for IP services is to integrate additional information into the
    existing MPEG-2 tables, or to define additional tables specific to
    the IP service. The DVB INT and the A/92 Specification from ATSC
    [ATSC-A92] are examples of the realization of such a requirement.
       
    5.2.2 Table-based AR over IP
       
    AR information could be carried over a TS data channel, (e.g. using
    an IP protocol similar to the Service Announcement Protocol, SAP).
    Implementing this independently of the SI tables, would ease
    implementation, by allowing it to operate on systems where IP
    processing is performed in a software driver. It may also allow the
    technique to be more easily adapted to other similar delivery
    networks. It also is advantageous for networks which use the MPEG-2
    TS, but do not necessarily support audio/video services and
    therefore do not need to provide interoperability with TV
    equipment (e.g. links used solely for connecting IP (sub)networks).
              
    5.2.3. Query/Response AR over IP
       
    A query/response protocol may be used at the IP level (similar to,
    or based on IPv6 Neighbor Advertisements of the ND protocol). The AR
    protocol may operate over an MPEG-2 TS Logical Channel using a
    previously agreed PID (e.g. configured, or communicated using a SI
    table). In this case, the AR could be performed by the target system
    itself (as in arp and nd). This has good soft-state properties, and
    is very tolerant to failures. To find an address, a system sends a
    "query" to the network, and the "target" (or its proxy) replies.

    5.3 Unicast Address Scoping
       
    In some case, an MPEG-2 Transmission Network may support multiple IP
    networks.  If this is the case, it is important to recognise the
    context (scope) within which an address is resolved, to prevent
    packets from one addressed scope leaking into other scopes.
       
    An examples of overlapping IP address assignments is the use of 
    private unicast addresses (e.g. in IPv4, 10/8 prefix; 
    172.16/12 prefix; 192.168/16 prefix). These should be confined to 
    the area to which they are addressed. 
       
    There is also a requirement for multicast address scoping 
    (section 6.2). 
       
    IP packets with these addresses must not be allowed to travel
    outside their intended scope, and may cause unexpected behaviour if
    allowed to do so. In addition, overlapping address assignments can
    arise using level 2 NPA addresses:
       
    (i)    The NPA address must be unique within the TS Logical Channel.
           IEEE MAC addresses used in Ethernet LANs are globally unique.
           If the NPA addresses are not globally unique, the same NPA
           address may be re-used by Receivers in different addressed
           areas. 
    
    (ii)   The NPA broadcast address (all 1s MAC address). Traffic with
           this address should be confined to one addressed area. 
    
    (iii)  Other non-IP protocols may also view sets of MAC multicast
           addresses as link-local, and may produce unexpected results
           if distributed across several private networks.
 
    Reception of unicast packets destined for another addressed area may
    lead to an increase in the rate of received packets by systems
    connected via the network. IP end hosts normally filter received
    unicast IP packets based on their assigned IP address. Reception of
    the additional network traffic may contribute to processing load but
    should not lead to unexpected protocol behaviour. It does however
    introduce a potential Denial of Service (DoS) opportunity.
       
    When the Receiver acts as an IP router, the receipt of such an IP
    packet may lead to unexpected protocol behaviour. This also provides
    a security vulnerability since arbitrary packets may be passed to
    the IP layer.

   5.4 AR Authentication
       
    In many AR designs authentication has been overlooked, because of
    the wired nature of most existing IP networks, which makes it easy
    to control hosts physically connected [RFC3819]. With wireless
    connections, this is changing: unauthorised hosts actually can 
    claim L2 resources. The address resolution client (i.e. Receiver)
    may also need to verify the integrity and authenticity of the
    AR information that it receives. There are trust relationships
    both ways: clients need to know they have a valid server and
    that the resolution is valid. Servers should perform authorisation
    issue before they allow a L2 address to be used.


    The MPEG-2 Transmission Network may also require access control to
    prevent unauthorised use of the TS Multiplex, however, this is
    an orthogonal issue to address resolution.
       
    5.5 Requirements for Unicast AR over MPEG-2
       
    The requirement for AR over MPEG-2 networks include:
       
    (i)    Use of a table based approach to promote AR scaling.  This
           requires definition of the frequency of update and volume of
           AR traffic generated.
    (ii)   Mechanisms to install AR information at the server
           (unsolicited registration).
    (iii)  Mechanisms to verify AR information held at the server
           (solicited responses). Appropriate timer values need to be
           defined.
    (iv)   An ability to purge client AR information (after IP network
           renumbering, etc.).
    (v)    Support of IP subnetwork scoping.
    (vi)   Appropriate security associations to authenticate the sender.

    6. Multicast Support
       
    This section addresses specific issues concerning IPv4 and IPv6
    multicast [RFC1112] over MPEG-2 Transmission Networks. The primary 
    goal of multicast support will be efficient filtering of IP
    multicast packets by the Receiver, and the mapping of IPv4 and 
    IPv6 multicast addresses [RFC3171] onto the associated PID value 
    and TS Multiplex.  
  
    The design should permit a large number of active multicast groups, 
    and should minimise the processing load at the Receiver when 
    filtering and forwarding IP multicast packets. For example, schemes 
    that may be easily implemented in hardware would be beneficial, 
    since these may relieve drivers and operating systems from 
    discarding unwanted multicast traffic [RFC3819].  


    Multicast mechanisms are used at more than one protocol level. The
    upstream router feeding the MPEG-2 Encapsulator may forward
    multicast traffic on the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex using a static or 
    dynamic set of groups. When static forwarding is used, the set
    of IP multicast groups may also be configured or set using SNMP,
    Telnet, etc. A Receiver normally uses either an IP group management
    protocol (IGMP [RFC 3376] for IPv4 or MLD [RFC2710][RFC3810] for
    IPv6) or a multicast routing protocol to establish tables that it
    uses to dynamically enable local forwarding of received groups.  In
    a dynamic case, this group membership information is fed-back to the
    Sender to enable it to start sending new groups and (if required) to 
    Update the tables that it produces for multicast AR.
       
    Appropriate procedures need to identify the correct action when the
    same multicast group is available on more than one TS Logical
    Channel.  This could arise when different end hosts act as senders
    to contribute IP packets with the same IP group destination address.
    The correct behaviour for SSM [RFC3569] addresses must also be 
    considered.
         
    It may also arise when a sender duplicates the same IP group over
    several TS Logical Channels (or even different TS Multiplexes), and
    in this case a Receiver may potentially receive more than one copy
    of the same packet. At the IP level, the host/router may be unaware
    of this duplication.
    
    6.1 Multicast AR Functions
       
    The functions required for multicast AR may be summarised as:


       (i) The Sender needs to know L2 mapping of a multicast group.
       (ii) The Receiver needs to know L2 mapping of a multicast group.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004    


    In the Internet, multicast AR is normally a mapping function rather
    than a one-to-one association using a protocol. In Ethernet, the
    sender maps an IP address to a L2 MAC address, and the Receiver uses
    the same mapping to determine the L2 address to set a L2
    hardware/software filter entry.


    A typical sequence of actions for the dynamic case is:


       L3) Populate the IP L3 membership tables at the Receiver.
       L3) Receivers send/forward IP L3 membership tables to the Hub 
       L3) Dynamic/static forwarding at hub/upstream router of IP L3
       groups
       L2) Populate the IP AR tables at the encapsulator gateway 
           (i.e. Map IP L3 mcast groups to L2 (PIDs))
       L2) Distribute the AR information to Receivers
       L2) Set Receiver L2 multicast filters for IP groups in the
           membership table.
       
    To be flexible AR must associate a TS Logical Channel (PID) not only 
    with a group address, but possibly also a QoS class, and other 
    appropriate MPEG-2 TS attributes. Explicit per group AR to 
    individual L2 addresses is to be avoided.

    6.2 Multicast Address Scoping


    As in unicast, it is important to recognise the context (scope)
    within which a multicast IP address is resolved, to prevent
    packets from one addressed scope leaking into other scopes.
       
    Examples of overlapping IP multicast address assignments, include:
       
     (i)   Some multicast addresses, (e.g., scoped multicast addresses
           [RFC2365] that may be used in private networks). These are 
           only valid within the addressed area (examples for IPv4   
           include: 239/8; 224.0.0/24; 224.0.1/24). Similar cases 
           exist for some IPv6 multicast addresses [RFC2375].


    (ii)   Scoped multicast addresses.  Forwarding of these addresses 
           is controlled by the scope associated with the address.
       
    IP packets with these addresses must not be allowed to travel
    outside their intended scope (se section 5.3). Performing multicast
    AR at the IP level can enable providers to offer independently
    scoped addresses and would need to use multiple Multicast AR 
    servers, one per multicast domain.



    6.3 Requirements for Multicast over MPEG-2
       
    The requirements for supporting multicast include, but are not
    restricted to:
       
       (i)    Encapsulating multicast packets for transmission using a
              MPEG-2 TS.
       (ii)   Mapping IP multicast groups to the underlying MPEG-2 TS
              Logical Channel (PID) and the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex.
       (iii)  Provide AR information to allow a Receiver to locate an 
              IP multicast flow within an MPEG-2 TS Multiplex.
       (iv)   Error Reporting.


    7. Summary
       
    This document describes the architecture for a set of protocols to
    perform efficient and flexible support for IP network services over
    networks built upon the MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS). It also
    describes existing approaches. The focus is on IP networking, the
    mechanisms that are used and their applicability to supporting IP
    unicast and multicast services. 
       
    The requirements for a new encapsulation of IPv4 and IPv6 packets is
    described, outlining the limitations of current methods and the need
    for a streamlined IP-centric approach.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004


       
    The architecture also describes MPEG-2 Address Resolution (AR)
    procedures to allow dynamic configuration of the sender and Receiver
    using an MPEG-2 transmission link/network.  These support IPv4 and
    IPv6 services in both the unicast and multicast modes. Resolution
    protocols will support IP packet transmission using both the
    Multiprotocol Encapsulation (MPE), which is currently
    widely deployed, and also any IETF defined ULE encapsulation
    [ID-IPDVB-ULE].



8. Security Considerations
       
    When the MPEG-2 transmission network is not using a wireline 
    network, the normal security issues relating to the use of wireless
    links for transport of Internet traffic should be considered
    [RFC3819]. 
       
    End-to-end security (including confidentiality, authentication,
    integrity and access control) is closely associated with the end 
    user assets that are protected. This close association cannot be
    ensured when providing security mechanisms only within a subnetwork
    (e.g. an MPEG-2 transmission network).  Several security mechanisms
    that can be used end-to-end have already been deployed in the
    general Internet and are enjoying increasing use. Important examples
    include:


    - The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security, TLS,
       which is primarily used to protect web commerce;
    - Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and S/MIME, primarily used to protect
       and authenticate email and software distributions;
    - The Secure Shell (SSH), used to secure remote access and file
       transfer;
    - IPsec, a general purpose encryption and authentication mechanism
       above IP that can be used by any IP application.
       
    However, subnetwork security is also important [RFC3819] and
    should be encouraged, on the principle that it is better than the
    default situation, which all too often is no security at all.
    Users of especially vulnerable subnets (such as radio/broadcast
    networks and/or shared media Internet access) often have control
    over at most one endpoint - usually a client - and therefore 
    cannot enforce the use of end-to-end mechanisms.
       
    A related role for subnetwork security is to protect users against
    traffic analysis, i.e., identifying the communicating parties (by IP
    or MAC address) and determining their communication patterns, even
    when their actual contents are protected by strong end-to-end
    security mechanisms (this is important for networks such as
    broadcast/radio, where eaves-dropping is easy).

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks 
    September 2004 


    Where it is possible for an attacker to inject traffic into the
    subnetwork control plane, subnetwork security can additionally
    protect the subnetwork assets.  This threat must specifically be
    considered for the protocols used for subnetwork control functions
    (e.g. address resolution, management, configuration). Possible
    threats include theft of service and denial of service; shared media
    subnets tend to be especially vulnerable to such attacks [RFC3819].
    
    Appropriate security functions must therefore be provided for ipdvb
    control protocols [RFC3819], particularly when the control functions
    are provided above the IP-layer using IP-based protocols. Internet
    level security mechanisms (e.g.IPSEC) can mitigate such threats.


    In general, End-to-End security is recommended for users of any
    communication path, especially when it includes a wireless/radio
    or broadcast link, where a range of security techniques already 
    exist. Specification of security mechanisms at the application
    layer, or within the MPEG-2 transmission network are the concerns of
    organisations beyond the IETF. The complexity of any such security
    mechanisms should be considered carefully so that it will not unduly 
    impact IP operations. 
    
    8.1 Link Encryption
       
    Link level encryption of IP traffic is commonly used in
    broadcast/radio links to supplement End-to-End security (e.g.
    provided by SSL, SSH, PGP, IPSec). The encryption and key exchange
    methods vary significantly, depending on the intended application.
    For example, DVB-S/DVB-RCS operated by Access Network Operators
    (ANO) may wish to provide their customers (Internet Service
    Providers, ISP) with security services. Common targeted security
    services are: terminal authentication and data confidentiality (for
    unicast and multicast) between a gateway and Receivers. A common
    objective is to provide the same level of privacy as terrestrial
    links. An ISP may also wish to provide end-to-end security services
    to the end-users (based on the well known mechanisms such as IPSec).
    Therefore it is important to understand that both security solutions
    (ANO-to-ISP and ISP-to-end users) may co-exist.
    
    MPE supports optional link encryption using a pair of bits within
    the MPE protocol header to indicate the use of encryption.  To
    support optional link level encryption, it is recommended that a new
    encapsulation also supports optional encryption of the SNDU payload.
    Furthermore, it may be desirable to encrypt/authenticate some/all of
    the SNDU headers.  The method of encryption and the way in which
    keys are exchanged is beyond the scope of the ULE Specification. 
    However, the specification must provide appropriate code points to
    allow such encryption to be implemented at the link layer.

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004


    Appendix A: MPEG-2 Encapsulation Mechanisms 


    To transmit packet data over an MPEG-2 transmission network requires
    that individual SNDUs (e.g. IPv4, IPv6 packets, or bridged Ethernet
    Frames) are encapsulated using a convergence protocol. The following
    encapsulations are currently standardised for MPEG-2 transmission
    networks:
       
       (i)  Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE).
            The Multi-Protocol Encapsulation, MPE, specification of DVB
            [ETSI-DAT] uses private Sections for the transport of IP
            packets and uses encapsulation that is similar to the IEEE
            LAN/MAN standards [LLC]. Data packets are encapsulated in
            datagram sections that are compliant with the DSMCC section
            format for private data. Some Receivers may exploit section
            processing hardware to perform a first-level filter of the
            packets that arrive at the Receiver. 
               
            The section header also includes fields, which may be used
            by a Receiver to filter datagrams assigned to the same TS
            Logical Channel.  This feature allows several logical
            networks to be established without assigning PID values to
            each of the services. Section filtering is especially well
            suited for TV broadcast environments where remultiplexing
            comes into play.
       
            This encapsulation makes use of a MAC-level Network Point of
            Attachment address. The address format conforms to the
            ISO/IEEE standards for LAN/MAN LLC]. The 48-bit MAC address
            field contains the MAC address of the destination; it is
            distributed over six 8-bit fields, labelled MAC_address_1 to
            MAC_address_6. The MAC_address_1 field contains the most
            significant byte of the MAC address, while MAC_address_6
            contains the least significant byte.  How many of these
            bytes are significant is optional and defined by the value
            of the broadcast descriptor table [SI-DAT] sent separately
            over another MPEG-2 TS within the TS multiplex.
       
            MPE is currently a widely deployed scheme. Due to
            Investments in existing systems, usage is likely to continue
            in current and future MPEG-2 Transmission  Networks.
       
       (ii) Data Piping.


 
            The Data Piping profile [ETSI-DAT] is a minimum overhead,
            simple and flexible profile that makes no assumptions
            concerning the format of the data being sent. In this
            profile, the Receiver is intended to provide PID filtering,
            packet reassembly according to [DVB-SIDAT-368], error
            detection and optional Conditional Access (link encryption).

    INTERNET DRAFT  Architecture for IP transport over MPEG-2 networks
    September 2004


            The specification allows the user data stream to be
            unstructured or organized into packets. The specific    
            structure is transparent to the Receiver. It may conform to
            any protocol, e.g., IP, Ethernet, NFS, FDDI, MPEG-2 PES, 
            etc.
       
     (iii)  Data Streaming.
            The data broadcast specification profile [ETSI-DAT] for PES
            tunnels (Data Streaming) supports unicast and multicast data
            services that require a stream-oriented delivery of data
            packets. This encapsulation maps an IP packet into a single
            PES Packet payload. 
       
            Two different types of PES headers can are selected via the
            stream_id values [ISO-MPEG]. The private_stream_2 value
            permits the use of the short PES header with limited
            overhead, while the private_stream_1 value makes available
            the scrambling control and the timing and clock reference
            features of the PES layer.
