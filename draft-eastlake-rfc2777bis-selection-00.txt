Abstract

   This document describes a method for making random selections in such
   a way that the unbiased nature of the choice is publicly verifiable.
   As an example, the selection of the voting members of the IETF
   Nominations Committee from the pool of eligible volunteers is used.
   Similar techniques would be applicable to other cases.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Verifiable Random Selection              July 2001


1. Introduction

   Under the IETF rules, each year ten people are randomly selected from
   among eligible volunteers to be the voting members of the IETF
   nominations committee (NomCom).  The Nomcom nominates members of the
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and the Internet
   Architecture Board (IAB) as described in [RFC 2727].  The number of
   eligible volunteers in recent years has varied in the approximate
   range of 40 to 100.

   It is highly desirable that the random selection of the voting NomCom
   be done in an unimpeachable fashion so that no reasonable charges of
   bias or favoritism can be brought. This is as much for the protection
   of the selection administrator (currently, the appointed non-voting
   NomCom chair) from suspicion of bias as it is for the protection of
   the IETF.

   A method such that public information will enable any person to
   verify the randomness of the selection meets this criterion.  This
   document gives an example of such a method.



2. General Flow of a Publicly Verifiable Process

   In general, a selection of NomCom members publicly verifiable as
   unbiased or similar selection could follow the three steps given
   below.



2.1 Determination of the Pool

   First, you need to determine the pool from which the selection is to
   be made.

   Volunteers are solicited by the selection administrator.  Their names
   are then passed through the IETF Secretariat to check eligibility.
   (Current eligibility criteria relate to IETF meeting attendance,
   records of which are maintained by the Secretariat.)  The full list
   of eligible volunteers should be made public early enough that a
   reasonable time can be given to resolve any disputes as to who should
   be in the pool, probably a week to ten days.



2.2 Publication of the Algorithm

   The exact algorithm to be used, including the public future sources
   of randomness, is made public.  For example, the members of the final


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Verifiable Random Selection              July 2001


   list of eligible volunteers are ordered by publicly numbering them,
   some public future sources of randomness such as government run
   lotteries are specified, and an exact algorithm is specified whereby
   eligible volunteers are selected based on a strong hash function [RFC
   1750] of these future sources of randomness.



2.3 Publication of Selection

   When the pre-specified sources of randomness produce their output,
   those values plus a summary of the execution of the algorithm for
   selection should be announced so that anyone can verify that the
   correct randomness source values were used and the algorithm properly
   executed. A cut off time for any complaint that the algorithm was run
   with the wrong inputs or not faithfully executed should be specified
   to finalize the output and provide a stable NomCom.



3. Randomness

   The crux of the unbiased nature of the selection is that it is based
   in An exact, predetermined fashion on random information which will
   be revealed in the future and thus can not be known to the person
   specifying the algorithm by which that random information will be
   used to control the selection.  The random information must be such
   that it will be publicly and unambiguously revealed in a timely
   fashion.

   The random sources must not include anything that any reasonable
   person would believe to be under the control or influence of the IETF
   or its components, such as IETF meeting attendance statistics,
   numbers of documents issued, or the like.



3.1 Sources of Randomness

   Examples of good information to use are winning lottery numbers for
   specified runnings of specified lotteries.  Particularly for
   government run lotteries, great care is taken to see that they
   produce random quantities.  Even in the unlikely case one were to
   have been rigged, it would almost certainly be in connection with
   winning money in the lottery, not in connection with IETF use.

   Other possibilities are such things as the daily balance in the US
   Treasury on a specified day, the volume of trading on the New York
   Stock exchange on a specified day, etc. (However, the reference code
   given below will not handle integers that are too large.)  Sporting


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Verifiable Random Selection              July 2001


   events can also be used. (Experience has indicated that stock prices
   are a poor source of unamibuous data due to their not trading on some
   days, megers, delistings, splits, multiple markets, etc.) In all
   cases, great care must be taken to specify exactly what quantities
   are being presumed random and what will be done if their issuance is
   cancelled or delayed.

   It is important that the last source of randomness, chronologically,
   produce a substantial amount of the entropy needed.  If most of the
   randomness has come from the earlier of the specified sources, and
   someone has even limited influence on the final source, they might do
   an exhaustive analysis and exert such influence so as to bias the
   selection in the direction they wanted.  Thus it is best for the last
   source to be an especially strong and unbiased source of a large
   amount of randomness such as a government run lottery.

   It is best not to use too many different sources.  Every additional
   source increases the probability that one or more sources might be
   delayed, cancelled, or just plain screwed up somehow, calling into
   play contingency provisions or, worst of all, creating a situation
   that was not anticipated.  This would either require arbitrary
   judgement by the selection administrator, defeating the randomness of
   the selection, or a re-run of with a new set of sources, causing much
   delay.  A good number of sources is three. Ten is probably is too
   many.



3.2 Skew

   Some of the sources of randomness produce data which is not uniformly
   distributed.  This is certainly true of volumes, prices, and horse
   race results, for example.  However, use of a strong mixing function
   [RFC 1750] will extract the available entropy and produce a hash
   value whose bits, remainder modulo a small divisor, etc., are
   uniformly distributed.



3.3 Entropy Needed

   What we are doing is selection N items without replacement from a
   population of P items.  The number of different ways to do this is as
   follows, where "!" represents the factorial function:

                                    P!
                               -------------
                               N! * (P - N)!

   To do this in a completely random fashion requires as many random


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Verifiable Random Selection              July 2001


   bits as the logarithm base 2 of that quantity.  Some sample
   calculated approximate number of random bits for the selection of 10
   nomcom members from various pool sizes is given below:

                  Random Selection of Ten Items From Pool

   Pool size     20   25   30   35   40   50   60   75  100
   Bits needed   18   22   25   28   30   34   37   40   44

   Using an inadequate number of bits means that not all of the possible
   selections would be available.  For a substantially inadequate amount
   of entropy, there could be a correlation between the selection of two
   different members of the pool, for example.  However, as a practical
   matter, for pool sizes likely to be encountered in IETF Nomcom
   membership selection, 40 bits of entropy should always be adequate.
   Even if there is a large pool and theoretically more bits are needed
   for complete randomness, 40 bits of entropy will assure that the
   probability of selection of each pool member differs from that of
   other pool members, the correlation between the selection of any pair
   of pool members, etc., differs only insignificantly from that for
   completely random selection.

   An MD5 [RFC 1321] hash has 128 bits and therefore can produce no more
   than that number of bits of entropy.  However, this is three times
   what is likely to ever be needed for IETF Nomcom membership
   selection.



4. A Suggested Precise Algorithm

   It is important that a precise algorithm be given for mixing the
   random sources specified and making the selection based thereon.
   Sources suggested above produce either a single positive number
   (i.e., NY Stock Exchange volume in thousands of shares) or a small
   set of positive numbers (many lotteries provide 6 numbers in the
   range of 1 through 40 or the like, a sporting event could produce the
   scores of two teams, etc.).  A sample precise algorithm is as
   follows:

   1. For each source producing multiple numeric values, represent each
      as a decimal number terminated by a period (or with a period
      separating the whole from the fractional part) and without leading
      zeroes (except for a single leading zero if the integer part is
      zero) or trailing zeroes after the period.

   2. Order them from smallest to the largest and concatenate them and
      suffix the result with a "/".  For each source producing a single
      number, simply represent it as above with a suffix "/".



Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 6]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Verifiable Random Selection              July 2001


   3. At this point you have a string for each source, say s1/, s2/, ...
      Concatenate these strings in a pre-specified order and represent
      each character as its ASCII code producing s1/s2/.../.

   You then produce a sequence of random values derived from a strong
   mixing of these sources by calculating the MD5 hash [RFC 1321] of
   this string prefixed and suffixed with a zero byte for the first
   value, the string prefixed and suffixed by a 0x01 byte for the second
   value, etc.  Treat each of these derived random values as a positive
   multiprecision integer.  Then totally order the pool of listed
   volunteers as follows :If there are P volunteers, select the first by
   dividing the first derived random value by P and using the remainder
   plus one as the position of the selectee in the published list.
   Select the second by dividing the second derived random value by P-1
   and using the remainder plus one as the position in the list with the
   first selected person eliminated.  Etc.

   It is recommended that alphanumeric random sources be avoided due to
   the greater difficulty in canonicalizing them in an independently
   repeatable fashion; however, if any are used, all white space,
   punctuation, and special characters should be removed and all letters
   set to upper case. This will leave only an unbroken sequence of
   letters A-Z and digits 0-9 which can be treated as a canonicalized
   number above and suffixed with a "/".



5. Handling Problems

   In the real world, problems can arise in following the steps and flow
   outlined in Sections 2 through 4 above. Some problems that have
   actually arisen are described below with recommendations for handling
   them.



5.1 Uncertainty as to the Pool

   Every reasonable effort should be made to see that the published pool
   from which selection is made is of certain and eligible persons.
   However, especially with compressed schedules or perhaps someone
   whosee claim that they volunteered and are eligible has not been
   resolved by the deadline, or a determination that someone is not
   eligible which occurs after the publication of the pool, it may be
   that there are still uncertainties.

   The best way to handle this is to maintain the announced schedule,
   INCLUDE in the published pool all those whose eligibility is
   uncertain and to keep the published pool list IMMUTABLE after its
   publication. If someone in the pool is later selected by the


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 7]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Verifiable Random Selection              July 2001


   algorithm and random input but it has been determined they are
   ineligible, they must be skipped and the algorithm used further to
   make an additional selection. Thus the uncertainty only effects one
   selection and in general no more than a maximum of N selections where
   there are N uncertain pool members.

   Other courses of action are worse. Actual insertion or deletion of
   entries in the pool after its publication changes the length of the
   list and totally scrambles who is selected, possibly changing every
   selection. Insertion into the pool raises questions of where to
   insert: at the begining, end, alphbetic order, ... Any such choices
   by the selection administrator after the random numbers are known
   destroys the public verifiability of fair choice. Even if done before
   the random numbers are known, such dinking with the list after its
   publication just doesn't smell good.  There should be clear fixed
   publc deadlines and someone who challenges their absence from the
   pool after the published deadline should have their challenge
   automatically denied for tardiness.



5.2 Vacancies in Nomcom

   The ordering produced by the algorithm may needs to go used beyond
   the exact number to be select to allow for ineligibles, those who
   back out when actually contacted and asked to affirm their
   willingness to serve and maintain nomcom confidentiality, and those
   that can't be contacted.

   Yes, it has actually occurred that an eligible volunteer has been
   selected and found to be uncontactable, despite repeated good faith
   efforts over a period of weeks by email, telephone, and postal mail,
   including trying to go through their employer. There really isn't
   much choice in such as case other than to treat them as ineligible
   and go on to the next person selected. So, it might be a good idea in
   early announcements to make it clear that volunteers need to be
   contactable during, say, the week after the last random number is
   available. (In the past many enthusiastic volunteers have
   spontaneously told the selection administrator how to contact them if
   they were going to be on vacation, etc.)

   Vacancies occurring in the Nomcom after it has been established and
   is in operation are a little different.  It is generally recommended
   that the original ordering of the eligible pool be followed and the
   next volunteer contacted. Using new announced future random number
   inputs to select from the remainder to the pool is not recommended
   and may be impractical due to delays. Asking for a new pool of
   volunteers would be even worse and should be avoided except in the
   extraordinary case, unlikely to ever occur, where the eligible pool
   has been depleted. If the Nomcom is near to finishing its work, it


Donald E. Eastlake 3rd                                          [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Verifiable Random Selection              July 2001


   may not be worth filling a vacancy.



5.3 Randomness Ambiguities

   The best good faith efforts have been made to specify precise and
   unambiguous sources of randomness. These sources are made public in
   advance and there has not been objection to them. However, it has
   happened that when the time comes to actually get and use this
   randomness, the real world has thrown a curve ball and it isn't quite
   clear what data to use. Problems have particularly arisen in
   connection with stock prices and obscure financial exchange rates or
   indicies. When this happens, it is generally to late to announce new
   sources, an action which would raise suspicion of its own. About the
   only course of action is to make a reasonable choice within the
   ambiguity and depend on

   confidence in the good faith of the selection administrator.

   Based on these experience, it is again recommended that government
   run Lottery numbers or the like be used as the random inputs.

7. Security Considerations

   Careful choice of should be made of randomness inputs so that there
   is no reasonable suspicion that they are under the control of the
   administrator.  Guidelines given above to use a small number of
   inputs with a substantial amout of entropy from the last shoud be
   followed.  And equal care needs to be given that the algorithm
   selected is faithfully executed with the designated inputs values.
   Publication of the results and a week or so window for the community
   of interest to duplicate the calculations should give a reasonable
   assurance against implementation tampering.

   To maintain the unpredicatable character of selections, should a
   member of the nomcom need to be replaced due to death, resignation,
   expulsion, etc., new publicly announced future random sources should
   be used for the selection of their replacement.

Appendix A: History of NomCom Member Selection

   For reference purposes, here is a list of the IETF Nominations
   Committee

   member selection techniques and chairs so far:

           YEAR      CHAIR               SELECTION METHOD

        1993/1994  Jeff Case             Clergy
        1994/1995  Fred Baker            Clergy
        1995/1996  Guy Almes             Clergy
        1996/1997  Geoff Huston          Spouse
        1997/1998  Mike St.Johns         Algorithm
        1998/1999  Donald Eastlake 3rd   This Algorithm
        1999/2000  Avri Doria            This Alogrithm
        2000/2001  Bernard Aboba         This Algorithm

   Clergy = Names were written on pieces of paper, placed in a
   receptacle, and a member of the clergy picked the Nomcom members.

   Spouse = Same as Clergy except chair's spouse made the selection.

   Algorithm = Algorithmic selection based on the same concepts as
   documented herein.

   This Algorithm = Algorithmic selection using the algorithm and
   reference code described herein (but not the fake example sources of
   randomness).



Appendix B: Changes from RFC 2777

   This document differs from [RFC 2777], the previous version, in two
   primary ways as follows:

   (1) Section 5, on problems actually encountered with recommendations
       on how to handle them, has been added.

   (2) The selection algorithm and code have been recast from selection
       N entries from the pool to producing a total ordering of the
       pool. It is then easy to pick N by just taking the first N. This
       handles cases where some pool entries turn out to be ineligible,
       etc.

   Other minor changes and and updates were made.
