Abstract

    Graceful OSPF Restart as specified in RFC 3623 provides a mechanism 
    whereby an OSPF router can stay on the forwarding path even as its 
    OSPF software is restarted. This document provides an 
    implementation report for this extension to the base OSPF protocol.

Internet Draft  Graceful OSPF Restart Implementation Report     Feb 2004


1.  Overview

    Today many Internet routers implement a separation of control and
    forwarding functions. Certain processors are dedicated to control
    and management tasks such as OSPF routing, while other processors
    perform the data forwarding tasks. This separation creates the
    possibility of maintaining a router's data forwarding capability
    while the router's control software is restarted/reloaded. For the
    OSPF protocol [1], this protocol mechanisms necessary to accomplish
    this are described in Graceful OSPF Restart [GRACE]. 

    This document satisfies the RFC 1264 [CRITERIA] requirement for a 
    report on implementation experience for Graceful OSPF Restart. 
    Section 2 of this document contains the results of an 
    implementation survey.  It also documents implementation differences
    between the vendors responding to the survey. Section 3 contains a
    MIB reference. Sections 4 provide an authentication reference. 
    Section 5 simply refers to the implementations listed in section 2. 
    Section 6 includes a minimal set of test scenarios. Finally, 
    section 7 includes a disclaimer with respect to operational 
    experience.

2.  Implementation Experience 

    Six vendors have implemented graceful OSPF and have completed the 
    implementation survey. These include Redback, Juniper, Motorola 
    Comxputer Group (formerly Netplane Systems), Mahi Networks, 
    Nexthop technologies, and Force10 Networks. All have implemented 
    restart from the perspective of both a restarting and helper router.
    All but one vendor implemented both planned and unplanned restart. 
    All implementations are original. Four successfully tested 
    interoperability with Juniper. Juniper successfully tested 
    interoperability with Force10 Networks. One vendor hadn't 
    tested interoperability at the time of the survey.

2.1  Implementation Differences 

    The first difference was whether or not strict LSA checking was 
    implemented and, if so, whether it was configurable. In the context
    of graceful OSPF restart, strict LSA checking indicates whether or
    not a changed LSA will result in termination of graceful restart
    by a helping router. Two vendors made it configurable (one 
    defaulted it to disabled and the other disabled), another made it 
    a compile option (shipping with strict LSA checking disabled), 
    another didn't implement it at all, and two implemented strict 
    LSA checking with no configuration option to disable it. 

    The second was whether a received grace LSA would be taken to apply
    only to the adjacency on which it was received or all adjacencies
    with the restarting router. This is a rather subtle difference 
    since it only applies to helping and restarting routers with more 
    than one full adjacency at the time or restart. Five vendors 
    implemented the option of received grace LSA only applying to the 
    adjacency on which it was received.  One vendor applied the grace 
    LSA to all adjacencies with the grace LSA originator (i.e., the
    restarting router). 

    The final difference was in whether or not additional extensions
    were implemented to accommodate other features such as protocol 
    redistribution or interaction with MPLS VPNs [VPN]. Three vendors
    implemented extensions and three did not. It should be noted that
    such extensions are beyond the scope of Graceful OSPF 
    Restart [GRACE].

3. MIB Reference

   MIB objects for the Graceful OSPF Restart have been added to the 
   OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base [OSPFMIB]. Additions 
   include:

     - Objects ospfRestartSupport, ospfRestartInterval, ospfRestartAge,
       and ospfRestartExitReason to ospfGeneralGroup.
 
     - Objects ospfNbrRestartHelperStatus, ospfNbrRestartHelperAge, 
       and ospfNbrRestartHelperExitReason to ospfNbrEntry. 

     - Objects ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperStatus, 
       ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperAge, and 
       ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperExitReason to ospfVirtNbrEntry. 
 
4. Authentication Mechanisms 

   The authentication mechanisms are the same as those implemented
   by the base OSPF protocol [OSPF].

5. List of Implementations

   Refer to section 2. 

6. Test Scenarios 

   A router implementing graceful restart should test, at a minimum,
   the following scenarios as both a restarting and helping 
   router. For all scenarios, monitoring data plane traffic may be 
   used to assure the restart is non-disruptive: 

    1. Operation over a broadcast network. 
    2. Operation over a P2P network. 
    3. Operation over a virtual link.
    4. Operation using OSPF MD5 authentication. 
    5. Early graceful restart termination when an LSA consistency
       is detected. 
    6. Early graceful restart termination when a flooded LSA 
       changes (if implemented).

7. Operational Experience   

   Since the feature is configurable it is difficult to evaluate 
   operational experience at this juncture. However, service providers
   have tested and evaluated the feature.

8. Security Considerations

   This document does not address any security issues other a reference
   to the RFC 2328 [OSPF]. Security considerations for the OSPF protocol
   are included in RFC2328 [OSPF]. Security considerations for Graceful
   OSPF Restart are included in [GRACE].
