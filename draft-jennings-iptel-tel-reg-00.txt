   This document creates an Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA)
   registry for the tel Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) parameters,
   and their values.  It also lists the already existing parameters to
   be used as initial values for that registry.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registry for TEL URI Parameters      October 2005


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3966 [1] allows new tel URI parameters, and new parameter values
   to be defined.  However, RFC 3966 omitted an IANA registry for them.
   This specification creates such a registry.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].


3.  Use of the Registry

   The tel URI parameters and values for these parameters MUST be
   documented in a standards-track RFC in order to be registered by
   IANA.  This documentation MUST fully explain the syntax, intended
   usage, and semantics of the parameter.  The intent of this
   requirement is to assure interoperability between independent
   implementations, and to prevent accidental namespace collisions
   between implementations of dissimilar features.

   RFCs defining tel URI parameters, or parameter values MUST register
   them with IANA as described below.

   Registered tel URI parameters and their values are to be considered
   "reserved words".  In order to preserve interoperability, registered
   parameters MUST be used in a manner consistent with that described in
   their defining RFC.  Implementations MUST NOT utilize "private" or
   "locally defined" URI parameters that conflict with registered
   parameters.

   Some tel URI parameters only accept a set of predefined parameter
   values.  Registering all parameter values for all tel URI parameters
   of this type would require a large number of sub-registries.
   Instead, we have chosen to register URI parameter values by
   reference.  That is, the entry in the URI parameter registry for a
   given URI parameter contains references to the RFCs defining new
   values of that parameter.  References to RFCs defining parameter
   values appear in double brackets in the registry.

   So, the tel URI parameter registry contains a column that indicates
   whether or not each parameter only accepts a set of predefined
   values.  Implementers of parameters with a "yes" in that column need
   to find all the valid parameter values in the RFCs provided as
   references.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registry for TEL URI Parameters      October 2005


4.  IANA Considerations

   The specification creates a new IANA registry named "tel URI
   Parameters".

4.1.  tel URI Parameters Registry

   New tel URI parameters and new parameter values are registered by the
   IANA.  When registering a new tel parameter or a new value for a
   parameter, the following information MUST be provided.

   o  Name of the parameter.
   o  Whether the parameter only accepts a set of predefined values.
   o  Reference to the RFC defining the parameter and to any RFC that
      defines new values for the parameter.  References to RFCs defining
      parameter values appear in double brackets in the registry.

   Table 1 contains the initial values for this registry.



   Parameter Name     Predefined Values     Reference
   --------------     -----------------     ---------
   isub               Yes                   [RFC 3966]
   ext                Yes                   [RFC 3966]
   enumdi             No                    [RFC AAAA]
   rn                 Yes                   [RFC BBBB]
   rn-context         Yes                   [RFC BBBB]
   cic                Yes                   [RFC BBBB]
   cic-context        Yes                   [RFC BBBB]
   tgrp               Yes                   [RFC CCCC]
   trunk-context      Yes                   [RFC CCCC]

   Table 1: IANA tel URI parameter registry

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace AAAA with the RFC number for [6].
   Please replace BBBB with the RFC number for [5].  Please replace CCCC
   with the RFC number for [4].

4.2.  Registration Policy for tel URI Parameters

   As per the terminology in RFC 2434 [3], the registration policy for
   tel URI parameters shall be "Specification Required".

   For the purposes of this registry, the parameter for which IANA
   registration is requested MUST be defined by a standards-track RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   The registry in this document does not in itself have security
   considerations.  However, as mentioned in RFC 3427, an important
   reason for the IETF to manage the extensions of SIP is to ensure that
   all extensions and parameters are able to provide secure usage.  The
   supporting RFC publications for parameter registrations described
   this specification MUST provide detailed security considerations for
   them.
