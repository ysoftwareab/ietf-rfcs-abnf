Abstract

   This document describes a new LCAF for LISP, the Vendor Specific
   LCAF.  This LCAF enables organizations to have internal encodings for
   LCAF addresses.

1.  Introduction

   The LISP Canonical Address Format [RFC8060] defines the format and
   encoding for different address types that can be used on LISP
   [RFC6830] deployments.  However, certain deployments require specific
   format encodings that may not be applicable outside of the use-case
   for which they are defined.  The Vendor Specific LCAF allows
   organizations to create LCAF addresses to be used only internally on
   particular LISP deployments.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

3.  Vendor Specific LCAF

   The Vendor Specific LCAF relies on using the IEEE Organizationally
   Unique Identifier (OUI) [IEEE.802_2001] to prevent collisions across
   vendors or organizations using the LCAF.  The format of the Vendor
   Specific LCAF is provided below.

                           Vendor Specific LCAF

   The Vendor Specific LCAF has the following fields.

      Rsvd3: This 8-bit field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be
      set to 0 on transmit and MUST be ignored on receipt.

      Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI): This is a 24-bit field
      that carries the IEEE OUI [IEEE.802_2001] of the organization.

      Internal format: This is a variable length field that is left
      undefined on purpose.  Each vendor or organization can define its
      own internal format(s) to use with the Vendor Specific LCAF.

   The definition for the rest of the fields can be found in [RFC8060].

   The Vendor Specific LCAF type SHOULD not be used in deployments where
   different organizations interoperate.  If a LISP device receives a
   LISP message containing a Vendor Specific LCAF with an OUI that it
   does not understand, it SHOULD drop the message and a log action MUST
   be taken.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document enables organizations to define new LCAFs for their
   internal use.  It is the responsibility of these organizations to
   properly assess the security implications of the formats they define.

5.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Joel Halpern for his suggestions and
   comments regarding this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Following the guidelines of [RFC5226], this document requests IANA to
   update the "LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) Types" Registry
   defined in [RFC8060] to allocate the following assignment:

               +---------+---------------------+-----------+
               | Value # | LISP LCAF Type Name | Reference |
               +---------+---------------------+-----------+
               |   255   |   Vendor Specific   | Section 3 |
               +---------+---------------------+-----------+
