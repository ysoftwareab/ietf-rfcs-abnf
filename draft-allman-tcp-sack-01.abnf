pipe = HighData - HighACK - AmountSACKed ()

    (2) Set a ``RecoveryPoint'' variable to HighData.  When the TCP
        sender receives a cumulative ACK for this data octet the loss
        recovery phase is terminated.

    (3) The congestion window (cwnd) is reduced to half its current
        value.  The value of the slow start threshold (ssthresh) is set
        to the halved value of cwnd.

    (4) Retransmit the first data segment not covered by HighACK.  Use
        the MarkRetran () function to mark the sequence number range as
        having been retransmitted in the scoreboard.

    Once a TCP is in the loss recovery phase the following procedure
    MUST be used for each arriving ACK:

    (A) An incoming cumulative ACK for a sequence number greater than or
        equal to RecoveryPoint signals the end of loss recovery and the
        loss recovery phase MUST be terminated.

    (B) Upon receipt of a duplicate ACK the following actions MUST be
        taken:

        (B.1) Use Update () to record the new SACK information conveyed
            by the incoming ACK.
