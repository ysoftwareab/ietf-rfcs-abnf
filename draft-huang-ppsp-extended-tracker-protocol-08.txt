                PPSP Tracker Protocol-Extended Protocol
             draft-huang-ppsp-extended-tracker-protocol-08


Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the PPSP Tracker Protocol -
   Base Protocol, which complements the core messages of the protocol
   with Request-Response enhancements  and usages, and with a new
   DISCONNECT Protocol-level message.  These enhancements and usages are
   related with the exchange of meta information between trackers and
   peers, such as initial offer/request of participation in multimedia
   content streaming, content information, peer lists, reports of
   activity and status, and graceful disconnection from the network. 
   The extension is retro-compatible with the PPSP-TP Base Protocol.

INTERNET DRAFT                PPSP-TP/1.1                  March 9, 2015


1.  Introduction

   The PPSP Tracker Protocol is one of the Peer-to-Peer Streaming
   Protocol which specifies standard format/encoding of information and
   messages between PPSP peers and PPSP trackers.  Based on the
   requirements defined in RFC 6972 [RFC6972], the base tracker protocol
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol] has provided the
   basic core messages to be exchanged between trackers and peers in
   order to carry out some fundamental operations.  The core messages
   are mandatory, covering most basic and universal use cases, and MUST
   be implemented in all PPSP-based streaming systems.

   This document specifies extensions to the base core messages of
   [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol] with enhancements in
   request/responses and new optional request message, providing new
   usages in some scenarios.  The extension of the base protocol is
   retro-compatible with the PPSP-TP Base Protocol, and messages using
   this specification MUST be safely rejected by trackers not supporting
   the extensions to avoid affecting interoperability.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This draft uses terms defined in [RFC6972] and [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-
   tracker-protocol].

3.  Motivation

   There are a number of possible usages and issues which may be useful
   for discussion and which the base tracker protocol may not be able to
   deal with.

   1. In the base tracker protocol, the disconnection between peer and
      tracker is achieved by a timeout (of periodic STAT_REPORT
      messages) which means that trackers lack the ability to timely
      free up resources.  In some cases when the number of connected
      peers is reaching the maximum capacity of a tracker, resources of
      the tracker cannot be released immediately even if some peers
      leave the swarm, hence resulting in connection failures. This
      requires the base tracker protocol to be extended to have a
      message providing the ability to notify the tracker that a peer
      has left. 
   2. A peer may have the requirement to start streaming the content
      from one specific point of the content timeline.  For example,
      when the end-user watches only part of a content and decides to

INTERNET DRAFT                PPSP-TP/1.1                  March 9, 2015


      stop and leave, or pauses for a long time.  When the end-user
      wants to resume the session he/she expects to continue watching
      the content from the point where he/she interrupted.  The peer may
      then request the tracker to select a subset of peers capable to
      provide that specific content scope.  In this case, it requires
      that the quest for content from neighbor peers should contain the
      content scope information and peers should constantly report their
      content scope information to the tracker.   

4.  Extended Tracker Protocol Overview

   The extended Tracker Protocol consists of two Request-Response
   Extensions (to the FIND and STAT_REPORT Request messages of the Base
   Protocol) and one Protocol-level Extension (a new DISCONNECT Request
   message).

4.1. Request-Response Extension

   In this section, the FIND and STAT_REPORT messages specified in the
   base tracker protocol are extended to meet the needs of use case 2
   listed in section 3.

   FIND:  The enhanced FIND Request message allows a peer to request the
          tracker for a subset of peers in a swarm but including
          specific content scopes, either media content representations
          or specific chunks/segments of a media representation in a
          swarm, and may also include an updated network address of the
          peer.  On receiving a FIND message, the tracker selects a
          subset of peers satisfying the requesting scope.  To create
          the peer list, the tracker may also take peer status,
          capabilities and peers priority into consideration.  Peer
          priority may be determined by network topology preference,
          operator policy preference, etc.  The format and detailed
          processing of enhanced CONNECT Request message is presented in
          Section 5.2.

   STAT_REPORT:  The enhanced STAT_REPORT Request message allows the
          exchanges of content data information, like chunkmaps, between
          an active peer and a tracker.  The information can be used by
          a tracker as a qualification to select appropriate subsets of
          peers in the swarm satisfying specific scopes (in terms of
          content).  The format and detailed processing of enhanced
          CONNECT Request message is presented in Section 5.3.

   To present the content data information, the chunk addressing schemes
   (section 4 of [I-D.ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol]) are used to support
   different ways of identifying chunks and expressing chunk
   availability of a peer in a compact fashion.  The chunk addressing

INTERNET DRAFT                PPSP-TP/1.1                  March 9, 2015


   methods for certain content should be recorded in the metadata of the
   swarm for the content, and they can be obtained by peers or trackers
   during the enrollment and bootstrap stage.

4.2. Protocol-level Extension

   A new Request message is introduced in this section to extend those
   specified in the base tracker protocol [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-
   protocol], to meet the needs of issue 1 listed in section 3.

   DISCONNECT:  The DISCONNECT Request message is used when the peer
          intends to no longer participate in all swarms.  When
          receiving the DISCONNECT Request message from a peer, the
          tracker deletes the corresponding activity records related to
          the peer (including its status and all content status for the
          corresponding swarms).  In such a case, the DISCONNECT Request
          message will have the same effect of timer expiring
          (STAT_REPORT), but providing a graceful disconnection of that
          peer from the system.

4.3. Usage of Extended Request Messages

   An example of usage of the extended request messages is illustrated
   in Figure 1.  In that figure a peer starts by connecting to the
   system and joining a specific swarm (swarm_a) in SEED mode (step_1).
   

   While active, the peer periodically updates the tracker using
   STAT_REPORT messages.  Later, the peer CONNECTs to another swarm
   (swarm_b) but in LEECH mode, i.e., the end-user intends to watch that
   new content while still sharing the first one (step_2).  During the
   streaming session the peer requests an updated list of peers in that
   new swarm to the tracker (step_3). When the end-user wants to leave
   the second content, not having even finished watching, the peer sends
   a CONNECT message with a "leave" action (step_4) for the
   corresponding swarm (swarm_b) but remains sharing the first content
   (swarm_a).

   But later, the end user wants to continue watching the content he/she
   previously left unfinished. So the peer firstly CONNECTs to the
   corresponding swarm in LEECH mode, then sends FIND message with the
   specific content information scope (step_5). Tracker will find the
   group of peers who has the specific content for this peer.

   Finally,the peer wants to quit the system completely. It does not
   have to send a CONNECT message with a "leave" action one by one. It
   just sends the DISCONNECT message to the tracker (step_6), then
   tracker will remove all the information for this peer.

4.4. Extended Tracker Transaction State Machine

   The tracker state machine introduced in the base tracker protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol] is now updated in this
   specification to reflect the extensions introduced.  An updated "per-
   Peer-ID" transaction state machine (Figure 2) is described,
   corresponding to the enhanced functionalities and control steps of
   the extended tracker protocol. This extended "per-Peer-ID"

   together with the causing events and resulting actions when
   implementing the extensions to the base tracker protocol.  Note that
   Specific error conditions are not shown in the state diagram.

   step 5 as follow:

   5) While TRACKING, a DISCONNECT message received from the peer, or a
      CONNECT message with the action to leave the last swarm, the
      tracker stops the "track timer", cleans the information associated
      with the participation of the Peer-ID in the the swarm(s) joined,
      responds with a successful condition, deletes the registration of
      the Peer-ID and transitions to TERMINATED state for that Peer-ID.

4.4.2. Error Conditions

      Error condition steps are the same with section 2.3.2 of the base
      tracker protocol [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol] except the
      2nd paragraph of step A:

   A) At PEER REGISTERED state, if the Peer ID is considered invalid (in
      the case of a  CONNECT request, or FIND request, or STAT_REPORT
      request, or DISCONNECT request received from an unregistered Peer
      ID), the tracker responds with either error codes authentication
      required or Forbidden (described in section 4.3 of the base
      tracker protocol), transitions to TERMINATE state for that Peer ID
      and that state machine instance is destroyed. 

5  Extended Tracker Protocol Specification

5.1. Request/Response Syntax and Format

   The architecture specified in the base tracker protocol [I-D.ietf-
   ppsp-base-tracker-protocol] does not suffers any modification in the
   extended protocol.  The syntax is identical with some elements
   extended to contain new optional attributes:

   The request type includes CONNECT, FIND, STAT_REPORT and DISCONNECT,
   including a "content" element to the FIND method, that MAY be present
   in requests referencing content, i.e., FIND and STAT_REPORT, if the
   request includes a content scope.

   The extended semantics of the request therefore is described as
   follows.

      ppsp_tp_string_t ppsp_tp_request_type_t =   "CONNECT"
                                                | "FIND"
                                                | "STAT_REPORT"
                                                | "DISCONNECT";

      Object {
                 ppsp_tp_version_t        version;
                 ppsp_tp_request_type_t   request_type;

                 ppsp_tp_string_t         transaction_id;
                 ppsp_tp_string_t         peer_id;
                 [JSONValue request_data = ppsp_tp_req_connect  connect 
                                         | ppsp_tp_req_find     find
                                         | ppsp_tp_stat_group_t stat_report;]
      } ppsp_tp_request;

   Note that only when request_type of ppsp_tp_request is "DISCONNECT",
   request_data is allowed to be omitted.

   The extended value for ppsp_tp_version_t is listed in Table 1 as
   follow:

      +----------------------------------------------------------+
      | ppsp_tp_version_t |  Description                         |
      +----------------------------------------------------------+
      | 0                 |  Reserved                            |
      | 1                 |  PPSP base tracker protocol          |
      | 2                 |  PPSP extended tracker protocol      | 
      |                   |  (specified in this document )       |
      | 3-255             |  Unassigned                          |
      +----------------------------------------------------------+

        Table 1:  Extended PPSP Tracker Protocol Version Numbers

   The semantics for the content information element is described as
   follow:

      Object {
                 ppsp_tp_integer_t   start_index;
                 ppsp_tp_integer_t   end_index; // 0 means no end
      }ppsp_tp_segment_info_t;

      Object {
                 ppsp_tp_integer_t         chunk_addressing_method;
                 ppsp_tp_segment_info_t    segments<1..*>;     
      }ppsp_tp_content_info_t;

   The semantics of ppsp_tp_request_find is extend as follows:

      Object {
                  ppsp_tp_string_t         swarm_id;
                 [ppsp_tp_peer_num_t       peer_num;]
                 [ppsp_tp_segment_info_t   content_info;]
      } ppsp_tp_request_find;

INTERNET DRAFT                PPSP-TP/1.1                  March 9, 2015


   The semantics of stream_stats is extended as follows:

      Object {
                 ppsp_tp_swarm_id_t      swarm_id;
                 ppsp_tp_integer_t       uploaded_bytes;
                 ppsp_tp_integer_t       downloaded_bytes;
                 ppsp_tp_integer_t       available_bandwidth;
                 ppsp_tp_content_info_t  content_info;       
      }stream_stats; 

   Currently, the value of chunk_addressing_method is identical to the
   addressing method listed in section 7.8 of [I-D.ietf-ppsp-peer-
   protocol], as follow:

                    +--------+---------------------+
                    | Method | Description         |
                    +--------+---------------------+
                    | 0      | 32-bit bins         |
                    | 1      | 64-bit byte ranges  |
                    | 2      | 32-bit chunk ranges |
                    | 3      | 64-bit bins         |
                    | 4      | 64-bit chunk ranges |
                    | 5-255  | Unassigned          |
                    +--------+---------------------+

                   Table 1: Chunk Addressing Methods

   Implementations MUST support "32-bit chunk ranges" (default) and "64-
   bit chunk ranges".  When the chunk_addressing_method is 32-bit bins
   or 64-bit bins, end_index in SegmentInfo MUST be set to 0.  Chunk
   addressing methods could be extended to allow new algorithms in
   future specifications, e.g., [BFbitmap].  This document does not
   extends the semantics and format of Responses.

5.3. Compatibility with the Base Tracker Protocol

   Trackers are RECOMMENDED to implement extended tracker protocol to be
   compatible with peers using base tracker protocol or peers using
   extended tracker protocol.  But it is not mandatory. When peers have
   different implementations with trackers, following 2 catalogs are
   given:

   1. Peer (with extended protocol) vs Tracker (with base protocol)

   When peers using extended tracker protocol exchange content
   information with a tracker only supporting the base tracker protocol,
   the tracker would respond with 401 (Unsupported version number)
   error_code with an empty message-body (no peer_addr and swarm_result

   attributes), which indicates the messages could not be recognized by
   the tracker. In this case, peers MUST stop interacting with the
   tracker in extended request messages and use the base tracker
   protocol instead.

   2. Peer (with base protocol) vs Tracker (with extended protocol)

   The tracker is able to handle all the requests from the peer because
   all the messages are base tracker protocol messages which could be
   perfectly accepted by a tracker implementing extended tracker
   protocol.

5.4. Negotiation of Chunk Addressing Methods

   Multiple chunk addressing methods could be used in this document to
   present content information.  But only one of them MUST be used for
   one swarm when a peer communicating with a tracker.  Before peers
   connect to a tracker, they MUST get to know the chunk addressing
   methods supported by the swarm.  It is out of scope of the tracker
   protocol the mechanism used to obtain that information.  For example,
   it could be some out-of-band methods that obtains that information
   from the web portal, together with other information about the
   trackers, e.g., IP addresses. 

   If the chunk addressing method of a swarm can not be supported by a
   tracker, the tracker is not suggested to serve that swarm.  If the
   chunk addressing method contained in requests is not supported by the
   swarm controlled by the tracker, the tracker could directly ignore
   the content related information.

5.5. Request/Response Processing

5.5.1. Enhanced FIND Request

   This method allows peers to request to the tracker, whenever needed,
   a new peer list for the swarm for specific scope of chunks/segments
   of a media content representation of that swarm.

   The peer MUST properly set the request type to FIND, set the PeerID
   with the identifier of the peer, and set the SwarmID with the
   identifier of the swarm the peer is interested in.  Optionally, in
   order to find peers having the specific chunks/segments, the peer may
   include the ContentGroup element in the FIND request message to
   indicate a specific point in the content timeline.

   This message is mainly used for peers in LEECH mode in order to
   update the peer list of a swarm.  For those requests whose peer_mode
   are not set to LEECH, the tracker must respond with 400 (Bad request,
   with reason-phrase "Unknown Messages").

   In the case of a FIND with a specific scope of a stream content the
   request SHOULD include a ContentGroup to specify the segment range of
   content Representations.

   The response MAY also include a PeerGroup with PeerInfo data that
   includes the requesting peer public IP address.  

5.5.2. Enhanced STAT_REPORT Request

   This message still uses the specifications of the base tracker
   protocol [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol].  The Stat element has
   been extended with one property, "content_info", to allow peers
   reporting map of chunks they have.  The tracker would not have the
   ability to treat the FIND requests for specific content chunks,
   unless peers report this kind of information.  The corresponding
   Response does not need to be extended in this specification.

5.5.3. DISCONNECT Request

   This method is used when the peer intends to leave the system and no
   longer participate.  The tracker SHOULD delete the corresponding
   activity records related with the peer in all the swarms (including
   its status and all content status).

   The peer MUST properly form the Request message, set the request type
   to DISCONNECT, set the PeerID with the identifier of the peer, and
   randomly generate and set the TransactionID.

6. Error and Recovery Conditions

   This document does not introduces any new error and recovery
   conditions.  The implementation of error treatment MUST refer to the
   base tracker protocol specification [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-
   protocol].

7. Security Considerations

   The extended tracker protocol proposed in this document introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in the base
   tracker protocol specification [I-D.ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol].

8. IANA Considerations

   This draft introduces a new version number, see Table 1. Thus
   corresponding IANA registration is required.
