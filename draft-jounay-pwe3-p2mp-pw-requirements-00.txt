1. Introduction 
   
1.1. Problem Statement 
   
  As defined in the PWE3 WG charter, a Pseudowire (PW) emulates a 
  point-to-point bidirectional link over an IP/MPLS network, and 
  provides a single service which is perceived by its user as an 
  unshared link or circuit of the chosen service. A Pseudowire is used 
  to transport non IP traffics (e.g. Ethernet, TDM, ATM, and FR) in a 
  MPLS-based PSN (Packet Switched Network). PWE3 operates "edge to 
  edge" to provide the required connectivity between the two endpoints 
  of the PW. 

  For some use cases described hereafter, some P2MP services require 
  the use of Pseudowire for their encapsulation capabilities. This 
  could be achieved using a set of point to point PWs, with traffic 
  replication on the Ingress PE, but faces obvious bandwidth limitation 
  issues, as traffic is carried multiple time on shared links. To avoid 
  such bandwidth wastings, an alternative solution consists of using a 
  unique Point to Multipoint PW (P2MP PW) that is a unidirectional PW 
  with one Ingress PE and a set of one or more Egress PEs, and without 
  traffic replication on Ingress PE. 

  This document aims at describing possible use cases for P2MP PW and 
  defining the associated requirements related to the P2MP PW setup and 
  maintenance. 
  It is intended that solutions that specify procedures and protocols 
  or extensions to existing protocols for the signaling of P2MP 
  Pseudowire satisfy these requirements. 
   
1.2. Scope of the document 
   
  The first part of the document aims at listing a set of use cases 
  which would take benefits of the use of a unidirectional P2MP 
  Pseudowire rather than multiple point to point Pseudowires.  
   
  The second part describes the specific signaling requirements for the 
  set up and maintenance of a P2MP PW. The requirements are divided 
  into two parts, i.e. those applicable in a Single-Segment topology 
  and those applicable in a Multi-Segment topology. For other aspects 
  of P2MP PW implementation like packet processing, maintenance, etc, 
  the document refers to [RFC3916].  
   
  Some P2MP PW requirements are derived from the signaling requirements 
  for P2MP Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths [RFC4461].

2.2. Terminology 
   
  This document uses terminology described in [MS-PW REQ], [MS-PW 
  ARCH], [SEG PW]. 
   
  It also introduces additional terms needed in the context of 
  unidirectional P2MP PW. 
   
  P2MP PW, (also referred as PW Tree) 
   
  Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire. A PW attached to a source used to 
  distribute L1/L2 format traffic to a set of one or more receivers (or 
  leaves). The P2MP PW is unidirectional. 
   
  P2MP SS-PW 
   
  Point-to-Multipoint Single-Segment Pseudowire. A single segment P2MP 
  PW set up between the PE attached to the source and the PEs attached 
  to the receivers. The P2MP SS-PW relies on a P2MP LSP as PSN tunnel. 
   
  P2MP MS-PW 
   
  Point-to-Multipoint Multi-Segment Pseudowire. A multi-segment P2MP PW 
  represents an End-to-End PW segmented by means of S-PEs which are in 
  charge of switching the PW label. Each segment can rely on either  
  P2P LSP or a P2MP LSP as PSN tunnel.  
     
  Ingress PE 
   
  P2MP PW Ingress Provider Edge. Router attached to a Customer 
  Equipment (traffic source) via an Attachment Circuit (AC). In a MS-PW 
  architecture the term used is Ingress T-PE. 
   
  Egress PE 
   
  P2MP PW Egress Provider Edge. Router attached to a set of on or more 
  Customer Equipments (traffic receivers or leaves) via a set of one or

  more Attachment Circuits (AC). In a MS-PW architecture the term used 
  is Egress T-PE. 
   
  Branch S-PE 
   
  The branch S-PE is only defined and required in the context of MS-PW. 
  The branch S-PE has one upstream PW segment and one or several 
  downstream PW segments. 
   
   
3. Use Cases for P2MP PW 
   
3.1. TDM-based Use Case 
   
  In a PSN environment, PWs allow supporting 2G/3G mobile backhauling 
  (e.g. TDM traffic for GSM's Abis interface, ATM traffic for Release 
  99 UMTS's Iub interface). At the time being, the Mobile backhauling 
  architecture is always built as a star topology between the 2G/3G 
  controller (e.g. BSC or RNC) and the 2G/3G Base Stations (BTS or 
  NodeB). Therefore P2P PWs are used between each Base Station and 
  their corresponding controller and nothing more is required. 
   
  As far as synchronization in a PSN environment is concerned, 
  different mechanisms can be considered to provide frequency and phase 
  clock required in the 2G/3G Mobile environment to guarantee mobile 
  handover and strict QoS. One of them consists in using Adaptive Clock 
  Distribution and Recovery. With this method a Master element 
  distributes a reference clock at protocol level by regularly sending 
  TDM PW packets (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP) to Slave elements. This 
  process is based on the fact that the volume of transmitted data 
  arrival is considered as an indication of the source frequency that 
  could be used by the Slave element to recover the source clock 
  frequency. Consequently, with the current methods, the PE connected 
  to the Master must setup and maintain as many P2P PWs as we have 
  Slave elements, and it has to replicate the traffic. A better 
  solution to deliver the clock frequency would be to use a P2MP PW. 
  This may scale much more than P2P PWs with regards to the forwarding 
  plane at the Ingress PE since the traffic coming from the Master is 
  no more replicated to the P2P PWs but only to the outgoing interface 
  corresponding to the P2MP PW. It may ease the provisioning process 
  since only one PW source endpoint must be configured at the Ingress 
  PE. This alleviated provisioning process would be particularly 
  appreciated for the introduction of new Base Stations. The main gain 
  would be to avoid replication on the Ingress PE and hence save 
  bandwidth consumed by the synchronization traffic which typically 
  requires the highest level of QoS. This kind of traffic will be 
  competing with equivalent QOS traffic like VoIP, that is why it is 
  significant to save the slightest bandwidth.

3.2. ATM-based Use Case 
   
  A use case of ATM-based P2MP PW could be to offer the capability for 
  service providers to support IP multicast wholesale services over ATM 
  in case the wholesale customer relies on ATM infrastructure. The PW 
  P2MP alleviates the constraint in terms of replication for ATM to 
  support IP multicast services. Today most video distribution networks 
  require point-to-multipoint as well as point-to-point transport for 
  live broadcasting and non-live contents distribution.  As for point-
  to-multipoint traffic, there are some traditional approaches to 
  convey it, for example, by ATM based duplication (point-to-multipoint 
  PVP/PVCs). Terminal CE devices in such environment support legacy 
  protocol interfaces only as such. However, the trend to migrate such 
  an old network onto MPLS/IP-based backbone is still growing now.  
  Hence it is expected that a standard Pseudo Wire setup/encapsulation 
  method will support point-to-multipoint transport of various kinds of 
  conventional protocols. 
                                
3.3. Ethernet-based Use Case 
   
3.3.1. P2MP PW for VPLS 
   
  The requirements for Multicast Support in VPLS is described in [VPLS 
  MCAST REQ]. P2MP Pseudo wire might be able to be applied as an 
  efficient PW forwarding mechanism for multicast VPLS.   
   
3.3.2. P2MP PW for Ethernet-based VPWS 
   
  VPLS supports only Ethernet service.  If you need other protocols be 
  natively transported in point-to-multipoint way, P2MP PW would be a 
  candidate alternative. 
   
  VPLS natively requires MAC-based learning and forwarding, however 
  video distribution applications generally use a single tree like 
  network topology, and do not require the added expense of MAC 
  learning.  
   
  VPLS natively connects multiple all CEs as default, but for some 
  applications that provide just point-to-multipoint type transport, 
  traffic from receiver to sender is not needed, and traffic between 
  different receivers directly are not needed, either.  In this case, 
  P2MP PWS provides much simpler operation to it. 
   
  Note that P2MP PW has a limitation in the point of its uni-
  directional service model.  If the application layer needs bi-
  directional communication at CE, some additional techniques may be 
  necessary to support. 
   
  As mentioned above the use case related to Ethernet-based P2MP PW is 
  particularly focused on VPWS which does not require features hold by 
  the VSI (MAC learning, MAC forwarding) or auto-discovery procedures 
  in VPLS.

  The P2MP VPWS is typically a service required when a service provider 
  wants to deliver in a cross-connect mode traffic from one endpoint to 
  several endpoints. 
   
4. P2MP SS-PW Requirements 
   
4.1. P2MP SS-PW Reference Model 
   
  Note: the P2MP SS-PW reference model presented in this document 
  refers to the one defined in [PW MCAST]. The format differs only to 
  get a common model for the P2MP SS-PW and P2MP MS-PW. 
   
  A unidirectional P2MP SS-PW provides a Point-to-Multipoint 
  connectivity from an Ingress PE connected to a traffic source to at 
  least two Egress PEs connected to traffic receivers. The PW endpoints 
  connect the PW to its attachment circuits (AC). As for a P2P PW, an 
  AC can be a Frame Relay DLCI, an ATM VPI/VC, an Ethernet port, a 
  VLAN, a HDLC link, a PPP connection on a physical interface.  
   
  Figure 1 describes the P2MP SS-PW reference model which is derived 
  from [RFC3985] to support P2MP emulated services.

  between edge nodes of a single PSN domain to transport a 
  unidirectional P2MP PW with endpoints at these edge nodes.

  In this model a single copy of each PW packet is sent over the P2MP 
  PSN tunnel and is received by all Egress PEs due to the P2MP nature 
  of the PSN tunnel. 
   
4.2. P2MP SS-PW Underlying Layer 
   
  The P2MP SS-PW implies an underlying P2MP PSN tunnel. Figure 2 gives 
  an example of P2MP SS-PW topology relying on a P2MP LSP. The PW tree 
  is composed of one Ingress PE (i1) and several Egress PEs (e1, e2, 
  e3, e4).   
   
  Depending on the Traffic-Engineering requirements, the P2MP PSN will 
  be signaled with P2MP RSVP-TE [P2MP RSVP-TE] or MLDP [MLDP].

  As described in 4.3.1 the PW label MUST be upstream assigned by the 
  Ingress PE. When the Egress PE receives the upstream label, it MUST 
  learn in meantime the associated context, i.e. the P2MP LSP on which 
  the P2MP PW is setup. When the traffic is received at the Egress PE, 
  the Egress PE MUST check the PW label but also the LSP label to 
  determine the L2VPN to which the packet belongs to. To achieve the 
  PHP (Penultimate Hop Popping) must be deactivated on the P2MP LSP. 
   
4.3. P2MP SS-PW Signaling Requirements 
   
4.3.1. P2MP SS-PW Setup Mechanisms 
   
  The PW setup could be either leaf initiated or source initiated. Some 
  P2MP application may request a dynamic tree setup with efficient 
  provisioning procedure. In that case a source-initiated mode SHOULD 
  be selected.  
   
  Due to the underlying P2MP PSN tunnel, the PW label MUST be upstream 
  assigned by the Ingress PE.   
   
4.3.2. Leaf Grafting/Pruning 
   
  Once the PW tree is setup, the solution MUST allow the addition or 
  removal of a leaf, or a subset of leaves to/from the existing tree,

  without any impact on the PW tree (data and control planes) for the 
  remaining leaves.  
   
  Such PW Tree leaf grafting/pruning could be source or leaf-initiated. 
   
4.4. Failure Reporting and Processing 
   
  Since the underlying layer has an End-to-End P2MP topology between 
  the Ingress PE and the Egress PEs, the failure reporting and 
  processing procedures are implemented only on the edge nodes. 
   
  Failure events may cause one or more Egress PEs and associated leaves 
  to become detached from the PW tree. These events MUST be reported to 
  the Ingress PE, using appropriate in-band or out-band OAM messages.  
  The solution SHOULD allow the Ingress PE to be informed of Egress PEs 
  and associated leaves failure for management purposes. 
   
  Based on these failure notifications the solution must allow the 
  Ingress PE to update the remaining leaves of the PW tree. 
   
  - A solution MUST support in-band OAM mechanism to detect failures: 
  unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic failure. 
   
  - In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which leaf PEs are 
  affected. It SHOULD be realized by enhancing existing unicast PW 
  methods, such as VCCV for seamless and familiar operation. 
   
  - A solution MAY support OAM message mapping at PE if failure happens 
  i.e., mapping AC service OAM between P2MP PW OAM. (This needs more 
  discussion) 
   
  In addition it is assumed that if recovery procedures are required 
  the P2MP LSP will support the classic recovery techniques mainly 
  based on RSVP-TE. A mechanism should be implemented to avoid race 
  conditions between recovery at the PSN level and recovery at the PW 
  level. 
   
   
4.5. Advertisement of P2MP Capability 
   
  The solution should be completely backward compatible with  
  the current PW standards. The solution should take into account the 
  capability advertisement and negotiation procedures for the PEs 
  implementing P2MP SS-PW endpoints. 
   
  Implementation of OAM mechanisms also implies the advertisement of PE 
  capabilities to support specific OAM features. The solution SHOULD 
  allow advertising P2MP PW OAM capabilities.    
   
4.6. Scalability

  The solution should scale at least as well as linearly with an 
  increase in the number of Egress PEs.  
   
  The solution SHOULD provide a simple provisioning procedure to build 
  a P2MP SS-PW. This is related to manageability not scalability.

  Figure 3 extends the P2MP SS-PW architecture of Figure 1 to a multi-
  segment configuration. In a P2P MS-PW configuration as described in 
  [MS-PW REQ] the S-PE is responsible to switch a MS-PW from one input 
  segment to only one output segment, based on the PW identifier. Here 
  in a P2MP MS-PW configuration the S-PE is responsible to switch a MS-
  PW from one input segment to one or several output segments. 
    
  Referring to Figure 3 T-PE1 is the Ingress T-PE and T-PE2, T-PE3, T-
  PE4 and T-PE5 are the Egress T-PEs. In the reference model, the 
  Egress T-PEs are assumed to be located in the same PSN (PSN2), but it 
  could be envisioned that each output PW is located in a different PSN 
  (PSN2, PSN3, PSN4). The S-PE plays the role of branch S-PE since it 
  is in charge of switching simultaneously the input PW1 segment to the 
  output PW2, PW3, PW4 segments.  
   
  Note that a P2MP MS-PW may obviously transit through more than one S-
  PE along its path. 
   
  Note that if the P2MP SS-PW case mandatory implies the use of P2MP 
  PSN tunnel (underlying layer) between the edge nodes, the P2MP MS-PW 
  does not imply such a requirement since each PW segment can be 
  supported over a P2P PSN tunnel. However as we will see hereafter, 
  the coexistence of both kind of PSN tunnel (P2P and P2MP) MUST be 
  considered, as described in Figure 3 where the P2MP PW3 segment is 
  supported over P2MP LSP. 
   
5.2. P2MP MS-PW Underlying Layer 
   
  Figure 4 describes an example of P2MP MS-PW topology relying on a 
  combination of both P2P and P2MP LSPs as PSN tunnels. The PW tree is 
  composed of one Ingress PE (i1) and several Egress PEs (e1, e2, e3, 
  e4). The branch S-PEs are represented as b1, b2, b3, b4, b5. In that 
  case the traffic replication along the path of the PW tree is 
  performed at the PW level. For instance the branch S-PE b5 MUST 
  replicate incoming packets or data received from b2 and send them to 
  Egress T-PEs e3 and e4. 
   
  However giving the fact that some PW segments may be supported over a 
  P2MP LSP, the traffic replication along the path of these PW segments 
  can be performed as well at the underlying LSP level. 
   
  Figure 4 describes the case where each segment is supported over a 
  P2P LSP except for the b1-b3 and b1-b4 segments which are conveyed 
  over a P2MP LSP on this section.

  Depending on the Traffic-Engineering requirements, the P2MP PSN may 
  be signaled with P2MP RSVP-TE [P2MP-RSVP-TE or MLDP [MLDP]. 
   
  As for the P2MP SS-PW and for the same purpose the PHP (Penultimate 
  Hop Popping) must be deactivated on the P2MP LSP as described in 4.2. 
   
5.3. P2MP MS-PW Signaling Requirements 
   
5.3.1. PW Addresses Routing 
   
  The PW tree could be statically configured at the T-PEs and each S-PE 
  crossed. However it is RECOMMENDED to derive benefit from the use of 
  PW addresses routing procedures (AII addressing used as reachability 
  information) in order to allow dynamic PW tree setup based on 
  principles described in [DYN MS-PW]. 
   
5.3.2. P2MP MS-PW Setup Mechanisms 
   
  The requirements described in this section assume that a PW  
  addresses routing dissemination procedure allows to dynamically 
  update each T-PE and S-PE PW addresses routing table. 
   
  The P2MP MS-PW setup could be source or leaf-initiated. However it is 
  RECOMMENDED that the solution provides various optimization options 
  in the P2MP MS-PW construction (Traffic-Engineered P2MP MS-PW).  
   
  Since a PW segment belonging to the P2MP MS-PW MAY be supported over 
  a P2P LSP, the PW upstream label assignment mode is no longer 
  mandatory. However it is RECOMMENDED to use this mode to be able to 
  deal with configuration where P2MP LSP supports several PW segments. 
   
   
5.3.3. Leaf Grafting/Pruning 
   
  Once the PW tree is setup, the solution MUST allow the addition or 
  removal of a leaf, or a subset of leaves to/from the existing tree, 
  without any impact on the PW tree (data and control planes) for the 
  remaining leaves.

5.3.4. Explicit Routing 
   
  The P2MP MS-PW signaling solution MUST provide a means of 
  establishing arbitrary P2MP MS-PW, according to pre-computed and 
  configured S-PE paths as well as dynamically computed S-PE paths on 
  the Ingress PE.   
     
  To support setup of explicitly routed MS-PW tree, the signaling 
  solution SHOULD support some source-based control that can explicitly 
  define particular S-PE nodes as branch S-PEs for the PW tree. 
   
  The solution SHOULD let possible Explicit Path Loose Hops (to be 
  defined). Therefore the P2MP MS-PW MAY be partially specified with 
  only a subset of intermediate branch S-PEs. 
   
5.4. Failure Reporting 
   
  The solution SHOULD rely on specific OAM mechanisms to detect a node 
  (T-PE and S-PE) or segment failure of a PW tree. The solution SHOULD 
  also support the ability to inform the Ingress T-PE of the failure as 
  well as to indicate the identity of affected Egress T-PEs and 
  associated leaves. 
   
  Based on these failure notifications the solution MUST allow the 
  Ingress T-PE to update the remaining Egress PEs and associated leaves 
  of the PW tree. 
   
  During the PW tree setup, a branch S-PE SHOULD be capable to inform 
  the upstream PEs, including the Ingress T-PE that a set of Egress T-
  PEs and associated leaves are not reachable in accordance with the 
  local PW addresses routing table.  
   
  - A solution MUST support in-band OAM mechanism to detect failures: 
  unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic failure. 
   
  - In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which leaf T-PEs and 
  branch S-PEs are affected. It SHOULD be realized by enhancing 
  existing unicast PW methods, such as VCCV for seamless and familiar 
  operation. 
   
  - A solution MAY support OAM message mapping at T-PE if failure 
  happens i.e., mapping AC service OAM between P2MP PW OAM. (This needs 
  more discussion) 
   
5.5. Protection and Restoration 
   
  The solution SHOULD provide mechanisms to recover as fast as possible 
  following a failure event. The fast protection/recovery is typically 
  dedicated to P2MP applications sensitive to traffic disruption.

  Considering (i) a source-initiated PW tree setup and (ii) that a 
  local repair (PSN-tunnel or PW segment-based) is not feasible after a 
  failure event and that (iii) the PE upstream to the failure receives 
  by means of OAM mechanisms a message indicating that a subset of 
  Egress T-PEs are detached from the PW tree, the solution SHOULD allow 
  the upstream PE to re-compute the path to those particular Egress T-
  PEs. If the upstream PE failed to compute an alternative path, the 
  procedure SHOULD be propagated upstream until the Ingress-PE is 
  reached. 
   
  It is also assumed that recovery procedures can be implemented at the 
  underlying P2P or P2MP LSP layer, using classic recovery techniques. 
  These procedures could be used to provide faster recovery time in 
  case of link or node failure affecting this layer. 
   
  A mechanism should be implemented to avoid race conditions between 
  recovery at the PSN level and recovery at the PW level. 
   
   
5.6. Advertisement of P2MP Capability 
   
  The solution should be completely backward compatible with  
  the current PW standards. The solution should take into account the 
  capability advertisement and negotiation procedures for the T-PEs 
  implementing P2MP MS-PW endpoints and branch S-PEs. 
   
  Implementation of OAM mechanisms also implies the advertisement of PE 
  capabilities to support specific OAM features. The solution SHOULD 
  allow advertising P2MP OAM PW capabilities.    
   
5.7. Scalability 
   
  In definition of solution for P2MP MS-PW a particular attention must 
  dedicated to scalability. 
   
  The solution MUST be designed to scale as well as linearly with an 
  increase in the number of leaves, Egress T-PEs, branch S-PEs. The 
  scalability issues MUST be addressed for the control plane (e.g. 
  addressing of PW endpoints, number of signaling sessions, etc) and 
  for data plane (e.g. duplication of PW segments, OAM mechanism, etc). 
   
   
5.8. Order of Magnitude 
   
  This section will be filled in a future version. 
   
  Number of Egress T-PE per tree, TAII per Egress T-PE, S-PE crossed, 
  replication supported per S-PE, dynamicity (Leaf Grafting/Pruning) 
  required, etc.
