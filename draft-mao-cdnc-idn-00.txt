Abstract  
  
There are great demands on using someone's native language to surf 
the Internet around the world. Internationalized domain name system 
has been introduced to meet the demand. However, due to many 
technical and policy issues, IDN may provide malicious rogues the 
opportunities to mislead users to unintended third party website, 
thus cause security issues and threat the stabilization of the

Internet. CDNC recognize the complexity of the issue and make advises 
to avoid the threat. To simplify the issue, CDNC suggest 
internationalize the ccTLD before any moves on gTLD. Also, the 
approval on internationalize a ccTLD should based on the readiness of 
the respective registry and the support from the respective 
government. The following document fully demonstrated the principles 
and procedure to internationalize ccTLD that recommended by CDNC.

1. Introduction 
 
The Internet from its birth was in English. In its early years in the 
United States of America, it has produced tremendous social and 
economical wealth. Not for long before it had grown into other 
countries of the globe, and people speaking languages other than 
English had also enjoyed some wealth the new technology had brought. 
However, the language barrier has gradually shown its limitation on 
the further expansion of the Internet usage in non-English speaking 
countries. 
 
There are multiple approaches to solve the problem, fully 
internationalize the domain name system is one of the most critical 
element for domain name is the key element in locating the resource 
on the Internet. Internet users have longed for a domain name system 
in their native language and expect one day they can fully overcome 
the problem they are now facing. 
 
Chinese Domain Name Consortium (CDNC) has seen the needs and has 
explored means to fulfill the need. After careful consideration, CDNC 
determined that Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) is the solution 
and there is adequate technical resource to achieve it. CDNC also 
consider it is the right time to start internationalizing the Country 
Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) names. In this paper, CDNC has 
presented its principles and suggestions on internationalizing the 
domain names systems.

 2. Necessity of IDN 
 
>From its research, CDNC has summarized prerequisites, advantages and 
necessities in implementing fully internationalized domain name 
system. The prerequisites are: 
 
 2.1 Prerequisites 
 
2.1.1 Market Needs 
 
As the statistics shows, as of September 2004, over 64.8% of the 
global Internet users are not English speakers, and their countries 
and regions build up over 66% of the world economy 
(http://glreach.com/globstats/). Take China for example, its Internet 
user population has grown up to more than 104 million by the end of 
June, 2005 (CNNIC Statistical Survey Report, published in July 2005). 
Statistics also shows that about 90% of the Internet users prefer to 
access the content in their native languages. Language barrier has 
become a major drawback on Internet popularization in non-English 
speaking countries, and its impact is more significant in countries 
which language is non-alphabetical, such as China, Japan, and Korea.  
 
Domain name is the single most important way to locate resources on 
the Internet. To date, there are over 240 country specified Top Level 
Domains in the world, represents over 240 countries and regions. Most 
of these ccTLD users are non-English speakers. Although these 
countries and regions had accelerated their development in ccTLDs, 
their users are longed for surfing Internet fully using their native 
language. Thus, internationalizing the domain name system is in 
urgent need, the IDN is in high market demand. And with the rapid 
growth of Internet users in countries like China, Japan and Korea, 
the IDN market grows tremendously and becomes enormous.  
 
2.1.2 Adequate Technology Resources 
 
Engineers in these countries recognized the importance of IDN and 
allocated their effort to develop technical solutions to meet the 
need. CDNC is the frontier in this field, and achieved many 
breakthroughs in the research. From 2003 to 2004, IETF published a 
series of RFCs, namely RFC3490, RFC3491, RFC3492, RFC3454 and RFC3743. 
They all perfectly proved that implementing IDN is stable and 
feasible. Especially, RFC3743 addressed the potential risk of 
phishing in IDNs, and set up the standard to resolve the problem. 
When registries follow the respective guideline, it will dramatically 
reduce the number of similar-looking IDNs, which will in turn reduce 
the possibility of phishing?use of IDNs. 
 
Nowadays, the technology is mature and stable, and there are abundant 
technical forces to ensure its workability and stability, all of 
 
 
 CDNC                 Expires - March 2006                 [Page 3] 
  Internet draft                                 IDN September 2005 
 
 
these have ensured that there is no negative impact on the current 
domain name system.  
 
2.1.3 Governmental Support 
 
Governments in these countries and regions are fully aware of the 
importance of IDN and are very supportive in the research and 
deployment. With sufficient negotiation with local governments, most 
ccTLD registries may obtain official supports when submit their 
proposals to ICANN. 
 
 2.2 Advantages of IDN 
 
There are four major advantages in implementing IDN: 
IDN makes the Internet friendly to non-English speakers; 
More achievement in applications of Email, FTP, and etc; 
It is the most effective way to popularize the use of the Internet in 
non-English speaking communities;  
There is a need for respecting and guaranteeing the culture 
diverseness and special interests of people in different regions. 
 
 2.3 What if we do not strike while the iron is hot? 
 
If we do not take chance to push forward the project now, potential 
IDN users with exigent needs may choose other uncertain solutions, 
and they may threaten the consolidation of the Internet standards and 
the operational stability of the Internet. 
 
 3. The Principles 
CDNC strongly recommend the following five principles to ICANN when 
deploying IDN: 
 
1) Give the priority to internationalizing ccTLDs. To ensure the 
system stability, it is recommended to internationalize ccTLD before 
internationalize gTLD.  
 
2) For convenience purpose, only one form of language character 
variant of internationalized ccTLD is accepted. Considering that some 
countries or regions may have character variants, only one form of 
character sets shall be chosen for IDN use by each sponsored registry. 
 
3) Supported by their own governments, ccTLD registries or authorized 
agencies make their own choice of which IDN character sets for their 
ccTLDs. 
 
4) Clearly state the necessity, pros and cons for implementing 
internationalized ccTLDs in each proposal that submitted to ICANN.

  Internet draft                                  IDN September 2005 
 
 
5) Register and operate the Internationalized ccTLDs in the root DNS 
server in the form of IDNA Punycode. 
 
 4. Suggestions 
CDNC suggest ICANN to form an evaluation committee on 
internationalizing ccTLDs. The committee shall compose of 
representatives from gNSO and ccNSO, experienced DNS engineers, if 
possible, even directors of ICANN board. The whole process shall be 
transparent and open for public inputs. 
 
The main tasks of the committee should be: 
 
4.1 Control the Sponsor's Qualification 
 
The proposal shall be submitted by corresponding ccTLD registry or 
government accredited institution/agency which meets the following 
criteria: 
 
The country/region it serves has certain market needs; 
Possessing abundant technical force in staff, equipment and operation; 
Having broad support from the local government and Internet community; 
Possessing adequate financial resources. 
 
4.2 Ask for Government's Approval 
 
The IDN ccTLD proposal shall be fully supported by the corresponding 
government;  
 
The committee shall request the sponsor to provide the approval 
documentaries issued by the government before its approval. 
 
4.3 Draft the Test Bed Evaluation Report 
 
The committee is recommended to set certain Benchmarks and conduct a 
full scale evaluation on the proposed internationalized ccTLD during 
its initial operation, and then submit the evaluation report to ICANN 
board for its final approval. The sponsored registry shall officially 
launch the registration service only after obtaining the approval of 
ICANN. If the report shows that the performance is not eligible, the 
evaluation committee shall reject the application and ask the 
sponsored registry to make improvement and resubmit the proposal 
afterwards.

 5. Conclusion  
In conclusion, CDNC consider with all the market needs, governmental 
supports, and the adequate technology resources, it is the right time 
to internationalize ccTLDs. IDN makes the Internet more accessible; 
it enables more achievement in applications of Email, FTP, and etc; 
it helps Internet usage popularize further into every corner of the 
globe, especially in the non-English speaking communities; It helps 
to preserve culture diverseness and protect special interests of 
people in different regions.  
 
 6. Security Considerations 
IDN homograph attacks allow an attacker/phisher to spoof the 
domain/URLs of businesses. RFC3743 addressed the potential risk of 
"phishing" in IDNs, and set up the standard to resolve the problem. 
When registries follow the respective guideline, it will dramatically 
reduce the number of similar-looking IDNs, which will in turn reduce 
the possibility of phishing-use of IDNs. It's proved that 
implementing IDN is stable and feasible, and has no negative impact 
on the current DN system.
