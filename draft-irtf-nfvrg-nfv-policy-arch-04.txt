       Policy Architecture and Framework for NFV Infrastructures
                  draft-irtf-nfvrg-nfv-policy-arch-04


Abstract

   A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support NFV
   environments, where policies are used to enforce business rules and
   to specify resource constraints in a number of subsystems. This
   document approaches the policy framework and architecture from the
   perspective of overall orchestration requirements for services
   involving multiple subsystems. The framework extends beyond common
   orchestration constraints across compute, network, and storage
   subsystems to include energy conservation. This document also
   analyses policy scope, global versus local policies, static versus
   dynamic versus autonomic policies, policy actions and translations,
   policy conflict detection and resolution, interactions among policies
   engines, and a hierarchical policy architecture/framework to address
   the demanding and growing requirements of NFV environments. These
   findings may also be applicable to cloud infrastructures in general.

1. Introduction

   This document discusses the policy architecture and framework to
   support Network Function Virtualization (NFV) [11] infrastructures.
   In these environments, policies are used to enforce business rules
   and to specify resource constraints, e.g., energy constraints, in a
   number of subsystems, e.g., compute, storage, network, and etc., and
   across subsystems. These subsystems correspond to the different
   "infrastructure domains" identified by the NFV ISG Infrastructure
   Working Group [8][10][7].

   The current work in the area of policy for NFV is mostly considered
   in the framework of general cloud services, and typically focused on
   individual subsystems and addressing very specific use cases or
   environments. For example, [11] addresses network subsystem policy
   for network virtualization, [19] and [20] are open source projects in
   the area of network policy as part of the OpenDaylight [21] software
   defined networking (SDN) controller framework, [18] specifies an
   information model for network policy, [13] focuses on placement and
   migration policies for distributed virtual computing, [24] is an open
   source project in OpenStack [22] to address policy for general cloud
   environments.

   This document approaches policy, policy framework, and policy
   architecture for NFV services from the perspective of overall
   orchestration requirements for services involving multiple
   subsystems, and can be applied to the general case of any cloud-based
   service. The analysis extends beyond common orchestration constraints
   across compute, network, and storage subsystems to also include
   energy conservation constraints applicable to NFV and other
   environments. The analysis in this document also extends beyond a
   single virtual Point of Presence (vPoP) or administrative domain to
   include multiple data centers and networks forming hierarchical
   domain architectures [12]. The focus of this document is not general
   policy theory, which has already been intensively studied and
   documented on numerous publications over the past 10 to 15 years (see
   [18], [27], [17], [28], and [3] to name a few). This document's
   purpose is to discuss and document a policy architecture that uses
   known policy concepts and theories to address the unique requirements
   of NFV services including multiple vPoPs and networks forming
   hierarchical domain architectures [12].

   With the above goals, this document analyses policy scope, global
   versus local policies, static versus dynamic versus autonomic
   policies, policy actions and translations of actions, policy conflict
   detection and resolution (which can be relevant to resource
   management in service chains [16]), the interactions among policies
   engines from the different vPoPs and network subsystems, and a
   hierarchical policy architecture/framework to address the demanding
   and growing requirements of NFV environments. These findings may also
   be applicable to cloud infrastructures in general.


2. Policy Intent Statement versus Subsystem Actions and Configurations

   Policies define which states of deployment are in compliance with the
   policy, and, by logic negation, which ones are not. The compliance
   statement in a policy may define specific actions, e.g., "a given
   customer is [not allowed to deploy VNF X]", where VNF refers to a
   Virtual Network Function, or quasi-specific actions, e.g., "a given
   customer [must be given platinum treatment]." Quasi-specific actions
   differ from the specific ones in that the former requires an
   additional level of translation or interpretation, which will depend
   on the subsystems where the policy is being evaluated, while the
   latter does not require further translation or interpretation.

   In the previous examples, "VNF X" defines a specific VNF type, i.e.,
   "X" in this case, while "platinum treatment" could be translated to
   an appropriate resource type depending on the subsystem. For example,
   in the compute subsystem this could be translated to servers of a
   defined minimum performance specification, while in the network
   subsystem this could be translated to a specific Quality of Service
   (QoS) level treatment.

   The actions defined in a policy may be translated to subsystem
   configurations. For example, when "platinum treatment" is translated
   to a specific QoS level treatment in a networking subsystem, one of
   the outcomes (there can be multiple ones) of the policy could be the
   configuration of network elements (physical or virtual) to mark that
   customer's traffic to a certain DSCP (DiffServ Code Point) level
   (Figure 1). Some may refer to the QoS configuration above as a policy
   in itself, e.g., [27], [28], [4], and [17]. In this document, such
   domain configurations are called policy enforcement technologies to
   set them apart from the actual policy intent, e.g., "a given customer
   must be given platinum treatment" as in the above example.

   Describing intent using a high-level policy language instead of
   directly describing configuration details allows for the decoupling
   of the desired intent from the actual configurations, which are
   subsystem dependent, as shown in the previous example (Figure 1). The

   translation of a policy into appropriate subsystem configurations
   requires additional information that is usually subsystem and
   technology dependent. Therefore, policies should not be written in
   terms of policy enforcement technologies. Policies should be
   translated at the subsystems using the appropriate policy provides a
   few examples where the policy "a given customer must be given
   platinum treatment" is translated to appropriate configurations at
   the respective subsystems.

   The above may sound like a discussion about "declarative" versus
   "imperative" policies. We are actually postulating that "imperative
   policy" is just a derived subsystem configuration using an
   appropriate policy enforcement technology to support an actually
   intended policy.

3. Global vs Local Policies

   Some policies may be subsystem specific in scope, while others may
   have broader scope and interact with multiple subsystems. For
   example, a policy constraining certain customer types (or specific
   customers) to only use certain server types for VNF or Virtual
   Machine (VM) deployment would be within the scope of the compute
   subsystem. A policy dictating that a given customer type (or specific

   customers) must be given "platinum treatment" could have different
   implications on different subsystems. As shown in Figure 1, that
   "platinum treatment" could be translated to servers of a given
   performance specification in a compute subsystem and storage of a
   given performance specification in a storage subsystem.

   Policies with broader scope, or global policies, would be defined
   outside affected subsystems and enforced by a global policy engine
   (Figure 2), while subsystem-specific policies or local policies,
   would be defined and enforced at the local policy engines of the
   respective subsystems.

   Examples of sub-system policies can include thresholds for
   utilization of sub-system resources, affinity/anti-affinity
   constraints with regard to utilization or mapping of sub-system
   resources for specific tasks, network services, or workloads, or
   monitoring constraints regarding under-utilization or over-
   utilization of sub-system resources.

4. Static vs Dynamic vs Autonomic Policies

   Policies can be defined based on a diverse set of constraints and
   sources, e.g., an operator's energy cost reduction policy based on
   the time-varying energy rates imposed by a utility company supplying
   energy to a given region or an operator's "green" policy based on the
   operator's green operational requirements, which may drive a
   reduction in energy consumption despite of potentially increased
   energy costs.

   While "static" policies can be imposed based on past learned behavior
   in the systems, "dynamic" policies can be define that would override
   "static" policies due to dynamically varying constraints. For
   example, if a system needs to provided significantly additional
   scaling of users in a given geographic area due to a sporting or a
   concert event at that location, then a dynamic policy can be
   superimposed to temporarily override a static policy to support
   additional users at that location for a certain period of time.
   Alternatively, if energy costs significantly rise on a particular
   day, then an energy cost threshold could be dynamically raised to
   avoid policy violation on that day.

   Support for autonomic policies may also be required, such as an auto-
   scaling policy that allows a resource (compute/storage/network/energy
   resource) to be scaled up or down as needed. For example, a policy
   specifying that a VNF can be scaled up or down to accommodate traffic
   needs.


5. Hierarchical Policy Framework

   So far, we have referenced compute, network, and storage as
   subsystems examples. However, the following subsystems may also
   support policy engines and subsystem specific policies:

      - SDN Controllers, e.g., OpenDaylight [21].
      - OpenStack [22] components such as, Neutron, Cinder, Nova, and
      etc.
      - Directories, e.g., LDAP, ActiveDirectory, and etc.
      - Applications in general, e.g., standalone or on top of
      OpenDaylight or OpenStack.
      - Physical and virtual network elements, e.g., routers, firewalls,
      application delivery controllers (ADCs), and etc.
      - Energy subsystems, e.g., OpenStack Neat [25].

   Therefore, a policy framework may involve a multitude of subsystems.
   Subsystems may include other lower level subsystems, e.g., Neutron
   [26] would be a lower level subsystem in the OpenStack subsystem. In

   other words, the policy framework is hierarchical in nature, where
   the policy engine of a subsystem may be viewed as a higher level
   policy engine by lower level subsystems. In fact, the global policy
   engine in Figure 2 could be the policy engine of a Data Center
   subsystem and multiple Data Center subsystems could be grouped in a
   region containing a region global policy engine. In addition, one
   could define regions inside regions, hierarchically, as shown in
   Figure 3.

   Metro and wide-area network (WAN) used to interconnect data centers
   would also be independent subsystems with their own policy engines.

6. Policy Conflicts and Resolution

   Policies should be stored in databases accessible by the policy
   engines. For example, the local policies defined for the Compute
   subsystem in Figure 2 would be stored in a database accessible by the
   local policy engine in that subsystem.

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV   September 7, 2016


   As a new policy is added to a subsystem, the subsystem's policy
   engine should perform conflict checks. For example, a simple conflict
   would be created if a new policy states that "customer A must not be
   allowed to use VNF X", while an already existing policy states that
   "customer A is allowed to use VNF X". In this case, the conflict
   should be detected and an appropriate policy conflict resolution
   mechanism should be initiated.

   The nature of the policy conflict resolution mechanism would depend
   on how the new policy is being entered into the database. If an
   administrator is manually attempting to enter that policy, the
   conflict resolution could entail a warning message and rejection of
   the new policy. The administrator would then decide whether or not to
   replace the existing policy with the new one.

   When policies are batched for later inclusion in the database, the
   administrator should run a preemptive conflict resolution check on
   those policies before committing to include them in the database at a
   future time. However, running a preemptive conflict resolution check
   does not guarantee that there will be no conflicts at the time the
   batched policies are actually included in the database, since other
   policies could have been added in the interim that cause conflicts
   with those batched policies.

   To avoid conflicts between batched policies waiting for later
   inclusion in the database and new policies being immediately added to
   the database, one could run a preemptive conflict resolution check
   against database policies and also batched policies every time new
   policies are added to the database. However, this may not be
   sufficient in case of separate administrative domains. A region
   administration could define batched polices to be pushed to the
   Compute subsystem of a Data Center at a later time. However, the
   Compute subsystem may be a separate administrative domain from that
   of the region administrative domain. In this case, the Compute
   subsystem may not be allowed to run preemptive policy conflict checks
   against the batched policies defined at the region administrative
   domain. Thus, there is a need for a reactive policy conflict
   resolution mechanism besides preemptive techniques.

   The above discussions implicitly assumed that policies are
   individually evaluated for conflicts and individually committed
   without regard to other policies. However, a set of policies could be
   labeled as part of a same "Commit Group", where the whole set of
   policies in the Commit Group must be committed for a desired result
   to be obtained. In this case, the conflict resolution mechanism would
   need to verify that none of the policies in the Commit Group
   conflicts with currently committed policies before the Commit Group
   is added (in other words, committed) to the policy database.
 


Figueira, et al.         Expires March 11, 2017                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV   September 7, 2016


   The Commit Group conflict detection mechanism and subsequent addition
   to the database should be implemented as an atomic process, i.e., no
   changes to the policy database should be allowed by other processes
   until either the whole Commit Group is checked and committed or a
   conflict is detected and the process stopped, to avoid multiple
   writers issues.

   The above described atomic Commit Group conflict detection and policy
   commit mechanism would eliminate the need for  Commit Group rollback.
   A rollback could be required if policies in a Commit Group were to be
   checked for conflicts and committed one by one, since the detection
   of a subsequent policy conflict in the Commit Group would require the
   rollback of previously committed policies in that group.

6.1. Soft vs Hard Policy Constraints

   Policies at any level in the policy hierarchy can be either soft or
   hard. A soft policy imposes a soft constraint in a system that can be
   violated without causing any catastrophic failure in the system. A
   hard policy imposes a hard constraint in the system that must not be
   violated. An example of a soft constraint is the degree of
   underutilization (for example, a 40% utilization threshold could be
   used as a soft constraint) of compute servers with regard to CPU
   utilization. In such a case, when this soft constraint is violated,
   the system continues to function, although it may consume more energy
   (due to a non-linear dependence of the energy utilization as a
   function of the CPU utilization) compared to a task allocation across
   multiple servers after workload consolidation is performed.
   Alternatively, a soft constraint could be violated if the network
   bandwidth exceeds a certain fraction (say 80%) of the available
   bandwidth, the energy utilization exceeds a certain value, or the
   memory utilization falls below a certain value (say 30%). An example
   of a hard constraint could be to disallow a desired mean CPU
   utilization across allocated workloads in a compute subsystem to
   exceed a certain high threshold (such as 90%), or to disallow the
   number of CPUs allocated for a set of workloads to exceed a certain
   value, or to disallow the network bandwidth across workloads to
   exceed a certain value (say 98% of the maximum available bandwidth).

   When considering policy conflicts, violation of policies across hard
   policy constraints is undesirable, and must be avoided. A conflict
   resolution could be possible by relaxing one or more of the hard
   constraints to an extent that is mutually satisfactory to the
   imposers of the policies. Alternatively, as discussed earlier, a new
   hard policy that conflicts with existing policies is not admitted
   into the system. Violation of policies across soft policy constraints
   or between one or more hard policy constraints and one or more soft
   policy constraints can be allowed, such that one or more soft policy
 


Figueira, et al.         Expires March 11, 2017                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV   September 7, 2016


   constraints are violated without hard constraints being violated.
   Despite soft constraints being violated, it is desirable to have a
   region of operating conditions that would allow the system to
   operate. For admission of new policy constraints, whether hard or
   soft, one should ensure that the overall system has a feasible region
   for operation given the existing constraints, and the new constraints
   under consideration. When such a feasible region is not possible, one
   can consider relaxing one or more of the existing or new constraints
   to allow such policies to be admitted.


7. Policy Pub/Sub Bus

   In the previous section, we considered policy conflicts within a same
   level subsystem. For example, new local policies added to the Compute
   subsystem conflicting with existing local policies at that subsystem.
   However, more subtle conflicts are possible between global and local
   policies.

   A global policy may conflict with subsystems' local policies.
   Consider the following Compute subsystem local policy: "Platinum
   treatment must be provided using server of type A."

   The addition of the Global policy "Platinum treatment must be
   provided using server subtype A-1" would intrude into the Compute
   subsystem by redefining the type of server to be used for a
   particular service treatment. While one could argue that such global
   policy should not be permitted, this is an event that requires
   detection and proper resolution. A possible resolution is for the
   Compute subsystem to import the more restrictive policy into its
   local database. The original local policy would remain in the
   database as is along with the new restrictive policy. The local
   policy engine would then enforce the more restricted form of the
   policy after this policy change, which could make already existing
   resource allocations non-compliant and requiring corrective actions,
   e.g., Platinum treatment being currently provided by a server of type
   A instead of a server of type A-1.

   If the new Global policy read "Platinum treatment must be provided
   using server of types A or B" instead, the Compute subsystem would
   not need to do anything different, since the Compute subsystem has a
   more restrictive local policy in place, i.e., "Platinum treatment
   must be provided using server of type A."

   The above examples demonstrate the need for subsystems to subscribe
   to policy updates at the Global policy level. A policy
   publication/subscription (pub/sub) bus would be required as shown in
   Figure 4.

                     Figure 4: A Policy Pub/Sub Bus

   A policy conflict may force policies to change scope. Consider the
   following existing policies in a Data Center:

   Compute subsystem policy: "Platinum treatment requires a server of
   type A or B."

   Storage subsystem policy: "Platinum treatment requires a server
   storage of type X or Y."

   Now consider the outcome of adding the following new Global policy:
   "Platinum treatment requires a server of type A when storage of type
   X is used or a server of type B when storage of type Y is used."

   This new Global policy intrudes into the Compute and Storage
   subsystems. Again, one could argue that such global policy should not
 


Figueira, et al.         Expires March 11, 2017                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV   September 7, 2016


   be permitted. Nevertheless, this is an event that would require
   detection and proper resolution. This Global policy causes a conflict
   because the Compute and Storage subsystems can no longer
   independently define whether to use a server of type A or B or
   storage of type X or Y, respectively. If the Compute subsystem
   selects server of type A for a customer and the Storage subsystem
   selects storage of type Y for that same customer service the Global
   policy is violated. In conclusion, if such global policy is
   permitted, the Compute and Storage subsystems can no longer make such
   selections. A possible conflict resolution is for the Compute and
   Storage subsystems to relegate policy enforcement for such resources
   to the Global policy engine. In this example, the Global Policy
   engine would need to coordinate with the Compute and Storage
   subsystems the selection of appropriate resource types to satisfy
   that policy.

   That suggests that the policy pub/sub bus should in fact be an
   integral part of the northbound service interfaces (NBI) of the
   subsystems in the hierarchy. Such issue was analyzed in [12], where
   the concepts of service capability, service availability, and service
   instantiation were introduced to enable a higher-level subsystem to
   properly select services and resources from lower-level subsystems to
   satisfy existing policies.

   The above example demonstrates again the need for subsystems to
   subscribe to policy updates at the higher policy level (the Global
   policy level in this example) as shown in Figure 4.

   If, as demonstrated, a Global policy may "hijack" or "nullify" local
   policies of subsystems, what exactly makes the scope of a policy
   local versus global then?

   Proposition: A Local Policy does not affect the compliance state
   imposed by global Policies or the local policies of other subsystems.

   The above non-exhaustive examples demonstrate that global and local
   policies may conflict in subtle ways. Policy conflicts will also
   policy framework requires a policy pub/sub bus between all levels to
   allow for conflict detection, conflict information propagation, and
   conflict resolution (Figure 5).

7.1 Pub/Sub Bus Name Space

   As described above, a higher tier policy engine would communicate
   policies to lower tier policy engines using a policy pub/sub bus.
   Conversely, lower tier policy engines would communicate their
   configured policies and services to the higher tier policy engine
   using the same policy pub/sub bus. Such communications require each
   policy pub/sub bus to have a pre-defined/pre-configured policy "name
   space". For example, a pub/sub bus could define services using the
   name space "Platinum", "Gold", and "Silver". A policy could then be
   communicated over that pub/sub bus specifying a Silver service
   requirement.

   In a hierarchical policy framework, a policy engine may use more than
   one policy pub/sub bus, e.g., a policy pub/sub bus named "H" to
   communicate with a higher tier policy engine and a policy pub/sub bus
   named "L" to communicate with lower tier policy engines. As the name
   spaces of policy pub/sub buses H and L may be different, the policy
   engine would translate policies defined using the policy pub/sub bus
   H name space to policies defined using the policy pub/sub bus L name
   space, and vice-versa. For example, suppose that the policy pub/sub
   bus H name space defines service levels named Platinum, Gold, and
   Silver and that the policy pub/sub bus L name space does not define
   such service levels, but defines QoS levels High, Medium, and Low.
   The policy engine would translate a policy to support Silver service,
   which is written using the policy pub/sub bus H name space, to an
   appropriate policy (or set of policies) written using the policy
   pub/sub bus L name space, e.g., QoS level Low.

   The described policy framework does not preclude use of a single/same
   name space throughout the hierarchy. However, to promote scalability
   and limit complexity, the name spaces of higher tier policy pub/sub
   buses should be limited to support higher level policies, since the
   higher the degree of specificity allowed at the higher tiers of the
   policy hierarchy the higher the operational complexity.

8. Examples

8.1 Establishment of a Multipoint Ethernet Service

   Consider a service provider with an NFV infrastructure (NFVI) with
   multiple vPoPs, where each vPoP is a separate administrative domain.
   A customer "Z" requests the creation of a "multipoint Silver Ethernet
   service" between three of its sites, which are connected to service
   provider's vPoPs A, B, and C. The customer request is carried out
   using a service provider self-service web portal, which offers
   customers multiple service type options, e.g., point-to-point and
   multipoint Ethernet services, and multiple service levels per service
   type, e.g., Platinum, Gold, and Silver Ethernet services, where the
   different service levels may represent different service
   specifications in terms of QoS, latency, and etc. The web portal
   relays the request to a service provider's OSS/BSS. The service
   request is stored as a service policy that reads as: "multipoint
   Silver Ethernet service between vPoPs A, B, and C for customer Z".

   The OSS/BSS subsystem would communicate the service request and
   requirements as a policy to a global NFV Orchestrator (NFVO)
   subsystem using the name space of the pub/sub bus between these two
   subsystems (see Section 7.1). For example, the OSS/BSS could
   translate "Silver" service level into a policy defined using a
   Network Service (NS) Flavor ID, as defined by the name space of
   pub/sub bus between the OSS/BSS and the NFVO.

   The service provider's vPoP NFV infrastructure architecture may vary
   depending on the size of each vPoP and other specific needs of the
   service provider. For example, a vPoP may have a local NFVO subsystem
   and one or more local Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) subsystems
   (as in Figure 6). In this case, the global NFVO subsystem would
   communicate the service request and requirements as a policy to the
   local NFVOs of vPoPs A, B, and C.

   At each vPoP, the local NFVO (and VNF Managers) would carry out the
   requested service policy based on the local configurations of
   respective subsystems and current availability of resources. For
   example, the requested service may translate in vPoP A to use a
   specific vCE (virtual customer edge) VNF type, say vCE_X, while in
   vPoP B it may translate to use a different vCPE VNF type, say vCPE_Y,
   due to local subsystem configurations (refer to Section 2 for a
   discussion on subsystem actions and configurations). Similarly, the
   local VIM interaction with the vPoP's compute, network, and storage
   subsystems may lead to local configurations of these subsystems
   driven by the translation of the policies received by the respective
   subsystems (see Section 3 for a discussion on global versus local
   policies). Note that the original policy at the OSS/BSS level is
 


Figueira, et al.         Expires March 11, 2017                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV   September 7, 2016


   translated throughout the policy hierarchy by respective policy
   engines to fit the name spaces of the associated pub/sub buses in the
   hierarchy.

   The global NFVO subsystem could also communicate a policy defining
   the requirements to create a multipoint Ethernet service between
   vPoPs A, B, and C to a WAN infrastructure management (WIM) subsystem
   (not shown in Figure 6). The WIM subsystem could oversee a hierarchy
   of other subsystems, e.g., SDN multi-domain architecture of
   controllers deployed as a hierarchy of network regions (see [12]).
   Network subsystems would translate locally received policies to local
   configurations (again, refer to Section 2 for a discussion on
   subsystem actions and configurations).

   As depicted in Figure 6, policy communications would employ a policy
   pub/sub bus between the subsystems' policy engines in the policy
   hierarchy (see Section 7). The global NFVO subsystem should have
   visibility into the policies defined locally at each vPoP to be able
   to detect any potential global policy conflicts, e.g., a local vPoP
   administrator could add a local policy that violates or conflicts
   with a global policy. In addition, the global NFVO subsystem would
   benefit from being able to import the currently configured services
   at each vPoP. The global NFVO would use such information to monitor
   global policy conformance and also to facilitate detection of policy
   violations when new global policies are created, e.g., a global level
   administrator is about to add a new global policy that, if committed,
   would make certain already configured services a violation of the
   policy. The publication of subsystem service tables for consumption
   by a global policy engine is a concept used in the Congress [24]
   OpenStack [22] project.

8.2 Policy-Based NFV Placement and Scheduling

   One of the goals of NFV is to allow a Service Provider (SP) offer the
   NFV infrastructure as a service to other Service Providers as
   Customers - this is called NFVIaaS [6]. In this context, it may be
   desirable for a Service Provider to run virtual network elements
   (e.g., virtual routers, virtual firewalls, and etc.) as virtual
   machine instances inside the infrastructure of another Service
   Provider. In this document, we call the former a "customer SP" and
   the latter an "NFVIaaS SP."

   There are many reasons for a customer SP to require the services of
   an NFVIaaS SP, including: to meet performance requirements (e.g.,
   latency or throughput) in locations where the customer SP does not
   have physical data center presence, to allow for expanded customer
   reach, regulatory requirements, and etc.

   As VNFs are virtual machines, their deployment in such NFVIaaS SPs
   would share some of the same placement restrictions (i.e., placement
   policies) as those intended for Cloud Services. However, VNF
   deployment will drive support for unique placement policies, given
   VNF's stringent service level specifications (SLS) required/imposed
   by customer SPs. Additionally, NFV DCs or NFV PoPs [8] often have
   capacity, energy and other constraints - thus, optimizing the overall
   resource usage based on policy is an important part of the overall
   solution.

   This section describes an example [15] of a global policy written in
   Datalog [3] applicable to compute to promote energy conservation for
   the NFVIaaS use case in an OpenStack framework. The goal of that
   global policy is to address the energy efficiency requirements
   described in the ETSI NFV Virtualization Requirements [9].

   A related energy efficiency use case using analytics-driven policies
   in the context of OpenStack Congress [24] policy as a service was
   presented and demonstrated at the Vancouver OpenStack summit [14],
   where the Congress policy engine delegated VM placement to a VM
   placement engine that migrated under-utilized VMs to save energy.


8.2.1 Policy Engine Role in NFV Placement and Scheduling

   A policy engine may facilitate policy-based resource placement and
   scheduling of VMs in an NFVIaaS environment. In this role, a policy
   engine (Figure 7) would determine optimized placement and scheduling
   choices based on the constraints specified by current resource
   placement and scheduling policies. The policy engine would evaluate
   such policies based on event triggers or programmable timers.

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV   September 7, 2016


   In one instantiation, a policy engine would interface with a
   "Measurement Collector" (e.g., OpenStack Ceilometer [23]) to
   periodically retrieve instantaneous per-server CPU utilization, in
   order to compute a table of per-server average CPU utilization. In an
   alternative instantiation, the Measurement Collector could itself
   compute per-server average CPU utilization and provide that
   information to the policy engine. The latter approach would reduce
   overhead, since it would avoid too frequent pulling of stats from the
   Measurement Collector.

   Other average utilization parameters such as VM CPU utilization, VM
   Memory utilization, VM disk read IOPS, Network utilization/latency,
   and etc. could also be used by the policy engine to enforce other
   types of placement policies.

        Figure 7: NFVIaaS Architecture for Policy Based Resource
                        Placement and Scheduling

   In the ETSI NFV Architectural Framework [7], the Policy Engine is
   part of the Orchestrator and the Measurement Collector is part of the
   Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM).

8.2.2 Policy-based NFV Placement and Scheduling with OpenStack

   Consider an NFVIaaS SP that owns a multitude of mini NFV data centers
   managed by OpenStack [22] where:

   -  The Policy Engine function is performed by OpenStack Congress
   [24].

   -  The Measurement Collector function is performed by OpenStack
   Celiometer [23].

   -  The Policy Engine has access to the OpenStack Nova database that
   stores records of mapping of virtual machines to physical servers.

   An exemplary mini NFV DC configuration is used in this example, as
   described below:

   -  210 physical servers in 2U rack server configuration spread over
   10 racks.

   -  4 types of physical servers each with a different system
   configuration and from a particular manufacturer. It is possible that
   the servers are all from the same or different manufacturers. For the
   purpose of this example, a server "type 1" is described. Server type
   1 has 32 virtual CPUs and 128GB DRAM from manufacturer x. Assume 55
   physical servers of type 1 per mini NFV DC.

   -  2 types of instances large.2 and large.3, which are described in
   Table 1. Each parameter has a minimum guarantee and a maximum usage
   limit.

   +--------+------------------+-------------------+---------------+
   |Instance|Virtual CPU Units |Memory (GB)        |Minimum/Maximum|
   |Type    |Minimum Guarantee |Minimum Guarantee  |Physical Server|
   |        |/Maximum Usage    |/Maximum Usage     |Utilization (%)|
   +--------+------------------+-------------------+---------------+
   |large.2 |     0/4          |    0/16           |  0/12.5       |
   |large.3 |     0/8          |    0/32           |  0/25         |
   +--------+------------------+-------------------+---------------+

                    Table 1: NFVIaaS Instance Types

   For the purpose of this example, the Mini NFV DC topology is
   considered static -- the above topology, including the network
   interconnection, is available through a simple file-based interface.

   Policy 1 (an exemplary NFV policy): In a descriptive language, Policy
   1 is as follows - "For physical servers of type 1, there can be at
   most only one active physical server with average overall utilization
   less than 50%." Policy 1 is an example of reactive enforcement. The
   goal of this policy is to address the energy efficiency requirements
   described in the ETSI NFV Virtualization Requirements [9].

   Policy 2 (another exemplary NFV policy): Policy 2 is designed to
   protect NFV instances from physical server failures. Policy 2 reads
   as follows in a descriptive language - "Not more than one VM of the
   same high availability (HA) group must be deployed on the same
   physical server". Policy 2 is an example of proactive and reactive
   enforcement.

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV   September 7, 2016


   Note that there may be cases where there may not be any placement
   solution respecting both policies given the current DC load. To avoid
   such cases, Policy 1 could be relaxed to: "Minimize the number of
   physical servers with average overall utilization less than 50%".

   Policy 1 calls for the identification of servers by type. OpenStack
   Congress would need to support server type, average CPU utilization,
   and be able to support additional performance parameters (in the
   future) to support additional types of placement policies. OpenStack
   Congress would run the policy check periodically or based on trigger
   events, e.g., deleting/adding VMs. In case OpenStack Congress detects
   a violation, it would determine optimized placement and scheduling
   choices so that current placement and scheduling policy are not
   violated.  

   A key goal of Policy 1 is to ensure that servers are not kept under
   low utilization, since servers have a non-linear power profile and
   exhibit relatively higher power consumption at lower utilization. 
   For example, in the active idle state as much as 30% of peak power is
   consumed. At the physical server level, instantaneous energy
   consumption can be accurately measured through IPMI standard. At a
   customer instance level, instantaneous energy consumption can be
   approximately measured using an overall utilization metric, which is
   a combination of CPU utilization, memory usage, I/O usage, and
   network usage. Hence, Policy 1 is written in terms of overall
   utilization and not power usage.

   The following example addressed the combined effect of Policy 1 and
   Policy 2.

   For an exemplary maximum usage scenario, 53 physical servers could be
   under peak utilization (100%), 1 server (server-a) could be under
   partial utilization (62.5%) with 2 instances of type large.3 and 1
   instance of type large.2 (this instance is referred as large.2.X1),
   and 1 server (server-b) could be under partial utilization (37.5%)
   with 3 instances of type large.2. Call these three instances
   large.2.X2, large.2.Y and large.2.Z

   One HA-group has been configured and two large.2 instances belong to
   this HA-group. To enforce Policy 2 large.2.X1 and large2.X2 that
   belong to the HA-group have been deployed in different physical
   servers, one in server-a and a second in server-b.  

   When one of the large.3 instances mapped to server-a is deleted from
   physical server type 1, Policy 1 will be violated, since the overall
   utilization of server-a falls to 37.5%, since two servers are
   underutilized (below 50%).

   OpenStack Congress, on detecting the policy violation, would use
   various constraint based placement techniques to find placements for
   physical server type 1 to address Policy 1 violation without breaking
   Policy 2. Constraint based placement involves a convex optimization
   framework [5]. Some of the algorithms that could be considered
   include linear programming [1], branch and bound [2], interior point
   methods, equality constrained minimization, non-linear optimization,
   and etc.

   Various new placements are described below:

   1) New placement 1: Move 2 of three instances of large.2 running on
   server-b to server-a. Overall utilization of server-a - 62.5%. 
   Overall utilization of server-b - 25%. large.2.X2 must not be one of
   the migrated instances.

   2) New placement 2: Move 1 instance of large.3 to server-b. Overall
   utilization of server-a - 12.5%. Overall utilization of server-b -
   62.5%.

   A third solution consisting of moving 3 large.2 instances to server-a
   cannot be adopted, since this violates Policy 2. Another policy
   minimizing the number of migrations could allow choosing between
   solutions (1) and (2) above.

   New placements 2 and 3 could be considered optimal, since they
   achieve maximal bin packing and open up the door for turning off
   server-a or server-b and maximizing energy efficiency.

   To detect violations of Policy 1, an example of a classification rule
   is expressed below in Datalog, the policy language used by OpenStack
   Congress.

   The database table exported by the Resource Placement and Scheduler
   for Policy 1 is described below:

      - server_utilization (physical_server, overall_util): Each
      database entry has the physical server and the calculated average
      overall utilization.

      - vm_host_mapping(vm, server): Each database entry gives the
      physical server on which VM is deployed.

      - anti-affinity_group(vm, group): Each entry gives the anti-
      affinity group to which a VM belongs.  

   Policy 1 in a Datalog [3] policy language is as follows:

      error (physical_server) :-
        nova: node (physical_server, "type1"),
        resource placement and scheduler:
          server_utilization (physical_server, overall_util < 50)

   Policy 2 (in Datalog policy language):

      error(vm) :-
        anti-affinity_group(vm1, grp1),
        anti-affinity_group(vm2, grp2),
        grp1 != grp2,
        nova: vm host mapping(vm1, server-1),
        nova:  vm host mapping(vm2,server-2),
        server-1 == server-2


9. Summary

   This document approached the policy framework and architecture from
   the perspective of overall orchestration requirements for services
   involving multiple subsystems. The analysis extended beyond common
   orchestration for compute, network, and storage subsystems to also
   include energy conservation constraints. This document also analyzed
   policy scope, global versus local policies, policy actions and
   translations, policy conflict detection and resolution, interactions
   among policies engines, and a hierarchical policy
   architecture/framework to address the demanding and growing
   requirements of NFV environments, applicable as well to general cloud
   infrastructures.

   The concept of NFV and the proposed policy architecture is applicable
   to service providers and also enterprises. For example, an enterprise
   branch office could have capacity and energy constraints similar to
   that of many service provider NFV vPoPs in constrained environments.
   This is an aspect that would be worth examining in detail in future
   work.

10. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not have any IANA considerations.

11. Security Considerations

   Security issues due to exchanging policies across different
   administrative domains are an aspect for further study.
