Abstract

   DNS Security Extensions enables the secure distribution of public
   keys over the Internet. This is a desirable feature for the SSH
   protocol.  This document defines the format for storing SSH host keys
   in KEY resource records.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Storing SSH Host Keys in DNS          January 2001


1. Introduction

   Key distribution, whether shared secret or public key, is a lingering
   issue in many security-aware protocols, and the SSH protocol [SSH-
   ARCH] is not an exception. DNS Security Extensions [RFC-2535] can
   provide one form of a key infrastructure on the Internet. By allowing
   the client to verify the server key, even without prior knowledge of
   said key, and out of band of the SSH protocol, the security of the
   SSH protocol has increased.

   Familiarity with DNS Security Extensions and the SSH protocol is
   assumed.

2. SSH Key Resource Records

   SSH Host Keys are stored as KEY RRs. The following sections describe
   how the flags, protocol, and algorithm are set.

   2.1 The KEY RR Flag Field

       The "flags" field is set as follows:

       Key "type" (bits 0 and 1): 00 (This key can be used for both
       authentication and confidentiality.)

       Key "name" (bits 6 and 7): 10 (This key is an "entity" or host
       key.)

   2.2 The Protocol Octect

       The protocol value is TBA by IANA.

   2.3 The KEY Algorithm Number Specification

       The algorithm is set as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC-2535].
       SSH does not place any additional restrictions on SSH host keys.
       RSA/MD5 keys use an algorithm value of 1, RSA/SHA1 keys use 5,
       and DSA keys use 3.

   2.4 KEY RDATA format

       Section 4.6 of the SSH transport layer protocol document [SSH-
       TRANS] describes the encoding format for SSH public keys. The DNS
       KEY encoding format is described in [RFC-2536] for DSA public
       keys and [RFC-2537] for RSA/MD5 public keys.

       The KEY RDATA format itself consists of the Flags Field, Protocol
       Octect, Algorithm, and public key, which can be converted from

       the SSH encoding to the DNS encoding using the descriptions
       mentioned.


3. Security Considerations

   Placing SSH host keys in DNS allows ssh programs and users to perform
   additional checks that may help foil man in the middle attacks. With
   DNSSEC deployed, SSH programs can rely on DNS as a secure key
   distribution mechanism, as discussed in the SSH architecture document
   [SSH-ARCH].

   There are 2 possible ways an SSH client can trust keys from DNS. The
   first is to perform full DNSSEC verification on the host key and all
   the zones containing the domain name up to a trusted zone. This
   requires the client to be configured with a trusted zone key and
   following the steps for SIG verification outlined in Sections 4 and
   6.3 of [RFC-2535].

   The other method is for the client to perform a SIG(0) or TSIG
   secured query to a nameserver. This method pushes the zone
   verification off to the nameserver, but uses SIG(0), defined in
   [RFC-2931], or TSIG, defined in [RFC-2845], to verify the query to
   the nameserver.

4. IANA Considerations

   This document specifies how SSH host keys can be placed in DNS, it
   also requests an assignment of a DNS KEY protocol value for this use.
   Guidance to IANA can be found in Section 3.1.3 of [RFC-2535].
