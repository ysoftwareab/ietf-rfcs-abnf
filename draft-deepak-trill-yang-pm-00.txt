1. Introduction

   Fault Management for TRILL is defined in [TRILLOAMFM]. TRILL Fault
   Management utilizes the [8021Q] CFM model and extends CFM with
   technology specific details. Those technology specific extensions are
   flow-entropy for multipath support, MEP addressing on TRILL
   identifiers, and so on. The extensions are explained in detail in
   [TRILLOAMFM].

   Performance Management for TRILL is defined in [TRILLOAMPM]. TRILL
   Performance Management utilizes the [Y.1731-2013/G.8013]  and extends
   it with Loss Measurement and Delay measurement.

   Generic OAM Yang model [GENYANGOAM] presents Generic Yang data model
   for all OAM technologies. 

   In this document we extend the YANG model defined in [GENYANGOAM] for
   TRILL OAM Performance management.

4. YANG Extension

   MEP Addressing is defined in Generic OAM YANG model[GENOAMYANG].
   TRILL OAM PM Yang is extended to augment MEP Configuration with
   Performance Management configuration and statistics for Delay
   Measurement and Performance Measurement.

      identity trill {     base goam:technology-types;       description
           "trill pm type";   }


4.1 MEP Address

   As defined in TRILL OAM Yang[TRILLOAMYANG] model. TRILL OAM Yang is
   referenced.

   As defined in TRILL OAM Yang[TRILLOAMYANG] model.

4.3 Context-id

   As defined in TRILL OAM Yang[TRILLOAMYANG] model.

4.4 RPC definition

   The rpc model facilitates issuing commands to a NETCONF server (in
   this case to the device that needs to execute the OAM command) and
   obtaining a response.

   Grouping Statements 1. loss-measurement-configuration-group 2.
   measurement-timing-group 3. delay-measurement-configuration-group

   defines input extension for Delay and Loss measurement.

4.4.1 create-loss-measurement

   RPC allows scheduling of one-way or two-way on-demand or proactive
   performance monitoring loss measurement session.

4.4.2 abort-loss-measurement

   RPC allow aborting of currently running or scheduled loss measurement
   session.

4.4.3 create-delay-measurement

   RPC allow scheduling of one-way or two-way on-demand or proactive
   performance monitoring delay measurement session.

4.4.4 abort-delay-measurement RPC allow aborting of currently running or
   scheduled delay measurement session.

4. TRILL PM data hierarchy The complete data hierarchy related to the
   OAM YANG is presented below. The following notations are used within
   the tree and carry the meaning as noted below. Each node is printed
   as:

     <status> <flags> <name> <opts> <type>

     <status> is one of:
          +  for current
          x  for deprecated
          o  for obsolete

        <flags> is one of:

          rw  for configuration data
          ro  for non-configuration data
          -x  for rpcs
          -n  for notifications


        <name> is the name of the node


         If the node is augmented into the tree from another module, its
      name is printed as <prefix>:<name>.


      <opts> is one of:

          ?  for an optional leaf or choice
          !  for a presence container
          *  for a leaf-list or list
          [<keys>] for a list's keys


      <type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists
