Abstract

   The iSCSI protocol, described in [RFC3720], allows for extension
   items to the protocol in the form of Private or Public Extension
   Keys.  This Internet-Draft describes a Public Extension Key for
   the purpose of enhancing iSCSI supportability.  The key
   accomplishes this objective by allowing iSCSI nodes to
   communicate architecture details during the iSCSI login
   sequence.  The receiving node can then use this information
   for enhanced logging and support.

1.  Introduction

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2  Overview

   This Internet-Draft describes a declarative Public Extension
   Key as defined by section 12.22 of [RFC3720] that may be used to
   communicate additional iSCSI node information to the opposite
   node in a session.  The information carried in the described
   key has been found to be valuable in real iSCSI customer
   environments as initiator and target vendors collaborate to
   resolve technical issues and better understand the evolving
   iSCSI market.

   The key has been modeled after the "Server" and "User-Agent"
   header fields as specified in sections 14.38 and 14.43 of
   [RFC2616], with the text-value(s) of the key roughly equivalent
   to Product Tokens in section 3.8 of [RFC2616].  Note however
   that the text-value(s) in the keys list-of-values MUST conform
   to the Text Format as specified in section 5.1 of [RFC3720].

   The following described Public Extension Key is sent during
   the login phase of an iSCSI normal session.  It is important
   to note that the intended use of this key is to provide enhanced
   logging and support capabilities, and to enable collection of
   iSCSI implementation usage information.  Functional behavior
   of the iSCSI node MUST NOT depend on the presence, absence, or
   content of the key.  The key MUST NOT be used by iSCSI nodes
   for things such as interoperability, performance, or exclusion or
   deception of other nodes.  To enforce intended use, iSCSI nodes
   MUST NOT allow user modification of the key value(s), and SHOULD
   set the value automatically based on standard internal
   interfaces.

2.  Definition

   The definition of extension the key is as follows, with example
   list-of-values conforming to section 5.1 of [RFC3720].

X#NodeArchitecture

   Use: LO, Declarative
   Senders: Initiator and Target
   Scope: SW

   X#NodeArchitecture=<list-of-values>

   Examples:

      X#NodeArchitecture="Microsoft Software Initiator/1.05a,
                          Microsoft Windows/2003Build1489,
                          Microsoft Cluster Services/2.0,
                          CPU Architecture/x86_64"
      X#NodeArchitecture="Qlogic iSCSI 4010 Hardware Initiator/rev1,
                          Qlogic Firmware/2.0.0.5,
                          Qlogic Driver/2.0.0.1"
      X#NodeArchitecture="Linux iSCSI Software Initiator/4:0.1.11-3,
                          Red Hat Enterprise Linux/4u3,
                          Linux Kernel/2.6.9-34.26.ELsmp,
                          CPU Architecture/i686,
                          CPU Speed/3.06GHz,
                          Memory Size/4059364kB"
      X#NodeArchitecture="NetApp Software Target/7.1,
                          Data ONTAP/7.1,
                          NetApp FAS/270c"

   The initiator or target declares the details of its iSCSI node
   architecture to the remote endpoint.  These details may include,
   but are not limited to, iSCSI vendor software, firmware, or
   hardware versions, the OS version, or hardware architecture.

   X#NodeArchitecture MUST NOT be redeclared.

3.  Security Considerations 

    This extension key transmits specific implementation details
    about the node that sends it; such details may be considered
    sensitive in some environments.  For example, if a certain
    software or firmware version is known to contain security
    weaknesses, announcing the presence of that version via this
    key may not be desirable.  The countermeasures for this
    security concern are:
        - sending less detailed information in the key values, or
        - not sending the extension key, or
        - using IPsec to provide confidentiality for the iSCSI
          connection on which the key is sent (see [RFC3720]
          and [RFC3723]).
    To support the first and second countermeasures, all
    implementations of this extension key SHOULD provide an 
    administrative mechanism to configure different levels of
    detail in the extension key values and MUST provide an
    administrative mechanism to disable sending the key.

    The choice of which countermeasure is most appropriate depends
    on the environment.  However, the second countermeasure may be
    acceptable in many environments, since it provides a compromise
    between sending too much information and the other more
    complete countermeasures of not sending the key at all or using
    IPsec.
