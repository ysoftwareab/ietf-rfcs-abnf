1.  Introduction

   With the development of Internet+, the convergence trend of cloud and
   network is increasingly obvious.  More and more services and
   applications will be carried on the cloud data centers.  In order to
   support new services and applications requirements and meet the
   security requirements for data not going out of the park, therefore
   the deployment location of the cloud/data center is also lowered from
   the original regional DC and core DC to the edge DC.

   As the interconnection network between the regional DC and the core
   DC, the cloud transport network is usually a backbone network.
   However, with the deployment of the edge DC, in order to avoid new
   construction of a huge cloud transport network, the existing metro
   network is used to access the edge DC.  The interconnection between
   edge DCs and regional DC/core DCs is implemented through the
   coordination between the metro and cloud transport network.
   Therefore, the interconnection solution between the cloud transport
   and metro network needs to be considered.

   In addition, the access point of enterprises entering the cloud is
   usually in the metro network, and the dedicated line entering the
   cloud also involves the interconnection between the cloud transport
   and metro network.

   This document describes cloud-network integration scenario and
   networking technologies.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   cloud transport network: It is usually a national or province
   backbone network to achieve interconnection between multiple regional
   clouds/core clouds deployed in the country/province.

3.  Interworking scenarios

   This section defines two interworking scenarios.

3.1.  Multiple domains with common border nodes

   In this scenario, the boundary node of the cloud transport network
   serves as the boundary node of the metro network.  As shown in the
   figure below.  Node 4 serves as the boundary node of the metro
   network as well as the boundary node of the cloud transport network.

              +---------| 2 |--------+--------| 5 | --------+
              |         +---+        |        +---+         |

            +----+    Metro        +---+      cloud       +---+
            | 1  |                 | 4 |     transport    | 7 |
            +----+                 +---+                  +---+

              +---------| 3 |--------+--------| 6 |---------+
                        +---+                 +---+

                                  Figure 1

   The following applies to the reference topology above:

   *  Independent IGP instance in metro region.

   *  Independent IGP instance in cloud transport region.

   *  If the scale of the metro network is large, sometimes it may reach
      thousands or even tens of thousands of nodes.  At this time, the
      metro network will be divided into multiple IGPs.

   *  The cloud transport and metro network can have different
      controllers or under the same controller.

3.2.  Multiple domains with no common border nodes

   In this scenario, the cloud transport network and the metro network
   do not have a common border nodes, and the border node of the two
   networks are connected by a direct link.  As shown below.


                  +---+                             +---+
        +---------| 2 |--------+           +--------| 6 | --------+
        |         +---+        |           |        +---+         |
        |                      |           |                      |
        |                      |           |                      |
      +----+    Metro        +---+       +---+      cloud       +---+
      | 1  |                 | 4 |------ | 5 |     transport    | 8 |
      +----+                 +---+       +---+                  +---+
        |                      |           |                      |
        |                      |           |                      |
        |         +---+        |           |         +---+        |
        +---------| 3 |--------+           +---------| 7 |--------+
                  +---+                              +---+

                                  Figure 2

   In the interworking scenario described in Section 3.1, since two
   domains have the same domain boundary node, so the route mutual
   import can be used by the border node to interconnect the two
   domains.  In this section, the EBGP needs to be deployed between the
   domains to connect the routes of the two domains.

   In this scenario, hierarchical controller architecture usually be
   considered, that is, the cloud transport and metro network have an
   independent controller, and cross-domain controllers are used to
   achieve the coordination of the two domains.  If two domains need to
   be under the same controller, higher requirements are required, such
   as the controller needs to support a standardized unified southbound
   interface and so on.

4.  Networking Technologies

   This section defines three networking technologies.

4.1.  Metro network does not support SRv6

   Based on existing networks, typically, the metro network does not
   support the SRv6 and does not have the ability to upgrade to support
   SRv6.  For example, the earlier deployed metro network supports
   LDP/RSVP/MPLS-TP and traditional L2VPN or L3VPN services.  However,
   the recently deployed metro network may support SR-MPLS/SR-TP, but it
   still cannot support SRv6 due to its hardware capability.

   In this scenario, segment splicing of different network technologies
   is mainly used to achieve end-to-end connection of services.

4.2.  Some nodes of the metro network support SRv6

   In some cases, the metro network devicee connected to the edge DC
   will be upgraded or replaced to support SRv6, while the rest of the
   devices should be kept as old as possible and not replaced, so as to
   avoid the need for more cost investment or avoid affecting the
   existing services of the metro network.

   As shown in Figure 1 or Figure 2, node 4 in metro network is upgraded
   to support SRv6, while the remaining nodes in metro network do not
   support SRv6.Cloud transport network supports SRv6.  In this
   scenario, SRv6 is used for end-to-end service connection.  The main
   consideration is how end-to-end SRv6 traverse non-SRv6 networks.

   Take figure 1 as an example, the metro network supports SR-MPLS, and
   Cloud transport network supports SRv6.
   [I-D.agrawal-spring-srv6-mpls-interworking] can be used to achieve
   interworking.  In other interworking scenarios, or other metro
   network scenarios (such as metro networks support LDP/RSVP/MPLS-TP/
   SR-TP, etc.), the solution needs further discussion.

4.3.  Metro network support SRv6

   The metro network is a new network that supports SRv6, or a recently
   deployed network that has the ability to support SRv6 after an
   upgrade.  Therefore, the metro network and cloud transport network
   are the interworking of two SRv6 domains.  In this case, Solutions
   for interworking between two SRv6 domains need to be considered,
   including the centralized controller and the distributed control
   plane solution, and how to implement end-to-end traffic engineering.
