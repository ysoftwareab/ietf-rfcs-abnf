      The Universal IPv6 Router Advertisement Option (experiment)
                draft-troan-6man-universal-ra-option-01

Abstract

   One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration, was
   to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use
   service discovery for other configuration information.  Unfortunately
   that hasn't panned out quite as planned, and we are in a situation
   where all kinds of configuration options are added to RAs and DHCP.
   This document proposes a new universal RA option in a self-describing
   data format, with the list of elements maintained in an IANA
   registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a new universal option for the Router
   Advertisement IPv6 ND message [RFC4861].  It's purpose is to use the
   RA as an opaque carrier for configuration information between an
   agent on a router and host / host application.

   DHCP is suited to give per-client configuration information, while
   the RA mechanism advertises configuration information to all hosts on
   the link.  There is a long running history of "conflict" between the
   two.  The arguments go; there is less fate-sharing in DHCP, DHCP
   doesn't deal with multiple sources of information, or make it more
   difficult to change information independent of the lifetimes, RA
   cannot be used to configure different information to different
   clients and son on.  And of course some options are only available in
   RAs and some options are only available in DHCP.

   While this proposal does not resolve the DHCP vs RA debate, it
   proposes an experimental solution to the problem of a very slow
   process of standardizing new options, and the IETF spending an
   inordinate amount of time arguing over new configuration options.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Experiment

   This document specifies a new "self-describing" universal RA option.
   Currently new configuration option requires "standards action".  The
   purpose of the experiment is two-fold.  What is the implications of
   an opaque RA option that should not require any code changes for new
   elements within the option?  And what happens when change control is
   relaxed?  The proposal is that no IETF document is required.  The
   configuration option is described directly in the universal RA IANA
   registry.  The other part of the experiment is to

   Duration of experiment: 2 years.

   How to evaluate success?  How many new options have been defined.
   Did expert review suffice to stop "harmful" options?  Was any of the
   options implemented and deployed?  On a successful experiment, the

   time limit of the registry will be removed and it's experimental
   status will be removed.  If the experiment is deamed a failure, then
   the registry will be removed.

4.  The Universal RA option

   The option data is described using the schema language CDDL
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl], with the limitation described in appendix E
   "Use with JSON" and encoded in CBOR [RFC7049].  The restriction is
   there to ensure an easy representation in JSON [RFC8259].

                                 Figure 2

   The universal RA option MUST be small enough to fit within a single
   RA packet.  It then follows that a single JSON object can not be
   larger than what fits within a single option.  Different JSON objects
   can be split across multiple universal RA options (in separate RA
   packets).

   All IANA registered elements are under the "ietf" JSON object.
   Private configuration information can be included in the option using
   different keys.

5.  Implementation Guidance

   The purpose of this option is to allow users to use the RA as an
   opaque carrier for configuration information without requiring code
   changes.

   On the router side there should be an API allowing a user to add a
   JSON object or a pre-encoded CBOR string to RAs sent on a given
   interface.

   On the host side, an API should be available allowing applications to
   subscribe to received RA elements, based on a JSON dictionary key.
   Note, the host side must be able to decode the CBOR into a JSON
   representation.

6.  Security Considerations

   Unless there is a secutity relationship between the host and the
   router (e.g.  SEND), and even then, the consumer of configuration
   information can put no trust in the information received.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new registry for the Universal RA option.
   The registry should be named "IPv6 ND RA Universal option
   (experimental)".  Changes and additions to the registry require
   expert review [RFC8126].

   The schema field follows the CDDL schema definition in
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl].

   The IANA is requested to add the universal option to the "IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" registry with the value of 42.

7.1.  Initial objects in the registry

   The PVD [I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains] elements (and PIO,
   RIO [RFC4191]) are included to provide an alternative representation
   for the proposed new options in that draft.
