     Abstract 

        We describe an experimental framework for constructing SAM sessions 
        using hybrid combinations of Application Layer Multicast, native 
        multicast, and multicast tunnels.  We leverage AMT [THA2006] relay 
        and gateway elements for interoperation between native regions and

        ALM regions.  The framework allows different overlay algorithms and

     1. Introduction 

        The concept of scalable adaptive multicast [BUF2007] includes both 
        scaling properties and adaptability properties.  Scalability is 
        intended to cover: 
        o  large group size 

        o  large numbers of small groups 

        o  rate of group membership change 

        o  admission control for QoS

        o  use with network layer QoS mechanisms 

        o  varying degrees of reliability 

        o  trees connect nodes over global internet 

        Adaptability includes 
        o  use of different control mechanisms for different multicast trees 
           depending on initial application parameters or application class 

        o  changing multicast tree structure depending on changes in 
           application requirements, network conditions, and membership 

        o  use of different control mechanisms and tree structure in 
           different regions of network depending on native multicast 
           support, network characteristics, and node behavior 

        In this document we describe an experimental framework for 
        constructing SAM sessions using hybrid combinations of Application 
        Layer Multicast, native multicast, and multicast tunnels.

        Overlay network – An application layer virtual or logical network in 
        which end points are addressable and that provides connectivity, 
        routing, and messaging between end points. Overlay networks are 
        frequently used as a substrate for deploying new network services, or 
        for providing a routing topology not available from the underlying 
        physical network.  Many peer-to-peer systems are overlay networks 
        that run on top of the Internet. 
        In the above figure, P=Peers, and peers are connected in a logical 
        address space.

     2.2. Overlay Multicast 

        Overlay Multicast (OM): Hosts participating in a multicast session 
        form an overlay network and only utilize unicast among pairs of hosts 
        for data dissemination. The hosts in overlay multicast exclusively 
        handle group management, routing, and tree construction, without any 
        support from Internet routers. This is also commonly known as 
        Application Layer Multicast (ALM) or End System Multicast (ESM). 
        We call systems which use proxies connected in an overlay multicast 
        backbone “proxied overlay multicast” or POM. 
     3. Overlay Assumptions 

        Peers connect in a large-scale overlay, which may be used for a 
        variety of peer-to-peer applications in addition to multicast 
        sessions.  

        We assume a single structured overlay routing algorithm is used.  Any 
        of a variety of multi-hop, one-hop, or variable-hop overlay 
        algorithms could be used. 

        Castro et al. [CAS2003] compared multi-hop overlays and found that 
        tree-based construction in a single overlay out-performed using 
        separate overlays for each multicast session.  We use a single 
        overlay rather than separate overlays per multicast sessions.  We 
        defer federated and hierarchical multi-overlay designs to later 
        analysis. 
        Peers may be distributed throughout the network, in regions where 
        native multicast (NM) is available as well as regions where it is not 
        available. 
        Peers are able to determine, through configuration or discovery: 
        o  Can they connect to a NM router 

        o  Is an AMT gateway accessible 

        o  Can the peer support the AMT-GW functionality locally 

     4. ALM Tree Operations 

        Peers use the overlay to support ALM operations such as: 

        o  Create tree 

        o  Join

        o  Leave 

        o  Re-Form tree 

        There are a variety of algorithms for peers to form multicast trees 
        in the overlay.  We permit multiple such algorithms to be supported 
        in the overlay, since different algorithms may be more suitable for 
        certain application requirements, and since we wish to support 
        experimentation.  Overlay messaging corresponding to the set of 
        overlay multicast operations should carry algorithm identification 
        information. 
        In addition to these overlay level tree operations, some peers may 
        implement additional operations to map tree operations to native 
        multicast and/or AMT [THA2006] connections. 
     5. Hybrid Connectivity 

        In the following figure we show the hybrid architecture in five 
        regions of the network. 
        o  No native multicast:  Peers (P) in this region connect to the 
           overlay 

        o  Native multicast (NM) with a local AMT gateway (AMT GW).  There 
           are one or more peers (P) connected to the overlay in this region. 

        o  Native multicast with a local AMT relay (AMT RLY).  There are one 
           or more peers (P) connected to the overlay in this region. 

        o  Native multicast with one or more peers which emulate the AMT 
           relay behavior (P-AMT-R) which also connect to the overlay.  There 
           may be other peers (P) which also connect to the overlay. 

        o  Native multicast with no peers that connect to the overlay, but 
           for which there is at least one peer in the unicast-only part of 
           the network which can behave as an AMT-GW (P-AMT-GW) to connect to 
           multicast sources through an AMT-R for that region.  It may be 
           feasible to also allow non-peer hosts in such a region to 
           participate as receivers of overlay multicast; for this version, 
           we prefer to require all hosts to join the overlay as peers.

     6. Scenarios 

        The next version of this document will elaborate: 

        o  Native region peer joins existing ALM tree 

        o  ALM peer joins existing Native Mcast, including: NM has AMT Relay 
           ad NM does not have AMT Relay 

     7. Open Issues and Further Work 

        o  AMT [THA2006] has some restrictions on cases where sources and 
           receivers can be located in the gateway-relay connections.  
           Further analysis is needed to insure that OM data path is 
           consistent with these constraints

     Internet-Draft          SAM Problem Statement          January 14, 2007 
         

        o  For NM regions with no AMT support, specifics of how peers self-
           select as P-AMT-GW and P-AMT-RLY, and what additional behavior if 
           any is needed beyond that specified in [THA2006]. 

        o  We expect that the evolution of this document will lead to 
           protocol specification related to the interopation points of the 
           hybrid interfaces of the network. 

     8. Security Considerations 

        Overlays are vulnerable to DOS and collusion attacks.  We are not 
        solving overlay security issues. 
        For this version we assume centralized peer authentication model 
        similar to what is proposed for P2P-SIP.
