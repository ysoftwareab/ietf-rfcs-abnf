                 Mapping characters for PRECIS classes
                     draft-ietf-precis-mappings-06

Abstract

   The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized
   strings ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation
   and comparison.  Case mapping is defined because many protocols
   perform case-sensitive or case-insensitive string comparison and so
   preparation of the string is mandatory.  The Internationalized Domain
   Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement
   describes mappings for internationalized strings that are not limited
   to case, but include width mapping and mapping of delimiters and
   other specials that can be taken into consideration.  This document
   provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS
   framework and describes several mappings that can be applied between
   receiving user input and passing permitted code points to
   internationalized protocols.  The mappings described here are
   expected to be applied as an additional mapping in the PRECIS
   framework.

1.  Introduction

   In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is generated
   through the use of an input method editor ("IME") or through copy-
   and-paste from free text.  Users generally do not care about the case
   and/or width of input characters because they consider those



YONEYA & Nemoto           Expires July 28, 2014                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft               precis mapping                 January 2014


   characters to be functionally equivalent or visually identical.
   Furthermore, users rarely switch the IME state to input special
   characters such as protocol elements.  For Internationalized Domain
   Names ("IDNs"), the IDNA Mapping specification [RFC5895] describes
   methods for handling these issues.  For PRECIS strings, case mapping
   and width mapping are defined in the PRECIS framework specification
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].  Further, the handling of mappings other
   than case and width, such as delimiter, special, and local case, are
   also important in order to increase the probability that strings
   match as users expect.  This document provides guidelines for authors
   of protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes mappings
   that can be applied between receiving user input and passing
   permitted code points to internationalized protocols.  The mappings
   described in this document are expected to be applied as additional
   mapping in the PRECIS framework.

2.  Protocol dependent mappings

   The PRECIS framework defines several protocol-independent mappings.
   The additional mappings defined in this document are protocol-
   dependent, i.e., they depend on the rules for a particular
   application protocol.

2.1.  Delimiter mapping

   Some application protocols define delimiters for their own use,
   resulting in the fact that the delimiters are different for each
   protocol.  The delimiter mapping table should therefore be based on a
   well-defined mapping table for each protocol.

   Delimiter mapping is used to map characters that are similar to
   protocol delimiters into the canonical delimiter characters.  For
   example, there are width-compatible characters that correspond to the
   '@' in email addresses and the ':' and '/' in URIs.  The '+', '-',
   '<' and '>' characters are other common delimiters that might require
   such mapping.  For the FULL STOP character (U+002E), a delimiter in
   the visual presentation of domain names, some IMEs produce a
   character such as IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+3002) when a user types
   FULL STOP on the keyboard.  In all these cases, the visually similar
   characters that can come from user input need to be mapped to the
   correct protocol delimiter characters before the string is passed to
   the protocol.

2.2.  Special mapping

   Aside from delimiter characters, certain protocols have characters
   which need to be mapped in ways that are different from the rules
   specified in the PRECIS framework (e.g., mapping non-ASCII space



YONEYA & Nemoto           Expires July 28, 2014                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               precis mapping                 January 2014


   characters to ASCII space).  In this document, these mappings are
   called "special mappings".  They are different for each protocol.
   Therefore, the special mapping table should be based on a well-
   defined mapping table for each protocol.  Examples of special mapping
   are the following;

   o  White spaces are mapped to SPACE (U+0020)

   o  Some characters such as control characters are mapped to nothing
      (Deletion)

   As examples, EAP [RFC3748], SASLprep [RFC4013], IMAP4 ACL [RFC4314]
   and LDAPprep [RFC4518] define the rule that some codepoints for the
   non-ASCII space are mapped to SPACE (U+0020).

2.3.  Local case mapping

   The purpose of local case mapping is to increase the probability of a
   matching result from the comparison between uppercase and lowercase
   characters, targeting characters which mapping depends on locale or
   locale and context.

   As an example of locale and context-dependent mapping, LATIN CAPITAL
   LETTER I ("I", U+0049) is normally mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER I
   ("i", U+0069); however, if the case of Turkish (or one of several
   other languages), unless an I is before a dot_above, the character
   should be mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).

   Case mapping in PRECIS framework does not consider such locale or
   context because it is a common framework for internationalization.
   Local case mapping defined in this document corresponds to demands
   from applications which supports users' locale and/or context.  The
   target characters of local case mapping are characters defined in the
   SpecialCasing.txt [Specialcasing] file in section 3.13 of the Unicode
   Standard [Unicode].

   If a codepoint is a target, the case folding method for the codepoint
   is mapping into lower case as defined in SpecialCasing.txt.  On the
   other hand, if a codepoint is not a target, the case folding method
   for the codepoint is the same with case mapping in PRECIS framework.
   This local case mapping provides alternative case folding method to
   case mapping in the PRECIS framework, therefore if a PRECIS profile
   chooses local case mapping, it should not choose case mapping.  The
   reason for this is written in the Appendix B.

3.  Order of operations

   The mappings described in this document are expected to be applied as
   additional mappings in the PRECIS framework.  The mappings described
   in this document describes could be applied in any order.  This
   section specifies a particular order to minimize the effect of
   codepoint changes introduced by the mappings.  This mapping order is
   very general and has been designed to be acceptable to the widest
   user community.

   1.  Delimiter mapping

   2.  Special mapping

   3.  Local case mapping

4.  Open issues

   This verstion(-06) changed the definition of local case mapping.
   There were comments in IETF88 stating that there are cases in which
   GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2) (hereinafter referred to as
   "final sigma") and LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF) (hereinafter
   referred to as "eszett") are mapped into characters that are not
   intended by the users, and this is undesirable.  Until the last
   version(-05), selecting local case mapping followed by case mapping
   in the PRECIS framework was allowed.  Taking the above mentioned
   comments into consideration, this version(-06) defines local case
   mapping as alternative to case mapping in the PRECIS framework.  For
   this reason, eszett is no longer mapped to another characters.  But
   this is inapplicable to final sigma as the context dependent mapping
   does not exist in the table and definition of the SpecialCasing.txt.
   (Followings are comments in SpecialCasing.txt.)

      # Note: the following cases are not included, since they would
      case-fold in lowercasing
      # 03C3; 03C2; 03A3; 03A3; Final_Sigma; # GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA
      # 03C2; 03C3; 03A3; 03A3; Not_Final_Sigma; # GREEK SMALL LETTER

   We have come up with 2 ways to solve this issue.  However, the
   decision of which of them should be taken is an open issue.

   1.  Define extra mapping table inside this document.

   2.  Leave the solution for final sigma issue to Unicode's definition,
       and mark this issue as "not supported" in the appendix section of
       this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   As well as Mapping Characters for IDNA2008 [RFC5895], this document
   suggests creating mappings that might cause confusion for some users
   while alleviating confusion in other users.  Such confusion is not
   covered in any depth in this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.

7.  Acknowledgment

   Martin Duerst suggested a need for the case folding about the mapping
   (map final sigma to sigma, German sz to ss,.).

   Alexey Melnikov, Andrew Sullivan, Barry Leiba, Heather Flanagan, Joe
   Hildebrand, John Klensin, Marc Blanchet, Pete Resnick and Peter
   Saint-Andre, et al. gave important suggestion for this document
   during at WG meeting and WG LC.

Appendix B.  Local case mapping vs Case mapping

   One outstanding issue regarding full case folding for characters is,
   the character "LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S" (U+00DF) (hereinafter
   referred to as "eszett") becomes two "LATIN SMALL LETTER S"s (U+0073
   U+0073) by performing the case mapping in the PRECIS framework.  If
   local case mapping in this document is not an alternative to case
   mapping in PRECIS framework, PRECIS profile designers can select both
   mappings, therefore, German's eszett can not keep the locale if the
   case mapping in the PRECIS framework was performed after the local
   case mapping.
