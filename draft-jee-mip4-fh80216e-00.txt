Internet-Draft      FMIPv4 for IEEE 802.16e networks      September 2005


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv4 protocol [RFC3344] is currently available in order to
   provide sessions continuity for mobile nodes.  Though this Mobile
   IPv4 is capable of handling IPv4 handovers between different subnets,
   in a transparent way for higher-level connections, it is not adequate
   in supporting real time application that requires low latency and
   packet loss.  Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv4 [I-D.koodli-fmipv4]
   provides a mechanism to reduce latency and packet loss resulting from
   Mobile IPv4 handover operations to solve the performance problem of
   Mobile IPv4 in wireless mobile environments.  Fast Handovers for
   Mobile IPv4 addresses movement detection, IP address configuration
   and location update latencies to meet the real time application
   requirements.

   This document gives a set of deployment examples for Mobile IPv4 Fast
   Handovers on 802.16e networks.  As modeled on the [I-D.jang-mipshop-
   fh80216e], we begin with a brief overview of relevant aspects of
   basic 802.16e.  We examine how and when 802.16e's handover related
   information might become available to the IP layers that implement
   Fast Handover, both in the network infrastructure and on the mobile
   node.  Finally, we trace the protocol steps for Mobile IPv4 Fast
   Handover in this environment.

   802.16e standard [IEEE802.16e] is only used in this document as a
   reference model since 802.16 standard is for fixed broadband wireless
   access systems, but no restriction is made by this document.


2.  Terminology

   This document borrows all of the terminology from [RFC3344] and
   [I-D.koodli-fmipv4], with the following additional terms from the
   802.16e specification:

   MOB_NBR-ADV : IEEE 802.16e neighbor advertisement message sent
   periodically by a BS(Base Station).

   MOB_MSHO-REQ : IEEE 802.16e handover initiation request message sent
   by a MS(Mobile Station).

   MOB_BSHO-RSP : IEEE 802.16e handover initiation response message sent
   by a BS.

   MOB_BSHO-REQ : IEEE 802.16e handover initiation request message sent
   by a BS.

   MOB_HO-IND : IEEE 802.16e handover indication message sent by a MS.

   BSID : IEEE 802.16e BS identifier.


3.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Deployment Architectures for Mobile IPv4 on 802.16e

   The relationship between BSs(Base Stations), ARs(Access Routers) and
   IP subnets is almost the same as the case of Mobile IPv6 which is
   described in [I-D.jang-mipshop-fh80216e] except the existence of
   FA(Foreign Agent) which may be co-located with AR.  We only provide
   figures for convenience.

5.  802.16e Handovers in Detail

   The 802.16e provides three handover modes, hard handover, fast BS
   switching and soft handover in IEEE 802.16e [].  In this version of
   the draft, we first consider the hard handover mode because this is
   the default mode in 802.16e.

   An 802.16e handover provides the MS initiated handover and network
   initiated handover according to which entity initiates the L2
   handover in this network.  Even though the MS or network entity can
   initiate the L2 handover, the MS ultimately decides its target BS
   with its own criteria.  When MS does not want to choose one of BSs
   which are suggested by the serving BS, MS can re-initiate L2 handover

Internet-Draft      FMIPv4 for IEEE 802.16e networks      September 2005


   from its side.

   The L2 handover process in 802.16e networks consist of the following
   steps:

   1.  MS acquires network topology information and channel information
   for neighbor BSs by receiving MOB_NBR-ADV message which is
   periodically broadcasted by the serving BS.

   2.  MS may perform scanning/association with the neighbor BSs, and
   sends radio measurement reports to the serving BS.

   3. 3.  MS initiates handoff preparation by sending MOB_MSHO-REQ
   message to the serving BS and the BS replies with MOB_BSHO-RSP
   message containing the recommended target BSs.  In case the serving
   BS sends MOB_BSHO-REQ to initiate handoff preparation, the
   recommended target BSs are included in MOB_BSHO-REQ message.

   4.  MS decides the target BS from the suggested BSs in MOB_BSHO-RSP
   or MOB_BSHO-REQ by performing the BS decision algorithm.

   5.  MS sends MOB_HO-IND to the serving BS to commit a L2 handover.

   6.  MS shall synchronize to downlink transmissions of target BS, and
   obtain DL and UL transmission parameters only if it did not receive
   MOB-NBR-ADV message from the serving BS.

   7.  MS shall conduct network re-entry procedure with the target BS.
   Network re-entry procedure is the same as the initial network entry
   except that it may be shortened by the possession of the MS
   information obtained from the serving BS over the backbone network.

   8.  MS completes the L2 handover by receiving the REG-RSP from the
   target BS.

   When a MS sends a MOB_HO-IND to the serving BS, any packet data
   transfer between the MN and the serving BS is not possible even
   though the resource retain timer does not expire in the serving BS.
   Therefore, MS SHOULD send a FBU message to the serving BS before
   sending the MOB_HO-IND to the serving BS to operate as the predictive
   mode.

   One possible way to operate as the predictive mode is to use the
   association information during the scanning procedure, which
   optionally supports the association procedure with neighbor BSs.
   This can increase the probability for the FMIPv6 predictive mode can
   happen.  However, performing the association during the scanning
   interval is an optional feature.

6.  FMIPv4 Message Exchanges

   An FMIPv4 handover normally consists of the following messages:

   a.  MN sends an RtSolPr (Router Solicitation for Proxy) to find out
   about neighboring ARs.

   b.  MN receives a PrRtAdv (Proxy Router Advertisement) containing one
   or more [BS-ID, AR-Info] tuples.

   c.  MN sends a FBU (Fast Binding Update) to PAR (Previous Access
   Router).

   d.  PAR sends a HI (Handover Initiate) to NAR (New Access Router).

   e.  NAR sends a HAck (Handover Acknowledge) to PAR.  The HAck
   contains an NCoA that NAR assigns.

   f.  PAR sends an FBAck (Fast Binding Acknowledgment) to MN.

   g.  MN (re)sends FBU to NAR after attaching to it.

   In case of reactive handover, MN connects to NAR prior to sending FBU
   to PAR in the previous link.  After step g, NAR forwards FBU to PAR
   then steps d, e and f would take place from there.


7.  Scenarios

   In this section, we look at a few of the possible scenarios for using
   FMIPv4 in an 802.16e context.  We label each scenario by the sequence
   of events that take place, where the numbered events are from Section
   5 and the lettered events are from Section 6.

   We describe a brief description and discussion of the benefits and
   drawbacks for each scenario.

   Figure 4: Predictive mode in 802.16e

   This scenario is the predictive mode of operation from the FMIPv4
   specification.  In this scenario, MN's actual L2 handover commitment
   of sending MOB_HO-IND SHOULD happen only after sending FBU to PAR as
   shown in Figure 4: Predictive mode in 802.16e.  This mode of
   operation requires that the decision of a target BS and handover
   commit operations (steps 4 and 5) happen separately and under MN
   control, so that step c can intervene between steps 4 and 5.  Steps
   d, e, and f may operate simultaneously or lately with steps 6, 7, and
   8.  The most important point to operate as the predictive mode is to
   send FBU prior to sending MOB_HO-IND to the serving BS because MS's
   sending MOB_HO-IND to the serving BS results in disabling

   transferring any L3 packet between the MN and PAR.

   Steps a and b may happen after steps 3 to acquire fresh triplet
   information of NARs.  In this case, MN expects to get only the NARs
   information that is related with the candidate target BSs.

   Step a may be omitted in case where PAR has a capability of actively
   sending PrRtAdv with the NARs information related with the suggested
   BSs list in MOB_BSHO-RSP or MOB_BSHO-REQ.  This case requires the
   serving BS to notify the suggested BSs information to the PAR.

   Figure 5: Reactive mode in 802.16e

   This scenario is the reactive mode from the FMIPv4 specification.

   This scenario does not require MN's intervention between steps 4 and
   5 as shown in Figure 5: Reactive mode in 802.16e.

   Minimum requirement is to get an NAR's L2 information through steps a
   and b from the serving BS.  Therefore, steps a and b SHOULD happen
   before the step 5.

   Figure 6: Optimized Reactive mode in 802.16e

   This scenario is an optimized mechanism of the FMIPv4's reactive
   mode.  The tunnel set-up between PAR and NAR is actively initiated at
   PAR without FBU from MN only using HI and HAck as shown in Figure 6:
   Optimized Reactive mode in 802.16e.



Jee, et al.              Expires March 16, 2006                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      FMIPv4 for IEEE 802.16e networks      September 2005


   When serving BS receives the MOB_HO_IND which contains the target BS
   information, it requests PAR to send HI message to NAR which serves
   the target BS.  Basically, PAR is assumed to have the co-relation
   information between the target BS and NAR.  This optimized mode has a
   benefit of reducing the packet forwarding delay from PAR to MN in the
   reactive mode.  When MN sends FBU to NAR after attaching to the new
   access network, NAR just delivers the buffered packet to MN.

   Steps a and b may not require but helps MN to recognize the
   neighboring NARs' information in advance of handover.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration of the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv4
   specification [I-D.koodli-fmipv4] are also applicable to this
   document.  Particularly, 802.16e architecture supports a number of
   mandatory authorization mechanisms, for example, EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM
   and EAP-AKA, as well as, protects IP address management between the
   MN and its network entity.  That will allow secure handover operation
   between the MN and network entity.

   We will describe security issues in more detail in the updated
   version of this document.
