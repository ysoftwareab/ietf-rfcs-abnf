Abstract

   In some cases a UA (or proxy) within a Session Initiation Protocol
   [RFC3261] Service Provider (SSP) has multiple parallel egress proxy
   options to reach an ingress proxy within another SSP to reach the
   target UA.  If the originating SSP uses ENUM to identify the ingress
   proxy of the target SSP, there is currently no way for the ENUM NAPTR
   response to identify a specific preferred egress proxy from the set
   of multiple parallel proxies.  This draft solves this problem by
   defining a method for returning deterministic routing information
   within an ENUM NAPTR response enabling the UA (or proxy) to choose a
   preferred egress proxy.  Using this information, the originating UA
   now sends the SIP request through the predetermined preferred egress
   proxy to reach the target SSP's proxy.  This document describes
   several methods to make this determination by incorporating variables
   into a SIP service URI contained in the E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM)
   response.

Internet-Draft        SIP Egress Route Use in ENUM            March 2010


1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, [RFC3761]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers into URIs and then uses DNS [RFC1034] features such as
   delegation through NS records, or the use of Naming Authority Pointer
   (NAPTR) records, to provide the communication services available for
   a specific domain name.  This draft refers to the resulting SIP
   enumservice NAPTR record type received by an ENUM client request.
   Simplified methods for provisioning call routing data in ENUM servers
   have developed a desire among SIP Service Providers (SSPs) to manage
   all call routing data in an ENUM database versus managing some call
   routing in both ENUM and DNS.

   There are three methods defined in this document for specifying an
   egress route.  First, it defines the use of trunk group contexts as
   defined in [RFC4904] as additional parameters in the E2U+SIP
   enumservice NAPTR record [RFC3403] URI.  Second, it defines the use
   of adding a SIP Route header as an additional header in the E2U+SIP
   enumservice NAPTR record URI.  Third, it describes a new enumservice
   type TRUNK.  While all of these options are included, the document
   asserts adding trunk group contexts as the preferred method.  The
   reason this is the preferred method is due to existing production
   implementations.  While this is the case, today, it does not mean
   another method or set of methods may become the preferred option(s)
   in the industry.

   To illustrate the problem further, the following diagram describes a
   scenario where SSP1 has two options to send a request to SSP2.  For
   reasons outside the scope of this draft, SSP1 would prefer to use
   SBE2 to send a request to SSP2.

   Based on the information from SSP2, an example ENUM response for SSP1
   would look something like the following:

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip" "!^.*$!sip:\1@sbe3.ssp2.example.com!" .


   While SSP1 could use a private, customized method (e.g. private DNS)
   to discover and manipulate a preferred call routing path to SBE3, it
   prefers to use an industry defined method in ENUM to specify SBE2 as
   the egress point to reach SBE3.  This document defines multiple
   methods for SSP1 to specify the preferred call routing path to reach
   SBE3 through the results of an ENUM query.

   In all of the following methods, the provisioning of the additional
   information in an ENUM server is outside the scope of this draft;
   however, it should be assumed, the additional information added will
   be used exclusively by the querying SSP.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Additional terms used in this document for describing aspects of the
   problem and solution are defined in RFC 5486 [RFC5486].


3.  Methods for Including Egress Routing Information for SIP in ENUM

3.1.  Using Trunk Group Contexts

   The use of trunk groups is well described in [RFC4904] for IP to PSTN
   gateway scenarios.  In addition to this trunk group usage, more and
   more SIP service providers (SSPs) are defining trunk groups as SIP IP
   network end-points.  This can be thought of as a SIP trunk group.
   While there have been other attempts to define a SIP trunk group, in
   this draft, they are simply referred to as an IPv4/v6 address or a
   fully qualified domain name (FQDN) representing the target SIP UA or
   proxy.  In addition, SIP trunk groups are becoming popular for
   defining an associated egress Signaling Path Border Element (SBE) for
   preferred routing to a peer's ingress SBE.

   In the following example, the additional 'trunk' parameters defined
   in [RFC4904] are included in the SIP URI NAPTR response.  Since, the
   result of the query provides a URI response for the Service field
   'E2U+sip', the client now has all of the information available to it
   to route the call.  The following figure and subsequent explanation
   illustrates this in more detail:

   In the above figure, SSP2 notifies SSP1 to reach +442079460148, send
   your SIP request to ssp2.example.com.  SSP1 decides it prefers to
   send all requests to sbe3@ssp2.example.com via SBE2.  In order to do
   this, it assigns a trunk group to SBE2.  The trunk group, for example
   purposes, is SBE3.  The Trunk Context is ssp2.example.com.  The trunk
   group and context are provisioned into the ENUM server, so when the
   Proxy (in this example, also the ENUM client) queries for
   +442079460148 it receives the following response:

   NOTE: The NAPTR records shown in this section are intended for
   illustration purposes only, and are not intended as good examples of

                                   @sbe2.ssp1.example.com;user=phone!" .

   If SSP1 desires SBE1 to be a fail-over solution to SBE2, then this
   would be an example response:

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1;tgrp=SBE3;
                     trunk-context=sbe3@ssp2.example.com
                                   @sbe2.ssp1.example.com;user=phone!" .
      NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1;tgrp=SBE3;
                     trunk-context=sbe3@ssp2.example.com
                                   @sbe1.ssp1.example.com;user=phone!" .

   Using the example figure, trunk group use is especially applicable if
   SSP2 uses an IPv4/v6 address to specify SBE3 with no additional DNS
   look-ups to discover the preferred path via SBE2.

3.2.  Using the SIP Route Header

   Another method for identifying a preferred egress route could be to
   include the SIP Route header field information as a parameter in ENUM
   query returned E2U+SIP NAPTR.  The following is an example of a
   returned SIP URI NAPTR with the SIP Route header field information
   included in the response:

   NOTE: The NAPTR records shown in this section are intended for
   illustration purposes only, and are not intended as good examples of
   how to do ENUM provisioning.

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1@sbe3.ssp2.example.com;
                             user=phone!?route=sbe1.ssp1.example.com" .
      NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1@sbe3.ssp2.example.com;
                             user=phone!?route=sbe2.ssp1.example.com" .

3.3.  Create a new ENUM Service Type

   One method for identifying a trunk group in ENUM could be to define a
   new service type "trunk".  This new service type would return a tel
   URI containing the "tgrp" and "trunk context" parameters that can
   then be carried in IP signaling to control trunk group selection in
   downstream gateways.  While this new ENUM service type may work in
   production environments, it places an unnecessary burden on ENUM
   clients to either assume a trunk group exists by always initiating a
   second ENUM query for the "trunk" service type, or evaluating the
   entire list of NAPTRs in the response for additional service types,
   potentially beyond what it originally queried for.

   An evaluation of [RFC3402], [RFC3403], and [RFC5483] reveals there is
   no clear definition that says an ENUM client MUST only determine the
   use of one returned NAPTR and ignore any other NAPTRs returned by the
   server.  While this may be true, it can also be argued that an ENUM
   client will only choose one NAPTR (and ignore the rest) after

Internet-Draft        SIP Egress Route Use in ENUM            March 2010


   evaluating the Services field value, along with the ORDER and
   PREFERENCE/PRIORITY values, and assuming the NAPTR identifies an
   acceptable URI that is not rejected by the client due to some other
   circumstance.  Assuming the ENUM client accepts a NAPTR based on this
   criteria, it is possible a client may never evaluate additional
   service field values.

   This is illustrated in the following example of a client querying the
   server for a SIP URI available for the telephone number
   +442079460148.  The example illustrates a potential additional
   service type mechanism, where the trunk group parameters are returned
   in a new ENUM 'trunk' service type.

   NOTE: The NAPTR records shown in this section are intended for
   illustration purposes only, and are not intended as good examples of
   how to do ENUM provisioning.

   The following example illustrates a potential scenario indicating how
   an ENUM client MAY not ever evaluate a NAPTR with the 'trunk' service
   type.

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
     NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1@ssp2.example.com!" .
     NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip"  "!^.*$!sip:\1@ssp2.example.com!" .
     NAPTR 11 100 "u" "E2U+trunk" "!^.*$!trunk:sip\1;tgrp=SBE3;
                     trunk-context=sbe3@ssp2.example.com
                                   @sbe2.ssp1.example.com;user=phone!" .

   In this example, the ENUM client will likely select the first NAPTR,
   because of a match on the queried Services field value, and the ORDER
   and PREFERENCE/PRIORITY value.  It will never evaluate the 'trunk'
   NAPTR unless the previous two fail for some other circumstance.  Even
   if the client does not specify a service in the original query, the
   ENUM client will likely choose one of the first two NAPTRs due to the
   inherent choice based on the clients understanding of the preferred
   service.  In order for the client to choose the 'trunk' NAPTR, it
   would need to either evaluate two NAPTRs in the response based on a
   client configuration to look for both, or it would have to place a
   query specifically for the 'trunk' service regardless of knowing
   whether trunk parameters exist or not.  This is due to the fact the
   client will always have to assume trunk parameters exist as to avoid
   routing failures due to not having the complete information
   associated with the destination SIP URI.

   It is recognized that one potential option is to change the order of
   the service types to process the 'trunk' service type first.  While
   more and more SIP user agents are supporting ENUM clients, they are
   only supporting a subset of ENUM service types (primarily SIP).

   Adding a new service requires two changes to the SIP ENUM client

   o  it needs to support the new URI type (in this case 'trunk:'), and

   o  a new ENUM service type and processing logic.

   Eliminating the new service type in favor of embedding the parameters
   in the SIP URIs now only requires the SIP ENUM client to support the
   URI extensions with no impact to how it processes NAPTR records or
   how it queries the ENUM server.


4.  ENUM Client, Proxy, and User Agent Considerations

   It should not be assumed the originating proxy or user agent (UA),
   acting as the ENUM client, will perform an action based on the
   received trunk group information.  With this in mind, it is
   recommended that if the proxy or UA does not know how to interpret or
   act on the trunk group parameters it should simply forward the URI as
   received from the ENUM server to the next downstream SIP signaling
   element.
