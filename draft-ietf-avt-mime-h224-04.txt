Abstract

   In conversional video applications far end camera control protocol is
   used by participants to control the remote camera.  The protocol that
   is commonly used is ITU H.281 over H.224.  The document registers the
   H224 media type.  It defines the syntax and the semantics of the SDP
   parameters needed to support far end camera control protocol using
   H.224.

1.  Introduction

   The document registers the H224 media type that may be used by
   systems that uses SDP [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-new].

   This media type is used for supporting the simple far end camera
   control protocol on SDP based systems.  The media type helps
   signaling gateways between H.323 [ITU.H323] and SDP based systems to
   use far end camera control, end to end, without having any protocol
   translation in the middle.

   The document defines H224 media type since the RTP packets in H.323
   annex Q [ITU.H323] carry H.224 frames[ITU.H224].  The far end camera
   control protocol (FECC) is internal to H.224 frame and is identified
   by the client ID field of the H.224 packet.

   The document will define the SDP [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-new] parameters
   needed to support the above far end camera control protocol in
   systems that use SDP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119] and

3.  Far-end camera control protocol

   This simple protocol is based on ITU-T H.281[ITU.281] frames carried
   in ITU-T H.224 packets in an RTP/UDP channel.  H.323 annex Q
   specifies how to build the RTP packets from the H.224 packets.

   Using far end camera control protocol in point to point calls and
   multipoint calls for packet switch networks is described in H.323
   annex Q

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Media Type Registration

   This section describes the media types and names associated with this
   payload format.  The registration uses the templates defined in
   RFC4288 [RFC4288].  It follows RFC3555 [RFC3555].

4.1.1.  Registration of MIME media type application/h224

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: H224

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: None

   Encoding considerations:

      This media type is framed (see H.323 Annex Q [ITU.H323]) and
      contains binary data, see section 4.8 in [RFC4288]

   Security considerations: See Section 6 of RFCxxxx

   Interoperability considerations:

      Terminals sending simple far end camera control command should use
      this MIME type, receivers who can not support the protocol will
      reject the channel.

   Published specification: RFC xxxx

   Applications which use this media type:

      Video conferencing applications.

   Additional information: none

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:

      This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
      for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other framing
      protocols is not defined at this time.

5.  SDP Parameters

   The media media type application/h224 string is mapped to fields in
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) as follows:

   o The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be application.  The
   transport SHALL be any applicable RTP profile (for example RFC 3551
   [RFC3551]) and the payload type is dynamic.

   o The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be h224 (the
   MIME subtype).

   o The default clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 4800.

   The recommended maximum bandwidth for this protocol is 6.4 kbit/sec.

5.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model

   When offering FECC using SDP in an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] the
   following considerations are necessary.

   Far end camera control communication are uni-directional.  H.224 is
   bi-directional and can be used to learn the capabilities of the
   remote video end point e.g how many cameras it has.  The offer answer
   exchange is dependent on the functionality of both side.

   The offerer offers a sendonly channel if its camera can not be
   remotely controlled and if the offerer does not intend to use H.224
   to learn the capabilities of the remote video endpoints.

   In all other cases, when the offerer's camera can be remotely
   controlled and/or it intends to use H.224 capabilities negotiation,
   the offerer offers a sendrecv channel.

   The answerer behavior is as follows:

   If it receives an offer with sendonly it answers with a recvonly if
   it supports far end camera control, otherwise it ignores / reject the
   offer.

   If it receives an offer with sendrecv and its camera can be remotely
   controlled it answers with a sendrecv option.  If its camera cannot
   be remotely controlled it rejects the offer but may later try to
   remotely control the offerer's camera using this procedure.

6.  Security Considerations

   H.224 payload format defined in H.323 annex Q defines packets
   structure based on RTP using the RTP header structure from RFC3550.
   Those packets are subject to the security considerations discussed in
   the RTP specification [RFC3550].  This implies that confidentiality
   of the media streams is achieved by encryption.  SRTP [RFC3711] may
   be used to provide both encryption and integrity protection of RTP
   flow.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data that causes
   application behavior like camera movement.  The attacker can inject
   pathological datagrams into the stream which cause the receiver to
   change the camera position.  Therefore, the usage of data origin
   authentication and data integrity protection of at least the H.323
   annex Q packet is RECOMMENDED; for example, with SRTP.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality and
   integrity of H.323 annex Q packets and their payloads is very
   dependent on the application and on the transport and signaling
   protocols employed.  Thus, although SRTP is given as an example
   above, other possible choices exist.
