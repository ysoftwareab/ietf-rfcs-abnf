Abstract

   This document describes extensions to the Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol(SCTP) [RFC2960] and the "Dynamic Address Reconfiguration"
   [draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp].  In this proposal, we propose changes
   to the way ASCONF's are handled and bundled to allow multiple
   ASCONF's to be sent during times of disconnected connectivity.  This
   then allows a method which allows the retransmit of multiple ASCONF

Internet-Draft  SCTP ASCONF chunk transmission extension       June 2006


1.  Introduction

   SCTP is a protocol which supports assigning multiple addresses for
   both ends of an association.  To support the dynamic reconfiguration
   of the addresses for each end, an internet-draft "Dynamic Address
   Reconfiguration (ADD-IP)" [draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp] is proposed.
   By adopting this proposal, each end can reconfigure its addresses one
   by one by sending an "Address Configuration (ASCONF) chunk" and
   receiving an ASCONF-ACK chunk for the receipt of an ASCONF chunk.

   The current ADD-IP draft allows an endpoint of an association to have
   only one outstanding ASCONF chunk at any time.  Before a subsequent
   ASCONF can be sent, the sender of ASCONF must wait to receive an
   ASCONF_ACK.

   Because of this limitation, there are some situations that an
   association may enter in which it will end up causing an association
   failure event or it will take much longer time than expected, even
   though there are available pairs of addresses.  The following are
   typical cases where such an event may occur:

   -  In the case that all addresses lose reachability and transition
      through multiple separate address reconfiguration events requiring
      the sending of multiple ASCONF's over a short period of time.

      This situation may happen when a wireless access, with both IPv4
      and IPv6 addresses, first loses one of its addresses, followed by
      a subsequent address loss, followed by an acquisition of yet a new
      address.  When the interface which these addresses are attached
      goes down, and a lease time of Router Advertisement (RA) or DHCP
      is expired, these addresses become invalid one by one.  As the
      first IP address is not the last remaining IP address, the
      endpoint first tries to send an ASCONF to delete the address.  But
      it fails because no valid source IP address exists and it enters
      to retransmission phase.

      The host cannot send the second ASCONF chunk that may add the new
      addresses because it has not yet received the ASCONF_ACK for the
      first ASCONF.  It takes a long time before the retransmission of
      ASCONF occurs.  Even when it is retransmitted, the ASCONF chunk is
      ignored by the peer if the new address is used as the source IP
      address of the ASCONF chunk, because the new address may not be
      used as source IP address of a chunk except the case that the
      chunk is to add the new address.  Other old addresses might be un-
      reachable, and they should not be used as the source IP address.

      As the result, the association will fail and enter into the CLOSED
      state.

   -  In the case that the newly acquired address is not reachable to
      the peer when there is no valid address in the association.  This
      transition may happen for just a short segment of time and after a
      few moments before connectivity is restored.

      This situation happens when the last remaining valid IP address
      turns unavailable as a host loses its wireless access and get
      another new address but its network is disconnected or under NAT,
      or unable to connect to the peer because of some filters, etc.

      The ADD-IP draft targets to support this type of transition, and
      Address Parameter which indicates one of the IP addresses of the
      association is introduced to look for the association which the
      ASCONF chunk belongs to.  The source IP address of usual SCTP
      packet must be an address of the association.  But on getting a
      new address, the ADD-IP draft allows the end-host to send an
      ASCONF chunk from the new address which is not in the association
      only when one of the IP address of the association is listed in
      Address Parameter, and the source IP address of the packet is the
      address which the ASCONF chunk is going to add.

      When such transition occurs, but the new address is not able to
      send an ASCONF chunk to the peer because its network is
      disconnected or under NAT, or unable to connect to the peer
      because of some filters, etc, the ASCONF chunk is stored in queue
      for retransmission.

      However, if the new address is the only address that the end-host
      has, the retransmission will fail forever and the association will
      enter into the CLOSED state.

      Even though the end-host gets another new address later, the end-
      host cannot use this address for the source address of the ASCONF
      stored in queue because the source IP address must be same to the
      address going to add.

   To postpone sending ASCONF and pre-check whether the new address has
   reachability to the peer may partially solve the second problem.  But
   this strategy will increase handover delay, and of course, there is
   no reliable way of detecting the reachability judging from an IP
   address by itself.

3.  The Cumulative ASCONF chunks

   An Ordinary ASCONF Chunk packet format is as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3

      |                     ASCONF Parameter #1                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      \                                                               \
      /                             ....                              /
      \                                                               \
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                     ASCONF Parameter #N                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   There is a rule that ASCONF chunk MUST NOT be sent out while there is
   an unacknowledged ASCONF chunk which is previously outstanding.

   This document changes those procedures with the following new
   requirements:
   o  The end-host MAY send an ASCONF at any time when new ASCONF is
      created and appended to the unacknowledged ASCONF chunks.  The
      retransmission timer for the previous ASCONF is stopped, and
      another timer is started.
   o  These additional ASCONF chunks MUST be bundled and in strict
      numerically ascending order.
   o  Each chunk added to the packet to be retransmitted MUST assume
      that the processing of the other chunks is successfully done for
      the purposes of specifying the Address Parameter (used for lookup
      of the association).

   The following example illustrates a Cumulative ASCONF packet which
   consists of an ASCONF(Serial: N) with 3 unacknowledged ASCONF chunks
   (Serial: N-3 to N-1):

   These 4 ASCONF chunks MUST be packed together in a message and the
   serial number of these packets MUST be in ascending order as
   illustrated above.

   The format of each ASCONF chunk has not changed from the ADD-IP
   draft.  The ASCONF chunks (Serial N-3 to N-1) MUST not be modified
   and must remain the same as when they were first transmitted.

   When creating the ASCONF chunk for Serial N, the chunk has the same
   format which ADD-IP draft describes.  The only difference is that if
   the Address Parameter is not set to 0, it MUST be one of the IP
   addresses of the association assuming that all of the former ASCONFs
   are applied.

3.1.  ASCONF-ACK for Cumulative ASCONF chunk

   The receiver of Cumulative ASCONF chunk must return an ASCONF-ACK for
   each of the ASCONF chunks in the order received from the Cumulative
   ASCONF packet.

   The packet containing the ASCONF-ACK chunks MUST be returned to the
   source IP address of the sender of Cumulative ASCONF chunk.

   Each ASCONF-ACK chunks MUST be listed and bundled together in a
   single reply packet by ascending order of the serial number from the
   beginning of the packet.

4.1.  Procedure of the ASCONF sender in detail

   In the following discussion, a ASCONF chunk with serial(N) is
   described as ASCONF(N), and ASCONF-ACK(N) is in a same manner.

   1.  On sending an ASCONF chunk, the sender MUST look into ASCONF
       output queue to determine if there are any unacknowledged ASCONF
       chunks.  If no ASCONF chunks are present then, simply follow the
       procedure of current ADD-IP draft.

       However, if one or more ASCONF chunks are found outstanding, go
       to step 2 to send all ASCONFs bundled together.

   2.  When creating a Cumulative ASCONF chunk, all unacknowledged
       ASCONF chunks MUST be bundled together in a single packet.

       Those unacknowledged ASCONF chunks MUST NOT be modified or
       changed they MUST remain with the same information from when it
       was created.

       ASCONF chunks in a Cumulative ASCONF chunk must be bundled in a
       single packet.
   3.  These chunks MUST be listed in ascending order of their Serial
       Number.
   4.

       The size of Cumulative ASCONF chunk SHOULD NOT be larger than MTU
       size.  If it exceeds the size of MTU, the end-host SHOULD wait
       for ASCONF-ACK.

   5.  The Address Parameter must be set to 0 or one of the IP addresses
       of the association assuming that all of the ASCONFs previously
       sent were applied successfully.

   6.  The sender MUST NOT modify the ASCONF packet once it is sent.
   7.  On sending a Cumulative ASCONF chunk, the retransmission timer of
       ASCONF chunk should be restarted.

4.2.  Procedure of the ASCONF receiver in detail

   In general, the receiver of ASCONF chunk behave in the same manner as
   specified in the ADD-IP draft.

   Upon receiving an ASCONF chunk, the endpoint performs the following

   L1) Use the source and destination addresses and port numbers to
      attempt to identify the association (i.e. use the same method
      defined in RFC2960 [RFC2960] used for all other SCTP chunks).  If
      found proceed to rule L4.
   L2) If the association is not found, use the address found in the
      Address Parameter TLV combined with the port number found in the
      SCTP common header.  If found proceed to rule L4.
   L2-ext) If more than one ASCONF chunks are packed together, use the
      address found in the Address Parameter TLV of the each ASCONF
      chunk.  If found, proceed to rule L4.
   L3) If neither L1 or L2 locates the association, treat the chunk as
      an Out Of The Blue chunk as defined in RFC2960 [RFC2960].
   L4) Follow the normal rules to validate the SCTP verification tag
      found in RFC2960 [RFC2960].

   After identification and verification of the association, the
   following should be performed to properly process the ASCONF Chunk:
   M1) If the value found in the serial number of the first ASCONF chunk
      is equal to the ('Peer-Serial-Number' + 1), the endpoint clears
      any old cached ASCONF-ACK responses and then proceeds with the
      same procedures described in the ADD-IP draft.  After processing
      the receiver should cache the ASCONF-ACK response in case the peer
      retransmits the ASCONF (i.e. the response is lost).
   M2) If the value found in the serial number is less than the ('Peer-
      Serial-Number' + 1), simply skip to the next ASCONF, and include
      in the outbound response packet the previously cached ASCONF-ACK
      response that was sent and saved that matches the serial number of
      the ASCONF.
   M3) Then, process each ASCONF one by one.  If the Serial Number of
      the ASCONF is less than the ('Peer-Serial-Number' + 1),then simply
      skip it, as above, adding to the response packet the previously
      saved ASCONF-ACK response.
   M4) When the serial number matches the next one expected, process the
      ASCONF as described in the ADD-IP draft and then, after processing
      the ASCONF chunk, append an ASCONF-ACK to the response packet and
      cache a copy of it (in the event it later needs to be
      retransmitted).  If an error occurs on processing the ASCONF
      chunk, the end-host MUST stop processing the following ASCONF
      chunks and return the response packet immediately.
   M5) When all processes are ASCONF chunks are processed for packet
      containing the Cumulative ASCONF, send back the single response
      packet with all of the ASCONF-ACK chunks for all the serials in
      Cumulative ASCONF chunk.  The destination address of the ASCONF-
      ACK chunk MUST be the source address of the Cumulative ASCONF
      packet.

   M6) While processing the Cumulative ASCONF packet, if the response
      Cumulative ASCONF-ACK packet will exceed the PMTU of the return
      path, the receiver MUST stop adding additional ASCONF-ACK's into
      the response packet but MUST continue to process all of the ASCONF
      chunks, saving ASCONF-ACK responses in its cached copy.  The
      sender of the ASCONF will later retransmit the ASCONF's that were
      not responded to at which time the cached copies of the responses
      that would NOT fit in the MTU can be sent to the peer.  The cached
      copies of the responses can be sent to the peer when the sender of
      the ASCONF retransmit the unacknowledged ASCONF chunks.

4.3.  Procedure of the ASCONF-ACK receiver in detail

   The receiver of the Cumulative ASCONF-ACK packet should process each
   separate ASCONF-ACK chunk as described in the current ADD-IP
   specification.
