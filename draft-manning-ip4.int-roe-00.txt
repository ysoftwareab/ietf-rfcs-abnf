Abstract:

   This memo provides for and documents the operation of the IP4.INT
   domain. In addition, it updates RFC 1035 section 3.5[1].

IPV4.INT.

   Creation of this domain was done to provide an alternative to the
   special domain IN-ADDR.ARPA for the registration of gateway location
   and Internet address to host mapping. The intent of this domain is
   to provide an alternative method to perform host address to host name 
   mapping.

   The use of this domain is in accord with RFC 1591[2], since the mapping
   that is done consitutes an database of international significence and
   is in conjunction with the IETF, a recognized standards setting body.

   This part of the domain space is structured according to address, and
   thereby guarantee that the appropriate data can be located without an 
   exhaustive search of the domain space.

   The domain begins at IP4.INT and has a substructure which follows the
   Internet adressing structure. It is expected that there will be native
   support for bit-level delegation in the servers and resolvers to support
   variable length subnets[3].

   Until such support is available, the IP4.INT domain will follow the
   same representation structure and in section 3.5 of RFC 1035.

Security considerations of this memo

   None.
