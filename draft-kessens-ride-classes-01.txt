Abstract

   This document describes the attributes and classes that will be used
   in the internet Registry Information Database Exchange formats
   (RIDE). For now it is mostly limited to 'domain' and 'contact'
   classes since they were widely considered as most urgent. Encoding
   that will be used for the objects and ways to find and access objects
   are beyond the scope of this document. This will be addressed in the
   future in separate drafts.


Introduction

   This document follows a top-down approach. We will first describe the
   classes and then it's properties.




Kessens                                                         [Page 1]

Draft                         RIDE Classes                September 1997


   The properties are not absolutely defined. We expect certain
   attributes to have certain values, but we also expect that actual
   implementations are liberal in what they accept. Eg. being too
   restrictive when receiving attributes that have values violating the
   specification could degrade the usability of the scheme a lot while
   it doesn't really help with making a more reliable system. On the
   other hand, everybody that is going to create their own Internet
   registry is well advised to follow the guidelines of this document to
   maximize interoperatibility with other registries.

   We already talk in the document about formats while we explicitly
   told earlier not to deal with the actual dataformats yet. Assume
   those formats as examples of exactly which data is supposed to be
   carried in certain attributes, for clearness sake and as an advise
   how the contents could be shown to the *human* user. They don't
   however, tell anything yet, about how they will eventually be
   represented in the exchange format as will be defined in a separate
   document.


Definition of the Contact class

   The contact class is a class that has two different functions. It
   defines contact information. Furthermore, it can work, when
   referenced by another object, as a macro definition for
   authentication information that can be used to authenticate a message
   or authorize an update to an object when the originator is properly
   authenticated. In addition to this functionality it may define
   information on how and who to notify of changes in the object that
   referenced the contact object.

   The contact class can be referenced by a NIC handle that will be
   guaranteed to be unique world wide [document needs to written]

   handle: [mandatory]  [single]

      Defines the world-wide unique identifier for this contact. Contact
      handles will be created by no more that the first three(3) words
      of the name attribute.

   type: [mandatory]  [single]

      Defines whether the contact refers to an individual, an
      organization/role or whether it is used for
      authentication/notification purposes only.

      values:

      <INDIVIDUAL | ROLE | MNTNER>

   title: [optional]   [single]

      Can be used to determine the function/title of an individual.

   name: [mandatory]  [single]

      Full name of the contact person.

   organization: [mandatory]  [single]

      The name of the Organization this contact belongs to.

   address: [optional]  [multiple]

      The street or postal address for this(these) contact(s).

   city: [optional]  [multiple]




Kessens                                                         [Page 3]

Draft                         RIDE Classes                September 1997


      If the Address attribute is a single line then this attribute
      should contain the city the contact resides in.

   state: [optional]  [multiple]

      If this contact lives in a country that has states or provinces
      this should be used.

   postalcode: [optional]  [multiple]

   countrycode: [optional]  [multiple]

      The ISO-3166 Country Code this contact resides in.

   authscheme: [optional]  [single]

      The Scheme used to authenticate requests that responsibilities
      have been delegated to this object. Contacts that wish to be
      delegated responsibility for another object (host or domain) must
      have valid AuthScheme and AuthInfo attributes.

      Multiple schemes can be used and logical combinations can be
      formed by using '&', '|' and '!' operators:

      < AuthScheme-1 | ( AuthScheme-2 & AuthScheme-3 ) >

      A scheme can be used for authentication purposes or authorization
      of update requests.

      Curently, the following schemes are known:

      CRYPT-PW  <crypted password>

      Password is encrypted with the DES algorithm which is available on
      most UNIX systems as a library routine 'crypt'.

      MAIL-FROM <Regular expression>

      Weak authorization schema. E-mail header 'From:' line is matched
      against the regular expression and updates are accepted when a
      match is found.

      PGP       <Public key>

      Server can authenticate messages by using the specified PGP public
      key.

   notifyonsuccess: [optional]  [single]



Kessens                                                         [Page 4]

The route, aut-num, as-set, rs-set, inet-rtr and dictionary classes:

   Those classes are currently being defined by the RPS IETF working
   group.  Since there only exist two different definitions in the
   world, RIPE181 [2] and RPSL, and RIPE181 is currently being
   substituted by RPSL, we will use the RPSL definitions as the standard
   and will only describe the differences between RIDE and the RPSL
   representation. The only exception in this is the aut-num object
   which has a different format in the InterNIC registry, however, this
   is merely a matter of naming conventions.


Security considerations

   There are no security implications. The authentication/authorization
   mechanisms are a description of the systems that several Internet
   registries currently use, there is no claim made in this document
   that they are actually secure or safe. This is an issue that should
   be addressed by the individual registries.

   Furthermore, every user that registers information in an Internet
   registry should be warned that their information is globally visible
   and could be abused if no proper care is taken on which information
   one actually wanted to be visible.
