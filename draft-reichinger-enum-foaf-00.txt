Abstract

   This memo registers the Enumservice "foaf" using the URI schemes
   "http" and "https" according to the IANA Enumservice registration
   process defined in RFC3671.  The Enumservice "foaf" is to be used to
   refer from an ENUM domain name to the location of a FOAF RDF file
   using the corresponding E.164 telephone number.

   Clients may use data retrieved from a FOAF RDF file to provide caller
   or callee with information available within the Friend-Of-A-Friend

   (FOAF) Semantic Web application.  For example, the caller might be
   presented with personal information on the callee (e.g. name, gender
   and various online attributes) as well as information on the callee's
   social context (e.g. relations to friends or colleagues).

2.  Introduction

   ENUM [1] uses the Domain Name System (DNS) [3] for mapping E.164
   telephone numbers [13] to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) [4].
   Therefore E.164 numbers are converted to ENUM domain names through
   means described further in RFC3761.

   'Friend-Of-A-Friend' (FOAF) [2] describes a Semantic Web [15] project
   for machine-readable modelling of homepage-like content and social
   networks.  The FOAF specification defines terms to be used in
   statements someone can make about someone else, such as name, gender
   and various online attributes, e.g. e-mail address, instant messaging
   identifier, VoIP address or web URL.  FOAF is based on the Resource
   Description Framework (RDF) [11] defined using the Web Ontology
   Language (OWL) [12].  Typically, the FOAF RDF file is named foaf.rdf
   and made publicly available on the Web.

   Integrating FOAF and ENUM [14] potentially offers a variety of
   Semantic Web applications to be accessed by means of a telephone
   number.  The introduction of a specific Enumservice dedicated to FOAF
   significantly eases that integration.

   This memo registers an Enumservice according to the guidelines given
   in RFC3761 to be used for provisioning in the services field of a
   NAPTR [13] resource record to indicate what class of functionality a
   given end point offers.  The registration is defined within the
   Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [6][7][8][9][10]
   hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS application defined in
   RFC3761.

   This memo registers the Enumservice "foaf" using the URI schemes
   "http" and "https" according to the IANA Enumservice registration
   process defined in RFC3671.  The Enumservice "foaf" is to be used to
   refer from an ENUM domain name to the location of a FOAF RDF file
   using the corresponding E.164 telephone number.


3.  Enumservice Registrations - foaf

   The Enumservice registered in this section indicates that the
   resource identified by the associated URI is a source of FOAF data.

Internet-Draft              Enumservice foaf               February 2006


   Enumservice Name: "foaf"

   Enumservice Type: "foaf"

   Enumservice Subtype: N/A

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI is a source of FOAF data.  If the URI scheme
      "https" is used, the resource can be fetched by using TLS or the
      Secure Socket Layer protocol.

   Security Considerations: see Section 5

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Authors: Kurt Reichinger (see 'Authors' section for contact details)


4.  Example

   An example ENUM entry referring to a FOAF RDF file could look like
   following:

      $ORIGIN 1.0.1.1.1.1.5.5.5.0.8.7.3.4.e164.arpa.
      @ IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+foaf"
      !^.*$!http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/semnum/user1/foaf.rdf!" .

   Performing an ENUM query for the Austrian E.164 telephone number
   +43780555111101 will result in a referral to the web URL
   http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/semnum/user1/foaf.rdf indicating
   that a FOAF RDF file associated with that telephone number can be
   accessed there.


5.  Security & Privacy Considerations

5.1.  ENUM Record

   With ENUM utilising the DNS - a globally distributed and publicly
   accessible database - all information contained in DNS records must
   be considered publicly available.  Thus, data can be harvested,
   stored and re-used by third parties, e.g. for generating lists of
   targets for sending of unrequested information.  This could result in
   being targeted with SPAM (e-mail), SPIT (VoIP calls), junk fax, junk
   SMS or other unwanted information.  Even after removing the DNS entry



Reichinger               Expires August 18, 2006                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              Enumservice foaf               February 2006


   and the referred resource, copies of the information could still be
   available.

   Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations
   between E.164 numbers and their owners - especially if DNS records
   contain personal identifiers or domain names for which ownership
   information can easily be obtained.

   However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not
   need to contain any personal information.  It just points to a
   location where access to personal information could be granted.

   ENUM records pointing to third party resources can easily be
   provisioned on purpose by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption
   about the association between a number and an entity could therefore
   be completely bogus unless some kind of identity verification is in
   place.  This verification is out of scope for this memo.

5.2.  FOAF File

   FOAF files describe persons and online communities explicitly
   focusing on making the content easily machine-readable.  Furthermore,
   FOAF implicitly relies on information being publicly available on the
   Web.

   FOAF files potentially contain a rich variety of personal data making
   it of interest to data harvesters, e.g. for generating lists of
   targets for unrequested information.  This could result in being
   targeted with SPAM (e-mail), SPIT (VoIP calls), "junk" fax, "junk"
   SMS or other unwanted information.  Even after removing the FOAF RDF
   file and referred resources, copies of the information could still be
   available.

   Content, administration and publication of FOAF RDF files is under
   the responsibility of the individual FOAF RDF file owner.  FOAF files
   easily can be created and published on the Web by anyone - so any
   assumption about data from a FOAF RDF file and an entity could
   therefore be completely bogus unless some kind of identity
   verification is in place.  This verification is out of scope for this
   memo.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests registration of the "foaf" Enumservice according
   to the definitions in this document and RFC3761.
