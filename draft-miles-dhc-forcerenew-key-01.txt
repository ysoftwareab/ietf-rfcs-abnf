Internet-Draft        Forcerenew Key Authentication           March 2009


Abstract

   DHCP Forcerenew allows for the reconfiguration of a single host by
   forcing the DHCP client into a Renew state on a trigger from the DHCP
   server.  In Forcerenew Key Authentication the server exchanges a key
   with the client on the initial DHCP ACK that is used for subsequent
   validation of a Forcerenew message.

Internet-Draft        Forcerenew Key Authentication           March 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines extensions to Authentication for DHCP(v4)
   Messages [RFC3118] to create a new authentication protocol for DHCPv4
   Forcerenew [RFC3203] messages.  Authentication for DHCP [RFC3118] is
   mandatory for Forcerenew, however as it is currently defined
   [RFC3118] requires distribution of constant token or shared-secret
   out-of-band to DHCP clients.  The Forcerenew Key is exchanged between
   server and client on initial DHCP ACK and is used for verification of
   any subsequent Forcerenew message.

   Forcerenew Key Authentication follows the model set forward in DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] as the Reconfigure Key Authentication Protocol.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Message authentication

   The FORCERENEW message must be authenticated using either [RFC3118]
   or the proposed Forcerenew Key Authentication protocol.

2.1.  Forcerenew Key Authentication

   The Forcerenew key authentication protocol provides protection
   against misconfiguration of a client caused by a Forcerenew message
   sent by a malicious DHCP server.  In this protocol, a DHCP server
   sends a Forcerenew Key to the client in the initial exchange of DHCP
   messages.  The client records the Forcerenew Key for use in
   authenticating subsequent Forcerenew messages from that server.  The
   server then includes an HMAC computed from the Forcerenew Key in
   subsequent Forcerenew messages.

   Both the Forcerenew Key sent from the server to the client and the
   HMAC in subsequent Forcerenew messages are carried as the
   Authentication information in a DHCP Authentication option.  The
   format of the Authentication information is defined in the following
   section.

   The Forcerenew Key protocol is used (initiated by the server) only if
   the client and server are not using any other authentication protocol
   and the client and server have negotiated to use the Forcerenew Key
   Authentication protocol.

Internet-Draft        Forcerenew Key Authentication           March 2009


2.1.1.  Forcerenew Key Protocol Capability Option

   A DHCP client indicates DHCP Forcerenew Key Protocol capability by
   including a FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>) option in DHCP Discover and
   Request messages sent to the server.

   A DHCP server that does not support Forcerenew Key Protocol
   authentication should ignore the FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>)
   option.  A DHCP server indicates DHCP Forcerenew Key Protocol
   preference by including a FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>) option in any
   DHCP Offer messages sent to the client.

   A DHCP client MUST NOT send DHCP messages with authentication options
   where the protocol value is Forcerenew Key Authentication(<TBD>).

   The FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE option is a zero length option with code
   of <TDB> and format as follows:
          Code   Len
         +-----+-----+
         | TBD |  0  |
         +-----+-----+

   The client would indicate that it supports the functionality by
   inserting the FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE option in the DHCP Discover and
   Request messages.  If the server supports Forcerenew Key
   authentication and is configured to require Forcerenew Key
   authentication, it will insert the FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE option in
   the DHCP Offer message.

2.1.2.  Forcerenew Key Protocol

   [RFC3118] defined an extensible DHCPv4 authentication option which
   supports multiple protocols.  The Forcerenew Key Protocol makes use
   of the DHCP authentication option defined in [RFC3118] re-using the
   option format.

   The following fields are set in an DHCP authentication option for the
   Forcerenew Key Authentication Protocol:

   protocol  <TBD (IANA)>

   algorithm  1

   RDM  0

   The format of the Authentication information for the Forcerenew Key
   Authentication Protocol is:

                        message).

         Value   Data as defined by field.

2.1.3.  Server considerations for Forcerenew Key Authentication

   The use of Forcerenew Key Protocol is dependent on the client
   indicating its capability through the FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>)
   DHCP option in any DHCP Discover or Request messages.  The DHCP
   Discovery or Request message from the client MUST contain the
   FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>) option if the Forcerenew Key Protocol
   is to be used by the server.  The absence of the
   FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>) option indicates to the server that the
   Forcerenew Key Authentication protocol is not supported and thus the
   server MUST NOT include a Forcerenew Key Protocol Authentication
   option in the DHCP Ack.

   The server indicates its support of the Forcerenew Key Protocol
   authentication by including the DHCP FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBDP>)
   option in the DHCP Offer message.  The server SHOULD NOT include this
   option unless the client has indicated its capability in a DHCP
   Discovery message .  The presence of the
   FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TDB>) option in the DHCP offer may be used by
   clients to prefer Forcerenew Key Protocol authentication-capable DHCP
   servers over those servers which do not support such capability.

   The server selects a Forcerenew Key for a client only during Request/
   Ack message exchange.  The server records the Forcerenew Key and
   transmits that key to the client in an Authentication option in the
   DHCP Ack message.

   The Forcerenew Key is 128 bits long, and MUST be a cryptographically

   strong random or pseudo-random number that cannot easily be
   predicted.  The key is imbedded as a 128-bit value of the
   Authentication information where type is set to 1 (Forcerenew Key
   Value).

   To provide authentication for a Forcerenew message, the server
   selects a replay detection value according to the RDM selected by the
   server, and computes an HMAC-MD5 of the Forcerenew message using the
   Forcerenew Key for the client.  The server computes the HMAC-MD5 over
   the entire DHCP Forcerenew message, including the Authentication
   option; the HMAC-MD5 field in the Authentication option is set to
   zero for the HMAC-MD5 computation.  The server includes the HMAC-MD5
   in the authentication information field in an Authentication option
   included in the Forcerenew message sent to the client with type set
   to 2 (HMAC-MD5 digest).

2.1.4.  Client considerations for Forcerenew Key Authentication

   The client MUST indicate Forcerenew Key Capability by including the
   FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>) DHCP option (Section 2.1.1) in all DHCP
   Discover and Request messages.  DHCP servers that support Forcerenew
   Key Protocol authentication MUST include the DHCP Forcerenew Key
   protocol authentication option in DHCP Offers with type set to
   zero(0), allowing the client to use this capability in selecting DHCP
   servers should multiple Offers arrive.

   A DHCP server has indicates its support through the inclusion of the
   FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABLE(<TBD>) option in the DHCP Offer.  The client
   MUST validate the DHCP Ack message contains a Forcerenew Key in a
   DHCP authentication option.  If the server has indicated capability
   for Forcerenew Key Protocol authentication in the DHCP Offer and a
   subsequent Ack omits a valid DHCP authentication option for the
   Forcerenew Key Protocol, the client MUST send a DHCP Decline message
   and return to the DHCP Init state.

   The client will receive a Forcerenew Key from the server in the
   initial DHCP Ack message from the server.  The client records the
   Forcerenew Key for use in authenticating subsequent Forcerenew
   messages.

   To authenticate a Forcerenew message, the client computes an HMAC-MD5
   over the DHCP Forcerenew message, using the Forcerenew Key received
   from the server.  If this computed HMAC-MD5 matches the value in the
   Authentication option, the client accepts the Forcerenew message.

3.  Contributors

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the DHC WG mailing
   list (dhcwg@ietf.org) and/or the authors.  This contribution is based
   on work by Vitali Vinokour.  Major sections of this draft use
   modified text from [RFC3315].  The authors wish to thank Ted Lemon
   and Bernie Volz for their support.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to allocate an option code for the newly
   defined DHCP option FORCERENEW_KEY_CAPABALE as described in the text.

   This document requests IANA to allocate a DHCP Authentication
   Option(90) protocol number be assigned for Forcerenew Key
   Authentication, per [RFC3118].

   This document requests IANA to create a new namespace associated with
   the Forcerenew Key Authentication protocol: algorithm, per [RFC3118].


5.  Security Considerations

   As in some network environments FORCERENEW can be used to snoop and
   spoof traffic, the FORCERENEW message MUST be authenticated using the
   procedures as described in [RFC3118] or this proposal.  FORCERENEW
   messages failing the authentication should be silently discarded by
   the client.

5.1.  Protocol vulnerabilities

   The mechanism described in this document is vulnerable to a denial of
   service attack through flooding a client with bogus FORCERENEW
   messages.  The calculations involved in authenticating the bogus
   FORECERENEW messages may overwhelm the device on which the client is
   running.

   The mechanism described provides protection against the use of a
   FORCERENEW message by a malicious DHCP server to mount a denial of
   service or man-in-the-middle attack on a client.  This protocol can
   be compromised by an attacker that can intercept the initial message
   in which the DHCP server sends the key to the client.
