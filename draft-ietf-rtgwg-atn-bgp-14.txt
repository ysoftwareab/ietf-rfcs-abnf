                      draft-ietf-rtgwg-atn-bgp-14

Abstract

   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is investigating
   mobile routing solutions for a worldwide Aeronautical
   Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol Services (ATN/IPS).
   The ATN/IPS will eventually replace existing communication services
   with an IP-based service supporting pervasive Air Traffic Management
   (ATM) for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC), Airline Operations
   Controllers (AOC), and all commercial aircraft worldwide.  This
   informational document describes a simple and extensible mobile
   routing service based on industry-standard BGP to address the ATN/IPS
   requirements.

1.  Introduction

   The worldwide Air Traffic Management (ATM) system today uses a
   service known as Aeronautical Telecommunications Network based on
   Open Systems Interconnection (ATN/OSI).  The service is used to
   augment controller to pilot voice communications with rudimentary
   short text command and control messages.  The service has seen
   successful deployment in a limited set of worldwide ATM domains.

   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is now
   undertaking the development of a next-generation replacement for ATN/
   OSI known as Aeronautical Telecommunications Network with Internet
   Protocol Services (ATN/IPS) [ATN][ATN-IPS].  ATN/IPS will eventually

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS               February 2022


   provide an IPv6-based [RFC8200] service supporting pervasive ATM for
   Air Traffic Controllers (ATC), Airline Operations Controllers (AOC),
   and all commercial aircraft worldwide.  As part of the ATN/IPS
   undertaking, a new mobile routing service will be needed.  This
   document presents an approach based on the Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP) [RFC4271].

   Aircraft communicate via wireless aviation data links that typically
   support much lower data rates than terrestrial wireless and wired-
   line communications.  For example, some Very High Frequency (VHF)-
   based data links only support data rates on the order of 32Kbps and
   an emerging L-Band data link that is expected to play a key role in
   future aeronautical communications only supports rates on the order
   of 1Mbps.  Although satellite data links can provide much higher data
   rates during optimal conditions, like any other aviation data link
   they are subject to errors, delay, disruption, signal intermittence,
   degradation due to atmospheric conditions, etc.  The well-connected
   ground domain ATN/IPS network should therefore treat each safety-of-
   flight critical packet produced by (or destined to) an aircraft as a
   precious commodity and strive for an optimized service that provides
   the highest possible degree of reliability.  Furthermore, continuous
   performance-intensive control messaging services such as BGP peering
   sessions must be carried only over the well-connected ground domain
   ATN/IPS network and never over low-end aviation data links.

   The ATN/IPS is an IP-based overlay network configured over one or
   more Internetworking underlays ("INETs") maintained by aeronautical
   network service providers such as ARINC, SITA and Inmarsat.  The
   Overlay Multilink Network Interface (OMNI) [I-D.templin-6man-omni]
   uses an adaptation layer encapsulation to create a Non-Broadcast,
   Multiple Access (NBMA) virtual link spanning the entire ATN/IPS.
   Each aircraft connects to the OMNI link via an OMNI interface
   configured over the aircraft's underlying physical and/or virtual
   access network interfaces.

   Each underlying INET comprises one or more "partitions" where all
   nodes within a partition can exchange packets with all other nodes,
   i.e., the partition is connected internally.  There is no requirement
   that each INET partition uses the same IP protocol version nor has
   consistent IP addressing plans in comparison with other partitions.
   Instead, the OMNI link sees each partition as a "segment" of a link-
   layer topology concatenated by a service known as the OMNI Adaptation
   Layer (OAL) [I-D.templin-6man-omni] based on IPv6 encapsulation
   [RFC2473].

   The IPv6 addressing architecture provides different classes of
   addresses, including Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs), Unique Local
   Addresses (ULAs) and Link-Local Addresses (LLAs) [RFC4291][RFC4193].

   The ATN/IPS receives an IPv6 GUA Mobility Service Prefix (MSP) from
   an Internet assigned numbers authority, and each aircraft will
   receive a Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) delegation from the MSP that
   accompanies the aircraft wherever it travels.  ATCs and AOCs will
   likewise receive MNPs, but they would typically appear in static (not
   mobile) deployments such as air traffic control towers, airline
   headquarters, etc.  (Note that while IPv6 GUAs are assumed for ATN/
   IPS, IPv4 with public/private address could also be used.)

   The adaptation layer uses ULAs in the source and destination
   addresses of adaptation layer IPv6 encapsulation headers.  Each ULA
   includes an MNP in the interface identifier ("MNP-ULA"), as discussed
   in [I-D.templin-6man-omni].  Due to MNP delegation policies and
   random node mobility properties, MNP-ULAs are generally not
   aggregatable in the BGP routing service and are represented as many
   more-specific prefixes instead of a smaller number of aggregated
   prefixes.

   In addition, BGP routing service infrastructure nodes configure
   administratively-assigned ULAs ("ADM-ULA") that are statically-
   assigned and derived from a shorter ADM-ULA prefix assigned to their
   BGP network partitions.  Unlike MNP-ULAs, the ADM-ULAs are
   persistently present and unchanging in the routing system.  The BGP
   routing services therefore establish forwarding table entries based
   on these MNP-ULAs and ADM-ULAs instead of based on the GUA MNPs
   themselves.  Both ADM-ULAs and MNP-ULAs are used by the OAL for
   nested encapsulation where the inner IPv6 packet is encapsulated in
   an IPv6 adaptation layer header with ULA source and destination
   addresses, which is then encapsulated in an IP header specific to the
   underlying Internetwork that will carry the actual packet
   transmission.  A high level ATN/IPS network diagram is shown in
   Figure 1:

   Connexion By Boeing [CBB] was an early aviation mobile routing
   service based on dynamic updates in the global public Internet BGP
   routing system.  Practical experience with the approach has shown
   that frequent injections and withdrawals of prefixes in the Internet
   routing system can result in excessive BGP update messaging, slow
   routing table convergence times, and extended outages when no route
   is available.  This is due to both conservative default BGP protocol
   timing parameters (see Section 6) and the complex peering
   interconnections of BGP routers within the global Internet
   infrastructure.  The situation is further exacerbated by frequent
   aircraft mobility events that each result in BGP updates that must be
   propagated to all BGP routers in the Internet that carry a full
   routing table.

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS               February 2022


   We therefore consider an approach using a BGP overlay network routing
   system where a private BGP routing protocol instance is maintained
   between ATN/IPS Autonomous System (AS) Border Routers (ASBRs).  The
   private BGP instance does not interact with the native BGP routing
   systems in underlying INETs, and BGP updates are unidirectional from
   "stub" ASBRs (s-ASBRs) to a small set of "core" ASBRs (c-ASBRs) in a
   hub-and-spokes topology.  No extensions to the BGP protocol are
   necessary, and BGP routing is based on (intermediate-layer) ULAs
   instead of upper- or lower-layer public/private IP prefixes.  This
   allows ASBRs to perform adaptation layer forwarding based on
   intermediate layer IPv6 header information instead of network layer
   forwarding based on upper layer IP header information or link layer
   forwarding based on lower layer IP header information.

   The s-ASBRs for each stub AS connect to a small number of c-ASBRs via
   dedicated high speed links and/or secured tunnels (e.g., IPsec
   [RFC4301], WireGuard [WG], etc.) over the underlying INET.
   Neighboring ASBRs should use also such IP layer security
   encapsulations over direct physical links to ensure INET layer
   security.

   The s-ASBRs engage in external BGP (eBGP) peerings with their
   respective c-ASBRs, and only maintain routing table entries for the
   MNP-ULAs currently active within the stub AS.  The s-ASBRs send BGP
   updates for MNP-ULA injections or withdrawals to c-ASBRs but do not
   receive any BGP updates from c-ASBRs.  Instead, the s-ASBRs maintain
   default routes with their c-ASBRs as the next hop, and therefore hold
   only partial topology information.

   The c-ASBRs connect to other c-ASBRs within the same partition using
   internal BGP (iBGP) peerings over which they collaboratively maintain
   a full routing table for all active MNP-ULAs currently in service
   within the partition.  Therefore, only the c-ASBRs maintain a full
   BGP routing table and never send any BGP updates to s-ASBRs.  This
   simple routing model therefore greatly reduces the number of BGP
   updates that need to be synchronized among peers, and the number is
   reduced further still when intradomain routing changes within stub
   ASes are processed within the AS instead of being propagated to the
   core.  BGP Route Reflectors (RRs) [RFC4456] can also be used to
   support increased scaling properties.

   When there are multiple INET partitions, the c-ASBRs of each
   partition use eBGP to peer with the c-ASBRs of other partitions so
   that the full set of ULAs for all partitions are known globally among
   all of the c-ASBRs.  Each c/s-ASBR further configures an ADM-ULA
   which is taken from an ADM-ULA prefix assigned to each partition, as
   well as static forwarding table entries for all other OMNI link
   partition prefixes.  Both ADM-ULAs and MNP-ULAs are used by the OAL

   for nested encapsulation where the inner IPv6 packet is encapsulated
   in an IPv6 OAL header with ULA source and destination addresses,
   which is then encapsulated in an IP header specific to the INET
   partition.

   With these intra- and inter-INET BGP peerings in place, a forwarding
   plane spanning tree is established that properly covers the entire
   operating domain.  All nodes in the network can be visited using
   strict spanning tree hops, but in many instances this may result in
   longer paths than are necessary.  AERO [I-D.templin-6man-aero]
   provides an example service for discovering and utilizing (route-
   optimized) shortcuts that do not always follow strict spanning tree
   paths.

   The remainder of this document discusses the proposed BGP-based ATN/
   IPS mobile routing service.

2.  Terminology

   The terms Autonomous System (AS) and Autonomous System Border Router
   (ASBR) are the same as defined in [RFC4271].

   The following terms are defined for the purposes of this document:

   Air Traffic Management (ATM)
      The worldwide service for coordinating safe aviation operations.

   Air Traffic Controller (ATC)
      A government agent responsible for coordinating with aircraft
      within a defined operational region via voice and/or data Command
      and Control messaging.

   Airline Operations Controller (AOC)
      An airline agent responsible for tracking and coordinating with
      aircraft within their fleet.

   Aeronautical Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol
   Services (ATN/IPS)
      A future aviation network for ATCs and AOCs to coordinate with all
      aircraft operating worldwide.  The ATN/IPS will be an IPv6-based
      overlay network service that connects access networks via
      tunneling over one or more Internetworking underlays.

   Internetworking underlay ("INET")
      A wide-area network that supports overlay network tunneling and
      connects Radio Access Networks to the rest of the ATN/IPS.
      Example INET service providers for civil aviation include ARINC,
      SITA and Inmarsat.

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS               February 2022


   (Radio) Access Network ("ANET")
      An aviation radio data link service provider's network, including
      radio transmitters and receivers as well as supporting ground-
      domain infrastructure needed to convey a customer's data packets
      to outside INETs.  The term ANET is intended in the same spirit as
      for radio-based Internet service provider networks (e.g., cellular
      operators), but can also refer to ground-domain networks that
      connect AOCs and ATCs.

   partition (or "segment")
      A fully-connected internal subnetwork of an INET in which all
      nodes can communicate with all other nodes within the same
      partition using the same IP protocol version and addressing plan.
      Each INET consists of one or more partitions.

   Overlay Multilink Network Interface (OMNI)
      A virtual layer 2 bridging service that presents an ATN/IPS
      overlay unified link view even though the underlay may consist of
      multiple INET partitions.  The OMNI virtual link is manifested
      through nested encapsulation in which original IP packets from the
      ATN/IPS are first encapsulated in ULA-addressed IPv6 headers which
      are then forwarded to the next hop using INET encapsulation if
      necessary.  Forwarding over the OMNI virtual link is therefore
      based on ULAs instead of the original IP addresses.  In this way,
      packets sent from a source can be conveyed over the OMNI virtual
      link even though there may be many underlying INET partitions in
      the path to the destination.

   OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL)
      A middle layer below the IP layer but above the INET layer that
      applies IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation prior to INET encapsulation.  The
      IPv6 encapsulation header inserted by the OAL uses ULAs instead of
      GUAs.  End systems that configure OMNI interfaces act as OAL
      ingress and egress points, while intermediate systems with OMNI
      interfaces act as OAL forwarding nodes.  There may be zero, one or
      many intermediate nodes between the OAL ingress and egress, but
      the upper layer IPv6 Hop Limit is not decremented during (OAL
      layer) forwarding.  Further details on OMNI and the OAL are found
      in [I-D.templin-6man-omni].

   OAL Autonomous System (OAL AS)
      A "hub-of-hubs" autonomous system maintained through peerings
      between the core autonomous systems of different OMNI virtual link
      partitions.

   Core Autonomous System Border Router (c-ASBR)
      A BGP router located in the hub of the INET partition hub-and-
      spokes overlay network topology.

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS               February 2022


   Core Autonomous System (Core AS)
      The "hub" autonomous system maintained by all c-ASBRs within the
      same partition.

   Stub Autonomous System Border Router (s-ASBR)
      A BGP router configured as a spoke in the INET partition hub-and-
      spokes overlay network topology.

   Stub Autonomous System (Stub AS)
      A logical grouping that includes all Clients currently associated
      with a given s-ASBR.

   Client
      An ATC, AOC or aircraft that connects to the ATN/IPS as a leaf
      node.  The Client could be a singleton host, or a router that
      connects a mobile or fixed network.

   Proxy/Server
      An ANET/INET border node that acts as a transparent intermediary
      between Clients and s-ASBRs.  From the Client's perspective, the
      Proxy/Server presents the appearance that the Client is
      communicating directly with the s-ASBR.  From the s-ASBR's
      perspective, the Proxy/Server presents the appearance that the
      s-ASBR is communicating directly with the Client.

   Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)
      An IPv6 prefix that is delegated to any ATN/IPS end system,
      including ATCs, AOCs, and aircraft.

   Mobility Service Prefix (MSP)
      An aggregated IP prefix assigned to the ATN/IPS by an Internet
      assigned numbers authority, and from which all MNPs are delegated
      (e.g., up to 2**32 IPv6 /56 MNPs could be delegated from a /24
      MSP).

3.  ATN/IPS Routing System

   The ATN/IPS routing system comprises a private BGP instance
   coordinated in an overlay network via tunnels between neighboring
   ASBRs over one or more underlying INETs.  The ATN/IPS routing system
   interacts with underlying INET BGP routing systems only through the
   static advertisement of a small and unchanging set of MSPs instead of
   the full dynamically changing set of MNPs.

   Within each INET partition, each s-ASBR connects a stub AS to the
   INET partition core using a distinct stub AS Number (ASN).  Each
   s-ASBR further uses eBGP to peer with one or more c-ASBRs.  All
   c-ASBRs are members of the INET partition core AS, and use a shared

   core ASN.  Unique ASNs are assigned according to the standard 32-bit
   ASN format [RFC4271][RFC6793].  Since the BGP instance does not
   connect with any INET BGP routing systems, the ASNs can be assigned
   from the [RFC6996] 32-bit ASN space which reserves 94,967,295 numbers
   for private use.  The ASNs must be allocated and managed by an ATN/
   IPS assigned numbers authority established by ICAO, which must ensure
   that ASNs are responsibly distributed without duplication and/or
   overlap.

   The c-ASBRs use iBGP to maintain a synchronized consistent view of
   all active MNP-ULAs currently in service within the INET partition.
   Figure 2 below represents the reference INET partition deployment.
   (Note that the figure shows details for only two s-ASBRs (s-ASBR1 and
   s-ASBR2) due to space constraints, but the other s-ASBRs should be
   understood to have similar Stub AS, MNP and eBGP peering
   arrangements.)  The solution described in this document is flexible
   enough to extend to these topologies.

               Figure 2: INET Partition Reference Deployment

   In the reference deployment, each s-ASBR maintains routes for active
   MNP-ULAs that currently belong to its stub AS.  In response to
   "Inter-domain" mobility events, each s-ASBR dynamically announces new
   MNP-ULAs and withdraws departed MNP-ULAs in its eBGP updates to
   c-ASBRs.  Since ATN/IPS end systems are expected to remain within the
   same stub AS for extended timeframes, however, intra-domain mobility
   events (such as an aircraft handing off between cell towers) are
   handled within the stub AS instead of being propagated as inter-
   domain eBGP updates.

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS               February 2022


   Each c-ASBR configures a black-hole route for each of its MSPs.  By
   black-holing the MSPs, the c-ASBR maintains forwarding table entries
   only for the MNP-ULAs that are currently active.  If an arriving
   packet matches a black-hole route without matching an MNP-ULA, the
   c-ASBR should drop the packet and may also generate an ICMPv6
   Destination Unreachable message [RFC4443], i.e., without forwarding
   the packet outside of the ATN/IPS overlay based on a less-specific
   route.

   The c-ASBRs do not send BGP updates for MNP-ULAs to s-ASBRs, but
   instead originate a default route.  In this way, s-ASBRs have only
   partial topology knowledge (i.e., they know only about the active
   MNP-ULAs currently within their stub ASes) and they forward all other
   packets to c-ASBRs which have full topology knowledge.

   Each s-ASBR and c-ASBR configures an ADM-ULA that is aggregatable
   within an INET partition, and each partition configures a unique ADM-
   ULA prefix that is permanently announced into the routing system.
   The core ASes of each INET partition are joined together through
   external BGP peerings.  The c-ASBRs of each partition establish
   external peerings with the c-ASBRs of other partitions to form a
   "core-of-cores" OMNI link AS.  The OMNI link AS contains the global
   knowledge of all MNP-ULAs deployed worldwide, and supports ATN/IPS
   overlay communications between nodes located in different INET
   partitions by virtue of OAL encapsulation.  OMNI link nodes can then
   navigate to ASBRs by including an ADM-ULA or directly to an end
   system by including an MNP-ULA in the destination address of an OAL-
   encapsulated packet (see: [I-D.templin-6man-aero]).  Figure 3 shows a
   reference OAL topology.

                 Figure 3: Spanning Partitions with the OAL

   Scaling properties of this ATN/IPS routing system are limited by the
   number of BGP routes that can be carried by the c-ASBRs.  A 2015
   study showed that BGP routers in the global public Internet at that
   time carried more than 500K routes with linear growth and no signs of
   router resource exhaustion [BGP].  A more recent network emulation
   study also showed that a single c-ASBR can accommodate at least 1M
   dynamically changing BGP routes even on a lightweight virtual
   machine.  Commercially-available high-performance dedicated router
   hardware can support many millions of routes.

   Therefore, assuming each c-ASBR can carry 1M or more routes, this
   means that at least 1M ATN/IPS end system MNP-ULAs can be serviced by
   a single set of c-ASBRs and that number could be further increased by
   using RRs and/or more powerful routers.  Another means of increasing
   scale would be to assign a different set of c-ASBRs for each set of
   MSPs.  In that case, each s-ASBR still peers with one or more c-ASBRs
   from each set of c-ASBRs, but the s-ASBR institutes route filters so
   that it only sends BGP updates to the specific set of c-ASBRs that
   aggregate the MSP.  In this way, each set of c-ASBRs maintains
   separate routing and forwarding tables so that scaling is distributed

   across multiple c-ASBR sets instead of concentrated in a single
   c-ASBR set.  For example, a first c-ASBR set could aggregate an MSP
   segment A::/32, a second set could aggregate B::/32, a third could
   aggregate C::/32, etc.  The union of all MSP segments would then
   constitute the collective MSP(s) for the entire ATN/IPS, with
   potential for supporting many millions of mobile networks or more.

   In this way, each set of c-ASBRs services a specific set of MSPs, and
   each s-ASBR configures MSP-specific routes that list the correct set
   of c-ASBRs as next hops.  This design also allows for natural
   incremental deployment, and can support initial medium-scale
   deployments followed by dynamic deployment of additional ATN/IPS
   infrastructure elements without disturbing the already-deployed base.
   For example, a few more c-ASBRs could be added if the MNP service
   demand ever outgrows the initial deployment.  For larger-scale
   applications (such as unmanned air vehicles and terrestrial vehicles)
   even larger scales can be accommodated by adding more c-ASBRs.

4.  ATN/IPS (Radio) Access Network (ANET) Model

   (Radio) Access Networks (ANETs) connect end system Clients such as
   aircraft, ATCs, AOCs etc. to the ATN/IPS routing system.  Clients may
   connect to multiple ANETs at once, for example, when they have both
   satellite and cellular data links activated simultaneously.  Clients
   configure an Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interface
   [I-D.templin-6man-omni] over their underlying ANET interfaces as a
   connection to an NBMA virtual link (manifested by the OAL) that spans
   the entire ATN/IPS.  Clients may further move between ANETs in a
   manner that is perceived as a network layer mobility event.  Clients
   could therefore employ a multilink/mobility routing service such as
   those discussed in Section 7.

   Clients register all of their active data link connections with their
   serving s-ASBRs as discussed in Section 3.  Clients may connect to
   s-ASBRs either directly, or via a Proxy/Server at the ANET/INET
   boundary.

   Figure 4 shows the ATN/IPS ANET model where Clients connect to ANETs
   via aviation data links.  Clients register their ANET addresses with
   a nearby s-ASBR, where the registration process may be brokered by a
   Proxy/Server at the edge of the ANET.

   When a Client connects to an ANET it specifies a nearby s-ASBR that
   it has selected to connect to the ATN/IPS.  The login process is
   transparently brokered by a Proxy/Server at the border of the ANET
   which then conveys the connection request to the s-ASBR via tunneling
   across the OMNI virtual link.  Each ANET border Proxy/Server is also
   equally capable of serving in the s-ASBR role so that a first on-link
   Proxy/Server can be selected as the s-ASBR while all others perform
   the Proxy/Server role in a hub-and-spokes arrangement.  An on-link
   Proxy/Server is selected to serve the s-ASBR role when it receives a
   control message from a Client requesting that service.

   The Client can coordinate with a network-based s-ASBR over additional
   ANETs after it has already coordinated with a first-hop Proxy/Server
   over a first ANET.  If the Client connects to multiple ANETs, the
   s-ASBR will register the individual ANET Proxy/Servers as conduits
   through which the Client can be reached.  The Client then sees the

   s-ASBR as the "hub" in a "hub-and-spokes" arrangement with the first-
   hop Proxy/Servers as spokes.  Selection of a network-based s-ASBR is
   through the discovery methods specified in relevant mobility and
   virtual link coordination specifications (e.g., see AERO
   [I-D.templin-6man-aero] and OMNI [I-D.templin-6man-omni]).

   The s-ASBR represents all of its active Clients as MNP-ULA routes in
   the ATN/IPS BGP routing system.  The s-ASBR's stub AS is therefore
   used only to advertise the set of MNPs of all its active Clients to
   its BGP peer c-ASBRs and not to peer with other s-ASBRs (i.e., the
   stub AS is a logical construct and not a physical one).  The s-ASBR
   injects the MNP-ULAs of its active Clients and withdraws the MNP-ULAs
   of its departed Clients via BGP updates to c-ASBRs, which further
   propagate the MNP-ULAs to other c-ASBRs within the OAL AS.  Since
   Clients are expected to remain associated with their current s-ASBR
   for extended periods, the level of MNP-ULA injections and withdrawals
   in the BGP routing system will be on the order of the numbers of
   network joins, leaves and s-ASBR handovers for aircraft operations
   (see: Section 6).  It is important to observe that fine-grained
   events such as Client mobility and Quality of Service (QoS) signaling
   are coordinated only by Proxies and the Client's current s-ASBRs, and
   do not involve other ASBRs in the routing system.  In this way,
   intradomain routing changes within the stub AS are not propagated
   into the rest of the ATN/IPS BGP routing system.

5.  ATN/IPS Route Optimization

   ATN/IPS end systems will frequently need to communicate with
   correspondents associated with other s-ASBRs.  In the BGP peering
   topology discussed in Section 3, this can initially only be
   accommodated by including multiple extraneous hops and/or spanning
   tree segments in the forwarding path.  In many cases, it would be
   desirable to establish a "short cut" around this "dogleg" route so
   that packets can traverse a minimum number of tunneling hops across
   the OMNI virtual link.  ATN/IPS end systems could therefore employ a
   route optimization service according to the mobility service employed
   (see: Section 7).

   Each s-ASBR provides designated routing services for only a subset of
   all active Clients, and instead acts as a simple Proxy/Server for
   other Clients.  As a designated router, the s-ASBR advertises the
   MNPs of each of its active Clients into the ATN/IPS routing system
   and provides basic (unoptimized) forwarding services when necessary.
   An s-ASBR could be the first-hop ATN/IPS service access point for
   some, all or none of a Client's underlying interfaces, while the
   Client's other underlying interfaces employ the Proxy/Server function
   of other s-ASBRs.  Route optimization allows Client-to-Client
   communications while bypassing s-ASBR designated routing services
   whenever possible.

   A route optimization example is shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 below.
   In the first figure, multiple spanning tree segments between Proxy/
   Servers and ASBRs are necessary to convey packets between Clients
   associated with different s-ASBRs.  In the second figure, the
   optimized route tunnels packets directly between Proxy/Servers
   without involving the ASBRs.

   These route optimized paths are established through secured control
   plane messaging (i.e., over secured tunnels and/or using higher-layer
   control message authentications) but do not provide lower-layer
   security for the data plane.  Data communications over these route
   optimized paths should therefore employ higher-layer security.

6.  BGP Protocol Considerations

   The number of eBGP peering sessions that each c-ASBR must service is
   proportional to the number of s-ASBRs in its local partition.
   Network emulations with lightweight virtual machines have shown that
   a single c-ASBR can service at least 100 eBGP peerings from s-ASBRs
   that each advertise 10K MNP-ULA routes (i.e., 1M total).  It is
   expected that robust c-ASBRs can service many more peerings than this
   - possibly by multiple orders of magnitude.  But even assuming a
   conservative limit, the number of s-ASBRs could be increased by also
   increasing the number of c-ASBRs.  Since c-ASBRs also peer with each
   other using iBGP, however, larger-scale c-ASBR deployments may need
   to employ an adjunct facility such as BGP Route Reflectors
   (RRs)[RFC4456].






Templin, et al.          Expires 18 August 2022                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft               BGP for ATN/IPS               February 2022


   The number of aircraft in operation at a given time worldwide is
   likely to be significantly less than 1M, but we will assume this
   number for a worst-case analysis.  Assuming a worst-case average 1
   hour flight profile from gate-to-gate with 10 service region
   transitions per flight, the entire system will need to service at
   most 10M BGP updates per hour (2778 updates per second).  This number
   is within the realm of the peak BGP update messaging seen in the
   global public Internet today [BGP2].  Assuming a BGP update message
   size of 100 bytes (800bits), the total amount of BGP control message
   traffic to a single c-ASBR will be less than 2.5Mbps which is a
   nominal rate for modern data links.

   Industry standard BGP routers provide configurable parameters with
   conservative default values.  For example, the default hold time is
   90 seconds, the default keepalive time is 1/3 of the hold time, and
   the default MinRouteAdvertisementinterval is 30 seconds for eBGP
   peers and 5 seconds for iBGP peers (see Section 10 of [RFC4271]).
   For the simple mobile routing system described herein, these
   parameters can be set to more aggressive values to support faster
   neighbor/link failure detection and faster routing protocol
   convergence times.  For example, a hold time of 3 seconds and a
   MinRouteAdvertisementinterval of 0 seconds for both iBGP and eBGP.

   Instead of adjusting BGP default time values, BGP routers can use the
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol [RFC5880] to
   quickly detect link failures that don't result in interface state
   changes, BGP peer failures, and administrative state changes.  BFD is
   important in environments where rapid response to failures is
   required for routing reconvergence and, hence, communications
   continuity.

   Each c-ASBR will be using eBGP both in the ATN/IPS and the INET with
   the ATN/IPS unicast IPv6 routes resolving over INET routes.
   Consequently, c-ASBRs and potentially s-ASBRs will need to support
   separate local ASes for the two BGP routing domains and routing
   policy or assure routes are not propagated between the two BGP
   routing domains.  From a conceptual, operational and correctness
   standpoint, the implementation should provide isolation between the
   two BGP routing domains (e.g., separate BGP instances).

   ADM-ULAs and MNP-ULAs begin with fd00::/8 followed by a pseudo-random
   40-bit global ID to form the prefix [ULA]::/48, along with a 16-bit
   OMNI link identifier '*' to form the prefix [ULA*]::/64.  Each
   individual address taken from [ULA*]::/64 includes additional routing
   information in the interface identifier.  For example, for the MNP
   2001:db8:1:0::/56, the resulting MNP-ULA is [ULA*]:2001:db8:1:0/120,
   and for the administrative address 1001:2002/16 the ADM-ULA is
   [ULA*]::1001:2002/112 (see: [I-D.templin-6man-omni] for further

   details).  This gives rise to a BGP routing system that must
   accommodate large numbers of long and non-aggregatable MNP-ULA
   prefixes as well as moderate numbers of long and semi-aggregatable
   ADM-ULA prefixes.  The system is kept stable and scalable through the
   s-ASBR / c-ASBR hub-and-spokes topology which ensures that mobility-
   related churn is not exposed to the core.

7.  Stub AS Mobile Routing Services

   Stub ASes maintain intradomain routing information for mobile node
   clients, and are responsible for all localized mobility signaling
   without disturbing the BGP routing system.  Clients can enlist the
   services of a candidate mobility service such as Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
   [RFC6275], LISP [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] or AERO
   [I-D.templin-6man-aero] according to the service offered by the stub
   AS.  Further details of mobile routing services are out of scope for
   this document.

8.  Implementation Status

   The BGP routing topology described in this document has been modeled
   in realistic network emulations showing that at least 1 million MNP-
   ULAs can be propagated to each c-ASBR even on lightweight virtual
   machines.  No BGP routing protocol extensions need to be adopted.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not introduce any IANA considerations.

10.  Security Considerations

   ATN/IPS ASBRs on the open Internet are susceptible to the same attack
   profiles as for any Internet nodes.  For this reason, ASBRs should
   employ physical security and/or IP securing mechanisms such as IPsec
   [RFC4301], WireGuard [WG], etc.

   ATN/IPS ASBRs present targets for Distributed Denial of Service
   (DDoS) attacks.  This concern is no different than for any node on
   the open Internet, where attackers could send spoofed packets to the
   node at high data rates.  This can be mitigated by connecting ATN/IPS
   ASBRs over dedicated links with no connections to the Internet and/or
   when ASBR connections to the Internet are only permitted through
   well-managed firewalls.

   ATN/IPS s-ASBRs should institute rate limits to protect low data rate
   aviation data links from receiving DDoS packet floods.

   BGP protocol message exchanges and control message exchanges used for
   route optimization must be secured to ensure the integrity of the
   system-wide routing information base.  Security is based on IP layer
   security associations between peers which ensure confidentiality,
   integrity and authentication over secured tunnels (see above).
   Higher layer security protection such as TCP-AO [RFC5926] is
   therefore optional, since it would be redundant with the security
   provided at lower layers.

   Data communications over route optimized paths should employ end-to-
   end higher-layer security since only the control plane and
   unoptimized paths are protected by lower-layer security.  End-to-end
   higher-layer security mechanisms include QUIC-TLS [RFC9001], TLS
   [RFC8446], DTLS [RFC6347], SSH [RFC4251], etc. applied in a manner
   outside the scope of this document.

   This document does not include any new specific requirements for
   mitigation of DDoS.

10.1.  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Considerations

   In development of the overall ATN/IPS operational concept, ICAO
   addressed the security concerns in multiple ways to ensure
   coordination and consistency across the various groups.  This also
   avoided potential duplicative work.  Technical provisions related
   specifically to the operation of ATN/IPS are specified in supporting
   ATN/IPS standards.  However, other considerations such as the
   establishment of a PKI, were determined to have an impact beyond ATN/
   IPS.  ICAO created a Trust Framework Study Group (TFSG) to define
   various governance, policy, procedures and overall technical
   performance requirements for system connectivity and
   interoperability.

   As part of their charter, the TSFG is specifically developing a
   concept of operations for a common aviation digital trust framework
   and principles to facilitate an interoperable secure, cyber resilient
   and seamless exchange of information in a digitally connected
   environment.  They are also developing governance principles, policy,
   procedures and requirements for establishing digital identity for a
   global trust framework that will consider any exchange of information
   among users of the aviation ecosystem, and to promote these concepts
   with all relevant stakeholders.

   ATN/IPS will take advantage of the developments of TFSG within the
   overall ATN/IPS operational concept.  As such, this will include the
   usage of the PKI specification resulting from the TFSG.

Appendix A.  BGP Convergence Considerations

   Experimental evidence has shown that BGP convergence time required
   after an MNP-ULA is asserted at a new location or withdrawn from an
   old location can be several hundred milliseconds even under optimal
   AS peering arrangements.  This means that packets in flight destined
   to an MNP-ULA route that has recently been changed can be
   (mis)delivered to an old s-ASBR after a Client has moved to a new
   s-ASBR.

   To address this issue, the old s-ASBR can maintain temporary state
   for a "departed" Client that includes an OAL address for the new
   s-ASBR.  The OAL address never changes since ASBRs are fixed
   infrastructure elements that never move.  Hence, packets arriving at
   the old s-ASBR can be forwarded to the new s-ASBR while the BGP
   routing system is still undergoing reconvergence.  Therefore, as long
   as the Client associates with the new s-ASBR before it departs from
   the old s-ASBR (while informing the old s-ASBR of its new location)
   packets in flight during the BGP reconvergence window are
   accommodated without loss.
