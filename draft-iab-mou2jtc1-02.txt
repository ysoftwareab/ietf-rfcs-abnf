Status of this Memo

    This document is an Internet Draft, issued by the Internet Architec-

    This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
    documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
    and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
    working documents as Internet-Drafts.

    Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
    months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents

Abstract

    The IAB has been working toward establishing a liaison relationship
    between the Internet Society and ISO/JTC-1. A liaison with ISO/IEC
    JTC1/SC6 has been offered, and there have been indications that
    liaisons with any of the other SCs will be granted without problems

Internet Draft           liaison with JTC-1/SC6                 May 1994


    as needed.

    Further progress is subject to the preparation and approval of a
    "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) between the two organizations.
    The present document is a prototype of an MOU. It stresses the main
    points of agreement: mutual recognition of standards, information on
    work programs, information sharing and possible collaborative
    efforts.

    In line with JTC1 decisions, this draft MOU covers liaison with SC6.
    The Internet Society looks forward to establishing similar liaisons
    with other appropriate JTC1 subcommittees in the near future and
    expects to use the same MOU for all such liaisons

    This version is a draft. It will have to be reviewed by the members
    of the Internet community and discussed with ISO/IEC JTC1.



1.  Mutual Recognition of Standards

    Both organizations create and publish standards documents for net-
    work protocols and services. They agree that:

    (1) It is often desirable to quote the other's organization work,
        e.g. for establishing standards relating to these external
        specifications.

    (2) That the proper way to quote this work is by straight recogni-
        tion of the other's organization work, so that they can be for-
        mally identified by their original references.

    (3) That the maintenance responsibility for respective standards
        should be retained by the originator.

2.  Information on work programs

    Each organization agrees to inform the other of its work program.

    For the Internet Society this will be done by sending to the ISO/IEC
    JTC-1/SC6 designated point of contact, every six months, a complete
    list of the IETF working groups, including for each of them its
    name, its description, its goals and its expected achievements, as
    well as list of RFCs and drafts relevant to that working group since
    the last reporting period and the milestones met since last report-
    ing period.

    For ISO/IEC JTC-1/SC6 this will be done by <<SOME PROCEDURE TO BE
    DEFINED BY ISO/IEC JTC-1/SC6 ITSELF>>.



3.  Information sharing

    Each organization will inform the other of its publications.

    *   For the Internet Society, this will be accomplished by sending
        every six months to the ISO/JTC-1/SC6 designated point of con-
        tact a list of all the recently published RFCs, together with
        their status in the IETF standardization process. This list is
        regularly published in the Internet Society News which is the
        publication of record for IETF standards work.

    *   For ISO/IEC JTC-1/SC6 this will be done by <<SOME PROCEDURE TO
        BE DEFINED BY ISO/IEC JTC-1/SC6 ITSELF>>.

    Both groups will keep as much as possible of their respective techn-
    ical material on line and freely accessible.

    *   For the Internet Society, this will be accomplished by placing
        all Internet Drafts and Request for Comments in online document
        servers [file servers] that can be anonymously accessed through
        the Internet.

4.  Collaborative efforts

    The working groups of both organizations may in some cases hold
    joint meetings for purposes of technical discussions. Outputs of
    such meetings should be injected back into the processes of both
    organizations.

    The organizations may hold informal joint meetings to look towards
    the future requirements for data networking.  The results should be
    shared with interested working parties in both organizations.

    The results of the working group meetings can be published by both
    organizations. The Internet Society, in particular, will normally
    publish these results through its normal communication channels,
    i.e. either as "internet drafts" or as "RFCs".
