Abstract

   This document defines the text/red MIME sub-type.  The actual RTP
   packetization for this MIME type is specified in RFC 2198.

1. Introduction

   Text is an important component of any multimedia communication
   system.  Like audio, the transport of text can benefit from the use
   of redundancy in order to improve reliability and end-user
   experience.

   RFC 2198 [2] defines an RTP [3] payload format for audio data.  The
   format defined in that document is quite suitable for providing
   redundancy for text, as well as audio.

   RFC 2793 [1] specifies one usage of RFC 2198 and this MIME type for
   the transport of redundant text data.

              Registration of the text/red MIME Sub-Type December 2003


   This memo provides the MIME sub-type registration information for
   text/red.  While this document focuses on the use of this MIME sub-
   type in SDP [6], the application of this MIME sub-type is not
   restricted to SDP.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].


3. IANA Considerations

   One new MIME sub-type is to be registered, as described below:

      MIME media type name: text

      MIME subtype name: RED

      Required parameters:
        rate: the RTP clock rate of the payload carried within the
        RTP packet.  Typically, this rate is 1000, but other rates
        may be specified.

        pt: a comma-separated list of RTP payload types.  Because
        comma is a special character, the list must be a quoted-string
        (enclosed in double quotes).  For static payload types, each
        list element is simply the type number.  For dynamic payload
        types, each list element is a mapping of the dynamic payload
        type number to an embedded MIME content-type specification for
        the payload format corresponding to the dynamic payload type.
        The format of the mapping is:

           dynamic-payload-type "=" content-type

        If the content-type string includes a comma, then the
        content-type string MUST be a quoted-string.  If the content-
        type string does not include a comma, it MAY still be quoted.
        Since it is part of the list which must itself be a quoted-
        string, that means the quotation marks MUST be quoted with
        backslash quoting as specified in RFC 2045 [5].  If the content-
        type string itself contains a quoted-string, then the
        requirement for backslash quoting is recursively applied.

      Optional parameters: ptime, maxptime

      Encoding considerations:
        This type is only defined for transfer via RTP.

      Security considerations: Refer to section 4.

      Interoperability considerations: none

      Published specification: RFC 2198

      Applications which use this media type:
        Text streaming and conferencing tools.

      Additional information: none

4. Mapping to SDP Parameters

   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [11], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the RFC 2198 in a text session,
   the mapping is as follows:

   -  The MIME type ("text") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   -  The MIME subtype (RED) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap"
      as the encoding name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST be
      set equal to the text payload formats carried as primary encoding.


   -  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime"
      and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

   -  The pt parameter is mapped to an a=fmtp attribute by eliminating
      the parameter name (pt) and changing the commas to slashes.  For
      example, 'pt="101,102"' maps to 'a=fmtp:99 101/102'

   An example of SDP is:

       m=text 11000 RTP/AVP 98 100
       a=rtpmap:98 t140/1000
       a=rtpmap:100 red/1000

       a=fmtp:100 98/98

5. Security Considerations

   The security considerations listed in RFC 2198 apply.  Further, it
   should be understood that text data, perhaps even more so than audio
   data, is susceptible to unwanted modification that may lead to
   undesired results.
