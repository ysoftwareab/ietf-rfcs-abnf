    A DANE Record and DNSSEC Authentication Chain Extension for TLS
                draft-ietf-tls-dnssec-chain-extension-03

Abstract

   This draft describes a new TLS extension for transport of a DNS
   record set serialized with the DNSSEC signatures needed to
   authenticate that record set.  The intent of this proposal is to
   allow TLS clients to perform DANE authentication of a TLS server
   certificate without needing to perform additional DNS record lookups.
   It will typically not be used for general DNSSEC validation of TLS
   endpoint names.

2.  Introduction

   This draft describes a new TLS [RFC5246] extension for transport of a
   DNS record set serialized with the DNSSEC signatures [RFC4034] needed
   to authenticate that record set.  The intent of this proposal is to
   allow TLS clients to perform DANE authentication [RFC6698] of a TLS
   server certificate without performing additional DNS record lookups
   and incurring the associated latency penalty.  It also provides the

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension             March 2017


   ability to avoid potential problems with TLS clients being unable to
   look up DANE records because of an interfering or broken middlebox on
   the path between the client and a DNS server.  And lastly, it allows
   a TLS client to validate DANE records itself without necessarily
   needing access to a validating DNS resolver to which it has a secure
   connection.  It will typically not be used for general DNSSEC
   validation of endpoint names, but is more appropriate for validation
   of DANE TLSA records.

   This mechanism is useful for TLS applications that need to address
   the problems described above, typically web browsers or VoIP and XMPP
   applications.  It may not be relevant for many other applications.
   For example, SMTP MTAs are usually located in data centers, may
   tolerate extra DNS lookup latency, are on servers where it is easier
   to provision a validating resolver, or are less likely to experience
   traffic interference from misconfigured middleboxes.  Furthermore,
   SMTP MTAs usually employ Opportunistic Security [RFC7435], in which
   the presence of the DNS TLSA records is used to determine whether to
   enforce an authenticated TLS connection.  Hence DANE authentication
   of SMTP MTAs [RFC7672] will typically not use this mechanism.

   The extension described here allows a TLS client to request in the
   ClientHello message that the DNS authentication chain be returned in
   the (extended) ServerHello message.  If the server is configured for
   DANE authentication, then it performs the appropriate DNS queries,
   builds the authentication chain, and returns it to the client.  The
   server will usually use a previously cached authentication chain, but
   it will need to rebuild it periodically as described in Section 5.
   The client then authenticates the chain using a pre-configured trust
   anchor.

   This specification is based on Adam Langley's original proposal for
   serializing DNSSEC authentication chains and delivering them in an
   X.509 certificate extension [I-D.agl-dane-serializechain].  It
   modifies the approach by using wire format DNS records in the
   serialized data (assuming that the data will be prepared and consumed
   by a DNS-specific library), and by using a TLS extension to deliver
   the data.

   As described in the DANE specification [RFC6698], this procuedure
   applies to the DANE authentication of X.509 certificates.  Other
   credentials may be supported, as needed, in the future.

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension             March 2017


3.1.  Protocol, TLS 1.2

   A client MAY include an extension of type "dnssec_chain" in the
   (extended) ClientHello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension
   MUST be empty.

   Servers receiving a "dnssec_chain" extension in the ClientHello, and
   which are capable of being authenticated via DANE, MAY return a
   serialized authentication chain in the extended ServerHello message,
   using the format described below.  If a server is unable to return an
   authentication chain, or does not wish to return an authentication
   chain, it does not include a dnssec_chain extension.  As with all TLS
   extensions, if the server does not support this extension it will not
   return any authentication chain.

   A client must not be able to force a server to perform lookups on
   arbitrary domain names using this mechanism.  Therefore, a server
   MUST NOT construct chains for domain names other than its own.

3.2.  Protocol, TLS 1.3

   A client MAY include an extension of type "dnssec_chain" in the
   ClientHello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension MUST be
   empty.

   Servers receiving a "dnssec_chain" extension in the ClientHello, and
   which are capable of being authenticated via DANE, SHOULD return a
   serialized authentication chain in the Certificate message associated
   with the end entity certificate being validated, using the format
   described below.  The authentication chain will be an extension to
   the certificate_list to which the certificate being authenticated
   belongs.

   The extension protocol behavior otherwise follows that specified for
   TLS version 1.2.

3.3.  Raw Public Keys

   [RFC7250] specifies the use of raw public keys for both server and
   client authentication in TLS 1.2.  It points out that in cases where
   raw public keys are being used, code for certificate path validation
   is not required.  However, DANE, when used in conjunction with the
   dnssec_chain extension, provides a mechanism for securely binding a
   raw public key to a named entity in the DNS, and when using DANE for
   authentication a raw key may be validated using a path chaining back
   to a DNSSEC trust root.  This has the added benefit of mitigating an
   unknown key share attack, as described in [I-D.barnes-dane-uks],
   since it effectively augments the raw public key with the server's



Shore, et al.          Expires September 28, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension             March 2017


   name and provides a means to commit both the server and the client to
   using that binding.

   The UKS attack is possible in situations in which the association
   between a domain name and a public key is not tightly bound, as in
   the case in DANE in which a client either ignores the name in
   certificate (as specified in [RFC7671] or there is no attestation of
   trust outside of the DNS.  The vulnerability arises in the following
   situations:

   o  If the client does not verify the identity in the server's
      certificate (as recommended in Section 5.1 of [RFC7671]), then an
      attacker can induce the client to accept an unintended identity
      for the server,

   o  If the client allows the use of raw public keys in TLS, then it
      will not receive any indication of the server's identity in the
      TLS channel, and is thus unable to check that the server's
      identity is as intended.

   The mechanism for conveying DNSSEC validation chains described in
   this document results in a commitment by both parties, via the TLS
   handshake, to a domain name which has been validated as belonging to
   the owner name.

   The mechanism for encoding DNSSEC authentication chains in a TLS
   extension, as described in this document, is not limited to public
   keys encapsulated in X.509 containers but MAY be applied to raw
   public keys and other representations, as well.

3.4.  DNSSEC Authentication Chain Data

   The "extension_data" field of the "dnssec_chain" extension MUST
   contain a DNSSEC Authentication Chain encoded in the following form:


             opaque AuthenticationChain<0..2^16-1>

   The AuthenticationChain structure is composed of a sequence of
   uncompressed wire format DNS resource record sets (RRset) and
   corresponding signatures (RRsig) records.  The record sets and
   signatures are presented in the order returned by the DNS server
   queried by the TLS server, although they MAY be returned in
   validation order, starting at the target DANE record, followed by the
   DNSKEY and DS record sets for each intervening DNS zone up to a trust
   anchor chosen by the server, typically the DNS root.

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension             March 2017


   This sequence of native DNS wire format records enables easier
   generation of the data structure on the server and easier
   verification of the data on client by means of existing DNS library
   functions.  However this document describes the data structure in
   sufficient detail that implementers if they desire can write their
   own code to do this.

   Each RRset in the chain is composed of a sequence of wire format DNS
   resource records.  The format of the resource record is described in
   RFC 1035 [RFC1035], Section 3.2.1.  The resource records SHOULD be
   presented in the canonical form and ordering as described in RFC 4034
   [RFC4034].


             RR(i) = owner | type | class | TTL | RDATA length | RDATA

   RRs within the RRset MAY be ordered canonically, by treating the
   RDATA portion of each RR as a left-justified unsigned octet sequence
   in which the absence of an octet sorts before a zero octet.

   The RRsig record is in DNS wire format as described in RFC 4034
   [RFC4034], Section 3.1.  The signature portion of the RDATA, as
   described in the same section, is the following:


             signature = sign(RRSIG_RDATA | RR(1) | RR(2)... )

   where, RRSIG_RDATA is the wire format of the RRSIG RDATA fields with
   the Signer's Name field in canonical form and the signature field
   excluded.

   The first RRset in the chain MUST contain the DANE records being
   presented.  The subsequent RRsets MUST be a sequence of DNSKEY and DS
   RRsets, starting with a DNSKEY RRset.  Each RRset MUST authenticate
   the preceding RRset:

   o  A DNSKEY RRset must include the DNSKEY RR containing the public
      key used to verify the previous RRset.

   o  For a DS RRset, the set of key hashes MUST overlap with the
      preceding set of DNSKEY records.

   In addition, a DNSKEY RRset followed by a DS RRset MUST be self-
   signed, in the sense that its RRSIG MUST verify under one of the keys
   in the DNSKEY RRSET.

   The final DNSKEY RRset in the authentication chain, containing the
   trust anchor may be omitted.  If omitted, the client MUST verify that

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension             March 2017


   the key tag and owner name in the final RRSIG record correspond to a
   trust anchor.  There may however be reason to include the trust
   anchor RRset and signature if clients are expected to use RFC5011
   compliant key rollover functions inband via the chain data.  In that
   case, they will need to periodically inspect flags (revocation and
   secure entry point flags) on the trust anchor DNSKEY RRset.

   For example, for an HTTPS server at www.example.com, where there are
   zone cuts at "com." and "example.com.", the AuthenticationChain
   structure would comprise the following RRsets and signatures (the
   data field of the records are omitted here for brevity):


             _443._tcp.www.example.com. TLSA
             RRSIG(_443._tcp.www.example.com. TLSA)
             example.com. DNSKEY
             RRSIG(example.com. DNSKEY)
             example.com. DS
             RRSIG(example.com. DS)
             com. DNSKEY
             RRSIG(com. DNSKEY)
             com. DS
             RRSIG(com. DS)
             . DNSKEY
             RRSIG(. DNSKEY)

   Names that are aliased via CNAME and/or DNAME records may involve
   multiple branches of the DNS tree.  In this case the authentication
   chain structure will be composed of a sequence of these multiple
   intersecting branches.  DNAME chains should omit unsigned CNAME
   records that may have been synthesized in the response from a DNS
   resolver.  Wildcard DANE records will need to include the wildcard
   name, and negative proof (i.e.  NSEC or NSEC3 records) that no closer
   name exists MUST be included.

         A CNAME example:

         _443._tcp.www.example.com.   IN   CNAME    ca.example.net.
         ca.example.net.              IN   TLSA     2 0 1 ...

         Here the authentication chain structure is composed of two
         consecutive chains, one for _443._tcp.www.example.com/CNAME
         and one for ca.example.net/TLSA. The second chain can omit
         the record sets at the end that overlap with the first.

         TLS DNSSEC chain components:

         _443._tcp.www.example.com. CNAME
         RRSIG(_443._tcp.www.example.com. CNAME)
         example.com. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(example.com. DNSKEY)
         example.com. DS
         RRSIG(example.com. DS)
         com. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(com. DNSKEY)
         com. DS
         RRSIG(com. DS)
         . DNSKEY
         RRSIG(. DNSKEY)

         ca.example.net. TLSA
         RRSIG(ca.example.net. TLSA)
         example.net. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(example.net. DNSKEY)
         example.net. DS
         RRSIG(example.net. DS)
         net. DNSKEY
         RRSIG(net. DNSKEY)
         net. DS
         RRSIG(net. DS)


   Note as well that if a user has a specific TLSA record for port 443,
   and a different wildcard covering other ports, attackers MUST NOT be
   able to substitute the wildcard TLSA RRset for the more specific one
   for port 443.  DNSSEC wildcards must not be confused with the X.509
   wildcards.

4.  Construction of Serialized Authentication Chains

   This section describes a possible procedure for the server to use to
   build the serialized DNSSEC chain.




Shore, et al.          Expires September 28, 2017               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension             March 2017


   When the goal is to perform DANE authentication [RFC6698] of the
   server's X.509 certificate, the DNS record set to be serialized is a
   TLSA record set corresponding to the server's domain name.

   The domain name of the server MUST be that included in the TLS
   server_name extension [RFC6066] when present.  If the server_name
   extension is not present, or if the server does not recognize the
   provided name and wishes to proceed with the handshake rather than to
   abort the connection, the server uses the domain name associated with
   the server IP address to which the connection has been established.

   The TLSA record to be queried is constructed by prepending the _port
   and _transport labels to the domain name as described in [RFC6698],
   where "port" is the port number associated with the TLS server.  The
   transport is "tcp" for TLS servers, and "udp" for DTLS servers.  The
   port number label is the left-most label, followed by the transport,
   followed by the base domain name.

   The components of the authentication chain are built by starting at
   the target record set and its corresponding RRSIG.  Then traversing
   the DNS tree upwards towards the trust anchor zone (normally the DNS
   root), for each zone cut, the DNSKEY and DS RRsets and their
   signatures are added.  If DNS responses messages contain any domain
   names utilizing name compression [RFC1035], then they must be
   uncompressed.

   In the future, proposed DNS protocol enhancements, such as the EDNS
   Chain Query extension [RFC7901] may offer easy ways to obtain all of
   the chain data in one transaction with an upstream DNSSEC aware
   recursive server.

5.  Caching and Regeneration of the Authentication Chain

   DNS records have Time To Live (TTL) parameters, and DNSSEC signatures
   have validity periods (specifically signature expiration times).
   After the TLS server constructs the serialized authentication chain,
   it SHOULD cache and reuse it in multiple TLS connection handshakes.
   However, it MUST refresh and rebuild the chain as TTLs and signature
   validity periods dictate.  A server implementation could carefully
   track these parameters and requery component records in the chain
   correspondingly.  Alternatively, it could be configured to rebuild
   the entire chain at some predefined periodic interval that does not
   exceed the DNS TTLs or signature validity periods of the component
   records in the chain.

Internet-Draft         TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension             March 2017


6.  Verification

   A TLS client making use of this specification, and which receives a
   DNSSEC authentication chain extension from a server, SHOULD use this
   information to perform DANE authentication of the server certificate.
   In order to do this, it uses the mechanism specified by the DNSSEC
   protocol [RFC4035].  This mechanism is sometimes implemented in a
   DNSSEC validation engine or library.

   If the authentication chain is correctly verified, the client then
   performs DANE authentication of the server according to the DANE TLS
   protocol [RFC6698], and the additional protocol requirements outlined
   in [RFC7671].

7.  Trust Anchor Maintenance

   The trust anchor may change periodically, e.g. when the operator of
   the trust anchor zone performs a DNSSEC key rollover.  Managed key
   rollovers typically use a process that can be tracked by verifiers
   allowing them to automatically update their trust anchors, as
   described in [RFC5011].  TLS clients using this specification are
   also expected to use such a mechanism to keep their trust anchors
   updated.  Some operating systems may have a system-wide service to
   maintain and keep the root trust anchor up to date.  In such cases,
   the TLS client application could simply reference that as its trust
   anchor, periodically checking whether it has changed.

8.  Mandating use of this extension

   A TLS server certificate MAY mandate the use of this extension by
   means of the X.509 TLS Feature Extension described in [RFC7633].
   This X.509 certificate extension, when populated with the
   dnssec_chain TLS extension identifier, indicates to the client that
   the server must deliver the authentication chain when asked to do so.
   (The X.509 TLS Feature Extension is the same mechanism used to
   deliver other mandatory signals, such as OCSP "must staple"
   assertions.)

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the normatively referenced RFCs (1035,
   4034, 4035, 5246, 6066, 6698, 7633, 7671) all pertain to this
   extension.  Since the server is delivering a chain of DNS records and
   signatures to the client, it MUST rebuild the chain in accordance
   with TTL and signature expiration of the chain components as
   described in Section 5.  TLS clients need roughly accurate time in
   order to properly authenticate these signatures.  This could be
   achieved by running a time synchronization protocol like NTP

   [RFC5905] or SNTP [RFC5905], which are already widely used today.
   TLS clients MUST support a mechanism to track and rollover the trust
   anchor key, or be able to avail themselves of a service that does
   this, as described in Section 7.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This extension requires the registration of a new value in the TLS
   ExtensionsType registry.  The value requested from IANA is 53.  If
   the draft is adopted by the WG, the authors expect to make an early
   allocation request as specified in [RFC7120].

11.  Acknowledgments

   Many thanks to Adam Langley for laying the groundwork for this
   extension.  The original idea is his but our acknowledgment in no way
   implies his endorsement.  This document also benefited from
   discussions with and review from the following people: Viktor
   Dukhovni, Daniel Kahn Gillmor, Jeff Hodges, Allison Mankin, Patrick
   McManus, Rick van Rein, Gowri Visweswaran, Duane Wessels, Nico
   Williams, and Paul Wouters.
