Too Many Requests Response Code for the Constrained Application Protocol
                    draft-ietf-core-too-many-reqs-01

Abstract

   A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) server can experience
   temporary overload because one or more clients are sending requests
   to the server at a higher rate than the server is capable or willing
   to handle.  This document defines a new CoAP Response Code for a
   server to indicate that a client should reduce the rate of requests.

1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] Response Codes
   are used by a CoAP server to indicate the result of the attempt to
   understand and satisfy a request sent by a client.

   CoAP Response Codes are similar to the HTTP [RFC7230] Status Codes
   and many codes are shared with similar semantics by both CoAP and
   HTTP.  HTTP has the code "429" registered for "Too Many Requests"
   [RFC6585].  This document registers a CoAP Response Code "4.29" for
   similar purpose and also defines use of the Max-Age option to
   indicate when a client can try the request again.

   The 4.29 code is similar to the 5.03 "Service Unavailable" [RFC7252]
   code in a way that the 5.03 code can also be used by a server to
   signal an overload situation.  However the 4.29 code indicates that
   the too frequent requests from the requesting client are the reason
   for the overload.

2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Readers should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed
   in [RFC7252].

3.  CoAP Server Behavior

   If a CoAP server is unable to serve a client that is sending CoAP
   request messages more often than the server is capable or willing to
   handle, the server SHOULD respond to the request(s) with the Response
   Code 4.29, "Too Many Requests".  The Max-Age option is used to

   indicate the number of seconds after which the server assumes it is
   OK for the client to retry the request.

   An action result payload (see Section 5.5.1 in [RFC7252]) can be sent
   by the server to give more guidance to the client, e.g., about the
   details of the overload situation.

4.  CoAP Client Behavior

   If a client receives the 4.29 Response Code from a CoAP server to a
   request, it SHOULD NOT send the same request to the server before the
   time indicated in the Max-Age option has passed.

   A client MUST NOT rely on a server being able to send the 4.29
   Response Code in an overload situation because an overloaded server
   may not be able to reply to all requests at all.

5.  Security Considerations

   Replying to CoAP requests with a Response Code consumes resources
   from a server.  For a server under attack it may be more appropriate
   to simply drop requests without responding.

   If a CoAP reply with the Too Many Requests Response Code is not
   authenticated and integrity protected, an attacker can attempt to
   spoof a reply and make the client wait for an extended period of time
   before trying again.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following Response Code in the
   "CoRE Parameters Registry", "CoAP Response Codes" sub-registry:

   o  Response Code: 4.29

   o  Description: Too Many Requests

   o  Reference: [[This document]]
