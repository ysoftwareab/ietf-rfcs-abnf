Internet-Draft                Feed License                   August 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines how Atom feed publishers can associate licenses
   with the metadata of a feed or entry.  Licenses associated using
   these mechanisms might be machine readable and are intended to
   communicate the various rights and obligations others may have with
   regards to the associated Atom Feed or Entry.

1.1.  Experimental Status

   Associating licenses with feeds and entries using the mechanisms
   defined by this specification is currently considered to be largely
   experimental.  While it is a common practice for feed publishers to
   associate licenses with syndicated content, there are still very few
   feed consumers that utilize such metadata.  As it is not yet certain
   how these mechanisms will be used, implementations and feedback are
   encouraged.

   It must also be noted that licenses associated with feeds or entries
   using these mechanisms are advisory and are not, by themselves,
   legally binding.  Nor can a license associated with a feed or entry
   restrict or forbid access to, redistribution, aggregation, caching
   and display of those items by third party intermediaries such as
   search engines and so-called "online aggregators".

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   The term "link relation" used in this specification refers to the
   value of the Atom link elements "rel" attribute as defined in section
   4.2.7.2 of [RFC4287].

   The term "entry content" refers to the value of the content element
   as defined in section 4.13 of [RFC4287] and to any resources
   identified by the content element "src" attribute.

   For feed elements, the term "metadata" refers to the values and
   attributes of the author, category, contributor, generator, icon, id,
   link, logo, rights, subtitle, title, and updated elements (as defined
   by [RFC4287]), as well as all extension elements appearing as
   children of the feed element and all elements appearing as children
   of the author and contributor elements.  It also includes the
   selection and arrangement of entry elements contained by the feed but

   not the metadata or content of the entries themselves.

   For entry elements, "metadata" refers to the values and attributes of
   the author, category, content, contributor, id, link, published,
   rights, source, summary, title, and updated elements, as well as all
   extension elements appearing as children of the entry element and all
   elements appearing as children of the author and contributor
   elements.


2.  The "license" link relation

   The "license" link relation associates a license with a feed or
   entry.

   Feed and entry elements MAY contain any number of "license" link
   relations but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same
   combination of href and type attribute values.  The IRI specified by
   the link's 'href' attribute SHOULD be dereferenceable to return a
   representation of the license.  The license representation MAY be
   machine readable.

   "License" link relations appearing within a feed MUST apply to the
   metadata of the containing feed element only and do not extend over
   the metadata or content of any contained entries.

   Entry content might include or reference material from other sources.
   Licenses associated with an entry MUST NOT be assumed to cover such
   material.  Implementations cannot necessarily trust that publishers
   have the right to license material claimed to be covered by any
   associated license.  Care should be taken when making decisions based
   on the referenced license.

   Feeds and entries can be dual-license by using multiple "license"
   link relations specifying different href attribute values.  For
   instance, if an entry specifies "license" links identifying both a
   Creative Commons License and the General Public License (GPL), the
   entry is considered to be dual-licensed as either Creative Commons OR
   GPL as opposed to Creative Commons AND GPL.

   If multiple license link relations are specified, each SHOULD contain
   a title attribute specifying a human-readable label for the license.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">

3.  Security Considerations

   When "license" link relations are used in Atom documents, the
   security considerations specified in [RFC4287] Section 8 apply.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type to be
   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relations as defined by
   [RFC4287].
       Attribute Value: license
       Description: Specifies the IRI of a license associated with
                    the containing feed, entry or source element.
                    Expected display characteristics: None
       Security considerations: When "license" link relations are used
                    in Atom documents, the security considerations for
                    handling links in Atom documents apply.
