Abstract 
 
Certain link-layer technologies are capable of providing various link 
status information to the IP module. Indicating the status of the link, 
such as connected or disconnected, and the link identifier can help the 
IP module make intelligent decisions regarding configuration changes. 
It has been identified that such information can be used as hints for 
network attachment detection purposes. This draft provides a  
non-exhaustive catalogue of such hints from well-known link-layer 
technologies. Furthermore, a high-level abstraction is defined to 
categorize such hints.

1.0  Introduction 
 
   It is not an uncommon occurrence for a host to change its point-of 
   attachment to the network. This can happen due to mobile usage 
   (e.g., a mobile phone moving among base stations) or nomadic usage 
   (e.g., road-warrior case). 
    
   Each time a host changes its point-of attachment, it is possible 
   that it will also have to change its IP-layer configurations, such 
   as its IP address and default gateway information. In order to make 
   these changes, the IP module has to detect the new network 
   attachment, realize that the old configuration is no longer valid 
   and obtain the new configuration parameters. The network detection 
   phase can usually use network-layer indications such as a change in 
   the advertised prefixes. But generally reliance on such indications 
   does not yield rapid detection, since these indications are not 
   readily available upon a link change. It has been identified that 
   receiving explicit hints from the link-layer would expedite the 
   detection process. The link-layer indicating that the host has 
   established a new connection can be used as a hint to further probe

   the network for a possible configuration change. Such an indication 
   cannot be used to positively determine the need for a configuration 
   change as it might very well be the case that the host is still 
   connected to the same IP subnet despite the link change. For 
   example, there might be several IEEE 802.11b access points connected 
   to the same access router. Moving among these access points does not 
   warrant any IP-layer configuration change. This is why the link-
   layer hints should be used as "advisory-only" unless stated 
   otherwise. 
    
   In order to enable an enhanced network attachment detection scheme, 
   we need to identify types of link-layer hints that can be 
   realistically expected from various access technologies. The 
   objective of this draft is to provide a catalogue of existing link-
   layer hints in various architectures. Later, this catalogue is used 
   to define an abstraction for these hints. The movement detection 
   schemes should be able to incorporate these hints in their abstract 
   form for simplicity. Furthermore, this abstraction should enable the 
   link-layer developers to align their implementations according to 
   the needs of IP. This is not an API design, although the abstraction 
   can be used to define one. 
    
   The document limits itself to the minimum set of link-layer hints 
   that are necessary for detecting network attachment. These hints are 
   considered with hosts in mind, although they may also be available 
   on the network side (e.g., on the access router).

3.0  Link-layer Hints in Various Systems 
 
   This section provides an overview of various architectures and 
   discusses associated link-layer hints.  
 
 
3.1. GPRS 
 
   Multi-interface terminals are changing the face of wireless IP 
   connectivity and GPRS [GPRS] is being one of the most pervasive 
   types of radio link for enabling multi-technology access to the 
   Internet.  
         
   GPRS is an enhancement to the GSM data transmission architecture and 
   capabilities, designed to allow for packet switching in user data 
   transmission within the GPRS network as well as for higher quality 
   of service for the IP traffic of Mobile Terminals with external 
   Packets Data Networks (PDN) such as the Internet or corporate LANs.

[Page 7]                       L2 Hints                   October 2003 
                                    
   The GPRS architecture consists of a Radio Access Network and a 
   packet domain Core Network. 
    
   - The GPRS Radio Access Network is composed of Mobile Terminals, a 
   Base Station Subsystem (BSS) and Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSN). 
   The BSS is made up of radio cells called Base Transceiver Stations 
   (BTS) served under the control of Base Station Controllers (BSC). 
   So-called Routing Areas are formed by the subdivision of BSCs. Each 
   SGSN in the GPRS architecture controls a set of RAs; 
    
   - An IP Core Network that acts as the transport backbone of user 
   datagrams between SGSNs and Gateway GPRS Support Nodes (GGSN). The 
   GGSN ensures the GPRS IP core network connectivity with external 
   networks, such as Internet or Local Area Networks. 
    
   From the point of view prevailing in detecting network attachment, 
   the GPRS access network will be only seen as providing layer 1-2 
   reachability even if it is able to provide IP connectivity alone. 
 
 
3.1.1.  Network Reference Model 
 
   Most of the hints described in this document come from messages 
   exchanged on top of the Logical Link Control protocol (LLC) running 
   between the Mobile Terminal and the SGSN. The messages are part of 
   the GPRS Mobility Management (GMM) and Session Management (SM) 
   protocols and ensure functionalities such as GPRS attach, detach, 
   PDP Context activation and deactivation, Routing Area update.

3.1.2.  Link-layer Hints 
 
   In GPRS networks, only network attachment/detachment and subsequent 
   PDP context changing events will directly impact the IP 
   configurations, hence should be used as link-layer hints by IP. 
   Other events such as routing area and cell change do not directly 
   imply potential configuration change. More details on those 
   secondary types of events can be found in Appendix A.

   A GPRS attach is made to the SGSN. The procedure is attempted 
   whenever a GPRS-enabled Mobile Terminal is being switched on. The 
   attachment can also take place at any time while the MT is switched 
   on, for example following a detach forced by the network. The MT 
   provides its identity during the attach request to the network in 
   the form of a so-called Packet Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity  
   (P-TMSI). If the MT has no valid P-TMSI, it provides its IMSI.  
    
   Before the MT becomes GPRS attached, it scans for available GPRS 
   networks, as well as acquires the identities of their cells in the 
   covered area. It is also possible for the MT to obtain the radio 
   capabilities of these cells.  
              
   When a MT has performed the GPRS attach, it becomes in READY state. 
   In this state, the MT is reachable (using the logical link layer - 
   LLC) by the GPRS Radio Access Point called the SGSN. Otherwise, its 
   state is said to be IDLE. During the IDLE state, no IP level 
   communication is possible with an external network, such as 
   Internet. The SGSN identifies the logical link with the MT by the 
   Temporary Logical Link Identifier (TLLI) it derives from the P-TMSI 
   that was assigned to the MT. It has to be noted that the MT or SGSN 
   may initiate a detach procedure (Mobile or Network Initiated 
   Detach). The MT returns from READY to IDLE STATE upon detachment. 
 
   The MT is actually considered GPRS attached when it has received an 
   "Attach Accept" message from the SGSN. This can be a hint to the 
   network-layer of the Mobile Node that a GPRS Network has been found 
   and that the GPRS interface of the MN is attached to it.  
           
   The MT is considered detached from the GPRS Network when it has 
   received/sent a "Detach Accept message" from/to the SGSN. This is an 
   indication that the link-layer connectivity is being lost.  
           
   The "Detach Accept" message is also preceded by a "Detach Request" 
   message from the side initiating the detachment procedure. This 
   message is a hint that a detachment from the GPRS network is about 
   to take place. The network-layer could then anticipate the loss of 
   connectivity.  
 
   The "Attach Accept" message comes along with an update of the Mobile 
   Terminal Mobility Management context held at the GMM/MM level. This 
   message contains: 
    
   - The Packet Temporary Mobile Station Identifier (P-TMSI). The P-
   TMSI is a temporary IMSI allocated by the GPRS network upon attach 
   (if no P-TMSI was already present). It is used for subscriber 
   location hiding purpose in substitution to the IMSI. 
   - The current Cell Identity (CI)  
   - The current Routing Area Identity (RAI) which identifies the 
   serving SGSN  
   - The ciphering algorithm, key (Kc) and sequence number (CKSN)

   Once the GPRS MT is attached, the attached network information can 
   be sent to it via the "MM information" message that contains: 
    
   - The network name known as Public Land Mobile Network ID in 3GPP 
   terminology  
   - Network registration type (Home or Roaming)  
 
   A MN that wants to establish IP-level connections through the GPRS 
   MT should first request the GPRS network to settle the necessary 
   soft state mechanism (GPRS tunneling protocol) between its serving 
   SGSN and the GGSN corresponding to the APN specified in the PDP 
   Context parameters. Only after this tunneling mechanism takes place 
   can the MN's IP packets be forwarded to/from its remote IP peers. 
   The process by which this is made possible is designated as a PDP 
   Context Request. 
              
   The aim of this function is also to provide IP-level configuration 
   on top of the GPRS link-layer attachment, in order for the MN to get 
   IP reachability with external networks, such as Internet. The 
   establishment of a PDP context is partially based on link-layer 
   characteristics negotiated between the MT and the GPRS network (SGSN 
   and GGSN). These characteristics include the QoS profile that will 
   be guaranteed by the SGSN and GGSN (e.g., maximum delay, link 
   reliability, peak and mean throughputs). When the MT requests a PDP 
   context, it selects a Network Service Access Point Identifier 
   (NSAPI) that it sends to the SGSN with the request. The NSAPI is 
   sent (as part of the PDP Context request message) on top the Logical 
   Link Control layer identified for that MT by the TLLI. In this way, 
   the SGSN is able to uniquely identify the PDP context. 
              
   A PDP context Activation procedure can also be initiated by the GGSN  
   (Network-requested PDP Context Activation) but this alternative is 
   not likely to happen so often.   
    
   The network may also decide to modify an existing PDP Context with a 
   given MN at any time. Such a modification might be prompted by the 
   MN's serving SGSN when it estimates that the negotiated QoS profile 
   can no longer be respected. For instance, the GPRS Network might 
   temporarily not be able to guarantee the contracted delay, in which 
   case it would force the related PDP context parameter to be 
   renegotiated. Note that, a MT can decide not to accept such an 
   update of its PDP context, in which case it should start a PDP 
   context deactivation procedure. Furthermore, a PDP context may be 
   deleted at any time at the request of the MT or the network. After a 
   PDP context is deleted, the MT returns to simply attached state 
   (READY STATE). Finally, a Mobile Terminal can hold several PDP 
   contexts, each corresponding to a different NSAPI.

   A PDP context is considered activated on the MT side as soon as an  
   "Activate PDP Context Accept" message has been received from the  
   GGSN. The reception of this message can be considered as a hint that  
   the GPRS network will be providing a certain link-layer quality-of  
   service for which parameters (e.g., delay, reliability, throughput) 
   are included with the messages described below.  
              
   When the network is about to modify a PDP Context, it informs the MT 
   by sending a "Modify PDP Context Request" message. This can also be 
   an indication at the MN's network-layer that the link-layer 
   characteristics on the GPRS attachment are about to change. The MN 
   could then be able to anticipate such a change, which would likely 
   be a drop or an increase of service quality. The "Modify PDP Context 
   Accept" message confirms the modification and is a hint that the 
   initially negotiated PDP context characteristics are no longer 
   valid.  
              
   A "Deactivate PDP Context Request" message is sent by the MN or 
   received from the SGSN depending on which side has initiated the 
   deactivation procedure. The transmission or reception of this 
   message can serve as a hint that the IP configuration of the MN's 
   GPRS interface or one of its IP configuration (in case multiple PDP 
   Contexts are present on the MT), is about to be deleted. This could 
   help the MN anticipate the coming loss of IP attachment. A 
   "Deactivate PDP Context Accept" sent or received by the MT is a 
   confirmation that the PDP context is being deleted.  
              
   The "Activate PDP Context Accept" message comes along with a 
   modification of the GMM context that contains the following 
   information:  
    
   - The TI (transaction identifier) associated to the procedure of 
   activating a PDP context. It consists of the NSAPI generated by the 
   MT for that PDP context and an operation identifier, 
   - The IP address for that PDP context, 
   - The QoS Profile negotiated with the network, 
   - The Radio Priority level for data transmission.

3.2. 3GPP2 
 
   3GPP2 (cdma2000) packet data services provide mobile users wide area 
   high-speed access to packet switched networks. 3GPP2 consists of 
   multiple radio access technologies, namely 1x EV, 1x EV-DO and 1x 
   EV-DV, where the order shows the evolution of technology in the 
   industry. 1x Evolution Data Only (1x EV-DO) and 1x Evolution Data-
   Voice (1x EV-DV) are enhanced air interface technologies that are 
   optimized for higher data rates. 
 
   The aforementioned 3GPP2 technologies share a common core network 
   infrastructure which enables easy transition to enhanced air 
   interface technologies. 3GPP2 networks use the Point-to-Point 
   Protocol (PPP) as the link-layer protocol between the mobile node 
   and the network access server. Hence, link-layer mechanisms are 
   pretty consistent across all air interface technologies. Unless 
   specifically called out, all link-layer mechanisms specified in this 
   document apply to all 3GPP2 air interface technologies.

3.2.1.  Network Reference Model 
 
   Some of the major components of the 3GPP2 packet network 
   architecture (see Figure 3) consist of: 
 
   - Mobile Node (also known as Mobile Station or Access Terminal in 
   3GPP2), which allows mobile access to packet-switched networks over 
   a wireless connection, 
   - Radio Access Network, which consists of the Base Station 
   Transceivers (BTS), Base Station Controllers (BSC), and the Packet 
   Control Function (PCF), 
   - Network Access Server known as the Packet Data Switching Node 
   (PDSN). The PDSN also serves as the Foreign Agent (FA), in the case 
   of Mobile IP service.

                Figure 3. Packet Network Reference Model 
 
 
   Figure 4 shows the hierarchical relationship between the RAN, 
   PDSN/FA and HA. The control and bearer interfaces between the BSC 
   and PCF are known as the A9 and A8 interface respectively, while the 
   control and bearer interfaces between PCF and PDSN are known as the 
   A11 and A10 interfaces respectively. Note that, the A11/A10 
   interface is also known as the R-P interface (for RAN-PDSN 
   interface). The A9 and A11 interfaces are used to establish A8 and 
   A10 connections. The A8 and A10 connections are used to tunnel link 
   layer data (PPP frames) between the BSC and PDSN.

   A PCF controls one or more BSCs. The area served by each PCF is 
   identified by the Access Network Identifier (ANID). This is referred 
   to as the SUBNET ID in the 1x EV-DO system. Any given BSC is 
   associated with one and only one PCF. The combination of BSC and PCF 
   is also known as the RAN. Each PCF can communicate with one or more 
   PDSNs. However, for a given mobile user, the PCF typically 
   establishes a connection with a specific PDSN.

   Link-layer-related (e.g., handover) information is provided by the 
   RAN to the MS via 3GPP2 overhead signaling messages broadcast over 
   the air interface. 
    
   A number of other important components of the architecture that 
   enable call setup (such as the MSC, HLR, AC and/or AAA servers) are 
   left out for the sake of simplicity. None of these components have a 
   direct impact on the discussion of link-layer hints. 
    
 
3.2.2.  Link-layer Hints 
 
   While a PPP connection is in ESTABLISHED state at the MN and PDSN, 
   the packet data service state at the MN can be in ACTIVE or DORMANT 
   state. In the ACTIVE state, all the bearers between the MN and the 
   PDSN are in the established state. In the DORMANT state, the radio 
   link bearer and the A8 connection are torn down to conserve radio 
   resources. However, the A10 bearer still remains connected, and the 
   PPP state is maintained both at the MN and PDSN. 
    
   MN transitions from DORMANT to ACTIVE state when the MN has some 
   data to send or the network (PDSN) has data to send to the MN. When 
   a MN in ACTIVE packet data service state hands off from one RAN to 
   another, it results in an ANID change. An ANID change may or may not 
   result in a change in the MN point of attachment to the network 
   (i.e., PDSN). 
    
   If the ANID changes, but no change in the network attachment point, 
   a new A10 connection between the new PCF and serving PDSN is 
   established. If the ANID change results in a change in network 
   attachment point (i.e., PDSN), the new PDSN initiates a new PPP 
   connection setup with the MN, resulting in an update of the network 
   configuration information such as IP address and DNS server address 
   on the mobile node. In the case of Mobile IP, PPP resynchronization 
   is followed by Mobile IP registration to update the FA (PDSN) 
   address in the Mobile IP binding at the HA. 
    
   Hence, a PPP resynchronization from the PDSN could be viewed as a 
   link-layer event that updates network configuration information in 
   the MN and further provides an indication to the MN that Mobile IP 
   registration is required to update the binding in the HA with the 
   new FA address. 
    
   On the other hand, when a DORMANT mobile moves, the RAN is not aware 
   of the presence of the mobile in its area (as the radio link is not 
   in established state). The RAN relies on the MN to inform it of the 
   MN∆s presence. The ANID for the RAN, which is broadcast on the 
   overhead channel, is used as a link-layer hint by the MN. When a 
   dormant MN moves and the ANID changes, the MN registers with the RAN 
   to initiate a new A10 connection between the new RAN and PDSN. If 
   the ANID change also results in a change in the network attachment 
   point, not only is a new A10 connection established, but also a new

   PPP connection is established between the new PDSN and MN. The RAN 
   transitions the MN from DORMANT to ACTIVE state in order to 
   resynchronize the PPP connection. This results in an update in the 
   network layer configuration information such as IP address and DNS 
   server address in the MN. In the case of Mobile IP, PPP 
   resynchronization is followed by Mobile IP registration to update 
   the FA (PDSN) address in the Mobile IP binding at the HA. 
    
   As described above, a lower-layer hint (ANID change) allows a MN to 
   discover a potential change in the network point of attachment. From 
   IP's perspective, changes in the PPP link status provide hints about 
   the network attachment change. 
 
 
3.3. WLAN 
 
   WLANs are the wireless extension of the Local Area Networks. A WLAN 
   offers MNs short range network access at high rate. The maximum 
   coverage area of a node is usually from few meters indoors to more 
   than one hundred meter outdoor. The raw bandwidth varies between 
   1Mbps to 54Mbps depending on the norm used and the configuration of 
   the equipment. 
    
   The IEEE 802.11 series are specified by IEEE since 1997 and the 
   currently available standards are IEEE 802.11b [802.11b] and IEEE 
   802.11g [802.11g] operating in the 2.4GHz band, and IEEE 802.11a 
   [802.11a] operating in the 5GHz band. The specification defines both 
   the MAC-layer and the physical-layer (e.g., modulation techniques 
   and radio propagation). The MAC level is the same for all these  
   technologies. 
    
   Two operating modes are available in the IEEE 802.11 series. In  
   ad-hoc mode, each equipment in range may directly communicate with 
   each other, i.e. without any infrastructure or intermediate hop. In 
   the infrastructure mode, all link-layer frames are transmitted to an 
   access point (AP) which then forwards them to the final receiver. 
    
   In this section MN refers to a IEEE 802.11 station without the AP 
   functionality.

3.3.1. Network Reference Model 
 
 
   In the infrastructure mode, the network connectivity is offered to 
   MN (IEEE 802.11 station) through an AP. An AP is a bridge between 
   the wireless domain and the wired domain. The coverage area of an AP 
   defines a cell. A BSS (Basic Service Set) is composed of one AP and 
   at least one attached MN. A common IEEE 802.11 infrastructure is 
   shown in Figure 5.

   When several APs are connected together through a DS (Distribution 
   System), the set of all cells is called ESS for Extended Service 
   Set. The structure of the DS is not defined in the IEEE 802.11 
   standard and any technology can be used as DS medium. The document 
   IEEE 802.11f [IAPP] proposes the Inter-AP protocol (IAPP) to be used 
   between APs of the same ESS. Some information on attached MNs may be 
   exchanged in an ESS in order to enable context transfers and enhance 
   MN's roaming. 
    
   When a MN moves out of the coverage area of its current AP, it may 
   attach to a new AP. The new AP can be connected to the same access 
   network as well as it can be connected to a different access 
   network, this makes no difference at the link layer. However, if the 
   new AP is connected to the same subnet as the old AP, the MN can 
   continue its IP communication through the new AP without any 
   configuration change at the network-layer. But if the new AP is 
   connected to a different subnet, the MN needs to configure a new IP 
   address valid for the new subnet and use some additional mechanism

   to maintain its ongoing communication sessions, such as Mobile IP 
   [MIPv4, MIPv6]. 
    
   A MN must be associated with an AP in order to send and receive data 
   frames. At any given time, a MN can be associated with only one 
   AP on each IEEE 802.11 interface. When a MN moves between two APs, 
   it has to switch into promiscuous mode to discover and initiate a 
   connection with a new AP. A MN cannot send IP packets during the 
   establishment of a connection with an AP. 
    
   Being associated implies that the MN has established a relationship 
   with the AP. Three different steps are required for the MN to be 
   associated with an AP: first the MN evaluates the potential APs in 
   its range. In active mode, the MN scans its default channel to 
   identify the available APs (exchange of Probe Request and Probe 
   Response). If the MN does not receive any response from AP (e.g., no 
   APs are operating in this channel), the MN switches to the next 
   channel and continues the scanning. In passive mode, the MN only 
   listens to beacons sent by AP to discover the potential APs. 
    
   Once the MN discovers its target AP and its parameters, an 
   authentication phase begins (exchange of Authentication 
   Request/Response).  
    
   When a MN succeeds the authentication process, it can associate with 
   the AP (exchange of Association Request/Response). The MN sends its 
   different link-layer parameters and the AP may accept to include the 
   MN in the BSS. A MN may also issue a Re-association Request when the 
   new AP belongs to the same ESS as the old AP of the MN. The 
   Re-association message contains the MAC address of the old AP of the 
   MN, allowing the new AP to inform old AP that the MN will now be 
   associated with it. It can be noted that even if the two APs belong 
   the same ESS, they can be on different IP subnets. No assumption is 
   made on the location of APs in IEEE 802.11 series. 
 
 
3.3.2.  Link-layer Hints 
    
   The roaming of MNs between APs is managed by the link-layer protocol 
   and is known as link-layer handover. As long as the MN moves between 
   Aps in the same access network, the IP layer is not involved in the 
   movement management. However, when the MN handovers to a new AP in 
   another IP subnet, the MN needs to perform operations to maintain 
   its existing communications [MIPv4, MIPv6]. Therefore, even if a 
   link-layer handover occurs at the link layer, it doesn't necessarily 
   imply a network-layer handover. 
    
   Upon reception of the Association (or Re-association) response 
   message from the AP indicating that the association is accepted, the 
   MN is associated to the AP. It can then transmit and receive data 
   packets through this AP. This association is valid as long as the MN

   does not receive a Deauthentication message or a Deassociation 
   message from its AP, or the MN moves to a new AP. 
    
   So the reception of a (Re-)Association Response that completes a 
   successful association can be taken as a hint that the point of 
   attachment to the network of the MN may have changed. There is no 
   mechanism at the link-layer that allows the MN to know if it has 
   also changed of IP network. 
 
   When the MN receives a Deauthentication message or a Disassociation 
   message, it means that the MN is no longer authenticated or 
   associated with the AP which sends the message. So this message may 
   be a hint to indicate that IP packets can not be sent through this 
   interface until the reception of a subsequent Association Response. 
   If the MN wants to associate with the AP which sent the message, it 
   needs to re-authenticate itself. 
 
   The link identifier used by the MN is the BSSID (Basic Service Set 
   Identification). The BSSID is the MAC address of the AP and must 
   uniquely identify a BSS. However, several SSIDs can be configured on 
   a single AP, to enable different VLANs for example. So a MN can 
   switch between two SSIDs and change its network-layer configuration 
   while connected to the same AP. Therefore, in the context of DNA, 
   use of (BSSID, SSID) tuple is suggested as the link identifier. 
   BSSID and SSID information is included in Association Request and 
   Authentication Request sent by MN, and in Probe Response sent by the 
   AP.  
 
 
4.0  Abstraction 
 
   Successful usage of link-layer hints by IP depends on the 
   availability of a common framework. Abstracting useful link-layer 
   hints is essential for providing interoperability between the 
   various link-layers and IP. This document limits the scope of hints 
   to those that are relevant to network-layer configuration changes. 
 
4.1. Link Identifier 
 
   An identifier should used to address a link on the host side. Any 
   given link-layer hint should be accompanied with the associated link 
   identifier.  
    
   In GPRS networks, the relevant link-layer events provide a TI 
   (Transaction Identifier) that includes NSAPI (Network Layer Service 
   Access Point Identifier). NSAPI can be used as the link identifier 
   as it can uniquely identify the associated PDP context.   
    
   3GPP2 networks use PPP for the link-layer. Ideally a unique 
   identifier associated with the PPP instance should be the link 
   identifier. But the architecture does not provide such a handle. The 
   closest it provides is ANID (Access Network Identifier), which is 


  
Yegin et. al.             Expires April 2004                           
[Page 19]                      L2 Hints                   October 2003 
                                    
   associated with a PCF. A change in ANID (PCF) may or may not result 
   in a change in PPP link status. When ANID is used as the link 
   identifier, its change should not be interpreted as a link change 
   from IP perspective. [TBD: the loose relation between ANID and PPP 
   link is an issue.] 
 
   IEEE 802.11 networks can rely on using the (BSSID, SSID) tuple as 
   the link identifier.  
    
    
4.2. Link-up Hint 
 
   This hint is asynchronously provided to IP when a new link instance 
   is created. This hint may be generated even when the host does not 
   change its physical point-of attachment but creates a new link 
   instance with the current link-layer access device.  
    
   Network-layer may interpret this hint as a sign of possible 
   configuration change. It may react to link-up hint by reconfirming 
   its current configuration (e.g.: sending a router solicitation in 
   the case of stateless IPv6 address auto-configuration). The detailed 
   use of link-up hint for detecting network attachment is outside the 
   scope of this draft. 
    
   Creation of a new PDP context can be used to generate a link-up hint 
   in GPRS networks. Similarly, a new PPP link establishment can lead 
   to a hint in 3GPP2 networks. Note that, these are in reality more 
   than simple "hints". They usually lead to network-layer 
   configuration changes some of which take place during the link 
   establishment (e.g., IP address assignment during PPP link 
   establishment). [TBD: another term might be needed for these types] 
    
   In IEEE 802.11 networks, association and re-association events 
   indicate that a new link is brought up. 
    
    
4.3. Link-down Hint 
 
   This hint is asynchronously provided to IP when an existing link 
   instance is removed.  
    
   Network-layer may interpret this hint as a sign of possible 
   configuration change. This hint might be followed by a link-up hint 
   in the case of a handover. The detailed use of link-down hint for 
   detecting network attachment is outside the scope of this draft.  
 
   The deactivation of PDP context in GPRS networks can be used to 
   generate the link-down hint. Bringing down a PPP connection in 3GPP2 
   would have the same effect. De-authentication and disassociation 
   events in IEEE 802.11 networks can lead to a link-down hint being 
   sent to IP.

5.0  Security Considerations 
 
   The link-layer hints are advisory only. They SHOULD be used as 
   indications of possible network-layer configuration change, not an 
   absolute change. When used in this context, potential security 
   threats from their use is limited but not necessarily completely 
   eliminated. A faked link-layer hint can still be used to launch a 
   denial-of service attack on the host and the associated network. 
   Secure generation and delivery of these hints MUST be ensured. This 
   is a subject for lower-layer designs and therefore it is outside the 
   scope of this document.

Appendix A 
 
   This section describes the additional events and the associated 
   information with the GPRS networks. Unlike the PDP context changes, 
   the following events do not directly imply potential IP 
   configuration change. 
 
 
A.1. Routing Area and Cell Change 
 
   The GPRS Radio Sub-System is organized in sets of Routing Areas 
   (RAs), each set managed by a unique SGSN. The RAs are in turn 
   divided into cells.  
    
   A GPRS MT detects that it has entered a new cell by comparing the 
   cell's identity just received with the cell identity stored in the 
   MT's Mobility Management context. A cell update procedure with the 
   network then takes place between the MT and the SGSN.   
              
   If the new cell is inside a new RA, the MT detects it by 
   periodically comparing the RA identifier stored in its MM context 
   with that just received from the new cell and initiates a RA update 
   procedure with the SGSN. If the SGSN receiving the RA update request 
   realizes that the old RA is not handled by itself, then it knows 
   that an inter-SGSN RA update is required. Necessary updates are 
   performed in the GPRS Network Sub-System:   
    
   - The new SGSN starts a handover procedure whereby it requests and 
   receives the MM and PDP contexts from the old SGSN of the MT, before 
   packet tunneling can start to the GGSN. 
   - The MT location is updated in the network. 
    
                       
A.1.1. Hints

   The MT initiates the RA update procedure by sending a "Routing Area 
   Update Request" to the new SGSN. This is potentially a hint to the 
   IP layer advertising an imminent change of SGSN (GPRS Access Point).  
              
   The network confirms that it has updated the RA (SGSN) by sending a 
   "Routing Area Update Accept" to the MT. The MN can utilize this 
   message as a hint the MT's SGSN has changed following the handover 
   procedure.  
              
   The accept message comes along with an update of the MM context with 
   new information as described below:  
    
   - New P-TMSI  
   - New Cell Identity  
   - New RA Identity  
   - New ciphering algorithm, key and sequence number  
 
A.2. Sub-link-layer Hints 
 
   Some of the information, such as the signal quality (e.g., channel's 
   Bit Error Rate) and signal level, are not link-layer information but 
   rather GPRS Radio Link Control (RLC) parameters. Nonetheless, their 
   knowledge at the network-layer might be useful to assess the 
   pertinence of deciding to attach in the case where their values are 
   below the limits which are deemed necessary or required for the 
   attachment.  
              
   The RLC parameters corresponding to the two identified hints are:  
    
   - RXLEV, the received signal strength  
   - RXQUAL, the received signal quality
