Kbps = 65536 Bps, Ndata_size = 200 packets, PACKET_SIZE = 1024 bytes,
Tsend_alarm = 50 ms = 20 ticks per second.

Tnulldata_min = 2000 ms
Tnulldata_max = 16000 ms
H = Ceiling(B/R)
B = MaxChildren
M = measured RTT at the sender
A = smoothed RTT
D = smoothed mean deviation

g = 1/8, g is the gain for the RTT average.
h = 1/4, h is the gain for deviation
A = 0, current RTT estimator
D = 3 seconds

RTO = A + 4D

Z = T/b1*Ln(b2*X - 1)

N = 3, This is the expected number of NACKs, if all the Children miss
T = (0.6)*RTT*b1/Ln(N)
b1 = Ln(B) + 1
b2 = Exp(b1) -1
Thb = 1 sec.
F = 3
HopRTT = the maximum of child round trip times. HopRTT = 0 for a node
TotalRTT-down = maximum of the RTT to each child plus the TotalRTT-
TotalRTT-up = HopRTT plus parent's TotalRTT-up
