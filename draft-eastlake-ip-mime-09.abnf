version=n
         This parameter exposes the IP Version number [RFC 791] in the
         MIME Content-Type.

dilation=nnn
         Typically IP packets will be MIME labeled for transmission over
         email or other application level protocols.  Such transmission
         is generally much slower than lower level network protocols.
         While this is not usually a concern if a packet is just being
         communicated for analysis, if such transmission is used to
         establish a tunnel, the sender of a datagram may wish to advise
         the recipient of the estimated rough time dilation factor.  For
         example, if datagrams typically take around a second and
         occasionally up to ten seconds end-to-end but it is more like a
         minute and occasionally up to ten minutes if they are MIME
         encoded in email, a "dilation=60" parameter would be
         reasonable.

         Note: Although IP and TCP are defined as timing independent
         protocols, many implementations actually have timeouts built





         in.

address=xxx
         Full, if slow, IP connectivity via an application level
         protocol such as SMTP [RFC 2821, 2822] might require that
         routing, tunneling, and/or interface entries be installed at
         each end. Routing entries would be best created or updated by
         routing protocol messages and the establishment of tunnels is
         beyond the scope of this MIME type specification.  However, the
         "address=" parameter enables the sender to optionally indicate
         an IP address for return traffic to itself.  This may only be
         useful in cases where the sender knows an address that is
         available for itself in the recipient's addressing environment.
         It can be viewed as a replacement for ARP [RFC 826] on the
         possible path to the source of the APPLICATION/IP object via
         the same application level protocol.  (A receiver of an
         APPLICATION/IP object with an "address=" parameter might
         reasonably require that it be authenticated as meeting their
         policy as to from whom they would accept such information.  For
         example, they could ignore "address=" parameters unless the
         APPLICATION/IP object was wrapped in an acceptable
         MULTIPART/SIGNED [RFC 1847] authentication, although that
         implies some trust relationship between the parties.)

         Examples:

address="10.100.1.10"

address="1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:4171"
