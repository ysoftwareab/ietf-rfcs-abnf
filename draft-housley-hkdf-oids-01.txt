1.  Introduction

   The HKDF algorithm [RFC5869] is a key derivation function based on
   the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC).  This document assigns
   algorithm identifiers to the HKDF algorithm when used with three
   common one-way hash functions.  These algorithm identifiers are
   needed to make use of the HKDF in some security protocols, such as
   the The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  ASN.1

   In this specification, values are generated using ASN.1 [X.680] using
   the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and the Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER) [X.690].

2.  HKDF Algorithm Identifiers

   This section assigns algorithm identifier to HKDF [RFC5869] used with
   three common one-way hash functions that are specified in [SHS],
   SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  When any of these three object
   identifiers appears within the ASN.1 type AlgorithmIdentifier, the
   parameters component of that type SHALL be absent.

   The specification of AlgorithmIdentifier is available in [RFC5911],
   which is an evolution from the original definition in X.509
   [X.509-88].

   The assigned object identifiers are:

   id-alg-hkdf-with-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
       us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) alg(3) TBD1 }

3.  ASN.1 Module

   This section contains the ASN.1 module for the HKDF algorithm
   identifiers.  This module imports types from other ASN.1 modules that
   are defined in [RFC5912].

     { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)

4.  Security Considerations

   In spite of the simplicity of HKDF, there are many security
   considerations that have been taken into account in the design and
   analysis of this construction.  An exposition of all of these aspects
   is well beyond the scope of this document.  Please refer to [EPRINT]
   for detailed information, including rationale for the HKDF design.

5.  IANA Considerations

   One object identifier for the ASN.1 module in the Section 3 was
   assigned in the SMI Security for S/MIME Module Identifiers
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.0) [IANA-MOD] registry:

   id-mod-hkdf-oid-2019 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
      iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
      pkcs-9(9) smime(16) mod(0) TBD0 }

   Three object identifiers for the HKDF algorithm identifiers were
   assigned in the SMI Security for S/MIME Mail Security Algorithms
