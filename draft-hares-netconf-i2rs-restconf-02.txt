1.  Introduction

   This a proposal for the following two RESTCONF capabilities to
   augment RESTCONF [RFC8040] to support the first version of the I2RS
   protocol: Control plane datstore capability and ephemeral state
   capability.  The yang that supports this proposal is described in
   [I-D.hares-netmod-i2rs-yang].  This work is based on the datastore
   definitions in [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   This draft parallels a similar proposal for NETCONF [RFC6241] is
   described in [I-D.hares-netconf-i2rs-protocol].  One difference
   between the proposed capabilities for i2rs control-plane capability
   additions to NETCONF and the proposed capabilities for i2rs control-
   plane for RESTCONF is write-collection.  RESTCONF has edit-collision
   capability already which only needs a usage description.

1.1.  Background on I2RS

   The I2RS architecture [RFC7921] defines the I2RS interface "a
   programmatic interface for state transfer in and out of the Internet
   routing system".  The I2RS protocol is a protocol designed to a
   higher level protocol comprised of a set of existing protocols which
   have been extended to work together to support a new interface to the
   routing system.  The I2RS protocol is a "reuse" management protocol
   which creates new management protocols by reusing existing protocols
   and extending these protocols for new uses, and has been designed to
   be implemented in phases [RFC7921].

1.2.  Structure of draft

   The structure of this document is:

      Section 2 provides definitions and background on I2RS work.  (If
      you are familiar with the I2RS architecture and requirements, you
      can skip this section.)

      Section 3 describes the RESTCONF control plane datastore
      capability.

      Section 4 describes the RESTCONF ephemeral state capabiilty. .

2.  Definitions and Background on I2RS

   This section reviews definitions from I2RS architecture, and provides
   background on I2RS work for the reader.

2.1.  IETF Requirements language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  I2RS Definitions

   The I2RS architecture [RFC7921] defines the following terms:

   ephemeral data:   is data which does not persist across a reboot
      (software or hardware) or a power on/off condition.  Ephemeral
      data can be configured data or data recorded from operations of
      the router.  Ephemeral configuration data also has the property
      that a system cannot roll back to a previous ephemeral
      configuration state.  (See [RFC7921] for an architectural
      overview, [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state] for requirements, and
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] for discussion of how the

      ephemeral datastore as a control plane datastore interacts with
      intended datstore and dynamic configuration protocols to form the
      applied datastore".

   local configuration:   is the data on a routing system which does
      persist across a reboot (software or hardware) and a power on/off
      condition.  Local configuration has the ability to roll back to a
      pervious configuration state.  Local configuration is defined as
      the intended datastore [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] which
      is modified by dynamic configuration protocols (such as DHCP) and
      the I2RS ephemeral data store

   dynamic configuration protocols datastore  are configuration
      protocols such as DHCP that interact with the intended datastore
      (which does persist across a reboot (software or hardware) power
      on/off condition), and the I2RS ephemeral state control plane
      datastore.

   control plane protocols datastore  is a datastore which is loaded by
      control plane protocols (e.g.  I2RS protocol) rather than system
      configuration protocols.  (see
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores]).

   operator-applied policy:    is a policy that an operator sets that
      determines how the ephemeral datastore as a control plane data
      store interacts with applied datastore (as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores]).  This operator policy
      consists of policy knobs that the operator sets to determine how
      the I2RS agent control plane ephemeral state datastore will
      interact with the intended configuration datastor and the dynamic
      configuration protocol datastore.  Three policy knobs could be
      used to implement this policy:

      *  policy knob 1: I2RS Ephemeral control-plane datastore takes
         takes precedence over the intended datastore in the routing
         protocols.

      *  policy knob 2: Updated intended configuration datastore takes
         precedence over the I2RS ephemeral control-plane data store in
         the routing protocols

      *  policy knob 3: Ephemeral control plane datastore takes
         precedence over any other dynamic configuration protocols
         datastore.

2.3.  I2RS protocol requirements

   The requirements for the I2RS protocol are defined in the following
   documents:

   o  I2RS Problem Statement [RFC7920],

   o  I2RS Architecture [RFC7921],

   o  I2RS Traceability [RFC7922],

   o  Publication and Subscription [RFC7923],

   o  I2RS Ephemeral State Requrements, ,
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state]

   o  I2RS Protocol Security Requirements,
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements]

   The Interface to the routing System (I2RS) creates a new capability
   for the routing systems, and with greater capaiblities come a greater
   need for security.  The requirements for a secure environment for
   I2RS is described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-security-environment-reqs].

3.  RESTCONF control plane datastore capability

   capability-name: i2rs-control-plane

3.1.  Overview

   The i2rs-control-plane datastore capability enables the RESTCONF to
   support the following dynamic control plane datastore.

   o  API resource that is {+restconf}/datastore/<datastore-name>/data/
      and operational state specific to the control plane datastore
      ({+restconf/cp-data/opstate}).

   o  It also includes the ability to have the applied datastore and the
      opstate datatstore (per [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores]) with
      the ability to return meta-data with the following information:

      *  Entity-Tag encoding of <client-id><priority> or any portion of
         the filter.

      *  "with defaults"

      *  "with validation" - Yang specified validation (Unclear if this
         is the best way for validation.)

   Ability to provide read access for the configuration datstore

   Ability to provide read access for other dynamic datastores

3.2.  Dependencies

   This protocol strawman utilizes the following existing proposed
   features for NETCONF and RESTCONF

   o  RESTCONF [RFC8040].

   o  Module library [RFC7895],

   o  RESTCONF Patch Media Type [RFC8072],

   o  NETCONF Support for event notifications
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notifications],

   o  Publication/Subscription via Push [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push],

   o  NETCONF and HTTP Transport for Event Notivications
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif],

   o  Publication/Subscription via Push [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push],

   o  syslog yang module (both [RFC5424] and
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-syslog-model]

3.3.  New Operations

   none

3.4.  Modified Operations

   All RESTCONF methods (OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PT, PATCH, DELETE)
   need to work in the control plane datastores.  config=TRUE data, and
   where appropriate config=FALSE data.

4.  RESTCONF protocol extensions for the ephemeral datastore

   capability-name: ephemeral-state

4.1.  Overview

   This capability defines the RESTCONF protocol extensions for control
   plane protocols that support control plane data stores with ephemeral
   data.

   Ephemeral state is not unique to I2RS work.

   The ephemeral capability is the ability to support a dynamic
   datastores which are entirely ephemeral or have ephemeral state
   modules, or ephemeral statements within objects in a modules.  These
   objects can be configuration state (config=TRUE) or operational state
   (config=FALSE).

   Ephemeral state in datastores, ephemeral modules or ephemeral objects
   within a module have one key characteristics: the data does not
   persist across reboots.  The ephemeral configuration state must be
   restored by a client, and the operational state will need to be
   regenerated.

   The entire requirements for ephemeral state for the I2RS control
   plane protocol are listed in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state].
   Compared to RESTCONF functionality there are 4 groups of additional
   changes:

   Constraints  The ability to enforce the constraints for get (aka
      read) references (to/from) the {+restconf/data} datastore, and
      {+restconf/cp-data} control plane datastore.  ((see Ephemeral-REQ-
      02, Ephemeral-REQ-03, and Ephemeral-REQ-04 in
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state]).  The "validation" yang statement
      in [I-D.hares-netmod-i2rs-yang] could encode specific validation
      for the ephemeral case per datatstore or per object.  [Editor's
      note: Aid is needed to determine how validation occurs.]

   Ephemeral in Data Modules  Yang modules must identify Yang objects
      (modules, submodules or objects within yang modules which are
      ephemeral and augment other nodes) and allow an "ephemeral=TRUE"
      feature.

   Roll-back  an ephemeral node cannot roll-back to its previous value,

4.2.  Dependencies

   The ephemeral capabilities have the following dependencies:

   o  Yang modules must support the following:

      *  identifying datastores, modules, and objects as ephemeral.
         (ephemeral=True)

      *  Ability to have control plane datastores which are ephemeral.

   o  The following features must be supported by RESTCONF

      *  Module library [RFC7895],

      *  RESTCONF Protocol [RFC8040],

      *  RESTCONF Patch Media Type [RFC8072],

      *  NETCONF Support for event notifications

      *  NETCONF and HTTP Transport for Event Notivications
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif],

      *  Subsribing to Yang datastore push updates
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push],

4.3.  Capability identifier

   The ephemeral-datastore capability is identified by the following
   capability string: ephemeral (TBD URI)

4.4.  New Operations

   none

4.5.  Modification to data resources

   RESTCONF must be able to support the ephemeral data in an an control-
   plane dynamic datastore.  This is any API resource that is
   {+restconf}/datastore/<datastore-name>/data/ and operational state
   specific to the control plane datastore ({+restconf/cp-data/
   opstate}).

   RESTCONF library functions must be able to store an indication that a
   data module has ephemeral state as meta-data.

4.6.  Modification to existing operations

   RESTCONF operations of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE must be able
   to filter on meta-data with "ephemeral" flag.  (Should this be only
   read).

   The operations must support the following things about ephemeral.

   1.  The ephemeral does not persist over a reboot,

   2.  an ephemeral node cannot roll-back to its previous value,

6.  Security Considerations

   The security requirements for the I2RS protocol are covered in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].  The security
   environment the I2RS protocol is covered in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-security-environment-reqs].  Any person implementing
   or deploying the I2RS protocol should consider both security
   requirements.
