1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] is an architecture
   that provides multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without
   requiring intermediate routers to maintain multicast related per-flow
   state.  BIER can be supported in MPLS and non-MPLS networks.

   [RFC8296] specifies a common BIER header format for both MPLS and
   non-MPLS networks, though the first 20-bits of the BIER header
   (referred as BIFT-id) is a "MPLS Label" in case of MPLS networks and
   is a "domain-wide-unique-value" representing the combination of SD-
   BSL-SI in case of non-MPLS networks.
   [I-D.ietf-bier-non-mpls-bift-encoding] specifies two optional ways of
   statically assigning domain-wide-unique mapping between BIFT-id's and
   SD-BSL-SI combination.

   However, BIER architecture [RFC8279] does not require domain-wide-
   unique BIFT-id's to be used (even for non-MPLS encapsulation).  As
   discussed in [I-D.zzhang-bier-rift], the BIFT-id in case of non-MPLS

Internet-Draft    LSR Extensions for BIER over Ethernet     January 2022


   encapsulation can also just be a local 20-bit opaque value and
   signaled just like in MPLS case.  This doucment updates section
   2.2.1.1 of [RFC8296] that the BIFT-id for a SD-BSL-SI in case of non-
   MPLS encapsulation need not be unique through out the BIER domain.
   In such a case when the BIFT-id is not unique, the BIFT-id in the
   packet is expected to change as the packet travels.

   As an example, suppose a particular BIER domain contains a SD (SD 0),
   supports two BSLs (256 and 512), and contains 1024 BFRs.  A BFR that
   is provisioned for above SD, and that supports both BSLs, could
   advertise the following set of BIFT-id's:

      BIFT-id 1: corresponding to SD 0, BSL 256, SI 0.

      BIFT-id 2: corresponding to SD 0, BSL 256, SI 1.

      BIFT-id 3: corresponding to SD 0, BSL 256, SI 2.

      BIFT-id 4: corresponding to SD 0, BSL 256, SI 3.

      BIFT-id 5: corresponding to SD 0, BSL 512, SI 0.

      BIFT-id 6: corresponding to SD 0, BSL 512, SI 1.

   Notice that the example uses ranges of continuous BIFT-id's:

      BIFT-id range [1 to 4] correspond to <SD 0, BSL 256>.  The first
      BIFT-id in the range correspond to SI=0, the second correspond to
      SI=1, and so on.

      BIFT-id range [5 to 6] correspond to <SD 0, BSL 512>.  The first
      BIFT-id in the range correspond to SI=0, the second correspond to
      SI=1.

   Strictly speaking, using contiguous range is not required, but it is
   done for the purpose of simplified signaling similar to MPLS label
   blocks (notice that locally assigning BIFT-id ranges requires no
   manual processing just like in the case of MPLS label block
   allocation).

   Processing and forwarding of BIER packets requires special software
   and hardware capabilities.  The BFRs supporting a BIER encapsulation
   type MUST advertise this capability (along with the other required
   parameters specific to the encapsulation) to the other routers in
   BIER domain.  This advertisement, for example, will enable the other
   BFRs in the BIER domain in deciding, whether to include or exclude
   the advertising router from the BAR and/or IPA algorithm while
   computing the multicast path for a specific encapsulation type.

   [RFC8401], [RFC8444] and [I-D.ietf-bier-ospfv3-extensions] specifies
   the required extensions to the IS-IS [RFC1195], OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and
   OSPFv3 [RFC8362] protocols respectively for the distribution of BIER
   sub-domain information including the Sub-sub-TLV required to support
   BIER in MPLS encapsulation for MPLS networks.

   This document specifies the required extensions to the IS-IS
   [RFC1195], OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC8362] protocols for
   supporting BIER using BIER in Ethernet encapsulation with dynamically
   and locally assigned BIFT-id's.

   Support for other encapsulation types are outside the scope of this
   document.

2.  Terminology

   Some of the terminology specified in [RFC8279] is replicated here and
   extended by necessary definitions:

   BIER:  Bit Index Explicit Replication

      (The overall architecture of forwarding multicast using a Bit
      Position).

   BIER-MPLS:  BIER in MPLS encapsulation.

      (Encapsulation of BIER header inside MPLS header in MPLS
      networks).

   BIER-ETH:  BIER in Ethernet encapsulation.

      (Encapsulation of BIER header inside Ethernet header
      (EtherType=0xAB37) in non-MPLS networks).

   BFR:  Bit Forwarding Router (A router that participates in Bit Index

      Multipoint Forwarding).  A BFR is identified by a unique BFR-
      prefix in a BIER domain.

   BIFT:  Bit Index Forwarding Table used to forward the BIER packets in
      a domain.


   BAR:  BIER Algorithm.  Used to calculate underlay nexthops

      as defined by the BAR value.

   IPA:  IGP Algorithm.  May be used to modify, enhance or replace the

Internet-Draft    LSR Extensions for BIER over Ethernet     January 2022


      calculation of underlay paths as defined by the BAR value

   SD:  BIER sub-domain

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification

   A BIER sub-domain MAY support multiple BIER encapsulation types like
   BIER-MPLS, BIER-ETH.  The different encapsulation types supported by
   a BFR in a sub-domain MUST share the same BFR-id.  This would allow
   the BFR's in transit to translate the encapsulation from one type to
   the other while forwarding the packet in the BIER sub-domain.

   When a BFIR/BFR supports multiple BIER encapsulation types, when
   sending to a BIER neighbor it MUST use a type that the neighbor also
   supports.  If the neighbor also supports more than one encapsulation
   type that this BFIR/BFR supports, the type selection could be a
   matter of local policy and is outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  IS-IS BIER Ethernet Encapsulation Sub-sub TLV

   BIER Info sub-TLV defined in [RFC8401] is used to advertise the sub-
   domain id, and other associated parameters of the sub-domain like
   BFR-id, MT, BAR, IPA.

   This document introduces new sub-sub-TLV under BIER Info sub-TLV to
   advertise the ethernet encapsulation capability and other associated
   parameters of the encapsulation.

   This sub-sub-TLV carries the information for the BIER Ethernet
   encapsulation including the BitString length supported for a certain
   <MT,SD> pair.

   It is advertised within the BIER Info sub-TLV defined in [RFC8401]
   which in-turn is carried within the TLVs 235, 237 [RFC5120] or TLVs
   135 [RFC5305], or TLV 236 [RFC5308].

   This sub-sub-TLV MAY appear multiple times within a single BIER Info
   sub-TLV.  If the same BitString length is repeated in multiple BIER
   Ethernet encapsulation sub-sub-TLVs inside the same BIER Info sub-
   TLV, the BIER Info sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   Max SI:  A 1 octet field encoding the Maximum Set Identifier

    subdomain for this BitString length.  The first BIFT-id is for SI=0,
    the second BIFT-id is for SI=1, etc.  If the BIFT-id associated with
    the Maximum Set Identifier exceeds the 20-bit range, the sub-sub-TLV
    MUST be ignored.

   Local BitString Length (BS Len):  A 4 bit field encoding the
    bitstring length (as per [RFC8296]) supported for the encapsulation.

   BIFT-id:  A 20 bit field encoding the first BIFT-id of the BIFT-id
    range.
     The "BIFT-id range" is the set of 20-bit values beginning with the
    BIFT-id and ending with (BIFT-id + (Max SI)).  These BIFT-id's are
    used for BIER forwarding as described in [RFC8279] and [RFC8296].
     The size of the BIFT-id range is determined by the number of SI's
    (Section 1 of [RFC8279]) that are used in the network.  Each SI maps
    to a single BIFT-id in the BIFT-id range: the first BIFT-id is for
    SI=0, the second BIFT-id is for SI=1, etc.
     If the BIFT-id associated with the Maximum Set Identifier exceeds
    the 20-bit range, the BIER Ethernet Encapsulation Sub-sub-TLV
    containing the error MUST be ignored.
     BIFT-id ranges within all the BIER Ethernet Encapsulation sub-sub-
    TLVs advertised by the same BFR MUST NOT overlap.  If the overlap is
    detected, the advertising router MUST be treated as if it did not
    advertise any BIER Ethernet encapsulation sub-sub-TLVs.  However the
    BIFT-id ranges may overlap across different encapsulation types and
    is allowed.  As an example, the BIFT-id value in the Ethernet
    encapsulation sub-sub-TLV may overlap with the Label value in the
    Label range in BIER MPLS encapsulation sub-sub-TLV ([RFC8401] and is
    allowed.

3.2.  OSPFv2 BIER Ethernet Encapsulation Sub-TLV

   BIER Sub-TLV defined in [RFC8444] is used to advertise the sub-domain
   id, and other associated parameters of the sub-domain like BFR-id,
   MT, BAR, IPA.

   This document introduces new Sub-TLV under BIER Sub-TLV to advertise
   the ethernet encapsulation capability and other associated parameters
   of the encapsulation.

   <MT,SD> pair.

   It is advertised within the BIER Sub-TLV defined in [RFC8444] which
   in-turn is carried within the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV defined in
   [RFC7684].

   This Sub-TLV MAY appear multiple times within a single BIER Sub-TLV.
   If the same BitString length is repeated in multiple BIER Ethernet
   encapsulation Sub-TLVs inside the same BIER Sub-TLV, the BIER Sub-TLV
   MUST be ignored.

    TLVs advertised by the same BFR MUST NOT overlap.  If the overlap is
    detected, the advertising router MUST be treated as if it did not
    advertise any BIER Ethernet encapsulation sub-sub-TLVs.  However the
    BIFT-id ranges may overlap across different encapsulation types and
    is allowed.  As an example, the BIFT-id value in the Ethernet
    encapsulation sub-sub-TLV may overlap with the Label value in the
    Label range in BIER MPLS encapsulation sub-sub-TLV
    ([I-D.ietf-bier-non-mpls-bift-encoding] and is allowed.

   Local BitString Length (BS Len):  A 4 bit field encoding the
    bitstring length (as per [RFC8296]) supported for the encapsulation.

   Reserved:  SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on
    reception.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310]
   and the security concerns for IS-IS extensions for BIER are addressed
   in [RFC8401].  This document introduces new sub-sub-TLV for the
   already existing IS-IS TLVs defined for distributing the BIER sub-
   domain information in [RFC8401].  It does not introduce any new
   security risks to IS-IS.

   Security concerns and required extensions for OSPFv2 are addressed in
   [RFC2328] and [RFC7684] and the security concerns for OSPFv2
   extensions for BIER are addressed in [RFC8444].  This document
   introduces new Sub-TLV for the already existing OSPFv2 TLV defined
   for distributing the BIER sub-domain information in [RFC8444].  It
   does not introduce any new security risks to OSPFv2.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The document requests new allocations from the IANA registries as
   follows

5.1.  IS-IS sub-sub-TLVs for BIER Info sub-TLV Registry

      BIER Ethernet Encapsulation sub-sub-TLV: TBD1 (suggested value 2)

5.2.  OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV Sub-TLVs Registry

      BIER Ethernet Encapsulation Sub-TLV: TBD2 (suggested value 11)

5.3.  OSPFv3 Extended LSA Sub-TLVs Registry

      BIER Ethernet Encapsulation Sub-TLV: TBD3 (suggested value 11)
