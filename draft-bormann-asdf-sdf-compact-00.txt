 Semantic Definition Format (SDF) for Data and Interactions of Things:
                            Compact Notation
                   draft-bormann-asdf-sdf-compact-00

Abstract

   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
   in the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for
   use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization
   (OneDM) definitions.  Tools convert this format to database formats
   and other serializations as needed.

   The SDF format is mainly intended for interchange between machine
   generation and machine processing.  However, there often is a need
   for humans to look at and edit SDF models.

   Similar to the way Relax-NG as defined in ISO/IEC 19757-2 has an XML
   format and a compact format (Annex C), this specification defines a
   compact format to go along SDF's JSON format.

   The present version of this document is mostly a proof of concept,
   but was deemed useful to obtain initial feedback on the approach
   taken.

Internet-Draft              OneDM SDF compact                 March 2021


   The intention is to be able to bidirectionally translate between
   compact and JSON form, without appreciable semantic losses.  This
   will allow viewing SDF in compact form, apply edits if needed, and
   then continuing processing it in JSON form.  As a limitation of this
   approach, it will be difficult to always recreate the order of map
   entries (members of JSON objects) in the JSON form; this order is
   essentially arbitrary as maps (JSON objects) in JSON are unordered.
   (In the long run, it may be useful to define a canonical order in the
   SDF specification or here.)

   An initial prototype of a converter from compact form to JSON form
   was constructed during the ASDF/WISHI hackathon preceding IETF110.  A
   more complete, bidirectionally operating version of this tool is
   planned for release in week 12 of 2021.

2.  Overview

   The SDF compact format is a YAML file [YAML]; a good part of the work
   needed for a compact representation is already done by the increased
   user-friendliness of YAML over JSON.

   In addition, all the sections defined with "named<...>" in the CDDL
   definition of SDF have been compacted into map entries with space-
   separated keys, giving the kind first and the name next.  This saves
   the need for another level of hierarchy and reminds the reader of the
   kind of item being specified.

   The map key "description" is replaced by ":", which also is rendered
   in the most compact form possible in YAML.

   The dataqualities readable, writable, and observable, together with
   optionality, are compressed into a four-character map key: The first
   three are translated into "rwo" when set (default in SDF) and into
   "---" when not set.  The fourth character is "?" for optional and "!"
   for required.

   The value of this abbreviated key is a CDDL [RFC8610] rendition of
   the attributes defined in the jsonschema production in Appendix A of
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf].  To further reduce noise, a top-level array
   production in the CDDL can be represented as an array in the YAML
   (i.e., does not require additional quotes).

2.1.  Example Definition

   This is an SDF-compact version of a slightly modified copy of the
   sdfobject-cadence.sdf.json model found at the time of writing in
   OneDM's SDF playground.  (This example was chosen more or less
   randomly; better examples can probably be found.  The modification is
   the addition of a "unit" quality.)

     title: Cadence
     license: https://github.com/one-data-model/oneDM/blob/master/LICENSE

   object cadence:
     :: This Resource describes the cadence, which is the number of
        revolutions of crank per minute when cyclists pedal the
        pedals. The unit, which is the default unit, is rpm. The cadence
        Property is a read-only value that is provided by the
        server. When range (from "oic. r. baseresource") is omitted the
        default is 0 to +MAXFLOAT.
     property cadence:
       r-o!: integer .ge 0
       unit: 1/min
       :: This Property describes the rate at which a cyclist is pedalling/turning
          the pedals.
     property range:
       r-o?: [2*2 integer]
       :: The valid range for the Property in the Resource as an integer.
          The first value in the array is the minimum value, the second value in the
          array is the maximum value.
     property step:
       r-o?: integer
       :: Step value across the defined range when the range is an integer.  This
          is the increment for valid values across the range; so if range is 0..10
          and step is 2 then valid values are 0,2,4,6,8,10.

   The result of automatically converting this YAML file using the
   prototype "sdfc" tool back into the JSON form of SDF is given in
   Appendix A.  Except for the "unit" addition, it is semantically
   identical to the sdfobject-cadence.sdf.json.  Differences are visible
   in the order of map entries (members in JSON objects); a future
   version of the "sdfc" tool could attempt to preserve more of this
   order, even though it does not carry semantics.
