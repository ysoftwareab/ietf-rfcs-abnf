Internet Draft                  FCIP  MIB                   October 2004

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2. Overview of FCIP management model

   Note that the FCIP Entity is fully described in [FCIP] from a
   functional point of view. A collection of multiple instances of
   FCIP Entities and the corresponding FC Entities, described in
   [FCBB2], within an SNMP Context is referred to as an FCIP device
   here. This section describes FCIP from a management point of view.

   The FCIP device provides IP-based interconnection model to
   interconnect FC fabric elements. In this model, the FCIP devices
   along with the IP network on which they are running provide a new
   FCIP transport network.

   This IP-based FCIP Interconnection Model supports the following 
   topology:
   o The FCIP-based transport network is formed by interconnecting the
     FCIP-devices.
   o Each FCIP device has one or more FCIP Entities or Instances.


FCIP MIB                      Expires April 2005                [Page 3]
Internet Draft                  FCIP  MIB                   October 2004

   o Peer FCIP Entities are connected by FCIP Links, attached to
     VE_ports/B_Access.
   o Each FCIP Link Endpoint contains one or more Data Engines.
   o The FCIP device can work as a standalone box or as part 
     of a FC fabric element. 

   Each FCIP Entity managed by this MIB is referred to as a FCIP
   Instance. The MIB is broken up as follows:

2.1 FCIP Entity Instances Table
   The FCIP Entity table contains information about this entity's
   existing instances of FCIP entities.

2.2 FCIP Link Table
   The FCIP link table contains information about this FCIP device's 
   existing FCIP links.

2.3 FCIP TCP Connection Table
   The FCIP TCP Connection table contains information about existing TCP
   connections. Each FCIP link within a FCIP entity contains one or more
   TCP connections. The FCIP entity employs a Data Engine for each TCP
   connection for handling FC frame encapsulation, de-encapsulation and
   transmission of FCIP frames on the connection.

2.4 FCIP Dynamic Route Table
   The FCIP dynamic route table contains routing information that is
   dynamically discovered by this FCIP device. The FCIP device may use
   the SLPv2 protocol in conjunction with other protocols, such as FSPF,
   to dynamically discover other FCIP entities, and populate this table
   to map destination domains to FCIP Links.

2.5 FCIP Static Route Table
   The FCIP static route table contains routing information that is
   statically configured into this FCIP device by Network Admin.
   In the absence of dynamic discovery of remote FCIP entities, the
   Network Manager can configure remote domains and FCIP Entities
   that are reachable by this device into this table.

   At any point of time, both the static and dynamic routing tables can
   be active. If a DID is present in both tables, information in the
   static route table will take precedence over the entry in the dynamic
   route table for the same DID.

2.6 FCIP Discovery Domain Table

   The FCIP Discovery Domain Table maps this device's FCIP Entities into
   FCIP Discovery Domains.

Internet Draft                  FCIP  MIB                   October 2004

2.7 FCIP Link Error Table
   The FCIP Link Errors Table contains counters that indicate error
   conditions on an FCIP Link.

3. Relationship to other MIBs

   Objects accessible from other MIBs applicable to FCIP devices have
   not been included in this MIB. The following lists all applicable
   MIB modules/objects that should be present with FCIP-MGMT-MIB.

3.1 Relationship to the 'TCP' group of MIB-II

   This group is mandatory for all systems which implement TCP. Objects
   relevant to TCP must be obtained from this group.

3.2 Relationship to the 'interfaces' MIB

   The 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces.
   Each logical/virtual interface created as an FCIP Link should be
   represented as a row in the ifTable with a unique ifIndex value and a
   value of ifType 'fcipLink' (224) for each such interface.  For a
   complete list of interface types, refer to the IANA registry at
   "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mib/iana.mib/ianaiftype.mib".  These are
   the only ifIndex values of relevance to an FCIP Entity because FCIP
   runs on top of TCP/IP.  When an FCIP entity has data to transmit to
   a peer FCIP entity, it gives it to TCP, and TCP formats the data into
   segments and gives them to IP; IP puts the data into datagrams which
   it sends on whatever one or more physical interfaces IP has available.
   Therefore, only IP, not an FCIP Entity, has knowledge of the ifIndex
   values for physical interfaces.

3.3 Relationship to the Fibre Channel Management MIB

   The Fibre Channel Management MIB [FCMGMT] is assumed for FC
   functionality managed objects.

3.4 Specific Interface Group MIB Objects

The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
applying the objects defined in the Interfaces Group MIB to FCIP Links.
For those objects not listed here, refer to their generic definitions
in [RFC2863].

     Object                   Guidelines

     ifType                   'fcipLink' (224)


FCIP MIB                      Expires April 2005                [Page 5]
Internet Draft                  FCIP  MIB                   October 2004

     ifSpeed                  The ifSpeed for the physical interface(s)
                              over which the FCIP Link runs.

     ifPhysAddress            There is no physical address corresponding
                              to an FCIP Link (only WWN). Reported as 0.

     ifAdminStatus            Write access is not required, and support
                              for 'testing' is not required.

     ifOperStatus             Support for 'testing' is not required.
                              The value 'dormant' has no meaning for
                              FCIP Links.

     ifInOctets               The number of octets of FCIP information
     ifHCInOctets             contained in received frames in TCP
                              streams, starting with FCIP header.

     ifInUcastPkts            The number of FCIP frames received
     ifHCInUcastPkts          on this FCIP Link.

     ifOutOctets              The number of octets of FCIP information
     ifHCOutOctets            contained in transmitted frames in TCP
                              streams, starting with FCIP header.

     ifOutUcastPkts           The number of FCIP frames transmitted
     ifHCOutUcastPkts         on this FCIP Link.

     ifInMulticastPkts        These counters are not incremented.
     ifInBroadcastPkts
     ifOutMulticastPkts
     ifOutBroadcastPkts
     ifHCInMulticastPkts
     ifHCInBroadcastPkts
     ifHCOutMulticastPkts
     ifHCOutBroadcastPkts

     ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default is 'disabled'.

     ifPromiscuousMode        This will be 'false'

     ifConnectorPresent       This will be 'false'.

4. Changes from draft-ietf-ips-fcip-mib-05.txt

   o  Added ASCII picture depicting FCIP Device/Entity/Link.

   o  Added 'fcipLink' value and IANA URL for ifType MIB.

6. Security considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. In particular, write access to
   fcipDiscoveryDomainName and fcipEntityAddress can cause a loss of
   reachability to portions of the SAN.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that contain what
   could be considered as sensitive information.  In particular, the
   objects which provide information on identification and network
   topology:

   fcipDeviceWWN
   fcipEntityName
   fcipEntityAddress
   fcipLinkLocalFcipEntityAddress
   fcipLinkRemFcipEntityWWN
   fcipLinkRemFcipEntityAddress
   fcipDynamicRouteTable
   fcipStaticRouteTable
   fcipDiscoveryDomainTable

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
