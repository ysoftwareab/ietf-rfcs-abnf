Internet-Draft  Language tags for North Frisian dialects  September 2010


1.  Introduction

   North Frisian is a language spoken primarily by the North Frisians,
   an autochthonic minority in the north-west of Germany in the district
   of Nordfriesland, with approximately 10,000 speakers.  The language
   is typically divided into two groups of dialects, the mainland
   dialects, also spoken on some of the Halligen, and the insular
   dialects, spoken on some of the islands in the northern part of the
   German Bight.  The two groups are further divided in ten main
   dialects.

   This document proposes twelve language variant subtags to identify
   them for use with the ISO 639-2 three-letter code "frr" that
   identifies them all as a group, as per [BCP0047].  Twelve instead of
   ten because one of the main dialects, Fering-Oeoemrang, consists of
   two closely related dialects, Fering and Oeoemrang, and having to
   identify Oeoemrang with "fering", which would be the obvious choice
   for the combined dialect due to length and character restrictions for
   subtags, would be unintuitive.

   Further, the Mooring dialect is considered part of the Boekingharder
   dialect which is one of the ten main dialects; Mooring however is one
   of the dominant dialects and sometimes proposed as the standard
   variant of the language, identifying it with the truncated and
   transliterated subtag "boeking" would be similarily unintuitive.

   Note: Throughout this document, latin characters with a diaeresis
   have been transliterated by the typical german convention to replace
   them by the latin character followed by the letter "e", so o-umlaut
   becomes "oe".

2.  Dialects and variant subtags

2.1.  Soel'ring

   Soel'ring is the dialect associated with the island Sylt on the
   german north sea coast.  Syltring is an alternative name for the
   dialect that is becoming obsolete.  It has been chosen as subtag as
   the proper name contains characters that are not allowed in subtags
   and "syltring" is more commonly used than the transliteration
   "soelring".

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      syltring
     Description: The Soel'ring dialect of North Frisian

2.2.  Fering

   Fering is the dialect associated with the island Foehr on the german
   north sea coast.  It belongs to the group of insular dialects and
   together with Oeoemrang (the dialect of the neighbouring island
   Amrum) it is considered one of the ten main dialects.  The subtag
   "fering" has been chosen as it is identical to the proper name of the
   dialect.

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      fering
     Description: The Fering dialect of North Frisian

2.3.  Oeoemrang

   Oeoemrang is the dialect associated with the island Amrum on the
   german north sea coast.  Together with Fering it is considered one of
   the ten main dialects and belongs to the insular group of dialects.
   "Amring" is an alternate name for the dialect that is becoming
   obsolete; it has been chosen as subtag as the proper name contains
   characters not permitted in subtags, the transliteration is too long,
   and "Amrumer" would make the naming inconsistent with the closely
   related Fering dialect.

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      amring
     Description: The Oeoemrang dialect of North Frisian

2.4.  Halunder

   Halunder is the insular dialect of the North Frisian language
   associated with the island Heligoland in the German Bight.  The
   subtag "halunder" has been chosen to identify it as it matches the
   proper name.

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      halunder
     Description: The Halunder dialect of North Frisian

2.5.  Hallig Frisian

   Hallig Frisian is the dialect associated with the Halligen, a number
   of islands in the Wadden Sea on the german north sea coast.  Even
   though the Halligen are islands, it is considered a mainland dialect.
   The subtag "hallig" has been chosen as frisian "Halifreesk" and

   standard german "Halligfriesisch" are too long and plain "freesk" is
   ambiguous.

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      hallig
     Description: The Hallig Frisian dialect of North Frisian

2.6.  Wiedingharder

   Wiedingharder is the mainland dialect associated with the former
   administrative division Wiedingharde in the north of Nordfriesland.
   All subtags for dialects typically identified by through their
   associated Harde are formed by taking the standard german name,
   possibly truncated to meet length restrictions, and omitting the
   "harder".  The names rendered in the dialect cannot be used as they
   are either ambiguous or contain characters not allowed in subtags.

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      wieding
     Description: The Wiedinharder dialect of North Frisian

2.7.  Boekingharder

   Boekingharder is the mainland dialect associated with the former
   administrative division Boekingharde south of the Wiedingharde.

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      boeking
     Description: The Boekingharder dialect of North Frisian

2.8.  Mooring

   Mooring is the mainland dialect associated with the Risummoor, a mire
   in the east of the Boekingharde.  It is usually considered part of
   the Boekingharder dialect and further divided into the Westermooring
   and the Ostermooring.  Alongside Fering, "Frasch" (Mooring) is
   considered one of the most important dialects, and it is common to
   refer to the Boekingarder dialect as Mooring.  The subtag name is the
   proper name of the dialect.

     Type:        variant
     Prefix:      frr
     Subtag:      mooring
     Description: The Mooring dialect of North Frisian
