                       draft-venaas-bier-mtud-01

Abstract

   This document defines an IGP based mechanism for discovering the MTU
   of a BIER sub-domain.  This document defines extensions to OSPF and
   IS-IS, but other protocols could potentially be extended.  MTU
   discovery is usually done for a given path, while this document
   defines it for a sub-domain.  This allows the computed MTU to be
   independent of the set of receivers.  Also, the MTU is independent of
   rerouting events within the sub-domain.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an IGP based mechanism for discovering the MTU
   of a BIER sub-domain.  The discovered MTU indicates the largest
   possible BIER payload, such as an IP packet, that can be sent across
   any link in a BIER sub-domain.  This is different from
   [I-D.ietf-bier-path-mtu-discovery] which performs Path MTU Discovery
   (PMTUD) for a set of receivers.  PMTUD is based on probing, and when
   there are routing changes, e.g., a link going down, the actual MTU
   for a path may become less than was previously discovered, and there
   will be some delay until the next probe is performed.  Also, the set
   of receivers for a flow may change at any time, which may cause the
   MTU to change.  This document instead discovers a BIER sub-domain
   MTU, which is independent of paths and receivers within the sub-
   domain.

   Discovering the sub-domain MTU is much simpler than discovering the
   multicast path MTU, and is more robust with regards to path changes
   as discussed above.  However, the sub-domain MTU may be a lot smaller
   than the path MTU would have been for a given flow.  The discovery
   mechanisms may be combined, allowing the discovery of the path MTU
   for certain flows as needed.

   capitals, as shown here.

3.  MTU discovery procedure

   An interface on a router is said to be a BIER interface if the router
   has a BIER neighbor on the interface.  That is, there is a directly
   connected router on that interface that is announcing a BIER prefix.
   Further, the BIER interface is said to belong to a given sub-domain
   if the router itself announces a prefix tagged with the sub-domain,
   and there is BIER neighbor on the interface also announcing a prefix
   tagged with the sub-domain.

   The BIER MTU of an interface is the largest BIER encapsulated payload
   that can be sent out of the interface.  Further, the local sub-domain
   MTU of a router is the minimum of all the BIER MTUs of the BIER
   interfaces in the sub-domain.  Note that the local sub-domain MTU of
   a router is only defined if it has at least one BIER interface in the
   sub-domain.

   A BIER router announces a BIER prefix in either IS-IS or OSPF as
   specified in [RFC8401] and [I-D.ietf-bier-ospf-bier-extensions].
   They both define a BIER Sub-TLV to be included with the prefix.
   There is one BIER Sub-TLV included for each sub-domain.  This
   document defines how a router includes its local sub-domain MTU in
   each of the BIER Sub-TLVs it advertizes.

   A router can discover the MTU of a BIER sub-domain by identifying all
   the prefixes that have a BIER Sub-TLV for the sub-domain.  It then
   computes the minimum of the advertised MTU values for that sub-
   domain.  This includes its own local sub-domain MTU.  This allows all
   the routers in the sub-domain to discover the same sub-domain wide
   MTU.

   Note that a router should announce a new local MTU for a sub-domain
   immediately if the value becomes smaller than what it currently
   announces.  This would happen if the MTU of an interface is
   configured to a smaller value, or the first BIER neighbor for a sub-
   domain is detected on an interface, and the MTU of the interface is
   less than all the other local BIER interfaces in the sub-domain.
   However, if BIER neighbors go away, or if an interface goes down, so
   that the local MTU becomes larger, a router SHOULD NOT immediately
   announce the larger value.  A router MAY after some delay announce
   the new larger MTU.  The intention is that dynamic events such as a
   quick link flap should not cause the announced MTU to be increased.

4.  IS-IS BIER Sub-Domain MTU Sub-sub-TLV

   A router uses the BIER Sub-Domain MTU Sub-sub-TLV to announce the
   minimum BIER MTU of all its BIER enabled interfaces in a sub-domain.
   The BIER Sub-Domain MTU is the largest BIER encapsulated payload that
   can be sent out of the interfaces in a sub-domain.  The Sub-sub-TLV
   MUST be ignored if it is included multiple times.

5.  OSPF BIER Sub-Domain MTU Sub-TLV

   A router uses the BIER Sub-Domain MTU Sub-TLV to announce the minimum
   BIER MTU of all its BIER enabled interfaces in a sub-domain.  The
   BIER Sub-Domain MTU is the largest BIER encapsulated payload that can
   be sent out of the interfaces in a sub-domain.  The Sub-TLV MUST be
   ignored if it is included multiple times.

6.  IANA considerations

   An allocation from the "sub-sub-TLVs for BIER Info sub-TLV" registry
   as defined in [RFC8401] is requested for the IS-IS BIER Sub-Domain
   MTU Sub-sub-TLV.  Please replace the string TBD in this document with
   the appropriate value.

   An allocation from the "OSPF Extended Prefix sub-TLV" registry as
   defined in [RFC7684] is requested for the OSPF BIER Sub-Domain MTU
   Sub-TLV.  Please replace the string TBD2 in this document with the
   appropriate value.
