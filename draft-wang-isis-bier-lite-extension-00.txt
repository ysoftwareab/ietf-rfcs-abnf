Abstract

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is
   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any
   multicast related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any
   explicit tree-building protocol for its operation.  Currently, the
   data plane of BIER is apt to use BIER-MPLS encapsulation to transmit
   multicast traffic.  However, this document tries to propose a
   solution named BIER-Lite about how to extend IS-IS protocol to
   support BIER forwarding in non-MPLS underlay network instead of MPLS
   underlay network.

Internet-Draft        IS-IS Extension for BIER-Lite         October 2015


1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is
   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any
   multicast related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any
   explicit tree-building protocol for its operation.  A multicast data
   packet enters a BIER domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router"
   (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain at one or more "Bit-Forwarding
   Egress Routers" (BFERs).  The BFIR router adds a BIER header to the
   packet.  The BIER header contains a bit-string in which each bit
   represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet to.  The set of
   BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be forwarded is
   expressed by setting the bits that correspond to those routers in the
   BIER header.

   Currently, the data plane of BIER is defined in BIER-MPLS
   encapsulation [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] to transmit
   multicast traffic in MPLS encapsulation.  Admittedly, BIER-MPLS
   introduces the advantages of MPLS forwarding.  However, this requires
   the underlay network is an MPLS network, and along the path, there
   need label switching and label lookup.  Additionally, every BFR
   requires per-label forwarding table to assist BIER forwarding.
   What!_s more, prior of that, IGP protocol or BGP protocol requires a
   precise mechanism to generate these label information, after that, to
   advertise these label information to form the per-label forwarding
   table between the label and the bit index forwarding table(BIFT).
   Sometimes, how to categorize this label information in differentiated
   MPLS Encapsulation sub-sub-TLV is a difficult decision.  And some
   other times, after the label information advertisement, there may be
   some redundant label information as well as some redundant label
   forwarding table because each BFR advertises continuous labels for
   different Set Identifiers for each combination of Sub-domain and
   BitStringLength which may be redundant because traffic to some BFERs
   may not transit this advertising node, especially when these BFERs
   belonging to the same Set Identifier reside together geographically.

   In fact, some multicast scenario may be not in MPLS network, or may
   be in a relatively simple network.  In other words, if BIER
   forwarding uses IP forwarding instead of MPLS forwarding in these
   kind of networks, it would be much easier to deploy BIER in current
   deployment.  Of course, if the BIER forwarding is compatible with
   BIER-MPLS encapsulation forwarding, that would be much more
   significant.

   The following section tries to propose how to extend IS-IS protocol
   to support BIER forwarding in non-MPLS underlay network instead of
   MPLS underlay network.

3.  BIER-Lite Sub-TLV in IS-IS extension

   Given that the BIER-Lite-specific information that a BFR needs to
   advertise to other BFRs are associated with the BFR-Prefix and Multi-
   Topology information, the TLVs 135,236[RFC5305][RFC5308] and TLVs
   235,237 [RFC5120]are used to carry and flood BIER-Lite-specific
   information.

   Here, in order to implement the BIER forwarding in non-MPLS network
   and simplify the BIER forwarding mentioned in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] , a new BIER-Lite sub-TLV of the
   Extended Reachability TLVs is defined to advertise BIER-Lite-specific
   information, which is illustrated as follow in Figure 1.

     Length: 6 octet.

     M: indicating whether is compatible with BIER MPLS Encapsulation
   sub-sub-TLV.  When M is set to 1, it means if there has BIER MPLS
   Encapsulation sub-sub-TLV, validating and using the BSL information
   and label information in BIER MPLS Encapsulation sub-sub-TLV.  When M
   is set to 0, it means validating and using the BSL information in the
   BSL Identifier even if there has BIER MPLS Encapsulation sub-sub-TLV
   and ignoring all the information in BIER MPLS Encapsulation sub-sub-
   TLV.

     BSL Identifier: indicating the BSL the sending BFR supporting.

     Sub-domain-ID: unique value identifying the BIER sub-domain within

   the BIER domain, as described in section 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

     BFR-id: a 2 octet field encoding the BFR-id, as documented in
   section 2 [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].  If the BFR-id is zero, it
   means, the advertising router is not advertising any BFR-id.

   The sending BFR may support one or several BSLs, as following:

   00000001: represents BSL 64 bits;

   00000010: represents BSL 128 bits;

   00000100: represents BSL 256 bits;

   00001000: represents BSL 512 bits;

   00010000: represents BSL 1024 bits;

   00100000: represents BSL 2048 bits;

   01000000: represents BSL 4096 bits;

   Each bit represents one BSL.  When there are two or more bits set,
   that means the sending BFR supports more than one BSL.  For example,
   if the BSL Identifier is 00010101, it means the sending BFR supports
   1024 bits, 256 bits and 64 bits.

   Each BFR sub-domain MUST be associated with a single IS-IS topology.

   On the other hand, the BIER-Lite sub-TLV, which encapsulates the BSL
   information together with the BIER Info sub-TLV, may be a
   complementation and an extension of BIER Info sub-TLV defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-isis-extensions].  Additionally, adding an M
   identifier in the BIER Info sub-TLV to be compatible with BIER MPLS
   encapsulation sub-sub-TLV defined in [I-D.ietf-bier-isis-extensions].
   So, BIER-Lite sub-TLV can also multiplex and extend BIER Info sub-TLV
   defined in [I-D.ietf-bier-isis-extensions] instead of defining a new
   TLV.

4.  Flooding of BIER-Lite Information

   Flooding of the IS-IS Extended Reachablity TLVs that is used for
   advertising BIER-Lite sub-TLV should be infrequently.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document can request a new allocation from IS-IS Extended
   Reachablity sub-TLV registry for BIER-Lite sub-TLV.  Or it can
   multiplex and extend M information and BSL Identifier information to
   BIER Info sub-TLV defined in [I-D.ietf-bier-isis-extensions].
