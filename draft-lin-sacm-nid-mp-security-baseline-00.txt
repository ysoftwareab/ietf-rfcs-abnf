1.  Introduction

   Securing network infrastructure devices is a challenging and critical
   task for organizations and operators to preserve the confidentiality,
   integrity and availability of network and network traffic
   information.  The development and deployment of the security baseline
   for network infrastructure is needed to provide a solid foundation
   for the overall network security.

   To address threats and attacks to network infrastructure devices,
   different security functions are implemented in application layer,
   network layer and infrastructure layer.  Network layer of network
   infrastructure devices is typically categorized into three planes of
   operation, management plane, control plane and data plane.  All the
   planes should be protected and monitored to provide secure network.

   This document focuses on security baseline for network infrastructure
   device management plane.  Management plane provides configuration and
   monitoring services of network infrastructure devices.  It provides a
   platform for all the system management traffic.  Unauthorized access,
   using insecure access channels, implementing insecure cryptographic

   algorithms are common security issues that break management plane
   security.  To enhance security, secure configuration should be
   implemented to ensure proper configuration and control of network
   infrastructure devices.  A number of security best practices have
   been proposed, such as disabling unused services and ports,
   discarding insecure access channels, enforce strong user
   authentication and authorization, etc.  In this document, we propose
   the most important and universal points of management plane security
   baseline to provide a minimum set.  Thus, future extensibility can be
   achieved.

   YANG subscribed notifications via SACM Statements
   [I-D.ietf-birkholz-sacm-yang-content] defines a method of
   constructing the YANG data model scheme for the security posture
   assessment of the network infrastructure device by brokering of YANG
   push telemetry via SACM statements.  In this document, we follow the
   same way to define the YANG output for network infrastructure device
   security posture based on the SACM Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-information-model].

   Besides management plane security baseline, the security baselines
   for control plane, data plane, application layer and infrastructure
   layer of network infrastructure devices are described in [I-D.ietf-
   dong-sacm-nid-cp-security-baseline], [I-D.ietf-xia-sacm-nid-dp-
   security-baseline], [I-D.ietf-xia-sacm-nid-app-infr-layers-security-
   baseline], respectively.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms defined in YANG - A Data Modeling
   Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6020] .

4.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a "list" and "leaf-
      list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

5.  Data Model Structure

   To provide security in management plane of network infrastructure
   devices, strict access control, secure access channel, implementing
   secure protocol and cryptographic algorithms, logging system
   operations and secure file management are needed.

   The following parts describe several key points of management plane
   security baseline, such as how to prevent unauthenticated access and
   SNMP attacks, how to authenticate and authorize user, and how to
   safely manage device information and files.  Both security
   configuration and runtime state of security controls are included in
   the following YANG tree diagrams.

5.1.  User Interface Security

   User interfaces of network infrastructure devices provide venues for
   user login and configuration operations.  Typically, there are two
   ways to log in the device, one way is connecting the device directly
   by console port, another is connecting to the device remotely.  Thus,
   network infrastructure devices support console user interface and
   virtual type terminal user interface.  The security configuration of
   user interface includes user authentication and authorization.  User
   authentication configuration is to determine which kind of
   authentication method should be used, such as password only for
   console login, aaa for remote user login.  User authorization
   configuration is to determine the user with which level of privilege
   can successfully log into the device.  For virtual type terminal user
   interface, other security controls can be enforced, such as blocking
   ip addresses after failing authentication, clearing authentication
   request that has been pending for a certain time when the amount of
   authentication requests reaches the limit.

5.2.  Remote Login Security

   There are many access channels such as tlenet, ssh to log in the
   device through remote connection.  For different ways of connection,
   one common thing is that security configuration need to be enforced.
   The access requirements of services must be met preferentially based
   on service requirement analysis.  When an access requirement has
   multiple access channels, the insecure access channels must be
   discarded and the secure channels must be selected.  For example, it
   is strongly recommended that SSH channel should be used instead of
   Telnet for remote login, SFTP should be used instead of FTP for file
   transfer.  If insecure access channels have to be used, several
   security configuration can be enforced to provide basic security
   control.

   Access control is an important part in remote login security,
   different access channels can define different access control
   policies according to service requirements.  Access Control List
   (ACL) is usually used as a basic element for the forwarding behaviour
   configuration of network infrastructure devices.  In this document,
   access control list is also used to enforce security policies on
   network infrastructure devices.  Network Access Control List (ACL)
   YANG Data Model [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model] describes the "ietf-
   access-control-list" module to generally define the commonly used ACL
   components.  The "ietf-remote-login-security" module defined in this
   section, imports the "ietf-access-control-list" module.  The derived
   type "acl-type" is used.

5.3.  snmp management security

   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network management
   standard for monitoring managed network devices.  Three SNMP versions
   are available: SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3.RFC7407 [RFC7407] (A YANG
   Data Model for SNMP Configuration) has defined community-based
   security model for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, view-based access control
   model and user-based security model for SNMPv3.  The following module
   "ietf-snmp-management-security" reuses the security control related
   submodules defined in RFC7407 for SNMP security configuration.

5.4.  AAA

   For user management, AAA provides three types of security services,
   authentication, authorization and accounting.  In AAA user
   management, RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) or
   TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System) can be used
   for remote authentication and authorization of users.  Besides, local
   authentication can also be used.

5.5.  Log Security

   Logs record information such as user operations on devices and device
   running status.  Stored as log files on devices, logs help network
   administrators monitor the running status of routers and diagnose
   network faults.  The log records can be outputted to console, or
   stored locally, or outputted to remote Syslog server.  The following
   defined "ietf-log-security" module reuses the security related
   submodules of A YANG Data Model for Syslog Configuration
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-syslog-model], and adds security configurations to
   provide confidentiality and integrity for locally stored log files.

5.6.  File Security

   Patches, packages, configuration files are critical system files for
   network infrastructure devices.  To provide security, only users
   under certain security levels are allowed to access these files, but
   cannot delete or modify them.  For configuration files, only users
   with certain configuration rights can modify them.
