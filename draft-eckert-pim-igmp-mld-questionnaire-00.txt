1.  Introduction

   Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) [RFC3376] and
   Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6 [RFC3810] are
   currently Proposed Standards.  Given the fact that multiple
   independent implementations of these protocols exist and they have
   been successfully and widely used operationally, the PIM WG is keen
   to progress these protocols to Internet Standards.  In order to
   facilitate this effort, it is critical to establish if there are
   features specified in [RFC3376] and [RFC3810] that have not been
   widely used and also to determine any interoperability issues that
   have arisen from using the protocols.

Internet-Draft         IGMP and MLD Questionnaire             March 2019


   Following approach taken for PIM-SM, documented in [RFC7063], the PIM
   WG has decided that conducting a comprehensive survey on
   implementations and deployment of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 will provide
   valuable information to facilitate their progression to Internet
   Standard.

   This document describes the procedures proposed for conducting the
   survey and introduces the proposed questions.

2.  Procedures Followed

2.1.  Methodology

   The PIM WG Chairs will officially kick off the survey and distribute
   the questionnaire and pertinent information through appropriate
   forums, aiming to ensure the questionnaire reaches as wide an
   audience as possible.

2.2.  Intended Recipients of Questionnaire

   1.  Network operators

   2.  Router vendors

   3.  Switch vendors

   4.  Host implementors

2.3.  Processing of Responses

   Responses received will remain confidential.  Only the aggregated
   results will be published and so it will be impossible to identify
   the contributions by individual operators, vendors or implementors.
   Furthermore, an option to submit the completed questionnaire
   anonymously will be available.

3.  Questionnaire

3.1.  Questionnaire for Vendors or Host Implementors

   Name:

   Affiliation/Organization:

3.1.1.  Implementation Status

   Which of the following have you implemented?  And for how long has it
   been implemented?

   1.  IGMPv1 [RFC1112] implemented?: Y/N, since:

   2.  IGMPv2 [RFC2236] implemented?: Y/N, since:

   3.  IGMPv3 [RFC3376] implemented?: Y/N, since:

   4.  Lightweight IGMPv3 [RFC5790] Implemented: Y/N, since:

   5.  MLDv1 [RFC2710] implemented?: Y/N, since:

   6.  MLDv2 [RFC3810] implemented?: Y/N, since:

   7.  Lightweight MLDv2 [RFC5790] implemented?: Y/N, since:

3.1.2.  Implementation Specifics

   1.  Which IGMPv3 features have you implemented?

   2.  Which MLDv2 features have you implemented?

   3.  Have you carried out IGMPv3 or MLDv2 interoperability tests with
       other implementations?  (What issues arose during these tests?)
       (How could the standards have help minimize these issues?)

3.1.3.  Implementation Perspectives

   1.  What feature(s) has been deliberately omitted from IGMPv3 or
       MLDv2 implementations? (because you think it is sub-optimal or
       potentially has significant disadvantages/issues?) (because of
       insufficient demand/use cases?)

   2.  Which ambiguities or inconsistencies in RFC 3376 or RFC 3810 made
       the implementation challenging?

   3.  What suggestions would you make to the PIM WG as it seeks to
       update these documents?

       list in use?)

   2.  Which MLDv2 features are in use?  (Is Exclude mode with source
       list in use?)

   3.  Does your network rely on the fallback mechanism between
       different IGMP versions?  (Between which IGMP versions?)  (What
       is your experience with this fallback mechanism?)

   4.  Are you using equipment with different (multi-vendor)
       implementations for your deployment?  (Have you encountered any
       inter-operability or backward-compatibility issues amongst
       differing implementations?)  (What are your concerns about these
       issues?)
