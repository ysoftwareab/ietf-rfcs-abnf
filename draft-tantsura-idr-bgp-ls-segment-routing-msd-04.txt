  Signaling Maximum SID Depth using Border Gateway Protocol Link-State
            draft-tantsura-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-msd-04

Abstract

   This document proposes a way to signal Maximum SID Depth (MSD)
   supported by a node at node and/or link granularity by a BGP-LS
   speaker.  In a Segment Routing (SR) enabled network a centralized
   controller that programs SR tunnels needs to know the MSD supported
   by the head-end at node and/or link granularity to push the SID stack
   of an appropriate depth.  MSD is relevant to the head-end of a SR
   tunnel or Binding-SID anchor node where Binding-SID expansions might
   result in creation of a new SID stack.

1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing tunnels are computed by a centralized
   controller, it is critical that the controller learns the MSD
   "Maximum SID Depth" of the node or link SR tunnel exits over, so the
   SID stack depth of a path computed doesn't exceed the number of SIDs
   the node is capable of imposing.  This document describes how to use
   BGP-LS to signal the MSD of a node or link to a centralized
   controller.

   PCEP SR extensions draft [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] signals MSD
   in SR PCE Capability TLV and METRIC Object.  However, if PCEP is not
   supported/configured on the head-end of a SR tunnel or a Binding-SID
   anchor node and controller does not participate in IGP routing, it
   has no way to learn the MSD of nodes and links which has been
   configured.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology and
   associated attributes and capabilities of the nodes in that topology
   to a centralized controller.

   MSD of sub-type 1, called Base MSD as defined in Section 3 is used to
   signal the number of SID's a node is capable of imposing, to be used

   by a path computation element/controller.  In case, there are
   additional labels (e.g. service) that are to be pushed to the stack -
   this would be signaled with an another MSD type (TBD), MSD SHOULD be
   adjusted to reflect that.  In the future, new MSD types could be
   defined to signal additional capabilities: entropy labels, labels
   that can be pushed thru recirculation, or another dataplane e.g IPv6.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

2.  Problem Statement

   In existing technology only PCEP has extension to signal the MSD (SR
   PCE Capability TLV/ METRIC Object as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing],If PCEP is not supported by the node
   (head-end of the SR tunnel) controller has no way to learn the MSD of
   the node/link configured.  OSPF and IS-IS extensions are defined in:

3.  MSD supported by a node

   Node MSD is encoded in a new Node Attribute TLV, as defined in
   [RFC7752]

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Sub-Type and Value ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...

                      Figure 1: Node attribute format

   Type : A 2-octet field specifiying code-point of the new TLV type.
   Code-point: 1050 (Suggested value - to be assigned by IANA) from BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs registry

   Length: A 2-octet field that indicates the length of the value
   portion

   Sub-Type and value fields are as defined in corresponding OSPF
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-msd] and IS-IS
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-msd] extensions.

4.  MSD supported on a link

   Link MSD is encoded in a New Link Attribute TLV, as defined in
   [RFC7752]

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Sub-Type and Value ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...

                      Figure 2: Link attribute format

   Type : A 2-octet field specifiying code-point of the new TLV type.
   Code-point: 1110 (Suggested value - to be assigned by IANA) from BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs registry

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign 2 new code-points from the BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs registry as specified in sections 3 and 4.
