Internet Draft              BGP-MIB v2              July 13, 2001



1.  Abstract


   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
   based internets.  In particular, this MIB defines objects that
   facilitate the management of the Border Gateway Protocol Version 
   4 (BGP4).

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  



2. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Border Gateway Protocol Version 4.

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:


    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].


    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
        events for the purpose of management. The first
        version of this Structure of Management Information
        (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
        1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
        RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].


    o   Message protocols for transferring management
        information. The first version of the SNMP message
        protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC
        1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].


    o   Protocol operations for accessing management
        information. The first set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

Internet Draft              BGP-MIB v2              July 13, 2001
    
	o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
        2573 [14] and the view-based access control mechanism
        described in RFC 2575 [15].


   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [18].


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the SMI.


3. Objectives

   This MIB Module is meant to broadly update and replace a prior MIB 
   Module defined in RFC 1657 [12].  Additionally, there is another 
   effort underway to address very specific limited objectives in
   updating points in the RFC 1657 object definition and managed object     
   attributes [13].  The MIB Module described herein is intended 
   to fully serve the functions and scope of RFC 1657 and these RFC 1657 
   updates.

   Additionally, however, there are a number of ways in which the BGP
   Protocol has been enhanced through its ability for added capabilities,
   where those capabilities have not been able to have any management
   capabilities present in RFC 1657-compliant MIB module agents, since the
   capabilities themselves postdated the adoption of RFC 1657.  For
   several significant capabilities of BGP Communities [17], Autonomous 
   System Confederation [16] , BGP Multiprotocol Extensions [18], and 
   Route Reflection [19], the MIB Module defines herein objects to manage 
   those extended capabilities and their operation.

   One of these extensions in particular (the multiprotocol extensions) 
   requires a thorough redefinition of MIB objects from the RFC 1657 
   state, so as to allow transport-independent address exposure consistent
   with the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and Subsequent Address Family 
   Identifier (SAFI) mechanisms of that extension.
  
   Moreover, the requirement for the incremental update of support for 
   capabilities such as these begs the issue of placing modular 
   extensibility for protocol extensions within the framework of the MIB
   itself.  Going forward, it would be very desirable to have attributes
   of the MIB structure, and administrative procedures, to allow the 
   incremental update of the MIB scope to cover any such new protocol 
   extensions, without requiring a reissue of the entire MIB.  In this 
   sense, we seek to structure the MIB much like the underlying BGP4 
   itself, allowing capability-by-capability update.

   Finally, the definition and adoption of Version 3 of the SNMP has 
   occurred since the adoption of the RFC 1657 MIB.  As a result, the
   ability to deploy secure configuration of managed elements via SNMP 
   in a standardized way has become a reality for managed networks.  In 
   this MIB definition effort, we seek to expose a more thorough 
   capacity for configuration of BGP4 and its capabilities than was

   present in RFC 1657 or than was common practice at the time of its
   adoption.

4. MIB Organization

   The MIB is broken down into several top level sections.  This 
   sectionalization is important to create an organization for 
   extensibility:

   * The bgpBaseScalars section (and corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER) 
     is used to delineate objects used for basic management and 
	 monitoring of the protocol implementation.   These are core 
	 parameters for the local configuration.

   * The bgpPeerData section is per-peer object definitions. The
     predominant table in that section (bgpPeerTable) describes the
     session, negotiation state, and authentication state on a 
     per peer basis.  A second table (bgpPrefixCountersTable) exposes 
	 information about individual route prefixes received 
     over each peer session.

  * bgpCapabilitiesData has objects and tables to describe  BGP 
    capabilities locally supported, and those reported and negotiated
	over each peer session.

  * bgpPathAttributesData contains objects describing destination
    networks and paths to those networks, independent of the peer
    from which the information on each network was received.

   Each section is further given an OBJECT IDENTIFIER allowing a section
   of containment for the per-capability extensions of the scope of the
   section.  

4.1  Preliminary State of Work

   The MIB herein is the first, very rough, step in the refinement of
   the managed object definition this effort seeks to define.  It is being
   offered to the community at this moment to get a read as to the 
   general directions and ideas being pursued.  Reviewers are urged not 
   to focus too much on certain details, or the inevitable roughness
   of their specification.  Attention to those details is promised
   with the next revision or two of this internet-draft.
