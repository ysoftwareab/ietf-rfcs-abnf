Abstract

   This memo defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM). It
   assigns and registers an initial set of OBJECT IDENTITIES to
   currently defined metrics in the IETF.

   This memo also defines the rules for adding new IP Performance
   Metrics in the future, both those standardized inside and outside the
   IETF.

   IANA has been assigned to administer this new registry.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB
   objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579]
   and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

2.  Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  The IPPM Framework

   The IPPM Framework consists in four major components:

   o  A general framework for defining performance metrics described in
      the Framework for IP Performance Metrics RFC2330 [RFC2330];

   o  A set of standardized metrics, which conform to this framework.

   o  Emerging metrics which are being specified in respect of this
      framework;

   o  The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB for reporting the results of the measures
      and for interfacing heterogeneous measurement systems with
      management entities.


4.  Overview

   This memo defines a registry of the current metrics and a framework
   for the integration of future metrics for the following reasons:

   o  to permit metrics to be clearly referenced by MIB modules or other
      data models;

   o  Metrics identifiers are needed to allow measurement
      interoperability; As specification of new metrics is a continuous
      process, special care must be taken for the integration of future

Internet-Draft           IPPM metrics registry                  May 2004


      standardized metrics;

   o  As the intent of the IPPM WG is to cooperate with other
      appropriate standards bodies and other areas of IETF to promote
      consistent metrics, there is a need to permit registration of such
      metrics.


5.  IPPM metrics Registry framework

   MIB modules need to be able to precisely reference IPPM Metrics. The
   registry associates an OBJECT-IDENTITY with each metric. As an
   example Type-P-One-way-Delay and Type-P-One-way-Delay-Poisson-Stream
   have different OBJECT IDENTITIES.

   The registry has 3 main branches. The origin of the document
   determines the node which branch the metric is identified in:

   o  Metrics defined by IETF are identified in the 'ietf' tree;

   o  Metrics defined in cooperation with other organizations may be
      identified in the 'otherOrganizations' tree.

   o  Vendors may register private metrics in the 'enterprises' tree.

   This document defines an initial registry of the existing metrics and
   the rules to manage the registry.

   Documents defining metrics in the future will include in the IANA
   section the registration information to unambiguously identify these
   metrics.

6.  Initial IPPM metrics registry creation

   The initial registry identifies the metrics currently defined in the
   RFCs produced in the IPPM WG. By now, the IPPM WG defined 33 metrics
   related to 7 topics:

   o  IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [RFC2678];

   o  One-way Delay Metrics, RFC 2679  [RFC2679];

   o  One-way Packet Loss Metrics, RFC 2680 [RFC2680];

   o  Round-trip Delay Metrics, RFC 2681 [RFC2681];

   o  One-way Loss Pattern Sample Metrics, RFC 3357 [RFC3357];

Internet-Draft           IPPM metrics registry                  May 2004


   o  IP Packet Delay Variation Metric, RFC 3393 [RFC3393];

   o  IPPM Metrics for periodic streams, RFC 3432 [RFC3432];


7.  IANA considerations

   This section describes the rules for the management of the registry
   by IANA.

7.1  Management rules

7.1.1  Naming Conventions

   The name of the metric in the registry must respect the SMIv2 rules
   for descriptors ([RFC2578], section 3.1) and should be easily
   readable. Consequently the following is applied to adapt the name
   used in the metric definition:

   o  The name always starts with the prefix of the organization.

   o  'Type-P' prefix is removed.

   o  '-' are removed;

   o  The letter following a '-' is changed to upper case;

   o  A node assigned to a metric is definitive and cannot be reused.

   o  If a new version of a metric is produced then it is assigned with
      a new name and a new identifier.


7.1.2  Metrics defined by IETF

   Such metrics are registered in the node ietf(1) after approval of the
   document by the IESG.

   The name always starts with the prefix 'ietf'. They are registered in
   the node ietf(1). They are numbered using the metrics definitions
   order in each memo.

7.1.3  Metrics defined in cooperation with other bodies

   After approval of the document by the IESG, IANA will assign the
   organization with a subtree under the branch otherOrganizations(2).

   The organization registers metrics under the branch



Stephan                Expires November 17, 2004                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           IPPM metrics registry                  May 2004


   otherOrganizations(2), in the corresponding subtree. The name of the
   metric always starts with the prefix of the organization. The prefix
   is the name of the subtree assigned to the organization.

   Nothing prevents these bodies from registering metrics in their own
   OBJECT INDENTIFIER trees.

7.1.4  Private Metrics registration

   IANA already assigns enterprises with unambiguous identifiers named
   enterprise numbers or vendorID. See http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.

   After approval of the document by the IESG, an enterprise may
   register private metrics under the branch enterprises(3), in the
   subtree corresponding to its enterprise number. The name of the
   metric always starts with the prefix of the company.

   The enterprise is responsible for the assignment of the number if its
   subtree.

   Example: The enterprise Acme,which enterprise number is 100000, will
   register its metrics in the subtree
   ippmMetricsRegistry(x).enterprises(3).100000.

7.2  Registration templates

   A document that creates new Metrics would have an IANA considerations
   section in which it would describe new metrics to register.

7.2.1  IETF RFCs

   For each metric, that section would have a statement aka:

   IANA has registed the following Metric in the IANA-IPPM-METRICS-MIB:

   	ietfSomeNewMetricName OBJECT-IDENTITY
   	   STATUS       current
   	   DESCRIPTION "The identifier for the Type-P-Some-New_Metric-Name
   					metric."
   	   REFERENCE   "RFCxxxx, section n."  -- RFC-Editor fills in xxxx
   	   ::=         { ietf nn }            -- IANA assigns nn

Internet-Draft           IPPM metrics registry                  May 2004


7.2.2  Other Organizations

   For each metric, that section would have a statement aka:

   IANA has registed the following Metric in the IANA-IPPM-METRICS-MIB:

   	orgSomeNewMetricName OBJECT-IDENTITY
   	   STATUS       current
   	   DESCRIPTION "The identifier for the Some-New_Metric-Name
   					metric."
   	   REFERENCE   "URL, section n."    -- link to the org document.
   	   ::=         { org nn }           -- org assigns nn




7.2.3  Enterprises

   For each metric, that section would have a statement aka:

   Vendor has registed the following Metric:

   	vendorSomeNewMetricName OBJECT-IDENTITY
   	   STATUS       current
   	   DESCRIPTION "The identifier for the Some-New_Metric-Name
   					metric."
   	   REFERENCE   "URL, section n."    -- link to the vendor document.
   	   ::=         { vendorID nn }      -- vendor assigns nn

9.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   assigns a set of OBJECT-IDENTITIES which may be used by other MIB
   modules to identify specific IP Performance Metrics.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects. This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
