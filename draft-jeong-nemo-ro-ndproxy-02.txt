Abstract 
    
   This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes in IPv6 
   mobile network to perform route and DNS optimizations.  The route 
   optimization is possible because mobile router relays the prefix of 
   its care-of address to its mobile nodes by playing the role of ND-
   proxy.  Through binding updates associated with the network prefix of 
   an access network, the mobile nodes can perform route optimization.  
   In addition, this document explains how mobile nodes can optimize its 
   DNS name resolution through RA-based DNS discovery.  By announcing 
   the address of local recursive DNS server, mobile router allows 
   mobile nodes using the DNS server to optimize their DNS name 
   resolutions without additional overhead of finding DNS server.

2. Introduction 
    
   Recently, the demand and necessity of network mobility (NEMO) [3] is 
   increasing along with those of host mobility based on Mobile IPv6 
   (MIPv6) [9].  The purpose of network mobility is to guarantee the 
   continuity of the sessions of fixed nodes or mobile nodes (MN) within 
   mobile networks, such as car, bus, subway train, airplane and 
   submarine.  The current solution is based on bi-directional tunnel 
   between home agent (HA) and mobile router (MR) [3].  The basic 
   support protocol of NEMO enables mobile network node (MNN) [7] and 
   correspondent node (CN) to communicate through the bi-directional 
   tunnel.  Data exchange between MNN and CN is performed not via 
   optimal routing path, but via the non-optimal path including bi-
   directional tunnel.  MR's HA intercepts all of packets destined to 
   the MNNs and tunnels them to the MR.  Also, the MNNs' outbound 
   packets are tunneled in order to pass ingress filtering [3][9].  This 
   mechanism is very simple but it gives up a powerful feature of MIPv6, 
   route optimization (RO) without ingress filtering.  In addition, when 
   the mobile network has multiple nested MRs, packet delay between MNN 
   and CN becomes longer because of dog-legged routing and also packet 
   size becomes bigger due to extra IPv6 header attached to packet per 
   level of nesting [10]. 
    
   When we think over the applicability of NEMO in our daily life, we 
   can forecast that network mobility service will be provided in 
   vehicles, such as bus, subway train and airplane, because most 
   passengers in such vehicles will have hand-held PC or PDA as MN 
   rather than fixed node in near future.  Therefore, it is necessary to 
   provide route optimization for such MNs.  This document describes a 
   way of optimizing the routes between MNs and CNs, independently of 
   the level of nesting and without the extra IPv6 header.  The route 
   optimization mechanism is based on the proxying function of MR, which 
   informs MNs within mobile network of the access network prefix to 
   make a care-of address (CoA) passing ingress filtering, and also 
   relays packets between access router and MN.  This proxying for RO is 
   performed through IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND), which is called ND-
   Proxy.

    Figure 1. Multilink Subnet for Route Optimization 
    
   The route optimization is possible by MR's performing ND-Proxy, which 
   makes a CoA with the prefix advertised by access router and relays 
   the prefix of access network into the whole mobile network.  Each MN 
   can make its new CoA with router advertisement message including 
   access network prefix and perform the return routability and binding 
   update procedure.  As ND-Proxy, the MR performs neighbor discovery 
   for the sake of the MNs within its mobile network.  Like this, 
   through MR that performs ND-Proxy, access network and mobile network 
   are configured into a multilink subnet.  Figure 1 shows an example of 
   a multilink subnet comprised of four links from Link1 to Link4.  Two 
   MRs, MR1 and MR2, receive the prefix information of access network 
   (AR1_P) that was sent by an access router, AR1 as proxy-mode and 
   relay it to their subnet link as router-mode [6].  Let's assume that 
   the MNs, MN1 and MN2, move into the mobile network managed by MR1 
   like Figure 1.   Also, let's assume that these visiting mobile nodes 
   (VMN) communicate with the correspondent nodes, CN1 and CN2,

   respectively.  If these visiting mobiles can get the prefix of access 
   network and make their new CoA, through the binding update with their 
   correspondent node, they can communicate each other via an optimized 
   path.  This dissemination of access network's prefix is performed by 
   MR which becomes attached to a foreign access network, not its home 
   network.  Likewise, MN3 can optimize the route through MR2.  MN4 and 
   MN5 can perform route optimization through MR2 and MR3, too. 
    
   The optimization of DNS name resolution is possible by MR's 
   announcing the address of local recursive DNS server as well as the 
   prefix information of access network.  In Figure 1, by DNS Server 
   option included in RA message, MR1 announces the address of Recursive 
   DNS Server, RDNSS1, within its mobile network to its router-mode link, 
   Link2.  Therefore, MNs within Link2, MN1 and MN2, can optimize their 
   DNS name resolution by using local DNS server, RDNSS1. 
    
4. Neighbor Discovery extension 
    
   In order to support the route optimization, ND implementation in MR 
   and MN must be extended to process the prefix information option for 
   RO and that in Local Fixed Node (LFN) within mobile network, which 
   has no mechanism for MIPv6, need no change. 
    
4.1 RO Prefix Information option format 
    
   The mechanism of this document needs a new O (Route-optimization) 
   flag within prefix information option for route optimization [4].  
   When this flag is set on, it indicates that the prefix included in 
   the option can be used by MNs within a mobile network for route 
   optimization.  Figure 2 shows the format of the modified prefix 
   information option, RO Prefix Information option, which is included 
   in RA message.

      O            1-bit route-optimization flag.  When set indicates 
                   that this prefix can be used for the route 
                   optimization of MNs within a mobile network. 
    
   The RO Prefix Information option provides an MN with the network 
   prefix of access network and allows it to autoconfigure its new CoA 
   through stateless address autoconfiguration and to perform binding 
   update.  The Prefix Information option appears in RA message and MUST 
   be silently ignored for other messages.  L (On-link) flag MAY be 
   either 0 or 1.  Namely, this route optimization can be either on-link 
   or off-link model [6].  A (Autonomous address-configuration) flag 
   MUST be set on, indicating IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration. 
    
4.2 Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message format 
    
   NS message MUST be extended for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for 
   the address based on RO prefix to be performed in the whole mobile 
   network, not just within a link.  Therefore, there is a need to 
   discriminate between the normal NS message and extended NS message 
   for route optimization [4].  Figure 3 shows the format of the 
   modified NS message.

      Length          8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the 
                      option (including the type and length fields) 
                      in units of 8 octets SHOULD be 0x03 (3 x 8 = 24 
                      octets). 
    
      Pref            The preference of a DNS server.  A 4-bit unsigned 
                      integer.  A decimal value of 15 indicates the 
                      highest preference.  A decimal value of zero 
                      means unspecified.  The field can be used for 
                      load balancing of DNS queries with multiple 
                      RDNSSes according to local policy. 
       
      Lifetime        32-bit unsigned integer.  The maximum time, in 
                      seconds, over which this DNS server is used for 
                      name resolution.  MNs should contact the 
                      source of this information, MR, before 
                      expiry of this time interval.  A value of all one 
                      bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity.  A value 
                      of zero means that the DNS server must not be 
                      used any more. 
    
      IPv6 Address of DNS Server 
                      Recursive DNS Server's address for DNS name 
                      resolution. 
    
5. Mobile Router 
    
   MR MUST process Prefix Information option for Route Optimization and 
   DNS Server option for DNS Optimization, which may be included in RA 
   message. 
    
5.1 Process of RO Prefix Information option 
    
   Only if the prefix announced by an access router is different from 
   the prefix of an MR's Home Address (HoA), the MR MUST perform the 
   role of ND-Proxy and relay the prefix information.  Before MR 
   advertises the prefix information through Router Advertisement (RA) 
   message, it MUST set O flag indicating that this prefix can be used 
   for route optimization of MNs, which are either local mobile nodes 
   (LMN) or VMNs within the mobile network. 
    
   If an MN within a mobile network receives the new prefix information 
   option through RA message and can recognize this option, it MAY 
   prefer RO prefix information option to normal prefix information 
   option that contains the mobile network prefix assigned by the MR's 
   home network.  By performing binding update with the prefix of the 
   access network, the MN can optimize the routes between its 
   correspondent nodes and itself.

Internet-Draft  ND-Proxy based Route & DNS Optimizations  February 2004 
 
 
    
   ND-Proxy MUST join the solicited-node multicast addresses that   
   correspond to the IPv6 addresses assigned to MNs for which it is 
   proxying for processing ND messages related to the MNs [4]. 
    
5.2 Process of DNS Server option 
    
   If MR has its own local RDNSS like MR1 and MR2 in Figure 1, it SHOULD 
   announce the address of RDNSS to its router-mode link(s). 
    
   If MR receives DNS Server option from its proxy-mode link(s), it 
   SHOULD relay the option to its router-mode link(s) through its RA 
   message.  In the case where MR has its own local RDNSS, it announces 
   the DNS Server option of its RDNSS with higher precedence than those 
   of other RDNSSes. 
    
5.3 Delivery of Data Packets 
    
   After an MN gets a new CoA within a mobile network and performs 
   binding update associated with the address, the data packets of 
   correspondent node toward the MN can be delivered to the access 
   network to which the mobile network containing the MN is attached, 
   via optimal path between the mobile and correspondent nodes. 
    
   When the access router of the access network receives the data 
   packets toward an MN and there is no neighbor information for the MN, 
   it multicasts normal Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message to the 
   solicited-node multicast address of the destination IPv6 address in 
   order to find out the link-layer address of the destination MN.  The 
   MR, knowing the link-layer address of the target, responds to the NS 
   message by returning its own link-layer address in a unicast Neighbor 
   Advertisement (NA) message as ND-Proxy, which knows the IPv6 
   addresses and link-layer addresses of MNs within its mobile network 
   while forwarding their data packets along with neighbor discovery 
   related to each destination node. 
    
   When the access router knows the link-layer address of next-hop 
   toward the destination MN, it forwards the IPv6 data packets to the 
   MR corresponding to the link-layer address.  The packets are relayed 
   to next-hop toward the destination node by MR until the packets 
   arrive at the destination.  Like this, in the case where the mobile 
   network where the destination node is placed is multi-level, the 
   packets may be relayed to the destination node by more than one MR 
   according to the route information in each MR's destination and 
   neighbor caches. 
    
5.4 Movement of Mobile Router

   When an MR moves into another access network and detects its movement 
   by movement detection algorithm [9], it performs binding update with 
   its HA with a new CoA based on the new access network prefix, and 
   then relays the prefix for RO into its other router-mode interfaces.  
   This allows the MRs and nodes to perform route optimization based on 
   the new access network prefix.  When the MR returns to its home 
   network, it deregisters with its HA and advertises RA message that 
   contains RO Prefix Information option for the previous access network 
   prefix with Valid Lifetime and Preferred Lifetime set to zeroes and O 
   flag set on, and also Prefix Information option for MR's mobile 
   network prefix.  The RO Prefix Information option SHOULD be 
   advertised at least three times.  This RA message allows the MRs and 
   MNs below the MR explicitly to release their current CoA and to use 
   the MR's mobile network prefix in order to configure their addresses 
   according to MIPv6 protocol [9]. 
    
6. Mobile Node 
    
   MN MUST process Prefix Information option for RO and DNS Server 
   option for DNS Optimization, which are included in RA message. 
    
6.1 Procedure of Route Optimization 
    
   For RO, MN generates a new CoA based on the access network prefix and 
   performs binding update for the CoA. 
    
6.1.1 Generation of a new CoA 
    
   Whenever an MN receives RA message containing RO prefix information 
   option that includes a new network prefix of access network, it makes 
   a new CoA. 
    
6.1.2 DAD for the new CoA 
    
   The MN performs DAD for the new CoA through the extended NS message.  
   The NS message of DAD for the new address is disseminated by MRs, 
   acting as ND-Proxy, in the entire mobile network where the MN is 
   placed [6].  Each MR memorizes the DAD for returning NA message to 
   the originator or relayer of the extended NS message for a while. 
    
   If there is no NA returned after DAD timeout, the MN configures the 
   address as its new CoA in its network interface. 
    
   Therefore, the DAD for the link-local addresses and global addresses 
   based on mobile network prefix assigned by home network is performed 
   through normal NS message only within a link and the DAD for the 
   global addresses based on access network prefix is performed through

Internet-Draft  ND-Proxy based Route & DNS Optimizations  February 2004 
 
 
   extended NS message within a multilink subnet, which is relayed by 
   ND-Proxies. 
    
6.1.3 Return Routability and Binding Update 
    
   After configuring the new CoA, the MN performs the return routability 
   and binding update procedure of MIPv6 [9].  If the MN is VMN for the 
   mobile network where it is present, or as LMN, moves into another 
   link of the mobile network to which its home link belongs, it SHOULD 
   perform binding updates with both its HA and CNs. 
    
6.2 Procedure of DNS Optimization 
 
   The optimization of DNS name resolution is possible by MR's 
   announcing the address of local RDNSS along with RO prefix 
   information through RA message like in Section 5.2 [8].  The DNS 
   server can exist either within mobile network or within access 
   network.  The address of RDNSS is delivered to MNs through DNS Server 
   option, one of RA options.  Especially, VMNs can optimize their DNS 
   name resolutions effectively by using a local RDNSS. 
 
7. Security Considerations 
    
   The route optimization and DNS optimization in this document does not 
   add any other security problems to the NEMO, MIPv6, or ND protocol.  
   Security issues regarding the ND protocol are being discussed in IETF 
   SEND (Securing Neighbor Discovery) working group [11].
