Abstract

   JSON Web Document (JWD) is a means of representing optionally signed
   and/or encrypted JSON content suitable for storage, retrieval,
   transmission, and display in a graphical user interface.  The content
   of a JWD is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS)
   structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
   structure.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   JWD introduces a new set of serializations to JWS and JWE called the
   Document Serializations.  These serializations follow the form of the
   JSON Serialization and Flattened JSON Serialization described in JWS
   Section 7.2 [1], except that the payload, integrity-protected header,
   and non-integrity-protected header contents are all represented as
   unencoded JSON values and MUST NOT be base64url-encoded.

   Signatures present in the data structure MUST be base64url-encoded.
   Signatures are computed using base64url-encoded JSON values for the
   payload and integrity-protected headers as in JWS.  For a given
   payload and JOSE Header, the signature(s) of a JWD MUST be identical
   to signatures computed for semantically equivalent JWT
   serializations.

2.  Terminology

   This specification uses terms defined in the JSON Web Token [JWT],
   JSON Web Signature [JWS], and JSON Web Encryption [JWE]
   specifications.

   These terms are defined by this specification:

         A data structure representing a digitally signed, MACed, or
         encrypted JSON document.

      JWS Document Serialization

         A representation of the JWD as a JSON document.  Unlike the JWS
         JSON Serialization, the JWS Document Serialization represents
         the JWS Payload and integrity-protected JOSE Header parameters
         as unencoded JSON values.  This representation simplifies
         storage and retrieval of signed content with document stores
         and search engines, as well as display in applications.
