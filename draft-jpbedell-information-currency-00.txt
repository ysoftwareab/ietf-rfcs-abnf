1.  Introduction

   Economics deals with the allocation of scarce goods and services [1].
   Monetary systems, used by humans since prehistoric times, provide
   instruments that serve as a store of economic value and the medium of
   exchange in economic transactions.  Networked computer systems
   present the opportunity to create new instruments of economic
   scarcity which are based solely on arbitrary units of information
   that can be exchanged and uniquely identified as being part of a
   limited series.  These instruments of economic scarcity can be used
   in market-based processes to aggregate individual estimates of value
   into a collective valuation of the underlying information, and will
   enable the application of modern economic engineering principles to
   the management of information.  By analogy with existing currency
   systems, information currency is the name given to instruments of
   economic scarcity which are based solely on information and the
   operation of information systems, instead of physical assets such as
   gold or silver, or other assets underlying the value of modern
   currencies.

   This approach is targeted, in particular, to enabling new economic
   incentives for the creation of information that is freely shared,
   such as open-source software code[2] and open-access scientific
   information[3][4].  In such a case, while the underlying information
   is freely available on the global Internet, the instruments of
   economic scarcity representing the open-source content can be held by
   the creators and traded in mutually beneficial exchanges.  It is
   expected that the value of information currencies representing widely
   available and highly useful information will appreciate over time,
   providing a quantitative representation of the significance of the
   underlying information as well as a new motivation for the creators
   of freely-available information.

   This document describes the initial realization of information
   currency systems as implemented in the Information Currency Web
   Services (ICWS) system[5], with the goal of enabling interoperable
   implementations of economic information management systems.  While
   the principles underlying the implementation of information currency
   systems are quite general, the discussion that follows will focus on
   their specific realization within the ICWS system.

2.  Information Currency Systems

   The basic principle behind the concept of information currency
   systems is the representation of an underlying unit of information by
   economically scarce instruments that can be traded between
   individuals.  This 'unit' of underlying information can take a
   variety of forms, including direct representations (e.g.  a person's
   name and/or email address), uniform resource locators (URLs) of
   network-available resources such as web pages, or any combination of
   these or other representations.  An authoritative server can issue a
   number of instruments of economic scarcity to represent its
   perception of the underlying information.  The recipients of the
   instruments can then use those instruments in trades with other
   individuals to establish a valuation for the underlying information
   in a manner similar to the means by which currently existing economic
   instruments are valued.

   In addition, the twin premises of economic scarcity and lasting value
   for the issued instruments provide a motivation for the issuer to
   maintain system security, and will enable the ready evaluation of the
   issuer's credibility and integrity by potential customers.  This is a
   mechanism by which the security of information systems may be
   quantitatively assessed, and will enable the ongoing comparative
   valuation of information security services provided by networked
   service providers.

   Information currency systems are based on documents presented using
   XML [6] for interoperability between implementations.  In the
   following, we describe the documents used to represent information
   currency systems and the documents used to create and manage
   information currency systems.

2.1  Information Currency Units

   The fundamental instrument of economic scarcity is the information
   currency unit.  In the current implementation, this is an
   XML-formatted document which provides the secret information which is
   the basis for the currency unit, a cryptographic signature of the
   secret information, and an identifier for the series from which the
   information currency unit is derived.

   An example of an information currency unit follows:

   ---------- END INFORMATION CURRENCY UNIT ----------

   The <ci> element contains the certification information that uniquely
   identifies the information currency unit.  This information is
   presented using Base64[7] encoding of the bytes that provide the
   underlying value.

   The <sig> element contains the signature of the certification
   information that is generated using the public/private cryptographic
   keypair associated with the information currency system.  This
   provides a mechanism for verifying that a particular information
   currency unit is part of the series associated with the cryptographic
   keys.

   The <sid> element is the uniform resource locator which serves as a
   string to identify the series and a pointer to the series information
   document which provides the parameters of the series.

2.2  Series Information Document

   An example of a series information document is the following:

   In the document above, the series indentifier is within the
   <seriesID> element, and provides a resource locator for the series
   information document as well as providing a unique string for
   identifying the series.  The <serviceEndpoint> element provides, in
   the current implementation, the network location for SOAP[8]
   messages, as described below, to perform currency operations.

   The series title element, with the <seriesTitle> tag, contains the
   description of the series, and in this case provides a verbal
   description of the information underlying the information currency

   series.  In this case, the title describes the intention of the
   issuer that the series represents the portion of the value of the
   resource contributed by the work of 'John Smith
   <jsmith@example.com>'.

   The <certificateNumber> element provides the total number of
   certificates in the series.  The initial implementation of
   information currency systems allows only for series with a fixed
   number of units within the series, although systems for ongoing
   issuance of information currency are possible.  The <numberBytes>
   element provides the number of bytes in each information currency
   unit that comprises the information currency series.

   The <createdTime> and <expiresTime> elements provide the times at
   which the information currency series was created and at which it
   expires.  By convention, this time is specified in the universal
   coordinated time scale (UTC).

   The <signingKeyInfo> element provides the cryptographic key
   information for the signatures within the information currency
   system.  In the example, the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)[9] is
   used to create the signatures of the individual information currency
   units, and the DSA generator, prime, and subprime values.

   The <underlyingInformation> element contains the
   <InformationIdentifiers> that the series is based on.  For
   information currency systems that are based on publicly available
   information, <InformationIdentifier> elements provide identifiers for
   the underlying information.  In the case of a network resource, such
   as a web page, this is a uniform resource locator for the underlying
   information and the digest value associated with the processing of
   the information.  In the current implementation, there is no
   transform of the underlying information, as in the XML-Signature
   specification[12], and the digest value is simply generated from the
   bytes received by querying the network resource.

3.  Currency Operations

   The first implementation of information currency systems provides a
   SOAP interface to the issuance of information currency.  The most
   important operations, described here, are currency issuance, currency
   exchange, and currency verification.

3.1  Currency Issuance

   Currency issuance is the process of generating and returning new
   information currency units based on information submitted by a user.
   In the ICWS system, the certification operation is performed by the
   processing of a <CertificationRequest> document delivered over a SOAP
   connection.

   A certification request for the series above is shown here:

   ---------- BEGIN CERTIFICATION REQUEST ----------
   <CertificationRequest>
     <InformationIdentifier>
       <underlierLocator>https://www.example.com/sampleResource</underlierLocator>
       <digestValue>225804242120f941e8196a548025fb0e3b9e761c</digestValue>
     </InformationIdentifier>
     <InformationIdentifier>
       <underlierLocator>John Smith <jsmith@example.com></underlierLocator>
       <digestValue>c8bf8edc67aff55e95b17782e4dfbba14a31f3ef</digestValue>
     </InformationIdentifier>
     <title>Contribution of John Smith <jsmith@example.com> to the sample resource.</title>
     <userCertificate>
       (userCertificateText)
     </userCertificate>
   </CertificationRequest>
   ---------- END CERTIFICATION REQUEST ----------

   In the request above, the (userCertificateText) is replaced by the
   content of a cryptographic certificate (such as a X.509[10] or
   SDSI/SPKI[11] certificate) providing authentication, with
   authorization for issuance having been previously associated with the
   cryptographic key used for authentication.

   The number of information currency units returned after processing
   the certification request is determined by the settings of the
   issuer.  The issuer will, in general, reserve a certain number of
   information currency units from the issued series as 'payment' for
   the issuance.

Internet-Draft        Information Currency Systems         February 2005


3.2  Currency Exchange

   The sole possession of information currency units is equivalent to
   their secrecy, and the value of information currencies is based on
   their scarcity.  Therefore, when information currency units have been
   exchanged between individuals in a market trade, it is necessary to
   exchange those information currency units with the issuer so that the
   original ICUs can be invalidated and new ones can be issued in their
   place.

   The current implementation of information currency (ICWS) uses a SOAP
   message to exchange information currency units, with one SOAP field
   used for the information currency unit, and the second SOAP field
   used for the certificate authorizing the exchange and attributing
   ownership.  In the current implementation, the user authentication is
   unnecessary and an information currency unit can be exchanged and
   returned with the authentication field empty.

   The result of the certificate exchange operation, starting with the
   information currency unit above, is shown below:

   ---------- END NEWLY ISSUED INFORMATION CURRENCY UNIT ----------

   The newly issued information currency unit is recognized by the
   issuer as valid, while the previous information currency unit is no
   longer accepted as valid by the issuer.

3.3  Currency Verification

   In order to verify with the issuer of an information currency series
   that an information currency unit is valid, a verification
   certificate is prepared based on the content of the information
   currency unit.  The certification information from the information
   currency unit is digested and placed in a <digestValue> element, and
   the series ID is placed in a <sid> element, for a document with a
   root element of <VerificationCertificate>, as shown here:

   ---------- BEGIN VERIFICATION CERTIFICATE ----------
   <VerificationCertificate>
     <sid>
       https://www.example.com:8443/icws/seriesInfo?seriesID=3e0e420f7960e54bda67e443d964d0196882b00a
     </sid>
     <digestValue>
       yemGW612d6SCLEtC34JzQLKm+KI=
     </digestValue>
   </VerificationCertificate>
   ---------- END VERIFICATION CERTIFICATE ----------

   The issuer of the series, upon receipt of the verification
   certificate, can respond with a boolean indication of the
   certificate's validity.

   The fact that the verification certificate uses a digest value means
   that a holder of an ICU can provide a third party with a verification
   certificate to demonstrate that they possess a valid ICU.  Upon

   receipt of the verification certificate, the third party can transmit
   the verification certificate to the ICU issuer for verification of
   validity.
