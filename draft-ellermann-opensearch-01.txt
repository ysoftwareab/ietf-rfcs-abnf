Internet-Draft           OpenSearch Description                July 2008


1.  Introduction

   OpenSearch descriptions are a way to specify the format of search
   queries and results for a given topic or purpose.  The [XML] format
   is supported by various user agents and search engines.  Simple
   OpenSearch descriptions in essence specify the parameters of a Web
   form for a search query.

   A link "search" relation as used in Atom [RFC4287], HTML, XHTML, and
   HTTP [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header] allows auto-discovery of
   OpenSearch descriptions.  User agents supporting this feature will
   offer to "install" the search description, i.e. make it available
   together with other installed search descriptions independent of the
   contexts where those descriptions were found.

   Another way to install OpenSearch descriptions is to use a function
   such as "AddSearchProvider" supported by some Web browsers.  What
   such "installation" procedures actually do depends on the client
   software, e.g., they could replace the URI of an icon in the
   description by an equivalent "data:" URI [RFC2397] for privacy and
   other reasons.

1.1.  link rel="search" example

   The following example of a "search" relation in the <head> element of
   an XHTML document allows auto-discovery of an OpenSearch description
   with title "Demo search" at the URI <http://example.org/demo.xml>:

       <link rel="search"
             href="http://example.org/demo.xml"
             type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
             title="Demo search" />

1.2.  AddSearchProvider example

   A script might allow the installation.  The following XHTML example
   links to the OpenSearch description for manual inspection when the
   "onclick" approach is not supported:

       <a href="http://example.org/demo.xml"
          onclick="window.external.AddSearchProvider(
                        'http://example.org/demo.xml'); return false"
          title="Add Search Provider">Demo search</a>

   The "AddSearchProvider" function is not specified in this memo.  For
   a discussion of "onclick" event handlers and the HTTP header field
   Content-Script-Language see a relevant specification, e.g., [XHTML].

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD - this is a DRAFT, see "Status of this Memo" above


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  link rel="search"

   Below you find the [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header] registration
   template for the link "search" relation under
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/>:

   Relation name:  search

   Description:    a related search resource such as an OpenSearch
                   description

   Reference:      RFCXXXX

5.2.  application/opensearchdescription+xml

   Below you find the [RFC4288] registraton template for the subtype
   "opensearchdescription+xml" of the "application" media type under
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/>:

   Type name:      application

   Subtype name:   opensearchdescription+xml

   Required parameters:
                   There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:
                   charset (defaults to "UTF-8")

Internet-Draft           OpenSearch Description                July 2008


   Encoding considerations:
                   Identical to those of "application/xml" as described
                   in [RFC3023]; especially "UTF-8" [RFC3629] and its
                   proper subset "US-ASCII" are supposed to work.
                   For non-ASCII documents served as "text/xml" the
                   "charset" parameter is required; this might be
                   relevant when authors are unable to configure the
                   server hosting their OpenSearch descriptions.

   Security considerations:
                   All general security and privacy considerations for
                   sending queries to servers specified in an URL are
                   applicable.  See RFCXXXX Section 4 for more info.

   Interoperability considerations:
                   OpenSearch descriptions use the
                   <http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/> XML name
                   space, optionally in conjunction with other XML name
                   spaces for extensions or for application specific
                   purposes.

   Published specification:
                   RFCXXXX, <http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications>

   Applications that use this media type:
                   Various search cients including popular Web browsers,
                   search engines, and software libraries support
                   OpenSearch descriptions.

   Additional information:
                   TBD

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
                   TBD

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:
                   TBD

   Author:         TBD

   Change controller:
                   IETF

Appendix A.  Document History

   Changes in version 01:

   o  Move registry cleanup from Section 5 to the (hopefully) next
      [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].

   o  Adopt registration template in [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header]
      replacing the similar [RFC4287] template.

   o  Some background info with examples parked in the introduction.

   Changes in version 00:

   o  This is a kind of template that could be extended to register
      rel="search" and application/opensearchdescription+xml if the
      OpenSearch community likes this approach.

   o  The change controller for a media type in the standards tree has
      to be a SDO (Standards Development Organization) recognized by the
      IESG or IAB on behalf of the IETF community, not necessarily the
      IETF itself.

   o  For atom:link relations IESG review is good enough.  Informational
      IETF RFCs are approved by the IESG in a "document action", this
      would trigger the IANA considerations in Section 5.
