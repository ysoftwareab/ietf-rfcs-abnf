Abstract

   RFC 3270 defines the iSCSI protocol and allows for extension
   items to the protocol in the form of Private or Public Extension
   Keys.  This Internet-Draft describes a Public Extension Key for
   the purpose of enhancing iSCSI supportability.  The key
   accomplishes this objective by allowing iSCSI nodes to
   communicate architecture details during the iSCSI login
   sequence.  The receiving node can then use this information
   for enhanced logging and support.

1.  Introduction

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

1.2  Overview

   This Internet-Draft describes a declarative Public Extension
   Key as defined by section 12.22 of RFC 3720 that may be used to
   communicate additional iSCSI node information to the opposite
   node in a session.  The information carried in the described
   key has been found to be valuable in real iSCSI customer
   environments as initiator and target vendors collaborate to
   resolve technical issues and better understand the evolving
   iSCSI market.

   The key has been modelled after the "Server" and "User-Agent"
   header fields as specified in sections 14.38 and 14.43 of RFC
   2616, with the text-value(s) of the key roughly equivalent to
   Product Tokens in section 3.8 of RFC 2616.  Note however that
   the text-value(s) in the keys list-of-values MUST conform to
   the Text Format as specified in section 5.1 of RFC 3720.

   The following described Public Extension Key is sent during
   the login phase of an iSCSI normal session.  It is important
   to note that the proper use of this key is to provide enhanced
   logging and support capabilities, and for better understanding
   of customer environments.  The key MUST NOT be used by iSCSI
   nodes for things such as interoperability, performance,
   exclusion or deception of other nodes, or other uses not
   defined here.  To enforce proper use, iSCSI nodes MUST NOT
   allow user modification of the key value(s), and SHOULD set
   the value automatically based on standard internal interfaces.

2.  Definition

   The definition of extension the key is as follows, with example
   list-of-values conforming to section 5.1 of RFC 3720.

X#NodeArchitecture

   Use: LO, Declarative
   Senders: Initiator and Target
   Scope: SW

   X#NodeArchitecture=<list-of-values>

   Examples:

      X#NodeArchitecture="iscsi-vendor-software/1.2.3.4,os/1.2.3.4"
      X#NodeArchitecture="iscsi-vendor-hardware/1.2.3.4,
                          iscsi-vendor-firmware/1.2.3.4,
                          os/1.2.3.4,cpu-type-x,cpu-speed/2.0ghz"

   The initiator or target declares the details of its iSCSI node
   architecture to the remote endpoint.  These details may include,
   but are not limited to, iSCSI vendor software, firmware, or
   hardware versions, the OS version, or hardware architecture.

   X#NodeArchitecture MUST NOT be redeclared.

3.  Security Considerations 

   In certain environments where security is a primary concern,
   the use of this extension key may not be appropriate as it
   reveals specific details about an iSCSI node. For these
   environments, nodes implementing this public extension key
   SHOULD provide a method to disable sending the key.

4.  IANA Considerations 

   This document defines the iSCSI Extension Key NodeArchitecture 
   to be registered in the IANA iSCSI extended key registry.
