1.  Introduction

   The Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Mobility Management [HMIPv6] did not
   specify nor favor any particular mechanism for establishing a
   Security Association (SA) between the Mobile Node (MN) and the
   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) located within an HMIPv6 domain.

   This memo describes a method allowing to establish an SA between the
   MN and the selected MAP.  The suggested solution is based on using
   the Cryptographically Generated Addresses [CGA] technology.

3.  Glossary

   Access Router

      The Access Router is the Mobile Node's default router.  The AR
      aggregates the outband traffic of mobile nodes.

   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP)

      A Mobility Anchor Point is a router located in a network visited
      by the mobile node, which is used by the MN as a local Home Agent
      (HA).

   Regional Care-of Address (RCoA)

      A Regional Care-of Address is an address obtained by the MN from
      the visited network.  An RCoA is an address on the MAP's subnet
      and is auto-configured by the MN when receiving the MAP option.

   On-link Care-of Address (LCoA)

      The LCoA is the on-link CoA configured on a mobile node's
      interface based on the prefix advertised by its default router.

   Local Binding Update (LBU) Message

      The MN sends a Local Binding Update message to the MAP in order to
      establish a binding between the RCoA and the LCoA.

   Pre-Binding Update (PBU) Message

      The MN's default router sends a Pre-Binding Update message to the
      MAP upon receiving a Router Solicitation (RtSol) message carrying
      a 128-bit CBID and a valid CGA signature.

   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA)

      A technique described in [CGA] whereby an IPv6 address of a node
      is cryptographically generated by using a one-way hash function
      from the node's public key (Kp) and some other parameters.

   Binding Acknowledgment (BA) Message

      The MAP sends a binding acknowledgment message to the MN in
      response to an LBU message.

4.  Proposed Solution

   We assume that the MN's LCoA is always computed based on the CGA
   technology, in order to allow the MN to run the secure neighbor
   discovery protocol described in [SEND].  Such assumption has also
   been made in [FMIPsec], in order to provide a security mechanism for
   the [FMIPv6] protocol and in the [OptiSEND] protocol, in order to
   optimize SEND.

   In addition, we assume that the MN can discover the presence of an
   HMIPv6 domain before sending a RtSol message, e.g., by using
   technologies described in [FRD].  However, the proposed solution
   works with the same performance without such assumption.  In fact,
   our motivation behind suggesting the FRD protocol aims above all to
   reduce the handoff latency.

   The suggested solution introduces a new signaling message, i.e., the
   Pre-Binding Update (PBU) message, which is sent by the AR to the MAP
   upon receiving a RtSol message from the MN, which carries a valid
   signature (i.e., the message is signed with the MN's CGA private key)
   and a 128-bit CBID.

   The following figure shows the signaling diagram for establishing a
   bidirectional SA between the MN and the MAP:

   1.  MN to AR:  Router Solicitation [CGA Signature] (RtSol)
   2a. AR to MN:  Router Acknowledgement [Ks] (RtAdv)
   2b. AR to MAP: Pre-Binding Update [Ks + LCoA + CBID] (PBU)
   3.  MN to MAP: Local Binding Update [DH value (X)] (LBU)
   4.  MAP to MN: Binding Acknowledgment [HKs + DH value (Y)] (BA)

   The suggested solution is described in the following steps:

   o  the MN configures a 64-bit interface identifier (IID) from using
      CGA technology then use it to send a RtSol message, which is
      signed as described in SEND.  Note that at this stage, the MN may
      or may not be aware that it has entered an HMIPv6 domain.

   o  Upon receiving a valid unicast RtSol message, the AR replies
      immediately by sending a unicast RtAdv message to the MN and in
      parallel, a PBU message to the MAP.  For this purpose, the AR MUST
      compute a secret (Ks), encrypts it with the MN's CGA public key
      and sends it in the unicast RtAdv message.  The shared secret is
      inserted in a new option (Third Party Shared Key (TSPK)), which is
      carried by the unicast RtAdv message.
      The AR MUST also compute the LCoA and RCoA that the MN is supposed
      to autoconfigure.  For this purpose, the LCoA is computed by
      appending the 64-bit IID used in the RtSol message to the 64-bit

Internet-Draft                  HMIPv6sec                       May 2006


      prefix advertised by the AR while the RCoA is computed by
      appending the 64-bit prefix advertised by the MAP with the 64-bit
      IID computed in the following way:

      RCoA (IID) = First (64, SHA1(Ks | LCoA))

      Where First(x,y) is a function, which extracts the first x bits
      from y and LCoA is the MN's on link care-of address.

      After computing the MN's LCoA and RCoA, the AR inserts the two
      addresses and Ks in the PBU message and sends it to the MAP.  Note
      that it is assumed that the PBU messages are signed by the ARs and
      the paths between the ARs and the MAP are secure.

   o  After receiving the PBU message, the MAP creates a BCE for the MN,
      in which it stores the LCoA, RCoA and Ks carried by the PBU
      message.  Once the BCE is created, the MAP waits for a limited
      amount of time for the owner of the two addresses to send the LBU
      message.

   o  When the MN gets a valid RtAdv message, it discovers that it has
      entered an HMIPv6 domain.  The following is based on the
      assumption that the MN decides to use the MAP as its local Home
      Agent.  For this purpose, the MN configures its RCoA by using the
      same method as the AR and its LCoA by appending its CGA 64-bit IID
      to the 64-bit prefix advertised by the AR.  Then, it initiates a
      Diffie-Hellman (DH) procedure with the MAP by sending its DH
      public value (X) in a new option (Session Mobility Secret (SMS)),
      which is carried by the first LBU message sent to the MAP.  The
      first LBU message is also used to request the MAP to bind its LCoA
      to its new RCoA.

   o  Upon receiving an LBU message, the MAP searches its BCEs table for
      an LCoA, which matches the one sent in the LBU message.  If the
      same LCoA is found, then the MAP computes the RCoA IID in the same
      way as described above, and compares it to the one claimed by the
      MN in the LBU message.  If the two addresses are the same, then
      the MAP completes the DH exchange by sending its own DH public
      value (Y) in a new option (MAP Session Mobility Secret (MSMS)),
      which is carried by the BA message sent to the MN.  In addition,
      the MAP MUST send in the BA message the hash of Ks (i.e., hash(Ks)
      = HKs), which will be carried in another new option (Third Party
      Hash Secret (TPHS)).

      By sending (Y) to the MN, the MAP will complete the DH exchange,
      which in turn allows both nodes to compute the session mobility
      key (Ksm), i.e., from values (X) and (Y).
      Note that if the two IPv6 addresses are not identical then the MAP

      MUST simply discard the LBU message.

   o  When the MN gets a BA message, it searches first if it carries
      HKs.  If the correct HKs is found, then the MN computes Ksm and
      establishes a bidirectional SA with the MAP.

   o  Finally, both nodes MUST use Ksm only to authenticate all
      subsequent LBU/BA messages exchanged between them.

   Note that the SA lifetime is set to 24 hours, after which the MN has
   to request the MAP to renew it.

5.  New Messages and Options Format

   In the following, we describe the PBU message structure and the
   format of the four new options.

5.1.  The Pre-Binding Update (PBU) Message Format

   When the AR receives a RtSol message carrying a valid RSA signature
   and a CBID, it sends a PBU message to the MAP, which carries the MN's
   LCoA, CGA public key, CBID and Ks.

   The format of the PBU message is as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3

   Option Data
   The Option Data field contains the DH public value (Y) sent by the
   MAP to the MN in the BA message.

5.4.  Third Party Hash Secret (TPHS) Option

   When sending a BA message carrying an MSS option, the MAP MUST insert
   the hash of Ks (HKs) in the BA message.  For this purpose, the TPHS
   option is used to carry the HKs in the BA message.

   The TPHS option has the following format:


     0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                     |  Option Type  | Option Length |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     .                    Option Data = HKs                          .
     |                                                               |

   Option Length
   Length of the option.

   Option Data
   The Option Data field contains the hash of Ks.

5.5.  The Session Mobility Secret (SMS) Option

   The SMS option is carried by the first LBU message sent by the MN to
   the MAP after receiving an unicast RtAdv message carrying a TPSK
   option.  The SMS option contains the DH public value (X) sent by the
   MN to the MAP to initiate a DH exchange, which will allow both nodes
   to compute a shared secret (Ksm).  Note that the first LBU message
   sent by the MN to the MAP MUST be authenticated with Ks.

   The SMS option has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                     |  Option Type  | Option Length |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     .                    Option Data = (X)                          .
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Option Type
   <To Be Assigned By IANA>

   Option Length
   Length of the option.

   Option Data
   The Option Data field contains the DH public value (X) sent by the MN
   to the MAP in the first LBU message.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces 4 new types of options and one new type of
   message.  The values of these types are 8-bit unsigned integers.
   These values are allocated according to the Standards Actions or IESG
   approval policies defined in [IANA].

7.  Security Considerations

   This proposal suggests using the CGA technology to secure the
   exchange between the MN and the AR as described in the SEND protocol
   to derive a first shared secret between the two entities and to use
   it later to authenticate mobility signaling messages exchanged
   between the MN and the MAP.  This is recommended due to the fact that
   public key signature is a computationally expensive and lengthy
   procedure.

   The suggested proposal does not create nor enhance any new and/or
   existing threats.  In particular, launching a man-in-the middle
   attack against the MN is not possible because the attacker is not
   aware of the shared secret Ks.  In addition, launching a denial of
   service (DoS) attack against the MAP or the MN is not easy due to the
   fact that both nodes can quickly scan incoming messages for a partial
   authenticity before processing the entire message.

8.  Change Log

   This document introduces the following changes from previous
   versions:

   - Remove the reliance on the crypto-based identifier (CBID) in order
   to further simplify the protocol.

   - Remove any new option from the RtSol message and adopt the same
   format as used in SEND.

   - Reduce the size of the PBU message by eliminating the need to send
   the MN's CGA public key.

   - Change the document title to reflect the new modifications.
