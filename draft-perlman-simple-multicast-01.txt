    Simple Multicast: A Design for Simple, Low-Overhead Multicast^M
            <draft-perlman-simple-multicast-01.txt>^M



Abstract


   This paper describes a design for multicast that is simple to
   understand and low enough overhead for routers that a single scheme
   can work both within and between domains. It also eliminates the need
   for coordinated multicast address allocation across the Internet. It
   is not very different from the tree based schemes CBT, PIM-SM, and
   BGMP. Essentially all of the mechanisms to support this have already
   been implemented in the other designs. The contribution of this
   protocol is in what is NOT required to be implemented.

   The main idea for simplifying multicast is to consider the identity
   of a group to be the 8-byte combination of a 'core node' C, and the
   multicast address M. The identity of the group is carried in join
   messages and data messages. M no longer has to be unique across the
   Internet. It only has to be unique per C. The other idea, which is
   independent of the first, it to build a bidirectional tree (as is
   done in CBT and BGMP) instead of building per-source trees from each
   sender.  This reduces the state necessary in routers to support
   multicast.


1.0 Introduction

   IP Multicast has been around for over a decade, and several multicast
   protocols have been developed over the years. However, the solutions
   are either difficult to understand or expensive to deploy or both. In

Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   particular, we believe that multicast address allocation protocols
   are too complex and BGMP in combination with MASC will not scale
   easily.

   In this paper, we present a design we call Simple Multicast that
   reduces the complexity and overhead of multicast. It is not really
   "yet another multicast protocol". Instead, it is more like a subset
   of other protocols, with one variation; to have the identifier of a
   group consist of both C (the core) and M (the multicast address).
   This eliminates the need to have unique multicast addresses and
   coordinate multicast addresses across the Internet.

1.1 Previous Work

   DVMRP is the first multicast routing protocol proposed. It uses a
   simple mechanism of flooding and pruning.

   The scalability issues with DVMRP led to the development of CBT. In
   CBT, a multicast group is formed by choosing a distinguished node,
   the "core", and having all members join by sending special join
   messages towards the core. The routers along the path keep state
   about which ports are in the group. If a router along the path of the
   join already has state about that group the join does not proceed
   further. Instead the router just "grafts" the new limb onto the tree.
   The result is a tree of shortest paths from the core, with only the
   routers along the path knowing anything about that group.

   In PIM-SM, each node could independently decide whether the volume of
   traffic from a particular source is worth switching from a shared
   tree to a per-source tree.  Thus, there are two possible trees for
   traffic from a particular source for group M; the shared tree and the
   source tree. To prevent loops, the shared tree had to be
   unidirectional, i.e., to send to the shared tree, the data has to be
   encapsulated and unicast to the core.

   The other issue that makes current protocols complex is the necessity
   for routers to be able to figure out the location of the core based
   solely on the multicast address M.  In PIM-SM, this resulted in a
   protocol whereby "core-capable" routers are being continuously
   advertised. All routers keep track of the current set of live core-
   capable routers, and there is a hashing function to map a multicast
   address to one of the set of core-capable routers. This advertisement
   protocol is confined to within a domain because it was recognized
   that this mechanism would not scale to the entire Internet.

   For inter-domain multicast, a set of new protocols has been proposed.
   The MASC protocol deals with hierarchical block allocation of Class D
   address space.  Essentially, it creates a prefix structure in

Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   multicast address space in a way similar to unicast address space.
   Because of the limited multicast address space, the allocation has to
   be dynamic.  MASC contains mechanisms for collision detection and
   de-allocation. Once a block of multicast addresses is allocated, and
   no collision is detected for a period of time, the address block is
   then given to MAAS servers for actual assignment to multicast groups.
   The address block has to be propagated through BGP+ so that routers
   throughout the Internet can know the mapping of multicast addresses
   to cores, even in other domains. BGMP then uses this information to
   know the direction in which a join to multicast address M should be
   sent.

1.2 Overview of Simple Multicast

   The Simple Multicast proposal tries to reduce or eliminate some of
   the complexity and overhead of multicast by taking a slightly
   different approach.  The basic idea in Simple Multicast is that a
   multicast group is created by generating:

   - a distinguished node C known as the "core"

   - a multicast address M

   The multicast group is then identified by the pair (C,M) rather than
   just M as in conventional IP multicast. Note that the address M does
   not have to be unique across the Internet now. Instead, only the pair
   (C,M) has to be unique. That means that every node C in the Internet
   can assign the full 28 bits worth of multicast addresses.

   In Simple Multicast, multicast address allocation and core placement
   (i.e., choosing a multicast address M and a core C for a multicast
   group) are taken out of the basic multicast protocol. End systems may
   find out about the multicast address M and the core C for a group
   through one of several possible mechanisms including email
   announcement, web advertising, SDR, DNS lookup etc.  Both SM-aware
   endnodes and SM-aware routers must recognize the combination of (C,M)
   as the identity of the group.

   Once the end systems have M and C, they then join the group by
   sending a special join message towards the core C, creating state in
   the routers along the path until the join packet hits the core or a
   router that is already on the tree for this multicast group. This
   creates a branch in the bi-directional distribution tree for the
   group. The current IGMP mechanism for joining groups is fine,
   provided that both C and M appear in the IGMP reply. Until IGMP is
   modified to support this, the join message itself can be sent from
   the end system. If both C and M appear in the join message, then the
   first hop router can initiate the join.

Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   To enable incremental deployment of Simple Multicast, we provide a
   mechanism for 'tunnels' to be established between SM routers. A
   'tunnel' port is created when the join message traverses non-SM aware
   routers. (See Joining a Group).

   The multicast tree formed is bidirectional, meaning that traffic can
   be injected from any point. The core is just another node in the
   tree.  The data packet contains both C and M, and routers look up the
   group based on the combination (C,M).

   Data packets would need to carry both C and M. There has been a few
   suggestions on how this may be done:  1) Define a new IP option and
   specify both C and M in it.  2) Define a new protocol and specify the
   new protocol in the 'protocol' field of the IPv4 header. Encapsulate
   the payload inside this new protocol. This new protocol header will
   contain both C and M.

   Since all the fields required for the first approach are the exact
   same fields required for the second approach, we have arbitrarily
   chosen to describe data packets based on the new IP option. In the
   next revision of this draft, the approach deemed most suitable will
   be used instead.

   The new IP option will carry both C and M. The reason for carrying
   both C and M in the option instead of carrying at least one of them
   in the destination address is to allow SM aware routers to co-exist
   with non-SM aware routers. The destination address in the IP packet
   is set to a reserved multicast address, the ALL-SM-NODES, when
   sending to networks with SM aware routers.  This ensures that non SM
   routers will not forward SM multicast data packets. When the packet
   must hop over non-SM routers, the IP destination address is set to
   the next SM-aware router in the path.

   A nice feature of Simple Multicast is that, since both C and M are in
   the IP option, the destination address in the IP packet can be
   replaced with the tunnel endpoint address, and packets can be
   'tunneled' with very little work. Instead of having to add and delete
   IP headers (if the packet is encapsulated IPIP), the only work is to
   write the tunnel endpoint address into the destination address of the
   IP header..

1.3 Why Simple Multicast

   We now discuss some of the advantages of Simple Multicast.

   - One protocol is all that is needed.  Currently, we need to deal
   with two sets of multicast protocols in order to support multicast in
   the Internet: DVMRP, PIM-DM, PIM-SM and CBT etc for intra-domain



Expires May 1999                                                [Page 4]





Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   multicast and MASC, MAAS and BGMP for inter-domain support. The
   beauty of the Simple Multicast proposal is only one multicast
   protocol is needed for both intra-domain and inter-domain.  This is
   possible because Simple Multicast is designed to be scalable.

   - Scalability.  Simple Multicast is scalable to the global Internet.
   This scalability is achieved by using a trivial multicast address
   allocation scheme, decoupling core selection and discovery from the
   multicast protocol and using bi-directional trees.  If core discovery
   is decoupled from multicast routing protocols such as PIM-SM or CBT,
   these protocols would not have to use the bootstrap mechanism to
   discover and select cores, a mechanism generally considered to be not
   scalable.

   - Trivial multicast address allocation. IP Multicast address
   allocation is still an unresolved problem. Dynamically allocating
   addresses such that addresses are allocated in aggregatable blocks,
   while ensuring low probability of address collision (non-uniqueness)
   is non-trivial. In Simple Multicast, since (C,M) is the identifier
   for a multicast group, address assignment becomes totally trivial,
   since addresses only have to be unique per core. Each core can have
   the full 28 bit space (over 200 million address) so we have virtually
   unlimited multicast addresses. Each core can allocate these addresses
   independently without Internet-wide coordination.

   - Cost effective and efficient delivery trees.  It takes less state
   in routers to support a group with n senders with a single shared
   tree than with n per-sender trees. A bidirectional shared tree is as
   cost effective for delivery of traffic from source S,even if S is not
   the core, as a per-source tree rooted at S. The bidirectional shared
   tree is much more efficient for delivery of traffic from non-core
   source S than a unidirectional tree where the data from S must be
   tunneled to the core before being multicast.

   Bidirectional trees are more robust. In a unidirectional tree, the
   core is needed for relaying packets from all senders. If the core is
   down, the tree is gone. For a bi-directional tree, the core does not
   hold any particular significance. The core is just another node in
   the tree. If the core is down, the tree is merely partitioned and may
   still be used for traffic delivery if the application chooses to do
   so.

   - Incremental deployment.  Simple Multicast routers may be deployed
   along side unicast routers and other multicast routers. Traffic is
   effectively tunneled (although the actual mechanism used is more
   efficient than tunnels) through routers which do not support Simple
   Multicast. Therefore a network manager may incrementally add Simple
   Multicast routers as multicast users spread in the network.

2.0 The Design

   In this section, we describe the design of Simple Multicast and its
   basic operations in detail.

2.1 Creating a Multicast Group

   To create a group, one needs to select a core address and a multicast
   address.

   Typically most applications consist of a single high-volume source.
   For those applications, the core should be the source. For others,
   any node close to any member of the group would be a logical choice
   for core. Because the tree-building strategy (like BGMP) uses a
   single exit point from a domain or any region separated from the rest
   of the Internet through expensive links, the traffic pattern
   resembles individual trees within domains hooked together with
   inter-domain paths. In other words, if S is in your domain, then you
   will receive traffic from S through a path internal to your domain
   even if the core of the group is outside the domain. Therefore, even
   if most of the members of the group are in Europe, and one member of
   the group is in Australia, and the Australian is chosen as the core,
   the tree will still be a very good tree. Traffic between the
   Europeans would be multicast through the tree confined  within
   Europe, even though the core was in Australia.

   As the multicast addresses only need to be unique per core, each core
   has over 200 million multicast addresses for allocation. Once the
   core is chosen, some very simple mechanisms can be used to generate
   the multicast address for the chosen core, for example, querying the
   core for an address or random  generation as it is done in SDR (the
   collision rate will be significantly lower). Some permanent mapping
   of "well-known" addresses for popular groups is also feasible.

2.2 Joining a Group

   To join a group, one first has to find the core address C and
   multicast address M. It is appropriate to have a variety of
   mechanisms. A web page advertising a "singles chat group" might
   advertise its (C,M) on its web page. Or a provider of some other sort
   of service, like stock quotes, might advertise on a web page.
   Ideally, clicking on the web page would cause M and C to be
   downloaded to the client machine, which would then join the group.
   Another mechanism, for instance when arranging a private conference,
   might be to be told about M and C via the telephone, or via email.
   Yet another mechanism is to have the group (together with a name or a
   description) advertised in a directory such as SDR.

Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   Once the client node knows it wants to join the group (C,M), it sends
   a join message, containing C and M. This  message is sent towards the
   core, creating state in the routers along the path, so that each
   router knows which ports are in the group (C,M). If a router receives
   a join for multicast address (C,M), and it already has state for
   (C,M), then it merely adds that port to its set of ports for (C,M)
   and does not forward the join further.  The result is a tree of
   shortest paths from the core to each member.  Each router on the tree
   has a database of (C,M, {ports}) that tells it, for group (C,M), the
   ports that data should be forwarded to.

   The join message is sent with the Router Alert option. Since the join
   message has C as the destination address, if an intermediate router
   is not SM aware, it will just forward the join towards the core. When
   the join message reaches an SM-aware router R2, it looks at the IP
   source address of the join message, say R1. If R1 is a neighbor, R2
   adds the port from which the join was received to its list of ports
   for (C,M). If R1 is not a neighbor, R2 will add a join-ack to R1. If
   R2 is not a neighbor, R1 adds the 'tunnel port' to R2 as its 'parent
   port' for (C,M). If R2 is a neighbor, R1 just adds the port as its
   parent port for (C,M), since the packet will not need to be tunneled
   to get to R2.

2.3 Transmitting to multicast group (C,M)

   A sender who is a member of the group, sends an IP packet with C and
   M in the new IP option field. The destination IP address is set to
   ALL-SM-NODES. This ensures non SM aware nodes will ignore the packet.
   Only SM aware routers will forward the packet.

   A router that receives an SM packet looks up (C,M) in its forwarding
   table. If it knows about (C,M), it checks if the port it received the
   packet on is in its database. If not, it drops the packet. If so, it
   forwards the packet onto all the other ports listed in its database
   for (C,M). If the outgoing port is a tunnel port, the destination
   address of the IP header is replaced by the tunnel endpoint, and will
   therefore travel across routers that are not SM-aware. At the other
   end of the tunnel, the SM-aware router will replace the destination
   address with ALL-SM-NODES, or with another tunnel endpoint's address,
   depending on whether the packet is being forwarded on a "real port"
   or a "tunnel port.

   If you are not a member of the group but want to transmit to the
   group, you place C into the IP destination address, and put C and M
   in the IP option. The packet might travel all the way to the core,
   but if it instead hits an SM-aware router R with state about (C,M)
   before it gets to the core, R will inject the packet into the tree.

2.4 Inter-domain Multicast

   Simple Multicast works both for intra-domain and inter-domain
   multicast. Because the join message of Simple Multicast carries the
   core IP address, and unicast routing already knows how to reach any
   IP address, the join message will be delivered based on the unicast
   forwarding table.

   Where the unicast and multicast topologies are incongruent, BGP-4+
   [MBGP] allows a network provider to specify the path it would accept
   multicast traffic independent of the path unicast traffic would
   traverse. In the figure below, AS1 may have a peering agreement with
   AS2 to forward its unicast traffic, but a peering agreement with AS3
   to forward multicast traffic. A join from AS1 towards any cores in
   AS4 would be sent via AS3. A finer granularity of policy may specify
   certain network or core ranges that AS3 would carry traffic for.

           AS2
         *     *
        *       *
      AS1       AS4
        *       *
         *     *
           AS3

   The join message to C should be routed towards the exit router
   specified by BGP4+, for delivery of multicast traffic outside of the
   domain.

2.5 Failure Recovery

   The situations to detect are:

   - branch unused

   - loop

   - path to core broken or changed

   - core dead or unreachable

   Any of the tree-building schemes (CBT, PIM-SM, BGMP) need to solve
   these problems, and there is no need to do anything radically new.
   The only extra mechanism we've introduced is for loop detection.
   Since packets can quickly proliferate in a multicast loop, it is
   desirable to detect a loop as soon as it is formed forms.  Since SM
   uses an IP option, we can make use of a flag that will enable us to
   detect a loop on a data packet.

Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   The other mechanisms we specify are similar to those already in place
   for PIM, CBT, and BGMP.

2.5.1 Unused Branch

   A branch must be kept alive with a "keep-alive" message. If R
   receives at least one keep-alive message from a child in tree (C,M),
   R sends a keep-alive to its parent port for (C,M). If no keep-alive
   is received for some amount of time (at least a few keep-alive
   intervals) from some child port for (C,M), that port is removed from
   the list of ports. If there are no more child ports, then R stops
   sending keep-alives, or as an optimization "unjoins" from its parent.

2.5.2 Loop

   It would be easy to detect a loop if we could assume that any data
   packet for which TTL became zero implied there was a loop.
   Unfortunately, some applications do an "expanding ring search" or a
   traceroute in which packets are launched with very small TTLs. It
   would be wrong to conclude there was a loop when the TTL on those
   packets expired.

   We use a flag in the IP option to indicate a packet that would
   indicate a loop if its TTL reached 0. An application launching a
   packet with a low TTL would not set that flag. SM routers do not need
   to look at the flag except on packets for which TTL expires.

   Loops can also be detected on keep-alive and heartbeat messages
   (which are sent outwards from the core...see next section). The
   keep-alive message indicates "hops from furthest leaf". A router
   collects keep-alives from its child ports and transmits a keep-alive
   that is one hop more than the maximum "hops" it receives in any keep
   alive from a child.

   The heartbeat is like a keep-alive, but from the parent. Likewise it
   carries a "distance from the core". In either case (heartbeat or
   keep-alive) if the distance gets too great a loop is suspected and
   the port is removed from the tree and the child rejoins to the core.

2.5.3 Path to core broken or changed

   A parent transmits a "heartbeat" message to its children at regular
   intervals. The heartbeat indicates whether the core is known to be
   alive. A parent continues sending heartbeat messages even if it stops
   receiving "core-alive" heartbeats from its parent. In this way a
   subtree will continue functioning even if the core is dead.  And if
   the core is not dead, the parent can simply rejoin without causing
   disruption to the nodes below it in the tree.



Expires May 1999                                                [Page 9]





Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   If unicast routing indicates the path to the core has changed, R
   rejoins to the core, again, without disrupting the subtree below it.

   Since the heartbeat message is generated at regular intervals even if
   a heartbeat is not received from the parent, a very long tree does
   not suffer from delay variance that might cause nodes very far from
   the core to incorrectly assume the tree was broken.

2.5.4 Core dead or unreachable

   When the core transmits a heartbeat message it sets the "core alive"
   flag. If a router has received a heartbeat message from its parent
   with the "core alive" flag set recently enough (3 heartbeat
   intervals), then it sets the "core alive" flag in its heartbeat
   messages to its children.

   If it stops receiving heartbeats with "core alive", it attempts to
   rejoin to the core. If it succeeds, it prunes itself from the old
   parent and rejoins to the core.

   The only purpose of knowing whether the core is alive or not is for
   applications to decide, if there are multiple trees for a group,
   which tree they should transmit on. (see next section)

2.5.5 Multiple Trees for Reliability

   The core should be selected to be a node that is reliable. However,
   if a group will be long-lived and there is the worry that the core
   might die, a simple mechanism is to create multiple trees (C1, M1)
   and (C2, M2) for this group. All members join both groups. They can
   transmit on either group. If "core alive" heartbeat is only received
   on group (C1, M1) that is the group that should be transmitted to.

   For applications for which instantaneous switchover is more important
   than overhead, senders should transmit on both trees.

2.6 Access Control

   We accomplish access control by allowing the core for the group to be
   configured with the set of allowed senders. The core can put the
   access rules into the heartbeat message. The heartbeat message
   contains a list of address prefixes of authorized senders and
   unauthorized senders. If the rules do not fit into the heartbeat, or
   the core for privacy reasons does not want to advertise in advance
   all the allowed senders, it can specify that no senders other than It
   is allowed. In that case, all senders must tunnel packets to the core
   and the core will forward them. Once a sender gets permission to
   send, and is known to have data to send, the core can add that

   sender's address to the heartbeat message.

   For example, if there is some sort of authentication that must be
   done in order to get permission, the core initially disallows all
   senders, but then when S1 gets permission, it gets added to the list
   in the heartbeat message.

   Since the heartbeat message gives the access rules, all SM routers
   will refuse to forward a packet from a sender disallowed by the
   access rules.

   Border/Access routers may also have an additional Access Control List
   locally.  For instance, it may have a list of sender
   prefixes/addresses allowed to transmit multicast data.  All multicast
   traffic with source address matching these prefixes/ addresses will
   not be filtered. The Include/Exclude Senders List from the core will
   prevent these senders from sending to a group that they are not
   permitted to.

2.7 Dynamically forming more trees

   In some cases dynamically formed auxiliary trees make sense,
   especially in the interdomain, where policy might prohibit packets
   from A to D to transit domain B. With a core in domain B, or just due
   to the shared tree that happened to get formed, packets from senders
   in A to receivers in D might traverse domain B. One simple method of
   solving the problem is to have A unicast to the core, and have the
   core send the multicast. B is still acting as a transit domain
   between A and D, but it doesn't know it.

   Another solution takes inspiration from the PIM-SM concept of using
   the shared tree to find out about per-source trees. The way it works
   is that the sender in domain A, say X, sends a message to the core C
   telling it that it would like to create a "spin-off" group, (X,M').
   Then the core C, in the heartbeat messages for group (C,M) advertises
   the spin-off trees that members of (C,M) should also join. The spin-
   off tree would, like the original tree, be kept robust through keep-
   alives.

   Although this does allow creation of multiple trees to support a
   single group, this is less expensive than the PIM-SM scheme because
   it does not always create a tree for every sender. It only does it
   when necessary, and does not need a totally separate tree for each
   sender. It only needs one per domain in which there are sources (and
   only when the shared tree doesn't work because of transit policy
   problems).

2.8 Additional Features

Internet Draft              Simple Multicast               November 1998


   We are investigating the following additional features, which are not
   available in other multicast protocols:

   - the ability to select dense-mode. Currently there are routers that
   implement dense mode and routers that implement sparse mode, and
   typically a domain will implement either sparse or dense mode. There
   is no way to choose, per application, which type of tree is more
   appropriate.

   There are cases in which dense mode makes more sense for an
   application.  For example, dense mode is more appropriate if the
   number of receivers is so dense that there is very little
   optimization gained by creating a tree. Dense mode is also
   appropriate when the volume of data is sufficiently low that
   optimizing its delivery is not worth the overhead of creating and
   maintaining a tree.

   With SM we use the convention of core=FF:FF:FF:FF to indicate the
   packet should be sent via dense-mode. For such packets no tree is
   formed and routers merely forward the packet using reverse path
   forwarding.

   Routers find out whether their neighbors support SM, and other
   characteristics of their neighbors, through Hello messages. A dense
   mode SM-packet should only be sent to SM-aware neighbors. As with
   DVMRP, tunnels can be configured between SM-aware nodes to enable a
   wider range for delivery of dense-mode SM packets.

   - the ability to join a set of groups. The join message contains (C,
   M, mask). That facilitates having content parameterized by M. For
   instance, if the set of groups (C,*) is for stock information,
   certain bits in M can encode industry, country, etc. To receive
   information about all stocks, join (C,*). To receive some subset,
   join a more specific (M, mask) for core C.

3.0 Packet formats

   This section describes all the packet formats. Simple Multicast could
   be implemented as very small modifications to PIM, CBT, or BGMP.

   The packet types are:

   - data packet

   - join-request

   - join-ack

   - keep-alive (sent by child to parent)

   - heartbeat (sent by parent to child)

   - flush-tree (sent by parent to child after a loop is detected, to
   clear out state from looped tree as quickly as possible and cause
   subtree to be reformed)

   For all control packets (JOIN-REQUEST, JOIN-ACK, KEEP-ALIVE,
   HEARTBEAT, FLUSH-TREE), the "Protocol" field in the IPv4 header is
   set to SM (a new protocol field).

3.1 SM-'tunnels'

   Upstream (towards the core) or downstream SM routers may not be
   immediate neighbors, if there are non-SM routers on the path between
   them.  In a traditional tunnel between R1 and R2, R1 must add an
   extra IP header, and R2 must delete the header. SM gets the same
   functionality without adding and deleting headers. Instead all that
   is needed is to overwrite the destination address in the IP header to
   the address of the "tunnel" endpoint. The reason this can be done is
   that the information necessary for SM-routers to route the packet
   (namely C and M) are contained in the IP option.

   JOIN-REQUESTs and JOIN-ACKs allow tunnel-endpoints to learn of each
   other.  The state for a "tunnel" consists of the IP address of the
   endpoint, and the number of actual IP hops in the tunnel. The purpose
   of keeping the count of the tunnel's hops is because SM counts the
   length of the tree, so that senders can know what to set as the TTL
   in data packets.

   - when a non-member sender transmits the packet, the destination is
   set to the core address. The purpose of this is to enable the packet
   to be unicast until it hits a node that is SM-aware, at which point
   the packet is multicast along the tree from the point at which it
   entered the tree.

   - when the packet is transmitted on a tunnel port, in which case the
   destination address is set to the IP address of the tunnel endpoint.

   Note that at Layer 2, the MAC address is mapped to the Multicast
   Address M of the group (C,M), not to ALL-SM-NODES.

   The heartbeat is sent by a parent to a child. It is sent periodically
   regardless of whether heartbeat is received from its parent.  The
   destination IP address is set to ALL-SM-NODES or the tunnel endpoint
   address.

   The HEARTBEAT may contain the following additional options:  -
   Include/Exclude Senders List. This is the list of allowed/prohibited
   senders to the group. The format of this option is the same the
   KEEP-ALIVE Include/Exclude Senders List, although it serves as a
   different purpose here.

   - spin-off groups (Ci,Mi). One or more spin-off groups (Ci,Mi) may be
   specified.

   - HEARTBEAT Option. This option should appear the same number of
   times as the address set (C,M,mask). It corresponds and is applicable
   to the address set (C,M,mask).

   The fields in this option are:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   - distance from core. Number of hops to core (C,M,mask), core
   distance. The core distance is incremented at every SM hop. In
   addition, when the KEEP-ALIVE is received from a tunnel port, core
   distance = core distance + number of hops in 'tunnel' - Time left
   before group should be closed down. (all 'ones' indicates group
   should not be torn down) - The 'A' bit if set indicates the core is
   alive or reachable


   - 'Originating TTL'. This is as described in JOIN-ACK.

   The destination IP address is set to ALL-SM-NODES or the tunnel
   endpoint address. FLUSH-TREE is sent with the Router Alert Option.

   The Multicast address and corresponding mask (M,m) may appear
   multiple times. The total length of these fields is specified in the
   "addr_len" field of the common control header.

   No options are currently defined.
