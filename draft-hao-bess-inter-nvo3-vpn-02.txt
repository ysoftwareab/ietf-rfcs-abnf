1. Introduction

   In cloud computing era, multi-tenancy has become a core requirement
   for data centers. Since NVO3 can satisfy multi-tenancy key
   requirements, this technology is being deployed in an increasing
   number of cloud data center network. NVO3 focuses on the
   construction of overlay networks that operate over an IP (L3)
   underlay transport network. It can provide layer 2 bridging and
   layer 3 IP service for each tenant. VXLAN and NVGRE are two typical
   NVO3 technologies. NVO3 overlay network can be controlled through
   centralized NVE-NVA architecture or through distributed BGP VPN
   protocol.

   NVO3 has good scaling properties from relatively small networks to
   networks with several million tenant systems (TSs) and hundreds of
   thousands of virtual networks within a single administrative domain.
   In NVO3 network, 24-bit VNID is used to identify different virtual
   networks, theoretically 16M virtual networks can be supported in a
   data center. In a data center network, each tenant may include one
   or more layer 2 virtual network and in normal cases each tenant
   corresponds to one routing domain (RD). Normally each layer 2
   virtual network corresponds to one or more subnets.

   To provide cloud service to external data center client, data center
   networks should be connected with WAN networks. BGP MPLS/IP VPN has
   already been widely deployed at WAN networks. Normally internal data
   center and external MPLS/IP VPN network belongs to different
   autonomous system(AS). This requires the setting up of inter-as
   connections at Autonomous System Border Routers(ASBRs) between NVO3
   network and external MPLS/IP network.

   Currently, a typical connection mechanism between a data center
   network and an MPLS/IP VPN network is similar to Inter-AS Option-A
   of RFC4364, but it has scalability issue if there is huge number of
   tenants in data center networks. To overcome the issue, inter-as
   Option-B between NVO3 network and BGP MPLS/IP VPN network is
   proposed in this draft.

   There are two tenants in NVO3 network, TSs in tenant 1 can freely
   communicate with CEs in VPN-Red, TSs in tenant 2 can freely
   communicate with CEs in VPN-Green. TS1 and TS3 belong to tenant 1,
   TS2 and TS4 belong to tenant 2. CE1 belongs to VPN-Red, CE2 belongs
   to VPN-Green. VNID 10 and VNID 20 are used to identify tenant 1 and
   tenant 2 respectively. CE1 and CE2 have local IP prefix of
   10.1.1.1/24 and 20.1.1.1/24 respectively.

4. Option-A inter-as solution overview

   In Option-A inter-as solution, peering ASBRs are connected by
   multiple sub-interfaces, each ASBR acts as a PE, and thinks that the
   other ASBR is a CE. Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)data bases
   (RIB/FIB) are configured at AS border routers (ASBR-d and ASBR-w) so
   that each ASBRs associate each such sub-interface with a VRF and use
   EBGP to distribute unlabeled IPv4 addresses to each other. In the
   data-plane, VLANs are used for tenant traffic separation. ASBR-d
   terminates NVO3 encapsulation for inter-subnet traffic from TS in
   internal DC to CE in external DC.

   Option-A inter-as solution has following issues:

   1. Up to 16 million (16M) gateway interfaces (virtual/physical) and
      16M EBGP session need to exist between the ASBRs.

   2. UP to 16M VRFs need to be supported on border routers.

   3. Several million routing entries need to be supported on border
      routers.

   Inter-as option-B between NVO3 network and MPLS IP/VPN network can
   be used to address these issues. As option-B proposed in this draft
   is for multi-as interconnection between heterogeneous networks, so
   there are some differences from traditional Inter-AS Option-B of
   RFC4364.

5. Vanilla Option-B inter-as solution overview

   Similar to the solution described in section 10, part (b) of
   [RFC4364] (commonly referred to as Option-B) peering ASBRs are
   connected as private peers that are enabled to receive Labeled
   packets from trusted peers. An MP-BGP session is used to distribute
   the labeled VPN prefixes between the ASBRs. In data plane, the
   traffic that flows between the ASBRs is placed in MPLS tunnels.
   Traffic separation among different VPNs between the ASBRs relies on
   MPLS VPN Label. The advantage of this option is that it's more

Internet-Draft            Inter-As Option-B                   May 2015


   scalable, as there is no need to have separate interface and BGP
   session per VPN/Tenant.

   As for the routing distribution process from DC to WAN side, MPLS
   VPN Label is allocated on ASBR-d per VN per NVE. As for the routing
   distribution process from WAN to DC side, VNID is allocated on ASBR-
   d per MPLS VPN Label receiving from per ASBR-w. As for the data
   plane process, NVO3 tunnel and MPLS VPN tunnel are stitched at ASBR-
   d. From DC to WAN side, NVO3 tunnel is terminated, VNID and MPLS VPN
   Label switching is performed by looking up outgoing forwarding table
   in section 6.1.2. From WAN to DC side, MPLS VPN tunnel is terminated,
   MPLS VPN Label and NVO3 tunnel switching is performed by looking up
   incoming forwarding table in section 6.1.1. ASBR-w has no difference
   with traditional RFC4364 based Option-B behavior, no VRF is created
   on the ASBR-d.

6. Vanilla Inter-As Option-B procedures

   Each NVE operates as a layer 3 gateway for local connecting TS(s).
   Operators may configure single and unique VNID for each tenant
   network on all NVEs or configure NVEs to locally allocate VNID for
   each tenant on the NVEs, the VNID is called VNID-t.

   Routing information for each tenant should be synchronized between
   NVO3 and MPLS VPN network. In internal DC NVO3 network, routing
   information synchronization between NVE and ASBR-d can be through
   either: a) BGP MPLS/IP VPN protocol running between the NVEs and the
   ASBR-d or b) NVE-NVA architecture.

   In case a), it is a coupled solution, the NVE entity normally
   resides on hardware network device like TOR switch. VRFs can be
   created on each NVE to isolate IP routing information in control
   plane and IP forwarding process in data plane between different
   tenants, each VRF has its own IP routing table. The BGP routes are
   originated on NVE with either implied nexthop address of the BGP
   router or self-nexthop set.

   In case b), it is a decoupled solution, the NVE entity normally
   resides on vSwitch. VRFs are created on NVA only for control plane
   information isolation between different tenants, while in data plane,
   unified flow tables are used for all tenants on each NVE.

6.1. Using BGP MPLS/IP VPN protocol

   Each NVE is a BGP speaker. Operators configure VRF and RD/RT for
   each tenant network on each NVE. BGP MPLS/IP VPN protocol extension
   is running between NVEs and ASBR-d utilizing the [BGP Remote-Next-

   Hop] attribute which specifies a set of remote tunnels (1 to N) that
   occur between two BGP speakers.

   When an NVE advertises a prefix with RD/RT, tunnel encapsulation and
   VNID-t are carried in BGP update message [BGP Remote-Next-Hop]. The
   NVE BGP receiver imports the prefix according RD/RT and maintains
   the mapping of prefix and VNID plus tunnel encapsulation(For VXLAN
   and NVGRE, they are outer destination IP address and inner
   destination MAC) in VRF.

   [Note: the [BGP Remote-Next-Hop] is a work-in-progress that is an
   individual draft. The IDR WG may modify this draft or adopt another
   that provides a similar mechanism to support remote next-hops.  This
   draft will follow the IDR adoption of a remote next-hop solution.]

6.1.1. DC to WAN direction

   1. NVE1 and NVE2 operate as a layer 3 gateway for local connecting
      TSs. They learn the local TS's IP Address via ARP or other mode
      and then advertise local TS's IP Address with local NVE's NVO3
      tunnel end points information to ASBR-d using [BGP Remote-Next-
      Hop]. The routing information from NVE1 and NVE2 are as follows.

                  +---------+------------+-------+---------+--------+
                  |  Node   | IP Prefix  |  RD   |  RT     | VNID-t |
                  |  NVE1   |   TS1/32   | RD-A  | RT-A    |   10   |
                  |  NVE1   |   TS2/32   | RD-B  | RT-B    |   20   |
                  |  NVE2   |   TS3/32   | RD-A  | RT-A    |   10   |
                  |  NVE2   |   TS4/32   | RD-B  | RT-B    |   20   |
                  +---------+------------+-------+---------+--------+

                        Table 1 Routing information from NVE


   2. When ASBR-d receives routing information from each NVE, it
      allocates MPLS VPN Label per tenant (VNID-t) per NVE and the RD
      and RT remain the same (see table 2 below for examples). Then the
      ASBR-d advertises the VPN route with new allocated MPLS VPN Label
      to ASBR-w. The allocated MPLS VPN label and its corresponding
      <NVE, VNID-t> pair forms incoming forwarding table which is used
      to forward MPLS traffic from WAN to DC side. As an example the
      incoming forwarding table on ASBR-d could be as follows:

                            Table 2 Incoming forwarding table


6.1.2. WAN to DC direction

   1. When ASBR-d receives routing information from ASBR-w, ASBR-d
      allocates VNID-d for each VPN Label, and then ASBR-w advertises
      the VPN route with new allocated VNID-d to each NVE (NVE1 and
      NVE2). The role of the VNID-d is similar to the role of Incoming
      VPN Label in traditional MPLS VPN Option-B based ASBR defined in
      [RFC 4364], it has local significance on ASBR-d, each VNID
      corresponds to a MPLS VPN Label received from peer ASBR-w. The
      allocated VNID-d and its corresponding out VPN Label forms an
      outgoing forwarding table which is used to forward NVO3 traffic
      from DC to WAN side. Assuming ASBR-d receives VPN Label 3000 and
      4000 from ASBR-w allocated for VPN-Red and VPN-Green at PE1
      respectively, the outgoing forwarding table on ASBR-d is as
      follows:

   2. When each local NVE receives routing information from ASBR-d, it
      matches the Route Target Attribute in BGP MPLS/IP VPN protocol
      with local VRF's import RT configuration and populates local VRF
      with these matched VPN routes (see table 3 above).

6.2.  Data plane procedures

   This section describes the step by step procedures of data forward
   between TS1 and CE1 for either: a) DC to WAN direction IP data flows,
   or b) WAN to DC direction IP data flows.

6.2.1. DC to WAN direction

   1. TS1 sends traffic to NVE1, the destination IP is CE1's IP address.

   2. NVE1 looks up tenant 1's IP forwarding table, then it gets NVO3
      tunnel encapsulation information. The destination outer address
      is ASBR-d's IP address, VNID is 10000 allocated by ASBR-d for VPN
      route of CE1 received from ASBR-w. NVE1 performs NVO3
      encapsulation and sends the traffic to ASBR-d.

   3. ASBR-d decapsulates NVO3 encapsulation and gets VNID 10000. Then
      it looks up outgoing forwarding table based on the VNID and gets
      MPLS VPN label 3000. Finally it pushes MPLS VPN label for the IP
      traffic and sends it to ASBR-w.

   4. Then the traffic is forwarded to CE1 through regular MPLS VPN
      forwarding process.

Internet-Draft            Inter-As Option-B                   May 2015


6.2.2. WAN to DC direction

   1. CE1 sends traffic to PE1, destination IP is TS1's IP address. The
      traffic is forwarded to ASBR-d through regular MPLS VPN
      forwarding process. The incoming MPLS VPN label at ASBR-d is 1000
      allocated by ASBR-d for tenant 1 at NVE1.

   2. ASBR-d looks up incoming forwarding table and gets NVO3
      encapsulation, then performs NVO3 encapsulation and sends the
      traffic to NVE1. The destination outer IP is NVE1's IP, VNID is
      10 corresponding to tenant 1.

   3. NVE1 decapsulates NVO3 encapsulation, gets local IP forwarding
      table relying on VNID 10, and then sends the traffic to TS1.



6.2.3. Data plane NVE Operations summary

   Each NVE maintains a lookup table per tenant, i.e. VNID-t and the
   received mappings from ASBR-d for each tenant. For the prefix that
   is from inside DC, the inner/outer mapping entry is the prefix <->
   remote NVE IP address. For the prefix that is from outside DC, the
   inner/outer mapping entry is the prefix <-> VNID-d + ASBR1-d IP
   address.

   When receiving a packet from a tenant system locally, NVE performs a
   lookup in the corresponding tenant table for the destination address
   on the packet. If the prefix results to single IP address, NVE will
   encapsulate the packet with VNID-t and IP address as outer IP
   address. If the prefix results to a VNID and IP address, NVE will
   encapsulate the packet with the VNID and IP address as outer IP
   address.

   When receiving a packet from NVO3, NVE decapsulates the packet and
   find the attached tenant system based on the VNID and destination
   address on the packet, forward the decapsulated packet to the tenant
   system.



6.3. NVE-NVA architecture

   In this architecture, the NVE control plane and forwarding
   functionality are decoupled. All NVEs in NVO3 network don't need
   support distributed BGP VPN protocol [BGP Remote-Next-Hop], these
   NVEs have only data plane functionality and are controlled by

   centralized NVA using openflow, ovsdb, i2rs, etc. The NVA runs IBGP
   VPN protocol for all the NVEs with ASBR-d utilizing the [BGP Remote-
   Next-Hop] attribute to pass along the tunnel endpoints and
   encapsulations associated with each NVE. The ASBR-d runs EBGP VPN
   protocol with peer ASBR-w. ASBR-d allocates MPLS VPN Label per
   tenant per NVE.

   NVA maintains all tenant information, and originates BGP routes with
   the appropriate RD and AD.  The NVA tenant information includes
   VNID-t to identify each tenant and the corresponding RD and RT. This
   information can be statically configured by operators or dynamically
   notified by cloud management systems. This information also includes
   all TS's MAC/IP address and its attached NVE information.

6.3.1. DC to WAN direction

   1. NVA advertises all internal data center VPN routing information
      to ASBR-d, which includes RD, RT, VNID-t, IP prefix and the
      attached NVE IP address. The VNID-t and NVE IP address are used
      for traffic NVO3 encapsulation from ASBR-d to NVE.

   2. ASBR-d allocates MPLS VPN Label per VNID per NVE and generates
      incoming forwarding table same as Table 2.

Internet-Draft            Inter-As Option-B                   May 2015


6.3.2. WAN to DC direction

   1. ASBR-d receives VPN routing information from peer ASBR-w. ASBR-d
      allocates VNID-d, for each MPLS VPN Label receiving from ASBR-w
      and generates outgoing forwarding table same as Table 4. Then it
      advertises the VPN route to NVA, which includes RD, RT, VNID-l,
      IP prefix, and set itself as next hop. The VNID and ASBR-d IP
      address are used for traffic NVO3 encapsulation from NVE to ASBR-
      d.

   2. NVA matches local Route Target configuration, imports VPN route
      to each tenant, and downloads flow table to corresponding NVE.



7. Partial Option-B solution

   In vanilla option-B solution, each NVE need to maintain routing
   items corresponding to IP prefix located outside data center for
   north-south bound traffic forwarding. If there are some VPNs which
   have large number of IP prefix, it will cause much pressure on local
   NVEs. In this case, partial Option-B solution can be used.

   In partial Option-B solution, default route is used for north-south
   bound traffic on each NVE. The traffic from each NVE will be
   forwarded to ASBR-d using NVO3 encapsulation, VNID is used to
   identify tenant VRF at ASBR-d. ASBR-d terminates the NVO3
   encapsulation, looks up local VRF's IP routing table, then performs
   MPLS encapsulation and sends to peer ASBR-w.

   For the traffic from WAN to DC, ASBR-d needs to maintain all TS's IP
   addresses and their attached NVE device in corresponding VRF. When
   the ASBR-d receives MPLS traffic from peer ASBR-w, MPLS
   encapsulation is terminated, looks up local VRF's IP routing table,
   then performs NVO3 encapsulation and sends to local destination NVE.

   From control plane perspective, EBGP VPN connection is terminated at
   ASBR-d, which means the ASBR doesn't allocate new VNID-d for each
   MPLS VPN Label and advertise it to peer NVE in local AS, VRF is
   created on the ASBR-d, the VPN route from WAN side populates to
   local VRF.

8. Inter-as option comparisons

   The document describes several inter-as implementation options
   between ASBR-d and ASBR-w. The following table illustrates the
   comparison among the implementation options.

   +----------------+-----------+------------------+----------------+
         Table 5 Inter-as option comparisons

   Option-A design uses a regular VPN handoff between ASBR-d and ASBR-w.
   A sub-interface is required per a NVO instance in between. Both
   border routers perform the VRF lookup. Thus, the solution has a
   scalability concern. Existing hardware supports this solution.

   Partial Option-B does not require sub-interfaces between ASBR-d and
   ASBR-w, only ASBR-d performs the VRF lookup, so it has better
   scalability than option A. Existing hardware can support this
   solution.

   In the vanilla Option-B solution, there is no sub-interface between
   border routers and no VRF table on ASBR-d and ASBR-w. Tunnel
   stitching is performed on the ASBR-d. Thus this solution has the
   best scalability. From hardware perspective, the vanilla option-B
   needs ASBR-d hardware upgrade to support the tunnel stitching.


9. Security Considerations

   Similar to the security considerations for inter-as Option-B in
   [RFC4364] the appropriate trust relationship must exist between NVO3
   network and MPLS/IP VPN network. VPN-IPv4 routes in NVO3 network
   should neither be distributed to nor accepted from the public
   Internet, or from any BGP peers that are not trusted. For other
   general VPN Security Considerations, see [RFC4364].

10. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions. RFC Editor: Please remove
   this section before publication.
