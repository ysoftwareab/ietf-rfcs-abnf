Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL", when used in the guidelines in this memo, are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
[RFC2580].

2  Overview
This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
(MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based
Internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing devices and
interfaces that conform to the Ethernet Passive Optical Networks
(EPON) standards as defined in [802.3ah]. The document contains a list
of management entities based on the registers defined in the [802.3ah]
Annex 30A and mainly partitioned accordingly.
The document also contains a device group section defining the MIBs
for EPON form a device perspective, which are connected directly to
the IEEE 802.3ah layer2 specifications.
The document also provides amendments to the 802.3 MAU MIBs documents
for the EFM device type addition.

2.1 Relationship of the EFM EPON MIB to the Interfaces MIB, the
Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB and the MAU MIB EFM EPON interfaces
require implementation of Interfaces MIB [RFC2863], Ethernet-like
Interfaces MIB [RFC2665] and MAU-MIB [RFC3636].
The MIBs defined in this document are an extension for these MIBs. For
instance defining dot3MpcpRemoteMACAddress only while assuming the
local MAC address attribute is already defined in [RFC 2665].

2.2 Relationship of the EFM EPON MIB to the Generic EFM MIB
EFM EPON interfaces require implementation of Generic EFM MIB [draft-
ietf-hubmibùefm-mib]. This document defines general EFM attributes and
managed objects that are referred in the document.

2.3 Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to EFM EPON MIB
EPON devices require implementation of the EFM EPON MIBs which are

Internet-Draft                 EPON MIBs              April 29, 2004

specified in this document. The opposite is not required as it
possible to implement the EFM interfaces by itself.

2.4 Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to Optical interface MIB
EPON devices may implement the Optical interface MIB [RFC3591]. This
document defines optical interface attributes and managed objects that
are assumed to be used by an EPON device.

2.5 Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to bridge MIB
EPON OLT devices may implement the bridge MIBs [RFC1493], [RFC1525],
Where the LLIDs of the PON are referred as the bridge ports. This
document defines managed objects for a bridge that are assumed to be
used by an EPON OLT device which bridges the data between the LLIDs of
the PON.

3   MIB structure

This document includes two MIBs the first is the EFM EPON MIBs and the
second is the EPON device MIBs.
The EFM EPON MIBs defines the objects used for configuration and
description of the [802.3ah] P2MP section.
These MIB objects are included of three MIB groups.
The MPCP MIBs definition û MIBs related to [802.3ah] clause 64 Multi
Point Control Protocol attributes. In this MIB group:
The dot3MpcpTable defines the objects used for the configuration and
description of the status of MPCP compliant interfaces.
The dot3MpcpStatTable defines the statistics group for MPCP compliant
interfaces.

The OMPEmulation MIBs definitions û MIBs related to [802.3ah] clause
65 point to point emulation attributes. In this MIB group:
The dot3OmpEmulationTable defines the objects used for the
configuration    and description of the status of OMPEmulation
compliant interfaces.
The dot3OmpEmulationStatTable defines the statistics group for
OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.

The MAU MIBs definition including MAU type definitions and EPON MAU
managed object related to [802.3ah] clause 60 and clause 65.
The dot3EponMauTable defines the objects used for the configuration
and description of the status of MAU EPON compliant interfaces.
The dot3EponMauType defines the Type group for [802.3] EPOM MAUs.
Editor note - The MAU Type object should probably be with other 802.3
MAU type objects [RFC 3636].

The EPON Device MIBs defines the objects used for configuration and
description of management objects for EPON compliant Devices.
The eponDeviceTable defines the objects used for the configuration and
description of the EPON compliant devices.

7. Security Considerations

   There are number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. Most objects are writeable
   only when the link is Down. Writing to these objects can have the
   following potentially disruptive effects on network operation:
   Including:
     Changing dot3MpcpMode mode
     Changing dot3MPCPAdminControl state
     Changing eponDeviceObjectReportThreshold
     Changing dot3EponMauFecMode mode
     Changing eponDeviceObjectReset mode
     Changing eponDeviceObjectFecEnabled mode
     Changing eponDeviceObjectOamMode mode
     Changing eponDeviceObjectDeviceReadyMode
     Changing eponDeviceObjectPowerDown
     Changing eponDeviceObjectReportThreshold
     Changing eponDeviceRMadlLogID
     Changing eponDeviceRMadlLLID
     Changing eponDeviceRMadlRemoteMacAddress
     Changing eponDeviceRMadlType
     Changing eponDeviceRMadlAction
     Changing eponDeviceRMadlEntryStatus
     Changing eponDeviceSampleMinimum
     Changing eponDeviceDyingGaspAlarmEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceCriticalEventEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceLocalLinkFaultAlarmEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceTemperatureEventIndicationEnabled
     Changing eponDevicePowerVoltageEventIndicationEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceGlobalEventEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceErroredSymbolPeriodEventEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceErroredFrameEventEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceErroredFramePeriodEventEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceErroredFrameSecondsSummaryEventEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceOrganizationSpecificEventEnabled
     Changing eponDeviceEventControl
     Changing eponDeviceEventsLogID
     Changing eponDeviceEventsLogEntryStatus

The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
can have a negative effect on network operations.

The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control

EPON MIB WG                Expires October 2004              [Page 63]


Internet-Draft                 EPON MIBs              April 29, 2004

even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
MIB module.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
authentication and privacy).

Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
