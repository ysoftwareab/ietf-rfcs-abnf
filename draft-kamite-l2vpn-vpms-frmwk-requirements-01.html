<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
				This document provides a framework and service level requirements for
				Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS).  
				VPMS is defined as a Layer 2 VPN service that provides
				point-to-multipoint
				connectivity for a variety of Layer 2 link layers across an IP or
				MPLS-enabled PSN. 
				This document outlines architectural service models of VPMS
				and states generic and high level requirements.
				This is intended to aid in developing protocols and
				mechanisms to support VPMS.

Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
					<a class='info' href='#RFC4664'>[RFC4664]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L. and E. Rosen, &ldquo;Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> describes different types of
					Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs);
					Some of them are widely deployed today, such as
					Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and
					Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).
					A VPWS is a VPN service that supplies a
					Layer 2 (L2) point-to-point service.
					A VPLS is an L2 service that emulates Ethernet LAN service across
					a Wide Area Network (WAN).  
				
</p>
<p>
					For some use cases described hereafter, there are
					P2MP (point-to-multipoint) type services for Layer 2 
					traffic.  However, there is no straightforward way to realize them
					based on the existing L2VPN specifications.
				
</p>
<p>
					In a VPWS, a SP can set up point-to-point connectivity
					per a pair of CEs but it is impossible to
					replicate traffic for point-to-multipoint services
					in the SP's network side.
					Even though a SP can build multiple PWs independently
					and make the CEs to replicate traffic 
					over them, it is considered an inconvenient way for the customer
					and a waste of bandwidth resources.
				
</p>
<p>
					In a VPLS, SPs can naturally offer multipoint connectivity across
					their backbone.  Although it is seemingly applicable
					for point-to-multipoint service as well, there remains 
					extra work for SPs to filter unnecessary traffic between
					irrelevant sites (i.e., from a receiver PE to another receiver PE)
					because VPLS provides full-mesh multipoint-to-multipoint
					connectivity between CEs.  Moreover, VPLS's MAC-based
					learning/forwarding operation is considered
					unnecessary for some scenarios particularly if customers
					just want to have simple unidirectional point-to-multipoint service,
					or if they require non-Ethernet Layer 2 connectivity.
				
</p>
<p>
					Consequently, There is a real need for a solution
					that natively provides point-to-multipoint service in L2VPN.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Scope of This Document</h3>

<p>
					VPMS is defined as a Layer 2 service that provides point-to-multipoint
					connectivity for a variety of Layer2 link layers across an IP or
					MPLS-enabled PSN.  VPMS is categorized as a form of 
					provider-provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN).
				
</p>
<p>
					This document introduces a new service framework, reference
					model and functional requirements for
					VPMS within the context of L2VPN, on top of the existing
					framework <a class='info' href='#RFC4664'>[RFC4664]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L. and E. Rosen, &ldquo;Framework for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and requirements
					<a class='info' href='#RFC4665'>[RFC4665]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Augustyn, W. and Y. Serbest, &ldquo;Service Requirements for Layer 2 Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
					It is intended to show a proper reference to introduce VPMS and
					a checklist of requirements
					that will provide a consistent way to evaluate how well each
					solution satisfies the requirements.
				
</p>
<p>
					The technical specifications are outside the scope of this
					document. There is no intent to specify
					solution-specific details.
				
</p>
<p>
					This document provides requirements from both the Service Provider's
					and the Customer's point of view.

Ethernet Use Case</h3>

<p>
					For multicast traffic delivery, there is a requirement to deliver a
					unidirectional P2MP service in addition to the existing P2P service.
					The demand is growing to provide private services which support
					Ethernet traffic duplication, for various applications such as
					IP-based delivery of TV
					broadcasting, content delivery networks, etc.  Moreover, many digital
					audio/video devices (e.g., MPEG-TS, HD-SDI) that supports Ethernet
					interfaces are becoming available, which will make Ethernet
					P2MP service more common.  Also there are some applications that
					naturally suited to static transport of VPMS.  For example, MPEG-TS/IP/
					Ethernet in DVB-H is typically static broadcast without any signaling
					in the upstream direction.  VPMS could be a possible solution to
					provide these kinds of networking connectivity over PSNs.
				
</p>
<p>
				   Currently VPLS [RFC4761][RFC4762] is able to give P2MP-type
				   replication for Ethernet traffic.  Native VPLS already supports this
				   capability via a full mesh of PWs, and an extension to optimize
				   replication is also proposed [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] as an
				   additional feature. However, VPLS by nature requires MAC-based
				   learning and forwarding, which might not be needed in some cases by
				   particular users.  Generally, video distribution applications use unidirectional P2MP traffic, but may not always require any added
				   expense of MAC address management.  In addition, VPLS is a service
				   that essentially provides any-to-any connectivity between all CEs in
				   a L2VPN as it emulates a LAN service. However, if only P2MP
				   connectivity is required, the traffic between different receivers is not always
				   needed, and traffic from receiver to sender is not always needed,
				   either.  In these cases, VPMS is a service that provides much simpler
				   operation.
				
</p>
<p>
				   Note that VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership; that
				   is, there is no distinct differentiation about multiple multicast
				   groups.  All traffic from a particular Attachment Circuit (AC) will
				   flow toward the same remote receivers, even if the destination MAC
				   address is changed.  Basically in VPMS, destination MAC addresses are
				   not used for forwarding, which is significantly different from VPLS.
				   If MAC-based forwarding is preferred (i.e., multicast/unicast
				   differentiation of MAC address), VPLS should be chosen rather than
				   VPMS.

ATM-based Use Case</h3>

<p>
					A use case of ATM-based service in VPMS could be to offer the
					capability for 
					service providers to support IP multicast wholesale services over
					ATM
					in case the wholesale customer relies on ATM infrastructure. The 
					P2MP support alleviates the constraint in terms of replication for ATM to 
					support IP multicast services. 
				
</p>
<p>
					   Another use case of VPMS for ATM is for audio/video stream
					   applications.  Today many digital TV broadcasting networks adopt ATM-
					   based distribution systems with point-to-multipoint PVPs/PVCs.  The
					   transport network supports replicating ATM cells in transit nodes to
					   efficiently deliver programs to multiple terminals.  For migrating
					   such ATM-based networks onto IP/MPLS-based networks, VPMS is considered to be
					   a candidate solution.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
TDM-based Use Case</h3>

<p>
					   Today the existing VPWS already supports TDM emulation services
					   (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP).  It is a Layer 1 service, not Layer 2
					   service; however, a common architecture is being used since they are
					   all packet-based emulations over a SP's network.  VPMS is also considered to be a solution for such TDM applications that require
					   point-to-multipoint topology.
				
</p>
<p>
					   In a PSN environment, the existing VPWS allows support for 2G/3G
					   mobile backhauling (e.g.  TDM traffic for GSM's Abis interface, ATM
					   traffic for Release 99 UMTS's Iub interface).  Currently, the
					   Mobile backhauling architecture is always built as a star topology
					   between the 2G/3G controller (e.g.  BSC or RNC) and the 2G/3G Base
					   Stations (BTS or NodeB).  Therefore VPWSes (P2P services) are used
					   between each Base Station and their corresponding controller and
					   nothing more is required.
				
</p>
<p>
					   As far as synchronization in a PSN environment is concerned,
					   different mechanisms can be considered to provide frequency and phase
					   clock required in the 2G/3G Mobile environment to guarantee mobile
					   handover and strict QoS.  One of them consists of using Adaptive
					   Clock Distribution and Recovery.  With this method a Master element
					   distributes a reference clock at protocol level by regularly sending
					   TDM PW packets (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP) to Slave elements.  This
					   process is based on the fact that the volume of transmitted data
					   arrival is considered as an indication of the source frequency that
					   could be used by the Slave element to recover the source clock
					   frequency.  Consequently, with the current methods, the PE connected
					   to the Master must setup and maintain as many VPWS (P2P) as their are
					   Slave elements, and the Master has to replicate the traffic.  A
					   better solution to deliver the clock frequency would be to use a VPMS
					   which supports P2MP traffic.  This may scale better than P2P
					   services (VPWS) with regards to the forwarding plane at the Master
					   since the traffic is no longer replicated to individual VPWSes (P2P)
					   but only to the AC associated to the VPMS (P2MP).  It may ease the
					   provisioning process since only one source endpoint must be
					   configured at the Ingress PE.  This alleviated provisioning process
					   would simplify the introduction of new Base
					   Stations.  The main gain would be to avoid replication on the Master
					   and hence save bandwidth consumed by the synchronization traffic
					   which typically requires the highest level of QoS.  This kind of
					   traffic will be competing with equivalent QOS traffic like VoIP, which
					   is why it is significant to save the slightest bandwidth.

<p>
				A single VPMS instance provides
				isolated service reachability domains to each customer. 
				One VPMS instance corresponds to a unique unidirectional
				point-to-multipoint service.
				In Figure 1, there are two VPMS instances shown,
				VPMS A and VPMS B.  In principle, there is no traffic exchange
				allowed between these different instances.
			
</p>
<p>
				In a VPMS, a single CE-PE connection is used for transmitting frames
				for delivery to multiple remote CEs, with point-to-multipoint duplication.
				The SP's network (PE as well as P) has a role to duplicate frames so that
				The traffic source does not need to send multiple frames to individual
				receivers.
			
</p>
<p>
				In a VPMS, there are two types of CE, senders and receivers.
				A sender CE can send out traffic
				as a source into a VPMS instance.  A receiver CE can receive traffic
				from a sender site, but cannot receive from other receiver CEs.
				A sender CE itself does not have capability of receiving traffic.
			
</p>
<p>
				Like VPWS, an Attachment Circuit (AC) is provided to accommodate CEs
				in a VPMS.  In a VPMS, an AC attached to a VPMS MUST be configured as
				"sender" or "receiver" not both.  That is, any AC is associated with
				the role of either sending side (Tx) or receiving side (Rx) from the
				view of the CE.  Thus every AC deals with unidirectional traffic flows.
				In Figure 1, AC1 and AC3 are configured as senders while AC2,
				AC4, AC5 and AC6 are configured as receivers.  CE1 could send traffic to
				VPMS A via AC1, but it could also receive traffic from VPMS B if
				another AC is connected to CE1.
			
</p>
<p>
				Basically there is a
				one-to-one mapping between an attachment circuit and
				each customer's P2MP topology.
				A unique VPMS instance corresponds to each topology.
				For example, all traffic from CE1 to PE1 (thorough AC1) is mapped to
				VPMS A's topology (to CE2 and CE5).
			
</p>
<p>
				In the context of VPMS, one "VPN" is a specific set of sites that
				have been configured to allow communication, composed of one
				or more sets of VPMS instances.  The customer's administrative
				policies may allow sender and receiver CEs to be overlapped by multiple
				VPMS instances (for details, see Section 6.1. as an example).  A VPN
				will be finally defined by those VPMS instance sets.  In short, VPMS
				is defined as a common point-to-multipoint (P2MP) delivery
				topology, and the customer's administrative policy will determine the
				real VPN domain in the broad sense by picking up one or more VPMS
				instances.
			
</p>
<p>
				In a VPMS, PEs will be connected using PW technology which may
				include P2MP traffic optimization.  P2MP traffic optimization will
				provide the benefit of traffic replication for high bandwidth efficiency.
				The sender CE has only to transmit one stream towards the PE, it does not have to replicate traffic.  The backbone side is a IP or MPLS-enabled routed PSN.
			
</p>
<p>
				VPMS can support various Layer 2 protocol services
				such as Ethernet, ATM, etc.

Point-to-Multipoint Support</h3>

						A solution MUST support unidirectional point-to-multipoint
						connectivity from a sender to multiple receivers.
						A sender CE is assured to send traffic to one or more receiver CEs.
						Receiver CEs include not only the CEs which are located at remote sites,

						If there is only one receiver in the instance, it is considered equivalent to

Multiple Source Support</h3>

<p>
						A solution MUST support multiple sender topologies in one VPMS
						instance, where a common receiver group is reachable from two or more
						senders.  This means that a solution needs to support having multiple
						P2MP topologies in the backbone whose roots are located apart in a
						common service. In other words, each P2MP topology MUST only have a single sender, however multiple P2MP topologies can be grouped together into a single VPMS instance.
						For example, in Figure 2, traffic from sender CE1
						and CE2 both reach receivers CE3 and CE4 while CE1, CE2, CE3 and CE4
						all are associated with a single service.  This topology is useful
						for increasing service reliability by redundant sources.  Note that
						every receiver has only to have one AC connected to each PE to
						receive traffic. (in Figure 2, AC3 and AC4 respectively).  Thus a
						solution will also need to support protection and restoration
						mechanism combining these multiple P2MP topologies.  (See section 6.4
						too).

Reverse Traffic Support</h3>

<p>
						There are cases where a reverse traffic flow is necessary.  A sender CE
						might sometimes want to receive traffic from a receiver CE.
						There are some usage scenarios for this, such as stream monitoring through a
						loopback mechanism, control channels which need feedback communication
						etc.  The simplest way to accomplish this is to provide different
						VPMS instances for reverse traffic, i.e. a sender CE is a receiver
						of another VPMS instance.
					
</p>
<p>
						Figure 3 illustrates this kind of reverse traffic scenario,
						where CE1 is configured as a sender in VPMS A and a receiver
						in VPMS B. VPMS B is used for reverse traffic.
						Note that a closed single
						network here is composed of two VPMS instances.  In operational
						terms, CE1 and CE4 belong to the same closed "VPN" by
						administrative policy (e.g., CE1,
						CE2, CE3 and CE4 are the devices in one enterprise's intranet
						network).
					
</p>
<p>
						Such bi-directional instances can be easily created if two distinct
						ACs are provisioned for sending and receiving exclusively (e.g., if
						VLAN id in dot1Q tagged frame is a service delimiter, different VLAN
						ids are uniquely allocated for Tx and Rx).  This approach is
						acceptable if a receiver CE device can change Layer 2 interface
						appropriately in data transmitting and receiving.
					
</p>
<p>
						Meanwhile it is also true that this might be considered a limitation
						in some deployment scenarios.  If a CE is an IP router or Ethernet
						bridge, reverse traffic is normally expected to be received on the
						same interface as forward traffic on the receiver CE. (i.e., the same VLAN id is to be
						used for reverse traffic if the AC supports dot1Q tagged frames.)
					
</p>
<p>
						Therefore, in a VPMS solution,
						both of the two type of ACs, sending (Tx) and receiving (Rx), 
						SHOULD be allowed to be placed in the same physical/virtual
						circuit.
						In Figure 3, suppose 
						AC5 of VPMS A is provisioned as {VLAN id = 100, direction= Rx}.
						It is expected that operators can provision AC6 of VPMS B 
						in the same physical port as
						{VLAN id = 100, direction = Tx} or as
						{VLAN id = 101, direction = Tx}.
						That is, the combination between VLAN id and the flow direction 
						is now considered to be a service delimiter.
					
</p>
<p>
						Note, in most implementations of VPWS today, every AC is always
						considered bidirectional and a unique Layer 2 header/circuit (ATM
						VPI/VCI, an Ethernet port, a VLAN etc.) is considered the service
						delimiter.  In contrast in VPMS, every AC is considered
						unidirectional and traffic direction is an additional element to
						identify a unique AC.

Transparency</h3>

Quality of Service (QoS)</h3>

<p>
					A customer may require that the VPMS service provide the guaranteed QoS.
					In particular, for real time applications which are considered common
					in point-to-multipoint delivery, delay and loss sensitive traffic
					MUST be supported.  The solution SHOULD provide native QoS techniques
					for service class differentiation, 
					such as IEEE 802.1p CoS for Ethernet.
				
</p>
<p>
					For bandwidth committed services (e.g., ATM CBR),
					a solution SHOULD guarantee end-to-end bandwidth.
					It MAY provide flow admission control mechanisms to achieve that.

<a name="rfc.section.6.4"></a><h3>6.4.&nbsp;
Protection and Restoration</h3>

<p>
					A solution MUST provide protection and restoration mechanism
					for end-to-end services.
				
</p>
<p>
					A solution MUST allow dual-homed redundant access from a CE to
					multiple PEs.  Additionally, a solution SHOULD provide
					protection mechanism between the different PEs to which a CE is attached.  This is because
					when an ingress PE node fails whole traffic delivery will fail unless
					a backup sender PE is provided, even in case of dual-homed access.
					Similarly, if an egress PE node fails, traffic toward that CE is never
					received unless a backup egress PE is provided.  Figure 4 is an example for this access topology.
				
</p>
<p>
					When dual-homed access to sender PEs is provided, a sender CE MAY
					transmit just a single copy of the traffic to either one of the two sender PEs, or it MAY
					transmit a copy of the traffic to both the PEs simultaneously.  The latter
					scenario is usually applicable when a source device has only a simple
					forwarding capability without any switchover functionality.  Note
					that it consumes more resources at CE-PE than in the single copy case.  In the
					dual traffic case, the backup ingress PE SHOULD be able to
					filter unnecessary traffic under normal conditions.  Also in either case,
					single traffic or dual traffic, the protection mechanism of ingress
					PEs described in the previous paragraph will be necessary to handle
					the traffic appropriately.
				
</p>
<p>
					In the case of dual-homed access to receiver PEs, a receiver CE MAY
					receive a single copy of the traffic from either one of the two sender PEs, or receive
					a copy of the traffic from both PEs simultaneously.  It might be needed to
					support switchover mechanism between egress PEs in failure.  The dual
					traffic approach is applicable if CE has fast switchover capability
					as a receiver, but note that additional traffic resources are always
					consumed at PE-CE.

Pseudo Wire Signaling and PSN Tunneling</h3>

					A VPMS solution SHOULD provide an efficient replication that can

Activation and Deactivation</h3>

<p>
					This section raises generic requirements for handling related
					information about remote sites after the initial provisioning to ease the
					total operation of VPMS.
				
</p>
<p>
					A solution SHOULD provide a way to 
					activate/deactivate the administrative status of each CE/AC.
					After initial provisioning, 
					a SP might change connectivity configuration 
					between particular CEs inside a single VPMS instance
					for operational reasons.  This feature will be beneficial to
					help such a scenario.
				
</p>
<p>
					For example, in Figure 5,
					CE1, CE3, CE4 and CE5 (and their ACs) are initially provisioned 
					for VPMS A.  CE2 is not provisioned for any VPMSes.  In VPMS A, CE1 is
					a sender and CE3, CE4 and CE5 are receivers.
					Traffic will usually flow from CE1 to all
					receivers, CE3, CE4 and CE5.  However, for maintenance operation,
					application's request (e.g., stream program has changed) or some other reasons,
					CE4 needs to
					be set as administratively deactivated.  Then it becomes necessary to
					turn off traffic from PE4 to CE4.  This operation
					must be appropriately distinguished from failure cases.
				
</p>
<p>
					When deactivating a particular site, backbone PSN/PW resources (e.g.,
					admission control of PSN tunnel) MAY be released for that particular
					direction in order to provide that bandwidth to other services.  In
					Figure 5, CE3 is now administratively activated and receiving traffic.
					However, if CE3 comes to be administratively deactivated, and if
					RSVP-TE (including P2P and/or P2MP) is used for backbone PSN, then TE
					reserved resources from PE1 to PE3 may be released.
				
</p>
<p>
					In addition, a solution SHOULD allow single-sided activation
					operation at a sender PE.  In some scenarios, operators prefer
					centralized operation.  This is often considered natural for one-way
					digital audio/video distribution applications: SPs often want to
					complete their service delivery by a single operation at one source
					PE, not by multiple operations at many receiver PEs.  Figure 5
					illustrates this scenario, where a SP only has to do single-sided
					operation at PE1 (source) to administratively activate/deactivate
					various connections from AC1 to AC3, AC4 and/or AC5.  It is not
					needed to perform operations on PE3 and PE4 directly.
