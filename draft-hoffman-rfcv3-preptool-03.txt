1.  Introduction

   As a part of the new HTML format work, the RFC Editor has decided
   that the XML2RFCv3 vocabulary [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc] will be
   canonical, in the sense that it is the data that is blessed by the
   process as the actual RFC.  See [RFC6949] for more detail on this.

   Most people will read other formats, such as HTML, PDF, ASCII text,
   or other formats of the future, however.  In order to ensure each of
   these format is as similar as possible to one another as well as the
   canonical XML, there is a desire for the translation from XML into
   the other formats will be straightforward syntactic translation.  To
   make that happen, a good amount of data will need to be in the XML
   format that is not there today.  That data will be added by a program
   called the "prep tool", which will often run as a part of the xml2rfc
   process.

   This draft specifies the steps that the prep tool will have to take.
   As changes to [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc] are made, this document will be
   updated.

2.  v3 Prep Tool Usage Scenarios

   The prep tool will have several settings:

   o  Internet-Draft preparation

   o  Canonical RFC preparation

   There are only a few difference between the two settings.  For
   example, the boilerplate output will be different, as will the date
   output on the front page.

Internet-Draft        RFC v3 Prep Tool Description             June 2015


   Note that this only describes what the IETF-sponsored prep tool does.
   Others might create their own work-alike prep tools for their own
   formatting needs.  However, an output format developer does not not
   need to change the prep tool in order to create their own formatter:
   they only need to be able to consume prepared text.

   This tool is described as if it is a separate tool so that we can
   reason about its architectural properties.  In actual implementation,
   it might be a part of a larger suite of functionality.

3.  Internet-Draft Submission

   When the IETF draft submission tool accepts v3 XML as an input
   format, the submission tool runs the submitted file through the prep
   tool.  If the tool finds no errors, it keeps two XML files: the
   submitted file and the prepped file.

   The prepped file provides a record of what a submitter was attesting
   to at the time of submission.  It represents a self-contained record
   of what any external references resolved to at the time of
   submission.

   The prepped file is used by the IETF formatters to create outputs
   such as HTML, PDF, and text (or the tools act in a way
   indistinguishable from this).  The message sent out by the draft
   submission tool includes a link to the original XML as well as the
   other outputs, including the prepped XML.

   The prepped XML can be used by tools not yet developed to output new
   formats that have as similar output as possible to the current IETF
   formatters.  For example, if the IETF creates a .mobi output renderer
   later, it can run that renderer on all of the prepped XML that has
   been saved, ensuring that the content of included external references
   and all of the part numbers and boilerplate will be the same as what
   was produced by the previous IETF formatters at the time the document
   was first uploaded.

4.  Canonical RFC Preparation

   During AUTH48, the RPC will run the prep tool in canonical RFC
   preparation mode and make the results available to the authors so
   they can see what the final output might look like.  When the
   document is done with AUTH48 review, the RPC runs the prep tool in
   canonical RFC preparation mode one last time, locks down the
   canonicalized XML, runs the formatters for the non-canonical output
   formats, and publishes all of those.  It is probably a good idea for
   the RPC to keep a copy of the input XML file from the various steps
   of the RFC production process.

Internet-Draft        RFC v3 Prep Tool Description             June 2015


   Similarly to I-D's, the prepped XML can be used later to re-render
   the output formats, or to generate new formats.

5.  What the v3 Prep Tool Does

   The steps listed here are in order of processing.  In all cases where
   the prep tool would "add" an attribute or element, if that attribute
   or element already exists, the prep tool will check that the
   attribute or element is correct.  If the value is incorrect, the prep
   tool will warn with the old and new values, then replace the
   incorrect value with the new value.

   1.   Fully process any DTDs in the input document, then remove the
        DTD.  At a minimum, this entails processing the entityrefs and
        includes for external files.

   2.   Process all <x:include> elements.  Note: <x:include>d XML may
        include more <x:include>s (with relative URLs rooted at the
        xml:base).  The tool may be configurable with a limit on the
        depth of recursion.

   3.   If in RFC production mode:

        *  Remove comments.

        *  Remove processing instructions.

   4.   Add the [RFC5741] boilerplate text with current values.
        However, if different boilerplate text already exists in the
        input, produce a warning that says that other tools,
        specifically the draft submission tool, will treat that
        condition as an error.  The application will use the "ipr",
        "category", "submission", and "consensus" attributes of the
        <rfc> element to determine which [RFC5741] boilerplate to
        include, as described in Appendix A of [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc].

   5.   Fill in the "prepTime" attribute of <rfc> with the current
        datetime.

   6.   If in I-D mode, if there is a <note> element with a
        "removeInRFC" attribute, add a paragraph to the top of the
        <note> element that says "This note is to be removed before
        publishing as an RFC".

   7.   If in I-D mode, if there is a <date> element in the document's
        <front> element, and that date is earlier than today, it is an
        error.

   8.   If in I-D mode, fill in "expiresDate" attribute of <rfc> based
        on the the <date> element of the document's <front> element, if
        there is one.

   9.   Fill in any default values for attributes on elements, except
        "keepWithNext" and "keepWithPrevious" of <t>, and "toc" of
        <section>.

   10.  If the <workgroup> content doesn't end with "Group", issue a
        warning.

   11.  Sanity-check the value of the "obsoletes" and "updates"
        attributes in the <rfc> element and give a waring if the sanity
        check fails.

   12.  For each <section> element that has a "numbered" attribute set
        to "false", verify that the section is either followed by a
        section at the top level, or is not followed by another section
        that does not contain the "numbered" attribute set to "false";
        if both tests fail, it is an error.

   13.  Add a "slugifiedName" attribute to each <name> element that does
        not contain one; replace the attribute if it contains a value
        that begins with "n-".

   14.  Add "pn" attributes for all parts.  Parts are:

        *  <section>: pn='s-1.4.2'

        *  <abstract>: pn='s-abstract'

        *  <note>: pn='s-note-[counter]'

        *  <table>: pn='t-3'

        *  <figure>: pn='f-4'

        *  <artwork>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <dl>, <dt>, <li>, <ol>,
           <references>, <sourcecode>, <t>, <ul>:
           pn='p-[section]-[counter]'

   15.  Add a "start" attribute to every <ol> element containing a group
        that doesn't already have a start.

   16.  Look for groups of <postalLine> elements; if found, emit them in
        the order they are seen.

   17.  Sort the references, if "sortRefs" of <rfc> is true.

   18.  For each <xref> element, give an error if there is no "target"
        attribute, or if that attribute is not an anchor in another
        element.

   19.  For each <xref> element that has content, fill the
        "derivedContent" with the element content.  Issue a warning if
        the "derivedContent" attribute already exists and has a
        different value than what was being filled in.

   20.  For each <xref> element that does not have content, fill the
        "derivedContent" based on the "format" attribute.  For
        format='counter', the "derivedContent" is the section, figure,
        table, or ordered list number.  For format='default' and the
        "target" attribute points to a <reference> or <referencegroup>
        element, the "derivedContent" is the value of the "target"
        attribute.  For format='default' and the "target" attribute
        points something else, the "derivedContent" is the title of the
        thing pointed to, such as "Section 2.3" or "Table 4".  For
        format='title', if the target is a <reference> element, the
        "derivedContent" attribute is the name of the reference,
        extracted from the <title> child of the <front> child of the
        reference.  For format='title', if the target element has a
        <name> child element, the "derivedContent" attribute is the text
        content of that <name> element concatenated with the text
        content of each descendant node of <name> (that is, stripping
        out all of the XML markup, leaving only the text).
        For format='title', if the target element does not contain a
        <name> child element, the "derivedContent" attribute is the name
        of the "anchor" attribute of that element with no other
        adornment.  Issue a warning if the "derivedContent" attribute
        already exists and has a different value than what was being
        filled in.

   21.  For each <relref> element, give an error if there is no "target"
        attribute, or if that attribute is not an anchor in a
        <reference&;gt; or <referencegroup&;gt; element.

   22.  For each <relref> element, if the element has neither a
        "relative" nor a "section" attribute, give an error.

   23.  For each <relref> element, if the element has both a "relative"
        nor a "section" attribute, give an error.

   24.  For each <relref> element, fill in the "derivedLink" attribute.

   25.  For each <relref> element that does not have content, fill
        the"derivedRemoteContent" based on the content of the target
        reference.  If the target reference is a RFC or Internet-Draft

        in the v3 format, and the anchor given in the "relative"
        attribute or derived from the "section" attribute is not in the
        target refernence, give an error.  If the target reference is a
        RFC or Internet-Draft in the v3 format, find the anchor given in
        the "relative" attribute or derived from the "section"
        attribute, and use the identifier of that element (such as
        "Section 2.3" or "Table 4") for the "derivedRemoteContent".  If
        the target reference is not a RFC or Internet-Draft in the v3
        format, use the value of the "relative" or "section" attribute
        for the "derivedRemoteContent".  Issue a warning if that
        attribute already exists and has a different value than what was
        being filled in.  Issue a warning if the "derivedRemoteContent"
        attribute already exists and has a different value than what was
        being filled in.

   26.  For each <relref> element that has content, fill the
        "derivedRemoteContent" with the element content.  Issue a
        warning if the "derivedRemoteContent" attribute already exists
        and has a different value than what was being filled in.

   27.  If an <artwork> element has both a "src" attribute and there is
        any existing content, give an error.

   28.  If an <artwork> element has a "src" attribute with no scheme is
        specified, treat the scheme as "file:" in a path relative to the
        file being processed.  This will likely be one of the most
        common authoring approaches.

   29.  If an <artwork> element has a "src" attribute with a "file:"
        scheme, and if processing the URL would cause the processor to
        retrieve a file that is not in the same directory, or a
        subdirectory, as the file being processed, give an error.  This
        rule attempts to prevent <artwork src='file:///etc/passwd'> and
        similar security issues.

   30.  If an <artwork> element has a "src" attribute URI scheme that is
        not "data:", "file:", "http:", or "https:", give an error.

   31.  If an <artwork> element has type='svg' and there is a "src"
        attribute, the data needs to be moved into the content of the
        <artwork> element.

        *  If the "src" URI scheme is "data:", fill the content of the
           <artwork> element with that data and remove the "src"
           attribute.  If the mediatype of the data: URI is not "image/
           svg+xml", error.

        *  If the "src" URI scheme is "file:", "http:", or "https:",
           fill the content of the <artwork> element with the resolved
           XML from the URI in the "src" attribute.  Add an
           "originalSrc" attribute with the value of the URI and remove
           the "src" attribute.

   32.  If an <artwork> element has type='svg', check the SVG schema of
        the resulting content against the profile in
        [I-D.brownlee-svg-rfc].  If it does not pass the check, give an
        error (?) or strip the offending content (?).

   33.  If an <artwork> element has type='binary-art', the data needs to
        be in a "src" attribute with a URI scheme of "data:".

        *  If the element has content, give an error.

        *  If in RFC production mode, give an error.

        *  If the "src" URI scheme is "file:", "http:", or "https:",
           resolve the URL.  Replace the "src" attribute with a "data:"
           URI, add an "originalSrc" attribute with the value of the
           URI, and remove the "src" attribute.  For the "http:" and
           "https:" URI schemes, the mediatype of the "data:" URI will
           be the Content-Type of the HTTP response.  For the "file:"
           URI scheme, the mediatype of the "data:" URI needs to be
           guessed with heuristics (this is possibly a bad idea).  Note:
           since this feature can't be used for RFCs at the moment, this
           entire feature might be de-prioritized.

   34.  If an <artwork> element does not have type='svg' or
        type='binary-art' and there is a "src" attribute, the data needs
        to be moved into the content of the <artwork> element.  Note
        that this step assumes that all of the preferred types other
        than "binary-art" are text.

        *  If the "src" URI scheme is "data:", fill the content of the
           <artwork> element with the correctly-escaped form of that
           data and remove the "src" attribute.

        *  If the "src" URI scheme is "file:", "http:", or "https:",
           fill the content of the <artwork> element with the correctly-
           escaped form of the resolved text from the URI in the "src"
           attribute.  Add an "originalSrc" attribute with the value of
           the URI and remove the "src" attribute.

   35.  If a <sourcecode> element has both a "src" attribute and there
        is any existing content, give an error.

   36.  If a <sourcecode> element has a "src" attribute with no scheme
        is specified, treat the scheme as "file:" in a path relative to
        the file being processed.

   37.  If a <sourcecode> element has a "src" attribute with a "file:"
        scheme, and if processing the URL would cause the processor to
        retrieve a file that is not in the same directory, or a
        subdirectory, as the file being processed, give an error.  This
        rule attempts to prevent <artwork src='file:///etc/passwd'> and
        similar security issues.

   38.  If a <sourcecode> element has a "src" attribute URI scheme that
        is not "data:", "file:", "http:", or "https:", give an error.

   39.  If a <sourcecode> element has a "src" attribute, the data needs
        to be moved into the content of the <sourcecode> element.

        *  If the "src" URI scheme is "data:", fill the content of the
           <sourcecode> element with the appropriately-escaped data and
           remove the "src" attribute.

        *  If the "src" URI scheme is "file:", "http:", or "https:",
           fill the content of the <sourcecode> element with the
           appropriately-escaped resolved text from the URI in the "src"
           attribute.  Add an "originalSrc" attribute with the value of
           the URI and remove the "src" attribute.

   40.  If an <sourcecode> element has a "type" attribute that matches
        one of the known types, and that type has code that can validate
        the code, do the validation (noting that elements that have the
        same "name" attribute should be collected) and give a warning if
        the validation fails.

   41.  Add a <link> child element to <rfc> for the DOI, if in RFC
        production mode.

   42.  Determine all the characters used in the document, and fill in
        "scripts" attribute for <rfc>.

   43.  Ensure that the output has the "version" attribute of <rfc>, and
        that it is set to "3".

   44.  Prepare the index, if one is called for in the document.  The
        steps for doing that is out of scope for this document.

   45.  If in I-D mode, check if there is a <link> element with an ISSN
        for the RFC series; if so, delete it.

   46.  If in I-D mode, check if there is a <link> element with a DOI
        for this draft; if so, delete it.

   51.  Pretty-format the XML output.  (Note: tools like
        https://github.com/hildjj/dentin do an adequate job.)

   52.  If in RFC production mode, ensure that the result is in full
        compliance to v3 schema, without any deprecated elements or
        attributes, and give an error if any issues are found.

6.  Additional Uses for the Prep Tool

   There will be a need for Internet-Draft authors who include files
   from their local disk (such as for <artwork src="mydrawing.svg"/>) to
   have the contents of those files inlined to their drafts before
   submitting them to the Internet-Draft processor.  (There is a
   possibility that the Internet-Draft processor will allow XML files
   and accompanying files to be submitted at the same time, but this
   seems troublesome from a security, portability, and complexity
   standpoint.)  For these users, having a local copy of the prep tool
   that has an option to just inline all local files would be terribly
   useful.  That option would be a proper subset of the steps given in
   Section 5.

   A feature that might be useful in a local prep tool would be the
   inverse of the "just inline" option would be "extract all".  This
   would allow a user who has a v3 RFC or Internet-Draft to dump all of
   the <artwork> and <sourcecode> elements into local files instead of
   having to find each one in the XML.  This option might even do as
   much validation as possible on the extracted <sourcecode> elements.
   This feature might also remove some of the features added by the prep
   tool (such as part numbers and slugifiedName's starting with "n-") in
   order to make the resulting file easier to edit.
