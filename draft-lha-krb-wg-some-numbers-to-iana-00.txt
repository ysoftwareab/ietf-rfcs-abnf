                    Kerberos number registry to IANA
                draft-lha-krb-wg-some-numbers-to-iana-00

Abstract

   Kerberos have many registers where only some have been registered,
   this document tries to cover the rest of them.  There is a private
   space but that can not be used for implementation in released
   software.  Also private is not avaible for all types.  This document
   moves control over the numbers to an IANA number registerty.

2.  Background

   [RFC4120] and other draft, RFC and private documents currently
   defines uses of Kerberos protocol numbers, after serveral confusions
   and collisions in shipped code its time to move them to an IANA
   registerty.

3.  Registration procedures

   A Kerberos number registration have the same "Registration
   procedures" for number based registration.

   Exceptions are: Error codes and Key Usage Numbers.

   o  0-65536: Specification Required, expert review (krb-wg mailing-
      list) that the specification is implementable in an interopable
