Abstract

   This document provides use cases for the configuration and management
   of SIP-based devices (SIP client and applications) based on available
   IETF protocols and related methodologies.  The use cases have been
   made generic enough to take into account common network topologies
   and requirements in SIP service deployments.
   Based on the use cases, we present a preliminary analysis of
   available IETF protocols that meet these requirements and highlight
   some of the limitations.

   Finally, a summary section captures the main findings to generate
   further discussion with the relevant IETF working groups.  It is the
   intent of the authors to seek general feedback from the IETF
   community on the approaches outlined in this document, especially in
   the OPS area and in SIPPING.

Internet-Draft  SIP Config and Management Considerations   February 2006


1.  Overview

   A couple of IETF working groups, OPS area and BoF meetings have
   reported the various emerging models and requirements to configure
   devices or applications and perform some monitoring or element
   management of such devices or apps.
   Various working groups are also defining the new IETF toolkit
   available to end-users, product vendors, enterprises and service
   providers to meet these configuration and element management
   requirements, including NETCONF, ISMS, SIP, SIPPING, SIMPLE, CallHome
   BoF to cite a few.
   At the same time, many IP networks are seeing a shift in the types
   and variety of SIP-based communication clients being used and the
   associated configuration and management needs are evolving.
   A communication client may be software or hardware-based, embedded
   into an access network bridge or router, or a standalone device; it
   may operate on diverse platforms (PDAs, PCs, Mobile phones, home
   router) and operating systems (real and non-real time), with
   differing requirements related to capabilities, memory and CPU
   constraints.
   As described in XCAP, multiple end-users can share a client and
   multiple clients can be bound to an end-user.

   In short, from a configuration and management standpoint, the above
   means:

   o  increased configuration requirements to handle multiple profiles
      and dynamic changes.
      Configuration changes may be generated by multiple sources: an
      end-user (based on application usage needs), a client (based on
      network conditions or profile usage), or an actor (admin user,
      enterprise IT or service provider sysadmin);

   o  support for configuration and management of clients with single or
      dual IP stacks with IPv4 and IPv6 support which may be behind NATs
      and firewalls.


   This document attempts to describe a basic scenario for configuring
   and managing SIP devices by providing a couple of common use cases
   and looking at the available solutions in the IETF toolkit.  Our goal
   is to show the design choices some folks are confronted with and
   underline open issues to support some of the current IETF work and,
   more importantly, outline some areas that potentially need more work.

Internet-Draft  SIP Config and Management Considerations   February 2006


2.  SIP UA Config and Management - Basic Scenario and Use Cases

   The basic scenario we use in this document is the one of an end-user,
   enterprise or service provider (an actor) wanting to configure and
   manage its SIP-based client and SIP-related application functionality
   by using available IETF protocols and existing element management
   tools (through various user interfaces: Command Line Interfaces, web-
   based views, or even management protocols via SNMP [RFC3411] for some
   categories of actors).  The SIP client may be dual-stack IPv4 and
   IPv6 and may or may not be behind a home-based or network-based NAT:
   this special case is only secondary and invoked in the third use
   case.

   We consider three use cases derived from this basic scenario:

   o  SIP client provisioning using XML-based configuration protocols
      with common management and data modeling techniques.
      The configuration of a SIP client is based on the use of IETF
      SIPPING Configuration framework ([ID-SIP-CFG]) and the IETF XCAP
      protocol ([ID-XCAP]) with the addition of commonly used MIB design
      methodologies using the Structure of Management Information (SMI)
      to solve the lack of XML data modeling.  The use case illustrates
      the shift in client configuration methodology and elaborates on
      how SNMP configuration is evolving into XML-based configuration.
      We insist on some SNMP-based modeling techniques that could be of
      valuable to re-use for describing data elements for the purpose of
      management: especially but not exclusively when the SNMP protocol
      is used for management in conjunction with XML configuration.

   o  Management of access control for SIP client configuration based on
      SIPPING-config and XCAP based on XML data modeling:
      When using the IETF SIPPING configuration framework and XML-based
      configuration via XCAP, the actor should have flexible means to
      define the type of access on a particular object or XCAP target
      (read, write, execute, notify, etc.).  Access control should also
      provide multiple access control levels for a particular object,
      similar to the UNIX access control lists: owner (user), group,
      others.

   o  Management of SIP devices behind NATs and firewalls:
      All types of actors want their SIP clients or devices to
      transparently operate behind well-behaved NATs and firewalls.  The
      use case takes the specific instance of a service provider or an
      enterprise wanting to manage IPv4-IPv6 SIP devices using CLI or
      protocols like SNMP or HTTP over secure transport.  We look at how
      management sessions for clients behind firewalls (and may be NATs)
      require from the use of SIP signaling stimulus.

   The next sections provide more details on the three distinct use
   cases and indicate potential solutions based on IETF protocols.

3.  Use Case 1: SIP client provisioning using XML-based configuration
    and data modeling

   In this section, we consider a SIP client being provisioned using
   XML-based configuration protocols (IETF SIPPING configuration
   framework and IETF XCAP protocol).  We investigate how re-using some
   of the commonly used MIB design methodologies may help to solve the
   lack of XML data modeling.

   While the intent of the use case is generic, taking a specific
   example of cable service providers should help provide some context.
   This may also be applicable to other actors, enterprises and service
   providers in particular.  The main point is not to insist on the use
   of SNMP but more importantly, to underline how engineers and
   implementers have used the SMI data model associated with SNMP to
   design configuration files.
   Traditionally, devices in cable networks (e.g.  DOCSIS(r) cable
   modems, PacketCable VoIP clients) have used SMI-based
   ([RFC1155],[RFC2578]) SNMP MIB modules as a means to represent both
   configuration and management data elements.  Device management is
   performed using the IETF SNMP protocols and recommendations.  The
   initial device configuration relies on a configuration file
   downloaded via TFTP or HTTP whose content includes TLV attributes
   (Type, Length, Value): each TLV in a typical client configuration
   file represents an SNMP variable binding: a configuration parameter
   and its initial value.

   This process is illustrated in Figure X1.  A cable device or client
   obtains its configuration file, populates the configuration
   parameters by 'internally' setting the corresponding SNMP MIB objects
   and proceeds to initialization of the supported services and is ready
   to be managed by element management systems based on SNMP.

   Note that the configuration file was provided using TFTP (or HTTP) on
   a one-time basis (during bootstrapping) as opposed to using a
   configuration protocol that can support dynamic changes.

   SNMP

   A couple of points are worth noting in the data modeling process:
   - Modeling data using SMI to create a MIB module may not always be
   perceived as adequate, elegant or efficient by many, but there are



Channabasappa & Mule     Expires August 30, 2006                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  SIP Config and Management Considerations   February 2006


   many design guideline documents available and it is used by the MIB
   designers in the IETF community.  The experience gained over the
   years is invaluable;
   - there are many tools available to check the syntax of MIB modules
   and enforce strict adherence to the SMI (e.g. boundaries for integer
   values, default values, formatting of the display of strings, re-
   usability of textual conventions facilitating interoperability and
   eliminating the parsing of free form strings, etc.);
   - there are numerous data models built on SMI that would benefit from
   being available in the XML-based data modeling world in support of
   configuration or management.

   Moving to the use case at hand, the increased client configuration
   requirements, the recognition that SNMP is rarely used for
   configuration (NETCONF), and the good work done by the IETF SIPPING
   working group on the configuration framework (([ID-SIP-CFG])) has led
   many to explore an XML-based configuration model.

   The configuration of SIP-based clients and devices in this example is
   based the configuration proposals available in the IETF for SIP User
   Agents (UAs) configuration, the eXtensible Markup Language
   Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) is chosen as the configuration
   protocol of choice for this use case.
   Client management is left unexplored by many proposals: it is not in
   scope of XCAP or not fully addressed by NETCONF.  In this use case,
   we propose to use SMI for three main reasons:
   1. to overcome the lack of XML data modeling for element management
   and configuration,
   2. to leverage the guidelines and experience in doing configuration
   and management modeling using well-defined techniques,
   3. to provide continuity for some actors that may manage devices
   using SNMP.
   This may be where the use case becomes more specific but we believe
   that even without the use of SNMP, re-using SMI brings some clear
   advantages.

   For these reasons, SMI-to-XML Schema transformations are accomplished
   to provide XML Schemas ([IR-SMI-XML]).  This enables the same
   operation as shown in Figure X1, but supports a full-fledged SIPPING
   and XCAP configuration protocols and allows SNMP management (SNMP
   management means SNMP for monitoring here (e.g.  GET), not for
   configuration (e.g.  SET)).

   Given the IETF does not have any standard XML-based data modeling
   proposals, the SMI-to-XML conversion mechanism seems to provide a
   stop-gap solution for supporting some element configuration.  It is
   important to realize that folks who do not want to deal with SMI or
   ASN.1 will obtain the derived XML schemas.  Rather than defining

   those schemas from scratch, SMI is used as an intermediary step.
   This may be seen as short-sighted but in the short term, and
   potentially long-term, it may provide a viable solution.

   Figure X3: Configuration of SIP clients via XCAP and Management via
   SNMP

   In conclusion, the co-authors believe that a well-defined XML data
   model for configuration and management is required.  While it has
   surfaced in some working groups (netconf [ID-NETCONF] for example),
   it is not available today.  The long-term solution may be to define a
   new model in IETF or elsewhere but in the short-term, given the
   availability of SMI design guidelines and tools, and the experience
   that can be leveraged from the SNMP community on configuration data
   design, the IETF should continue the work initiated on SMI-to-XML to
   provide a standard means to perform quick and reliable syntax
   conversions.

Internet-Draft  SIP Config and Management Considerations   February 2006


4.  Use Case 2: Access Control Definitions and XML-based configuration
    methodologies

   Access control definitions allow data model designers to choose
   access rights and restrictions for the defined data elements.  Most
   everyone is familiar with the UNIX ACL management associated with the
   file system: each file has read/write/execute access rights for the
   owner, group, and others.  The View-based Access Control Model (VACM)
   for SNMP is also a good reference as it is applied to configuration
   ([RFC3415]).

   In this use case, we look at the change in data ownership that is
   introduced by XML-based configuration models and protocols (XCAP as
   an example) and conclude that access control definitions for XML-
   based data models is a necessity.  This use may be viewed as an
   extension of the first one and it also shows some areas that are not
   addressed by the SMI-to-XML conversions.

   Use case description:
   A SIP client is configured using the SIPPING configuration framework
   and XCAP.  Changes in the configuration data elements may occur at
   multiple levels (write access): based on end-user settings on the SIP
   device, remote configuration changes (end-user accessing a web-based
   interface to change settings or a service operator updating the
   config), and many other means (software updates from device
   manufacturer changing some default configuration parameters, etc.).
   Furthermore, the presentation of some configuration data (read
   access) may also have to be controlled: not all users of a client may
   be allowed to change the settings, some settings may be hidden by the
   protocol stacks, device manufacturers or service providers so that
   end-users may not misconfigure the device and disrupt the service.
   Note that the mechanism by which the configuration change is not a
   factor in this use case: a configuration change may be operated via a
   custom user interface on the SIP device or application, an end-user
   or operator controlled CLI, remote web-based interface.

   Problem statement:
   How does the designer of the XML schema specify access rights for
   each data element and for each level (owner, group, others) in an
   interoperable manner?

   To provide more context to the use case, we compare this problem
   statement with the SNMP or SMI-based model even though, as stated
   above, the problem statement is independent of SNMP.  Clients with an
   SNMP agent store configuration data as instances of the SNMP MIB
   objects.  Changes to such data by authorized network elements is
   accomplished via SNMP through EMS and NMS systems.  Any change is
   authorized by the SNMP agent based on the SMI access control

   definitions (specified by the MAX-ACCESS clause).
   This arrangement is suitable when dynamic configuration changes are
   minimal: the configuration data is stored on the client and the model
   works well when there is a single source of changes.  There are
   examples of MIB modules that have been defined where an object was
   not writable via SNMP but since the object value could be changed
   during runtime or by the end-user: a note was put in the DESCRIPTION
   clause.
   This is illustrated in Figure Z1.

   Figure Z2: Configuration and Management using various protocols

   A separate configuration server (for example, the XCAP Server in the
   above figure) is responsible for the storage and modification of
   data.  This configuration data is accessible by clients and
   authorized network elements alike.

   The importance of access control can be illustrated by many examples:
   assume a data element that is accessible by both the client and a
   network element, but is modifiable only via the network element
   (e.g.: my speed dial list or favorite friends' URI list is modifiable
   via a web-based application talking to the "Network Element").  One
   would expect the XCAP server, the 'keeper' of the data, to enforce
   this access control requirement.  Should this be expressed in the XML
   Schema?

Internet-Draft  SIP Config and Management Considerations   February 2006


   Further, multiple data profiles can be built out of the same set of
   data elements, but with different access control settings.  There may
   also be multiple entity types that share the same access control
   sets.  All this hints at UNIX-like or VACM-like grouping of access
   controls.

   Additionally, the fact that the same XML Schema definitions may call
   for run-time change in access privileges should also be taken into
   consideration.  This may call for the ability to provide access
   control definitions internal or external to the XML data models (for
   example via XPATH).

   In conclusion, as we hope this use case illustrates, the co-authors
   believe there is a need for standardization of Access Control
   directives to enable configuration and management in general, and
   XCAP in particular, to be effectively deployed at wide scale and for
   a wide range of applications.

5.  Use Case 3: Management of clients behind firewalls (and NATs)

   The issues of establishing SIP sessions behind NATs and firewalls
   have been extensively discussed in IETF in SIPPING, BEHAVE, MIDCOM
   and other groups.  We focus on the establishment of a management
   session between a SIP client and a management stationt 'separated by
   a firewall (and NAT) device.  Any command or management operation
   should be initiated by the client.

   Figure Y2: Management operations affected in the presence of
   firewalls (and sometimes NATs depending on the protocol used)

   A management session may be established by the client for an
   undefined period of time (session stays up which could be resource
   intensive).  For efficiency, it should be initiated as needed, based
   on a stimulus from the management host.  For SIP clients, this
   solution may be made possible by using the same signaling mechanisms
   proposed in the SIPPING Configuration framework, for e.g. using the
   SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY framework.  A client could subscribe to

   In conclusion, the use case highlights the needs to define a generic
   mechanism for establishing a client-initiated management connection

   when a SIP session pre-exists.
   The components of such a solution may include:
   - defining how SIP can be used to establish a management session,
   - defining a SIP event package for conveying the relevant management
   session parameters (IP and transport addresses of the management
   station, the type of transport protocol to use for management -
   HTTPS, SNMP over SSH, etc.).

6.  Summary and Next Steps

   In summary, this document presents three use cases for the
   configuration and management of SIP clients or devices using IETF
   protocols.  The proposed approaches lead to following findings and
   suggestions:


   o  An XML data modeling specification for configuration and
      management is required.  The experimental SMI to XML conversion
      methods provide an elegant, short term solution for some actors.
      It leverages the experience and tools for building modules for
      management purposes.  It allow the reuse of some existing data
      models based on SMI with XML based configuration protocols like
      XCAP ([ID-XCAP]).  There have been proposals in the past
      ([IR-SMI-XML]) that have been implemented, and, based on some
      prototyping experimentation, the co-authors of this document
      recommend that this proposal be revisited.

   o  XML-based configuration protocols can greatly benefit from a
      standardized access control definition methodology.  This would
      foster effective deployment of XML based configuration protocols.

   o  Solutions developed in some OPS working groups should address the
      management of clients behind NATs and firewalls, so that IPv4 and
      dual-stack IPv4-IPv6 clients may be managed efficiently.  An
      example specific to SNMP would be to invite proposals to the ISMS
      WG to help address the NAT and firewall traversal within the scope
      of modified transport ([ID-SNMP-SSH]) and security models
      ([ID-SNMP-TMSM]).

   o  The SIP community may benefit from defining solutions to enable
      client-initiated management connection when a SIP session exists.
      A new SIP event package may be used part of the solution
      ([RFC3265]).
