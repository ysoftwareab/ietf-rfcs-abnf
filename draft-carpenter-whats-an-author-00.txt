   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

1.  Introduction and Scope

   The question sometimes comes up of who should be listed as the
   author(s) of a draft, who should be listed as contributors, and what
   acknowledgements are appropriate.  The guidelines below are aimed at
   Internet-Drafts in the IETF publication stream [RFC5741].  They are
   intended to be compatible with the RFC Editor's style guide [RFC7322]
   and with the RFC Editor's authorship policies.

   This draft has been written purely to aid discussion and is not
   expected to be published as an RFC.

2.  Authors

   Authors are people who have made a substantial creative contribution
   to the document.  Normally this means writing text or drawing
   diagrams.  Occasionally, with the consent of the other authors, it
   means making some other substantial creative contribution to the
   document, for example by writing a software implementation as part of
   the design process.

   People who did not make any such substantial contribution should not
   be listed as authors.  In normal circumstances, people should not be
   listed as authors without their explicit permission.

   The practical impact is that the authors will be listed as such on
   the front page if the document becomes an RFC, and in public
   bibliographies.

3.  Contributors

   Contributors are people who made smaller creative contributions to
   the document than the authors.

   People who did not make any such contribution should not be listed as
   contributors.  People should not normally be listed as contributors
   without their explicit permission.

   The dividing line between contributors and authors is a matter of
   judgement and cannot be rigidly defined.  However, the RFC Editor's
   policy is to query any document that has more than five listed
   authors.  Any list of more than five authors will need to be
   negotiated if the document is approved for publication as an RFC.

4.  Editors

   When a document has a large number of contributors and potential
   authors, it may be appropriate to designate one or two people as
   "Editors" and list all the others as contributors.  The editors will
   indeed do the actual work of editing the document on behalf of the
   community.  The practical impact of this is that the editors will be
   listed as such on the front page if the document becomes an RFC, and
   in public bibliographies.

5.  List of Acknowledgements

   Acknowledgements should be given to people who have made significant
   creative contributions smaller than those from the authors and
   contributors, or to people who have made useful comments, provided
   critical reviews, or otherwise contributed significantly to the
   development of the document.  Acknowledgements may also be given to
   people or organizations that have given material support and
   assistance, but this should not include the authors' regular
   employers.

   An acknowledgement does not signify that the person acknowledged
   agrees with the document.  In general, people who do not wish to be
   listed as an author or a contributor, but have in fact made a
   significant contribution, should be given an acknowledgement.

6.  Intellectual Property Rights

   None of the above affects intellectual property rights.  Copyright in
   IETF documents is governed by BCP 78 [RFC5378] and its predecessors,
   the IETF Trust's Legal Provisions, and applicable national and
   international law.

   The word "contributor" used in this draft does not mean the same
   thing as the word "Contributor" used in BCP 79 [RFC3979], which is
   broader.  That BCP should be consulted by anyone concerned about the
   IETF requirement for disclosure of intellectual property rights.

7.  Security Considerations

   None, really.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9.  Acknowledgements

   Valuable comments were received from TBD.
