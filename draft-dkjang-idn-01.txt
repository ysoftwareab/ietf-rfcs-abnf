Abstract

This description addresses the method for using internationalized 
(multilingual) domain names under the current DNS. Further, the method 
for converting a internationalized domain name expressed in a native 
language, into a traditional US-ASCII domain name compatible in current 
DNS, is addressed.

This method especially uses 'sequence of 36 characters' to convert all
characters in IDN into US-ASCII. 

Finally, the way to use this method with lc2LDs are presented.

1. Introduction

Under the current DNS (domain name system), the IP address (which is a 
combination of numbers) and the domain names are used. The purpose of 
the domain name is to use more familiar and memorable names than the IP 
address. Nevertheless, because of the restriction of using only 
US-ASCII characters in domain names, and although some persons don't 
speak English, they have to use unfamiliar English domain names. For 
them, it may not be much different from the IP address.

As a result, it is difficult to find home pages of even famous 
companies without knowing their English domain names in advance. The 
top level domains are designated in English for international 
recognition. As for the second level domain under ccTLD, we have also 
used English letters by using abbreviated English words which almost 
seem to be secret codes (for example, ac, co, go, or, etc.). We have to
write as a 2LD of Seoul Korea '.seoul.kr' instead of Korean. 

Furthermore, in order to control computers and use the Internet with 
voice orders in the future, Internationalized domain names are 
indispensable.

But, In order to be real international, IDN have to be expressed with
English for foreigners who do not know used language.

  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
  "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document 
  are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
  
  A 'internationalized domain name'(IDN) means the domain name expressed 
  in the native language (non-ASCII) in the user's interface.
  
  A 'traditional domain name' means the domain name compatible with the 
  current DNS.
  
  A 'converted domain name' is the same as the traditional domain name 
  but it is converted from an IDN to be compatible with the current DNS.
  
  A 'character substitute' is a 'string of ASCII characters' that 
  replaces a native character in IDN when the IDN is converted into 
  traditional ones.
  
  A 'multilingual key' is a 'character assembly' located at a specific 
  position of the converted domain name and represents that it is the 
  converted domain name from an IDN.
  
  A 'language key' represents the original language from which the 
  domain has been converted into the converted domain names.

  1-2. Summary
  
  According to [RFC1034], domain names must start with a letter (a 
  through z), end with a letter or digit (0 through 9), and have only 
  letters, digits, and hyphen as interior characters in the current DNS. 
   
  Therefore native characters in an IDN must be converted into US-ASCII 
  characters in order to be compatible with the current DNS.

  Hence, 'character substitutes' are made to express native characters 
  (in IDN) with US-ASCII characters. To distinguish converted domain 
  names from traditional ones, a 'multilingual key' is defined and 
  added to every converted domain name. And to represent the original 
  language from which the name has been converted, the 'language key' 
  is assigned for every language.
  
  In this system, when an IDN is converted to the traditional domain 
  name;

  1) The 'multilingual key' will be included automatically in All 
     converted domain names.
  2) The 'language key' will be included automatically in the converted 
     domain name.
  3) All characters will be replaced by 'character substitutes'.
  
  The conversion from an IDN to a traditional name, or the reverse 
  conversion from a converted name to the original IDN, is performed by 
  the conversion program installed on the user's computer. The 
  conversion program will run when the user inputs the domain name 
  including his/her own language and begins to use the internet 
  services. For the display on the monitor, by the multilingual key 
  included in the converted domain name, the program will be run.
  Therefore, users can use all the internet services in their own 
  language at their convenience.
  
  
  
2. Multilingual key

By placing 'a certain specific ASCII characters' in a certain 'specific 
location' in the domain name, a "multilingual key", that represents a 
converted domain name from an IDN, can be made with this 'specific 
characters in the specific location'. When a domain includes this 
'multilingual key' at the specific location, the 'multilingual key' 
indicates that the domain name was converted from IDN.

When a user inputs a IDN that includes his/her native language in order
to log in, the system adds this multilingual key with a language key 
first and converts it into a traditional domain name. 

For display, the system checks whether the multilingual key is 
contained. If so, according to the language key, the system converts 
that domain name to an IDN.

Note. To avoid confusion, the multilingual key should be characters 
that is not commonly used. Further, it is recommended that the domain 
name, containing the same character(s) in the same location, not be 
registered as the traditional domain name.

In section 9. below, this multilingual key is replaced by a new gTLD.



3. Language key

One or two US-ASCII characters are assigned as a 'language key' for 
every language currently defined (and being added) by [ISO 10646]. 
This language key follows the 'multilingual key' in the converted 
domain names and represents the kind of language from which the name 
has been converted.

Internet Draft       IDN divided by characters key       August 8, 2000


By separating domains according to language, multilingual characters 
can be expressed in minimum numbers of ASCII characters. 

If the language key is not for the language that user have selected as 
his main or subsidiary language, but for other languages, the system 
shall not convert and display it to the monitor as US-ASCII characters.

As a language key, if two ASCII characters are given for every language
(like 'ko' for Korean, 'ja' for Japanese), we can manage 1,296 languages 
(=36x36) theoretically.

In section 9. below, this language key is replaced by lc2LD.



4. Sequence of 36 characters 

In order to substitute all characters (used in IDNs) by the least 
number of US-ASCII when the IDNs are converted into traditional names, 
the 'sequence of 36 characters' is made with letters (a-z) and digits 
(0-9). They 36 characters may be used in the middle or at the end of 
the domain name. 



5. Composition of Character substitute

Character substitute consists of the following:
a. Separate characters currently defined (and being added) by 
   [ISO10646] according to the kind of language.
b. For each language, all of native characters as well as alphabets and 
   digits are arranged in the 'sequence of 36 characters'.
c. Set the arranged 'sequence of 36 characters' as the 'character 
   substitute' for the character.


According to the entire numbers of characters of one language, assign 
all characters to 'sequence of 36 characters' as follows:


  5.1. In case the number of characters is below 36; 


    5.1.1. When the number of characters is below 9;

      5.1.1.1. Assign multilingual characters 1-9, and digits (0-9) to 
      00-09 of the 'sequence of 36 characters'. The alphabets 
      (US-ASCII, a-z) and hyphen are used as they are.

      5.1.1.2. As an alternative to 5.1.1.1. this arrangement may be 
               used:
      Assign multilingual characters to the 01-09 of the 'sequence of

      36 characters' and the digit '0 (zero)' to '00'. digits (1-9) 
      and the alphabets (US-ASCII) and hyphen are used as they are.


      (Example)

      In German there are 4 characters which are distinguished from 
      english alphabets (a-z) case-insensitively.
      Because those 4 can be managed as multilingual characters, 
      German characters correspond to this case 5.1.1. Therefore those
      4 characters assigned to 01-04 of the `sequence of 36characters'.
 
      But in this case It seems better to assign them to '0a' '0o' 0u' 
      0b' (as if section 5.1.2.2) instead of 01-04.
      And assign the digit '0(zero)' to '00', 
      The rest of digits (1-9) and the alphabets (a-z) and hyphen are 
      used as they are. 


      German domain name under gTLD (.com), 
      (in hexadecimal) "0x0067/0x0072/0x00fc/0x006e/.com", will be 
      converted following.


        <Assumption> 
    
        The multilingual key is 'z-' at the position of name part, 
        and the language key for German is 'de'. 
    
        <Character substitute> 
      
        German character(u-umlaut)
              0x00fc===> 0u  
        3 alphabets are used as they are.
              0x0067===> g
              0x0072===> r
              0x006e===> n 

        <Conversion>

        The name of IDN in German under user interface,
        "0x0067/0x0072/0x00fc/0x006e/.com", is converted to the 
        traditional name following.

        (1) The multilingual key 'z-' is added to name part first.
        (2) The language key 'de' follows The multilingual key.
        (3) Character substitutes and '.com' follow them.

    5.1.2. When the number of characters is above 9 and below 26;

      5.1.2.1. Assign multilingual characters to a-z, and the alphabets 
      (US-ASCII) to 0a-0z, digit '0' to 00 and rests of digits (1-9) and 
      hyphen are used as they are. 

      5.1.2.2. As an alternative to 5.1.2.1 this arrangement may be 
               used;
      Assign multilingual characters to 0a-0z, digit '0' to 00 and

      as it is.

      5.1.3.2. As an alternative to 5.1.3.1 this arrangement may be 
               used;
      Assign multilingual characters to 01-0z, digit '0' to 00 and

      Assign multilingual characters to 10-zz (35x36=1260) of the 
      'sequence of 36 characters' in order. 

      Assign digits (0-9) and alphabets (a-z) to 00-0z of the 'sequence 
      of 36 characters'. Hyphen is used as it is.

      5.2.2. When the number of characters is above 1260 characters and
             below 1296 characters;

      By attaching the letters using a hyphen from '-0' to '-z' to the
      end of the sequence of 'zz', the representation range of two 
      ASCII characters is extended to 1296 multilingual characters.
      In this case hyphen is assigned to '0-'.

      5.2.3. When the number of characters is above 1296 characters and 
             below 45,360 characters;

      Assign digits (0-9) and alphabets (a-z) to 00-0z of the 'sequence 
      of 36 characters'. A hyphen is used as it is.
      
      Assign multilingual characters to the three digits of '36 
      characters sequence', 100-zzz, in order.

      (Example) 
    
      In Korea, they use Korean characters together with chinese 
      characters in writing. In other words, for Korean, multilingual 
      characters are composed of Korean characters (11,172) and Chinese 
      characters (about 21,000).

      The language of around 32,000 characters corresponds to this 
      section 5.2.3.
    
      So digits (0-9) and alphabets (a-z) are assigned to 00-09 and 
      0a-0z of the 36-characters sequence. 
      And the 11,172 Korean characters at position 0xac00-d7a3

  7.1. Converting IDN into traditional name.

  When a user enters an IDN into an application to use an Internet 
  service, the conversion program runs by multilingual character(s) 
  included in the name. Then, the program converts the IDN into the 
  traditional name by including the 'multilingual key' and the 
  'language key' mentioned above, and by replacing each character with 
  its 'character substitute', and hands over the converted domain name 
  to the application handling the Internet service.

 
  7.2 Display of IDN

  When a domain name includes the multilingual key, and the language 
  key in that name conforms to the language selected as main or 
  subsidiary language, the program converts, (reverse of 7.1), by 
  deleting the multilingual key and language key, and by replacing the 
  rest of the ASCII characters with native characters. And then the 
  IDN is displayed to users monitor in the native language.
 
  But if the domain name does not contain a multilingual key, or the 
  language key does not conform to the language selected, the domain 
  name is displayed to the monitor as it is US-ASCII without any 
  conversion. In other words, traditional US-ASCII names and foreign 
  IDNs are displayed in English, and the IDNs that belongs to user's 
  native language are displayed in User's language.  
  
  
  
8. Foreign language

When a user logs in another IDN in a different language zone, 
(e.g., Japanese user tries to log in the Korean domain);

If the user does not have a text editor for its language, he/she types 
and logs in the domain name as it is US-ASCII.


9. creating lc2LD for IDN

1) creating lc2LDs under current gTLDs

Two key, that is multilingual key  and language key, can be replaced by 
one lc2LD (language code 2nd Level Domain), like .ko.com for korean 
under '.com', '.ja.net' for japanese under .net.

Then,  the examples above will be encoded to;

0x0067/0x0072/0x00fc/0x006e/.com in section 5.1.1.2.
     ===>'gr0un.de.com' instead of 'z-degr0un.com'
      
'0xb300/0xd55c/0xbbfc/0xad5d/.0xd68c/0xc0ac/' in section 5.2.3.
     ===>'2ds96445y1a5.ko.com' instead of 'z-kr2ds96445y1a5.com'.

2) When it is impossible for every language to find suitable strings of 
characters under current gTLDs, And if new gTLDs Only for IDN, such as 
'.icom' (or .ico), 'inet' (or .ine), can be created, then new gTLDs will
replace the 'multilingual key'.

In this case the examples above will be encoded to;

0x0067/0x0072/0x00fc/0x006e/.com in section 5.1.1.2.
     ===>'degr0un.icom' instead of 'z-degr0un.com'
      
'0xb300/0xd55c/0xbbfc/0xad5d/.0xd68c/0xc0ac/' in section 5.2.3.
     ===>'kr2ds96445y1a5.icom' instead of 'z-kr2ds96445y1a5.com'.

3) lc2LD under new gTLD

The lc2LDs under new gTLDs can replace language key. Then the examples 
will be encoded respectively to 'gr0un.de.icom'
and '2ds96445y1a5.kr.icom'
