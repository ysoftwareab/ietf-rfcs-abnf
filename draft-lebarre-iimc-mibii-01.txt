            Draft      Translation of Internet MIB-II (RFC1213)  3/26/93



            1.Introduction

            The past decade has witnessed the development of enterprise
            wide networks composed of a multi-vendor environment
            containing heterogeneous protocol and hardware suites.
            Organizations have become increasingly dependent on these
            enterprise networks for their daily operations.  This
            dependence has focused attention on the need for operation,
            administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) of the
            multi-vendor enterprise network on an end-to-end basis.

            1.1 Background

            This document is part of a package of ISO/CCITT and Internet
            Management Coexistence (IIMC) drafts.  Other documents
            included in this package are:

            [IIMCIMIBTRANS]     Translation of Internet MIBs to
                                ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs

            [IIMCOMIBTRANS]     Translation of ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs to
                                Internet MIBs

            [IIMCSEC]           ISO/CCITT to Internet Management
                                Security

            [IIMCPROXY]         ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Proxy

            These documents together comprise a package aimed at
            integrating ISO/CCITT-based and Internet-based management
            systems.  These documents represent coexistence and
            interworking efforts underway within the IIMC working group,
            chartered under the auspices of the Network Management Forum
            Architecture Integration ISO/Internet technical team.

            This work was initiated, in part, by NM Forum efforts to
            translate RFC 1214 for use with OMNIPoint 1 implementations.
            Through this effort, it became obvious that end-to-end
            management requires an integrated, unified view of the
            managed network, despite differences in management protocol
            and information structure.  Integrated management can be
            facilitated by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent service, protocol,
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.  MIB
            translation procedures can be used to support proxy
            management, as well as to take advantage of existing MIB
            definition and avoid duplication of effort. In this way,
            commercial investment in both ISO/CCITT and Internet-based
            management technologies can be preserved through deployment
            of common methods and tools which support integration.

            This overall strategy was outlined in a joint publication
            developed by the NM Forum and X/Open entitled "ISO/CCITT and

            Draft      Translation of Internet MIB-II (RFC1213)  3/26/93


            Internet Management: Coexistence and Interworking Strategy"
            [NMFMC92].  The documents included in the IIMC package are
            the next level of detailed specifications which implement
            several of the methodologies identified in the strategy.

            1.2 Overview

            The response to the need for OAM&P of enterprise networks
            has been the development of network management standards
            within various networking communities - most notably the
            ISO/CCITT and Internet communities. However, coordination of
            standards activities between these two communities has not
            occurred.  As a result, although they share a nearly common
            management model, differences in their management protocols
            and structures of management information (SMIs) have
            developed due to differing management philosophies.

            The ISO/CCITT community has developed the Common Management
            Information Protocol (CMIP) [ISO9596-1], and related SMI
            documents [ISO10165-1,2,4].  The Internet community has
            developed the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
            [RFC1157], and its successor, SNMPv2 [SNMPv2PROT]. The
            Internet SMI is defined in [RFC1155] and [SNMPv2SMI].
            Although functionally similar, the Internet and ISO/CCITT
            protocols and SMIs differ in terms of their complexity and
            specific operations.

            The focus on the need for end-to-end enterprise management
            has indicated the need to integrate the management of
            components accessed by ISO/CCITT management, Internet
            management and proprietary management mechanisms in a manner
            which presents a unified view of the network, despite
            protocol and SMI differences.  One way to integrate
            management is by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent services, protocol
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.

            A body of telecommunications and computer vendors,
            represented by organizations such as the Network Management
            Forum (NMF), and the U.S. government, as specified in the
            Government Network Management Profile (GNMP) have based
            their integrated management model on the ISO/CCITT
            management model using CMIP and the ISO/CCITT SMI.  These
            organizations are particularly interested in the development
            of proxies for devices that use the Internet management
            protocols and SMI.  Their interest is primarily due to the
            widespread commercial implementation and use of such devices
            within their enterprises, especially devices that use the
            Internet TCP/IP protocol suite.

            The proxy architecture provides emulation of CMIS services
            by mapping to the corresponding SNMP message(s) necessary to
            carry out the service request.  The service emulation allows
            management of Internet objects by an ISO/CCITT manager.  The
            left hand side of the proxy behaves like an ISO/CCITT agent,
            communicating with the ISO/CCITT manager using CMIP
            protocols.  The right hand side  of the proxy behaves like
            an Internet manager, communicating with the Internet agent
            using SNMP protocols.

            The proxy relies on the existence of a pair of directly-
            related MIB definitions, where the Internet MIB has been
            translated into ISO/CCITT GDMO using the procedures
            specified in [IIMCIMIBTRANS]. The proxy defined in
            [IIMCPROXY] uses these MIB definitions and rules to provide
            run-time translation of management information carried in
            service requests and responses.

            The proxy architecture is designed with a specified
            interface between the proxy and the underlying protocol
            stacks, and so deals primarily in terms of CMIS services and
            SNMP "services".  The proxy emulates services such as CMIS
            scoping and filtering, processing of CMIS operations, and
            forwarding/logging of CMIS notifications by performing a
            mapping process which must be tailored for each protocol
            (for example, SNMP and SNMPv2 are variants of the same
            protocol mapping process).

            In addition, [IIMCOMIBTRANS] specifies translation
            procedures for converting ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs into Internet
            MIBs.  MIBs generated by this translation process cannot be
            utilized by the Proxy defined in [IIMCPROXY], although
            another kind of Proxy could be defined for this purpose in
            the future.

            Finally, note that MIBs translated by procedures such as
            those defined by [IIMCIMIBTRANS] and [IIMCOMIBTRANS] may
            also be used without a proxy. For example, a translated MIB
            may be used to take advantage of existing MIB definitions
            when business needs require deployment in a different
            management environment. Translated MIBs may also be used to
            provide uniformity when multiple management environments are
            supported by a single system (e.g., dual stack managers).

            A major reason for the rapid commercialization of devices

            Draft      Translation of Internet MIB-II (RFC1213)  3/26/93


            manageable via the Internet management protocol is due to
            the speed with which the vendors in the Internet community
            have been able to develop MIBs based on the Internet SMI.
            To capitalize on this continuing Internet MIB development
            and their deployment in commercial devices, communities
            interested in integrated management via CMIP/SNMP proxies,
            and communities interested in using CMIP agents to manage
            TCP/IP resources, require the translation of Internet MIBs
            defined according to the Internet Structure of Management
            Information (SMI) [RFC1155] [SNMPv2SMI] into MIBs defined
            according to the ISO SMI [ISO 10164-1]and Guidelines for the
            Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO) [ISO 10165-4].
            Procedures for such translations are described in
            [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            This document applies the procedures described in
            [IIMCIMIBTRANS]to the translation and registration of the
            Internet MIB-II as defined in[RFC1213], and to the IP
            Forwarding Table defined in [RFC1354].

            This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
            ISO/CCITT SMI and  terminology as well as the Internet to
            SMI translation defined in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            This document is allocated the following registration
            identifier for purposes of referencing material contained

            2. Object Class Definitions

            The Internet MIB-II objects [RFC1213] are recast into
            ISO/CCITT GDMO templates as defined in [ISO10165-4], and
            registered, using the procedures defined in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            Registration of IIMC objects is accomplished by
            concatenating the sub-identifiers that compose the OID used
            to register an internet entity,<internetEntityId>, with a
            new registration arc allocated for IIMC translation
            registration.  The OID is of the following form:

                 IIMC OID = {<iimcAutoTrans> <internetEntityId>}

            The templates for the IIMC MIB-II object classes are listed

                      to  a route for which the next hop is the final

                      Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has
                      the  effect  of  invalidating the corresponding

                      implementation-specific matter  as  to
                      whether the agent removes an invalidated
                      entry from the table.  Accordingly,

                      receive tabular information from agents that

            4. The Containment Hierarchy

            Name Binding templates that define the containment hierarchy
            for the ISO/CCITT MIB-II managed object classes are listed.
            A proxy implementation would have multiple instances of the
            ISO/CCITT system managed object, one for each Internet
            agent, and one for the proxy itself.

            The object identifier {iimcManagementNB} is defined in
            [IIMCIMIBTRANS].  Also defined in that document is the
            convention for creating OIDs for name bindings:


            4.1 Name Bindings

            A Naming Tree diagram for IIMC MIB-II managed object classes
            is illustrated below.
