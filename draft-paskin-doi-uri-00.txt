Abstract

This document defines the "doi" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
scheme for Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). The DOI system was 
developed by the International DOI Foundation (http://www.doi.org), 
an open membership-based organization founded to develop a framework 
of infrastructure, policies and procedures to support the identification 
needs of providers of intellectual property. DOI identifiers are 
persistent across time and unique across network space. The "doi" URI 
scheme allows a DOI to be referenced by a URI for Internet applications.

The key words "MUST", "MAY", and "SHOULD" used in this document are to 
be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. Compliant software MUST 
follow this specification.

1. Introduction

DOI stands for Digital Object Identifier [DOI], which is a managed 
identifier of an intellectual property entity across a common business 
sector. The DOI identifier enables the network retrieval of a set of 
related services. The DOI identifier is not constrained to a network 
application context. DOI identifiers have been widely deployed by the 
publishing industry. This specification defines the "doi" URI scheme 
for DOI identifiers referenced within Internet applications.

DOI identifiers are globally unique across the URI namespace and 
persistent over time. A DOI identifier can "be used as a reference to 
a resource well beyond the lifetime of the resource it identifies or 
of any naming authority involved in the assignment of its name" [RFC1737].
A "doi" URI has associated data related to the entity that the DOI 
identifies. 

The "doi" URI scheme defines a standard way to represent a DOI identifier
under URI namespace. A "doi" URI may serve as a pure name or may be 
de-referenced by a network service. When used as a name, a "doi"-based 
URI is independent of any service protocol and accordingly, is not 
network de-referenceable. When used within a network reference (e.g. 
within a hyperlink), a DOI identifier does not have a native resolution 
system. It is instead transported using a network protocol to a specific
service (e.g. the Handle System [HS], or a HTTP request to a proxy). 
Such service requests may also include supplemental query components 
specific to that service.

DOIs must be registered through an appointed registration agency. The 
International DOI Foundation, which is the maintenance agency for the DOI,
is responsible for the appointment of registration agencies.

The "doi" URI scheme defined in this document conforms to the generic URI
syntax as specified in RFC2396 [RFC2396]. UTF-8 [UTF-8] encoding is 
mandated for any DOI transmitted between "doi" user agent and any DOI 
service. Syntax for DOI identifier within the "doi" scheme is defined in 
accordance with ANSI/NISO Z39.84 [NISO39.84] standard for Digital Object 
Identifier Syntax.

2. The ôdoiö URI Scheme 

2.1.  ôdoiö Scheme Definition

    doi                 = scheme ":" doi-identifier

    scheme              = "doi"

    doi-identifier      = prefix "/" suffix

    prefix              = chars-no-slash

    suffix              = chars

    chars-no-slash      = 1*(%x00-2E  /  %x30-FF)
                        ; any character of the UCS [ISO10646] of U+00A0
                        ; and beyond, except the '/' character.

    chars               = 1*(%x00-FF)
                        ; any character of the UCS [ISO10646] of U+00A0
                        ; and beyond.

The prefix is always assigned to a registrant by a registration agency. 
The registrant is responsible for the creation of a valid suffix. The 
prefix corresponds to the creator naming authority at the time of 
construction only. The administration of any particular DOI may be 
transferred to another party at any time, so the prefix does not denote 
the administrative ownership of a particular DOI.

NISO Z39.84 is the authoritative reference that specifies the rules for
 constructing a DOI. Once constructed, a DOI is to be interpreted as an 
opaque identifier. The minimum constraints for validation of a DOI string
 are that the prefix and suffix components be non-empty.

2.2. Reserved and Excluded Characters under "doi" scheme

The "doi" syntax abide by the same set of excluded US-ASCII characters as
 specified in RFC2396. It further reserves the following characters that 
are used in common service requests that may be used to append information
 to a DOI in certain circumstances (e.g. adding parameters resolution 
instructions to a HTTP URL encoded service request):

     reserved = "?" | "&" | "=" | "#"

If the data for a "doi-identifier" component would conflict with the 
reserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped before forming 
the URI. Details of the escape encoding can be found in RFC2396, section 
2.4.

2.3. Examples of "doi" URIs

Some examples of syntactically valid "doi" URIs are given below:

     (a) doi:alpha-beta/182.342-24

where "alpha-beta" is the prefix and "182.342-24" is the suffix

     (b) doi:10.abc/ab/cd/ef

where "10.abc" is the prefix and "ab/cd/ef" is the suffix 

     (c) doi:1.23/2002/january/21/4690

where "1.23" is the prefix and "january/21/4690" is the suffix

     (d) <element xmlns="doi:1.23/2002/january/21/4690">

The acquisition of DOI services can be achieved through the use other 
protocols as a proxy to transfer to dedicated networked service components.
 Examples of such use are given below:

     (e) http://my.resolver.inc/resolve?id=doi%3Aalpha-beta%2Fmsws

is an OpenURL [NISO Z39.??] service request for "doi:alpha-beta/msws"

     (f) rtsp://service.net/query?doi%3A10.abc%2Fab%2Fcd%2Fef

is a service request for "doi:10.abc/ab/cd/ef"

3. Security Considerations

The "doi" URI scheme is subject to the same security implications as the
general URI scheme described in [RFC 2396].

When DOI values are used in resolution services, retrieval of DOI data 
will be subject to the security considerations of the underlying protocol
used to access the DOI service.

4. Further Information

The current DOI system utilizes the Handle System [HS] for its identifier
resolution and administration. Information regarding the Handle System 
can be found under http://www.handle.net/.
