             draft-purkayastha-multicast-http-using-bier-00

Abstract

   HTTP Level multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-use-cases].  In order to enable the use case, the
   document describes additional functions in the ingress and egress
   nodes to the BIER network.  These functions are assumed to be part of
   the BIER multicast overlay.

1.  Introduction

   BIER Use Cases document [I-D.ietf-bier-use-cases] describes an "HTTP
   Level Multicast" scenario, where HTTP-level clients benefit from the
   dynamic multicast group formation enabled by BIER.  HTTP multicast
   means aggregating individual HTTP Responses (e.g. for the same
   segment of a viral video) and mapping it onto the BIER multicast
   overlay.  For this, the server NAP (network attachment point),
   creates a list of outstanding client NAP requests to the same HTTP
   request URI.  When a response is available, BIER forwarding
   information is retrieved and used to send the HTTP response.

   In this draft, we introduce the requirements for a BIER multicast
   overlay realizing this use case.  It also describes the necessary
   functions that form the BIER multicast overlay and the operations
   that enable the desired "HTTP Level Multicast" behavior.  We describe
   a list of protocol changes needed for the realization of the
   individual operations.

2.  Requirements

   A realization for the "HTTP multicast" use case may have the
   following requirements:

   o  MUST support multiple FQDN-based service endpoints to exist in the
      overlay

   o  MUST send FQDN-based service requests at the network level to a
      suitable FQDN-based service endpoint via policy-based selection of
      appropriate path information

   o  MUST allow for multicast delivery of HTTP response to same HTTP
      request URI

   o  MUST provide direct path mobility, where the path between the
      egress and ingress NAPs can be determined as being optimal (e.g.,
      shortest path or direct path to a selected instance), is needed to
      avoid the use of anchor points and further reduce service-level
      latency

3.  HTTP Multicast Overlay Components

   Let us formulate the architecture of the BIER multicast overlay for
   the scenario outlined in [I-D.ietf-bier-use-cases].  This overlay is
   shown in Figure 1 below.

   The multicast overlay is formed by the BFIR and BFER of the BIER
   layer and the additional NAP and PCE elements shown in the figure.
   When connecting to a standard IP routed peering network, a special
   NAP is utilized, shown as the border GW in the figure.

4.  HTTP Multicast Overlay Operations

   As shown in Figure 1, the multicast overlay includes a function
   called PCE (Path Computation Element function), which is responsible
   for selecting the correct multicast end point and possibly realizing
   path policy enforcement.  The result of the selection is a BIER path
   identifier, which is delivered to the NAP upon initial path
   computation request (i.e., when sending a request to or response for
   a specific URL for the first time).  The path identifier is utilized
   for any future request for a given URL-based request.  All service
   end points indicate availability to the PCE through a registration
   procedure, the PCE will instruct all NAPs to invalidate previous path
   identifiers to the specific URL.  This may result in an initial path
   computation request at the next service request forwarding.  Through
   this, the newly registered service endpoint might be utilized if the
   policy-governed path computation selects said service instance.

   In the architecture of Figure 1, an HTTP request is sent by an IP-
   based device towards the FQDN of the server defined in the HTTP
   request.

   At the client facing NAP, the HTTP request is terminated at the HTTP
   level at a local HTTP proxy.  We assume termination on the client
   side at Layer 3 and above protocols, such as TCP.  Server NAP at the
   egress, terminates any transport protocol on the outgoing (server)
   side.  These terminating functions are assumed to be part of the
   client/server NAP.

   If no local BIER forwarding information exists to the server (NAP), a
   path computation entity (PCE) is consulted, which calculates a
   unicast path from the BFIR to which the client NAP is connect to the
   BFER to which the server NAP is connected.  The PCE provides the
   forwarding information to the client NAP, which in turn caches the
   result.

   Ultimately, the HTTP request is forwarded by the client NAP towards
   the server-facing NAP via the local BFIR.  We assume a (TCP-friendly)
   transport protocol being used for the transmission between client and
   server NAP while not mandating the use of TCP for this transmission.

   Upon arrival of an HTTP request at the server NAP, the server NAP
   proxy forwards the HTTP request as a well-formed HTTP request locally
   to the server.

   If no BIER forwarding information exists for the reverse direction
   towards the requesting client NAP, this information is requested from
   the PCE, similar to the operation in forward direction.

   Upon arrival of any further client NAP request at the server NAP to
   an HTTP request whose response is still outstanding, the client NAP
   is added to an internal request table.  Optionally, the request is
   suppressed from being sent to the server.

   Upon arrival of an HTTP response at the server NAP, the server NAP
   consults its internal request table for any outstanding HTTP requests
   to the same request.  The server NAP retrieves the stored BIER
   forwarding information for the reverse direction for all outstanding
   HTTP requests and determines the path information to all client NAPs
   through a binary OR over all BIER forwarding identifiers with the
   same SI field.  This newly formed joint BIER multicast response
   identifier is used to send the HTTP response across the network.

5.  Required Protocol Changes

   For the operations outlined in the previous section, we foresee the
   following protocol changes may be required:

   o  NAP-to-NAP protocol for HTTP: Map HTTP to BIER message exchange
      between client and server NAPs

   o  NAP-PCE protocol: Used for path computation and delivery of BIER
      routing information as well as path updates

   o  Overlay transport protocol: Used for transport-level exchange over
      BIER layer

   o  Registration protocol: Used to register FQDN service endpoints

   o  Content certificate distribution protocol: Used for HTTPS support

   There is a similar ongoing work in SFC WG, which handles HTTP
   redirection [I-D.purkayastha-sfc-service-indirection].  The lower
   layers for the NAPs and PCE infrastructure is similar between the two
   approaches.  Does the WG see value in supporting the requirements for
   BIER to enable HTTP Multicast Use case as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-use-cases]?  It also raises a relevant question, where
   shall the protocol work be done?

6.  IANA Considerations
