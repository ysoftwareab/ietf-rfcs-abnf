Abstract

   This	document is a draft of a revision to RFC 1632: A Revised Catalog
   of Available	X.500 Implementations and is based on the results of
   data	collection via a WWW home page that enabled implementors to
   submit new or updated descriptions of currently available
   implementations of X.500, including commercial  products and	openly
   available offerings.	RFC 1632 is a revision of RFC 1292.  We
   contacted each contributor to RFC 1632 to request an	update and
   published the URL of	the WWW	home page survey template in several
   mailing lists to encourage the submission of	new product
   descriptions.

   This	document contains detailed description of TBD X.500
   implementations - DSAs, DUAs, and DUA interfaces.

1.  Introduction

   This	document catalogs currently available implementations of X.500,
   including commercial	products and openly available offerings.  For
   the purposes	of this	survey,	we classify X.500 products as,


      DSA

	 A DSA is an OSI application process that provides the Directory
	 functionality,

      DUA

	 A DUA is an OSI application process that represents a user in
	 accessing the Directory and uses the DAP to communicate with a
	 DSA, and

      DUA Interface

	 A DUA Interface is an application process that	represents a
	 user in accessing the Directory using either DAP but supporting
	 only a	subset of the DAP functionality	or a protocol different
	 from DAP to communicate with a	DSA or DUA.

   Section 2 of	this document contains a listing of implementations
   cross referenced by keyword.	 This list should aid in identifying
   implementations that	meet your criteria.

   To compile this catalog, the	IDS Working Group solicited input from
   the X.500 community by publishing a URL for a set of	on-line
   description forms deployed on the WWW as a home page	on an InterNIC
   server. This	URL
   (http://www.internic.net/projects/x500catalog/catalogtop.html) was
   advertised on the following directory-related mailing lists:
   iso@nic.ddn.mil, isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,
   ids@merit.edu, ietf-asid@umich.edu, mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com,
   nadf-l@ema.org, and dssig@nist.gov.

   Readers are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the	forms
   and content	of  this  memo.	 New submissions are welcome.  Please
   direct input	to  the	 Integrated  Directory	Services  (IDS)	Working
   Group (ietf-ids@umich.edu)  or  to  the authors.  IDS will produce
   new versions	of this	document when a	significant number of
   substantive comments	have been received or when significant updates
   and/or modifications	to X.500-related standards documents have been

   ratified.  This will	be determined by the IDS chairpersons.

1.1  Purpose

   The Internet	has experienced	a steady growth	in X.500 piloting
   activities.	This document hopes to provide an easily accessible
   source of information on X.500 implementations for those who	wish to
   consider X.500 technology for deploying a Directory service.

1.2  Scope

   This	document contains descriptions of both free and	commercial X.500
   implementations.  It	does not provide instructions on how to	install,
   run,	or manage these	implementations.  The descriptions and indices
   are provided	to make	the readers aware of available options and thus
   enable more informed	choices.

1.3 Disclaimer

   Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and	vendors,
   and not by the editors. We worked with the description authors to
   ensure uniformity and readability, but cannot guarantee the accuracy
   or completeness of the descriptions,	nor the	stability of the
   implementations.

1.4  Overview

   Section 1 contains introductory information.

   Section 2 contains a	list of	keywords, their	definitions, a cross
   reference of	the X.500 implementations by these keywords and	a table
   containing implementor name,	implementor abreviation, and the page of
   this	document on which the description begins for a particular
   implementor.

   Section 3 contains the X.500	implementation descriptions.

   Section 4 has a list	of references.

   Section 6 lists the editors'	addresses.

1.5  Acknowledgments

   The creation	of this	catalog	would not have been possible without the
   efforts of the description authors and the members of the IDS Working
   Group.  Our special thanks to the editors of	RFC 1632, Linda

   Millington and Sri Sataluri who graciously contributed the nroff
   source file used to structure their version of the catalog.

2.  Keywords

   Keywords are	abbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.
   The list of keywords	defined	below was derived from the
   implementation descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed
   by a	keyword	either as a result of: (1) explicit, not implied,
   reference to	a particular capability	in the implementation
   description text, or	(2) input from the implementation description
   author(s).

2.1  Keyword Definitions

   This	section	contains keyword definitions.  They have been organized
   and grouped by functional category.	The definitions	are ordered
   first alphabetically	by keyword category, and second	alphabetically
   by implementation name within keyword category.

INTERNET-DRAFT	ISODE Consortium Release 3.0 X.500(1993) 21 January 1996


NAME

   ISODE Consortium Release 3.0	X.500(1993) Directory
   ISODE Consortium Ltd.

ABSTRACT

   This	implementation is a source release of an X.500(1993) Directory
   System Agent	(DSA).	It has been designed an	implemented as an X.500
   1993	DSA  not as a 1988 DSA with '93	extensions.  Emphasis has been
   placed on providing support for a flexible information model, access
   control, X.509 security features, and standard replication.

   The 1993 DSA	offers a strong	technical foundation on	which to build
   an information and messaging	infrastructure that relies on robust and
   scalable directory services.	 The implementation of this DSA
   incorporates	the experience gained through the development, support,
   and maintenance of the earlier QUIPU, as well as operational
   experience and standards support.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   The DSA is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory
   Implementors	Guide Version 1. X.500(1993) features such as
   replication,	access control,	as well	as X.509 certification are also
   available.  Interoperability	testing	with other DSAs	has been
   performed.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   Please contact the ISODE Consortium if you wish to obtain our
   protocol information	conformance statements.	PICS may also be
   available from member organizations for their binary	products.

INTERNET-DRAFT	ISODE Consortium Release 3.0 X.500(1993) 21 January 1996


INTEROPERABILITY

   Interoperability with several other DSAs has	been demonstrated in
   pilot operation and at Eurosinet in October 1995.

   At Eurosinet, X.500 interoperability	testing	used the X.500 DAP
   (Directory Access) and DSP (Directory System) protocols. Successful
   testing was done between the	ISODE Consortium X.500(1993) DSA and
   DSAs	from four other	vendors	including Siemens-Nixdorf and Bull. The
   ISODE Consortium was	the only vendor	to bring an X.500(93) compliant
   DSA to the workshop for the scheduled X.500(93) testing.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Connectivity	to the global research pilots (PARADISE	etc.) has been
   demonstrated. It is expected	that this system will be used
   extensively in a wide range of pilot	activities.  DUA Connectivity,
   and DSA Connectivity.

BUGS

   Bugs	should be reported to the ISODE	Consortium via email.

CAVEATS	AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

   The IC R3.0 release is application level code, and assumes vendor
   provided lower layers. It provides the following modules with support
   for a range of APIs to handle associated lower layers:


	 * RFC 1006 (vendor supplied TCP/IP using sockets or TLI)

	 * Transport service (vendor supplied transport, which may be
	   any class and use any network service. TLI, XTI and various
	   vendor-specific APIs).

	 * TP0 (Vendor supplied	X.25 or	CONS using NTI and various
	   vendor specific APIs).

INTERNET-DRAFT			  LDAP			 21 January 1996


NAME

   LDAP

   University of Michigan

ABSTRACT

   UM-LDAP is an implementation	of the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol. LDAP is a draft Internet standard directory service
   protocol that runs over TCP/IP. It can be used to provide a stand-
   alone directory service, or to provide lightweight access to	the
   X.500 directory.  LDAP is defined by	RFC 1777 and RFC 1778.

   The UM-LDAP package includes	the following components:

	 - slapd - a stand-alone LDAP directory	server

	 - slurpd - a stand-alone LDAP replication server

	 - ldapd - an LDAP-to-X.500 gateway server

	 - centipede - an LDAP centroid	generation and maintenance
	   program

	 - libldap - an	LDAP client library

	 - liblber - a lightweight BER/DER encoding/decoding library

	 - ldif	tools -	data conversion	tools for use with slapd

	 - in.xfingerd - a finger-to-LDAP gateway server

	 - go500 - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching

	 - go500gw - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching and
	   browsing

	 - rcpt500 - an	email-to-LDAP query responder

	 - mail500 - an	LDAP-capable mailer

	 - fax500 - an LDAP-capable mailer that	supports remote	printing

	 - LDAP	tools -	A collection of	shell-based LDAP utility
	   programs




Apple, Rossen						       [Page 54]

INTERNET-DRAFT			  LDAP			 21 January 1996


   In addition,	there are some contributed components:


	 - web500 - an HTTP-to-LDAP gateway

	 - whois++d - a	WHOIS++-to-LDAP	gateway

	 - saucer - a simple command-line oriented client program

   The latest information about	LDAP can always	be found on the	LDAP
   Home	Page at	this URL:

      http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   The U-M LDAP	distribution is	a complete implementation of the LDAP
   protocol.  The LDAP protocol	does not support access	to all X.500
   features and	operations.  The operations supported are bind,	search,
   compare, add, delete, modify, modify	RDN, and abandon.  Note	that
   read	and list operations can	be emulated using the search operation.
   Size	and time limits	may be specified, as may alias dereferencing and
   searching, but all X.500 service controls are not supported.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   Since the LDAP protocol itself has not yet been updated to support
   any 1993-specific X.500 features, this implementation does support
   any 1993 features yet either.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   Believed to be compliant with:

      RFC-1274:	"The COSINE and	Internet X.500 Schema"
      RFC-1777:	"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"
      RFC-1778:	"The String Representation of Standard Attribute
      Syntaxes"
      RFC-1779:	"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"
      RFC-1781:	"Using the OSI Directory to Achieve User Friendly
      Naming"

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL	RFCs

   Includes an implementation of the LDAP API, as defined in RFC-1823.
   Search filters used within UM-LDAP comply with RFC-1558: "A String




Apple, Rossen						       [Page 55]

INTERNET-DRAFT			  LDAP			 21 January 1996


   Representation of LDAP Search Filters."

INTEROPERABILITY

   The current implementation of the X.500-backended LDAP server (ldapd)
   is known to work with ISODE-based DAP libraries and the QUIPU DSA.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots.

BUGS

   Bug reports should be sent to bug-ldap@umich.edu.

CAVEATS	AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None, aside from those mentioned above under	completeness.

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

   LDAP	clients	use TCP	to communicate with the	LDAP server.  The LDAP
   server normally uses	RFC 1006 with TCP/IP to	communicate with the
   DSA,	though any other transport mechanism for DSA communication
   supported by	ISODE should be	possible.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   The complete	UM-LDAP	package	has been ported	to a wide variety of
   UNIX	systems, including:  Sun3 and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.x or
   Solaris 2.x,	DECStations running Ultrix 4.3,	HP 9000	series running
   HP-UX 9.05, IBM RS6000 running AIX 3.2.5, PCs running SCO, FreeBSD,
   NetBSD, or LINUX, DEC Alphas	ruuning	OSF/1, and NeXTStatios running
   NeXTSTEP 3.2.  The complete package has also	been ported to VMS.  In
   addition, the LDAP client libraries and some	client programs	have
   been	ported to Apple	Macintosh and PCs running MSDOS	or Windows.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The complete	UM-LDAP	package	has been ported	to a wide variety of
   UNIX	systems, including:  SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x, Ultrix 4.3, HP-UX
   9.05, AIX 3.2.5, SCO, FreeBSD, NetBSD, LINUX, OSF/1,	and NeXTSTEP
   3.2.	 It has	also been ported to VMS.  In addition, the LDAP	client
   libraries and some clients have been	ported to Macintosh (System 7),
   MSDOS (some TCP/IP stacks), and Microsoft Windows 3.1, 95, and NT.

INTERNET-DRAFT			maX.500			 21 January 1996


NAME

   maX.500 :: Macintosh	DUA Interface

   University of Michigan

ABSTRACT

   maX.500 is a	Directory User Agent (client) for Apple	Macintosh.  It
   is widely used within Paradise and other Internet X.500 pilots.
   maX.500 supports searching, browsing, and modifying directory
   entries.  Display of	textual	information, playing of	audio, and
   viewing of both black-and-white (fax) and color (JPEG) images are
   supported.  Communication with directory servers is via the
   Lightweight Directory Access	Protocol (LDAP)	over TCP/IP.  maX.500
   works both with standalone LDAP directory servers (such as slapd) and
   with	X.500-backended	LDAP servers (such as ldapd).

   maX.500 is a	native Macintosh application, and has a	friendly
   interface.  It requires System Software version 6.0.5 or later and
   Apple's MacTCP or Open Transport TCP/IP networking.	The current
   version of maX.500 is 2.0.2,	although version 2.1 is	in beta	test.

   The latest information about	maX.500	can always be found on the
   maX.500 Home	Page at	this URL:
   http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/max500/

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   maX.500 works over LDAP, and	is subject to LDAP's limitations.  The
   bind, search, compare, add, delete, abandon,	modify,	and modifyrdn
   operations are all used by maX.500.	Size and time limits may be
   specified, as may alias dereferencing control.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   maX.500 currently uses LDAP as defined in RFC-1777, which does not
   support any 1993-specific X.500 features.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   Believed to be compliant with:








Apple, Rossen						       [Page 58]

INTERNET-DRAFT			maX.500			 21 January 1996



	     RFC-1274: "The COSINE and Internet	X.500 Schema"

	     RFC-1778: "The String Representation of Standard Attribute	Syntaxes"
	     RFC-1779: "A String Representation	of Distinguished Names"
	     RFC-1781: "Using the OSI Directory	to Achieve User	Friendly Naming"


CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL	RFCs

   Search filters comply with RFC-1558:	"A String Representation of LDAP
   Search Filters."  Uses the LDAP API,	as defined in RFC-1823.

INTEROPERABILITY

   maX.500 is known to work with the U-M LDAP servers (ldapd and slapd).
   It has also been tested with	other commerical LDAP servers, such as
   Control Data's server.  maX.500 has been used with a	wide variety of
   DSAs	(always	through	an LDAP	server).

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots.

BUGS

   Bug reports should be sent to max500-bugs@umich.edu.

CAVEATS	AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   maX.500 does	not support modification of "photo" (fax), "jpegPhoto",
   or "audio" attributes.  Versions of maX.500 before 2.1 did not
   support a fully functional browse facility.

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

   maX.500 is an LDAP client, and as such is uses TCP to communicate
   with	the  LDAP server.  Apple's MacTCP control panel	or Open
   Transport TCP/IP networking is required.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   maX.500 runs	on Apple Macintosh Plus	or later Macintosh computers,
   including PowerMacs.	 It requires 600K of free RAM.

INTERNET-DRAFT		       PMDF-X500		 21 January 1996


NAME

   PMDF-X500

   from:

   Innosoft International, Inc.	 1050 East Garvey Ave. South West
   Covina, California  91790

   Phone:  +1 818-919-3600 email: sales@innosoft.com

ABSTRACT

   PMDF-X500 is	Innosoft's implementation of the X.500 standards for
   Directory Services. PMDF-X500 is based upon the ISODE Consortium
   code-base. The core of PMDF-X500 is the Directory System Agent (DSA)
   server. This	server provides	directory information to Directory User
   Agents (DUA)	using either OSI or TCP/IP networking protocols. Since
   PMDF-X500 is	based on a widely used implementation, it interoperates
   particularly	well with a whole host of X.500-based products from
   other sources.

   In order to facilitate initial loading of directory data as well as
   ongoing coordination	with other directory services, PMDF-X500
   includes tools to import from and export directory information to
   Entry Description File (EDF)	files.	EDF files are flat text	files.
   PMDF-X500 provides directory	coordination functions using EDF files
   for the following directories:


	 * X.500 DSAs supporting LDAP access

	 * cc:Mail

	 * Digital's DDS

	 * GroupWise

	 * Microsoft Mail

	 * PMDF	generic	databases

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   OSI directory services as specified in CCITT	X.500 Recommendations
   and ISO 9594	use the	Directory Access Protocol (DAP)	and the




Apple, Rossen						       [Page 71]

INTERNET-DRAFT		       PMDF-X500		 21 January 1996


   Directory System Protocol (DSP).

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   PMDF-X500 does not yet support the 1993 changes to the X.500
   standard.  Support for the 1993 X.500 recommendations is planned for
   a future release of PMDF-X500.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   PMDF-X500 supports DAP and DSP accesses using Internet protocols as
   specified in	RFC 1006. In addition, the Internet community has
   proposed two	lightweight alternatives to DAP	called Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is specified	in RFC1777, and
   Connectionless Lightweight Directory	Access Protocol	(CLDAP), which
   is specified	in RFC1798.  LDAP and CLDAP, which are currently
   specified to	run over TCP/IP, are much simpler protocols than DAP and
   were	designed to reduce the cost of entry associated	with using X.500
   protocols in	client applications. PMDF-X500 includes	both LDAP and
   CLDAP servers.

   The LDAP server accesses X.500 directory information	using DAP to
   communicate with X.500  DSAs. PMDF-X500 provides an LDAP server which
   translates LDAP requests into DAP requests to communicate with X.500
   DSAs. CLDAP defines a very low overhead method for accessing	X.500
   directory information. CLDAP	is suitable for	providing access to
   information that does not require access controls.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL	RFCs

   [No information provided. --	Ed.]

INTEROPERABILITY

   PMDF-X500 interoperates with	a large	number of DUAs and DSAs. This is
   demonstated by the fact that	PMDF-X500 is DSA used by several
   Internet White Pages	Project	participants. PMDF-X500	DSA
   interoperability includes at	least all of the DSA that are used in
   the White Pages Project.

   PMDF-X500 is	delivered with several DUAs and	in addition is know to
   support the DUAs from Unisys	and Digital Equipment Corporation as
   well	as the publically available DUAs MaX500, Cello,	Swix, and the
   NASA	DUA.

CAVEATS	AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   [No information provided. --	Ed.]

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

   DAP and DSP are layered on top of the OSI protocol suite. PMDF-X500
   supports this protocol suite	over multiple network transports. For a
   pure	OSI protocol stack, DECnet/OSI can be used to provide the lower
   layers of the stack.	 In addition, PMDF-X500	supports running OSI
   upper layer protocols over a	TCP/IP transport in accordance with
   RFC1006. It is important to note that while RFC1006 specifies TCP/IP
   as a	transport, all of the OSI upper	layer protocols	are always used
   with	DAP and	DSP.

INTERNET-DRAFT		  X.500-DS, X.500-DUA		 21 January 1996


NAME

   X500-DS

   X500-DUA

   Bull	S.A.

ABSTRACT

   X500-DS and X500-DUA	are integral part of the large Bull OSI	offer.
   Although based on the DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing
   Environment/Global Directory	Service) of OSF	(Open Software
   Foundation),	these two products may be installed and	used without the
   DCE environment.Some	enhancements have been added for the user and
   the management facilities.

   X500-DS is designed to implement both the DUA and the DSA functions,
   whilst X500-DUA only	provides the DUA functions.

   The X500-DUA	package	contains:


	 * The standards APIs XOM (X/Open OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation
	   API)	and XDS	(X/Open	Directory Service API) for the
	   development of portable applications.

	 * A core DUA to translate all user's requests (bind, read,
	   list, compare, modify, modifyRDN, search, add, remove, unbind
	   ...)	into the DAP protocol used for communication with
	   distant DSAs.

	 * The OSI standard high layers	(ASN.1,	ROSE, ACSE, Presentation
	   and Session)	for communication with the distant DSAs. The
	   interface with the low layers of the	stack being XTI. RFC-
	   1006	is supported under XTI or the OSI Session.

	 * A DUA Cache to improve performances when accessing remote
	   DSAs.

	 * A powerful management application facilitating the
	   configuration of the	product	and controlling	the operations,
	   logs	and traces.

	 * A user application for the manipulations of the database
	   entries.




Apple, Rossen						       [Page 77]

INTERNET-DRAFT		  X.500-DS, X.500-DUA		 21 January 1996


	 * A generic tool to load and unload ASCII and binary files
	   in/from distributed DSAs.

	 * A DUA Server	that allows to use "A-Window-to-Directory"
	   (refer to this product description) on a PC.

   The X500-DS package contains:


	 * All components of the X500-DUA

	 * A core DSA to process all requests received from distant DUAs
	   through the DAP protocol or from distant DSAs through the DSP
	   protocol. It	supports the referral, chained and multi-casting
	   modes of operation, access control lists, simple
	   authentication, management of knowledge information (for
	   distribution, shadows and copies of sub-trees).

	 * A management	application for	managing the schema information
	   (creation, deletion and modification	of object classes and of
	   attribute types, management of the rules of the DIT).

	 * A C-ISAM database that is specially designed	for high
	   performances: e.g. 6	ms to read an entry on an Escala at the
	   XOM/XDS interface.

   These two products are easely installed, configured and administered
   thanks to the System	Management Interface Tool (SMIT) screens.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   Compliant with EWOS and OIW Agreements

   Consists of both DUA	and DSA	implementation according to the	'88
   CCITT X.500 and ISO 9594 standard. The X/Open standard XDS and XOM
   interface libraries are also	provided. When the product is installed
   with	the DCE	environment, XDS and XOM interfaces are	also used to
   access DCE/CDS (Local Cell Directory	Service) transparently.	A GDA
   (Global Directory Agent) serves then	as the gateway between the DCE
   CDS and GDS.

   It is planned to support '93	extensions in the products for 1996.
