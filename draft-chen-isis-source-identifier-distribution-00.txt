         Extensions to ISIS for Source Identifier Distribution
           draft-chen-isis-source-identifier-distribution-00

Abstract

   A Source Identifier (SI) is carried in an MPLS Source Label and used
   to identify (one of) the ingress LSR(s) to a specific LSP.  This
   document defines extensions to ISIS protocol for distribution of the
   mapping of a Source Identifier to an specific LSR.  Therefore, the
   egress and intermediate LSRs can use the SI to determine from which
   LSR an MPLS packet is sent.

   This document also defines ISIS extensions to advertise the Source
   Label Capability (SLC) of each LSR that indicates whether an LSR can
   properly process the Source Label Indicator (SLI) special purpose
   label and Source Label (SL).  With the SLC, an ingress LSR can
   determine whether it is allowed to insert a SL into the label stack
   for a specific LSP.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   As defined in [I-D.chen-mpls-source-label], a Source Identifier (SI)
   is a number in the range of [16, 65535].  Each node in a domain will
   be allocated one or more unique SIs.  A SI is carried in an
   MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) Source Label (SL) and used to
   identify (one of) the ingress Label Switching Router (LSR) to a
   specific Label Switched Path (LSP).

   To identify from where an MPLS packet is sent, the egress/
   intermediate LSRs need to know to which ingress LSR a SI is
   correlated.  Therefore, a mechanism to distribute the correlation of
   a SI to its correlated LSR is required.

   In addition, for an ingress LSR, before inserting a SL in the label
   stack of an LSP, it needs to know whether the egress LSR has the
   capability to process the SLI and SL, otherwise the packet will be
   dropped at the egress LSR.  The capability is called Source Label
   Capability (SLC).

Internet-Draft     ISIS Source Identifier Distribution      October 2014


   This document defines extensions to ISIS [RFC1195] protocol to
   distribute SI to LSR mapping and advertise the SLC of each LSR.

2.  Extensions to ISIS

   The Source Identifier sub-TLV is used to distribute the SI(s) to LSR
   mapping and the SLC.  The Source Identifier sub-TLV is advertised
   within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV that is defined in [RFC4971], it has
   the following format:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type             |             Length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           System ID                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        System ID(cond.)       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        Reserved       |          Source Identifier 1          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       ~                             ...                               ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        Reserved       |          Source Identifier n          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 1 - ISIS Source Identifier sub-TLV format

   The value of "Type" field is TBD1.

   The "Length" field defines the length of the Reserved and Source
   Identifier fields in octets, which excludes the System ID field.

   Each "Source Identifier" field (20 bits) contains a SI that
   identifies the advertising LSR.

   The "Reserved" field MUST be set to zero when sending and MUST be
   ignored when received.

3.  Elements of Procedure

   The Source Identifier sub-TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY
   TLV that is defined in [RFC4971].  All the procedures that defined in
   [RFC4971] are inherited here.

   The flooding scope of the Source Identifier sub-TLV can be either
   area local or entire IGP domain.  The flooding scope is controlled by
   the S flag in the IS-IS Router Capability TLV [RFC4971].  If the

   flooding scope is area local, the Source Identifier sub-TLV MUST be
   carried within an IS-IS Router Capability TLV with the S flag clear.
   If the flooding scope is the entire IGP domain, the Source Identifier
   sub-TLV MUST be carried within an IS-IS Router Capability TLV with
   the S flag set.

   The Source Identifier sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV.  Upon receipt
   the sub-TLV, a router will silently ignore the sub-TLV as defined in
   [RFC4971] if it does not support it.  If Source Identifier sub-TLV is
   not present that MUST be interpreted as signaling of non-support of
   SLC by the LSR.  Presence of a Source Identifier sub-TLV MUST be
   interpreted as support of SLC by the LSR.  A Source Identifier sub-
   TLV MUST appear only one time in an LSP.  When received, only first
   Source Identifier sub-TLV is valid, subsequent Source Identifier sub-
   TLVs MUST be ignored.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new sub-TLV code point for the Source
   Identifier sub-TLV carried within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV.

   Type Value  TLV Name            Reference
   ----------  ------------------  --------------
