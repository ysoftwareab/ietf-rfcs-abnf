Abstract

   Exposing network information to applications can be a basic function
   of computer networking.  Such network information can be exposed to
   applications through either the data path or the control path.  This
   informational document conducts a survey and analysis of existing
   capabilities and performance of protocols transporting network
   information to applications.

1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides a means for
   network applications to obtain network status information so that the
   applications can identify efficient application-layer traffic
   patterns using the networks.  Recently, multiple extensions are
   proposed to the ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] to extend the ability of
   ALTO to transport network information to applications.  The objective
   of this document is to put ALTO transport in the general context of
   transporting network information to applications, and evaluate ALTO
   and related protocols in their transport capabilities and
   efficiencies.

2.  Transport Designs

   There can be a large design space to transport network information to
   applications.  Broadly, the designs can be classified into two types:
   data path transport and control path transport.  An example of data
   path transport is TCP ECN options, which allows networks to convey
   network information to applications (i.e., endhosts).  In a general
   data path design, as data packets traverse a network, the network
   elements update the field(s) of the data packets to provide network
   information.  The recent development of in-network telemetry (INT)
   focuses on data path transport.  This document focuses on TCP options
   based data path transport.

   ALTO base protocol, on the other hand, is a control path design.  In
   a general control path design, the network information is collected
   by a service and exposed to applications.  This document focuses on
   ALTO transport and 3GPP NEF.

2.1.  Data Path Transport: TCP Options

2.2.  Control Path Transport: ALTO

2.3.  Control Path Transport: 3GPP NEF

3.  Capabilities

3.1.  Information Model

   The information model includes the following abilities: information
   availability, information selection, update control, etc.

3.2.  Latency

3.3.  Encoding Efficiency

4.  Security Considerations

   There can be substantial security issues when transporting network
   information to applications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This informational document does not have IANA consideration.

6.  Acknowledgments

   The author thanks many reviewers for their comments.
