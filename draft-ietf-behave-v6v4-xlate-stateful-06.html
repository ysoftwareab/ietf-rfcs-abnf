<h1><br />NAT64: Network Address and Protocol
   Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers<br />draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful-06</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>NAT64 is a mechanism for translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and
     vice-versa. DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A
     records. These two mechanisms together enable client-server
     communication between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server, without
     requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node, for the class of
     applications that work through NATs. They also enable peer-to-peer
     communication between an IPv4 and an IPv6 node, where the communication can be
     initiated by either end using existing, NAT-traversing, peer-to-peer
     communication techniques. NAT64 also support IPv4 initiated communications to a subset
	 of the IPv6 hosts through statically configured bindings in the NAT64. 
	 This document specifies NAT64, and
     gives suggestions on how it should be deployed.

Introduction</h3>

<p>This document specifies NAT64, a mechanism for IPv6-IPv4
     transition and co-existence. Together with DNS64 
	  <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-dns64'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;dns64]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bagnulo, M., Sullivan, A., Matthews, P., and I. Beijnum, &ldquo;DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, these two mechanisms allow a
     IPv6-only client to initiate communications to an IPv4-only server,
     They also enable peer-to-peer
     communication between an IPv4 and an IPv6 node, where the communication can be
     initiated by either end using existing, NAT-traversing, peer-to-peer
     communication techniques. NAT64 also support IPv4 initiated communications to a subset
	 of the IPv6 hosts through statically configured bindings in the NAT64.
</p>
<p>NAT64 is a mechanism for translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and vice-versa.
     The translation is done by translating the packet headers according 
	  to IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;v6v4&#8209;xlate]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, X., Bao, C., and F. Baker, &ldquo;IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, translating the IPv4 server
	  address by adding or removing an IPv6 prefix, and translating the IPv6 
	  client address by installing mappings in the normal NAT manner. 
</p>
<p>DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA resource records (RR)
	  from A RR. The synthesis is done by adding a IPv6 prefix to the IPv4 
	  address to create an IPv6 address, where the IPv6 prefix is assigned 
	  to a NAT64 device.
</p>
<p>Together, these two mechanisms allow a IPv6-only client to initiate
     communications to an IPv4-only server.
</p>
<p>These mechanisms are expected to play a critical role in the
     IPv4-IPv6 transition and co-existence. Due to IPv4 address depletion, 
	  it's likely that in the future, a lot of IPv6-only clients will want 
	  to connect to IPv4-only servers. The NAT64 and DNS64 mechanisms are
     easily deployable, since they require no changes to either the IPv6 client
     nor the IPv4 server. For basic functionality, the approach only requires
     the deployment of NAT64 function in the devices connecting an IPv6-only network to
     the IPv4-only network, along with the deployment of a few DNS64-enabled
     name servers in the IPv6-only network. However, some advanced features 
	  such as support for DNSSEC validating stub resolvers or support for some
	  IPsec modes, require software updates to the IPv6-only hosts.
	  
</p>
<p>The NAT64 and DNS64 mechanisms are related to the NAT-PT mechanism
     defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2766'>[RFC2766]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tsirtsis, G. and P. Srisuresh, &ldquo;Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation (NAT-PT),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, but significant differences
     exist. First, NAT64 does not define the NATPT mechanisms used to support
	  the general case of IPv6 only servers to be contacted by IPv4 only clients, but only
	  defines the mechanisms for IPv6 clients to contact IPv4 servers and its 
	  potential reuse to support peer to peer communications through standard 
	  NAT traversal techniques. Second, NAT64 includes a set of
     features that overcomes many of the reasons the original NAT-PT
     specification was moved to historic status <a class='info' href='#RFC4966'>[RFC4966]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aoun, C. and E. Davies, &ldquo;Reasons to Move the Network Address Translator - Protocol Translator (NAT-PT) to Historic Status,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Features of NAT64</h3>

<p>The features of NAT64 are:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> NAT64 as specified in this document is compliant with the
           recommendations for how NATs should handle UDP <a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, TCP <a class='info' href='#RFC5382'>[RFC5382]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Guha, S., Biswas, K., Ford, B., Sivakumar, S., and P. Srisuresh, &ldquo;NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, and ICMP 
		    <a class='info' href='#RFC5508'>[RFC5508]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Srisuresh, P., Ford, B., Sivakumar, S., and S. Guha, &ldquo;NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. As such, NAT64 only supports Endpoint-Independent mappings
			and supports both Endpoint-Independent and Address dependent filtering. 
			Because of the compliance with the aforementioned requirements, NAT64 is compatible 
			with ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>In the absence of any state in NAT64 regarding a given IPv6
		     node, only said IPv6 node can initiate sessions to IPv4 nodes.
		     This works for roughly the same class of applications that work
	         through IPv4-to-IPv4 NATs.
</li>
<li>Depending on the filtering policy used (Endpoint-Independent,
		   or Address-Dependent), IPv4-nodes MAY be able
		   to initiate sessions to a given IPv6 node, if the NAT64 somehow has an
		   appropriate mapping (i.e.,state) for said IPv6 node, via one of the
		   following mechanism.
				
<ul class="text">
<li> The IPv6 node has recently initiated a session to the
					same or other external-IPv4 node.
</li>
<li> The IPv6 node has used a NAT-traversal technique (such as ICE) 
					which essentially results in the previous bullet point.
</li>
<li> If static configuration (i.e. mapping) exists
					regarding said IPv6 node
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Overview</h3>

<p>This section provides a non-normative introduction to the mechanisms
     of NAT64.	This is achieved by describing the NAT64 behavior involving a simple 
	setup, that involves a single NAT64 box, a single DNS64 box and a simple
	network topology. The goal of this description is to provide the reader with 
	a general view of NAT64.  It is not the goal of this
	section to describe all possible configurations nor to provide a normative 
	specification of the NAT64 behavior. The normative specification of NAT64 
	is provided in <a class='info' href='#normative'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>NAT64 Normative Specification</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>NAT64 mechanism is implemented in an NAT64 box which has (at least) two
     interfaces, an IPv4 interface connected to the the IPv4 network, and an
     IPv6 interface connected to the IPv6 network. Packets generated in the
     IPv6 network for a receiver located in the IPv4 network will be routed
     within the IPv6 network towards the NAT64 box. The NAT64 box will
     translate them and forward them as IPv4 packets through the IPv4 network
     to the IPv4 receiver. The reverse takes place for packets generated in
     the IPv4 network for an IPv6 receiver. NAT64, however, is not symmetric.
     In order to be able to perform IPv6 - IPv4 translation NAT64 requires state, 
	  binding an IPv6 address and port (hereafter called an IPv6 transport address) 
	  to an IPv4 address and port (hereafter called an IPv4 transport address).
</p>
<p>Such binding state is either statically configured in the NAT64 or it is 
	 created when the first packet flowing from the
     IPv6 network to the IPv4 network is translated. After the binding state
     has been created, 
	 packets flowing in either direction on that particular
     flow are translated. The result is that, in the general case, NAT64 only supports
     communications initiated by the IPv6-only node towards an IPv4-only
     node. Some additional mechanisms (like ICE) or static binding configuration, can be used 
	 to provide support for communications initiated by the
     IPv4-only node to the IPv6-only node.

NAT64 solution elements</h3>

<p>In this section we describe the different elements involved in the
       NAT64 approach.
</p>
<p>The main component of the proposed solution is the translator
       itself. The translator has essentially two main parts, the address
       translation mechanism and the protocol translation mechanism.
</p>
<p>Protocol translation from IPv4 packet header to IPv6 packet header
       and vice-versa is performed according to <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate'>IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, X., Bao, C., and F. Baker, &ldquo;IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;v6v4&#8209;xlate].
</p>
<p>Address translation maps IPv6 transport addresses to IPv4 transport
       addresses and vice-versa. In order to create these mappings the NAT64
       box has two pools of addresses i.e. an IPv6 address pool (to represent
       IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 network) and an IPv4 address pool (to
       represent IPv6 addresses in the IPv4 network). 
</p>
<p>The IPv6 address pool is an IPv6 prefix assigned to the translator 
	   itself (hereafter called Pref64::/n). Due to the abundance of IPv6 address space, 
	   it is possible to assign an Pref64::/n that is equal or even bigger than the whole IPv4 address space. This allows
       each IPv4 address to be mapped into a different IPv6 address by simply
       concatenating the Pref64::/n with the IPv4 address being mapped and a suffix (i.e. an IPv4 address X is
       mapped into the IPv6 address Pref64:X:SUFFIX). The provisioning of the Pref64::/n is 
 	   discussed at length in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-address-format'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;address&#8209;format]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bao, C., Huitema, C., Bagnulo, M., Boucadair, M., and X. Li, &ldquo;IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> 
</p>
<p>The IPv4 address pool is a set of IPv4 addresses,
       normally a small prefix assigned by the local administrator. Since IPv4 
		address space is a scarce resource, the IPv4 address pool is small and 
		typically not sufficient to establish permanent one-to-one mappings with IPv6
       addresses. So, except for the static/manually created ones, 
	   mappings using the IPv4 address pool will be created
       and released dynamically. Moreover, because of the IPv4 address
       scarcity, the usual practice for NAT64 is likely to be the mapping of
       IPv6 transport addresses into IPv4 transport addresses, instead of
       IPv6 addresses into IPv4 addresses directly, which enable a higher
       utilization of the limited IPv4 address pool.
</p>
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of the IPv6 to IPv4 address mapping
       and the static nature of the IPv4 to IPv6 address mapping, it is easy
       to understand that it is far simpler to allow communication initiated
       from the IPv6 side toward an IPv4 node, which address is algorithmically 
       mapped into an IPv6 address, than communications initiated from
       IPv4-only nodes to an IPv6 node in which case IPv4 address needs to be
       associated with it dynamically.
</p>
<p>An IPv6 initiator can know or derive in advance the IPv6 address
       representing the IPv4 target and send packets to that address. The
       packets are intercepted by the NAT64 device, which associates an IPv4 transport
       address of its IPv4 pool to the IPv6 transport address of the
       initiator, creating binding state, so that reply packets can be
       translated and forwarded back to the initiator. The binding state is
       kept while packets are flowing. Once the flow stops, and based on a
       timer, the IPv4 transport address is returned to the IPv4 address pool
       so that it can be reused for other communications.
</p>
<p>To allow an IPv6 initiator to do the standard DNS lookup to learn
       the address of the responder, DNS64 <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-dns64'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;dns64]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bagnulo, M., Sullivan, A., Matthews, P., and I. Beijnum, &ldquo;DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> 
		is used to synthesize an AAAA RR  from the A
       RR (containing the real IPv4 address of the responder). DNS64
       receives the DNS queries generated by the IPv6 initiator. If there is
       no AAAA record available for the target node (which is the normal case
       when the target node is an IPv4-only node), DNS64 performs a query for
       the A record. If an A record is returned, DNS64 creates a synthetic
       AAAA RR that includes the IPv6 representations of the IPv4 address
 	   created by concatenating the Pref64::/n of a NAT64 to the responder's IPv4
       address and a suffix (i.e. if the IPv4 node has IPv4 address X, then the synthetic
       AAAA RR will contain the IPv6 address formed as Pref64:X:SUFFIX). The
       synthetic AAAA RR is passed back to the IPv6 initiator, which will
       initiate an IPv6 communication with the IPv6 address associated to the
       IPv4 receiver. The packet will be routed to the NAT64 device, which
       will create the IPv6 to IPv4 address mapping as described before.

NAT64 Behaviour Walkthrough</h3>

<p>In this example, we consider an IPv6 node located in a IPv6-only

</p>
<p>The notation used is the following: upper case letters are IPv4

</pre></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>The figure shows a IPv6 node H1 which has an IPv6 address Y' and an
       IPv4 node H2 with IPv4 address X.
</p>
<p>A NAT64 connects the IPv6 network to the IPv4 network. This NAT64 has
       a /n prefix (called Pref64::/n) that it uses to represent IPv4 addresses in
		the IPv6 address space and a single IPv4 address T assigned to its IPv4 interface.
		The routing is configured in such a way, that the IPv6 packets addressed
		to a destination address containing Pref64::/n are routed to the IPv6
		interface of the NAT64 box. 
</p>
<p>Also shown is a local name server with DNS64 functionality. The local 
		name server needs to know the /n prefix assigned to the
       local NAT64 (Pref64::/n). For the purpose of this example, we assume
       it learns this through manual configuration.
</p>
<p>For this example, assume the typical DNS situation where IPv6 hosts
       have only stub resolvers and the local name server does the recursive
       lookups.
</p>
<p>The steps by which H1 establishes communication with H2 are: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>H1 performs a DNS query for FQDN(H2) and receives the synthetic
	 			AAAA RR from the local name server that implements the 
	    		DNS64 functionality. The AAAA record contains an IPv6 address formed 
	 			by the Pref64::/n associated to the NAT64 box and
               the IPv4 address of H2 and a suffix (i.e. Pref64:X:SUFFIX).
</li>
<li>H1 sends a packet
           to H2. The packet is sent from a source transport address of
           (Y',y) to a destination transport address of (Pref64:X:SUFFIX,x), where y
           and x are ports set by H1.
</li>
<li>The packet is routed to the IPv6 interface of the NAT64 (since
            the IPv6 routing is configured that way).
</li>
<li>The NAT64 receives the packet and performs the following
           actions: 
<ul class="text">
<li>The NAT64 selects an unused port t on its IPv4 address T
               and creates the mapping entry (Y',y) &lt;--&gt; (T,t)
</li>
<li>The NAT64 translates the IPv6 header into an IPv4 header
               using IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;v6v4&#8209;xlate]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, X., Bao, C., and F. Baker, &ldquo;IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The NAT64 includes (T,t) as source transport address in the
               packet and (X,x) as destination transport address in the
               packet. Note that X is extracted directly from the destination 
			   IPv6 address of the received IPv6
               packet that is being translated.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The NAT64 sends the translated packet out its IPv4
           interface and the packet arrives at H2.
</li>
<li>H2 node responds by sending a packet with destination transport
           address (T,t) and source transport address (X,x).
</li>
<li>The packet is routed to the NAT64 box, which will look for an
           existing mapping containing (T,t). Since the mapping (Y',y)
           &lt;--&gt; (T,t) exists, the NAT64 performs the following
           operations: 
<ul class="text">
<li>The NAT64 translates the IPv4 header into an IPv6 header
               using IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;v6v4&#8209;xlate]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, X., Bao, C., and F. Baker, &ldquo;IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The NAT64 includes (Y',y) as destination transport address in
               the packet and (Pref64:X:SUFFIX,x) as source transport address
               in the packet. Note that X is extracted directly from the
               source IPv4 address of the received IPv4 packet that is being
               translated.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The translated packet is sent out the IPv6 interface to
           H1.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The packet exchange between H1 and H2 continues and packets are
       translated in the different directions as previously
       described.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the translation still works if the 
			IPv6 initiator H1 learns the IPv6 representation of H2's IPv4 
			address (i.e. Pref64:X:SUFFIX) through some scheme other than a DNS look-up. 
			This is because the DNS64 processing does NOT
       result in any state installed in the NAT64 box and because the mapping
       of the IPv4 address into an IPv6 address is the result of
       concatenating the prefix defined within the site for this purpose
       (called Pref64::/n in this document) to the original IPv4
       address and a suffix.

Filtering</h3>

<p>A NAT64 box may do filtering, which means that it only allows a
       packet in through an interface if the appropriate permission exists.
	   The NAT64 can do filtering of IPv6 packets based on the administrative 
	   rules to create BIB and session entries. The filtering can be flexible 
	   enough and broad enough but the idea of the filtering is to provide the 
	   operators necessary control to avoid DoS attacks that would result in 
	   exhaustion of NAT64 address, port, memory and CPU resources. Filtering techniques of 
	   incoming IPv6 packets is not specific to the NAT64 and therefore is not described in this specification.
</p>
<p>Filtering of IPv4 packets on the other hand is tightly coupled to the NAT64 state and
		therefore is described in this specification. In this document, we consider that the
	       NAT64 may do no filtering, or it may filter incoming IPv4 packets.
</p>
<p>NAT64 filtering of incoming IPv4 packets is consistent with the recommendations of RFC
       4787 <a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, and the ones of
		RFC 5382 <a class='info' href='#RFC5382'>[RFC5382]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Guha, S., Biswas, K., Ford, B., Sivakumar, S., and P. Srisuresh, &ldquo;NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Because of that, the NAT64
		as specified in this document, supports both Endpoint-Independent filtering 
		and Address-Dependent filtering, both for TCP and UDP.
</p>
<p>If a NAT64 performs Endpoint-Independent filtering of incoming IPv4 packets,
			then an incoming IPv4 packet is dropped unless the NAT64 has state for the 
			destination transport address of the incoming IPv4 packet.
</p>
<p>
		If a NAT64 performs Address-Dependent filtering of incoming IPv4 packets, then an incoming IPv4 packet is dropped
		unless the NAT64 has state involving the destination transport address of the IPv4 incoming packet 
		and the particular source IP address of the incoming IPv4 packet.

	     addresses and one with IPv6 addresses. 
</dd>
<dt>5-Tuple:</dt>
<dd>The tuple (source IP address, source port,

         addresses and one with IPv6 addresses. 
</dd>
<dt>BIB:</dt>

<dt>Endpoint-Independent Mapping:</dt>
<dd>In NAT64, using the same

</dd>
<dt>Filtering, Address-Dependent:</dt>
<dd>
         The NAT64 filters out incoming IPv4 packets not destined to a transport

		 IPv4 packets coming from IPv4 address X and
         destined for a transport address that it has state for if the NAT64 has not
         sent packets to X previously (independently of the port
         used by X).
		 In other words, for receiving packets from a

<dt>Hairpinning:</dt>
<dd>Having a packet do a "U-turn" inside a NAT
         and come back out the same interface as it arrived on. Hairpinning
         support is important for peer-to-peer applications, as there are
         cases when two different hosts on the same side of a NAT can only
         communicate using sessions that hairpin through the NAT.
</dd>
<dt>Mapping or Binding:</dt>
<dd>A mapping between an IPv6 transport address and a
         IPv4 transport address. Used to translate the addresses and ports
         of packets flowing between the IPv6 host and the IPv4 host. 
	      In NAT64, the IPv4 transport address is always
         a transport address assigned to the NAT64 itself, while the IPv6
         transport address belongs to some IPv6 host.
</dd>
<dt>NAT64:</dt>
<dd>A device that translates IPv6 packets to IPv4
         packets and vice-versa. The NAT64 uses mapping state to 
 		 perform the translation between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. The translation involves not only the
         IP header, but also the transport header (TCP or UDP).
</dd>
<dt>Session:</dt>
<dd>A TCP, UDP or ICMP Query session. In other words, the
         bi-directional flow of packets between two different
         hosts. In NAT64, typically one host is an IPv4 host, and the
         other one is an IPv6 host.

NAT64 Normative Specification</h3>

<p>A NAT64 is a device with at least one IPv6 interface and at least one IPv4 interface.
       Each NAT64 device MUST have one unicast /n IPv6 prefix assigned to it,
       denoted Pref64::/n (Additional consideration about the Pref64::/n are presented in
 		<a class='info' href='#address-transform'>Section&nbsp;3.2.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Generation of the IPv6 representations of IPv4 addresses</span><span>)</span></a>). Each NAT64 box MUST have one or more unicast
       IPv4 addresses assigned to it. 
</p>
<p>A NAT64 uses the following dynamic data structures:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>UDP Binding Information Base
</li>
<li>UDP Session Table
</li>
<li>TCP Binding Information Base
</li>
<li>TCP Session Table
</li>
<li>ICMP Query Binding Information Base
</li>
<li>ICMP Query Session Table
</li>
</ul>

<p>These tables contain information needed for the NAT64 processing. The actual
			 division of the information into six tables is done in order to ease the 
			description of the NAT64 behaviour. NAT64 implementations MAY use different data structures
			as long as they store all the required information and the externally
		       visible outcome is the same as the one described in this document.
</p>
<p>A NAT64 has three Binding Information Bases (BIBs): one for TCP, one for
       UDP and one for ICMP Queries. In the case of UDP and TCP BIBs, each
  	   BIB entry specifies a mapping between an IPv6 transport address
       and an IPv4 transport address:</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(X',x) &lt;--&gt; (T,t)
</p>
</blockquote><p>where X' is some IPv6 address, T is an IPv4 address, and x and t
       are ports. T will always be one of the IPv4 addresses assigned to the NAT64.
	   The BIB has then two columns, the BIB IPv6 transport address and the BIB IPv4 transport address.
       A given IPv6 or IPv4 transport address can appear
       in at most one entry in a BIB: for example, (2001:db8::17, 4) can
       appear in at most one TCP and at most one UDP BIB entry. TCP and UDP
       have separate BIBs because the port number space for TCP and UDP are
       distinct. This implementation of the BIBs ensures Endpoint-Independent mappings in the NAT64.
		The information in the BIBs is also used to implement Endpoint-Independent filtering.
		(Address-Dependent filtering is implemented using the Session tables described below.)
</p>
<p>In the case of the ICMP Query BIB, each ICMP Query BIB entry specify a 
		mapping between an (IPv6 address, IPv6 Identifier)
	    pair and an (IPv4 address, IPv4 Identifier) pair.
		</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(X',I1) &lt;--&gt; (T,I2)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
	    where X' is some IPv6 address, T is an IPv4 address, I1 is an ICMPv6 Identifier and I2
	    is an ICMPv4 Identifiers. T will always be one of the IPv4 addresses assigned to the NAT64.
	    A given (IPv6 or IPv4 address, IPv6 or IPv4 Identifier) pair can appear
	    in at most one entry in the ICMP Query BIB. 
</p>
<p>Entries in any of the three BIBs can be created dynamically as the result of the
		flow of packets as described in the <a class='info' href='#sec-session-info'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Filtering and Updating Binding and Session Information</span><span>)</span></a>
		but the can also be created manually by the system administrator. NAT64
		implementations SHOULD support manually configured BIB entries for any of the three BIBs.
		Dynamically-created entries are deleted from the corresponding BIB when the last session 
		associated to the BIB entry is removed from the session table. 
		Manually-configured BIB entries are not deleted when there is no corresponding
		session table entry and can only be deleted by the administrator.
</p>
<p>A NAT64 also has three session tables: one for TCP sessions, one
       for UDP sessions and one for ICMP Query sessions. Each entry keeps information on the state of the
       corresponding session. 
	   In the TCP and UDP session tables, each entry specifies a mapping between a pair of IPv6 transport address
       and a pair of IPv4 transport address:</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(X',x),(Y',y) &lt;--&gt; (T,t),(Z,z)
</p>
</blockquote><p>where X' and Y' are IPv6 addresses, T and Z are IPv4 addresses, and x, y, z and t
       are ports. T will always be one of the IPv4 addresses assigned to the NAT64.
	   Y' is always the IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address Z, so Y' is obtained
	   from Z using the algorithm applied by the NAT64 to create IPv6 representations of 
	   IPv4 addresses. y will always be equal to z. 
</p>
<p>For each Session Table Entry (STE), there are then five columns:
			</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The STE source IPv6 transport address, (X',x) in the example above,
</p>
<p>The STE destination IPv6 transport address,  (Y',y) in the example above,
</p>
<p>The STE source IPv4 transport address,  (T,t) in the example above, and,
</p>
<p>The STE destination IPv4 transport address,  (Z,z) in the example above.
</p>
<p>The STE lifetime.
</p>
</blockquote><p>
			The terminology used for the session table entry columns is from the perspective 
			of an incoming IPv6 packet being translated into an outgoing IPv4 packet.
</p>
<p>In the ICMP query session table, each entry specifies a mapping between a 3-tuple of IPv6 source address,
	   IPv6 destination address and ICMPv6 Query Id and a 3-tuple of IPv4 source address,
		   IPv4 destination address and ICMPv4 Query Id:</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(X',Y',I1) &lt;--&gt; (T,Z,I2)
</p>
</blockquote><p>where X' and Y' are IPv6 addresses, T and Z are IPv4 addresses, I1 is an ICMPv6 Identifier and I2
       is an ICMPv4 Identifier. T will always be one of the IPv4 addresses assigned to the NAT64.
	   Y' is always the IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address Z, so Y' is obtained
	   from Z using the algorithm applied by the NAT64 to create IPv6 representations of 
	   IPv4 addresses.
</p>
<p>For each Session Table Entry (STE), there are then six columns:
			</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The STE source IPv6 address, X' in the example above,
</p>
<p>The STE destination IPv6 address,  Y' in the example above,
</p>
<p>The STE IPv6 Identifier, I1 in the example above,
</p>
<p>The STE source IPv4 address, T in the example above,
</p>
<p>The STE destination IPv4 address, Z in the example above, and,
</p>
<p>The STE IPv4 Identifier, I2 in the example above.
</p>
<p>The STE lifetime.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NAT64 uses the session state information to determine when the
       session is completed, and also uses session information for Address-Dependent
       filtering. A session can be uniquely identified by either an incoming
       tuple or an outgoing tuple.
</p>
<p>For each TCP or UDP session, there is a corresponding BIB entry, uniquely
       specified by either the source IPv6 transport address 
       (in the IPv6 --&gt; IPv4 direction) or the destination IPv4 transport address (in the IPv4
       --&gt; IPv6 direction). For each ICMP Query session, there is a corresponding BIB entry, uniquely
       specified by either the source IPv6 address and ICMPv6 Query Id
       (in the IPv6 --&gt; IPv4 direction) or the 
	   destination IPv4 address and the ICMPv4 Query Id (in the IPv4
       --&gt; IPv6 direction). However, for all the BIBs, a single BIB entry can have multiple
       corresponding sessions. When the last corresponding session is
       deleted, if the BIB entry was dynamically created, the BIB entry is deleted.
</p>
<p>The NAT64 will receive packets through its interfaces. These packets can be either IPv6
		packets or IPv4 packets and they may carry TCP traffic, UDP traffic or ICMP traffic. The processing 
		of the packets will be described next. In the case that the processing is common to all the aforementioned
		types of packets, we will refer to the packet as the incoming packet in general. In case that the processing
		is specific to IPv6 packets, we will refer to the incoming IPv6 packet and similarly to the IPv4 packets.
</p>
<p> The processing of an incoming 
		IP packet takes the following steps:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Determining the incoming tuple
</li>
<li>Filtering and updating binding and session information
</li>
<li>Computing the outgoing tuple
</li>
<li>Translating the packet
</li>
<li>Handling hairpinning
</li>
</ol><p>The details of these steps are specified in the following
       subsections.
</p>
<p>This breakdown of the NAT64 behavior into processing steps is done
       for ease of presentation. A NAT64 MAY perform the steps in a different
       order, or MAY perform different steps, as long as the externally
       visible outcome is the same.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Determining the Incoming tuple</h3>

<p>This step associates a incoming tuple with every incoming IP packet 
			for use in subsequent steps. In the case of TCP, UDP and ICMP error packets, the 
			tuple is a 5-tuple consisting of source IP address,
	         source port, destination IP address, destination port, transport
	         protocol. In case of ICMP Queries, the tuple is a 3-tuple consisting of 
	         the source IP address, destination IP address and Query Identifier.
</p>
<p>If the incoming IP packet contains a complete (un-fragmented) UDP
         or TCP protocol packet, then the 5-tuple is computed by extracting
         the appropriate fields from the packet.
</p>
<p>If the incoming packet is an ICMP query message (i.e. an ICMPv4 Query message 
			or an ICMPv6 Informational message), the 3-tuple is the source IP address,
			the destination IP address and the ICMP Query Identifier.
</p>
<p>If the incoming IP packet contains a complete (un-fragmented)
         ICMP error message containing a UDP or a TCP segment, then the 5-tuple is computed by extracting the
         appropriate fields from the IP packet embedded inside the ICMP
         error message. However, the role of source and destination is swapped when
         doing this: the embedded source IP address becomes the destination
         IP address in the 5-tuple, the embedded source port becomes the
         destination port in the 5-tuple, etc. If it is not possible to
         determine the 5-tuple (perhaps because not enough of the embedded
         packet is reproduced inside the ICMP message), then the incoming IP
         packet is silently discarded.
</p>
<p>If the incoming IP packet contains a complete (un-fragmented)
         ICMP error message containing an ICMP Query message, then the 3-tuple is computed by extracting the
         appropriate fields from the IP packet embedded inside the ICMP
         error message. However, the role of source and destination is swapped when
         doing this: the embedded source IP address becomes the destination
         IP address in the 3-tuple, the embedded destination  IP address becomes the source 
		 address in the 3-tuple and the embedded Identifier is used as the Identifier of the 3-tuple
         If it is not possible to
         determine the 3-tuple (perhaps because not enough of the embedded
         packet is reproduced inside the ICMP message), then the incoming IP
         packet is silently discarded.
</p>
<p>If the incoming IP packet contains a fragment, then more
         processing may be needed. 
			</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The NAT64 MUST reassemble the fragments and process the full packet
					conditioned to the following:
					</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The NAT64 MUST limit the amount of resources
							devoted to the storage of fragmented packets
							in order to protect from DoS attack. 
</p>
<p> As long as the NAT64 has available resources, 
							the NAT64 MUST allow the fragments to arrive 
							over a time interval. The time interval 
							MUST be configurable and the default value MUST
							be of at least 2 seconds.
</p>
<p> The NAT64 MAY require that the UDP, TCP, or ICMP header be
							completely contained within the fragment that contains

<p>Implementers of NAT64 should be aware that there are a number of

Filtering and Updating Binding and Session Information</h3>

<p>This step updates binding and session information stored in the

</p>
<p>Irrespectively of the transport protocol used, the NAT64 must silently discard

			Considerations section. In addition, the NAT64 function will only process incoming 
			IPv6 packets that contain a destination address that contains Pref64::/n.
			Likewise, the NAT64 function will only process incoming 
			IPv4 packets that contain a destination address that belong to the IPv4 pool assigned to the NAT64.

UDP Session Handling</h3>

<p>The state information stored for a UDP session in the UDP session table includes a timer that

		   UDP BIB entry are deleted, then the UDP BIB entry is also deleted (only applies to the case of dynamically created entries).
</p>
<p>An IPv6 incoming packet with an incoming tuple with source transport address (X',x) and 
			destination transport address (Y',y) is processed as follows:
			</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The NAT64 searches 
				for a UDP BIB entry that contains an BIB IPv6 transport address that matches the IPv6 source transport address (X',x). 
				If such an entry does not exists, a new entry is created.

<p>The NAT64 searches for the session table entry
               corresponding to the incoming 5-tuple. If no such entry is

				The information included in the session table is as follows:
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">

<p>The STE destination IPv4 transport is set to (Z(Y'),y),  y being the same port as

</blockquote>

<p>An IPv4 incoming packet, with an incoming tuple with source IPv4 transport address (Y,y) and 
			destination IPv4 transport address (X,x) is processed as follows:
			</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The NAT64 searches 
				for a UDP BIB entry that contains an BIB IPv4 transport address matches (Y,y) i.e. the IPv4 destination transport address in the incoming IPv4 packet. 
				If such an entry does not exists, the packet is dropped.  An ICMP message MAY be sent to the
	               original sender of the packet, unless the discarded packet is
	               itself an ICMP message. The ICMP message, if sent, has a type

</p>
<p>If the NAT64

               the incoming packet is allowed according to the
               address-dependent filtering rule. To do this, it searches for 
				a session table entry with a STE source IPv4 transport address 
				equal to (X,x) (i.e. the destination IPv4 transport address in the incoming packet) 
				 and STE destination IPv4 address 
				equal to Y (i.e. the source IPv4 address in the incoming packet).
				If such an entry

</p>
<p>In case the packet is not discarded in the previous processing (either because the NAT64

Rules for allocation of IPv4 transport addresses for UDP</h3>

<p>If the rules specify that a new UDP BIB entry is created for a source

</p>
<p>If the port s is in the Well-Known port range 0..1023, then
	             the NAT64 SHOULD allocate a port t from this same range. Otherwise, if the port s
	             is in the range 1024..65535, then the NAT64 SHOULD allocate a port t from this
	             range. Furthermore, if port s is even, then t SHOULD be even, and
	             if port s is odd, then t SHOULD be odd.

							the NAT64 is waiting for a matching TCP FIN in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>V6 FIN + V4 FIN RCV: Both an IPv4 packet containing a TCP FIN and an IPv6 packet containing an TCP FIN for
						this connection were received by the NAT64. The NAT64 keeps the connection state alive and forwards packet 
						in both directions for a short period of time to allow remaining packets (in particular the ACKs) to be delivered.
</p>
<p>RST RCV: A packet containing a TCP RST was received by the NAT64 for this connection. The NAT64 will keep the state
						for the connection for a short time and if no other data packets for that connection are received, the assumption is that 
						the node has accepted the RST packet and the state for this connection is then terminated.

</blockquote>

<p>The state machine used by the NAT64 for the TCP session processing is depicted next.
				The described state machine handles all TCP segments received through the IPv6 and IPv4 interface.
				There is one state machine per TCP connection that is potentially established through the NAT64. 
				After bootstrapping of the NAT64 device, all TCP session are in CLOSED state. As we mention above, 
				the CLOSED state is a fictional state when is no state for that
				particular connection in the NAT64. It should be noted that there is one state machine per connection, so only
				packets belonging to a given connection are inputs to the state machine associated to that connection. In other words,
				when in the state machine below we state that a packet is received, it is implicit that the incoming 5-tuple of the data packet
				matches to the one of the state machine.
</p>
<p> A TCP segment with the SYN flag set that is received through the IPv6 interface is
					called a V6 SYN, similarly, V4 SYN, V4 FIN, V6 FIN, V6 FIN + V4 FIN, V6 RST and V4 RST.

Rules for allocation of IPv4 transport addresses for TCP</h3>

<p>If the rules specify that a new TCP BIB entry is created for a source
	         transport address of (S',s), then the NAT64 allocates an IPv4 transport
	         address for this BIB entry as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>If there exists some other BIB entry containing S' as the IPv6
	             address and mapping it to some IPv4 address T, then use T as the
	             IPv4 address. Otherwise, use any IPv4 address of the IPv4 pool assigned to the NAT64 to be used for translation.
</p>
<p>If the port s is in the Well-Known port range 0..1023, and the NAT64 has an 
					available port t in the same port range, then the NAT64 SHOULD allocate the port t. 
					If the NAT64 does not have a port available in the same range, 
					the NAT64 SHOULD assign a port t from other range where it has an available port. 
</p>
<p>If the port s is in the range 1024..65535, and the NAT64 has an 
					available port t in the same port range, then the NAT64 SHOULD allocate the port t. 
					If the NAT64 does not have a port available in the same range, 
					the NAT64 SHOULD assign a port t from other range where it has an available port. 
</p>
<p>In all cases, the allocated IPv4 transport address (T,t) MUST
	             NOT be in use in another entry in the same BIB, but MAY be in
	             use in the other BIB (referring to the UDP and TCP BIBs).
</p>
</blockquote><p>If it is not possible to allocate an appropriate IPv4
	         transport address or create a BIB entry for some reason, then the

ICMP Query Session Handling</h3>

<p>The state information stored for an ICMP Query session in the ICMP Query session table includes a timer that
           tracks the remaining lifetime of the session. When the timer
           expires, the session is deleted. If all the sessions corresponding to a 
		   ICMP Query BIB entry are deleted, then the ICMP Query BIB entry is also deleted in the case of dynamically created entries.
</p>
<p>An incoming ICMPv6 Informational packet with IPv6 source address X', IPv6 destination address Y' and Identifier I1, is processed as follows:
			</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
				If the local security policy determines that ICMPv6 Informative packets are to be filtered, the packet is silently discarded.
				Else, the NAT64 searches 
				for a ICMP Query BIB entry that matches the (X',I1) pair. 
				If such entry does not exist, a new entry is created with the following data:
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The BIB IPv6 address is set to X' i.e. the source IPv6 address of the IPv6 packet.
</p>
<p>The BIB ICMPv6 Query Id is set to I1 i.e. the ICMPv6 Query Identifier.
</p>
<p>If there exists some other BIB entry containing the same IPv6
	             		address X' and mapping it to some IPv4 address T, then use T as the
	             		BIB IPv4 address for this new entry. Otherwise, use any IPv4 address assigned to the IPv4
	             		interface.
</p>
<p>As the BIB ICMPv4 Identifier use any available value i.e. any identifier value for which
						no other entry exists with the same (IPv4 address, ICMPv4 Query Id) pair.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NAT64 searches for an ICMP query session table entry
               corresponding to the incoming 3-tuple (X',Y',I1). If no such entry is
               found, a new entry is created.
				The information included in the new session table entry is as follows: 
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The STE IPv6 source address is set to the X' i.e. the address contained in the received IPv6 packet,
</p>
<p>The STE IPv6 destination address is set to the Y' i.e. the address contained in the received IPv6 packet,
</p>
<p>The STE IPv6 identifier is set to the I1 I.e. the identifier contained in the received IPv6 packet,
</p>
<p>The STE IPv4 source address is set to the IPv4 address contained in the corresponding BIB entry,
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NAT64 sets or resets the timer in the session table
               entry to maximum session lifetime. By default, the maximum
               session lifetime is 60 seconds. The maximum lifetime value SHOULD be configurable.
 			   The packet is translated and forwarded as described in the following sections.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An incoming ICMPv4 Query packet with source IPv4 address Y, 
					destination IPv4 address X and Identifier I2 is processed as follows:
			</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The NAT64 searches 
				for a ICMP Query BIB entry that contains X as IPv4 address matches and I2 as the IPv4 Identifier. 
				If such an entry does not exists, the packet is dropped.  An ICMP message MAY be sent to the
	               original sender of the packet, unless the discarded packet is
	               itself an ICMP message. The ICMP message, if sent, has a type
	               of 3 (Destination Unreachable).
</p>
<p>If the NAT64
               filters on its IPv4 interface, then the NAT64 checks to see if
               the incoming packet is allowed according to the
               address-dependent filtering rule. To do this, it searches for 
			   a session table entry with a STE source IPv4 address equal to X, an STE IPv4 Identifier equal to I2 
			   and a STE destination IPv4 address equal to Y. 
				If such an entry
               is found (there may be more than one), packet processing
               continues. Otherwise, the packet is discarded. If the packet
               is discarded, then an ICMP message MAY be sent to the
               original sender of the packet, unless the discarded packet is
               itself an ICMP message. The ICMP message, if sent, has a type
               of 3 (Destination Unreachable) and a code of 13 (Communication
               Administratively Prohibited).
</p>
<p>In case the packet is not discarded in the previous processing (either because the NAT64 
				is not filtering or because the packet is compliant with the Address-dependent filtering rule), 
				then the NAT64 searches for
                a session table entry with a STE source IPv4 address equal to X, an STE IPv4 Identifier equal to I2 
				   and a STE destination IPv4 address equal to Y. If no such entry is
                found, a new entry is created with the following information:

<p>The NAT64 sets or resets the timer in the session table

Generation of the IPv6 representations of IPv4 addresses</h3>

<p>NAT64 support multiple algorithms for the generation of the IPv6 representation of an IPv4 address.
							The constraints imposed to the generation algorithms are the following:
							</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The same algorithm to create an IPv6 address from an IPv4 address MUST be used by: 
									</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The DNS64 to create the IPv6 address to be returned in the synthetic

</p>
<p>The NAT64 to create the IPv6 address to be included in the destination address
											field of the outgoing IPv6 packets from the IPv4 address included in the destination address
											field of the incoming IPv4 packet.
</p>
</blockquote>	 

<p>The algorithm MUST be reversible, i.e. it MUST be possible to extract the original IPv4 address
									from the IPv6 representation. 
</p>
<p>The input for the algorithm MUST be limited to the IPv4 address, the IPv6 prefix (denoted Pref64::/n) used in the

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Implications on end-to-end security.
</p>
<p>Any protocol that protect IP header information are essentially incompatible
	with NAT64. So, this implies that end to end IPsec verification will fail when 
	AH is used (both transport and tunnel mode) and when ESP is used in transport mode. 
	This is inherent to any network layer translation mechanism. End-to-end IPsec protection
	can be restored, using UDP encapsulation as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3948'>[RFC3948]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huttunen, A., Swander, B., Volpe, V., DiBurro, L., and M. Stenberg, &ldquo;UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
	The actual extensions to support IPsec are out of the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>Filtering.
</p>
<p>NAT64 creates binding state using packets flowing from the IPv6 side
   to the IPv4 side.  In accordance with the procedures defined in this
	document following the guidelines defined in RFC 4787 
	<a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> a NAT64 must offer
   "enpoint independent filtering". This means:
	</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> for any IPv6 side packet with source (S'1,s1) and destination
   (Pref64::D1,d1) that creates an external mapping to (S1,s1), (D1,d1),
</p>
<p> for any subsequent external connection to from S'1 to (D2,d2)
     within a given binding timer window,
</p>
<p> (S1,s1) = (S2,s2) for all values of D2,d2
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implementations may also provide support for "Address-Dependent
  Mapping" and "Address and Port-Dependent Mapping", as also defined 
	in this document and following the guidelines defined in RFC 4787 
	<a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The security
  properties however are determined by which packets the NAT64 filter
  allows in and which it does not. The security properties are
  determined by the filtering behavior and filtering configuration
  in the filtering portions of the NAT64, not by the address mapping
  behavior. For example,
	</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> Without filtering - When "endpoint independent
  filtering" is used in NAT64, once a binding is created in the
  IPv6 ---> IPv4 direction, packets from any node on the IPv4 side
  destined to the IPv6 transport address will traverse the
  NAT64 gateway and be forwarded to the IPv6 transport address
  that created the binding. However,
</p>
<p>  With filtering - When "endpoint independent
  filtering" is used in NAT64, once a binding is created in the
  IPv6 ---> IPv4 direction, packets from any node on the IPv4 side
  destined to the IPv6 transport address will first be processed
  against the filtering rules. If the source IPv4 address is
  permitted, the packets will be forwarded to the IPv6 transport
  address. If the source IPv4 address is explicitly denied -- or the
  default policy is to deny all addresses not explicitly permitted
  -- then the packet will discarded. A dynamic filter may be
  employed where by the filter will only allow packets from the
  IPv4 address to which the original packet that created the binding
  was sent. This means that only the D IPv4 addresses to which the
  IPv6 host has initiated connections will be able to reach the IPv6
  transport address, and no others. This essentially narrows the
  effective operation of the NAT64 device to a
  "Address Dependent" behavior, though not by its
  mapping behavior, but instead by its filtering behavior.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Attacks to NAT64.
</p>
<p>The NAT64 device itself is a potential victim of different type of
	   attacks.  In particular, the NAT64 can be a victim of DoS attacks.
	   The NAT64 box has a limited number of resources that can be consumed
	   by attackers creating a DoS attack.  The NAT64 has a limited number
	   of IPv4 addresses that it uses to create the bindings.  Even though the
	   NAT64 performs address and port translation, it is possible for an
	   attacker to consume all the IPv4 transport addresses by sending IPv6
	   packets with different source IPv6 transport addresses.  It should be
	   noted that this attack can only be launched from the IPv6 side, since
	   IPv4 packets are not used to create binding state.  DoS attacks can
	   also affect other limited resources available in the NAT64 such as
	   memory or link capacity. For instance, it is possible for an attacker 
	   to launch a DoS attack to the memory of the NAT64 device by sending
	   fragments that the NAT64 will store for a given period.  If the
	   number of fragments is high enough, the memory of the NAT64 could be
	   exhausted.  NAT64 devices should implement proper protection against
	   such attacks, for instance allocating a limited amount of memory for
	   fragmented packet storage.
	
</p>
<p>Avoiding hairpinning loops
</p>
<p>If the IPv6-only client can guess the IPv4 binding address that will be
	created, it can use the IPv6 representation of it as source address for
	creating this binding. Then any packet sent to the binding's IPv4
	address will loop in the NAT64.
</p>
<p>Consider the following example:
</p>
<p>Suppose that the IPv4 pool is 192.0.2.0/24
</p>
<p>Then the IPv6-only client sends this to NAT64:
		</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Source: [Pref64::192.0.2.1]:500
</p>
<p>Destination: whatever
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NAT64 allocates 192.0.2.1:500 as IPv4 binding address.
		Now anything sent to 192.0.2.1:500, be it a hairpinned IPv6 packet or an
		IPv4 packet, will loop.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that it is not hard to guess the IPv4 address that will be allocated.
		First the attacker creates a binding and use e.g.
	STUN to know your external IPv4. New bindings will always have this
	address. Then it uses a source port in the range 1-1023. This will
	increase your chances to 1/512 (since range and parity must be
	preserved). 
</p>
<p>In order to address this vulnerability,  the NAT64 drops IPv6 packets whose source address is in Pref64::/n.

Scenario 1: an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet</h3>

<p>An IPv6 only network basically has IPv6 hosts
				(those that are currently available) and because of different reasons
				including operational simplicity, wants to run those hosts
				in IPv6 only mode, while still providing access to the IPv4 Internet. 
				The scenario is depicted in the picture below.
</p>
<p>
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>                            +----+                  +-------------+
                            |    +------------------+IPv6 Internet+
                            |    |                  +-------------+
  IPv6 host-----------------+ GW |
                            |    |                  +-------------+
                            |    +------------------+IPv4 Internet+
                            +----+                  +-------------+

  |-------------------------public v6-----------------------------|
  |-------public v6---------|NAT|----------public v4--------------|



</pre></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>The proposed NAT64/DNS64 is perfectly suitable for this particular scenario.
					The deployment of the NAT64/DNS64 would be as follows: The NAT64 function
					should be located in the GW device that connects the IPv6 site to the IPv4 Internet. 
					The DNS64 functionality can be placed either in the local recursive DNS server
					or in the local resolver in the hosts.
</p>
<p>The proposed NAT64/DNS64 approach satisfies the requirements of this scenario, 
					in particular because it doesn't require any changes to current IPv6 hosts in the
					site to obtain basic functionality.

<a name="rfc.section.A.2"></a><h3>A.2.&nbsp;
Scenario 3: the IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network </h3>

<p>The scenario of servers using private addresses and being reached from the 
				IPv6 Internet basically includes the cases that for whatever reason the servers
				cannot be upgraded to IPv6 and they even may not have public IPv4 addresses and it would
				be useful to allow IPv6 nodes in the IPv6 Internet to reach those servers. This 
				scenario is depicted in the figure below.
</p>
<p>
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>                                  +----+
IPv6 Host(s)-------(Internet)-----+ GW +------Private IPv4 Servers
                                  +----+

|---------public v6---------------|NAT|------private v4----------|
</pre></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>This scenario can again be perfectly served by the NAT64 approach. In this case
					the NAT64 functionality is placed in the GW device connecting the IPv6 Internet to
					the server's site. In this case, the DNS64 functionality is not required in general since real 
					(i.e. non synthetic) AAAA RRs for the IPv4 servers containing the IPv6 representation of
					the IPv4 address of the servers can be created. See more discussion about this in 
					<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-dns64'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;dns64]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bagnulo, M., Sullivan, A., Matthews, P., and I. Beijnum, &ldquo;DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>
					
</p>
<p>Again, this scenario is satisfied by the NAT64 since it supports the required functionality 
					without requiring changes in the IPv4 servers nor in the IPv6 clients.
