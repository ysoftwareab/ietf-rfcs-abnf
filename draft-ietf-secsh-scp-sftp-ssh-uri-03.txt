Internet-Draft         URI Scheme for SSH and SFTP             June 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to be
   used with the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) [I-D.ietf-secsh-
   filexfer] and Secure Shell (SSH) [I-D.ietf-secsh-architecture]
   protocols.

2.  General Syntax

   A hierarchical URI shall consist of the scheme and the scheme
   specific portion separated by a colon ":" followed by the
   hierarchical part, as discussed in [RFC3986].  This specification
   uses the definitions "port", "host", "scheme", "userinfo", "path-
   empty", "path-abempty" and "authority" from [RFC3986].  This document
   follows the ABNF notation defined in [RFC2234].

2.1  Secure Shell (SSH) URI

   The Secure Shell (SSH) scheme shall consist of the scheme name "ssh"
   followed by a colon ":" followed by hier-part defined in [RFC3986].
   This URL does not designate a data object, but rather an interactive
   service.  The SSH URI ABNF definition follows.


   sshURI        =  "ssh:" hier-part
   hier-part     =  "//" authority ( path-empty / path-abempty )
   authority     =  [ [ userinfo-ssh ] "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
   host          =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   port          =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   userinfo-ssh  =   [ userinfo ] [";" c-param *("," c-param)]
   userinfo      =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   path-empty    =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   path-abempty  =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   c-param       =  paramname "=" paramvalue
   paramname     =  *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / ":" )
   paramvalue    =  *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / ":" )

   The first component of the scheme specific portion MAY include
   credentials (userinfo-ssh) consisting of a username followed by
   optional parameters.  The convention of optionally including the
   password separated from the username by a ":" in the URI is NOT
   RECOMMENDED and is deprecated in accordance with [RFC3986].

   One or more optional connection parameters (conn-parameters) may be
   specified within the userinfo section of the URI.  These conn-
   parameters are separated from the userinfo by a semi-colon ";".  The
   only connection parameter defined in this document is for the host-
   key fingerprint described in section Section 3.1.  It is possible



Salowey & Suehring      Expires December 3, 2005                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         URI Scheme for SSH and SFTP             June 2005


   that additional parameters be defined in the future.  If a connection
   parameter is not understood it SHOULD be ignored.

   If the userinfo or connection parameters are present the at-sign "@"
   shall precede the authority section of the URI.  Optionally, the
   authority section MAY also include the port preceded by a colon ":".
   If the port is not included, the default port is assumed.

2.2  Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) URI

   The SFTP URL scheme is used to designate files and directory listings
   to retrieve on Internet hosts accessible using the SFTP protocol
   described in [I-D.ietf-secsh-filexfer].  For Secure File Transfer
   Protocol (SFTP), the scheme portion shall consist of the scheme name
   "sftp".  SFTP URIs ABNF definition is given below.


   sftpURI       = "sftp:" hier-part
   hier-part    = "//" authority [ path ] [ ";" s-param *("," s-param)]
   path         = <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   authority    = [ userinfo-ssh "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
   host         = <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   port         = <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   userinfo-ssh =  [ userinfo ] [";" c-param *("," c-param)]
   userinfo     = <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   c-param       =  paramname "=" paramvalue
   paramname     =  *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / ":" )
   paramvalue    =  *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / ":" )
   s-param      = paramname "=" paramvalue

   The authority portion of the SFTP URL is the same as for the SSH URL
   defined in section Section 2.1.  The URIs for SFTP are hierarchical
   URIs where each component of the path consists of path elements
   separated by a '/'.  This formatting is meant to represent the path
   information as in Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-secsh-filexfer].  If a path
   starts with a %2F (a URL-encoded "/") then it is relative to the root
   of the file system.  Paths starting with any other character are
   relative to the user's home or default directory.  Note that the
   characters "/" and ";" are reserved and must be encoded.  Path
   segments SHOULD be represented in the UTF-8 [RFC3629] character set
   and clients SHOULD NOT disable UTF-8 translation on the server with
   the filename-translation-control extension.  The shortest valid UTF-8
   encoding of the UNICODE data MUST be used.  Note that dot segments
   "." and ".." are only interpreted within the URI path hierarchy and
   are removes as part of the URL resolution process defined in
   [RFC3986].

   Following the path additional sftp specific parameters may be

   specified.  These are described in section Section 3.2.  It is
   possible that additional parameters be defined in the future.  If a
   sftp parameter is not understood it SHOULD be ignored.

3.  Parameters


3.1   SSH connection parameters

   The following parameters are associated with an SSH connection and
   are applicable to SSH and SFTP.  All parameters are optional and MUST
   NOT overwrite configured defaults.  Individual parameters are
   separated by a comma (",").

   fingerprint

      The fingerprint parameter contains the fingerprint of the host key
      for the host specified in the URL.  The fingerprint is encoded as
      host-key-alg-fingerprint.  Host-key-alg is host public key
      algorithm defined in [I-D.ietf-secsh-transport] and the
      fingerprint format is [I-D.ietf-secsh-publickeyfile].  For use in
      a URI, the fingerprint shall use a single dash "-" as a separator
      instead of the colon ":" as described in [I-D.ietf-secsh-
      publickeyfile].  This parameter MUST NOT overwrite a key that is
      already configured for the host.  The fingerprint MAY be used to
      validate the authenticity of the host key if the URL was obtained
      from an authenticated source with its integrity protected.  If
      this parameter is not included then the validity of the host key
      is validated using another method.  See Security Considerations
      section for additional considerations.  There MUST be only one
      fingerprint parameter per host-key-alg for a given URL.

3.2  SFTP Parameters

   The SFTP parameters determine how to handle the file transfer
   character translation.  Additional parameters MAY be used.

   typecode

      The typecode identifies the type of file which determines how it
      will be treated.  The name for the typecode attribute is "type".
      The value "i" indicates that a file should be transmitted without
      character conversion performed.  The value "a" indicates that the
      file should be opened with the SSH_FXF_ACCESS_TEXT_MODE flag set
      so it is converted to the canonical newline convention in use.
      The value "d" indicates that the path is a directory and should be
      opened using SSH_FXP_OPENDIR.

4.  Examples

   The following section shows basic examples of URLs for each protocol.
   This section should not be considered to include all possible
   combinations of URLs for each protocol.

   An SSH connection to the host host.example.com on the standard port
   using username user.

        ssh://user@host.example.com

   An SSH connection to the host host.example.com on port 2222 using
   username user.

        ssh://user@host.example.com:2222

   An SSH connection to the host having the specified host-key
   fingerprint at host.example.com on the standard port using username
   user.

        ssh://user;fingerprint=ssh-dss-c1-b1-30-29-d7-b8-de-6c-97-
             77-10-d7-46-41-63-87@host.example.com

   Retrieve file.txt from the user's home directory on the host at
   host.example.com using SFTP using username user.

        sftp://user@host.example.com/file.txt

   Retrieve file.txt from the absolute path /dir/path on the host at
   host.example.com using SFTP using username user.

        sftp://user@host.example.com/%2Fdir/path/file.txt

   Retrieve the directory listing of user's home directory on the host
   having the specified host-key fingerprint at host.example.com using
   SFTP.

        sftp://user;fingerprint=ssh-dss-c1-b1-30-29-d7-b8-de-6c-97-
              77-10-d7-46-41-63-87@host.example.com:2222/;type=d

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document provides the information required in the URL
   registration template in accordance with [RFC2717].

6.  Security Considerations

   Passwords SHOULD NOT be included within the URI it should be noted

   that doing so poses a security risk.  Since URIs are usually sent in
   the clear with no encryption or other security, any password or other
   credentials included in the userinfo could be seen by a potential
   attacker.

   Although the host-key fingerprint is not confidential information,
   care must be taken in handling fingerprints associated with URIs
   because URIs transmitted or stored without protection may be modified
   by an attacker.  In general an implementation cannot determine the
   source of a URI so a fingerprint received in a URI should have no
   more trust associated with it than a raw public key received in the
   SSH protocol itself.  If a locally configured key exists for the
   server already it MUST NOT be automatically overwritten with
   information from the URI.  If the host is unknown then the
   implementation should treat the fingerprint received with the same
   caution that it does with any unknown public key.  The client MAY
   offer the fingerprint and URI for external validation before allowing
   a connection based on this information.  If the client chooses to
   make a connection based on the URI information and it finds that the
   public key in the URI and the public key offered by the server do not
   match then it SHOULD provide a warning and provide a means to abort
   the connection.  Sections 4.1 and 9.2.4 of [I-D.ietf-secsh-
   architecture] provide a good discussion of handling public keys
   received in the SSH protocol.
