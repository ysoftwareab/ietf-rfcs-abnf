<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>RFC 3270 defines how to support the Diffserv architecture in MPLS
      networks, including how to encode Diffserv Code Points (DSCPs) in an
      MPLS header. DSCPs may be encoded in the EXP field, while other uses of
      that field are not precluded. RFC3270 makes no statement about how
      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking might be encoded in the
      MPLS header. This draft defines how an operator might define some of the
      EXP codepoints for explicit congestion notification, without precluding
      other uses.

<p>Changes in draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-mpls-01.txt relative to
      draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-mpls-00.txt:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Moved the detailed discussion of marking procedures for
          Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) to an appendix.
</li>
<li>Removed PCN as a motivation for the efficient code-point usage in
          <a class='info' href='#motive'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Use of MPLS EXP Field for ECN</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>Clarified the rationale for preferring the ECT-checking approach

</li>
<li>Removed discussion of re-ECN from Security Considerations.
</li>
<li>Fixed typos and nits.

<p>Changes in draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-mpls-00.txt relative to
      draft-davie-ecn-mpls-00:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Corrected the description of ECN-MPLS marking proposed in <a class='info' href='#Shayman'>[Shayman]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Using ECN to Signal Congestion Within an MPLS Domain,&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, which closely corresponds to that proposed
          in this document.
</li>
<li>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) marking is now described in a
          way that does not require normative references to PCN
          specifications. PCN discussion now serves only to illustrate how the
          ECN marking concepts can be extended to cover more complex
          scenarios, with PCN being an example.
</li>
<li>Added specification of behavior when MPLS encapsulated packets
          cross from an ECN-enabled domain to a domain that is not
          ECN-enabled.
</li>
<li>Clarified that copying MPLS ECN or PCN marking into exposed IP
          header on egress is not mandatory
</li>
<li>Fixed typos and nits
</li>

Background</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> defines Explicit Congestion Notification
        for IP. The primary purpose of ECN is to allow congestion to be
        signalled without dropping packets.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3270'>[RFC3270]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Le Faucheur, F., Wu, L., Davie, B., Davari, S., Vaananen, P., Krishnan, R., Cheval, P., and J. Heinanen, &ldquo;Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> defines how to support the Diffserv
        architecture in MPLS networks, including how to encode Diffserv Code
        Points (DSCPs) in an MPLS header. DSCPs may be encoded in the EXP
        field, while other uses of that field are not precluded. RFC3270 makes
        no statement about how Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking
        might be encoded in the MPLS header.
</p>
<p>This draft defines how an operator might define some of the EXP
        codepoints for explicit congestion notification, without precluding
        other uses. In parallel to the activity defining the addition of ECN
        to IP <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, two proposals were made to add ECN to
        MPLS <a class='info' href='#Floyd'>[Floyd]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;A Proposal to Incorporate ECN in MPLS,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a><a class='info' href='#Shayman'>[Shayman]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Using ECN to Signal Congestion Within an MPLS Domain,&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. These
        proposals, however, fell by the wayside. With ECN for IP now being a
        proposed standard, and developing interest in using pre-congestion
        notification (PCN) for admission control and flow termination <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pcn-architecture'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pcn&#8209;architecture]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eardley, P., &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, there is consequent interest in
        being able to support ECN across IP networks consisting of
        MPLS-enabled domains. Therefore it is necessary to specify the
        protocol for including ECN in the MPLS shim header, and the protocol
        behavior of edge MPLS nodes.
</p>
<p>We note that in <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> there are four codepoints
        used for ECN marking, which are encoded using two bits of the IP
        header. The MPLS EXP field is the logical place to encode ECN
        codepoints, but with only 3 bits (8 codepoints) available, and with
        the same field being used to convey DSCP information as well, there is
        a clear incentive to conserve the number of codepoints consumed for
        ECN purposes. Efficient use of the EXP field has been a focus of prior
        drafts <a class='info' href='#Floyd'>[Floyd]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;A Proposal to Incorporate ECN in MPLS,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#Shayman'>[Shayman]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Using ECN to Signal Congestion Within an MPLS Domain,&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a> and we draw
        on those efforts in this draft as well.

<p>We also note that <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> defines default usage
        of the ECN field but allows for the possibility that some Diffserv
        PHBs might include different specifications on how the ECN field is to
        be used. This draft seeks to preserve that capability.

Intent</h3>

<p>Our intent is to specify how the MPLS shim header <a class='info' href='#RFC3032'>[RFC3032]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, E., Tappan, D., Fedorkow, G., Rekhter, Y., Farinacci, D., Li, T., and A.

        should understand whether the transport for a packet will be ECN
        capable. We offer this as a building block, from which to build
        different congestion notification systems. We do not intend to specify
        how the resulting congestion notification is fed back to an upstream
        node that can mitigate congestion. For instance, unlike <a class='info' href='#Shayman'>[Shayman]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Using ECN to Signal Congestion Within an MPLS Domain,&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, we do not specify edge-to-edge MPLS domain
        feedback, but we also do not preclude it. Nonetheless, we do specify
        how the egress node of an MPLS domain should copy congestion
        notification from the MPLS shim into the encapsulated IP header if the
        ECN is to be carried onward towards the IP receiver. But we do NOT
        mandate that MPLS congestion notification must be copied into the IP
        header for onward transmission. This draft aims to be generic for any
        use of congestion notification in MPLS. Support of <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D.

        reader to the references above for complete specifications of the
        relevant technologies:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>CE: Congestion Experienced. One of the states with which a
            packet may be marked in a network supporting ECN. A packet is
            marked in this state by an ECN-capable router, to indicate that
            this router was experiencing congestion at the time the packet
            arrived.
</li>
<li>ECT: ECN-capable Transport. One of the ECN states which a
            packet may be in when it is sent by an end system. An end system
            marks a packet with an ECT codepoint to indicate that the
            end-points of the transport protocol are ECN-capable. A router may
            not mark a packet as CE unless the packet was marked ECT when it
            arrived.
</li>
<li>Not-ECT: Not ECN capable transport. An end system marks a
            packet with this codepoint to indicate that the end-points of the
            transport protocol are not ECN-capable. A congested router cannot
            mark such packets as CE, and thus can only drop them to indicate
            congestion.

Use of MPLS EXP Field for ECN</h3>

<p>We propose that LSRs configured for explicit congestion notification
      should use the EXP field in the MPLS shim header. However, <a class='info' href='#RFC3270'>[RFC3270]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Le Faucheur, F., Wu, L., Davie, B., Davari, S., Vaananen, P., Krishnan, R., Cheval, P., and J. Heinanen, &ldquo;Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> already defines use of codepoints in the EXP field
      for differentiated services. Although it does not preclude other
      compatible uses of the EXP field, this clearly seems to limit the space
      available for ECN, given the field is only 3 bits (8 codepoints).
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3270'>[RFC3270]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Le Faucheur, F., Wu, L., Davie, B., Davari, S., Vaananen, P., Krishnan, R., Cheval, P., and J. Heinanen, &ldquo;Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> defines two possible approaches for
      requesting differentiated service treatment from an LSR.
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>In the E-LSP approach, different codepoints of the EXP field in
          the MPLS shim header are used to indicate the packet's per hop
          behavior (PHB).
</li>
<li>In the L-LSP approach, an MPLS label is assigned for each PHB
          scheduling class (PSC, as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3260'>[RFC3260]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Grossman, D., &ldquo;New Terminology and Clarifications for Diffserv,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, so
          that an LSR determines both its forwarding and its scheduling
          behavior from the label.
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p>If an MPLS domain uses the L-LSP approach, there is likely to be
      space in the EXP field for ECN codepoint(s). Where the E-LSP approach is
      used, then codepoint space in the EXP field is likely to be scarce. This
      draft focuses on interworking ECN marking with the E-LSP approach as it
      is the tougher problem. Consequently the same approach can also be
      applied with L-LSPs.
</p>
<p>We recommend that explicit congestion notification in MPLS should use
      codepoints instead of bits in the EXP field. Since not every PHB will
      necessarily require an associated ECN codepoint it would be wasteful to
      assign a dedicated bit for ECN. (There may also be cases where a given
      PHB might need more than one ECN-like codepoint; see <a class='info' href='#PCN-eg'>Section&nbsp;9.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>PCN flow admission control and flow termination</span><span>)</span></a> for an example.)
</p>
<p>For each PHB that uses ECN marking, we assume one EXP codepoint will
      be defined meaning not congestion marked (Not-CM), and at least one
      other codepoint will be defined meaning congestion marked (CM).
      Therefore, each PHB that uses ECN marking will consume at least two EXP
      codepoints. But PHBs that do not use ECN marking will only consume
      one.
</p>
<p>Further, we wish to use minimal space in the MPLS shim header to tell
      interior LSRs whether each packet will be received by an ECN-capable
      transport (ECT). Nonetheless, we must ensure that an end-point that
      would not understand an ECN mark will not receive one, otherwise it will
      not be able to respond to congestion as it should. In the past, three
      solutions to this problem have been proposed:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>One possible approach is for congested LSRs to mark the ECN field
          in the underlying IP header at the bottom of the label stack.
          Although many commercial LSRs routinely access the IP header for
          other reasons (ECMP), there are numerous drawbacks to attempting to
          find an IP header beneath an MPLS label stack. Notably, there is the
          challenge of detecting the absence of an IP header when non-IP
          packets are carried on an LSP. Therefore we will not consider this
          approach further.
</li>
<li>In the scheme suggested by <a class='info' href='#Floyd'>[Floyd]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;A Proposal to Incorporate ECN in MPLS,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a> ECT and CE are
          overloaded into one bit, so that a 0 means ECT while a 1 might
          either mean Not-ECT or it might mean CE. A packet that has been
          marked as having experienced congestion upstream, and then is picked
          out for marking at a second congested LSR, will be dropped by the
          second LSR since it cannot determine whether the packet has
          previously experienced congestion or if ECN is not supported by the
          transport. <br />
<br />
 While such an approach seemed
          potentially palatable, we do not recommend it here for the following
          reasons. In some cases we wish to be able to use ECN marking long
          before actual congestion (e.g. pre-congestion notification). In
          these circumstances, marking rates at each LSR might be
          non-negligible most of the time, so the chances of a previously
          marked packet encountering an LSR that wants to mark it again will
          also be non-negligible. In the case where CE and not-ECT are
          indistinguishable to core routers, such a scenario could lead to
          unacceptable drop rates. If the typical marking rate at every router
          or LSR is p, and the typical diameter of the network of LSRs is d,
          then the probability that a marked packet will be chosen for marking
          more than once is 1-[Pr(never marked) + Pr(marked at exactly one
          hop)] = 1- [(1-p)^d + dp(1-p)^(d-1)]. For instance, with 6 LSRs in a
          row, each marking ECN with 1% probability, the chances of a packet
          that is already marked being chosen for marking a second time is
          0.15%. The bit overloading scheme would therefore introduce a drop
          rate of 0.15% unnecessarily. Given that most modern core networks
          are sized to introduce near-zero packet drop, it may be unacceptable
          to drop over one in a thousand packets unnecessarily.
</li>
<li>A third possible approach was suggested by <a class='info' href='#Shayman'>[Shayman]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Using ECN to Signal Congestion Within an MPLS Domain,&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. In this scheme, interior LSRs assume that the
          endpoints are ECN-capable, but this assumption is checked when the
          final label is popped. If an interior LSR has marked ECN in the EXP
          field of the shim header, but the IP header says the endpoints are
          not ECN capable, the edge router (or penultimate router, if using
          penultimate hop popping) drops the packet. We recommend this scheme,
          which we call `per-domain ECT checking', and define it more
          precisely in the following section. Its chief drawback is that it
          can cause packets to be forwarded after encountering congestion only
          to be dropped at the egress of the MPLS domain. The rationale for
          this decision is given in <a class='info' href='#non-ecn-mark'>Section&nbsp;8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Marking non-ECN Capable Packets</span><span>)</span></a>.

Per-domain ECT checking</h3>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we define the egress nodes of an
      MPLS domain as the nodes that pop the last MPLS label from the label
      stack, exposing the IP (or, potentially non-IP) header. Note that such a
      node may be the ultimate or penultimate hop of an LSP, depending on
      whether penultimate hop popping (PHP) is employed.
</p>
<p>In the per-domain ECT checking approach, the egress nodes take
      responsibility for checking whether the transport is ECN capable. This
      draft does not specify how these nodes should pass on congestion
      notification, because different approaches are likely in different
      scenarios. However, if congestion notification in the MPLS header is
      copied into the IP header, the procedure MUST conform to the
      specification given here.
</p>
<p>If congestion notification is passed to the transport without first
      passing it onward in the IP header, the approach used must take similar
      care to check that the transport is ECN capable before passing it ECN
      markings. Specifically, if the transport for a particular congestion
      marked MPLS packet is found not to be ECN-capable, the packet MUST be
      dropped at this egress node.
</p>
<p>In the per-domain ECT checking approach, only the egress nodes check
      whether an IP packet is destined for an ECN-capable transport.
      Therefore, any single LSR within an MPLS domain MUST NOT be configured
      to enable ECN marking unless all the egress LSRs surrounding it are
      already configured to handle ECN marking.
</p>
<p>We call a domain surrounded by ECN-capable egress LSRs an ECN-enabled
      MPLS domain. This term only implies that all the egress LSRs are
      ECN-enabled; some interior LSRs may not be ECN-enabled. For instance, it
      would be possible to use some legacy LSRs incapable of supporting ECN in
      the interior of an MPLS domain as long as all the egress LSRs were
      ECN-capable. Note that if PHP is used, the "penultimate hop" routers
      which perform the pop operation do need to be ECN-enabled, since they
      are acting in this context as egress LSRs.

Crossing a Diffserv Domain Boundary</h3>

<p>If an MPLS-encapsulated packet crosses a Diffserv domain boundary,
        it may be the case that the two domains use different encodings of the
        same PHB in the EXP field. In such cases, the EXP field must be
        rewritten at the domain boundary. If the PHB is one that supports ECN,
        then the appropriate ECN marking should also be preserved when the EXP
        field is mapped at the boundary.
</p>
<p>If an MPLS-encapsulated packet that is in the CM state crosses from
        a domain that is ECN-enabled (as defined in <a class='info' href='#ect-domain'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Per-domain ECT checking</span><span>)</span></a>) to a domain that is not ECN-enabled, then it
        is necessary to perform the egress checking procedures at the egress
        LSR of the ECN-enabled domain. This means that if the encapsulated
        packet is not ECN capable, the packet MUST be dropped. Note that this
        implies the egress LSR must be able to look beneath the MPLS header
        without popping the label stack.

        information should be transferred from the outer EXP field to the

        Not-CM, the inner EXP field is set to the same CM or Not-CM state as
        the outer EXP field. If the inner EXP field is CM, it remains
        unchanged whatever the outer EXP field. Note that an inner value of CM
        and an outer value of not-CM should be considered anomalous, and

<a name="rfc.section.4.6"></a><h3>4.6.&nbsp;
Popping the last MPLS label in the stack</h3>

<p>When the last MPLS label is popped from the packet, its payload is
        exposed. If that packet is not IP, and does not have any capability
        equivalent to ECT, it is assumed Not-ECT and treated as such. That
        means that if the EXP value of the MPLS header was CM, the packet MUST
        be dropped.
</p>
<p>Assuming an IP packet was exposed, we have to examine whether that
        packet is ECT or not. A Not-ECT packet MUST be dropped if the EXP
        field is CM.
</p>
<p>For the remainder of this section, we describe the behavior that is
        required if the ECN information is to be transferred from the MPLS
        header into the exposed IP header for onward transmission. As noted in
        <a class='info' href='#intent'>Section&nbsp;1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Intent</span><span>)</span></a>, such behavior is not mandated by this
        document, but may be selected by an operator.
</p>
<p>If the inner IP packet is Not-ECT, its ECN field remains unchanged
        if the EXP field is Not-CM. If the ECN field of the inner packet is
        set to ECT(0), ECT(1) or CE, the ECN field remains unchanged if the
        EXP field is set to Not-CM. The ECN field is set to CE if the EXP
        field is CM. Note that an inner value of CE and an outer value of
        not-CM should be considered anomalous, and SHOULD be logged in some
        way by the LSR.

        Diffserv support across MPLS Domains, referred to as the uniform,

        in whether the Diffserv treatment that applies to a packet while it

        and beyond the last hop. Depending on which mode is preferred by an

        ECN marking, the use of these models should only apply to the encoding
        of the Diffserv PHB in the EXP value, and that the choice of codepoint
        for ECN should always be made based on the procedures described above,
        independent of the tunneling model.

ECN-disabled MPLS domain</h3>

<p>If ECN is not enabled on all the egress LSRs of a domain, ECN MUST
      NOT be enabled on any LSRs throughout the domain. If congestion is
      experienced on any LSR in an ECN-disabled MPLS domain, packets MUST be
      dropped, NOT marked. The exact algorithm for deciding when to drop
      packets during congestion (e.g. tail-drop, RED, etc.) is a local matter

      L-LSPs and some of those could potentially provide ample EXP codepoints
      for ECN. However, deploying L-LSPs vs E-LSPs has many implications such
      as platform support and operational complexity. The above ECN MPLS
      solution should provide some flexibility. If the operator has deployed
      one L-LSP per PHB scheduling class, then EXP space will be a non-issue
      and it could be used to achieve more sophisticated ECN behavior if
      required. If the operator wants to stick to E-LSPs and uses a handful of
      EXP codepoints for Diffserv, it may be desirable to operate with a
      minimum number of extra ECN codepoints, even if this comes with some
      compromise on ECN optimality. See <a class='info' href='#examples'>Section&nbsp;9<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example Uses</span><span>)</span></a> for
      discussion of some possible deployment scenarios.
</p>
<p>We note that in a network where L-LSPs are used, ECN marking SHOULD
      NOT cause packets from the same microflow but with different ECN
      markings to be sent on different LSPs. As discussed in <a class='info' href='#RFC3270'>[RFC3270]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Le Faucheur, F., Wu, L., Davie, B., Davari, S., Vaananen, P., Krishnan, R., Cheval, P., and J.

      on the same LSP to avoid possible misordering. Thus, ECN marking of

Relationship to tunnel behavior in RFC 3168</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> defines two modes of encapsulating
      ECN-marked IP packets inside additional IP headers when tunnels are
      used. The two modes are the "full functionality" and "limited
      functionality" modes. In the full functionality mode, the ECT
      information from the inner header is copied to the outer header at the
      tunnel ingress, but the CE information is not. In the limited
      functionality mode, neither ECT nor CE information is copied to the
      outer header, and thus ECN cannot be applied to the encapsulated
      packet.
</p>
<p>The behavior that is specified in <a class='info' href='#ecn-spec'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>ECN-enabled MPLS domain</span><span>)</span></a> of this
      document resembles the "full functionality" mode in the sense that it
      conveys some information from inner to outer header, and in the sense
      that it enables full ECN support along the MPLS LSP (which is analogous
      to an IP tunnel in this context). However it differs in one respect,
      which is that the CE information is conveyed from the inner header to
      the outer header. Our original reason for this different design choice
      was to give interior routers and LSRs more information about upstream
      marking in multi-bottleneck cases. For instance, the flow termination
      marking mechanism proposed for PCN works by only considering packets for
      marking that have not already been marked upstream. Unless existing flow
      termination marking is copied from the inner to the outer header at
      tunnel ingress, the mechanism doesn't terminate enough traffic in cases
      where anomalous events hit multiple domains at once. <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> does not give any reasons against conveying CE
      information from the inner header to the outer in the "full
      functionality" mode. Furthermore, <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>[RFC4301]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> specifies
      that the ECN marking should be copied from inner header to outer header
      in IPSEC tunnels, consistent with the approach defined here. <a class='info' href='#I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel'>[I&#8209;D.briscoe&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;ecn&#8209;tunnel]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;Layered Encapsulation of Congestion Notification,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> discusses this issue in more

Marking non-ECN Capable Packets</h3>

<p>What are the consequences of marking a packet that is not
        ECN-capable? Even if it will be dropped before leaving the domain,
        doesn't this consume resources unnecessarily?
</p>
<p>The problem only arises if there is congestion downstream of an
        earlier congested queue in the same MPLS domain. Downstream congested
        LSRs might forward packets already marked, even though they will be
        dropped later when the inner IP header is found to be Not-ECT on
        decapsulation. Such packets might cause the downstream LSRs to mark
        (or drop) other packets that they would otherwise not have had to.
</p>
<p>We expect congestion will typically be rare in MPLS networks, but
        it might not be. The extra unnecessary load at downstream LSRs will
        not be more than the fraction of marked packets from upstream LSRs,
        even in the worst case where no transports are ECN capable. Therefore
        the amount of unnecessary marking (or drop) on an LSR will not be more
        than the product of its local marking rate and the marking rate due to
        upstream LSRs within the same domain - typically the product of two
        small (often zero) probabilities.
</p>
<p>This is why we decided to use the per-domain ECT checking approach
        - because the most likely effect would be a very slightly increased
        marking rate, which would result in very slightly higher drop only for
        non-ECN-capable transports. We chose not to use the <a class='info' href='#Floyd'>[Floyd]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;A Proposal to Incorporate ECN in MPLS,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a> alternative which introduced a low but persistent
        level of unnecessary packet drop for all time, even for ECN-capable
        transports. Although that scheme did not carry traffic to the edge of
        the MPLS domain only to be dropped on decapsulation, we felt our minor
        inefficiency was a small price to pay. And it would get smaller still
        if ECN deployment widened.
</p>
<p>A partial solution would be to preferentially drop packets arriving
        at a congested router that were already marked. There is no solution
        to the problem of marking a packet when congestion is caused by
        another packet that should have been dropped. However, the chance of
        such an occurrence is very low and the consequences are not
        significant. It merely causes an application to very occasionally slow
        down its rate when it did not have to.

Non-ECN capable routers in an MPLS Domain</h3>

<p>What if an MPLS domain wants to use ECN, but not all legacy routers
        are able to support it?
</p>
<p>If the legacy router(s) are used in the interior, this is not a
        problem. They will simply have to drop the packets if they are
        congested, rather than mark them, which is the standard behavior for
        IP routers that are not ECN-enabled.
</p>
<p>If the legacy router were used as an egress router, it would not be
        able to check the ECN capability of the transport correctly. An
        operator in this position would not be able to use this solution and
        therefore MUST NOT enable ECN unless all egress routers are
        ECN-capable.

        introduces the use of ECN-Echo and CWR flags in the TCP header for

        increasing the congestion window) when it receives an ECN-Echo (ECE)
        ACK packet (that is, an ACK packet with ECN-Echo flag set in the TCP
        header), then the sender knows that congestion was encountered in the
        network on the path from the sender to the receiver.
</p>
<p>It would be possible to enable ECN in an MPLS domain for Diffserv

ECN Co-existence with Diffserv E-LSPs</h3>

<p>Many operators today have deployed Diffserv using the E-LSP

Heinanen, &ldquo;Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. In many cases the number of
        PHBs used is less than 8, and hence there remain available codepoints
        in the EXP space. If an operator wished to support ECN for single PHB,
        this can be accomplished by simply allocated a second codepoint to the
        PHB for the "CM" state of that PHB and retaining the old codepoint for
        the "not-CM" state. An operator with only four deployed PHBs could of
        course enable ECN marking on all those PHBs. It is easy to imagine
        cases where some PHBs might benefit more from ECN than others - for
        example, an operator might use ECN on a premium data service but not
        on a PHB used for best effort internet traffic.
</p>
<p>As an illustrative example of how the EXP field might be used in
        this case, consider the example of an operator who is using the
        aggregated service classes proposed in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tsvwg-diffserv-class-aggr'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;diffserv&#8209;class&#8209;aggr]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chan, K., Babiarz, J., and F. Baker, &ldquo;Aggregation of DiffServ Service Classes,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. He may choose to
        support ECN only for the Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate, using
        the EXP codepoint 010 for the not-CM state and 011 for the CM state.
        All other codepoints could be the same as in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tsvwg-diffserv-class-aggr'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;diffserv&#8209;class&#8209;aggr]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chan, K., Babiarz, J., and F.

        combination of EXP values can be used according to the specific set of
        PHBs and marking conventions used within that operator's network.

Congestion-feedback-based Traffic Engineering</h3>

        another example application of ECN feedback in an MPLS domain. Shayman
        proposed the use of ECN by an egress LSR feeding back congestion to an

        engineering techniques such as shifting flows to an alternate path. It
        proposed a new RSVP message which was sent by the egress LSR to the
        ingress LSR (and ignored by transit LSRs) to indicate congestion along
        the path. Thus, rather than providing the same style of congestion
        notification to endpoints as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>,

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>We believe no new vulnerabilities are introduced by this draft.
</p>
<p>We have considered whether malicious sources might be able to exploit
      the fact that interior LSRs will mark packets that are Not-ECT, relying
      on their egress LSR to drop them. Although this might allow sources to
      engineer a situation where more traffic is carried across an MPLS domain
      than should be, we figured that even if we hadn't introduced this
      feature, these sources would have been able to prevent these LSRs
      dropping this traffic anyway, simply by setting ECT in the first
      place.
</p>
<p>An ECN sender can use the ECN nonce <a class='info' href='#RFC3540'>[RFC3540]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Spring, N., Wetherall, D., and D. Ely, &ldquo;Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling with Nonces,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> to
      detect a misbehaving receiver. The ECN nonce works correctly across an
      MPLS domain without requiring any specific support from the proposal in
      this draft. The nonce does not need to be present in the MPLS shim
      header. As long as the nonce is present in the IP header when the ECN
      information is copied from the last MPLS shim header, it will be
      overwritten if congestion has been experienced by an LSR. This is all
      that is necessary for the sender to detect a misbehaving receiver.

Extension to Pre-Congestion Notification</h3>

<p>This appendix describes how the mechanisms decribed in the body of
      the document can be extended to support PCN <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pcn-architecture'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pcn&#8209;architecture]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eardley, P., &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Our intent here is to show that
      the mechanisms are readily extended to more complex scenarios than ECN,
      particulary in the case where more codepoints are needed, but this
      appendix may be safely ignored if one is interested only in supporting
      ECN. Note that the PCN standards are still very much under development
      at the time of writing, hence the precise details contained in this
      appendix may be subject to change, and we stress that this appendix is
      for illustrative purposes only.
</p>
<p>The relevant aspects of PCN for the purposes of this discussion
      are:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>PCN uses 3 states rather than 2 for ECN - these are referred to
          as admission marked (AM), termination marked (TM) and not marked
          (NM) states. (See <a class='info' href='#PCN-eg'>Section&nbsp;9.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>PCN flow admission control and flow termination</span><span>)</span></a> for further discussion of
          PCN and the possibility of using fewer codepoints.)
</li>
<li>A packet can go from NM to AM, from NM to TM, or from AM to TM,
          but no other transition is possible.
</li>
<li>The determination of whether a packet is subject to PCN is based
          on the PHB of the packet.
</li>

<p>Thus, to support PCN fully in an MPLS domain for a particular PHB, a
      total of 3 codepoints need to be allocated for that PHB. These 3
      codepoints represent the admission marked (AM), termination marked (TM)
      and not marked (NM) states. The procedures described in <a class='info' href='#ecn-spec'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>ECN-enabled MPLS domain</span><span>)</span></a> above need to be slightly modified to support this
      scenario. The following procedures are invoked when the topmost DSCP or
      EXP value indicates a PHB that supports PCN.

        should set the EXP value in the MPLS header to the AM (or TM)

            logged in some way and the inner EXP value should be
            unchanged.
</li>
<li>If the inner EXP value is TM, it should be unchanged whatever

Popping the last MPLS Label to expose IP header</h3>

<p>When popping the last MPLS Label exposes the IP header, there are
        two cases to consider:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the popping LSR is NOT the egress router of the PCN region, in
            which case AM or TM marking should be transferred to the exposed
            IP header field; or
</li>
<li>the popping LSR IS the egress router of the PCN region.
</li>
</ul><p>In the latter case, the behavior of the egress LSR is defined
        in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pcn-architecture'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pcn&#8209;architecture]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eardley, P., &ldquo;Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and is beyond the scope
        of this document. In the former case, the marking should be
        transferred from the popped MPLS header to the exposed IP header as
        follows:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the inner IP header value is neither AM nor TM, and the EXP
            value was NM, then the IP header should be unchanged. For any
            other EXP value, the IP header should be set to the same marking
            state as the EXP value of the popped label stack entry.
</li>
<li>If the inner IP header value is AM, it should be unchanged if
            the popped EXP value was AM, and it should be set to TM if the
            popped EXP value was TM. If the popped EXP value was NM, this
            should be logged in some way and the inner IP header value should
            be unchanged.
</li>
<li>If the IP header value is TM, it should be unchanged whatever
            the popped EXP value was, but any EXP value other than TM should
            be logged.
