Abstract

   This document describes a problem of source address selection Rule 8.
   stated in RFC3484[1], and shows one solution, which is based just on
   the destination based address routing and does not require policy
   routing such as source address based routing.

Internet-Draft      Source Address Selection for IPv6          July 2007


1. A Problem of at Source Address Selection Rule 8. in RFC3484

   In RFC3484[1], the source address selection guidelines are shown in
   the case of multihoming.  However, according to them, a problem
   occurs that a host cannot select the best path.

   Rule 8 in 5. Source Address Selection in RFC3484 says:

      Rule 8: Use longest matching prefix.  If CommonPrefixLen(SA, D) >
      CommonPrefixLen(SB, D), then prefer SA. Similarly, if
      CommonPrefixLen(SB, D) > CommonPrefixLen(SA,D), then prefer SB.

   Here, consider a network shown in Fig. 1.

      - Each of ISP1, ISP2, and ISP3 is assigned an address space,
        2001:db8:1000::/36, 2001:db8:2000::/36, and 2001:db8:3000::/36,
        respectively.

      - Correspondent node CN belongs to ISP2, and is assigned an
      address
        2001:db8:2001::CN.

      - Router R is multihomed to ISP1 and ISP3, and distributes address
        spaces to downstream nodes such as 2001:db8:1001::/48 and
        2001:db8:3001::/48.

      - End node EN is assigned two addresses, 2001:db8:1001:1:EN and
        2001:db8:3001:1:EN.

   Here, in the above IPv6 address notation, CN, R, and EN indicates
   64bit Interface ID's.


   According to Rule 8, by means of the longest match method,
   2001:db8:3001:EN is selected as the source address of a packet
   directed from CN to EN.  Therefore,

   - For the purpose of avoiding the source address filtering,
     policy routing or etc. is required in order to direct a packet to
     ISP3.

   - The route becomes roundabout passing through ISP3.


2. A Solution Using Just the Information of the Destination Address of
   Packets


   Here, the solution of the above problem is shown, which is based on
   the ordinal destination address based routing, that is, does not
   require policy routing such as source address based routing.  This
   solution requires management and implementation elaborations.

   First, mange a network shown in Fig. 2. Here:

      - The downstream interface of router R is assigned both addresses
        2001:db8:1001:R and 2001:db8:3001:R.
        This is required even if R has only a single downstream link.

      - Each of R and EN keeps the routing table shown in Fig. 2,
        respectively.
        The next hop becomes different according to a destination
        address, even when a single upstream router exists.


2.2 Implementation Elaboration


   When an entry of a routing table is hit, a source address is selected
   which longest-matches the next hop in the entry.

   In the above example, on end node EN, when the entry "2001:2::/32
   2001:db8:1001:1:R" is hit for the destination "2001:db8:2001::CN",
   the next hop becomes "2001:db8:1001::R", as a result, the address
   "2001:db8:1001:1:EN" is selected, because it longest-matches the next
   hop.


2.3 Summary of This Method


   This method is summarized as follows:

      - When a router multihomes and is assigned multiple address
        spaces, it assigns multiple addresses to downstream interfaces.
        This is required when it has only a sigle downstream interface.

      - An end host has a routing table in which the next hops differs
        from each other when the selected route may becomes different,
        even when the next hop routers are the same.

      - An implementation is required that when an entry in a routing
        table is hit, a source address is selected from the interface
        addresses, which longest-matches the next hop.

      Note that the method of distributing routing information that
      configures the routing tables mentioned in this document, is out
      of the scope of this document. Some intra-domain routing protocol
      may be adaptable.
