2.  Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
(MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
managing the the interface attributes defined in the
Guaranteed Service of the Integrated Services Model.  Comments

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
components.  They are:

o    RFC 1441 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of
     management.

o    RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
     architectural aspects of the framework.

o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
     access to managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
purpose of experimentation and evaluation.


3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively
assigned name.  The object type together with an object
instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.


4.  Overview

4.1.  Textual Conventions

Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention
in this MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the
readability of the specification and can ease comparison with
other specifications if appropriate.  It should be noted that
the introduction of the these textual conventions has no
effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed

objects.  The use of these is merely an artifact of the
explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of one of
these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or
the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual
conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of
readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear,
concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

           "The Backlog  parameter  is  the  data  backlog
           resulting  from  the vagaries of how a specific
           implementation deviates from a  strict  bit-by-
           bit  service.  So, for instance, for packetized
           weighted fair queueing, Backlog is set  to  the
           Maximum Packet Size.

           The Backlog term is measured in units of bytes.
           An  individual  element can advertise a Backlog
           value between 1 and 2**28 (a  little  over  250
           megabytes)  and  the  total added over all ele-
           ments can range as high as  (2**32)-1.   Should
           the  sum of the different elements delay exceed
           (2**32)-1, the end-to-end error term should  be
           (2**32)-1."

    intSrvGuaranteedIfDelay OBJECT-TYPE
        SYNTAX      INTEGER (0..'0FFFFFFF'h)
        UNITS       "microseconds"
        MAX-ACCESS  read-create
        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
           "The Delay parameter at  each  service  element
           should  be  set  to the maximum packet transfer
           delay (independent of bucket size) through  the
           service  element.   For  instance,  in a simple
           router, one might compute the worst case amount
           of  time  it  make  take  for a datagram to get
           through the input interface to  the  processor,
           and how long it would take to get from the pro-
           cessor to the outbound interface (assuming  the
           queueing  schemes work correctly).  For an Eth-
           ernet, it might represent the worst case  delay
           if  the maximum number of collisions is experi-
           enced.

           The Delay term is measured in units of one  mi-
           crosecond.  An individual element can advertise
           a delay value between  1  and  2**28  (somewhat
           over two minutes) and the total delay added all
           elements  can  range  as  high  as   (2**32)-1.
           Should  the sum of the different elements delay
           exceed (2**32)-1, the end-to-end  delay  should
           be (2**32)-1."

    intSrvGuaranteedIfSlack OBJECT-TYPE
        SYNTAX      INTEGER (0..'0FFFFFFF'h)
        MAX-ACCESS  read-create
        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
           "If a network element uses a certain amount  of
           slack,  Si,  to  reduce the amount of resources
           that it has reserved for a particular flow,  i,
           the  value  Si  should be stored at the network
           element.   Subsequently,  if  reservation   re-
           freshes  are  received  for flow i, the network
           element must use the same slack Si without  any
           further computation. This guarantees consisten-
           cy in the reservation process.

           As an example for the use of  the  slack  term,
           consider the case where the required end-to-end
           delay, Dreq, is larger than the  maximum  delay
           of the fluid flow system.  In this, Ctot is the
           sum of the Backlog terms end to end,  and  Dtot
           is the sum of the delay terms end to end.  Dreq
           is obtained by setting R=r in the  fluid  delay
           formula, and is given by

                        b/r + Ctot/r + Dtot.

           In this case the slack term is

                  S = Dreq - (b/r + Ctot/r + Dtot).

           The slack term may be used by the network  ele-
           ments  to  adjust  their local reservations, so
           that they can admit flows that would  otherwise
           have been rejected. A service element at an in-
           termediate network element that can  internally
           differentiate between delay and rate guarantees
           can now take advantage of this  information  to
           lower the amount of resources allocated to this
           flow. For example, by taking an amount of slack
           s  <= S, an RCSD scheduler [5] can increase the
           local delay bound, d, assigned to the flow,  to
           d+s. Given an RSpec, (Rin, Sin), it would do so
           by setting Rout = Rin and Sout = Sin - s.

           Similarly,  a  network  element  using  a   WFQ

           scheduler  can  decrease  its local reservation
           from Rin to Rout by using some of the slack  in
           the  RSpec.  This  can be accomplished by using
           the transformation rules given in the  previous
           section,  that ensure that the reduced reserva-
           tion level will not increase the  overall  end-
           to-end delay."
