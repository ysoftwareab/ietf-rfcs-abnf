                     Hybrid key exchange in TLS 1.3
                    draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-04

Abstract

   Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms
   simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing
   security even if all but one of the component algorithms is broken.
   It is motivated by transition to post-quantum cryptography.  This
   document provides a construction for hybrid key exchange in the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3.

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the TLS IETF
   mailing list tls@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains
   the draft: https://github.com/dstebila/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design.

1.  Introduction

   This document gives a construction for hybrid key exchange in TLS
   1.3.  The overall design approach is a simple, "concatenation"-based
   approach: each hybrid key exchange combination should be viewed as a
   single new key exchange method, negotiated and transmitted using the
   existing TLS 1.3 mechanisms.

   This document does not propose specific post-quantum mechanisms; see
   Section 1.4 for more on the scope of this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   For the purposes of this document, it is helpful to be able to divide
   cryptographic algorithms into two classes:

   *  "Traditional" algorithms: Algorithms which are widely deployed
      today, but which may be deprecated in the future.  In the context
      of TLS 1.3 in 2019, examples of traditional key exchange
      algorithms include elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman using secp256r1
      or x25519, or finite-field Diffie-Hellman.

   *  "Next-generation" (or "next-gen") algorithms: Algorithms which are
      not yet widely deployed, but which may eventually be widely
      deployed.  An additional facet of these algorithms may be that we
      have less confidence in their security due to them being
      relatively new or less studied.  This includes "post-quantum"
      algorithms.

   "Hybrid" key exchange, in this context, means the use of two (or
   more) key exchange algorithms based on different cryptographic
   assumptions, e.g., one traditional algorithm and one next-gen
   algorithm, with the purpose of the final session key being secure as
   long as at least one of the component key exchange algorithms remains
   unbroken.  We use the term "component" algorithms to refer to the
   algorithms combined in a hybrid key exchange.

   We note that some authors prefer the phrase "composite" to refer to
   the use of multiple algorithms, to distinguish from "hybrid public
   key encryption" in which a key encapsulation mechanism and data
   encapsulation mechanism are combined to create public key encryption.

   The primary motivation of this document is preparing for post-quantum
   algorithms.  However, it is possible that public key cryptography
   based on alternative mathematical constructions will be required
   independent of the advent of a quantum computer, for example because
   of a cryptanalytic breakthrough.  As such we opt for the more generic
   term "next-generation" algorithms rather than exclusively "post-
   quantum" algorithms.

Internet-Draft           ietf-tls-hybrid-design             January 2022


   Note that TLS 1.3 uses the phrase "groups" to refer to key exchange
   algorithms - for example, the supported_groups extension - since all
   key exchange algorithms in TLS 1.3 are Diffie-Hellman-based.  As a
   result, some parts of this document will refer to data structures or
   messages with the term "group" in them despite using a key exchange
   algorithm that is not Diffie-Hellman-based nor a group.

1.3.  Motivation for use of hybrid key exchange

   A hybrid key exchange algorithm allows early adopters eager for post-
   quantum security to have the potential of post-quantum security
   (possibly from a less-well-studied algorithm) while still retaining
   at least the security currently offered by traditional algorithms.
   They may even need to retain traditional algorithms due to regulatory
   constraints, for example FIPS compliance.

   Ideally, one would not use hybrid key exchange: one would have
   confidence in a single algorithm and parameterization that will stand
   the test of time.  However, this may not be the case in the face of
   quantum computers and cryptanalytic advances more generally.

   Many (though not all) post-quantum algorithms currently under
   consideration are relatively new; they have not been subject to the
   same depth of study as RSA and finite-field or elliptic curve Diffie-
   Hellman, and thus the security community does not necessarily have as
   much confidence in their fundamental security, or the concrete
   security level of specific parameterizations.

   Moreover, it is possible that after next-generation algorithms are
   defined, and for a period of time thereafter, conservative users may
   not have full confidence in some algorithms.

   Some users may want to accelerate adoption of post-quantum
   cryptography due the threat of retroactive decryption: if a
   cryptographic assumption is broken due to the advent of a quantum
   computer or some other cryptanalytic breakthrough, confidentiality of
   information can be broken retroactively by any adversary who has
   passively recorded handshakes and encrypted communications.  Hybrid
   key exchange enables potential security against retroactive
   decryption while not fully abandoning classical cryptosystems.

   As such, there may be users for whom hybrid key exchange is an
   appropriate step prior to an eventual transition to next-generation
   algorithms.

1.4.  Scope

   This document focuses on hybrid ephemeral key exchange in TLS 1.3
   [TLS13].  It intentionally does not address:

   *  Selecting which next-generation algorithms to use in TLS 1.3, or
      algorithm identifiers or encoding mechanisms for next-generation
      algorithms.  This selection will be based on the recommendations
      by the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG), which is currently
      waiting for the results of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
      Standardization Project [NIST].

   *  Authentication using next-generation algorithms.  While quantum
      computers could retroactively decrypt previous sessions, session
      authentication cannot be retroactively broken.

1.5.  Goals

   The primary goal of a hybrid key exchange mechanism is to facilitate
   the establishment of a shared secret which remains secure as long as
   as one of the component key exchange mechanisms remains unbroken.

   In addition to the primary cryptographic goal, there may be several
   additional goals in the context of TLS 1.3:

   *  *Backwards compatibility:* Clients and servers who are "hybrid-
      aware", i.e., compliant with whatever hybrid key exchange standard
      is developed for TLS, should remain compatible with endpoints and
      middle-boxes that are not hybrid-aware.  The three scenarios to
      consider are:

      1.  Hybrid-aware client, hybrid-aware server: These parties should
          establish a hybrid shared secret.

      2.  Hybrid-aware client, non-hybrid-aware server: These parties
          should establish a traditional shared secret (assuming the
          hybrid-aware client is willing to downgrade to traditional-
          only).

      3.  Non-hybrid-aware client, hybrid-aware server: These parties
          should establish a traditional shared secret (assuming the
          hybrid-aware server is willing to downgrade to traditional-
          only).

      Ideally backwards compatibility should be achieved without extra
      round trips and without sending duplicate information; see below.

Internet-Draft           ietf-tls-hybrid-design             January 2022


   *  *High performance:* Use of hybrid key exchange should not be
      prohibitively expensive in terms of computational performance.  In
      general this will depend on the performance characteristics of the
      specific cryptographic algorithms used, and as such is outside the
      scope of this document.  See [PST] for preliminary results about
      performance characteristics.

   *  *Low latency:* Use of hybrid key exchange should not substantially
      increase the latency experienced to establish a connection.
      Factors affecting this may include the following.

      -  The computational performance characteristics of the specific
         algorithms used.  See above.

      -  The size of messages to be transmitted.  Public key and
         ciphertext sizes for post-quantum algorithms range from
         hundreds of bytes to over one hundred kilobytes, so this impact
         can be substantial.  See [PST] for preliminary results in a
         laboratory setting, and [LANGLEY] for preliminary results on
         more realistic networks.

      -  Additional round trips added to the protocol.  See below.

   *  *No extra round trips:* Attempting to negotiate hybrid key
      exchange should not lead to extra round trips in any of the three
      hybrid-aware/non-hybrid-aware scenarios listed above.

   *  *Minimal duplicate information:* Attempting to negotiate hybrid
      key exchange should not mean having to send multiple public keys
      of the same type.

2.  Key encapsulation mechanisms

   This document models key agreement as key encapsulation mechanisms
   (KEMs), which consist of three algorithms:

   *  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk.

   *  Encaps(pk) -> (ct, ss): A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key pk and outputs a ciphertext ct
      and shared secret ss.

   *  Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key sk and ciphertext ct and outputs a shared
      secret ss, or in some cases a distinguished error value.

Internet-Draft           ietf-tls-hybrid-design             January 2022


   The main security property for KEMs is indistinguishability under
   adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2), which means that shared
   secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings even
   given the ability to have other arbitrary ciphertexts decapsulated.
   IND-CCA2 corresponds to security against an active attacker, and the
   public key / secret key pair can be treated as a long-term key or
   reused.  A common design pattern for obtaining security under key
   reuse is to apply the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform [FO] or a
   variant thereof [HHK].

   A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under chosen
   plaintext attack (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret values
   should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy of the
   public key.  IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a
   passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.

   Key exchange in TLS 1.3 is phrased in terms of Diffie-Hellman key
   exchange in a group.  DH key exchange can be modeled as a KEM, with
   KeyGen corresponding to selecting an exponent x as the secret key and
   computing the public key g^x; encapsulation corresponding to
   selecting an exponent y, computing the ciphertext g^y and the shared
   secret g^(xy), and decapsulation as computing the shared secret
   g^(xy).  See [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke] for more details of such Diffie-
   Hellman-based key encapsulation mechanisms.

   TLS 1.3 does not require that ephemeral public keys be used only in a
   single key exchange session; some implementations may reuse them, at
   the cost of limited forward secrecy.  As a result, any KEM used in
   the manner described in this document MUST explicitly be designed to
   be secure in the event that the public key is reused, such as
   achieving IND-CCA2 security or having a transform like the Fujisaki-
   Okamoto transform [FO] [HHK] applied.  While it is recommended that
   implementations avoid reuse of KEM public keys, implementations that
   do reuse KEM public keys MUST ensure that the number of reuses of a
   KEM public key abides by any bounds in the specification of the KEM
   or subsequent security analyses.  Implementations MUST NOT reuse
   randomness in the generation of KEM ciphertexts.

3.  Construction for hybrid key exchange

3.1.  Negotiation

   Each particular combination of algorithms in a hybrid key exchange
   will be represented as a NamedGroup and sent in the supported_groups
   extension.  No internal structure or grammar is implied or required
   in the value of the identifier; they are simply opaque identifiers.

Internet-Draft           ietf-tls-hybrid-design             January 2022


   Each value representing a hybrid key exchange will correspond to an
   ordered pair of two algorithms.  For example, a future document could
   specify that one codepoint corresponds to secp256r1+PQALG1, and
   another corresponds to x25519+PQALG1.  (We note that this is
   independent from future documents standardizing solely post-quantum
   key exchange methods, which would have to be assigned their own
   identifier.)

   Specific values shall be standardized by IANA in the TLS Supported
   Groups registry.

       enum {

             /* Elliptic Curve Groups (ECDHE) */
             secp256r1(0x0017), secp384r1(0x0018), secp521r1(0x0019),
             x25519(0x001D), x448(0x001E),

             /* Finite Field Groups (DHE) */
             ffdhe2048(0x0100), ffdhe3072(0x0101), ffdhe4096(0x0102),
             ffdhe6144(0x0103), ffdhe8192(0x0104),

             /* Hybrid Key Exchange Methods */
             TBD(0xTBD), ...,

             /* Reserved Code Points */
             ffdhe_private_use(0x01FC..0x01FF),
             ecdhe_private_use(0xFE00..0xFEFF),
             (0xFFFF)
       } NamedGroup;

3.2.  Transmitting public keys and ciphertexts

   We take the relatively simple "concatenation approach": the messages
   from the two algorithms being hybridized will be concatenated
   together and transmitted as a single value, to avoid having to change
   existing data structures.  The values are directly concatenated,
   without any additional encoding or length fields; this assumes that
   the representation and length of elements is fixed once the algorithm
   is fixed.  If concatenation were to be used with values that are not
   fixed-length, a length prefix or other unambiguous encoding must be
   used to ensure that the composition of the two values is injective
   and requires a mechanism different from that specified in this
   document.

   Recall that in TLS 1.3 a KEM public key or KEM ciphertext is
   represented as a KeyShareEntry:





Stebila, et al.           Expires 15 July 2022                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           ietf-tls-hybrid-design             January 2022


       struct {
           NamedGroup group;
           opaque key_exchange<1..2^16-1>;
       } KeyShareEntry;

   These are transmitted in the extension_data fields of
   KeyShareClientHello and KeyShareServerHello extensions:

       struct {
           KeyShareEntry client_shares<0..2^16-1>;
       } KeyShareClientHello;

       struct {
           KeyShareEntry server_share;
       } KeyShareServerHello;

   The client's shares are listed in descending order of client
   preference; the server selects one algorithm and sends its
   corresponding share.

   For a hybrid key exchange, the key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry
   is the concatenation of the key_exchange field for each of the
   constituent algorithms.  The order of shares in the concatenation is
   the same as the order of algorithms indicated in the definition of
   the NamedGroup.

   For the client's share, the key_exchange value contains the
   concatenation of the pk outputs of the corresponding KEMs' KeyGen
   algorithms, if that algorithm corresponds to a KEM; or the (EC)DH
   ephemeral key share, if that algorithm corresponds to an (EC)DH
   group.  For the server's share, the key_exchange value contains
   concatenation of the ct outputs of the corresponding KEMs' Encaps
   algorithms, if that algorithm corresponds to a KEM; or the (EC)DH
   ephemeral key share, if that algorithm corresponds to an (EC)DH
   group.

   [TLS13] requires that ``The key_exchange values for each
   KeyShareEntry MUST be generated independently.'' In the context of
   this document, since the same algorithm may appear in multiple named
   groups, we relax the above requirement to allow the same key_exchange
   value for the same algorithm to be reused in multiple KeyShareEntry
   records sent in within the same ClientHello.  However, key_exchange
   values for different algorithms MUST be generated independently.

3.3.  Shared secret calculation

   Here we also take a simple "concatenation approach": the two shared
   secrets are concatenated together and used as the shared secret in
   the existing TLS 1.3 key schedule.  Again, we do not add any
   additional structure (length fields) in the concatenation procedure:
   among all Round 3 finalists and alternate candidates, once the
   algorithm and variant are specified, the shared secret output length
   is fixed.

   In other words, the shared secret is calculated as

       concatenated_shared_secret = shared_secret_1 || shared_secret_2

   and inserted into the TLS 1.3 key schedule in place of the (EC)DHE
   shared secret:

                                       0
                                       |

   *FIPS-compliance of shared secret concatenation.* [NIST-SP-800-56C]
   or [NIST-SP-800-135] give NIST recommendations for key derivation
   methods in key exchange protocols.  Some hybrid combinations may
   combine the shared secret from a NIST-approved algorithm (e.g., ECDH
   using the nistp256/secp256r1 curve) with a shared secret from a non-
   approved algorithm (e.g., post-quantum).  [NIST-SP-800-56C] lists
   simple concatenation as an approved method for generation of a hybrid
   shared secret in which one of the constituent shared secret is from
   an approved method.

4.  Discussion

   *Larger public keys and/or ciphertexts.* The HybridKeyExchange struct
   in Section 3.2 limits public keys and ciphertexts to 2^16-1 bytes;
   this is bounded by the same (2^16-1)-byte limit on the key_exchange
   field in the KeyShareEntry struct.  Some post-quantum KEMs have
   larger public keys and/or ciphertexts; for example, Classic
   McEliece's smallest parameter set has public key size 261,120 bytes.
   Hence this draft can not accommodate all current NIST Round 3
   candidates.

   *Duplication of key shares.* Concatenation of public keys in the
   HybridKeyExchange struct as described in Section 3.2 can result in
   sending duplicate key shares.  For example, if a client wanted to
   offer support for two combinations, say "secp256r1+sikep503" and
   "x25519+sikep503", it would end up sending two sikep503 public keys,
   since the KeyShareEntry for each combination contains its own copy of
   a sikep503 key.  This duplication may be more problematic for post-
   quantum algorithms which have larger public keys.

   *Failures.* Some post-quantum key exchange algorithms have non-zero
   probability of failure, meaning two honest parties may derive
   different shared secrets.  This would cause a handshake failure.  All
   current NIST Round 3 candidates have either 0 or cryptographically
   small failure rate; if other algorithms are used, implementers should
   be aware of the potential of handshake failure.  Clients can retry if
   a failure is encountered.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Identifiers for specific key exchange algorithm combinations will be
   defined in later documents.

6.  Security Considerations

   The shared secrets computed in the hybrid key exchange should be
   computed in a way that achieves the "hybrid" property: the resulting
   secret is secure as long as at least one of the component key
   exchange algorithms is unbroken.  See [GIACON] and [BINDEL] for an
   investigation of these issues.  Under the assumption that shared
   secrets are fixed length once the combination is fixed, the
   construction from Section 3.3 corresponds to the dual-PRF combiner of
   [BINDEL] which is shown to preserve security under the assumption
   that the hash function is a dual-PRF.

   As noted in Section 2, KEMs used in the manner described in this
   document MUST explicitly be designed to be secure in the event that
   the public key is reused, such as achieving IND-CCA2 security or
   having a transform like the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform applied.  Some
   IND-CPA-secure post-quantum KEMs (i.e., without countermeasures such
   as the FO transform) are completely insecure under public key reuse;
   for example, some lattice-based IND-CPA-secure KEMs are vulnerable to
   attacks that recover the private key after just a few thousand
   samples [FLUHRER].

   *Public keys, ciphertexts, and secrets should be constant length.*
   This document assumes that the length of each public key, ciphertext,
   and shared secret is fixed once the algorithm is fixed.  This is the
   case for all Round 3 finalists and alternate candidates.

   Note that variable-length secrets are, generally speaking, dangerous.
   In particular, when using key material of variable length and
   processing it using hash functions, a timing side channel may arise.
   In broad terms, when the secret is longer, the hash function may need
   to process more blocks internally.  In some unfortunate
   circumstances, this has led to timing attacks, e.g. the Lucky
   Thirteen [LUCKY13] and Raccoon [RACCOON] attacks.

   Furthermore, [AVIRAM] identified a risk of using variable-length
   secrets when the hash function used in the key derivation function is
   no longer collision-resistant.

   Therefore, this specification MUST only be used with algorithms which
   have fixed-length shared secrets (after the variant has been fixed by
   the algorithm identifier in the NamedGroup negotiation in
   Section 3.1).

7.  Acknowledgements

   These ideas have grown from discussions with many colleagues,
   including Christopher Wood, Matt Campagna, Eric Crockett, authors of
   the various hybrid Internet-Drafts and implementations cited in this
   document, and members of the TLS working group.  The immediate
   impetus for this document came from discussions with attendees at the
   Workshop on Post-Quantum Software in Mountain View, California, in
   January 2019.  Daniel J.  Bernstein and Tanja Lange commented on the
   risks of reuse of ephemeral public keys.  Matt Campagna and the team
   at Amazon Web Services provided additional suggestions.  Nimrod
   Aviram proposed restricting to fixed-length secrets.

Appendix A.  Related work

   Quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography in general are
   outside the scope of this document.  For a general introduction to
   quantum computing, see a standard textbook such as [NIELSEN].  For an
   overview of post-quantum cryptography as of 2009, see [BERNSTEIN].
   For the current status of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
   Standardization Project, see [NIST].  For additional perspectives on
   the general transition from classical to post-quantum cryptography,
   see for example [ETSI] and [HOFFMAN], among others.

   There have been several Internet-Drafts describing mechanisms for
   embedding post-quantum and/or hybrid key exchange in TLS:

   *  Internet-Drafts for TLS 1.2: [WHYTE12], [CAMPAGNA]

   *  Internet-Drafts for TLS 1.3: [KIEFER], [SCHANCK], [WHYTE13]

   There have been several prototype implementations for post-quantum
   and/or hybrid key exchange in TLS:

   *  Experimental implementations in TLS 1.2: [BCNS15], [CECPQ1],
      [FRODO], [OQS-102], [S2N]

   *  Experimental implementations in TLS 1.3: [CECPQ2], [OQS-111],
      [PST]

   These experimental implementations have taken an ad hoc approach and
   not attempted to implement one of the drafts listed above.

   Unrelated to post-quantum but still related to the issue of combining
   multiple types of keying material in TLS is the use of pre-shared
   keys, especially the recent TLS working group document on including
   an external pre-shared key [EXTERN-PSK].

   Considering other IETF standards, there is work on post-quantum
   preshared keys in IKEv2 [IKE-PSK] and a framework for hybrid key
   exchange in IKEv2 [IKE-HYBRID].  The XMSS hash-based signature scheme
   has been published as an informational RFC by the IRTF [XMSS].

   In the academic literature, [EVEN] initiated the study of combining
   multiple symmetric encryption schemes; [ZHANG], [DODIS], and [HARNIK]
   examined combining multiple public key encryption schemes, and
   [HARNIK] coined the term "robust combiner" to refer to a compiler
   that constructs a hybrid scheme from individual schemes while
   preserving security properties.  [GIACON] and [BINDEL] examined
   combining multiple key encapsulation mechanisms.
