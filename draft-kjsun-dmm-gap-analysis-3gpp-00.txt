Abstract

   In this document, we provide a gap analysis to apply DMM deplyment
   models to a 3GPP mobile core network. The DMM deployment models are
   described into five models for separation control and data plane,
   and the 3GPP mobile core network is a 4G-based extended architecture
   and 5G core network study architecture. We conduct the gap analysis
   to describe the technology that requires current standards-based
   applicability and extension for technical interoperability between
   two standardization organizations.

1. Introduction

   The Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) solution has been
   investigated to re-locate the current anchor functions in a
   distributed manner and to provide different IP session management
   characteristics for each mobile node session. For deploying DMM,
   five different models are described in [dmm-deployment-models] based
   on the network entities according to the location(access or home)
   and functionality(control or data).

   3GPP has the responsibility to standardize cellular mobile networks,
   and the functional separation of the gateway in 4G Evolved Packet
   Core(EPC) netowrk has also been studied to divide the gateway into
   a control and data plane, defining an interface between them, and

   configuring a data path from the control plane entities to the data
   plane entities by exchanging signaling messages between the control
   plane entities. Futhermore, future mobile core network architecture
   called 5G NextGen has been also studied. For flexible service
   continuity, 5G NextGen have integrated the current distributed
   gateway entities (SGW and PGW) that are deployed in a hierarchical
   manner into a combined gateway to separate the control and data
   plane function. In addition, to provide on-demand session
   management, they separate the attachment procedure of the mobile
   node and the session establishment procedure so that different
   sessions of the mobile node with different service characteristics
   can connect through a network slice. However, mobility management
   solution when the IP anchor function is changing is not decribed
   clearly yet.

   This document provides a gap analysis to adapt the DMM deployment
   model into the 4G/5G mobile network architectures studied in 3GPP.
   Based on studies of the network architecture evolution in 3GPP, we
   analyze whether each scenario of the DMM deployment model can be
   adapted to the 3GPP network architecture under study by showing the
   corresponding mapping table.


2. 3GPP 4G/5G Studies Overview

   The 4G EPC network includes several components that provide IP
   connectivity to mobile subscribers and accommodate the use of
   various network access technologies. In mobility management, many
   different kinds of handover can occur in the EPC network
   architecture. IP mobility is occurred in the Inter-MME handover,
   which occurs between different SGWs, the traffic forwarding path
   between the SGW and PGW should be changed, so the IP mobility scheme
   should be needed. For this, the 3GPP standard can use the GTP or
   PMIP protocol to update the location of the mobile node, establish
   the tunnel between the SGW and PGW, and forward data traffic.

   To improve the flexibility during deployment and operation of the
   mobile core network, 3GPP provides several options to modify the
   gateway deployment. First, the combined gateway entity is defined
   by integrating the SGW and PGW function into a single component in
   [3GPP TR 23.401]. Second, the control plane and the data plane are
   separated for the gateway functions in [3GPP TR 23.714]. The
   operation of the interface between control plane and data plane
   includes managing the state of the data plane in the control plane,
   configuring the session path between the GW-DPs according to the
   service request of the mobile node, and reporting the measurement
   information from the data plane to the control plane.

   The 5G mobile network research is currently under defining key
   issues and solutions, and the detailed protocols have not yet been
   defined. In [3GPP TR 23.799] that is the document for 5G core
   network study, unlike existing 4G networks, there is no
   classification for the SGW/PGW, and only the control plane and user
   plane functions are simply defined. In addition, the connectivity
   between control functions is extended by connecting all functions in
   the control plane through the Interconnection and Routing Function
   (IRF) so that the interoperation in the control plane is more
   flexible.

   Within the context of mobility management, the Mobility Management
   Control Function(MMCF) manages the mobility in the access network
   like the MME in the 4G network, and the Session Management Control
   Function(SMCF) performs as the control plane function of the
   existing SGW/PGW to manage the session connectivity of the mobile
   node in the core network. That is, when the IP mobility of the
   mobile nodes traffic occurs between the different access networks
   or by changing the IP anchor in the core network, the SMCF processes
   the signaling to provide session mobility for the mobile node and
   configures the forwarding policies to the data plane. There is more
   than one data plane functions in the core network, and these are
   included in the path of the mobile nodes traffic to the data
   network, but it may not perform the separate roles as with the
   SGW/PGW in the existing 4G network.

   
3. Gap Analysis for Adapting DMM in 4G/5G Mobile Core Network

   Following five deployment models in [dmm-deployment-model], we
   provide a conformance and gap analysis to apply the IETF DMM
   deployment model to 4G/5G mobile network architectures. Detailed
   description of DMM deployment model is not provided in this
   document.


3.1. Split Home Anchor Model

   In the 4G EPC network, we can deploy the PGW as the home anchor with
   CP/DP separation and the SGW as an Access Node with a legacy entity
   without CP/DP separation. For that, terminology of Home-CPA is
   mapped to PGW-CP, Home-DPA to PGW-DP, Access-CPN to SGW-CP, and
   Access-CPN to SGW-DP. In this case, the current interface between
   SGW and PGW is separated into two interfaces for the control and
   data planes. However, since the SGW is implemented as an existing
   CP/DP combined entity, the destinations of the control and data
   packets must be set differently in the SGW.


KJ Sun, et al.         Expires September 26, 2017             [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    draft-kjsun-dmm-gap-analysis-3gpp-00      March 2017


   In the 5G core network study architecture, the data plane functions
   are not separated into Home and Access. Even though one or more data
   plane functions may be included in the data traffic path of the
   mobile node between the access network and the data network, it is
   not clear whether this separates the roles of Access and Home.


3.2. Separated Control and User Plane

   This model separates the control plane and the data plane from both
   the Access and Home nodes, and it can be applied as a CP/DP
   separation architecture between the SGW and the PGW when applied in
   the 4G EPC network. The parameters for the tunnel configuration,
   such as the TEID according to the bearer information generated
   through the control plane and the QoS-related information, are
   transmitted to the data plane by using the interface between the
   control plane and the data plane, and traffic measurement
   information is transmitted to the control plane for billing and
   policy management.

   Since there is no definition for an access node in the 5G core
   architecture, we cannot find a clear adaptable scenario to apply
   that model. By considering the network slice concept, the 5G
   architecture separates the mobile node attachment and the service
   request process for the authentication and connection state
   management according to the attachment of the mobile node through
   the Common CP function and selects an appropriate network slice when
   the mobile node requests session connectivity to the network. In
   this case, several control planes can exist in the core network, but
   this is not related to mobility management and there is no data
   plane function that is mapped with the Common CP.


3.3. Centralized Control Plane

   In [3GPP TR 23.401], the 3GPP standard allows to
   integrate the SGW and PGW into a single entity called Combined GW.
   In the CP/DP separation architecture, each plane entity can be
   deployed as a combined or separated entity, and the architecture
   with a combined control plane and separate data plane entities can
   be applied. For the combined GW-CP function, the interface between
   control plane functions is no longer required because the SGW-CP and
   PGW-CP functions are combined as a single physical entity.

   With the 5G core architecture, there may be an architecture for a
   single control plane entity to manage multiple data plane entities,
   even without an access node definition. In particular, in a

Internet-Draft    draft-kjsun-dmm-gap-analysis-3gpp-00      March 2017


   multi-homed PDU scenario to manage multiple parallel PDU sessions,
   [3GPP TR 23.799] defines a data plane branching a GW entity between
   the access network and the different data plane functions. The
   branching GW maintains the session between the respective anchor
   data plane nodes and uses the tunnels for traffic forwarding.


3.4. Data Plane Abstraction

   SDN-based EPC networks and forwarding configuration schemes between
   the data plane entities can be possible.  In several studies, all
   EPC control plane functions, including the SGW-CP and the PGW-CP,
   are implemented in the SDN controller as an SDN application, and the
   data traffic path in the data plane network is set utilizing
   southbound protocol such as the OpenFlow. The SDN-based EPC
   architecture has an advantage in that the traffic path between the
   data plane entities can be abstracted from the control plane while
   maintaining each GW role, so a flexible forwarding path
   configuration may be possible.
   
   The 5G core network architecture document also considers SDN-based
   data plane abstraction. Even though there is no definition for
   Anchor and Access node, the data plane GW entities and the switches
   in the core network are abstracted through the SDN controller to
   manage the traffic path from the access network to the data network.


3.5. On-demand Control Plane Orchestration

   This model can be deployed through an EPC network structure with an
   NFV-based virtualization environment and Management & Orchestration
   (MANO) function. In an NFV-based virtualized EPC (vEPC) environment,
   all control plane functions can be installed on a general-purpose
   cloud server using a Virtualized Network Function (VNF), and the
   data plane entities can be physically located in the switch or
   router. Regarding mobility, the Mobility Controller defined in the
   DMM deployment model is an entity that provides mapping information
   of the mobility control plane and data plane functions as needed.
   This is a method to generate mobility services by including VNFs
   according to the mobility in the network.
   
   The 5G architecture research also discusses methods to provide
   on-demand services in a virtualization-based environment. In
   particular, different sets of core network functions by selecting
   network slices according to the type of traffic for a given service,
   even if they are from the same mobile node. A network slice has the

   advantage of providing QoS to meet various service requirements.
   Although the reference architecture for 5G networks has been
   defined, a real deployment model and its details are still under
   consideration.

   the 4G EPC network and 5G core network study architecture.
