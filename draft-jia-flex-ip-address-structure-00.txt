             Flexible IP: An Adaptable IP Address Structure
                 draft-jia-flex-ip-address-structure-00

Abstract

   Along as the popularization and adoption of IP in emerging scenarios,
   challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure.  To
   enable TCP/IP in networks that previously using exclusive protocol, a
   flexible address structure would be far more preferred for their
   particular properties
   [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure].

   This document describes a flexible address structure -- Flexible IP
   (FlexIP) acting on limited domains [RFC8799].  FlexIP is expected to
   proactively adapt scenarios under flexible address structure.
   Meanwhile, FlexIP still benefit from global reachability based on the
   IPv6 interoperability.

1.  Introduction

   As Internet Protocol (IP) gradually turned into the "waist" of the
   "TCP/IP" protocol stack, it is considered to be the core pillar of
   the entire Internet [waist].  Although numerous technologies in this
   "TCP/IP" protocol stack have emerged, evolved, or obsoleted by
   others, the IPv6 technology [RFC8200] is the only forward in network
   layer along with the Internet upgrades.  IPv6, as the unique
   successor of IPv4 [RFC0791] defined by IETF, fixes defects for most
   of its parts.  Most notably, the address space is enormously expanded
   from 32-bit to 128-bit in IPv6 reformation.  Despite that IPv6 is
   expected to serve almost infinite devices in the foreseeable future,
   several scenarios are found in trouble when IPv6 is in use.

   For instance, due to the market and cost requirements, numerous
   Internet-of-things (IoTs) are devised to be tiny and resource
   constrained.  However, such rigorous requirement induce manufactures

   to adopt lightweight protocols like bluetooth, other than TCP/IP, for
   inter communications [iot].  Energy consumption, which is sound in
   most terminal cases, becomes the greatest challenge when introducing
   IPv6 to IoTs.  Document
   [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure] details the
   challenges for more cases of IPv6.

   To conquer these challenges, several improvements are promoted by the
   corporation of related standard organizations.  Document [RFC4944]
   depict the transmission of IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 network, and such
   a method enables indirectly support of IPv6 in IoTs, e.g., Thead
   Protocol [thread].  Besides, document [RFC7668] describe the fusion
   of IPv6 and Bluetooth Low Energy, and such a method also enable the
   communications among nodes with Bluetooth and IPv6.  Although none of
   these proposal is superior on the basis of market sharing, all
   endeavour orientate to the comprehensive adoption of TCP/IP protocol
   stack in new communication cases.

   This document proposes an adaptive IP address format -- Flexible IP
   (abbr.  FlexIP) orienting emerging scenarios
   [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure] within limited
   domains [RFC8799], and maintain global reachability with IPv6.  In
   general, FlexIP is composed through a hierarchical, self-explanatory
   address structure.  Compared to the patch-like solutions (e.g.,
   [RFC4944], [RFC8724]) that passively tune IP to be compatible with
   different scenarios, FlexIP proactively makes address structure
   flexible enough to adapt to various network cases.  This variation,
   opposite to the fixed form of IPv4/IPv6 address, is expected to make
   Internet Protocol agilely cover futuristic and unknown scenarios.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Targeted Scenario

   As a architectural solution for scenarios detailed in
   [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure], FlexIP is expected
   to be adopted in limited domains [RFC8799].  According to the
   definition in [RFC8799], limited domain refers to a single physical
   network attached to or running in parallel with the Internet, or a
   defined set of users and nodes distributed over a much wider area,

   but drawn together by a single virtual network over the Internet.
   Within the limited domains, requirements, behaviors, and semantics
   could be noticeable local and network specific.

   Figure 1 depicts the orientation of FlexIP in IPv6 and Internet.
   Generally, Internet with its backbone is principally composed by
   IPv6, and networks with IPv4 are recognized as legacy and attached at
   the edge of the Internet with transition mechanisms.  The position of
   networks with FlexIP structure is quite similar as IPv4.  For
   networks within limited domains, FlexIP can be marginally adopted at
   the edge of the Internet.  Such network use FlexIP to fulfill
   proprietary capabilities, while retain global reachability through
   IPv6 via transition.

4.  Design Considerations

   As described in document
   [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure], various address
   semantics and variable address length are main characteristics for a
   flexible IP.  However, several principles must be considered from the
   top if such featured address structure become truly practicable.
   Points below details overall considerations and plannings behind
   FlexIP.

4.1.  Multi-Semantics

   For networks with advanced routing, non-topological identifiers could
   be necessary for reachability [RFC7476].  To enrich routing abilities
   in complex network, address structure should be flexible enough to
   accommodate multiple semantics and related identifiers, thus
   forwarding nodes within the network can dealing with these complex
   address according based on the routing system built.

   Ideally, devices that resided in advanced networks construct special
   address format for customized routing, while devices that resided in
   conventional scenario can adopt IPv6 as routine (topology semantic)
   address.

4.2.  Elastic Address Space

   The primary orientation of FlexIP is to adapt different network
   scale, and each network uses different address length that best fit
   the presumptive scale.  The alterable address length refers to a
   flexible address space, and such resilience makes IP highly adaptable
   to theoretically infinite space as well as tailored space
   specifically for low power scenarios.

   Ideally, Autonomous System (AS) that composing the Internet is
   constituted by numerous networks.  Each of the network hold the
   flexible address space that best fit their scenarios.

4.3.  Scalability

   A constrained space is impossible to accommodate communications among
   volume devices, while boundless space is unsustainable due to the
   explosion of global routing table.  To makes the flexibility truly
   values, FlexIP must reach a balance between rigorous requirements of
   expansive address space and efficient routing performance.

   Ideally, the address should be expanded to boundless space, while the
   structure guarantees the performance of fast forwarding.

4.4.  Interoperability

   FlexIP network is designed to be an attached network at edges of the
   Internet, thus interoperability is needed between IPv6 and FlexIP.
   Based on the interoperability, FlexIP, on the one hand, can benefit
   from the advanced network abilities and adapt to new scenarios.  On
   the other hand, global reachability from IPv6 Internet makes the
   network truly values and convenient for realistic use.

   Ideally, a translator module is needed wherever a boundary across
   FlexIP networks and IPv6 networks.  The translator depicted in
   Figure 1 gives a brief architectural instance for interoperability.

5.  FlexIP Address structure

   In general, FlexIP is composed through a hierarchical, self-
   explanatory address structure.  Such hierarchical, self-explanatory
   address structure brings FlexIP elastic address space and multi-
   semantics without sacrificing scalability.  Table 1 details the
   structure of the FlexIP address structure.

                   Table 1: Flexible IP Address Structure

   Shapes in Table 1 describes the formal representation of FlexIP and
   should be used in programing.  Text representation of FlexIP is
   described in Section 6.  Particularly, formal representation of
   FlexIP in this document introduces "/" for readability only.  Such
   "/" MUST be omitted in practical use.

5.1.  Restrained Space Format

   The first address format is called restrained space format and
   specific for small address space.  Such format includes a 1-byte
   space customized for constrained resource devices.  Structure in such
   format guarantees that within FlexIP structure, devices can reach the
   shortest address length under variable length structure and pursuit
   the maximal routing efficiency.

5.2.  Extendable Space Format

   The second address format is called extendable space format.  By
   adopting such format, administrator can choose address length that
   best fit the network.

Internet-Draft                   FlexIP                     October 2020


   Specifically, for networks larger than 239 address space, a 16-bit,
   32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit, and 256-bit can be used by the network with
   Index F0-F4, respectively, and then followed by address itself.
   Particular, a IPv6 (128-bit) address is regarded as a special indexed
   by Index F3.

   For networks prefer a customized space, a 1-byte LenIndex is emerged
   between Index and the address.  Structure in such format ensures that
   address space becomes theoretically elastic and boundless.  For
   example, a 56-bit address is presented by F5/07/3B3A297F50C24F under
   FlexIP structure.  Sequence value 07 refers to the 7-byte (56-bit)
   address length.

5.3.  Hierarchical Segments Format

   The third address format is called hierarchical segments format.  By
   adopting such format, an FlexIP address is composed by multiple
   segments.  Logically, a segment inside the address could be
   considered as an individual routing identifier.  Thus within
   different routing areas, routers on the path should forward packets
   based on the exclusive segment.  The partitioning of the address
   logically splits the large address into several routing segment, and
   segments are regarded small enough that packets flowing in separate
   networks could be forwarded efficiently according to the segments.
   For this reason, structure in such hierarchy format ensures the
   practicability with boundless space.

   Taking an 2-segment address as an example, FlexIP F6/C8/F1/20C12AF2
   present a 8-bit segment C8 and a 32-bit segment 220C12AF2, where
   index F6 indicates the 2 segments behind.

5.4.  Multi-Semantics Format

   The forth address format is called multi-semantics format.  For
   address adopting such format, networks can forward packets based on
   the specific semantics.

   Under such format, a 1 byte SemIndex is used as the indication of
   semantic when Index equal to F9.  Taking the satellite network
   [space-routing] as an example, FlexIP F9/01/F2/A32F84C981002E9B can
   refer to a geographic position embedded address, where 01 refers to
   the geographic semantic, and F2 refers to a 64-bit address length.
   Similarly, such pattern can be used for name based routing [ndn],
   user based routing, or service based routing.

   Given that non-topological semantics and addressing are still under
   open study, specifications for non-topological semantics will be
   depicted in independent documents when technics become mature.

6.  FlexIP Address Text Representation

   Literally, text representation of FlexIP should be human friendly
   compared to the formal representation in Section 5.  Considering text
   representation would be used in extensive written places, FlexIP is
   such representation should be eminently readable.

   This document RECOMMENDED text representation of FlexIP through
   following structure:
   [Length]<SEM>_Value_[Length]<SEM>_Value_...[Length]<SEM>_Value_.
   Generally, FlexIP address is concatenated directly by multiple
   segments.  For each of the segment, the text representation is
   composed by [Length]<SEM>_Value_. Specifically, i.e., for components
   inside an segment, [Length] refers to the length of current segment
   with the Byte unit;
   Then followed by <SEM>, <SEM> refers to the semantic the segment use.
   Within a segment, <SEM> is the only field can be omitted if segment
   points to the default topology semantic -- <TOPO>.  Last, _Value_
   refers to the address itself.  Particularly, _Value_ inherits the
   same text representation as IPv6 that recommended in [RFC5952].

   Table 2 depicts examples for FlexIP representation in text shape.
   Noted that "/" in the formal representation is for readability only
   and MUST be removed in practice.

   For example, [1]C8[8]2001::12F indicates two segments concatenation:
   segment C8 with <TOPO> semantic and 1 byte length, and segment
   200100000000012F with <TOPO> semantic and 8 byte length.  Particular,
   given that non-topological semantics and addressing are still under
   open study, <SEM> identification should be officially maintained in
   IANA.

7.  Interoperability

   To enable global reachability and inter connectivity between FlexIP
   network and IPv6 network, an translator is needed wherever packets
   across the periphery.  Figure 2 depicts the core component of the
   translator, i.e., address mapper, and a sketch for packet traversing
   from a FlexIP network to a IPv6 network.  For any packet leave FlexIP
   network and enter IPv6 network, the IP addresses of the packet should
   be converted by rules configured in the mapper, and vice versa.

                                  network.

   Specifically, there are two kind of mapping policy: stateful
   recording and stateless transforming.  Although both two policy is
   effective for address mapping, stateless transforming is RECOMMENDED
   for system efficiency and operation complexity.  Concrete processes

   of rules generation, distribution and mapping mechanisms are outside
   the scope of this specification and should be documented
   individually.

   For FlexIP network with restrained space format Table 1, for
   instance, a FlexIP C3 should be mapped into IPv6 2001::C3 when
   affiliated packet flow across the periphery.  Conversely, address
   mapper can simply peel of the prefix 2001:: of when packets flow back
   to FlexIP network.

8.  Security Considerations

   As a address format of IP, FlexIP address itself do not involve
   security issues.  While from the viewpoint of the transmission of
   packets, FlexIP has security properties that are similar to IPv6.
   These security issues include:

   *  Eavesdropping, where on-path elements can observe the whole packet
      (including both contents and metadata) of each datagram.

   *  Replay, where the attacker records a sequence of packets off of
      the wire and plays them back to the party that originally received
      them.

   *  Packet insertion, where the attacker forges a packet with some
      chosen set of properties and injects it into the network.

   *  Packet deletion, where the attacker removes a packet from the
      wire.

   *  Packet modification, where the attacker removes a packet from the
      wire, modifies it, and reinjects it into the network.

   *  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker subverts the
      communication stream in order to pose as the sender to receiver
      and the receiver to the sender.

   *  Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where the attacker sends large
      amounts of legitimate traffic to a destination to overwhelm it.ss

   Specifically, there is not any mechanism for FlexIP to protect
   against IP spoofing.  Defending against these type of attacks is
   outside the scope of this specification.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include an IANA request.
