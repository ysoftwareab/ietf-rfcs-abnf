1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
       [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
       58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,
       RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the
       SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
       and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
       protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
       RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
       and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
       [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

INTERNET-DRAFT            High Capacity TC MIB            March 31, 2002

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  The
   textual conventions defined in this MIB module cannot be translated
   to SMIv1 since the Counter64 type does not exist in SMIv1.

2.  Overview

   In cases where a manager must obtain performance history data about
   the behavior of equipment it manages several strategies can be
   followed in the design of a MIB that represents the managed
   equipment, including:

   0    The agent counts events on a continuous basis and,
        whenever desired, the manager obtains the value of the event
        counter and adjusts its understanding of the history of events
        at the agent.

   0    The agent allocates events to 'buckets' where each bucket
        represents an interval of time.

   Telecommunications equipment often makes use of the latter strategy.
   For such equipment the standard practice is that history data is
   maintained by the agent in terms of 15-minute intervals [T1.231].

   MIB modules for collecting performance history based on 15-minute
   intervals have been defined for the DS1/E1 [RFC2495], DS3/E3
   [RFC2496], SONET/SDH [RFC2558], and ADSL [RFC2622] interface types.
   These MIB modules use a common set of textual conventions defined in
   [RFC2493].  Those textual conventions are based on the Gauge32
   data type.

   A need has arisen in connection with recent work on a VDSL MIB
   [VDSL-MIB] to define 64-bit versions of the textual conventions
   in [RFC2493].  Ideally, these high-capacity textual conventions would
   be based on a Gauge64 or Unsigned64 data type, but unfortunately no
   such types exist in SMIv2.  The next best choice would be to base
   them on the CounterBasedGauge64 textual convention presented in
   [RFC2856], but that is not possible either since SMIv2 allows only
   base types to be used textual conventions.  Therefore the textual
   conventions presented in this memo are based directly on the
   Counter64 type, like those in [RFC2856].  They are subject to the
   following limitations:

   -  The MAX-ACCESS of objects defined using these textual conventions
      must be read-only, because the MAX-ACCESS of the underlying
      Counter64 type is read-only.

   -  No sub-range can be specified in object definitions using these
      textual conventions, because sub-ranges are not allowed on
      Counter64 objects.

   -  No DEFVAL clause can be specified in object definitions using
      these textual conventions, because DEFVALs are not allowed on
      Counter64 objects.

   -  Objects defined using these textual conventions cannot be used
      in an INDEX clause, because there is no INDEX clause mapping
      defined for objects of type Counter64.

        DESCRIPTION
            "A counter associated with a performance measurement in a
             current 15 minute measurement interval. The value of this
             counter starts from zero and is increased when associated
             events occur, until the end of the 15 minute interval.
             At that time the value of the counter is stored in the
             first 15 minute history interval, and the CurrentCount is
             restarted at zero. In the case where the agent has no valid
             data available for the current interval the corresponding
             object instance is not available and upon a retrieval
             request a corresponding error message shall be returned to
             indicate that this instance does not exist.

             This count represents a a non-negative integer, which
             may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed 2^64-1
             (18446744073709551615 decimal), nor fall below 0.  The
             The value of a HCPerfCurrentCount object assumes its
             maximum value whenever the underlying count exceeds
             2^64-1.  If the underlying count subsequently decreases
             below 2^64-1 (due, e.g., to a retroactive adjustment as a
             result of entering or exiting unavailable time), then the
             HCPerfCurrentCount object also decreases.

             Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
             because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap'
             semantics associated with the Counter64 base type are not
             preserved.  It is possible that management applications
             which rely solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to
             determine object semantics will mistakenly operate upon
             objects of this type as they would for Counter64 objects.

             This textual convention represents a limited and short-term
             solution, and may be deprecated as a long term solution is
             defined and deployed to replace it."

             IntervalCount(1) and IntervalCount(n) the most and least
             recent intervals respectively, the following applies at
             the end of a 15 minute interval:

                - discard the value of IntervalCount(n)
                - the value of IntervalCount(i) becomes that
                    of IntervalCount(i-1) for n >= i > 1
                - the value of IntervalCount(1) becomes that
                    of CurrentCount
                - the TotalCount, if supported, is adjusted.

             This count represents a a non-negative integer, which
             may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed 2^64-1

6.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the modules
   that define management objects.
