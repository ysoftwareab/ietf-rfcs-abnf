   1.  Introduction
   
   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-types 
   multipart/voice-message and multipart/fax-message for use with the 
   Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) for Unified Messaging..  It 
   also introduces the primary content type concept.  A further 
   description of usage can be found in the VPIM v3 specification 
   [VPIM3].  This document revises earlier sub-type registrations in RFC 
   2423 [V-MSG] for [VPIM2] and RFC 1911 [VPIM1].
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [REQ].
   2. VPIM v3 Scope
   
   The VPIM v3 specification defines a profile of the Internet Mail 
   protocols for use between unified or universal platforms.  These 
   platforms are intended to be full Internet Mail platforms with the 
   ability to handle voice and fax media as well.  Historically, voice, 
   fax and email have existed on separate systems.  Recently, email 
   profiles have been created for both voice [VPIM2] and fax [IFAX] but 
   these are restrictive to only that media and special-purpose computer 
   systems they were intended for.  VPIM v3 lifts these restrictions, but 
   to facilitate efficient unified messaging benefits a primary content 
   type semantic must be provided by multipart/voice-message and 
   multipart/fax-message.
   
   
   3. Primary Message Type
   
   In the early days of Internet Messaging, there was only one media type 
   - text, and a message simply contained one text body. When the user 
   viewed the text, the message was unequivocally "read".
   
   Today, systems can send and receive messages containing many different 
   media (as different content types within a multipart/mixed). For 
   example, a message may contain text with voice, fax and spreadsheet 
   attachments. It may appear that all the media are given equal 
   importance, but in fact, the text is given precedence. A typical email 
   client may display the text in a preview pane. And when the message is 
   "opened", the text will be displayed in the main window and the 
   attachments will be iconified. Once the text has been displayed 
   (within the preview pane, or upon opening the message), the client 
   determines that the message has been "read", even though none of the 
   attachments have been "seen".

   This behaviour is particularly problematic if the sender has requested 
   that a disposition notification (MDN) be issued when the message is 
   viewed. The sender cannot know if any or all of the attachments have 
   been viewed. The mechanism is not helpful if the sender is 
   particularly interested in the disposition of a particular attachment 
   - a fax attachment, for example.
   
   A solution to this problem is to introduce the concept of a primary 
   message type. A multipart message has associated primary content type 
   semantics. The primary content type of a multipart/voice-message is 
   voice, the primary content type of a multipart/fax-message is fax, and 
   so on. 
   
   A client supporting the primary message type concept will not declare 
   a message as "read" until the body part containing the primary media 
   has been "seen".  
   Only when this attachment has been "seen" will a client issue a 
   requested MDN.
   
   It may be apparent that most mail clients currently consider the 
   primary content type of a multipart/mixed message to be text/*. 
   
   New mail clients may interpret the multipart/* content type and 
   display the message appropriately. For example, upon selecting a 
   multipart/fax-message, the client may display the fax attachment in a 
   preview pane.
   
   
   4. Unified Messaging 
   
   Though many systems can send and receive messages containing many 
   different media (as different content types within a multipart/mixed), 
   all the media are given an equal importance.  That is, a message with 
   a voice, fax and spreadsheet attachment may be sent from a system to 
   recipients on many different systems (with different capabilities).  
   If the message was sent to a voice messaging system, and the primary 
   content of the message was the voice Ð the fax and spreadsheet were 
   merely FYI Ð the message would not be delivered because the other 
   contents could not be rendered.
   
   However, if the message was identified as being primarily a voice 
   message, the receiving voice-only system could detect that and deliver 
   the voice but discard the informational attachments.
   
   Support of primary content type will differentiate true "unified 
   messaging systems" from the "media-agnostic" messaging systems widely 
   deployed today. 
   
     Vaudreuil, Parsons & Cohen   Expires 8/26/99               [Page 3]
     Internet Draft               VPIM UM              February 26, 1999
         
   
   A "media-agnostic" messaging system is capable of rendering many body 
   types- text, audio, fax, spreadsheets, etc., but text always takes 
   precedence.
   
   A true "unified messaging system" will recognize the message type 
   (text, voice, fax, etc.) and may indicate this to the user by 
   displaying a differentiating icon. When a message is selected, 
   appropriate action is taken for the type of message. For example, the 
   fax content is immediately displayed, the audio player is launched and 
   the voice is immediately played, and so on.
   
   The unified messaging system will change the status of a message from 
   unread to read once the primary content has been rendered for the 
   user. For example, this means that a voice message is "read" once the 
   voice has been played, even if text annotation or an attached fax has 
   not been seen.
   
   5. Disposition Notification
   
   The message notification mechanism is described in [MDN].  The MDN is 
   generated by the client (when requested in the message) upon 
   disposition of the message. Examples of dispositions include: 
   displayed, deleted, forwarded, or otherwise "processed". The MDN 
   mechanism does not provide semantics enabling the sender of the 
   message to determine with certainty which body parts were actually 
   accessed by the recipient. The MDN mechanism does not allow the user 
   to tag a specific body part for inclusion in the disposition report. 
   As we have seen, most likely the user will be notified when the user 
   has seen the text, even though a fax attachment may be the most 
   important content.
   
   A client supporting primary message type will also provide the missing 
   MDN semantics. Clearly, the client should only generate the 
   disposition report when the primary message content has been seen, 
   etc. For example, an MDN report when the voice content of a 
   multipart/voice-message has been played, or when the fax content of a 
   multipart/fax-message has been displayed or printed.
   
   6. Discard Rules
   
   Existing email servers support messages containing any arbitrary 
   content type. The email clients may or may not be capable of 
   processing message attachments. The sender of the message will be 
   unaware that an attachment could not be rendered unless explicitly 
   informed by the recipient.

     Internet Draft               VPIM UM              February 26, 1999
         
   
   The VPIM v2 specification, on the other hand, requires different 
   semantics. Recognizing that legacy voicemail systems do not support 
   text, the specification does not allow text within a multipart/voice-
   message. However, the specification allows inclusion of an image/tiff 
   attachment. If the recipient system does not support fax, the entire 
   message must be rejected.
   
   These semantics are insufficient because they do not recognize that a 
   message has a primary content. A more appropriate behaviour can now be 
   defined:
   
   If the receiver does not support the primary message type, 
   reject the entire message and generate an appropriate non-
   delivery report (DSN). For example, if a VPIM v3 system 
   receives a message containing audio content encoded with an 
   unsupported codec, the entire message must be rejected.
   
   If the receiver supports the primary message type, the message 
   must be accepted. If the sender requested positive 
   acknowledgment, the receiver must generate a positive delivery 
   report.
   
   If the receiver accepts a message but does not support the 
   media type of some attachments, the attachments may be deleted. 
   However, if attachments are deleted, the recipient should be 
   appropriately notified. For example, consider an Internet Fax 
   device receiving a message with an audio/* body. The server 
   could add notification to the cover page that there was an 
   audio attachment that could not be played.  If the sender has 
   requested positive acknowledgment, the delivery report must 
   contain an appropriate return code indicating some content was 
   not delivered. If positive acknowledgement was not requested, a 
   negative acknowledgement report must be returned containing an 
   appropriate return code indicating that some content was not 
   delivered.
   
   
   7. Primary Media Content Types
   
   , As described earlier, the use of primary content types will allow 
   unified messaging systems to view the message as intended (e.g., as a
   voice message using a plug-in).  This could give the user the voice 
   message (or fax message) interface Ð which would likely be slightly 
   different than the generic view.
   
   Described below are two content types intended as a wrapper to 
   indicate the semantic of primary content type.  When used they MUST be
   the top level content of that message..

   7.1 multipart/voice-message
   
   The MIME sub-type multipart/voice-message is re-defined to hold an 
   audio content and any number of other content type as described in 
   [VPIM3].  Essentially, the sub-type provides a simple wrapper that 
   easily identifies the entire content as being the components of a 
   single voice message.  The sub-type is similar in semantics and syntax 
   to multipart/mixed, as defined in [MIME2].  The difference introduced 
   in this revision is that the primary content of this multipart is 
   voice (audio/*).  As such, it may be safely interpreted as a 
   multipart/mixed by systems that do not understand the sub-type (only 
   the identification as being a voice message would be lost).
   
   If a receiving system downgrades an incoming message (i.e., drops non-
   voice contents for delivery), an appropriate non-delivery message MUST 
   be sent to the originator indicating that contents were deleted to 
   deliver the primary voice content. A notification SHOULD also be sent 
   to the recipient indicating that contents were deleted to deliver the 
   primary voice message.
   
   In addition to the MIME required boundary parameter, a version 
   parameter is also REQUIRED for this sub-type.  This is to distinguish 
   this refinement of the sub-type from the previous definition in 
   [VPIM1] and [V-MSG].  The value of the version parameter is "3.0" if 
   the content conforms to the requirements of [VPIM3]. The default 
   version value (when the parameter is missing) is 1, indicating the 
   content conforms to the requirements of [VPIM1].
   
   Note: [VPIM2] describes the restriction that only specific media types 
   applicable to voice messaging (audio/*, image/*, message/rfc822 and 
   application/directory), are valid Ônext-levelÕ contents of this sub-
   type (when version=2.0).
    
   3.2 multipart/fax-message
   
   The MIME sub-type multipart/fax is defined to hold a fax image as 
   described in [IFAX] and any number of other content types.  
   Essentially, the sub-type provides a simple wrapper that easily 
   identifies the entire content as being the components of a single fax 
   message.  The sub-type is similar in semantics and syntax to 
   multipart/mixed, as defined in [MIME2].  The difference is that the 
   primary content of this multipart is fax (image/tiff).  As such, it 
   may be safely interpreted as a multipart/mixed by systems that do not 
   understand the sub-type (only the identification as being a fax 
   message would be lost).

   If a receiving system downgrades an incoming message (i.e., drops non-
   fax contents for delivery), a appropriate non-delivery message MUST be 
   sent to the originator indicating that contents were deleted to 
   deliver the primary fax content. A notification SHOULD also be sent to 
   the recipient indicating that contents were deleted to deliver the 
   primary fax message.

           The use of boundary is defined in [MIME2]
   
   The version parameter contains the value "3.0" if the enclosed 
   content conforms to [VPIM3]. The version parameter contains 
   the value "2.0" if the enclosed content conforms to [VPIM2]. 
   The absence of this parameter indicates conformance to the 
   previous version defined in RFC 1911 [VPIM1].
   
        Optional parameters: none
   
        Encoding considerations: 7bit, 8bit or Binary
   
        Security considerations: 
   
   This definition identifies the content as being a voice 
   message.  In some environments (though likely not the 
   majority), the loss of the anonymity of the content may be a 
   security issue.
   
        Interoperability considerations: 
   
   Systems developed to conform with [VPIM1] and [VPIM2] may not 
   conform to this registration.  Specifically, there may be 
   unrenderable content types received, in this case the 
   recipient system should NDN the message.  Also the VPIM v1 
   positional identification will likely be lost.
