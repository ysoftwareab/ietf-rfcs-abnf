Abstract


   This set of documents, collectively called the iCalendar Transport-
   independent Interoperability Protocol, or iTIP, defines a transport-
   independent message protocol to allow for searching for busy time and
   the scheduling of events, journals, or journal entries on different
   calendaring and scheduling systems. These documents are based on
   earlier work documented in the iCalendar format. Because iCalendar
   delt mainly with the format of calendaring information and said so
   little about the method for conveying scheduling semantics, these
   documents add scheduling semantics to the base calendaring
   functionality defined in iCalendar.

   The initial document specifies the messages for allowing searching
   for free or busy time information and for scheduling events. The
   second document defines the messages for scheduling to-dos, or action
   items. The third document defines the messages for scheduling journal
   entries. This document set is intended to convey calendaring and
   scheduling semantics between different applications, independent of
   transport. This document is also being offered as a specification for
   demonstrating industry-wide, calendaring and scheduling
   interoperability. The protocol defined by this document is applicable
   for conveying calendaring and scheduling information across any
   reliable transport. This format is useful for both client-to-server
   communication, server-to-server communication, and client-to-client,
   peer communication (e.g., PDA synchronization with a PIM).

   The breadth of this document is limited to exchanging only the to-do
   type of calendar information. It does not address issues related to
   events or journal entries. Instead, the document outlines a model for
   calendar exchange that defines both static and dynamic to-do objects.
   Static to-do objects are used to transmit to-dos from one entity to
   another without the expectation of continuity or referential
   integrity with the original item. Dynamic to-do objects are a
   superset of static to-do objects and will gracefully degrade to their
   static counterparts for clients that only support static to-do
   objects.

1.   Introduction


   The purpose of this document set is to define the format of iCalendar
   objects and how the iCalendar objects are conveyed between Calendar
   User Agents (CUA) and Calendar Services (CS). This involves the
   definition of a protocol that uses the iCalendar Object as the basis
   for a collection of messages that are transmitted from one
   calendaring system to another. The protocol is transport independent
   but can be bound to either a real-time transport or a store-and-
   forward transport such as e-mail.

   This set of documents is based on the calendaring and scheduling
   model specified in [ICSM].

   The first document in the set specifies the messages for allowing
   searching for free or busy time information and for scheduling
   events. This the second document, defines the messages for scheduling
   to-dos, or action items. The third document defines the messages for
   scheduling journal entries. Implemented as a whole, this document set
   will allow different calendaring and scheduling domains to
   interoperate; allowing for the seach for available free or busy time
   information and scheduling events, to-dos, or daily journal entries.

1.1  iTIP Scheduling Transactions


   The profiles described in section 3 (Application Protocol Elements)
   may be considered usage profiles of the [ICAL] and is designed
   specifically for the exchange of calendaring information between
   scheduling applications.

   To-do Publication

       Publish a to-do;

       Change a published to-do;

       Cancel a published to-do.

   Group To-dos

       Request that a to-do be assigned to one or more recipients;

       Reply to an existing to-do request to accept, decline, or
        indicate completion of the to-do request;

       Allow the organizer of a to-do to cancel the to-do;

       Allow the organizer of a to-do to replace the original to-do
        definition, as when a to-do description is clarified or the
        attendee assignment information is updated;

       Allow an attendee to request a resend of the current
        description for an existing request.

   Recurring To-dos and Timezones

       Support scheduling a to-do between individuals in different
        time zones;

       Support for time zones;

       Support for DST rules;

       Create a recurring to-do request with exception dates

2.   Protocol Models


   The protocol model for this part of iTIP is intended to be the same
   as that described in iTIP Part 1. It is repeated here for clarity
   when reading this document alone.

   There are two distinct protocols that comprise iTIP: an Application
   Protocol and a Transport Protocol. The Application Protocol defines
   the content of the iCalendar objects sent between a sender and a
   receiver in order to accomplish the various iTIP scheduling
   transactions (section 1.1). The Transport protocol defines how the
   iCalendar objects are sent between the sender and receiver. This
   document focuses on the Application Protocol. Some considerations for
   Transport Protocol documents are listed in Appendix A of [ITIP-1].

   There are several variations of this diagram in which the Sender and
   Receiver take on various roles of  CUA or CS. These variants are
   detailed in the Model document [ICMS]

   The architecture of iTIP is depicted in the diagram below. An
   application written to this specification may utilize either the
   binding for the store-and-forward transport, the real time transport,
   or both. The iTIP could also be bound to other transports. If a
   capability is not available on a particular transport binding, iTIP
   provides a mechanism for indicating so.

2.1  Application Protocol


   The model for the application protocol is originator-based (organizer
   or owner roles for a request). That is, the originator of a request
   sends it out to one or more invitees. The invitees reply back to the



Dawson/Hopson/Mansour/Silverberg   6               Expires January 1998



Internet Draft     iTIP Part Two - Scheduling To-dos      July 18, 1997


   originator. The originator maintains the status of the event. Only
   the originator can modify or cancel the request.

   The data sources for the protocol are the Calendar Users as defined
   in [ICMS]. Examples of these users are the originator (i.e.,
   organizer or owner) and attendees of an iCalendar to-do. The data
   objects are the iCalendar objects that are exchanged between Calendar
   Users.

2.1.1     Scheduling Transaction State


   The state of the to-do scheduling transaction is described by the
   STATUS and ATTENDEE properties in the to-do calendar component.

   If there are no attendees in the calendar component, then this
   implies the publish - state STATUS.

   The state of a to-do request changes from the time it is initially
   assigned, to when the attendees reply to the request, to when each of
   the attendees complete the to-do. When an originator sends out the
   to-do request, it's state with respect to the attendees is NEEDS
   ACTION. If the attendee accepts the assignment, then the status is
   changed to ACCEPTED. If the attendee rejects the assignment, then the
   status is changed to DECLINED. When the attendee completes the to-do,
   then the status is changed to COMPLETED. These changes in the
   attendee status for the to-do are effected by the attendee sending
   the originator a TODO-REPLY message with their updated status.

   The general status of the to-do is reflected by the STATUS property.
   The to-do STATUS property is controlled by the originator. There is
   no default status. Initially, the originator should either set the
   status to TENTATIVE or CONFIRMED. The originator can also set the
   status to CANCELLED by sending a TODO-CANCEL message to the
   attendees. The status is set to COMPLETED when all the attendees for
   the to-do request have indicated their completion of the assignment
   by sending the originator a TODO-REPLY message with their status set
   to COMPLETED.

   The states of the protocol are contained in the iCalendar object. Due
   to the individual nature of a scheduling transaction, the state may
   be different for each Calendar User. The diagram below describes the
   various state changes.

2.2  Advanced Calendaring Concepts


   The calendaring and scheduling capability defined by this document is
   based on the exchange of messages between the organizer of a to-do
   and one or more Calendar User Agents (CUA). The message protocol
   emulates a "request" and "reply" form of communications. However,
   there is a class of actions that are non-interactive and are more
   consistent with publishing. These include the publishing of static
   to-dos.

   The message format is designed to be used with either a MIME
   electronic messaging transport, real time protocols, and other
   Internet and non-Internet transports.
   This message-based protocol is based on "request" messages sent from
   an originator and conveyed to one or more recipients. A recipient of
   a "request" message may "reply" to the request, in order to update
   their status and may also return transaction/request status
   information. The protocol also supports the ability for the
   originator of a to-do to change or cancel the original request. The
   elements of the protocol also include the notion of user roles.

2.3  Calendar Roles


   Roles are a behavior or set of activities performed by particular
   groups of users or agents at a particular time given the state of the
   application. This specification describes 3 roles that determine a
   range of actions and responsibilities specific to each role. When
   scheduling a to-do with one or more individuals, there are 3 roles:
   OWNER, ORGANIZER and ATTENDEE. The OWNER is generally the originator
   of the to-do request. The OWNER sends the to-do request and receives
   responses from the ATTENDEES. The OWNER is the effective owner of the
   to-do. There are scenarios where the OWNER has an agent or associate
   who acts on the OWNER's behalf, as is the case when your an assistant
   makes assignments for you. In this scenario the ORGANIZER and the
   OWNER are different individuals yet the ORGANIZER is still
   responsible for sending and receiving the requests and managing the
   calendar entities for this to-do.




         Role       Description


         Organi     The organizer is the calendar user that sends
         zer        and manages the to-do --- meaning responses
                     are directed at the organizer. In most cases
                     the organizer is also the owner, but in cases
                     where the owner has the organizer act on it's
                     behalf, the organizer becomes a proxy for the
                     owner. The organizer in this case would place
                     the to-do on the calendar of the owner.


         Owner      The owner generally controls direct
                     manipulation of the to-do. The owner can make
                     unilateral changes to the to-do while the
                     attendees can reply back to the owner. The
                     owner is usually the organizer, but in some
                     cases an agent or associate will act on
                     behalf of the owner and organize the to-do
                     and assignment logistics.


         Attend     Attendees are those recipients who are
         ees        assigned the group to-do. When an attendee
                     responds to the request, the attendee's
                     status property is set to either accept,
                     decline, tentative, or completed




3.   Application Protocol Elements


   Messages are the on-the-wire MIME entities that contain calendaring
   information. The particular type of [ICAL] message is referred to as
   the profile type. Each profile type is identified by a profile
   property specified as part of the Text/Calendar content type. The



Dawson/Hopson/Mansour/Silverberg   9               Expires January 1998



Internet Draft     iTIP Part Two - Scheduling To-dos      July 18, 1997


   following describes the various [ICAL] profile types supported in
   this specification.



     Profile Type      Description


        TODO-PUBLISH      Post notification of a to-do. Used
                          primarily as a method of advertising the
                          existence of a to-do. The ATTENDEES
                          property is not included and no
                          interaction is expected.


        TODO-REQUEST      Make a to-do assignment. This is an
                          explicit assignment of a to-do to one or
                          more attendees. To-do requests are also
                          used to update or change an existing to-
                          do description. Clients that cannot
                          handle TODO-REQUEST messages can degrade
                          the to-do to view it as a TODO-PUBLISH.


        TODO-REPLY        Reply to a to-do request. This includes
                          "ACCEPT", "TENTATIVE", "DECLINE" and
                          "COMPLETED".


        TODO-CANCEL       Cancel an existing to-do request. Uses
                          the UID to identify the to-do to be
                          canceled.


        TODO-RESEND       Resend an existing to-do request. Uses
                          the UID to identify the to-do to be
                          resend.




   Each profile type has an associated collection of properties and
   methods. Some properties are required and others are optional. This
   specification is also designed with the notion that some calendaring
   clients will be capable of reading and posting to-dos (where posting
   means to local calendar). Therefore, profiles such as TODO-REQUEST
   will contain an exact superset of the TODO-PUBLISH property set such
   that a client that supported TODO-PUBLISH could still read a TODO-
   REQUEST.

3.1  ITIP Message Conformance


   An implementation conforming to iTIP must enforce the conventions
   described in the sections below. These conventions have been made to
   improve interoperability. As a side benefit, they tend to simplify
   implementation.

Internet Draft     iTIP Part Two - Scheduling To-dos      July 18, 1997


3.1.1     Restrictions on DTSTART and DUE


   The DTSTART property must always be specified. This specifies the
   date/time that the to-do is to first be displayed. The DUE property
   may be specified. This specifies the date/time that the to-do is
   assigned to be completed. If the DUE property is missing, then the
   implicit due date/time for the to-do is to be set to the current
   date, until the to-do is completed. A to-do request containing DUE
   without a DTSTART is not allowed. The DTSTART and the DUE properties
   may have the same value. If the due date/time is known, the DUE
   property should be specified. The DURATION property cannot be
   specified in conjunction with DTSTART.

3.2  Summary of Application Protocol Elements


   This section outlines the complete property set for each profile
   type, indicating the required (designated by the word REQUIRED),
   optional (designed by the words NOT REQUIRED) and excluded
   (designated by the word EXCLUDED) properties.

3.2.1     TODO-PUBLISH


   The TODO-PUBLISH is somewhat unique in this document in that it has
   no response scheduling message associated with it. Instead, it is
   simply a to-do that can be added by a calendar user agent to a
   calendar as a static to-do entry. There is no defined response to the
   originator of a TODO-PUBLISH message. It's expected usage is for
   publication of to-dos such as those that might be published on a
   website or Internet calendar. The TODO-PUBLISH is simply a MIME
   encapsulated file that can be referenced and opened by the
   appropriate handler for a TEXT/CALENDAR MIME content type and EVENT-
   PUBLISH profile type.

3.2.5     Rescheduling or Changing a To-do

   conveying a new to-do request with the same UID and an incremented

   sequence number. The receiving client must correlate the request to
   their existing to-dos and check the sequence number in order to
   realize that the request is actually a replacement for the existing
   to-do. Individual "A" sends a to-do request to "B" and "C". "B"
   accepts the to-do and "C" declines and includes text in the comments
   property proposing a more appropriate due date. "A" sends "B" and "C"
   another to-do request using the same UID and a sequence number one
   greater than the original request. "B" should infer that the to-do
   request message is actually a replacement for the existing to-do.

   Replacing a to-do request is predicated on using the same UID,
   incrementing the sequence number and replacing the changed calendar
   properties.

4.   Examples


4.1  Published To-Dos


   In the calendaring and scheduling context, publication refers to the
   one way transfer of to-do information. Consumers of published to-dos
   simply incorporate the to-do into a calendar. No reply is expected.
   Individual "A" publishes a to-do. Individual "B" reads the to-do and
   incorporates it into their calendar. To-dos can be published in
   several ways including: embedding the to-do as an object in a web
   page, e-mailing the to-do to a distribution list, and posting the to-
   do to a newsgroup.

   The table below illustrates the sequence of to-dos between the
   publisher and the consumers of a published to-do.



         Action                Organizer                Attendee


         Publish a to-do       "A" sends or posts a
                                TODO-PUBLISH message


         "B" reads the to-
         do publication


         Publish an updated    "A" sends or posts a
         to-do                 TODO-PUBLISH message


         "B" reads the
         updated to-do
         publication


         Cancel a published    "A" sends or posts a
         to-do                 toDO-CANCEL message


         "B" reads the
         canceled to-do

         publication


4.1.1     A Minimal Published To-Do


   The iCalendar Object below describes a single to-do is due on October
   1, 1997 at 20:00 UTC. This to-do contains the minimum set of
   properties for an iTIP to-do component.

   DTSTAMP:19970717T200000Z
   END:VTODO
   END:VCALENDAR

4.1.2     Changing A Published To-Do


   The iCalendar Object below describes an update to the to-do described
   in 4.1.1, the due date has been changed, a start time has been added,
   and the sequence number has been adjusted.

   BEGIN:VCALENDAR
   PROFILE:TODO-PUBLISH

   STATUS:NEEDS-ACTION
   END:VTODO
   END:VCALENDAR

   To identify the to-do the client uses the UID. The SEQUENCE property
   indicates that this is the second change to the to-do. To-dos with
   sequence numbers 0 and 1 are superseded by this to-do.

   The SEQUENCE property provides a reliable way to distinguish
   different versions of the same to-do. Each time a to-do is published,
   its sequence number is incremented. If a client receives a to-do with
   a sequence number 5 and finds it has the same to-do with sequence
   number 2, the to-do should be updated. However, if the client

   received a to-do with sequence number 2 and finds it already has
   sequence number 5 of the same to-do, the to-do should not be updated.

4.1.3     Canceling A Published To-Do


   The iCalendar Object below cancels the to-do described in 4.1.1. This
   cancels the to-do with SEQUENCE numbers 0, 1, and 2.

   The CLASS property is specified, though it is not really needed here.
   Since this is a published to-do, a program that displays it need not
   apply any content filtering based on the CLASS attribute. If this to-
   do is copied into a users calendar, the CLASS would be included as

Internet Draft     iTIP Part Two - Scheduling To-dos      July 18, 1997


   part of the copy. The handling of the CLASS tag at that point is
   implementation specific.

   The RELATED-TO field contains the UID of a related calendar to-do or
   event. The handling of this property is application dependent.

   VTIMEZONE components are discussed in detail in iTIP Part 1.

   The sequence number 3 indicates that this to-do supersedes versions
   0, 1, and 2.

4.2  Group To-Do Examples


   Group to-dos are distinguished from published to-dos in that there is
   interaction between the attendees with respect to the to-do.
   Individual "A" creates a group task in which individuals "A", "B",
   "C" and "D" will participate. Individual "B" confirms acceptance of
   the task. Individual "C" declines the task. Individual "D"
   tentatively accepts the task. The following table illustrates the
   sequence of messages that would be exchanged between these
   individuals. The table below illustrates the message flow.




         Action          Organizer           Attendee

   Timezone components should appear in an iCalendar Object containing
   recurring to-dos. This is especially important if a recurring to-do
   has attendees in different timezones. There can be multiple VTIMEZONE
   components in an iCalendar Object. However, they must be used to
   define the same timezone. That is, there cannot be VTIMEZONE
   components describing both PST/PDT and EST/EDT at the component level
   in the same iCalendar Object.

   The first two components of this iCalendar Object are the timezone
   components. The DTStart date coincides with the first instance of the
   RRULE property.

   The recurring to-do is defined in a particular timezone, presumably
   that of the creator. The client for each attendee has the
   responsibility of determining the recurrence time in the attendee's
   timezone.

   The first instance of the to-do starts on Tuesday, July 1, 1997 at
   2:00pm. Since no timezone is specified in the DTSTART property, the
   timezone component of PDT applies to the start and end times.
   Attendee gb@mcom.fr is in France where the local time on this date is

   7 hours later than PDT or 21:00. Attendee kimiko@mcom.jp is in Japan
   where local time is 9 hours ahead of than UTC or Wednesday, July 2 at
   07:00. The to-do repeats weekly on Tuesdays (in PST/PDT). The RRULE
   results in 20 instances. The last instance falls on Tuesday, November
   11, 1997 2:00pm PST. The RDATE adds another instance: WED, 10-SEP-
   1997 21:00 GMT.

   There are two exceptions to this recurring appointment. The first one
   is:

     TUE, 09-SEP-1997 21:00 GMT
     TUE, 09-SEP-1997 14:00 PDT
     WED, 10-SEP-1997 07:00 JDT

     WED, 29-OCT-1997 07:00 JST

4.3.2     Creating  an Exception to a Recurring To-Do


   The following example illustrates a scenario where a to-do organizer
   changes an instance of an existing recurring to-do. In this case the
   organizer is changing the start and end time.

   END:VCALENDAR


4.3.3     Modify Exception


   In this example the organizer has already created an exception and
   now wishes to make additional property modification. The organizer
   must use both the RECURRENCE-ID and UID to reference the exception.

the recurring meeting parent.


4.3.4     Cancel an Exception


   In the following example, the organizer has created an exception as
   in 4.3.2 and now wishes to cancel it. In this case a TODO-CANCEL is
   sent with the specific RECURRENCE-ID and UID of the exception.

5.5  Latency Issues


   With a store-and-forward transport, it is possible for requests to
   arrive out of sequence. That is, an implementation may receive a
   TODO-CANCEL notification prior to receiving the original to-do
   request. This section discusses a few of these scenarios.

5.5.1     Cancelation of an Unknown To-do.


   When a TODO-CANCEL request is received before the original TODO-
   REQUEST the calendar will be unable to correlate the UID of the
   cancellation with an existing to-do. It is suggested that messages
   that cannot be correlated that also contain non-zero sequence numbers
   be held and not discarded. Implementations can age them out if no
   other messages arrive with the same UID and a lower sequence number.

5.6  Sequence Number


   Under some conditions, a CUA may receive requests and replies with
   the same SEQUENCE number. DTSTAMP is added to act as a tiebreaker
   when two items with the same SEQUENCE number are evaluated.
   Furthermore, the SEQUENCE number is only incremented when one or more
   of the following properties changes:



    DTSTART

    DTEND (for Events)

    LOCATION

    DUE

6.   Security Considerations


   ITIP outlines an abstract transport protocol which will be bound to a
   real-time transport, a store-and-forward transport, and perhaps other
   transports. The transport protocol provides facilities for simple
   authentication using a clear text password, as well as any SASL
   mechanism [SASL]. SASL allows for integrity and privacy services to
   be negotiated.

Internet Draft     iTIP Part Two - Scheduling To-dos      July 18, 1997


   Use of clear text password is strongly discouraged where the
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.
