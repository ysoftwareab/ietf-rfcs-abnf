Abstract

This document describes a framework for providing QoS support in
Mobile IPv6. As the Mobile Node changes its point of attachment with
the Internet, the intermediate network domains traversed by its
packets may change. It is required to program appropriate QoS support
for the MN's packets in these network domains, so that the
performance of QoS-sensitive applications running on the MN is
maintained at desired level. To achieve this, we introduce a new IPv6
option called "QoS Object." Depending on the context, the QoS Object
is included as a Destination Option or a Hop-by-Hop Option in IPv6
packets carrying Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgment messages.
When included as a Hop-by-Hop Option, QoS Object triggers certain QoS
procedures at the intermediate network domains. In this document, we
describe these QoS procedures for the cases of best-effort, MPLS,
DiffServ and IntServ domains, which practically cover all the cases
of QoS enabled network domains that would be available in
near future.

INTERNET-DRAFT        QoS Support in Mobile IPv6       November,2000

1. Introduction

   The provisions in Mobile IPv6 [1] discussed so far, do not have
   any mechanism to inform the routers or network domains in the path
   between the Home Agent (HA) and the Mobile Node (MN), and between
   the Correspondent Node (CN) and the MN, about the quality of
   service (QoS) requirement of packet streams belonging to the MN.
   Note that these intermediate routers or network domains traversed
   by the MN's packets may change as the MN changes its point of
   attachment. Thus, for example, the packets belonging to MNÆs video
   teleconference may get the same forwarding treatment as those
   belonging to its FTP session at the intermediate network domains,
   in the absence of such QoS information. Further, it is not
   possible for the routers or network domains in the end to end path
   to exercise admission control and enforce admission policy, in the
   absence of QoS and traffic volume information about MN's packet
   streams. For example, some intermediate bottleneck network domain
   may not wish to admit high bandwidth video-on-demand packet stream
   of the MN. Motivated by this problem and the fact that IP QoS and
   traffic engineering mechanisms, such as Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) [2], Differentiated Services (DiffServ) [3] and
   Integrated Services (IntServ) [4], will be available in near
   future, we describe a framework to bring QoS negotiation
   capabilities to Mobile IPv6.

   This framework is based on the use of new IPv6 option called "QoS
   Object." QoS Object is included, depending on the context, either
   as a Destination Option or as a Hop-by-Hop Option along with the
   packets carrying Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgment
   options. The basic idea is to include QoS Object as a Hop-by-Hop
   option along with the binding message that travels in the same
   direction (HA to MN, CN to MN or MN to CN) as that of MN's
   QoS-sensitive packet stream. As this packet traverses different
   network domains in the end to end path, the QoS Object is examined
   at these network domains to program QoS support for the MN's data
   packets. In general, only the edge routers of these network
   domains examine the QoS Object, while the routers internal to the
   domains either ignore it or they do not see it in cases such as
   label based forwarding of MPLS. Hence, it does not put additional
   processing burden on the internal (core) routers.

   Section 3 describes the composition of QoS Object option. The
   semantics of inclusion of QoS Object option in packets carrying
   binding messages is described in Section 4. Section 5 describes
   the processing that the QoS Object invokes at the edges of MPLS,
   DiffServ and IntServ domains.

2. Terminology

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[1].

3. QoS Object: A New Option for Mobile IPv6

   The composition of QoS Object option is shown in Figure 1. This
   option is included in IPv6 packets carrying Binding update and
   Binding Acknowledgment, either as a Destination Option or a
   Hop-by-Hop Option, as described in Section 4. We require as many
   QoS Objects as the number of unidirectional QoS-sensitive packet
   streams between the MN and the CN, while binding messages are used
   on a per-host basis.

           Figure 1: Composition of QoS Object option

   - The "QoS Requirement" field describes the QoS requirement of the
     MN's packet stream. An example is the QoS specification in terms
     of traffic classes, such as conversational, streaming,
     interactive and background, as in the UMTS QoS classes
     specification [5]. Each of these classes will be assigned a
     unique integer value.

  - The next five fields constitute the "Traffic Volume" information.
     These fields indicate the amount of traffic that the MN's packet
     stream will generate. The parameters that are used to describe
     the Traffic Volume are taken from RSVP SENDER_TSPEC object [6].

   - Finally, "Packet Classification" information fields describe the
     values of packet header fields that can be used to identify the
     packets of the MN's packet stream at the (edges of) intermediate
     network domains. Typically, the parameters such as, source and

Chaskar, Koodli                                             [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT        QoS Support in Mobile IPv6       November,2000

     destination IP addresses, TCP and UDP port numbers, and IPv6
     flow label, are used for packet classification purposes. Note
     that the values of source and destination IP addresses to be
     used for packet classification can be always inferred from the 
     header of the packet carrying QoS Object itself (see Section 4
     also). However, values of parameters such as TCP/UDP port
     numbers and IPv6 flow labels may be required to be explicitly
     carried in the QoS Object to indicate which packet stream of the
     MN the given QoS Object corresponds to. This is because, binding
     messages are sent on a per-host basis while QoS Object is for
     each packet stream. The Flags field is kept for future use. The
     intent is to use it to specify if certain packet classification
     parameters in the above list are to be explicitly ignored.

   Now, we describe semantics of the inclusion of QoS Object option
   in packets carrying binding messages to the HA and the CN.

4. Inclusion of QoS Object Option Along with Binding Messages

   The basic idea here is to include the QoS Object as a Hop-by-Hop
   Option along with the binding message that travels between the MN
   and the HA or between the MN and the CN in the same direction as
   the MN's QoS-sensitive packet stream. The QoS Object can then
   inform the intermediate network domains about the QoS requirement
   of the relevant packet stream. This information will be used by
   these intermediate network domains to program appropriate QoS
   support for the data packets of the packet stream that will arrive
   subsequent to this binding message.

4.1 Transactions between the MN and the HA

   With respect to the HA, the only relevant direction of MN's data
   traffic is from the HA to the MN and there is no traffic in the
   opposite direction. Hence, QoS support needs to be negotiated only
   in a direction from the HA to the MN. This is achieved by
   including the QoS Object option along with the binding messages
   sent to the HA as follows:

   1. MN includes the QoS Object as a Destination Option along with
   the Binding Update that is sent to the HA. This Binding Update is
   sent with Acknowledgment bit set to one, indicating that the HA
   is required to acknowledge this Binding Update.

   2. HA verifies the QoS Object in Destination Option and includes
   it, with possible modification, as a Hop-by-Hop Option along with
   the packet carrying Binding Acknowledgment.

   3. The relevant routers (see Section 5) at the intermediate
   network domains traversed by Binding Acknowledgment examine the
   QoS Object option to determine the QoS requirement of the MN's
   packet streams that will flow from the HA to the MN, subsequent
   to this Binding Acknowledgment. The Traffic Volume fields in the

INTERNET-DRAFT        QoS Support in Mobile IPv6       November,2000

   QoS Object will indicate the amount of traffic that the MN's
   packet streams will bring to the network domain, and the Packet
   Classification information fields in the QoS Object will indicate
   the values of fields in the packet headers that can be used to
   identify the packets of MN's packet streams. This information is
   used by the routers to:

   i.  Take admission control decision, and

   ii. Program forwarding treatment that needs to be offered to the
   packets of MN's packet streams at the network domain under
   consideration.

   This is further described in Section 5.

4.2 Transactions between the MN and the CN

   Whenever, MN changes its point of attachment to the Internet, it
   may also send Binding Update to CN for the sake of route
   optimization of downlink traffic. For the sake of QoS negotiation
   with the intermediate network domains, MN creates QoS Objects and
   includes them with the Binding Update, as described below. With
   respect to the CN, the direction of MN's data traffic can be from
   the CN to the MN (downlink) as well as from the MN to the CN
   (uplink). As stated earlier, one QoS Object corresponds to one
   unidirectional QoS-sensitive packet stream. The transactions with
   the CN are as follows:

   1. The uplink QoS Object is included as a Hop-by-Hop
   Option and the downlink QoS Object is included as a Destination
   Option along with the Binding Update that is sent to the CN. This
   Binding Update is sent with Acknowledgment bit set to one,
   indicating that the CN is required to acknowledge this Binding
   Update.

   2. The relevant routers (see Section 5) at the intermediate
   network domains, traversed by Binding Update examine the uplink
   QoS Object to determine the QoS requirement of the packets that
   will flow from MN to CN, subsequent to this Binding Update. As
   mentioned earlier, the routers make use of the information in the
   uplink QoS Object to perform admission control and program packet
   forwarding treatment.

   3. Upon receiving the Binding Update, the CN verifies the
   downlink QoS Object in the Destination Option and includes it,
   with possible modifications, as a Hop-by-Hop Option along with
   the packet carrying Binding Acknowledgment.

   4. The relevant routers (see Section 5) at the intermediate
   network domains, traversed by Binding Acknowledgment examine the
   downlink QoS Object to determine the QoS requirement of the
   packets that will flow from CN to MN, subsequent to this Binding

Chaskar, Koodli                                             [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT        QoS Support in Mobile IPv6       November,2000

   Acknowledgment. As mentioned earlier, the routers make use of the
   information in the downlink QoS Object to perform admission
   control and program packet forwarding treatment.

   In certain cases, by virtue of admission control, some network
   domain in the end to end path may not wish to accommodate all the
   traffic indicated by the Traffic Volume field in the QoS Object
   with the requested QoS as indicated by the QoS Requirement field.
   The relevant router at that network domain can then modify the
   fields in the QoS Object so that they are in conformance with the
   QoS support that this domain is capable of. 

5. Processing of QoS Object at Intermediate Network Domains

   When QoS Object in included as a Hop-by-Hop Option in IPv6 packet,
   the intermediate routers examine this option. Typically, there are
   multiple and possibly heterogeneous (as regards QoS mechanism
   employed) network domains between the MN and the HA, and between
   the MN and the CN. Here, a network domain is defined as a
   collection of network nodes (routers) that implements a particular
   QoS mechanism independently and under the same control plane.
   There are Edge Routers (ER) at the edge of these domains and
   Internal Routers (IR) within the domains. Each of these domains
   may be best-effort domain or may employ QoS mechanisms such as
   MPLS, DiffServ or IntServ. The case of best-effort domain is
   trivial as the routers (edge and internal) belonging to such
   domain simply ignore the QoS Object. This leaves us with the
   interesting case of QoS-enabled domains.

5.1 Processing at (the edge of) MPLS domain

   In an MPLS domain [2], when a set of data units (IP packets)
   traverses a common path through the network domain, a Label
   Switched Path (LSP) can be established using MPLS signaling
   protocols. This set is then called as belonging to the same
   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). At the ingress Label Switch
   Router (LSR), each packet in this set is assigned a label that
   corresponds to the relevant FEC and it is transmitted downstream.
   At each LSR along the LSP, the label is used to forward the
   packet to the next hop. Label-based forwarding paradigm enhances
   scalability of packet forwarding engines as they are relieved of
   routing table lookup as well as due to reduction in the size of
   forwarding database by virtue of label merging capability of
   MPLS. Further, MPLS is a very useful tool for traffic
   engineering [7].

   When IPv6 packet containing QoS Object as a Hop-by-Hop Option,
   arrives at the ER (also called as ingress LSR) of MPLS domain,
   the ER determines, based on the destination address of the packet
   and the QoS Object in the Hop-by-Hop Option, the FEC to which the
   packets of the corresponding stream belong. FEC in turn
   translates to the LSP that the subsequent packets of this stream

Chaskar, Koodli                                             [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT        QoS Support in Mobile IPv6       November,2000

   should traverse through that domain. Such LSPs for different
   traffic classes are typically pre-established by the service
   provider between different ingress-egress router pairs, during
   traffic engineering phase. The ER then creates "FEC Mapping
   Context" that will map the subsequent packets of the MNÆs packet
   stream under consideration to this FEC or LSP. The Packet
   Classification information fields in the QoS Object are used to
   identify the subsequent packets of this packet stream at the ER.
   Due to this FEC Mapping Context, appropriate label is attached to
   the subsequent packets of the MNÆs packet stream under
   consideration at the ER. These packets then traverse thus
   determined LSP, while transiting through the network domain under
   consideration. Note that such Mapping Context is required for any
   traffic (not only Mobile IPv6 traffic) that is to be forwarded
   using label-based paradigm. Hence, the edge LSRs at MPLS domain
   already have this functionality.

   The ER then forwards the packet containing the QoS Object to the
   destination ER of the same LSP, over the same LSP or over some
   other LSP. Forwarding this packet on LSP as well, achieves the
   desirable result that the IRs in the domain do not have to
   examine the QoS Object option. Precisely, due to label-based
   forwarding paradigm they do not even see the IP header.

5.2 Processing at (the edge of) DiffServ domain

   The DiffServ QoS architecture [3] is based on a model where
   traffic entering a network domain is classified and possibly
   conditioned at the boundaries of the network domain, and assigned
   to different behavior aggregates. Each behavior aggregate is
   identified by a unique DiffServ Code Point (DSCP). DSCP is
   included in the IP header of the packet at the ER of the domain.
   DiffServ proposes differentiation in the queuing and forwarding
   treatment received by packets at the routers in the network
   domain, on the basis of DSCPs included in their headers at the ER
   of the domain. IETF has standardized two groups of behavior
   aggregates, namely expedited forwarding or EF (one instance or
   class) and assured forwarding or AF (four instances or classes
   each containing three drop-precedence levels).

   When IPv6 packet containing QoS Object as a Hop-by-Hop Option,
   arrives at the ER of DiffServ domain, the ER determines, using
   QoS Object in the Hop-by-Hop Option, the forwarding treatment
   that the subsequent packets of this stream should get within the
   corresponding network domain. In particular, the QoS Requirement
   field in the QoS Object indicates the behavior aggregate that the
   packets of MNÆs packet stream should be assigned to. Further, the
   Traffic Volume fields enable the ER to exercise admission
   control, and possibly, initialize the parameters for traffic
   conditioner for the MNÆs packet streams. The ER also programs
   "Classifier Context" that would mark the subsequent data packets
   of the MNÆs packet streams with appropriate DSCPs relevant for

Chaskar, Koodli                                             [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT        QoS Support in Mobile IPv6       November,2000

   that domain. Packet Classification information fields in the QoS
   Object are used to identify the subsequent packets of this stream.
   Finally, note that the packet classification and traffic
   conditioning functionality is required at the ER of DiffServ
   domain for any traffic (not only Mobile IPv6 traffic).

   If DiffServ is used in conjunction with MPLS [8], subsequent
   forwarding of the packet containing QoS Object through that
   domain is as described in Section 5.1, i. e., over LSP. Else, the
   packet containing QoS Object is forwarded through the network
   domain in a hop-by-hop fashion. IRs in the network domain simply
   ignore the QoS Object. Note that, in the latter case, since IRs
   are employing hop-by-hop forwarding of packets, their
   architecture is already tailored to perform hop-by-hop processing
   of packets. Hence, accessing (and later ignoring) QoS Object does
   not put additional burden on these routers.

5.3 Processing at (the edge of) IntServ domain

   IntServ QoS mechanism defines service classes, such as guaranteed
   service and controlled-load service, that if supported by the
   routers in the network domain can provide the data flow with
   certain QoS commitments. The level of QoS provided by these
   classes is programmable on a per-flow basis. The QoS requests can
   be passed to the routers in the network domain using a
   reservation protocol called RSVP. The requests dictate the level
   of resources, such as bandwidth and buffer space, that must be
   reserved along with the transmission scheduling behavior that
   must be installed in the routers to provide the desired QoS
   commitment for the data flow. IntServ QoS mechanism has not
   gained much popularity due to its poor scalability. Nonetheless,
   we cover this case here for the sake of  completeness.

   When IPv6 packet containing QoS Object arrives at the ER of
   IntServ domain, the ER initiates resource reservation process as
   described in [4]. In particular, it first determines, based on
   the destination address of this IPv6 packet, the egress ER for
   this domain. Based on basic IntServ paradigm (RSVP messaging), in
   the present context, there are a number of alternatives to
   perform resource reservation in the network domain. Here we
   describe one illustrative example. 

   The ingress ER sends PATH message to thus determined egress ER.
   It uses Traffic Volume and Packet Classification information
   fields in the QoS Object to construct Sender_TSpec and
   Sender_Template for the PATH message. It includes (a version of)
   QoS Requirement field in the Destination Option of IPv6 packet
   carrying the PATH message. Note that the destination address for
   packet carrying PATH message is the egress ER. This would inform
   the egress ER about the required QoS support so that it can
   compare it with the performance calculated based on the available
   resources and other parameters recorded by the IRs in, say, AdSpec

Chaskar, Koodli                                             [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT        QoS Support in Mobile IPv6       November,2000

   of PATH message. If sufficient resources are available to support
   the required QoS, the egress ER sends RESV towards the ingress ER.
   Upon, the receipt of RESV at the ingress ER, ingress ER forwards
   the IPv6 packet containing QoS Object along the same path. The IRs
   on this path simply ignore the QoS Object Hop-by-Hop Option. By
   virtue of the resource reservation just established, subsequent
   packets of the MN's will get the desired QoS as they are
   forwarded along the path over which resources are just reserved.

6. Concluding Remarks

   We described a solution for end to end QoS negotiation for
   applications running on Mobile IPv6. The solution is based on
   the inclusion of QoS Object in packets carrying binding messages
   between the MN and the HA and between the MN and the CN. We
   described the processing of QoS Object when included as a
   hop-by-hop option for the cases of best-effort, MPLS, DiffServ and
   IntServ domains, and showed that the solution integrates elegantly
   with these QoS mechanisms.

   For the deployment of the proposed QoS solution for Mobile IPv6,
   two important steps are required. The first is standardization of
   the fields of QoS Object option. The other is implementation of a
   routine in the edge routers of network domains that would
   interpret the QoS Object and communicate with the QoS control
   plane in that network domain. Note that the support for 
   hop-by-hop options is already a requirement in IPv6 
   specification [9].

   The QoS solution described in this document works for the general
   case where the intermediate network domains traversed by the MNÆs
   packets change as a result of change in point of attachment of the
   MN with the Internet. However, certain local optimizations to this
   solution are possible. For example, it is possible to store QoS
   Object at the router where the MN attaches to the Internet. When
   the MN changes its point of attachment to another router, the QoS
   Object can be relocated from the old router to the new router as
   a part of context transfer procedure. When the MN sends Binding
   Update from the new point of attachment, instead of including the
   detailed QoS Object, it can include the QoS Object with a
   particular bit pattern in the QoS Requirement field indicating
   that the router has to fill in the details of QoS Object in this
   packet. Such an extension to the basic solution will reduce the
   wireless bandwidth consumption. Further, certain optimizations are
   possible if regionalized mobility management schemes, such as
   regional registration, are employed. These are the topics of
   future study.
