1.  IETF Introduction

   In March of 2014 the U.S.  National Telecommunications & Information
   Administration (NTIA) announced its intent to transition oversight of
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions.  In that
   announcement, NTIA asked the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
   and Numbers (ICANN) to establish a process to deliver a proposal for
   transition.  As part of that process, the IANA Stewardship Transition
   Coordination Group (ICG) was formed.  The charter for the ICG can be
   found in Appendix B.  They solicited proposals regarding the
   respective functions that IANA performs, in order that they may put
   forth a proposal to the NTIA.  The final request for proposal (RFP)
   can be found in Appendix C.

   While there are interactions between all of the IANA functions and
   IETF standards, this document specifically addresses the protocol
   parameters registries function.  Section 1 (this section) contains an
   introduction that is sourced solely within the IETF.  Section 2
   contains the questionnaire that was written by the ICG and a formal
   response by the IETF.  Because much of this memo is taken from a
   questionnaire we have quoted questions with ">>> " and we have
   prefaced answers to questions being asked with "IETF Response:".
   Note that there are small changes to the content of the questions
   asked in order to match the RFC format.

   As if to demonstrate the last point, the following text was included
   in a footnote in the original propsoal.

   In this RFP, "IANA" refers to the functions currently specified in
   the agreement between NTIA and ICANN [http://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/
   iana-functions-purchase-order] as well as any other functions
   traditionally performed by the IANA functions operator.  SAC-067
   [https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf] provides
   one description of the many different meanings of the term "IANA" and
   may be useful reading in addition to the documents constituting the
   agreement itself.

   IETF Response:

   Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined protocol parameters.
   These parameters are used by implementers, who are the IETF's primary
   users of the IETF standards and other documents.  To ensure
   consistent interpretation of these parameter values by independent
   implementations, and to promote universal interoperability, these
   IETF protocol specifications define and require globally available

   registries containing the parameter values and a pointer to
   documentation of the associated semantic intent.  The IETF uses the
   IANA protocol parameters registries to store this information in a
   public location.

   >>>
   >>> A description of the customer(s) of the service or activity.
   >>>


   IETF Response:

   The IANA protocol parameters registries operator maintains the
   protocol parameters registries for the IETF in accordance with all
   relevant IETF policies, in accordance with the Memorandum of
   Understanding[RFC2860] and associated supplemental agreements that
   include service level agreements (SLAs) established between the IETF
   and ICANN[MOUSUP].

   The IETF is a global voluntary standards organization whose goal is
   to make the Internet work better [RFC3595].  IETF standards are
   published in the RFC series.  The IETF is responsible for the key
   standards that are used on the Internet today, including IP, TCP,
   DNS, BGP, and HTTP, to name but a few.

   The IETF operates in an open and transparent manner [RFC6852].  The
   processes that govern the IETF are also published in the RFC series.
   The Internet Standards Process is documented in [RFC2026].  That
   document explains not only how standards are developed, but also how
   disputes about decisions are resolved.  RFC 2026 has been amended a
   number of times, and those amendments are indicated in [RFC-INDEX].
   The standards process can be amended in the same manner that
   standards are approved.  That is, someone proposes a change by
   submitting a temporary document known as an Internet-Draft, the
   community discusses it, and if rough consensus can be found the
   change is approved by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG),
   who also have day-to-day responsibility for declaring IETF consensus
   on technical decisions, including those that affect IANA.  Anyone may
   propose a change during a Last Call, and anyone may participate in
   the community discussion.

   The protocol parameters registries are the product of IETF work.
   Administration of the protocol parameters registries is the service
   that is provided to the IETF.

   >>> A description of any overlaps or interdependencies between your
   >>> IANA requirements and the functions required by other customer
   >>> communities
   >>>


   IETF Response:

   In this context, the IETF considers "overlap" to be where there is in
   some way shared responsibility for a single registry across multiple
   organizations.  In this sense, there is no overlap between
   organizations because responsibility for each registry is carefully
   delineated.  There are, however, points of interaction between other
   organizations, and a few cases where we may further define the scope
   of a registry for technical purposes.  This is the case with both
   names and numbers, as described in the paragraphs below.  In all
   cases, the IETF engages directly with the appropriate organizations
   to ensure that each organization's policies are followed.

   It is important to note that the IETF includes anyone who wishes to
   participate.  Staff and participants from ICANN or the Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) regularly participate in IETF activities.

   o  The IETF has specified a number of special use registries with
      regard to domain names.  These registries require coordination
      with the Generic Names Support Organization (GNSO).  We already
      perform this coordination.[RFC6761]

   o  The IETF specifies the DNS protocol.  From time to time there have
      been and will be updates to that protocol.  As we make changes we
      will broadly consult the operational community about the impact of
      those changes, as we have done in the past.

   o  The IETF specifies minimum requirements for root servers.  Should
      those requirements change, we will inform ICANN.

   o  The routing architecture has evolved over time, and is expected to
      continue to do so.  Such evolution may have an impact on
      appropriate IP address allocation strategies.  As and when that
      happens, we will consult with the RIR community, as we have done
      in the past.

   o  The IETF is responsible for policy relating to the entire IP
      address space and AS number space.  Through IANA, the IETF
      delegates unicast IP address and AS number ranges to the RIR
      system [RFC7020],[RFC7249].  Special address allocation, such a
      multicast and anycast addresses, often require coordination.
      Another example of IP addresses that are not administered by the
      RIR system is Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) [RFC4193], where local
      networks employ a prefix that is not intended to be routed on the
      public Internet.  New special address allocations are added, from
      time to time, related to the evolution of the standards.  In all
      cases, these special assignments are listed in the IANA
      registries.

   o  The IETF maintains sub-registries for special IPv4 and IPv6
      assignments.  These are specified in [RFC3307], [RFC5771], and
      [RFC6890].  The IETF coordinates such assignments with the RIRs.

   o  IETF standards changes may have impact on operations of RIRs and
      service providers.  A recent example is the extensions to BGP to
      carry the Autonomous System numbers as four-octet entities
      [RFC6793].  It is important to note that this change occurred out
      of operational necessity, and it demonstrated strong alignment
      between the RIRs and the IETF.

   >>>
   >>> A description of how policy is developed and established and

   >>>


   IETF Response:

   Policy for overall management of the registries is stated in
   [RFC6220] and [RFC5226].  The first of these documents explains the
   model for how the registries are to be operated, how policy is set,
   and how oversight takes place.  RFC 5226 specifies the policies that
   specification writers may employ when they define new protocol
   registries in the "IANA Considerations" section of each
   specification.  All policies at the IETF begin with a proposal in the
   form of an Internet-Draft.  Anyone may submit such a proposal.  If
   there is sufficient interest, the Internet Engineering Steering Group
   may choose to create a working group or an Area Director may choose
   to sponsor the draft.  In either case, anyone may comment on the
   proposal as it progresses.  A proposal cannot be passed by the IESG
   unless it enjoys sufficient community support as to indicate rough
   consensus [RFC7282].  In each case, a "Last Call" is made so that
   there is notice of any proposed change to a policy or process.
   Anyone may comment during a Last Call.

   >>>
   >>> A description of how disputes about policy are resolved.

   IETF Response:

   Most disputes are handled at the lowest level through the working
   group and rough consensus processes.  Should anyone disagree with any
   action, Section 6.5 of [RFC2026] specifies a multi-level conflict
   resolution and appeals process that includes the responsible Area
   Director, the IESG, and the IAB.  Should appeals be upheld, an
   appropriate remedy is applied.  In the case where someone claims that
   the procedures themselves are insufficient or inadequate in some way
   to address a circumstance, one may appeal an IAB decision to the
   Internet Society Board of Trustees.

   IETF Response: As mentioned above, [RFC2026] Section 6.5 specifies a
   conflict resolution and appeals process.  [RFC2418] specifies working
   group procedures.  Note that both of these documents have been

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is an oversight body of the

   appointment of IESG members, managing appeals as discussed above,
   management of certain domains, including .ARPA [RFC3172], and general
   architectural guidance to the broader community.  The IAB must
   approve the appointment of an organization to act as IANA on behalf

   of the IETF.  The IAB is also responsible for establishing liaison
   relationships with other orgnaizations on behalf of the IETF.  The
   IAB's charter is to be found in [RFC2850].

   The IAB members are selected and may be recalled through a Nominating
   Committee (NOMCOM) process, which is described in [RFC3777].  This
   process provides for selection of active members of the community who
   themselves agree upon a slate of candidates.  Those candidates are
   sent to the Internet Society Board of Trustees for confirmation.  In
   general, members serve for two years.  The IAB selects its own chair.

   The IAB provides oversight of the protocol parameters registries of
   the IETF, and is responsible for selecting appropriate operator(s)
   and related per-registry arrangements.  Especially when relationships
   among protocols call for it, many registries are operated by, or in
   conjunction with, other bodies.  Unless the IAB or IETF has concluded
   that special treatment is needed, the operator for registries is
   currently ICANN.

   IETF Response:

   A memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ICANN and the IETF
   community has been in place since 2000.  It can be found in
   [RFC2860].  The MoU defines the work to be carried out by the IANA
   staff for the IETF and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), a
   peer organization to the IETF that focuses on research.  Each year a
   service level agreement is negotiated that supplements the MoU.

   Day-to-day administration and contract management is the
   responsibility of the IETF Administrative Director (IAD).  The IETF
   Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) oversees the IAD.  IAOC
   members are appointed by the Internet Society Board of Trustees, the
   IAB, the IESG, and the NOMCOM [RFC4071].  The IAOC works with the
   IANA functions operator to establish annual IANA performance metrics
   and operational procedures, and the resulting document is adopted as
   an supplement to the MoU each year [MOUSUP].  In accordance with
   these supplements, an annual review is performed to ensure that
   protocol parameter requests are being processed according to the
   established policies.

   To date there have been no unresolvable disputes or issues.  In the
   unlikely event that a more difficult situation should arise, the IAOC
   and the IAB would engage ICANN management to address the matter.  The
   MoU also provides an option for either party to terminate the
   arrangement with six months notice.  Obviously such action would only
   be undertaken after serious consideration.

   IETF Response:

   No major changes are required, however, the IETF community has
   expressed a desire for several points to be addressed by supplemental
   agreements to the IETF-ICANN MoU, prior to a transition to post-NTIA
   regime.  Over the years since the creation of ICANN, the IETF, ICANN,
   and IAB have together created a system of agreements, policies, and
   oversight mechanisms that covers what is needed.

   First and foremost, IANA protocol parameters registry updates will
   continue to function day-to-day, as they have been doing for the last
   decade or more.  The IETF community is quite satisfied with the
   current arrangement with ICANN.  RFC 2860 remains in force and has
   served the IETF community very well.  RFC 6220 has laid out an
   appropriate service description and requirements.

   To address issues raised by the IETF community relating to
   intellectual property rights, the IAOC is asked to engage the
   appropriate parties, both inside and outside the IETF, to make clear
   that data in the protocol parameters registries is in the public
   domain.

   To address a desire by the IETF community to have mechanisms that
   allow for additional dispute resolution between the IETF and the
   current IANA protocol registries operator, the IAOC is asked to
   conclude a supplemental agreement regarding jurisdiction and any
   necessary dispute resolution mechanisms that are mutually acceptable
   to the parties.

   To address concerns regarding appropriate contingencies to transition
   to another operator, the IAOC is asked to conclude a supplemental
   agreement that-

   1.  maintains the IANA functions operator's obligations established
       under C.7.3 and I.61 of the current IANA functions contract
       between ICANN and the NTIA [NTIA-Contract]; and

   2.  requires the transfer of any associated marks and identifiers to
       subsequent operators.

   Discussions during IETF 89 in London led to the following guiding
   principles for IAB efforts that impact IANA protocol parameter
   registries.  These principles must be taken together; their order is
   not significant.

   1.  The IETF protocol parameters registries function has been and
   continues to be capably provided by the Internet technical community.

   The strength and stability of the function and its foundation within
   the Internet technical community are both important given how
   critical protocol parameters are to the proper functioning of IETF
   protocols.

   We think the structures that sustain the protocol parameters
   registries function needs to be strong enough that they can be
   offered independently by the Internet technical community, without
   the need for backing from external parties.  And we believe we
   largely are there already, although the system can be strengthened
   further, and continuous improvements are being made.

   2.  The protocol parameters registries function requires openness,
   transparency, and accountability.

   Existing documentation of how the function is administered and
   overseen is good [RFC2860], [RFC6220].  Further articulation and
   clarity may be beneficial.  It is important that the whole Internet
   community can understand how the function works, and that the
   processes for registering parameters and holding those who oversee
   the protocol parameters function accountable for following those
   processes are understood by all interested parties.  We are committed
   to making improvements here if necessary.

   3.  Any contemplated changes to the protocol parameters registries
   function should respect existing Internet community agreements.

   The protocol parameters registries function is working well.  The
   existing Memorandum of Understanding in RFC 2860 defines "the
   technical work to be carried out by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the
   Internet Research Task Force."  Any modifications to the protocol
   parameters registries function should be made using the IETF process
   to update RFC 6220 and other relevant RFCs.  Put quite simply:
   evolution, not revolution.

   4.  The Internet architecture requires and receives capable service
   by Internet registries.

   The stability of the Internet depends on capable provision of not
   just IETF protocol parameters, but IP numbers, domain names, and
   other registries.  Furthermore, DNS and IPv4/IPv6 are IETF-defined
   protocols.  Thus we expect the role of the IETF in standards
   development, architectural guidance, and allocation of certain name/
   number parameters to continue.  IP multicast addresses and special-
   use DNS names are two examples where close coordination is needed.
   The IETF will continue to coordinate with ICANN, the RIRs, and other
   parties that are mutually invested in the continued smooth operation
   of the Internet registries.  We fully understand the need to work
   together.

   5.  The IETF will continue management of the protocol parameter
   registry function as an integral component of the IETF standards
   process and the use of resulting protocols.

   RFC 6220 specifies the role and function of the protocol parameters
   registry, which is critical to IETF standards processes and IETF
   protocols.  The IAB, on behalf of the IETF, has the responsibility to
   define and manage the relationship with the protocol registry
   operator role.  This responsibility includes the selection and
   management of the protocol parameter registry operator, as well as
   management of the parameter registration process and the guidelines
   for parameter allocation.

   6.  The protocol parameters registries are provided as a public
   service.

   Directions for the creation of protocol parameters registries and the
   policies for subsequent additions and updates are specified in RFCs.
   The protocol parameters registries are available to everyone, and
   they are published in a form that allows their contents to be
   included in other works without further permission.  These works
   include, but are not limited to, implementations of Internet
   protocols and their associated documentation.

   These principles will guide the IAB, IAOC, and the rest of the IETF
   community as they work with ICANN to establish future IANA
   performance metrics and operational procedures.

   IETF Response:

   No structural changes are required.  The principles listed above will
   guide IAB, IAOC, and the rest of the IETF community as they work with
   ICANN to establish future IANA performance metrics and operational
   procedures, as they have in the past.

   As no services are expected to change, no continuity issues are
   anticipated, and there are no new technical or operational methods
   proposed by the IETF to test.  The IETF leadership, ICANN, and the
   RIRs maintain an ongoing informal dialog to spot any unforeseen
   issues that might arise as a result of other changes.

   What is necessary as part of transition is the completion of
   supplemental agreement(s) discussed in the previous section of this
   RFP.

   As the current IANA functions operator, ICANN performs its task very
   well, usually exceeding the service level agreement metrics.[METRICS]

   This proposal maintains the existing open framework that allows
   anyone to participate in the development of IETF standards, including
   the IANA protocol parameters registries policies.  Further, an
   implementer anywhere in the world has full access to the protocol
   specification published in the RFC series and the protocol parameters
   registries published at iana.org.  Those who require assignments in
   the IANA protocol registries will continue to be able to do so, as
   specified by the existing policies for those registries.

Appendix B.  The Charter of the IANA Stewardship Coordination Group (ICG

   Charter for the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group V.10

   (August 27, 2014)

   The IANA stewardship transition coordination group (ICG) has one
   deliverable: a proposal to the U.S.  Commerce Department National
   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) regarding
   the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions to the
   global multi-stakeholder community.  The group will conduct itself
   transparently, consult with a broad range of stakeholders, and ensure
   that its proposals support the security and stability of the IANA
   functions.

   The group's mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal
   among the communities affected by the IANA functions.  The IANA
   functions are divided into three main categories: domain names,
   number resources, and other protocol parameters.  The domain names
   category falls further into the country code and generic domain name
   sub-categories.  While there is some overlap among all of these
   categories, each poses distinct organizational, operational and
   technical issues, and each tends to have distinct communities of
   interest and expertise.  For those reasons it is best to have work on
   the three categories of IANA parameters proceed autonomously in
   parallel and be based in the respective communities.

   The IANA stewardship transition process is taking place alongside a
   parallel and related process on enhancing ICANN accountability.
   While maintaining the accountability of Internet identifier
   governance is central to both processes, this group's scope is
   focused on the arrangements required for the continuance of IANA
   functions in an accountable and widely accepted manner after the

Internet-Draft             IANA ICG Response                October 2014


   expiry of the NTIA-ICANN contract.  Nevertheless, the two processes
   are interrelated and interdependent and should appropriately
   coordinate their work.

   The coordination group has four main tasks:
   (i) Act as liaison to all interested parties, including the three
       "operational communities" (i.e., those with direct operational
       or service relationship with IANA; namely names, numbers,
       protocol parameters). This task consists of:
        a. Soliciting proposals from the operational communities
        b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities
           affected by the IANA functions
   (ii) Assess the outputs of the three operational communities for
        compatibility and interoperability
   (iii) Assemble a complete proposal for the transition
   (iv) Information sharing and public communication
   Describing each in more detail:
      (i) Liaison
        a. Solicit proposals


   The ICG expects a plan from the country code and generic name
   communities (possibly a joint one), a plan from the numbers
   community, and a plan from the protocol parameters community.
   Members of the ICG will ensure that the communities from which they
   are drawn are working on their part of the transition plans.  This
   involves informing them of requirements and schedules, tracking
   progress, and highlighting the results or remaining issues.  The role
   of a coordination group member during this phase is to provide status
   updates about the progress of his or her community in developing
   their component, and to coordinate which community will develop a
   transition proposal for each area of overlap (e.g., special-use
   registry).

   While working on the development of their proposals, the operational
   communities are expected to address common requirements and issues
   relating to the transition, in as far as they affect their parts of
   the stewardship of IANA functions.

   b.  Solicit broader input

   The ICG is open for input and feedback from all interested parties.
   While no set of formal requirements related to a transition proposal
   will be requested outside the operational communities, everyone's
   input is welcome across all topics.

   The ICG expects that all interested parties get involved as early as
   possible in the relevant community processes.  Input received



Lear & Housley           Expires April 30, 2015                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft             IANA ICG Response                October 2014


   directly by the ICG may be referred to the relevant community
   discussion.

   The ICG members chosen from a particular community are the official
   communication channel between the ICG and that community.

   (ii) Assessment

   When the group receives output from the communities it will discuss
   and assess their compatibility and interoperability with the
   proposals of the other communities.  Each proposal should be
   submitted with a clear record of how consensus has been reached for
   the proposal in the community, and provide an analysis that shows the
   proposal is in practice workable.  The ICG should also compile the
   input it has received beyond the operational communities, and review
   the impacts of this input.

   The ICG might at some point detect problems with the component
   proposals.  At that point the role of the ICG is to communicate that
   back to the relevant communities so that they (the relevant
   communities) can address the issues.  It is not in the role of the
   ICG to develop proposals or to select from among competing proposals.

   (iii) Assembling and submitting a complete proposal

   The assembly effort involves taking the proposals for the different
   components and verifying that the whole fulfills the intended scope,
   meets the intended criteria, that there are no missing parts, and
   that the whole fits together.  The whole also needs to include
   sufficient independent accountability mechanisms for running the IANA
   function.  The ICG will then develop a draft final proposal that
   achieves rough consensus within the ICG itself.  The ICG will then
   put this proposal up for public comment involving a reasonable period
   of time for reviewing the draft proposal, analyzing and preparing
   supportive or critical comments.  The ICG will then review these
   comments and determine whether modifications are required.  If no
   modifications are needed, and the coordination group agrees, the
   proposal will be submitted to NTIA.

   If changes are required to fix problems or to achieve broader
   support, the ICG will work with the operational communities in a
   manner similar to what was described in task (ii) above.  Updates are
   subject to the same verification, review, and consensus processes as
   the initial proposals.  If, in the ICG's opinion, broad public
   support for the proposal as articulated by the NTIA is not present,
   the parts of the proposal that are not supported return to the
   liaison phase.

   (iv) Information sharing

   The ICG serves as a central clearinghouse for public information
   about the IANA stewardship transition process.  Its secretariat
   maintains an independent, publicly accessible and open website, under
   its own domain, where status updates, meetings and notices are
   announced, proposals are stored, the ICG members are listed, etc.  As
   the development of the transition plans will take some time, it is
   important that information about ongoing work is distributed early
   and continuously.  This will enable sharing of ideas and the
   detection of potential issues.

Appendix C.  IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group Request for
             Proposals

   IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group Request for Proposals

   8 September 2014

   Introduction

   Under the IANA1 Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG)
   Charter,2 the ICG has four main tasks:

   (i) Act as liaison to all interested parties in the IANA
       stewardship transition, including the three "operational
       communities" (i.e., those with direct operational or service
       relationships with the IANA functions operator; namely names,
       numbers, protocol parameters). This task consists of: &#8232;

      a. Soliciting proposals from the operational communities
      b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities
         affected by the&#8232;IANA functions

   (ii) Assess the outputs of the three operational communities for
        compatibility and interoperability (iii) Assemble a complete
        proposal for the transition

   (iv) Information sharing and public communication

   This Request for Proposals (RFP) addresses task (i) of the ICG
   Charter. This RFP does not preclude any form of input from the
   non-operational communities.

   0. Complete Formal Responses

   The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) seeks
   complete formal responses to this RFP through processes which are to

   be convened by each of the "operational communities" of IANA (i.e.,
   those with direct operational or service relationships with the IANA
   functions operator, in connection with names, numbers, or protocol
   parameters).

   Proposals should be supported by the broad range of stakeholders
   participating in the proposal development process. Proposals should
   be developed through a transparent process that is open to and
   inclusive of all stakeholders interested in participating in the
   development of the proposal. In order to help the ICG maintain its
   light coordination role, all interested and affected parties are
   strongly encouraged to participate directly in these community
   processes.

   processes and how to participate in them, and that will continue to

   constituting the agreement itself.

   Communities are asked to adhere to open and inclusive processes in
   developing their responses, so that all community members may fully
   participate in and observe those processes. Communities are also
   asked to actively seek out and encourage wider participation by any
   other parties with interest in their response.

   A major challenge of the ICG will be to identify and help to
   reconcile differences between submitted proposals, in order to
   produce a single plan for the transition of IANA
   stewardship. Submitted Proposals should therefore focus on those
   elements that are considered to be truly essential to the transition
   of their specific IANA functions.  The target deadline for all
   complete formal responses to this RFP is 15 January 2015.

   I. Comments

   While the ICG is requesting complete formal proposals through

   processes convened by each of the operational communities, and that
   all interested parties get involved as early as possible in the
   relevant community processes, some parties may choose to provide
   comments directly to the ICG about specific aspects of particular
   proposals, about the community processes, or about the ICG's own
   processes. Comments may be directly submitted to the ICG any time
   via email to icg-forum@icann.org. Comments will be publicly archived
   at <http://forum.icann.org/lists/icg-forum/>.

   Commenters should be aware that ICG will direct comments received to
   the relevant operational communities if appropriate. The ICG will
   review comments received as time and resources permit and in
   accordance with the overall timeline for the transition. That is,
   comments received about specific proposals may not be reviewed until
   those proposals have been submitted to the ICG. The ICG may
   establish defined public comment periods about specific topics in
   the future, after the complete formal responses to the RFP have been
   received.

   Required Proposal Elements

   The ICG encourages each community to submit a single proposal that
   contains the elements described in this section.

   Communities are requested to describe the elements delineated in the
   sections below in as much detail possible, and according to the
   suggested format/structure, to allow the ICG to more easily
   assimilate the results. While each question is narrowly defined to
   allow for comparison between answers, respondents are encouraged to
   provide further information in explanatory sections, including
   descriptive summaries of policies/practices and associated
   references to source documents of specific policies/practices. In
   this way, the responses to the questionnaire will be useful at the
   operational level as well as to the broader stakeholder communities.

   In the interest of completeness and consistency, proposals should
   cross-reference wherever appropriate the current IANA Functions
   Contract[3] when describing existing arrangements and proposing
   changes to existing arrangements.

   This section should list the specific, distinct IANA functions your
   community relies on. For each IANA function on which your community
   relies, please provide the following:

    o A description of the function;
    o A description of the customer(s) of the function;
    o What registries are involved in providing the function;
    o A description of any overlaps or interdependencies between your
      IANA requirements and the functions required by other customer
      communities.

   If your community relies on any other IANA service or activity
   beyond the scope of the IANA functions contract, you may describe
   them here. In this case please also describe how the service or
   activity should be addressed by the transition plan.

   II. Existing, Pre-Transition Arrangements

   This section should describe how existing IANA-related arrangements
   work, prior to the transition.

   A. Policy Sources

   This section should identify the specific source(s) of policy which
   must be followed by the IANA functions operator in its conduct of
   the services or activities described above. If there are distinct
   sources of policy or policy development for different IANA
   functions, then please describe these separately. For each source of
   policy or policy development, please provide the following:

    o Which IANA function (identified in Section I) are affected.
    o A description of how policy is developed and established and who
      is involved in policy development and establishment.
    o A description of how disputes about policy are resolved.
    o References to documentation of policy development and dispute
      resolution processes.

   B. Oversight and Accountability

   This section should describe all the ways in which oversight is
   conducted over the IANA functions operator's provision of the
   services and activities listed in Section I and all the ways in
   which the IANA functions operator is currently held accountable for
   the provision of those services. For each oversight or

   accountability mechanism, please provide as many of the following as
   are applicable:


   Which IANA functions (identified in Section I) are affected.  If the
   policy sources identified in Section II.A are affected, identify
   which ones are affected and explain in what way.

    o A description of the entity or entities that provide oversight or
      perform accountability functions, including how individuals are
      selected or removed from participation in those entities.
    o A description of the mechanism (e.g., contract, reporting scheme,
      auditing scheme, etc.). This should include a description of the
      consequences of the IANA functions operator not meeting the
      standards established by the mechanism, the extent to which the
      output of the mechanism is transparent and the terms under which
      the mechanism may change.
    o Jurisdiction(s) in which the mechanism applies and the legal basis
      on which the mechanism rests.

   III. Proposed Post-Transition Oversight and Accountability
        Arrangements

   This section should describe what changes your community is
   proposing to the arrangements listed in Section II.B in light of the
   transition. If your community is proposing to replace one or more
   existing arrangements with new arrangements, that replacement should
   be explained and all of the elements listed in Section II.B should
   be described for the new arrangements. Your community should provide
   its rationale and justification for the new arrangements.

   If your community's proposal carries any implications for the
   interface between the IANA functions and existing policy arrangements
   described in Section II.A, those implications should be described
   here.

   If your community is not proposing changes to arrangements listed in
   Section II.B, the rationale and justification for that choice should
   be provided here.

   IV. Transition Implications

   This section should describe what your community views as the
   implications of the changes it proposed in Section III. These
   implications may include some or all of the following, or other
   implications specific to your community:

   Description of operational requirements to achieve continuity of

Internet-Draft             IANA ICG Response                October 2014


   service and possible new service integration throughout the
   transition.

   Risks to operational continuity and how they will be addressed.
   Description of any legal framework requirements in the absence of the
   NTIA contract. Description of how you have tested or evaluated the
   workability of any new technical or operational methods proposed in
   this document and how they compare to established arrangements.
   Description of how long the proposals in Section III are expected to
   take to complete, and any intermediate milestones that may occur
   before they are completed.

   V. NTIA Requirements

   Additionally, NTIA has established that the transition proposal must
   meet the following five requirements:
    o Support and enhance the multistakeholder model;
    o Maintain the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet
      DNS;
    o Meet the needs and expectation of the global customers and
      partners of the IANA functions;
    o Maintain the openness of the Internet;
    o The proposal must not replace the NTIA role with a government-led
      or an inter-governmental organization solution.

   This section should explain how your community's proposal meets these
   requirements and how it responds to the global interest in the IANA
   functions.

   VI. Community Process
   This section should describe the process your community used for
   developing this proposal, including:
    o The steps that were taken to develop the proposal and to determine
      consensus.
    o Links to announcements, agendas, mailing lists, consultations and
      meeting proceedings.
    o An assessment of the level of consensus behind your community's
      proposal, including a description of areas of contention or
      disagreement.
