     2.  Abstract

     This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
     (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
     based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
     managing the Open Shortest Path First Routing Protocol.

     This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for
     the Internet community.

     3.  The Network Management Framework

     The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
     three components.  They are:

     RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
     RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which
     is wholly consistent with the SMI.

     RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213 defines MIB-II,
     an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and
     new operational requirements.

     RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
     access to managed objects.

     The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
     purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

     4.  Objects

     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
     termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
     MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
     One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
     object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
     object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
     specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
     object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
     instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
     use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
     refer to the object type.

     The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
     structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
     language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
     purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
     These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

     The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
     is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
     tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
     how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
     the network.

     The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
     [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
     SNMP.

     4.1.  Format of Definitions

     Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
     types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
     defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
     by the extensions specified in RFC1212 [13].

     4.2.  Changes from RFC 1253

     The changes from RFC 1253 are the following:

     (1)  The textual convention PositiveInteger was changed from
          1..'FFFFFFFF'h to 1..'7FFFFFFF'h at the request of
          Marshall Rose.

     Internet Draft             OSPF MIB              November 1992


     (2)  The textual convention TOSType was changed to reflect the
          TOS values defined in the Router Requirements Draft, and
          in accordance with the IP Forwarding Table MIB's values.

     (3)  The names of some objects were changed, conforming to the
          convention that an acronym (for example, LSA) is a single
          word ("Lsa") in most SNMP names.

     (4)  textual changes were made to make the MIB readable by
          Dave Perkins' SMIC MIB Compiler in addition to Mosy.
          This involved changing the case of some characters in
          certain names and removing the DEFVAL clauses for
          Counters.  (This would appear to violate RFC 1212, which
          explicitly states that DEFVALs are for the purpose of
          initializing read-only objects???)

     (5)  The variables ospfAreaStatus and ospfIfStatus were added,
          having been overlooked in the original MIB.

     (6)  The range of the variable ospfLsdbType was extended to
          include multicastLink (Multicast LSA) and
          nssaExternalLink (NSSA LSA).

     (7)  The variable ospfIfMetricMetric was renamed
          ospfIfMetricValue, and the following text was removed
          from its description:

          "The value FFFF is distinguished to mean 'no route via
          this TOS'."

     (8)  The range of the variable ospfNBMANbrStatus was extended
          from by this means, dynamically learned and configured
          neighbors can be distinguished.

     (9)  The DESCRIPTION of the variable ospfNbrIpAddr was changed
          from

          "The IP address of this neighbor."

          to

          "The IP address this neighbor is using in its IP Source
          Address.  Note that, on addressless links, this will not
          be 0.0.0.0, but the address of another of the neighbor's
          interfaces."

     Internet Draft             OSPF MIB              November 1992


          This is by way of clarification and does not change the
          specification.

     (10) The OSPF External Link State Database was added.  The
          OSPF Link State Database used to display all LSAs stored;
          in this MIB, it displays all but the AS External LSAs.
          This is because there are usually a large number of
          External LSAs, and they are relicated in all non-Stub
          Areas.

     (11) The variable ospfAreaSummary was added to control the
          import of summary LSAs into stub areas.  If it is
          noAreaSummary (default) the router will neither originate
          nor propagate summary LSAs into the stub area.  It will
          rely entirely on its default route.  If it is
          sendAreaSummary, the router will both summarize and
          propagate summary LSAs.

     (12) The general variable ospfExtLsdbLimit was introduced to
          help handle LSDB overflow.

     (13) The use of the IP Forwarding Table is defined.

     (14) The range of the variable ospfAreaRangeStatus was
          extended to include the concepts advertiseMatching,
          invalid (delete), and doNotAdvertiseMatching.  This
          permits the network manager to hide a subnet within an
          area.

     (15) Normally, the border router of a stub area advertises a
          default route as an OSPF network summary.  An NSSA border
          router will generate a type-5 LSA indicating a default
          route, and import it into the NSSA.  ospfStubMetricType
          (ospf internal, type 1 external, or type 2 external)
          indicates the type of the default metric advertised.

     (16) ospfMulticastForwarding is added to the OSPF General
          Group.  This indicates the router's ability to forward IP
          multicast (class D) datagrams.

     (17) ospfIfMulticastForwarding in the Interface Group.  It
          indicates whether, and if so, how, multicasts should be
          forwarded on the interface.

     5.  Overview

     5.1.  Textual Conventions

     Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention
     in this MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the
     readability of the specification and can ease comparison with
     other specifications if appropriate.  It should be noted that
     the introduction of the these textual conventions has no
     effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed
     objects.  The use of these is merely an artifact of the
     explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of one of
     these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
     define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or
     the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual
     conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of
     readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear,
     concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

     The new data types are AreaID, RouterID, TOSType, Metric,
     BigMetric, TruthValue, Status, Validation, PositiveInteger,
     HelloRange, UpToMaxAge, InterfaceIndex, and
     DesignatedRouterPriority.

     5.2.  Structure of MIB

     The MIB is composed of the following sections:
          General Variables
          Area Data Structure
          Area Stub Metric Table
          Link State Database
          Address Range Table
          Host Table
          Interface Table
          Interface Metric Table
          Virtual Interface Table
          Neighbor Table
          Virtual Neighbor Table
          External Link State Database

     5.2.1.  General Variables

     The General Variables are about what they sound like;
     variables which are global to the OSPF Process.

     Internet Draft             OSPF MIB              November 1992


     5.2.2.  Area Data Structure and Area Stub Metric Table

     The Area Data Structure describes the OSPF Areas that the
     router participates in.  The Area Stub Metric Table describes
     the metrics advertised into a stub area by the default
     router(s).

     5.2.3.  Link State Database and External Link State Database

     The Link State Database is provided primarily to provide
     detailed information for network debugging.

     5.2.4.  Address Table and Host Tables

     The Address Range Table and Host Table are provided to view
     configured Network Summary and Host Route information.

     5.2.5.  Interface and Interface Metric Tables

     The Interface Table and the Interface Metric Table together
     describe the various IP interfaces to OSPF.  The metrics are
     placed in separate tables in order to simplify dealing with
     multiple types of service, and to provide flexibility in the
     event that the IP TOS definition is changed in the future.  A
     Default Value specification is supplied for the TOS 0
     (default) metric.

     5.2.6.  Virtual Interface Table

     Likewise, the Virtual Interface Table describe virtual links
     to the OSPF Process.

     5.2.7.  Neighbor and Virtual Neighbor Tables

     The Neighbor Table and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the
     neighbors to the OSPF Process.

     5.3.  Conceptual Row Creation

     For the benefit of row-creation in "conceptual" (see [9])
     tables, DEFVAL (Default Value) clauses are included in the
     definitions in section 5, suggesting values which an agent
     should use for instances of variables which need to be created
     due to a Set-Request, but which are not specified in the Set-
     Request.  DEFVAL clauses have not been specified for some

     Internet Draft             OSPF MIB              November 1992


     objects which are read-only, implying that they are zeroed
     upon row creation.  These objects are of the SYNTAX Counter or
     Gauge.

     For those objects not having a DEFVAL clause, both management
     stations and agents should heed the Robustness Principle of
     the Internet (see RFC-791):

          "be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you
          send"

     That is, management stations should include as many of these
     columnar objects as possible (e.g., all read-write objects) in
     a Set-Request when creating a conceptual row; agents should
     accept a Set-Request with as few of these as they need (e.g.,
     the minimum contents of a row creating SET consists of those
     objects for which, as they cannot be intuited, no default is
     specified.).

     There are numerous read-write objects in this MIB, as it is
     designed for SNMP management of the protocol, not just SNMP
     monitoring of its state.  However, in the absence of a
     standard SNMP Security architecture, it is acceptable for
     implementations to implement these as read-only with an
     alternative interface for their modification.

     5.4.  Default Configuration

     OSPF is a powerful routing protocol, equipped with features to
     handle virtually any configuration requirement that might
     reasonably be found within an Autonomous System.  With this
     power comes a fair degree of complexity, which the sheer
     number of objects in the MIB will attest to.  Care has
     therefore been taken, in constructing this MIB, to define
     default values for virtually every object, to minimize the
     amount of parameterization required in the typical case.  That
     default configuration is as follows:

     Given the following assumptions:

     -    IP has already been configured

     -    The ifTable has already been configured

     -    ifSpeed is estimated by the interface drivers

     -    The OSPF Process automatically discovers all IP
          Interfaces and creates corresponding OSPF Interfaces

     -    The TOS 0 metrics are autonomously derived from ifSpeed

     -    The OSPF Process automatically creates the Areas required
          for the Interfaces

     The simplest configuration of an OSPF process requires that:

     -    The OSPF Process be Enabled.

     This can be accomplished with a single SET:
                       ospfAdminStat := enabled.

     The configured system will have the following attributes:

     -    The RouterID will be one of the IP addresses of the
          device

     -    The device will be neither an Area Border Router nor an
          Autonomous System Border Router.

     -    Every IP Interface, with or without an address, will be
          an OSPF Interface.

     -    The AreaID of each interface will be 0.0.0.0, the
          Backbone.

     -    Authentication will be disabled

     -    All Broadcast and Point to Point interfaces will be
          operational.  NBMA Interfaces require the configuration
          of at least one neighbor.

     -    Timers on all direct interfaces will be:
               Hello Interval:        10 seconds
               Dead Timeout:          40 Seconds
               Retransmission:         5 Seconds
               Transit Delay:          1 Second
               Poll Interval:        120 Seconds

     -    no direct links to hosts will be configured.

     -    no addresses will be summarized

     -    Metrics, being a measure of bit duration, are unambiguous
          and intelligent.

     -    No Virtual Links will be configured.

     --  OSPF Interface Metric Table

     --      The Metric Table describes the metrics to be advertised
     --      for a specified interface at the various types of service.
     --      As such, this table is an adjunct of the OSPF Interface
     --      Table.

     -- Types of service, as defined by RFC 791, have the ability
     -- to request low delay, high bandwidth, or reliable linkage.

     -- For the purposes of this specification, the measure of
     -- bandwidth

     --      Metric = 10^8 / ifSpeed

     -- is the default value.  For multiple link interfaces, note
     -- that ifSpeed is the sum of the individual link speeds.
     -- This yields a number having the following typical values:

     --      Network Type/bit rate   Metric

     --      >= 100 MBPS                 1
     --      Ethernet/802.3             10

     Internet Draft             OSPF MIB              November 1992


     --  OSPF Use of the IP Forwarding Table

     ospfRouteGroup     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ospf 13 }

     -- The IP Forwarding Table defines a number of objects for use by
     -- the routing protocol to externalize its information.  Most of
     -- the variables (ipForwardDest, ipForwardMask, ipForwardPolicy,
     -- ipForwardNextHop, ipForwardIfIndex, ipForwardType,
     -- ipForwardProto, ipForwardAge, and ipForwardNextHopAS) are
     -- defined there.

     -- Those that leave some discretion are defined here.

     -- ipForwardProto is, of course, ospf (13).

     -- ipForwardAge is the time since the route was first calculated,
     -- as opposed to the time since the last SPF run.

     -- ipForwardInfo is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER for use by the routing
     -- protocol.  The following values shall be found there depending
     -- on the way the route was calculated.

     ospfIntraArea      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ospfRouteGroup 1 }
     ospfInterArea      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ospfRouteGroup 2 }
     ospfExternalType1  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ospfRouteGroup 3 }
     ospfExternalType2  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ospfRouteGroup 4 }

     -- ipForwardMetric1 is, by definition, the primary routing
     -- metric.  Therefore, it should be the metric that route
     -- selection is based on.  For intra-area and inter-area routes,
     -- it is an OSPF metric.  For External Type 1 (comparable value)
     -- routes, it is an OSPF metric plus the External Metric.  For
     -- external Type 2 (non-comparable value) routes, it is the
     -- external metric.

     -- ipForwardMetric2 is, by definition, a secondary routing
     -- metric.  Therefore, it should be the metric that breaks a tie
     -- among routes having equal metric1 values and the same
     -- calculation rule.  For intra-area, inter-area routes, and
     -- External Type 1 (comparable value) routes, it is unused.  For
     -- external Type 2 (non-comparable value) routes, it is the metric
     -- to the AS border router.

     -- ipForwardMetric3, ipForwardMetric4, and ipForwardMetric5 are
     -- unused.
