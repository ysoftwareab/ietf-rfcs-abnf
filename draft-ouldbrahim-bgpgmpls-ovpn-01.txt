     Abstract 
         
        Consider a service provider network that offers Optical Virtual 
        Private Network (OVPN) service. An important goal in the OVPN 
        service is the ability to support what is known as "single end 
        provisioning", where addition of a new port to a given OVPN 
        would involve configuration/provisioning changes only on the 
        devices connected to that port. Another important goal in the 
        OVPN service is the ability to establish/terminate an optical 
        connection between a pair of (existing) ports within an OVPN 
        without involving configuration/provisioning changes in any of 
        the provider devices.  
         
        In this document we describe a set of mechanisms that 
        accomplishes these goals.

     1. Sub-IP Summary ID 
      
        This ID targets the PPVPN working group as it deals with a VPN 
        solution similar to port-based VPNs. It describes an approach 
        to allow service providers to offer optical VPN service. A pair 
        of client devices (a router, a SONET/SDH cross-connect, or an 
        Ethernet switch) could be connected through the service 
        provider network via an optical connection. It is this optical 
        connection that forms the basic unit of service that the 
        service provider network offers.

        WHERE DOES IT FIT IN THE PICTURE OF THE SUB-IP WORK 
         
        Fits the PPVPN box. 
         
        WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG 
         
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 2]

        This WG is looking at port based VPN over an IP/MPLS 
        infrastructure. This work is exactly a port-based optical VPN 
        using IP related building blocks. 
         
        JUSTIFICATION 
         
        The current PPVPN chairs have already discussed this work and 
        are considering expanding the PPVPN charter to include OVPN as 
        part of PPVPN mandate.  
      
      
     2. Optical VPN Reference Model 
      
         
        Consider a service provider network that consists of devices 
        such as Optical Network Element (ONE) which may be Optical 
        Cross Connects (OXCs). We partition these devices into P 
        (provider) ONEs and PE (provider edge) ONEs. The P ONEs are 
        connected only to the ONEs within the provider's network. The 
        PE ONEs are connected to the ONEs within the provider network, 
        as well as to the devices outside of the provider network. 
        We'll refer to such other devices as Client Edge Devices (CEs). 
        An example of a CE would be a router, or a SONET/SDH cross-
        connect, or an Ethernet switch.

        A CE is connected to a PE ONE via one or more links, where each 
        link may consists of one or more channels or sub-channels 
        (e.g.,  wavelength or wavelength and timeslot respectively). 
        For purpose of this discussion we assume that all the channels 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 3] 
                     draft-ouldbrahim-bgpgmpls-ovpn-01.txt        July 2001 
      
      
        within a given link have shared similar characteristics (e.g., 
        bandwidth, encoding, etc_), and can be interchanged from the 
        CEs point of view. Channels on different links of a CE need not 
        have the same characteristics.  

        There may be more than one link between a given CE PE ONE pair. 
        A CE may be connected to more than one PE ONE (with at least 
        one port per each PE ONE). And, of course, a PE ONE may have 
        more than one CE connected to it.  
         
        If a CE is connected to a PE ONE via multiple links and all 
        these links belong to the same VPN, then for the purpose of 
        OVPN these links could be treated as a single link using the 
        link bundling constructs [LINK-BUNDLING]. 
      
        In general a link may have only data bearing channels, or only 
        control bearing channels, or both.  For the purpose of this 
        discussion we assume that for a given CE - PE ONE pair at least 
        one of the links between them has at least one control bearing 
        channel and at least one data bearing channel. 
      
        A link has two end-points - one on CE and one on PE ONE. In the 
        context of this document we'll refer to the former as "CE 
        port", and to the latter as "PE ONE port". From the above it 
        follows that a CE is connected to a PE ONE via one or more 
        ports, where each port may consists of one or more channels or 
        sub-channels (e.g., wavelength or wavelength and timeslot 
        respectively), and all the channels within a given port have 
        shared similar characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, encoding, 
        etc_), and can be interchanged from the CEs point of view. 
        Channels on different ports of a CE need not have the same 
        characteristics. 
         
        Note that in the context of this document both ports and links 
        are logical constructs, and are used to represent grouping of 
        physical resources per OVPN basis that are used to connect a CE 
        to a PE ONE. At any given point in time, a given port on a PE 
        ONE is associated with at most one OVPN. This association is 
        established and maintained by the service provider provisioning 
        system.  
         
         
        A pair of CEs could be connected through the service provider 
        network via an optical connection. It is precisely this optical 
        connection that forms the basic unit of service that the 
        service provider network offers. If a port by which a CE is 
        connected to a PE ONE consists of multiple channels (e.g., 
        multiple wavelengths), the CE could establish optical 
        connection to multiple other CEs over this single port. 
         
        An important goal in the OVPN service is the ability to support 
        what is known as "single end provisioning", where addition of a 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 4] 
                     draft-ouldbrahim-bgpgmpls-ovpn-01.txt        July 2001 
      
      
        new port to a given OVPN would involve 
        configuration/provisioning changes only on the PE ONE that has 
        this port and on the CE that is connected to the PE ONE via 
        this port. Another important goal in the OVPN service is the 
        ability to establish/terminate an optical connection between a 
        pair of (existing) ports within an OVPN without involving 
        configuration/provisioning changes in any of the provider's 
        ONEs. The mechanisms outlined in this document aim at achieving 
        these goals. Specifically, as part of the Optical VPN service 
        offering, these mechanisms (1) enable the service provider to 
        restrict the set of ports that a given port could be connected 
        to, (2) enable the service provider to provide a CE with the 
        information about the ports that the CE could be connected, (3) 
        enable a CE to establish the actual connections to a subset of 
        ports provided by (2). Finally, the mechanisms allow different 
        OVPN topologies to be supported ranging from hub-and-spoke to 
        complete mesh. 
         
      
        The service provider does not initiate the creation of an 
        optical circuit between a pair of PE ONE ports. This is done 
        rather by the CEs, which attach to the ports. However, the SP, 
        by using the mechanisms outlined in this document, restricts 
        the set of other PE ONE ports which may be the remote endpoints 
        of optical circuits that have the given port as the local 
        endpoint. Subject to these restrictions, the CE-to-CE 
        connectivity is under the control of the CEs themselves. In 
        other words, SP allows an OVPN to have a certain set of 
        topologies, and CE-initiated signaling is used to choose a 
        particular topology from that set. 
      
         
        Since this model involves minimal provisioning changes when 
        changing the connectivity among the ports within a OVPN on the 
        providers network and the OVPNs themselves are controlled by 
        the CEs, the tariff structure may be on a port basis or 
        alternatively tariffs could be triggered on the basis of 
        signaling mechanisms. 
      
        Finally, it is assumed that CE-to-CE optical connectivity is 
        based on GMPLS [GMPLS]. 
         
         
     3. Overview of operations 
         
        This document assumes that within a given OVPN each port on a 
        CE that connects the CE to a PE ONE has an identifier that is 
        unique within that OVPN (but need not be unique across several 
        OVPNs). One way to accomplish this is to assign each port an IP 
        address that is unique within a given OVPN, and use this 
        address as a port identifier. Another way to accomplish this is 
        to assigned each port an interface index that is unique within 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 5]

        a given CE, assign each CE an IP address that is unique within 
        a given OVPN, and then use a tuple <interface index, CE IP 
        address> as a port identifier. 
      
        This document assumes that within a service provider network, 
        each port on a PE ONE has an identifier that is unique within 
        that network. One way to accomplish this would be to assign 
        each port on a PE ONE an interface index, assign each PE ONE an 
        IP address that is unique within the service provider network 
        (in the case of multi-provider operations, the address has to 
        be unique across all the providers involved), and then use a 
        tuple <interface index, PE ONE IP address> as a port identifier 
        within the provider network.

        As a result each link connecting the CE to the PE ONE is 
        associated with a CE port that has a unique identifier within a 
        given OVPN, and with a PE port that has a unique identifier 
        within the service provider network. We'll refer to the former 
        as the customer port identifier (CPI), and to the latter as the 
        provider port identifier (PPI). 
         
        This document assumes that in addition to PPI, each port on PE 
        ONE has also an identifier that is unique within the OVPN of 
        the CE connected to that port.  One way to accomplish this is 
        to assign each port an IP address that is unique within a given 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 6] 
                     draft-ouldbrahim-bgpgmpls-ovpn-01.txt        July 2001 
      
      
        OVPN, and use this address as a port identifier. Another way to 
        accomplish this is to assigned each port an interface index 
        that is unique within a given PE ONE, assign each PE ONE an IP 
        address that is unique within a given OVPN (but need not be 
        unique within the service provider network), and then use a 
        tuple <interface index, PE ONE IP address> acts as a port 
        identifier.  We'll refer to such port identifier as VPN-PPI.  
        Note that PE ONE IP address used for VPN-PPI need not be the 
        same as PE ONE IP address used for PPI, and moreover, a given 
        PE ONE may have multiple PE ONE addresses used for VPN-PPI, one 
        per OVPN. Subject to the constraints outlined in the next 
        paragraph, PPI could be used as VPN-PPI. 
         
        For a given link connecting a CE to a PE ONE, if CPI is an IP 
        address, then VPN-PPI has to be an IP address as well. And if 
        CPI is an <interface index, CPI IP address>, then VPN-PPI has 
        to be an <interface index, PE ONE IP address>. However, for a 
        given port on PE ONE, whether VPN-PPI of that port is an IP 
        address or an <interface index, PE ONE IP address> is 
        independent of whether PPI of that port is an IP address or an 
        <interface index, PE ONE IP address>. 
         
        Each PE ONE maintains a Port Information Table (PIT) for each 
        OVPN that has at least one port on that PE ONE. A PIT contains 
        a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples for all the ports within its OVPN. 
         
        A PIT on a given PE ONE is populated from two sources: the 
        information related to the CEs (optionally received from the 
        CEs) attached to the ports on that PE ONEs, and the information 
        received from other PE ONEs. We'll refer to the former as the 
        "local" information, and to the latter as the "remote" 
        information.  
         
        The local information is propagated to other PE ONEs by using 
        BGP with multi-protocol extensions. To restrict the flow of 
        this information to only the PITs within a given OVPN, we use 
        BGP route filtering based on the Route Target Extended 
        Community [BGP-COMM], as follows. 
         
        Each PIT on a PE ONE is configured with one or more Route 
        Target Communities, called "export Route Targets", that are 
        used for tagging the local information when it is exported into 
        provider's BGP. The granularity of such tagging could be as 
        fine as a single <PPI, CPI> pair. In addition, each PIT on a PE 
        ONE is configured with one or more Route Target Communities, 
        called "import Route Targets", that restrict the set of routes 
        that could be imported from provider's BGP into the PIT to only 
        the routes that have at least of these Communities.    
         
        When a service provider adds a new OVPN port to a particular PE 
        ONE, this port is associated at provisioning time with a PIT on 

      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 7] 
                     draft-ouldbrahim-bgpgmpls-ovpn-01.txt        July 2001 
      
      
        that PE ONE, and this PIT is associated (again at provisioning 
        time) with that OVPN.  
         
        Once a port is configured on the PE ONE, the CE that is 
        attached via this port to the PE ONE MAY pass to the PE ONE the 
        CPI information of that port. This document assumes that this 
        is accomplished by using BGP  (however, the document doesn't 
        preclude the use of other mechanisms).  
      
        This information, combined with the PPI information available 
        to the PE ONE, enables the PE ONE to create a tuple <CPI, PPI> 
        for such port, and then use this tuple to populate the PIT of 
        the OVPN associated with that port. 
         
        In order to establish an optical connection, a CE needs to 
        identify all other CEs in the CE's OVPN it wants to connect to. 
        A CE may already have obtained the CE list through 
        configuration or through some other schemes (such schemes are 
        outside the scope of this draft). 
         
        It is also desirable, that the service provider, as a value 
        added service, may provide a CE with a list of all other CEs in 
        the CE's OVPN. This is accomplished by passing the information 
        stored in the PE ONE PITs to the attached CE. This document 
        assumes that this is accomplished by using BGP Multi-protocol 
        extensions (however this draft doesn't preclude other 
        mechanisms to be used). Although optional, this draft 
        recommends the PE to signal to the attached CEs the remote CPIs 
        it learnt from the remote CEs part of the same OVPN. A CE may 
        decide to initiate an optical connection request to a remote CE 
        only when it learn the CPI of the remote CE from the PE. This 
        has the benefit to avoid rejecting connection request while the 
        PE is populating the PITs. 
         
        Once a CE obtains the information about the CPIs of other ports 
        within the same OVPN, which we'll refer to as "target ports", 
        the CE uses a (subset of) GMPLS signaling to request the 
        provider network to establish an optical connection to a target 
        port. Note that this draft assumes that GMPLS is only used to 
        establish optical connections between client devices. 
         
        The request originated by the CE contains the CPI of the port 
        on the CE that CE wants to use for the optical connection, and 
        the CPI of the target port. When the PE ONE attached to the CE 
        that originated the request receives the request, the PE ONE 
        identifies the appropriate PIT, and then uses the information 
        in that PIT to find out the PPI associated with the CPI of the 
        target port carried in the request. The PPI should be 
        sufficient for the PE ONE to establish an optical connection. 
        Ultimately the request reaches the CE associated with the 
        target CPI (note that the request still carries the CPI of the 
        CE that originated the request). If the CE associated with the 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 8] 
                     draft-ouldbrahim-bgpgmpls-ovpn-01.txt        July 2001 
      
      
        target CPI accepts the request, the optical connection is 
        established.  
         
        Note that a CE need not establish an optical connection to 
        every target port that CE knows about - it is a local to the CE 
        matter to select a subset of target ports to which the CE will 
        try to establish optical connections. 
         
        A port, in addition to its CPI and PPI may also have other 
        information associated with it that describes characteristics 
        of the channels within that port, such as encoding supported by 
        the channels, bandwidth of a channel, total unreserved 
        bandwidth within the port, etc. This information could be 
        further augmented with the information about certain 
        capabilities of the Service Provider network (e.g., support 
        RSOH DCC transparency, arbitrary concatenation, etc_). This 
        information is used to ensure that ports at each end of an 
        optical connection have compatible characteristics, and that 
        there are sufficient unallocated resources to establish an 
        optical connection. Distribution of this information (including 
        the mechanisms for distributing this information) is identical 
        to the distribution of the <CPI, PPI> information. Distributing 
        changes to this information due to establishing/terminating of 
        optical connections is identical to the distribution of the 
        <CPI, PPI> information, except that thresholds should be used 
        to contain the volume of control traffic caused by such 
        distribution.  
         
        It may happen that for a given pair of ports within an OVPN, 
        each of the CEs connected to these ports would concurrently try 
        to establish an optical connection to the other CE. If having a 
        pair of optical connections between a pair of ports is viewed 
        as undesirable, the a way to resolve this is have CE with the 
        lower value of CPI is required to terminate the optical 
        connection originated by the CE. This option could be 
        controlled by configuration on the CE devices. 
         
         
     4. Encoding  
         
        This section specifies encoding of various information defined 
        in this document.

     Ould-Brahim, et al.          January 2002                     [Page 9] 
                     draft-ouldbrahim-bgpgmpls-ovpn-01.txt        July 2001 
      
      
        The <CPI, PPI> mapping is carried using the Multiprotocol 
        Extensions BGP [RFC2858]. [RFC2858] defines the format of two 
        BGP attributes, MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI that can be 
        used to announce and withdraw the announcement of reachability 
        information. We introduce a new address family identifier (AFI) 
        for OVPN (to be assigned by the IANA), a new subsequent address 
        family identifier (to be assigned by the IANA), and also a new 
        NLRI format for carrying the CPI and PPI information. 
      
        One or more <PPI, CPI> tuples could be carried in the above 
        mentioned BGP attributes.  
      
        The format of encoding a single <PPI, CPI> tuple is shown in  
        Figure 3 below:

          The use and meaning of these fields are as follows: 
      
              Length:  
         
                 A one octet field whose value indicates the length of 
             the   
                 <PPI, CPI> Information tuple in octets. 
      
              PPI AFI: 
      
                A two octets field whose value indicates address  
                family identifier of PPI

                A one octet field whose value indicates the length of  
                of the PPI field

              PPI field:  
      
                A variable length field that contains the value of  
                the PPI (either an address or <interface index,  
                address> tuple  
      
              CPI AFI field:  
      
                A two octets field whose value indicates address  
                family of the CPI. 
      
              CPI Length:  
      
                A once octet field whose value indicates the  
                length of the CPI field. 
      
              CPI (variable):  
          
                A variable length field that contains the CPI  
                value (either an address or <interface index, address> 
                tuple. 
      
     4.2.2 Encoding channel characteristics in BGP 
      
        [TBD] 
      
     5. Other issues 
      
        While the above text assumes that the service provider network 
        consists of ONEs and ports are connected via optical 
        connections, the mechanisms described in this document could be 
        applied in an environment, where the service provider network 
        consists of SONET/SDH cross connects and CE ports being either 
        SONET/SDH or Ethernet. 
         
        Since the protocol used to populate a PIT with remote 
        information is BGP, since BGP works across multiple routing 
        domains, and since GMPLS signaling isn't restricted to a single 
        routing domain, it follows that the mechanisms described in 
        this document could support an environment that consists of 
        multiple routing domains.  
         
        The mechanisms described in this document allow for a wide 
        range of choices with respect to addresses used for CPI, PPI, 
        and VPN-PPI. For example, one could use either IPv4 addresses, 
        or IPv6 addresses, or NSAPs. Different OVPN customers of a 
        given service provider may use different types of addresses. 
        Moreover, different OVPNs attaching to the same PE ONE may use 
        different addressing schemes. The types of addresses used for 
        PPIs within a given service provider network are independent 
        from the type of addresses used for CPI and VPN-PPI by the OVPN 
        customers of that provider.
