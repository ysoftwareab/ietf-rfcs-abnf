 1. Introduction 

    Mobile multicast is a research hotspot, and some mobile multicast 
    schemes were proposed in past few years. MIPv4 [2] describes two 
    basic mobile multicast methods: (1) Bi-directional Tunnel (BT), (2) 
    Remote Subscribe (RS), while both of them have advantages and

    disadvantages. Later, some improved mobile schemes were proposed to 
    integrate the advantages of BT and RS. More recently, with the 
    development of MIPv6 [3], FMIPv6 [7] and HMIPv6 [8] were proposed to 
    improve the handover performance. FMIPv6 configures the New CoA 
    before L2 handover to reduce the handover delay, while HMIPv6 
    introduces a mobility anchor point (MAP) as a local HA to eliminate 
    the overhead of global handover signaling.  

    K. Suh et al. [9] propose the fast multicast protocol for Mobile IPv6 
    in the fast handovers environment (M-FMIPv6) which uses the unicast 
    tunnel between PAR and NAR to forward the multicast data during the 
    handover. Similar to M-FMIPv6, F. Xia and B. Sarikaya [10] propose 
    the FMIPv6 extension for multicast handover, which extends a new 
    option, Multicast Group Information Option (MGIO) in FBU and HI. It 
    transmits MLD state by FBU and HI to NAR and establishes the 
    multicast delivery trees before MN move into the NAR. Based on M-
    FMIPv6, Georigios A. Leoleis et al. [11] propose the Fast MIPv6 
    extensions for Multicast support with Flow Tunneling and Buffering 
    (M-FMIPv6/FTB). It uses the conditional tunneling on per multicast 
    traffic flow to solve the tunnel convergence and buffering technique 
    to eliminate multicast packets loss. Thomas Schmidt and Matthias 
    Waehlisch [12] propose a seamless multicast handover in a HMIPv6 
    environment (M-HMIPv6), which uses the MAP as multicast anchor point 
    and transmits all multicast data through it. Zhang et al [13] propose 
    a MIPv6 multicast scheme with dynamic multicast agent (DMA), it 
    combines movement based method and distance based method to select 
    new multicast agent dynamically to reduce the handoff frequency.  

    As discussed above, most mobile multicast schemes are based on single 
    interface to perform multicast handover, which is less stable and 
    reliable. Once MN or MR lost its connection, performance of mobile 
    multicast will degrade significantly. As a result, it cannot realize 
    the seamless multicast handover.  

    Recently, the multihoming issues in MIPv6 [14] [15] and NEMO [16] 
    were discussed. MN with multiple addresses which allocated to either 
    a single interface or multiple interfaces can provide ubiquitous, 
    permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet. The multihoming 
    techniques used for mobile multicast can derive these advantages. 
    While the current MIPv6 and NEMO specification cannot provide these 
    functions. They only support MN to register to HA or CN with one CoA 
    (noted as primary CoA). To solve this problem, R. Wakikawa et al [17] 
    proposed MIPv6 extensions designed to register multiple CoA bound to 
    a single HoA instead of the sole primary CoA, which introduced 
    Binding Unique Identification number (BID) to distinguish the 
    multiple binding entries registered by HA or CN. And it also can be 
    used in NEMO.

    In this memo, we discuss the multihomed problems in mobile multicast 
    and propose a multiple interfaces mobile multicast scheme. The 
    interfaces in the MN may have the same HA or different HAs. MN can 
    set up multiply tunnels with HA and transmit the multicast data 
    through these physical interfaces or tunnels. This scheme can be used 
    not only in MIPv6, FMIPv6 and HMIPv6, but also in NEMO.

 3. Overview of multiple interfaces mobile multicast 

    Fig.1 shows the multiple interfaces mobile multicast deployment 
    scenario. MN has two interfaces (noted as IF1 and IF2) and signal HA. 
    Based on IF1 and IF2, MN setup two tunnels (noted as L-Tunnel1 and L-
    Tunnel2) between MN and HA. Besides, MN also creates two tunnels (S-
    Tunnel1 and S-Tunnel2) between PAR and NAR (noted as PAR-IF1/NAR-IF1 
    and PAR-IF2/NAR-IF2 respectively).  

    The main idea is to integrate the BT and RS methods and insure that 
    at least one interface can transmit the multicast data during 
    movement. MN maintains an interface multicast state list and a 
    multicast group forwarding list to assist the multicast data 
    transmission. The proposed scheme includes interface selection, 
    interface multicast state transition, and multiple interfaces 
    interaction.

            Figure 1 Multiple interfaces mobile multicast scenario  

    Some assumptions show as following.  

    o MIPv6 (or NEMO) supports multihoming; 
  
  
 Zhang et al            Expires December 30, 2007               [Page 5] 
     
 Internet-Draft            multipleif-mcast                   June 2007 
     

    o MN has multiply interfaces; 

    o At lest one interfaces can provide Internet access; 

    Every interface has different priority based on the pre-defined 
    policies such as bandwidth, cost and load. MN uses the interface with 
    the highest priority to transmit the multicast data at the beginning. 
    Before the high prior interface lose its attachment (Link down or 
    interface down), MN will redirect its multicast data to the secondary 
    prior interface. MN records the group membership and forwarding 
    information for every interface to accomplish the flow redirect.  

    MN selects the BT or RS based on whether the AR that MN attached 
    supports multicast or not. Multicast Router Discovery (MRD) [6] 
    provides a general mechanism that allows for the discovery of 
    multicast routers. If the AR can provide the multicast services, MN 
    will send unsolicited MLD report or multicast data (when MN is a 
    multicast source). Otherwise, MN will transmit the multicast by BT 
    method. There are two kinds of tunnel used in BT. The first kind is 
    the tunnel between HA and MN which setup by MIPv6, noted as L-Tunnel 
    which has long lifetime. When MN leaves its home networks far away, 
    L-Tunnel will have long path and large transmission overheads. The 
    second kind is the tunnel between PAR and NAR, noted as S-Tunnel 
    which has short lifetime and short path. The tunnel between PAR and 
    NAR described in FMIPv6 can be classified to S-Tunnel. MN uses the S-
    Tunnel to reduce the packets lost during the handover.  

    When multiply interfaces with different preferences can access to 
    Internet and provide multicast services, MN should decide to use 
    which of the available interfaces. The detailed process is described 
    in Section 4.  

 4. The detailed process of multiple interfaces mobile multicast  

 4.1. List information in MN 

 4.1.1. Interface multicast state list  

    MN maintains multicast state for every interface, and determines the 
    transmission interface of the multicast data.  

    The record entry consists of several fields as follows: 

    o IF-Name: the name of network interfaces, for example eth0 means 
       the first Ethernet interface. 

    o IF-ID: the interface system ID. 
  
  
 Zhang et al            Expires December 30, 2007               [Page 6] 
     
 Internet-Draft            multipleif-mcast                   June 2007 
     

    o IF-Priority: the value to indicate the priority of interface used 
       for interface selection. 

    o Interface Address: the global IPv6 address of interface. L-tunnel 
       uses the HoA, while the S-Tunnel uses the NCoA.  

    o Multicast Address: the multicast group MN joined. 

    o Multicast State: BT state, RS state or Idle state.  

    o Multicast source address list: record the source addresses for SSM 
       mode.  

    o Filter mode: INCLUDE or EXCLUDE mode for SSM.  

 4.1.2. Multicast forwarding interfaces list 

    For a given multicast group, MN maintains a multicast forwarding 
    interface list. It is used to verify the incoming multicast data and 
    select the interface when MN is a multicast source. The record form 
    is shown as following. 

    o Multicast Address 

    o Multicast Source Address List 

    o Filter Mode 

    o Interface Address list 

 4.2. Interface selection 

    MN may access to different networks through different network 
    interfaces to get different network services simultaneously. These 
    networks can be WPAN (e.g. 802.15), WLAN (e.g. IEEE 802.11), WMAN 
    (e.g. IEEE 802.16e), and WWAN (e.g. 2G/3G) which have different 
    bandwidth, coverage range, cost etc. MN chooses the interface based 
    on the requirement of the applications. A policy determination 
    mechanism can be introduced to compute the priority of interfaces. 
    For example if MN has a WLAN card and CDMA2000 card, it can set the 
    WLAN as the default network interface to provide the network service, 
    and switch to CDMA2000 interface when no WLAN coverage. The detailed 
    Policy determination mechanism is out of this memo.

 4.3. Interface multicast state transition 

    Every interface has two multicast states, bi-directional tunnel state 
    (noted BT state) when multicast data transmitted by L-Tunnel or S-
    Tunnel with multiply IPv6 headers, and remote subscribe state (noted 
    RS state) when multicast data transmitted through physical interface 
    with one IPv6 header. Assume the state no multicast data transmission 
    is idle state, and then we can get the interface has three multicast 
    states, BT state, RS state and Idle state.  

    An important issue should be addressed is the source address 
    selection of MLD report message. As described in [5], the MLDv2 
    Report message MUST be sent with a valid IPv6 link-local source 
    address, or the unspecified address (::), if the sending interface 
    has not acquired a valid link-local address yet. However, MIPv6 
    specification indicates that MN should send an MLD Report message 
    with a CoA which is a global IPv6 address. In this memo, the 
    multicast data transmission is based on the source address of 
    unsolicited MLD Report message. When BT method is used, MN chooses 
    the HoA as the source address. As for the RS method, MN chooses the 
    global IPv6 address (CoA) as the source address.  

    Assume that interface has no multicast data to transmit (Idle state) 
    at first, and the state transition diagram is shown as fig.1.

            Figure 2 Interface multicast state transition diagram 

    There are several trigger events that can cause multicast state 
    transitions shown in fig.2.  

    0. "No MLD report messages received in the network interface" when MN 
       does not join any multicast group; 

    1. "MN joins the group at Home networks" when MN is similar to fixed 
       node.  

    2. "The interface does not change the attachment point". 

    3. "MN move into the foreign networks and no interfaces in RS state". 

    4. "MN does not receive the Group Forwarding Update (noted as GFU) 
       message" which means the foreign networks does not support 
       multicast and MN only transmit the multicast data through L-Tunnel 
       or S-Tunnel. The GFU message is introduced to notify the other 
       interfaces to stop forwarding the relative groups data according 
       to the information included in the GFU.  

    5. "MN received the GFU message or MLD done message" which means the 
       interface has no multicast states for the multicast group included 
       in the message.

    6. "Join the group through the L-Tunnel or S-Tunnel" which means the 
       current AR does not provide multicast service. 

    7. "Join the group through the physical network interface". 

    8. "MN Receive the MLD done message" which means MN leaves the 
       multicast group.  

    For different multicast groups joined in the interface, MN may be in 
    different multicast state at the same time.  

 4.4. Multiply interfaces interaction 

    For the given multicast session in the MN, the multicast data flow 
    will transmit through different interfaces when MN moves. In this 
    section, we will discuss the interface interaction procedure assuming 
    that MN has two network interfaces attaching to different ARs, noted 
    as IF1 and IF2 (Support that IF1 has higher priority than IF2).  

    Assume that MN joined a multicast group from IF1 in BT state at first, 
    and we can get the operation flow of multiple interfaces mobile 
    multicast. The policy of the interface selection is that IF1 and RS 
    state is preferential.

    1. IF1 will detect whether its attachment point changed (similar to 
       the movement detection process as described in MIPv6). If IF1 
       changed its attachment point and attach to a new AR (NAR-IF1), it 
       will perform multicast handover and rejoin the multicast group, 
       change the IF1 multicast state based on whether NAR-IF1 support 
       multicast or not. This can be done by capturing packets from the 
       AR to analysis if MLD query message exist or using the multicast 
       router solicitation described MRD. If NAR-IF1 has the multicast 
       function, it will join the multicast group before sending MLD done 
       message through the tunnel, otherwise it will join the group 
       through the S-Tunnel between previous AR (PAR-IF1) and NAR-IF1. 

    2. If MN moved into the area which IF1 can not attach to any AR, the 
       IF2 will detect new ARs and judge whether the current AR support 
       multicast. MN will repeat this process until it finds the AR with 
       the multicast function  and then it will send MLD report message 
       to join the multicast group.  

    3. Once MN joins the group from IF2 with RS method, it will redirect 
       its multicast data flow to IF2. If IF1 rejoins the group again, MN 
       will transmit the multicast data through IF1 with RS method (RS 
       state).  

    4. If IF1 can not attach to any AR and IF2 accesses to the new AR 
       (NAR-IF2), it will transmit the multicast data from the tunnel set 
       up between pervious AR (PAR-IF2) and NAR-IF2.  

    5. If NAR-IF2 supports multicast, MN will change its multicast state 
       before it sends MLD done message from the tunnel. 

    6. If IF1 rejoins the group again, MN will transmit the multicast 
       data through IF1 with RS method (RS state).  

    7. After MN receives multicast data from IF1, it will perform 
       movement detection process. If IF1 attaches to a new AR, it will 
       transmit the multicast data through the tunnel between PAR-IF1 and 
       NAR-IF2 (setp0). If NAR-IF1 support multicast, MN will change its 
       multicast state before it sends MLD done message from the tunnel 
       (step1). 

 5. Message format 

    As described above, the GFU message is introduced to inform the other 
    interfaces to stop forwarding the relative groups data according to 
    the information included in the GFU. It is used among interfaces to 
    update the interface multicast state list and multicast forwarding 
    interfaces list.

    The message format is TBD. 

 6. Security Considerations 

    This memo discusses a multiple interfaces based mobile multicast 
    scheme. Unlike the single interface mobile multicast methods, it uses 
    multiple interfaces to transmit the multicast data based on basic BT 
    and RS methods. Security issues arise from the MIPv6 and BT or RS 
    methods. Further security considerations will be carefully studied 
    with the update of the memo.  

 7. IANA Considerations 

    There are no IANA considerations introduced by this memo. In the 
    future, we MAY extend one ICMPv6 message (TBD). 

 8. Conclusions 

    This memo discusses the multihomed mobile multicast that MN has 
    multiple interfaces. It sets up three multicast stats in each 
    interface for every multicast group and describes the interface 
    multicast state transition diagram. A detailed multiple interfaces 
    mobile multicast produce is given.
