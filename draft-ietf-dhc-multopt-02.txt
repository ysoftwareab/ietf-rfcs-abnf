1. Abstract

   This document describes host configuration options that may be used
   by multicast address allocation protocols[3]. The options include
   critical information such as the multicast address
   of the multicast address allocation server(s) and a list of
   multicast scopes supported by respective servers. These options are
   designed to work with the extensions to DHCP [1] servers to support
   multicast address allocation (described in a separate draft),
   however, their use may not be limited to the above protocol.

2 Requirements

   Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the
   significance of particular requirements are capitalized.  These
   words are:

      o "MUST"

        This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the
        item is an absolute requirement of this specification.

Patel & Shah                                                    [Page 1]

      o "MUST NOT"

        This phrase means that the item is an absolute prohibition
        of this specification.

      o "SHOULD"

        This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there
        may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore
        this item, but the full implications should be understood and
        the case carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

      o "SHOULD NOT"

        This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons in
        particular circumstances when the listed behavior is acceptable
        or even useful, but the full implications should be understood
        and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior
        described with this label.

      o "MAY"

        This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item is
        truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
        because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
        enhances the product, for example; another vendor may omit the
        same item.

3 Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

      o "DHCP client"

        A DHCP client is an Internet host using DHCP to obtain
        configuration parameters such as a network address.

      o "DHCP server"

        A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns configuration
        parameters to DHCP clients.

      o "MDHCP client"

        A MDHCP client is a DHCP client that supports MDHCP extensions.

      o "MDHCP server"

        A MDHCP server is a DHCP server that supports MDHCP extensions.

Patel & Shah                                                    [Page 2]

4 Multicast Address Allocation Configuration Options

   Any client attempting to request a multicast address must know the
   multicast group address to which the server is listening to and a
   list of multicast scopes supported by the multicast address servers.
   The following two options are specifically designed to provide the
   multicast address server address and the scope list that can
   specifically be used by the protocol described in [3], however, its
   use is not limited to the protocol described in [3].

4.1 Multicast Group Address of MDHCP Servers.

   This option is used DHCP servers to provide the multicast group
   address of the MDHCP servers. The MDHCP client can obtain this
   parameter as part of the normal DHCP protocol message exchange or
   separately via DHCPINFORM.

	 Code  Len      Multicast Address
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | TBD | 4   | i1  | i2  | i3  | i4  |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   The code for this option is TBD and the length is 4.

4.2 Multicast Scople List Option.

   The format of the multicast scope list option is:

         Code  Len      IP Address           Count  List
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-...-+-----+
        | 107 | n   | i1  | i2  | i3  | i4  | N   | l1  |     | ln  |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-...-+-----+


   Where IP address is the address of the MDHCP server, to its best
   knowledge, reachable from the client via unicast.
   The scope list a list of N tuples, where each tuple is of
   the form,

        Scope ID ( 4 Bytes )    TTL   Desc  Scope Description.
                                       Len
       +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-...-+-----+
       | ID1 | ID2 | ID3 | ID4 | T   | n   | d1  |     | dn  |
       +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-...-+-----+


   where scope ID is a unique identifier to designate the scope,
   TTL is the multicast TTL value for the multicast addresses of
   the scope, scope
   description is a string describing the scope (need not be null
   terminated) and scope len is the length of scope description.

Patel & Shah                                                    [Page 3]

   Scope id is numeric representation of the scope and is used by the
   client to indicate a multicast scope to the server. In order to
   keep the usage of scope id consistent in the MBONE, this draft
   SHOULD be coordinated with [3] reserve a scope id for each
   multicast range in [3]. The scope id with its MSB(most significant
   bit) of 1 should be used for administratively scoped multicast
   address range. And the scope id with its MSB of 0 should be used to
   represent other pre-defined internet scopes.

   The code for this option is 107.

   Example:

   The IP address of the MDHCP server is 10.1.1.1. There are two
   scopes supported by the multicast address allocation server:
   1) Inside the abcd.com, 2) world. Then this option will be used as:


         Code  Len      IP Address           Count
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 107 | 32  | 10  | 1   | 1   | 1   | 2   |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

        Scope ID    TTL Len Desc
       +--+--+--+--+---+---+--+--+-...-+--+--+
       |         1 |10 |16 | Inside abcd.com |
       +--+--+--+--+---+---+--+--+-...-+--+--+
       |         2 |16 |5  | world           |
       +--+--+--+--+---+---+--+--+-...-+--+--+
