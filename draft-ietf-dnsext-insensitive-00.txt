Abstract

   Domain Name System (DNS) names are "case insensitive". This document
   explains exactly what that means and provides a clear specification
   of the rules. This clarification should not have any interoperability
   consequences.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    DNS Case Insensitivity


1. Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global hierarchical replicated
   distributed database system for Internet addressing, mail proxy, and
   other information. Each node in the DNS tree has a name consisting of
   zero or more labels [STD 13][RFC 1591, 2606] which have always been
   specified as being treated in a case insensitive fashion. This
   document clarifies the meaning of "case insensitive" for this
   application.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].



2. Case Insensitivity of DNS Labels

   DNS was specified in the era of [ASCII]. DNS names were expected to
   look like most host names or Internet email address right halves (the
   part after the at-sign ("@")) or be numeric as in the in-addr.arpa
   part of the DNS name space. For example,

       foo.example.net.
       aol.com.
       www.gnu.ai.mit.edu.
   or  69.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

   Case varied alternatives to the above would be DNS names like

       Foo.ExamplE.net.
       AOL.COM.
       WWW.gnu.AI.mit.EDU.
   or  69.2.0.192.in-ADDR.ARPA.

   The individual bytes of which DNS names consist are not limited to
   valid ASCII character codes. They are defined as 8-bit bytes and all
   values are allowed. It is just that they are traditionally interpreted
   as ASCII characters.

   The typographic convention for bytes that do not correspond to an
   ASCII printing graphic is to show them as a back-slash followed by
   three hex digits for the value of the byte as an unsigned
   integer. This includes all byte values outside of the inclusive range
   of 0x21 ("!") to 0x7E ("~"). That is to say, all byte values in the
   two inclusive ranges 0x00 to 0x20 and 0x7F to 0xFF. The same
   convention can be used for the back-slash character and the special
   label separator period ("."). A period can also be protected from
   recognition as a separator, so that it will be treated as a normal
   label character, by preceeding it with a back-slash. The first example

   below shows embedded spaces and a period (".") within a label. The
   second one show a 4 byte label where the second byte has all bits zero
   and the third byte has all bits one.

       Donald\040E\.\040Eastlake\0403rd.example.
   or  a\000\377z.example.

   The design decision was made that comparisons on name lookup for DNS
   queries should be case insensitive [STD 13]. That is to say, a lookup
   string byte with a value in the inclusive range of 0x41 to 0x5A, the
   upper case ASCII letters, MUST match the identical value and also
   match the corresponding value in the inclusive range 0x61 to 0x7A,
   the lower case ASCII letters. And a lookup string byte with a lower
   case ASCII letter value MUST similarly match the identical value and
   also match the corresponding value in the upper case ASCII letter
   range. One way to implement this rule would be, when comparing bytes,
   to subtract 0x20 from all bytes in the inclusive range 0x61 to 0x7A
   before the comparison. Such an operation is commonly known as "case
   folding".

   (Historic Note: the terms "upper case" and "lower case" were invented
   after movable type became wide spread for printing.  The terms
   originally refered to the two font trays for storing, in partitioned
   areas, the different physical type elements.  Before movable type,
   the nearest equivalent terms were "majuscule" and "minuscule".)

   DNS labels in wire encoded names have a type associated with them.
   The original DNS standard [RFC 1035] had only two types. ASCII
   labels, with a length of from zero to 63 bytes and indirect labels
   which consist of an offset pointer to a name location elsewhere in
   the wire encoding. (The ASCII label of length zero is reserved for
   use as the name of the root node of the name tree.) ASCII labels
   follow the ASCII case conventions described above. Indirect labels
   are, in effect, replaced by the name to which they point which is
   then treated with the case insensitivity rules in this document.



3. Additional DNS Case Insensitivity Considerations

   This section clarifies the effect of DNS CLASS and extended Label
   Type on case insensitivity.



3.1 CLASS Case Insensitivity Considerations

   As described in [STD 13] and [RFC 2929], DNS has an additional axis
   for data location called CLASS. The only CLASS in global use at this
   time is the "IN" or Internet CLASS.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    DNS Case Insensitivity


   The handling of DNS label case is not CLASS dependent.



3.2 Label Type Case Insensitivity Considerations

   DNS was extended by [RFC 2671] to have additional label type numbers
   available. (The only such type defined so far it the BINARY type [RFC
   2673].)

   The ASCII case insensitivity conventions, or case folding, only apply
   to ASCII labels, that is to say, label type 0x0, whether appearing
   directly or invoked by indirect labels.



4. Case on Input and Output

   While ASCII label comparisons are case insensitive, case MUST be
   preserved on output, except when output is optimized by the use of
   indirect labels, and preserved when possible on input.

   [STD 13] views the DNS namespace as a node tree. ASCII output is as
   if a name was marshalled by taking the label on the node whose name
   is to be output, converting it to a typographicly encoded ASCII
   string, walking up the tree outputting each label encountered, and
   preceeding all labels but the first with a period ("."). Wire output
   follows the same sequence but each label is wire encoded and no
   periods inserted. No "case conversion" or "case folding" is done
   during such output operations.  However, to optimize output, indirect
   labels may be used to point to names elsewhere in the DNS answer. In
   determining whether the name to be pointed to is the "same" as the
   remainder of the name being optimized, the case insensitive
   comparison specified above is done. Thus such optimization MAY
   destroy the output preservation of case. This type of optimization is
   commonly called "name compression".

   Originally, DNS input came from an ASCII Master File as defined in
   [STD 13]. DNS Dynamic update has been added as a source of DNS data
   [RFC 2136, 3007]. When a node in the DNS name tree is created by such
   input, no case conversion is done and the case of ASCII labels is
   preserved if they are for nodes being creted. However, no change is
   made in the name label on nodes that already exist is the DNS data
   being augmented or updated. It is quite common for higher level nodes
   to already exist. For example, if data with owner name
   "foo.bar.example" is input and then later data with owner name
   "xyz.BAR.example" is input, the name of the label on the
   "bar.example" node, i.e. "bar", is not changed to "BAR". Thus later
   retrieval of data stored under "xyz.bar.example" in this case can
   easily result is obtaining data with "xyz.BAR.example".

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    DNS Case Insensitivity


   Note that the order of insertion into a server database of the DNS
   name tree nodes that appear in a Master File is not defined so that
   the results of inconsistent capitalization in a Master File are
   unpredicatable output capitalization.

   There is one additional instance of note, which reflects the general
   rules that output case reflects input case unless there is
   conflicting capitalization in the DNS database or the output case is
   hidden by name compression. This is when a query matches a wild card
   in the DNS database at a server. In that case, the answer SHOULD
   reflect the input case of the label or labels that matched the
   wildcard unless they are replaced by an indirect label which MAY
   point to a name with different captialization.



5. Security Considerations

   The equivalence of certain DNS label types with case differences, as
   clarified in this document, can lead to security problems. For
   example, a user could be confused by believing two domain names
   differing only in case were actually different names.

   Furthermore, a domain name may be used in contexts other than the
   DNS.  It could be used as an index into some case sensitive data base
   system. Or it could be interpreted as binary data by some integrity
   or authentication code system. These problems can usually be handled
   by using a standardized or "canonical" form of the DNS ASCII type
   labels, that is, always map the ASCII letter value octets in ASCII
   labels to some specific pre-chosen case, either upper case or lower
   case. An example of a canonical form for domain names (and also a
   canonical ordering for them) appears in Section 8 of [RFC 2535]. See
   also [UNKRR].
