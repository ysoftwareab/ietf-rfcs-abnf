Abstract

     Explicit Multicast (Xcast) is a newly proposed multicast scheme to
     support a very large number of small multicast groups. Current
     Xcast specification mentions its data plane only, and does not
     specify a control plane. Therefore, this document describes an
     enhanced scheme for the support of receiver initiated join in
     explicit multicast, named Xcast extension (Xcast+), which
     complements the existing Xcast. This is achieved by adding an IGMP
     join at receiver side and sending the join request through source-
     specific join to the sender, and then by explicitly encoding the
     list of address of the multicast routers, instead of receiver
     address. Xcast+ encoding of the destination list in IPv4 and IPv6
     are the same as Xcast. Whereas Xcast can support a very large
     number of small multicast groups, Xcast+ can support a very large
     number of medium size multicast groups.

1. Introduction

     Explicit Multicast (Xcast) is a newly proposed multicast scheme to
     support a very large number of small multicast groups. Xcast uses
     explicit encoding of destination list in the data packets, instead
     of multicast address. The source encodes the list of destinations
     in the Xcast header, and then sends the packet to a router. Each
     router along the way parses the header, partitions the destinations
     based on each destination's next hop, and forwards a packet with an
     appropriate Xcast header to each of the next hops [1].

     Current Xcast specification mentions a data plane only, and does
     not specify a 'control plane'. Therefore, defining multicast
     sessions is an application level issue[1]. There will be multiple
     ways in which an Xcast sender determines the addresses of the other
     members of the session. For example, SIP[2] and IGMP-like
     receiver-join model can be used.

     This document describes an enhanced scheme for the support of
     receiver initiated join in explicit multicast, named Explicit
     Multicast extension (Xcast+). This is achieved by adding IGMP (S,
     G) join at a receiver side and sending the join request through
     PIM-SSM [3, 4] like source-specific join (S, G) to the sender in
     the control plane. When the sender receives the join request, it
     explicitly encodes the list of address of the multicast router in
     the data packets, instead of addresses of receivers. Xcast+
     encoding of the destination list in IPv4 and IPv6 are the same as
     Xcast[1].

     With Xcast+, there are a few extensions of Xcast. They are the use
     of standard multicast addresses for receiver initiated join and the
     use of encoded addresses of the multicast routers in the data
     packets, instead of receiver addresses. These extensions to Xcast

     will result in the following benefits :


     -    From the viewpoint of receivers, procedures in the control
          plane are the same to existing ISM and SSM schemes. Therefore,
          Xcast+ receivers do not need to use additional control to join
          in Xcast+ session. This means the control plane of Xcast+ is
          compatible with the existing ISM and SSM. A receiver that is
          an IGMP capable host does not need to be an Xcast+ capable
          host.

     -    There can be an increase of the number of members, which means
          Xcast+ can support medium size number of members compared to
          that of existing Xcast. Whereas Xcast can support a very large
          number of small multicast groups, Xcast+ can support a very
          large number of medium size multicast groups.

     -    Similar to ALM(Application Level Multicast) and Overlay
          Multicast schemes, Xcast+ supports both multicast and unicast,
          where multicast is used in subnet and unicast is used between
          routers. Therefore, this will result in a more efficient and
          scalable mechanism to allow to increase the number of
          receivers in a subnet.

     -    When the scalability in ISM schemes is considered, one of the
          main issues may be complexity of multicast tree construction
          between multicast routers on Internet backbone. Because Xcast+
          uses the multicast scheme in a subnet level only, deployment
          and management are easy and simple, even if multicast scheme
          is used.

     Note - Extension (plus) of Xcast+ means the support of receiver
     initiated IGMP join and the use of encoded address of the multicast
     router in the data packets, instead of receiver address.

                     subnet router
                     It does not mean the source-specific join of
                     PIM-SSM


2. Xcast+ Overview

     In Xcast+, a receiver initiates IGMP join. (Current version of
     IGMP, IGMPv3[5] can support join of (S, G).) When a multicast
     router receives the request, it sends source-specific join to the
     sender. These procedures imply the addition of control plane for
     Xcast. Then, the sender keeps track of the addresses of routers
     that send source-specific join messages in the multicast session.
     The sender encodes the list of router addresses in the Xcast+
     header, and then sends the packet to a router. Each router along
     the way parses the header, partitions the destinations based on
     each destination's next hop, and forwards a packet with an
     appropriate Xcast+ header to each of the next hops. These
     procedures comply with the data plane for existing Xcast except for
     encoding addresses of the multicast routers in the data packets,
     instead of addresses of receivers.

     For example, suppose that B, C, D, E, F and G are trying to receive
     packets distributed from A in Figure 1 below:


                                B
                               /
                              R4 -- C
                             /                    D
                            /                    /
      A --- R1 --- R2 --- R3                    R8 -- E
                            \                  / \
                             \                /   F
                              R5 --- R6 --- R7
                                              \
                                               \
                                                R9 -- G

                                  Figure 1

     This is accomplished as follows:

     B, C, D, E, F and G initiate IGMP join. When R4, R8 and R9 receive
     the request, they send source-specific join to the A. A sends an
     Xcast+ packet with the list of multicast routers (R4, R8 and R9) in
     its Xcast+ header to the first router, R1.

     Xcast+ encoding of the destination list in IPv4 and IPv6 are the
     same as Xcast. Therefore, ignoring details, the packet that A sends
     to R1 looks like this:





Myung-Ki Shin et al.      Expires August 2001                   [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT Xcast+ Supporting Receiver Initiated Join   February 2001


            [ src = A | dest = R4 R8 R9 | payload ]

     When R1 receives this packet, it needs to properly process the
     Xcast+ header. The processing that a router does on receiving one
     of these Xcast+ packets is exactly the same to Xcast except for the
     following processing.


     -    Addition of X2M encoding processing (Xcast+ header to
          Multicast header):  If the address of destination is equal to
          the address of the router (i.e. the router is the subnet
          multicast router that received receiver initiated join from
          receiver), the router sends the packet as a standard multicast
          packet to the receivers (X2M). X2M is performed at IGMP (S, G)
          enabled interface only of final router in on the delivery
          path.


     -    Deletion of X2U encoding processing (Xcast+ header to Unicast
          header): Unlike existing Xcast, even if there is only one
          destination for a particular next hop, do NOT send the packet
          as a standard unicast packet to the destination (X2U), because
          destination address (i.e. standard multicast address) in IP
          header is meaningful when X2M encoding is used.

     Therefore, the whole processing algorithm that a router does on
     receiving an Xcast+ packet is as follows :


     1)   Perform a route table lookup to determine the next hop for
          each of the destinations listed in the packet.

     2)   Partition the set of destinations based on their next hops.

     3)   Replicate the packet so that there's one copy of the packet
          for each of the next hops found in the previous steps.

     4)   Modify the list of destinations in each of the copies so that
          the list in the copy for a given next hop includes just the
          destinations that ought to be routed through that next hop.

     5)   Send the modified copies of the packet on to the next hops.

     6)   If the address of destination is equal to the address of the
          router, send the packet as a standard multicast packet to the
          receivers (X2M)

     So, in the example above, R3 will send one copy of packet to
     destination R5 with Xcast list of <R8 R9> and one copy of packet to
     destination R4 with Xcast list of <R4>. When R4 receives the
     packet, it will, by the X2M processing algorithm, send the packet
     as a standard multicast packet to the receivers <B and C>.

3. Control Plane in Xcast+

     This document describes a method using receiver initiated IGMP join
     to support dynamic member join and leave in Xcast+ scheme. In
     Xcast+, a standard multicast address is used to identify a
     multicast session. A sender creates and advertises a multicast
     session with standard multicast address. In order to identify
     Xcast+ session easily compared with ISM sessions, special multicast
     address range (e.g., similar with the SSM address range, 232/8) can
     be used. And thus, advertisement method using web pages will be
     useful. These allocations of Xcast+ multicast addresses and the
     advertisement method of Xcast+ multicast session are outside the
     scope of this document for further study.

     Figure 2 describes the whole control plane for Xcast+.

3.1. Receiver Considerations

     In Xcast+, receivers send IGMP join to their multicast router on
     the where they belong to a subnet in order to receive Xcast+
     packets, and then the join requests are sent through source-
     specific join to a sender. In order to achieve these works, it is
     necessary for receivers to know the address of the sender. Current
     version of IGMP, IGMPv3 can support source discovery and source-
     specific host membership report. In addition, IGMPv3 leave
     operation is also applicable to leave a multicast session




Myung-Ki Shin et al.      Expires August 2001                   [Page 6]


INTERNET-DRAFT Xcast+ Supporting Receiver Initiated Join   February 2001


     dynamically.  That is, Xcast+ receivers don't need to use
     additional control to join in Xcast+ session. A receiver that is an
     IGMPv3 capable host does not need to be an Xcast+ capable host. So,
     this requirement for receivers can be easily achieved.


3.2. Router Considerations

     In Xcast+, the router that receives the source-specific host report
     (S, G) sends source-specific join (S, G) like PIM-SSM to the
     sender. Unlike source-specific join of PIM-SSM, it is sent to the
     sender directly, so the intermediate routers don't need to keep the
     state information of the multicast session (S, G). In order to
     interoperate with non-PIM-SSM router, new mesaage carried within
     UDP packet can be defined instead of using source-specific join
     message of PIM-SSM, which contains information about S and G in the
     packet's payload.  In the case of IPv6, Destination extension
     header can be used for acheving this, without defining new message.
     This is outside the scope of this document for further study.

     The sender obtains the addresses of multicast routers that receive
     source-specific host report for multicast session (S, G) from the
     source-specific joins of Xcast+. Therefore, the intermediate
     routers on the delivery path don't need to be a PIM-SSM capable
     router to process and forward the source-specific join of Xcast+.

     Of course, Xcast+ scheme is extended from Xcast, so that all of
     router on the unicast path between senders and receivers MUST be an
     Xcast+ capable router to process and forward the Xcast+ packets.
     For gradual deployment, tunneling mechanism proposed in Xcast[1]
     can be used. This issue is the same as existing Xcast.



3.3. Sender Considerations

     In Xcast+, when a sender receives a source-specific join (S, G), it
     encodes Xcast+ headers including addresses of routers that send
     source-specific join (S, G). These router addresses are extracted
     from source addresses of the source-specific join (S, G) packets.
     Encoding method will be described in Chapter 4 in detail. Unlike
     receivers, a sender MUST be Xcast+ capable host.


4. Encoding for Xcast+

     When the sender receives join requests, the sender explicitly
     encodes the list of addresses of the multicast routers that receive
     source-specific host report in the Xcast+ data packets.

     In Xcast+, encoding methods for both IPv4 and IPv6 are the same as
     Xcast.

INTERNET-DRAFT Xcast+ Supporting Receiver Initiated Join   February 2001


     For IPv4, the source address field of the IPv4 header contains the
     address of the Xcast+ sender. The destination address field carries
     the standard multicast address in specified in Chapter 3, instead
     of All-Xcast-Routers address[1] which is designed for Xcast.

     The list of destinations will be encoded in a separate header. The
     Xcast+ header for IPv4 (in short Xcast+4) is carried between the
     IPv4 header and the transport layer header.


              [ IPv4 header | Xcast+4 | transport header | payload ]

     The Xcast+4 header is carried on top of an IP header. The IP header
     will carry the protocol number PROTO_Xcast+. The format of Xcast+
     header is equal to Xcast header[1]. Unlike Xcast, however, sender
     explicitly encodes the list of address of the multicast router that
     sends source-specific join message in Xcast+ header, instead of
     receiver address.

     For IPv6, the Xcast+6 header encoding is similar to IPv4, except
     that Xcast+ information is stored in IPv6 extension headers of
     'Routing Extension' header and 'Destination Extension' header. The
     IPv6 header MUST carry the NextHeader value 'Routing Extension'.
     The source address field contains the address of the Xcast+ sender.
     The destination address field carries the standard multicast
     address instead of All-Xcast-Routers address[1] which is designed
     for Xcast.


              [ IPv6 header | Xcast+6 | transport header | payload ]

     The method for encoding the destination address is the same as
     Xcast+ for IPv4.



5. Cost Analysis of ISM, SSM, Xcast and Xcast+

     Costs of ISM, SSM, Xcast and Xcast+ schemes can be summarized as
     described in Table 1. As a result of analysis, while Xcast+ has
     some control plane overheads compared to Xcast, its cost of extra
     packet processing can be saved when the number of receivers
     increases in a subnet. For example, while the cost of Xcast and
     Xcast+ will be equal, if there is one receiver in a subnet, the
     cost of Xcast+ will be reduced at n times theoretically than cost
     of Xcast, if there are n increases of number of receivers (assuming
     that overhead of control plane is ignored).


6. Applicability and Other Considerations

     Xcast+ can support a very large number of medium size multicast

     groups, while Xcast is suitable for a very large number of small
     multicast groups. Therefore, application areas are the same to
     Xcast, for example, conferencing, multi-player games, collaborative
     working, etc., in light of the number of members, however, Xcast+
     is more scalable than Xcast.

     Besides application, other considerations such as impact on upper
     layer protocols, gradual deployment, API, etc. are similar to
     Xcast[1].
