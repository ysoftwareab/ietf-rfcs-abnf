      Abstract 
         IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting 
         or videoconferencing raise the issue of making sure 
         that potential customers are fully entitled to access 
         the corresponding contents. There is indeed a need 
         for service and content providers to identify (if not 
         authenticate, especially within the context of 
         enforcing electronic payment schemes) and to invoice 
         such customers in a reliable and efficient manner. 
         This memo describes the framework for specifying the 
         Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA) 
         capabilities that could be activated within the 
         context of the deployment and the operation of IP 
         multicast-based services.  This framework addresses 
         the requirements presented in draft-ietf-mboned-
         maccnt-req-04.txt, "Requirements for Accounting, 
         Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed IP 
         Multicasting Services". The memo provides a basic AAA 
         enabled model as well as an extended fully enabled 
         model with resource and admission control 
         coordination.

1. Introduction 
    
1.1 Purpose and Background 
   IP multicasting is designed to serve cases of group 
   communication schemes of any kind, such as 1-to-n (case of 
   TV broadcasting services for example) or n-to-p (case of 
   videoconferencing services, for example).   
      In these environments, IP multicast provides a better 
   resource optimization than using a unicast transmission 
   scheme, where data need to be replicated as many times as 
   there are receivers. Activation of IP multicast 
   capabilities in networks yields the establishment and the 
   maintenance of multicast distribution trees that are 
   receiver-initiated by nature: multicast-formatted data are 
   forwarded to receivers who explicitly request them.  
    
        IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting 
   or videoconferencing raise the issue of making sure that 
   potential customers are fully entitled to access the 
   corresponding contents. 
   There is indeed a need for service and content providers to 
   identify (if not authenticate, especially within the 
   context of enforcing electronic payment schemes) and to 
   invoice such customers in a reliable and efficient manner.  
   Solutions should consider a wide range of possible content 
   delivery applications: content delivered over the multicast 
   network may include video, audio, images, games, software 
   and information such as financial data, etc. 
    
    
         This memo describes a framework for specifying the 
   Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA) 
   capabilities that could be activated within the context of 
   the deployment and the operation of IP multicast-based 
   services. This memo also describes a framework to realize 
   high-quality multicast transport using a Resource and 
   Admission Control System (RACS) with multicast 
   Authorization. 
   Specifically, this framework addresses the requirements 
   presented in draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-04.txt, 
   "Requirements for Accounting, Authentication and 
   Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting Services" 
   MACCNT-REQ-draft describes the requirements in CDN services 
   using IP multicast[1]. The requirements are derived from: 
        - need for user tracking and billing capabilities 
        - need for network access control to satisfy the 
   requirements of the Network Service Provider (NSP) and/or 
   content access control to satisfy the requirements of the 
   Content Provider (CP)

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting   July 2007 
    
    
        - methods for sharing information between the network 
   service provider and content provider to make it possible 
   to fulfill the above two requirements. 
    
   Detailed requirements are presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.   
   These requirements include mechanisms for recording end-
   user requests and provider responses for content-delivery, 
   sharing user information (possibly anonymously depending on 
   the trust model) between content provider and network 
   service provider, and protecting resources through the 
   prevention of network and content access by unauthorized 
   users, as well as other AAA related requirements. 
     
   The purpose of this memo is to provide a generalized framework
   for specifying multicast-inferred AAA capabilities that can 
   meet these requirements. This framework is to provide a 
   basis for future work of investigating the applicability of 
   existing AAA protocols to provide these AAA capabilities in 
   IP multicast specific context and/or if deemed necessary, 
   the refining or defining of protocols to provide these 
   capabilities.   
    
    
    
2. Definitions and Abbreviations 
    
2.1 Definitions 
    
   For the purpose of this memo the following definitions 
   apply: 
    
   Accounting: The set of capabilities that allow the 
   retrieval of a set of statistical data that can be defined 
   on a per customer and/or a per service basis, within the 
   context of the deployment of multicast-based services. Such 
   data are retrieved for billing purposes, and can be 
   retrieved on a regular basis or upon unsolicited requests. 
   Such data include (but are not necessarily limited to) the 
   volume of multicast-formatted data that have been forwarded 
   to the receiver over a given period of time, the volume of 
   multicast-formatted data that have been exchanged between a 
   receiver (or set of) and a given source over a given period 
   of time (e.g. the duration of a multicast session), etc.  
    
   Authentication: action for identifying a user as a genuine 
   one. 
 
   Authorization: The set of capabilities that need to be 
   activated to make sure a given requesting customer is (1)

   what he claims to be (identification purposes), and (2) is 
   fully entitled to access a set of services (authentication 
   purposes). 
    
   Receiver: an end-host or end-client which receives content.  
   A receiver may be identified by a network ID such as MAC 
   address or IP address.   
    
   User: a human with a user account.  A user may possibly use 
   multiple reception devices.  Multiple users may use the 
   same reception device. 
    
   Note: The definition of a receiver (device) and a user 
   (human) should not be confused.

3. Common use models and network architecture implications 
    
   In some cases a single entity may design and be responsible 
   for a system that covers the various common high-level 
   requirements of a multicasting system such as 1) content 
   serving, 2) the infrastructure to multicast it, 3) network 
   and content access control mechanisms. In many cases 
   however the content provision and network provision roles 
   are divided between separate entities.  The MACCNT-REQ-

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting   July 2007 
    
    
   draft provides more detail of the multiple versus single 
   entity CDS network models. 
 
   As such it should not be assumed that the entity 
   responsible for the multicasting structure and the entity 
   responsible for content serving are the same.  Indeed 
   because the infrastructure for multicasting is expensive 
   and many content holders are not likely to be competent at 
   building and maintaining complicated infrastructures 
   necessary for multicasting, many content holders would 
   prefer to purchase transport and management services from a 
   network service provider and thus share the infrastructure 
   costs with other content holders.   
    
   Similarly network service providers in many cases do not 
   specialize in providing content and are unlikely to build 
   and maintain such a resource-intensive system without a 
   certain level of demand from content holders.   
    
   The use model of a single NSP providing multicasting 
   services to multiple CPs the following general requirements 
   from MACCNT-REQ-draft apply: 
    
        -Need for user tracking and billing capabilities 
        -Need for QoS control such as resource management and 
   admission control 
        -Need for conditional content access control 
   satisfactory to the requirements of the CP 
        -Methods for sharing information between the NSP and 
   CP to make the above two possible 
         
     
   When the NSP and CP are the same single entity the general 
   requirements are as follows. 
    
        -Need for user tracking and user-billing capabilities 
        -Need for access control and/or content protection at 
   level the entity deems appropriate

                        Figure 1 
 
   For the sake of simplicity, the above diagram portrays a 
   case where there is a single NSP entity and a single CP 
   entity, but multiple CPs can be connected to the same NSP. 
   It is also possible for the same CP to be connected to 
   multiple NSP networks (e.g. network selection).  In other 
   words the relationship of NSP:CP can be described as  1:1, 
   1:N or M:N.  Furthermore it is possible that the NSP and CP 
   could be the same entity.   
 
   Description of Roles: 
    
   The user (or the user's device) selects a CP and a NSP when 
   the user requests content. The NSP may be automatically 
   selected by a user terminal: e.g. a fixed line NSP for STB 
   or a mobile NSP for mobile phone.  In some usage cases it 
   is possible that the NSP used by the user terminal will not 
   always be the same.  For example a user may have contracted 
   with different NSPs for fixed line or mobile roaming access.  
    
   The CP is responsible for Authentication and Authorization 
   of users' access to content that the CP manages. The CP 
   hopes to collect accounting information related to the 
   access of their content. The CP may choose to authenticate 
   and authorize NSPs which are eligible to provide users 
   access to its contents.  When the CP cannot (e.g. error or 
   resource issues) or decides not (e.g. policy issues) to 
   deliver content, the CP is responsible for notifying the 
   NSP of the reason.  It is up to the NSP how to relay or 
   translate the messages to the user. 
 
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Jacquenet, Hayashi, He                    [Page 7] 
    
   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting   July 2007 
    
    
   The NSP is responsible for managing its network resources.  
   The NSP may perform admission control. It is also 
   responsible for relaying the AAA messages from the CP 
   whether the user is eligible to receive content 
   (authentication by proxy), and the NSP's relevant AAA 
   server will allow access to the network and contents 
   conditional to both the CP AAA server's content 
   authorization result and the NSPs network utilization 
   authorization result.  In certain cases the CP and NSP may 
   have a contractual relationship in which the NSP is 
   authorized to make the content authorization decision based 
   on mutually predetermined criteria: in such cases the NSP-
   AAA may also make the content authorization decision 
   without querying the CP-AAA.  When the NSP cannot or 
   decides not to multicast to users, the NSP may notify the 
   users of the reason. It is recommended that the NSP notify 
   eligible users of the reason for not multicasting content 
   when it is due network or content unavailability, for 
   example.  The NSP may choose not to notify ineligible users 
   of the reason for any case. 
 
 
 
4.2 Multiple User IDs 
    
   Users may hold multiple user IDs: IDs which have been 
   separately assigned for each subscription they may have for 
   various NSPs and CPs.  The NSPs and CPs control the user 
   IDs for their respective domains.  The user IDs are only 
   meaningful in the context of each domain. 
    
   When the user wants to access content, the user registers 
   the corresponding user ID (including its CP domain 
   information) with a request for content, etc: web 
   authentication is one possible method. 
    
   Each CP may identify users by the user IDs that it has 
   issued to them. 
    
   Terminal portability can be realized if the NSP 
   authenticates a user using a NSP-assigned user ID. A NSP-
   assigned user ID is an access-line independent unique ID 
   assigned to users which allows user identification from any 
   access point within the network and possibly roaming to 
   other networks.  This allows the user to access the content 
   from various network access points. 
    
 
   The NSP and CP do not need to know the corresponding user 
   id for the same user in the other provider's domain, and it 
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Jacquenet, Hayashi, He                    [Page 8] 
    
   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting   July 2007 
    
    
   is not necessary that there is a one to one relationship.  
   It is quite possible for one person to hold multiple user 
   ids for the same provider. 
    
   The actual mapping rules for NSPs and CPs to map user IDs 
   with the IDs in other provider domains is a matter for the 
   providers.  A solution should provide an API between the 
   providers to flexibly support various mapping methods.   
    
4.3 Accounting 
    
   MACCNT-REQ-draft defines requirements for Accounting and 
   Billing. These include the requirement for the NSP to log 
   user behavior such as the join action and the leave action, 
   as well as the result of the access-control decision. 
   (MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.5) MACCNT-REQ-draft also specifies 
   that there should be a standardized way to sharing with the 
   CP the user behavior and content reception information 
   which the NSP is logging.(MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.5.1) 
   Standardization of the logs or messages to share content 
   usage information is important to support a single NSP 
   sharing accounting information with multiple CPs or a 
   single CP receiving from multiple NSPs. 
    
   In order to provide the granularity of user-behavior and 
   actual content reception information as specified in 
   MACCNT-REQ-draft, the NSP should not manage multicast 
   states on a subnet basis, but on a user basis (see in 
   MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.1 "User identification") because the 
   NSP needs to be able to notify the CP of a user's start and 
   stop times for accounting purposes. This means that the NSP 
   sends to the CP AAA an indication for Join and Leave on a 
   user basis. User-based multicast state management is 
   equivalent to explicit membership tracking in RFC3376 and 
   per-host tracking in RFC3810. 
    
   This framework specifies an accounting API provided by the 
   NSP and accessed by the CP to allow for sharing user-
   behavior and content-reception information between the NSP 
   AAA and CP AAA. This accounting API should be configurable 
   to allow the CP to request only the logging information it 
   actually requires.  Such an API would allow for realtime 
   accounting information sharing by the NSP to the CP. When 
   logging information is shared through the accounting API, 
   it is important that the CP be able to match the user as 
   described in the database operated by the NSP to the user 
   as described in the database operated by the CP. 
 
   The NSP requires the capability to log both user and host 
   information for each join and leave, indicating the

   Internet Draft     AAA Framework for Multicasting   July 2007 
    
    
   corresponding multicast source for each action. When either 
   a CP source stops sending, or the NSP stops multicasting, 
   in an unsolicited manner, there is also a need to notify 
   the AAA servers accordingly about the users who are 
   impacted by this event.  
    
   Also, intermittent logs between the join and leave would 
   allow for finer diagnostics and therefore could serve 
   useful in billing discrepancies, and provide for a better 
   estimation of the time span that content was multicasted in 
   the even that users disconnect without sending leave 
   messages.  
    
    
 
4.4 Access Control and CP selection by NSP 
    
   When a NSP receives an access request from a user, it is 
   necessary for the NSP to determine to which CP the request 
   is to be directed. It is necessary for the NSP to ensure 
   that it is not spoofed by an inappropriate CP or user. 
 
 
4.5 API for Admission Control Information by NSP 
 
   After authorizing a user request, the NSP may have further 
   conditions for determining its admission control decision. 
   MACCNT-REQ-draft defines requirements for providing the 
   network capability to conduct admission control based on 
   the network bandwidth usage status and bandwidth management 
   policy. (MACCNT-REQ-draft, 4.2.2, 4.2.3 & 4.9) Such QoS 
   measurement and policy mechanisms themselves are out of the 
   scope of this memo. However the NSP's AAA Server should be 
   provided with an Admission control API that allows for 
   interfacing so that additional conditions can be added to 
   the admission control decision.   
 
    
4.6 Access Control and Distinguishing of Users by CP 
    
   The user ID and authentication information are forwarded 
   transparently by the NSP so that the CP can distinguish the 
   user, as well as authenticate and authorize the request. 
    
4.7 Caching of AAA results 
    
   An NSP should be able to cache AAA results based upon an 
   agreement between the NSP and a CP.  The AAA cache would

   receive multicast data from specified channel(s) up to 
   specified expiration date(s) and time(s).   
   If such caching is implemented, a method must exist for the 
   CP to communicate this permission information to the NSP.  
   The NSP refers to the AAA cache and if the cache indicates 
   that the user has permission to receive multicast data from 
   a specific channel at that time, the NSP may forward the 
   data without querying the CP.   
    
   It should be possible for a CP to send unsolicited requests 
   to the NSP to refresh or change the permissions for a user 
   for specific channel(s).   
    
   When a user is receiving multicast content and the 
   permission is about to expire, the NSP may send a 
   notification to the user client that his session is about 
   to expire, and that he will need to re-connect. The user 
   will have to reestablish a connection.  In the case that 
   the user still has permission to the content, they should 
   be able to continue to receive the content without 
   interruption.  
    
    
5. Network Connection Model and Functional Components 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for 
   multicasting.  This section provides more detail on the 
   network connection model and constituent functional 
   components.  
 
5.1 Basic Connection Model 
    
    
   In the simple case represented in Figure 1 the NSP is the 
   sole entity providing network resources including network 
   access to the User.  First a user that requests content 
   sends an Access request to an NSP which then forwards it on 
   to the appropriate CP for Authentication and Authorization 
   purposes. The CP responds with either "success" or 
   "failure".  If "success", the NSP may forward a success 
   response and stream multicast data to the user. 
    
   In this model the user selects the NSP to which to send its 
   content request.  Based on this request the NSP selects an 
   appropriate CP to which it forwards the request. The CP 
   responds to the NSP's request:  it may not respond to 
   another NSP in regards to the request. 
    
   In this model, as described in section 3.1, the 
   relationship between NSP and CP can be 1:1, 1:N or M:N.

5.2 Constituent Logical Functional Components of the fully 
enabled AAA Framework 
    
    
   MACCNT-REQ-draft defined requirements for "well managed" 
   multicasting which this memo calls "AAA enabled" 
   multicasting. "Fully enabled AAA" multicasting in this memo 
   means "AAA enabled" with added QoS functions. 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for 
   multicasting.  Below is a diagram of a AAA enabled 
   multicasting network with AAA, including the logical 
   components within the various entities.

   The user entity includes the CPE (Customer Premise 
   Equipment) which includes the user host(s) and optionally a 
   multicast proxy (not shown in the Figure 2.)   
    
   The NSP (Network Service Provider) in the basic model 
   includes the transport system and a logical element for 
   multicast AAA functionality.  The transport system is 
   comprised of the access node and NAS (network access 
   server.)  Descriptions of AN and its interfaces are out of
   scope for this memo.  The multicast AAA function may be
   provided by a multicast AAA server (mAAA) which may include
   a function by which the access policy is downloaded to the
   NAS (conditional access policy control function.) The 
   interface between mAAA and NAS is labeled IFb in Figure 2. 
   Over IFb the NAS makes an access request to the NSP-mAAA
   and the mAAA replies. The mAAA may push conditional access
   policy to the NAS. 
    
   The content provider may have its own AAA server which has
   the authority over access policy for its contents. 
    
   The interface between the user and the NSP is labeled IFa 
   in Figure 2.  Over IFa the user makes a multicasting 
   request to the NSP.  The NSP may in reply send multicast 
   traffic depending on the NSP and CP's policy decisions. 
    
   The interface between the NSP and CP is labeled IFc. Over 
   IFc the NSP requests to the CP-AAA for access to contents 
   and the CP replies.  CP may also send conditional access 
   policy over this interface for AAA-caching.

   In the fully enabled model the NSP also includes a 
   component that provides network resource management (e.g. 
   QoS management), as described in section 3.4, "Network 
   Resource Management by NSP".  In the fully enabled model 
   (Figure 3) resource management and admission control is 
   provided by mRACF (multicast resource and admission control 
   function.)  This means that mRACF and Authorization portion
   of mAAA comprise RACS.  Before replying to the user's 
   multicast request the mAAA queries the mRACF for a network 
   resource access decision over the interface IFd.   The mRACF
   is responsible for allocating network resources for multicast
   traffic.  So that mRACF has the necessary network resource

   availability information, NAS notifies mRACF via mAAA of the 
   stopping of multicast traffic.

5.3 Modularity of the framework 
    
   In the interest of flexibility, this framework is modular 
   so that it is possible that partially enabled versions of 
   the models are supported.  A AAA-enabled version provides 
   AAA functionality without Network Resource management.  A 
   Network-Resource-Management-enabled (QoS-enabled) version 
   provides Network Resource management without AAA 
   functionality.  Similarly, the possibility of one or more 
   layers of transit provision between an NSP and CP is in the 
   interest of modularity and extendibility. 
    
    
6. IANA considerations 
    
   This memo does not raise any IANA consideration issues. 
    
    
7. Security considerations 
    
   Refer to section 3.3.  Also the user information related to 
   authentication with the CP must be protected in some way.  
   Otherwise, this memo does not raise any new security issues 
   which are not already addressed by the original protocols.  
   Enhancement of multicast access control capabilities should 
   enhance security performance. 
    
    
8. Conclusion 
    
   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution 
   standards to meet the requirements presented in MACCNT-REQ-
   draft.  Further work should be done to specify the 
   interfaces between the user and NSP, NAS and mAAA, mAAA and 
   mRACF and NSP-mAAA and CP-AAA (presented in 5.2.)
