Abstract

   This document defines extensions to iCalendar and iTIP that allow the
   expression of imprecise and multiple alternative events in calendar
   objects and scheduling messages.  Imprecise events can be used to
   imprecisely describe an event by specifying various ranked periods of
   time in which it could be scheduled.  Alternative events can be used
   to describe an event in terms of multiple ranked event descriptions,
   imprecise or not, that could alternatively be scheduled.

Internet-Draft      Imprecise and alternative events            May 2007


1.  Introduction

   Calendar users may want to express an event not by using a unique
   exact description, but in terms of several possible alternative event
   descriptions.  A possible event could, in turn, be described
   imprecisely, i.e., not with fixed start and end times, but in terms
   of one or more periods of time in which it could occur.
   Additionally, it should be possible to rank each of these alternative
   events and periods of time, so as to represent the suitability or
   likelihood of scheduling them in fact.

   These features would make possible the description of an event like
   the following: a 1 hour long business meeting taking place at office
   A on Monday between 8 am and 11 am - preferred -, or at office B on
   Thursday 2 pm or Friday after 4:30 pm.  Such flexible representation
   of an event allow users to communicate uncertainty and preferences
   that naturally occur [SL02].

   This is specially important during scheduling negotiation, when the
   "Attendees" have to agree about an event description.  Multiple
   alternative event descriptions and periods of time can help a group
   of "Attendees" to faster converge into a description that is
   acceptable for all [SD98].  In most situations, that means to reach
   consensus about an event time that satisfies a common feasible free
   time interval, but other event properties can be under negotiation as
   well (e.g., duration, location, summary).  In the worst case, if only
   the nth event proposal sent by the "Organizer" is acceptable by all
   "Attendees", offering one event description per proposal leads to n
   negotiation 'rounds'.  Conversely, in the best case, if the
   "Organizer" had proposed n alternative event descriptions, only one
   negotiation round would have been enough.

   However, iCalendar [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis] does not provide a
   way to describe an event imprecisely or to represent multiple event
   alternatives.  This cannot be done by using several iTIP
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] messages either.

   To accomplish these, this memo defines new types of iCalendar
   calendar components and specifies iTIP methods for their use in
   scheduling messages.

3.  iCalendar Extensions

   This specification adds the new "VIMPRECISEEVENT" and
   "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar components to iCalendar.  The
   "VIMPRECISEEVENT" component describes an imprecise event in terms of
   periods of time in which it could be scheduled.  These periods are
   expressed by "VFREEBUSY" and "VAVAILABILITY"
   [I-D.daboo-calendar-availability] components.  The
   "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" component describes alternative events by
   grouping multiple "VEVENT" and "VIMPRECISEEVENT" event descriptions.

   Whereas the "VIMPRECISEEVENT" and "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" components
   describe events, they are not intended to represented "regular"
   events that correspond to a scheduled amount of time, what is done by
   the "VEVENT" component.  Imprecise and alternative events components
   do not take up time on a calendar, since they just represent a
   schedulable amount of time whose description definition is in course.
   As such, these components MUST NOT be considered to generate results
   for an iTIP "VFREEBUSY" REQUEST, what includes CalDAV calendar-access
   [RFC4791] CALDAV:free-busy-query REPORT and CalDAV calendar-schedule
   [I-D.desruisseaux-caldav-sched] free-busy lookup.

   This specification also adds the new "RANK" property to the "VEVENT"
   and "VIMPRECISEEVENT" components, and to the "AVAILABLE" sub-
   components of the "VAVAILABILITY" component.  A new "RANK" property
   parameter is also defined for the "FREEBUSY" parameter of the
   "VFREEBUSY" component.  These extensions allow alternative events and
   periods of time used to describe imprecise events to be ranked.

3.1.  Imprecise Event Component

   Component Name:  VIMPRECISEEVENT

   Purpose:  Provide an imprecise event description.

   Format Definition:  A "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component is defined
      by the following notation:

                              ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                              ; but SHOULD NOT occur more than once

                              rrule /

                              ; the following are OPTIONAL,
                              ; and MAY occur more than once

                              attach / attendee / categories / comment /
                              contact / rstatus / related / resources /
                              x-prop / iana-prop

                              )

   Description:  A "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties, and possibly including "VFREEBUSY" and
      "VAVAILABILITY" components, that represents a schedulable amount
      of time, imprecisely described, for which exact start and end
      times are not specified.  As opposed to a "regular" event
      represented by a "VEVENT" component, a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" does not
      represent a scheduled amount of time on a calendar, but an
      imprecise event that, once having its temporal properties - start
      time and end time (or duration) - defined, can be represented by a
      "VEVENT" component.

      Included "VFREEBUSY" and "VAVAILABILITY" components represent
      available periods of time for effectively scheduling the event.
      The "VFREEBUSY" components MUST follow the same semantics used to
      publish busy time specified on [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis].

Internet-Draft      Imprecise and alternative events            May 2007


      Typically, the "FBTYPE" parameter of "FREEBUSY" properties present
      on these "VFREEBUSY" components will have the "FREE" value, but
      "BUSY-TENTATIVE" and "BUSY" values MAY also be used so as to
      denote that events scheduled on the interval represented by the
      "FREEBUSY" property could be rescheduled in favor of the imprecise
      event in question.  The "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE" value SHOULD NOT be
      used for this purpose.

      The resulting available time is the union of the periods of time
      represented by all "VFREEBUSY" and "VAVAILABILITY" components.
      Periods of time specified by the "VFREEBUSY" components MUST NOT
      overlap.  However, a period specified by a "VFREEBUSY" component
      MAY overlap those represented by "VAVAILABILITY" components.  In
      this case, the interval specified via "VFREEBUSY" overrides those
      defined by any "VAVAILABILITY" components.

      In the context of an imprecise event, a "RRULE" is not intended to
      specify a concrete recurrence set of events, but to express a
      frequency of occurrence that the actual scheduled event may have.
      Within a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" component the UNTIL rule part of a
      recurrence rule MUST NOT be specified.

   Example:  The following is an example of a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar
      component that describes a 2 hour long department meeting taking
      place whenever between 8:00 AM to 12:00 on April 1st, 2008:

        BEGIN:VIMPRECISEEVENT
        UID:20071005T133225Z-00001@example.com
        DTSTAMP:20071005T133225Z
        SUMMARY:Department meeting
        DURATION:PT2H

        END:VFREEBUSY
        END:VIMPRECISEEVENT

      The following is an example of a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar
      component that describes a medical check-up occurring within any
      of the periods of time specified by the "VFREEBUSY" components and
      that is intended to have a monthly recurrence:

      The following is an example of a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar
      component that describes a director election.  The "VAVAILABILITY"
      component specifies a 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM recurring availability on
      Tuesdays and Thursdays, from March 15th to April 15th.  The
      "VFREEBUSY" component also overrides the "VAVAILABILITY" component
      between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM on April 1st and specifies an
      additional free interval from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM on April 3rd.

      of component properties, including at least two event components,
      that represents a schedulable amount of time, described in terms
      of alternative event descriptions, for which exact property values
      are not specified.  As opposed to a "regular" event represented by
      a "VEVENT" component, a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" does not represent a
      scheduled amount of time on a calendar, but an event with multiple
      possible alternatives that, once having its properties defined,
      can be represented by a "VEVENT" component.

      If specified on a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" component, OPTIONAL
      properties SHOULD also have their values interpreted as the
      default values for the properties of each grouped event component.
      In this case, if also present on a grouped event component, an
      OPTIONAL property overrides its default value.

   Example:  The following is an example of a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS"
      calendar component used to represent an event that can take one of
      the descriptions represented by the "VEVENT" and "VIMPRECISEEVENT"
      components.  Note that the "COMMENT" property default value
      specified by the alternative events component is overridden within
      the imprecise event component.

3.3.  Rank Component Property

   Property Name:  RANK

   Purpose:  This property is used to convey the percent rank for
      regular and imprecise event components on the context of an
      alternative events, and for availability components on the context
      of an imprecise event.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in a "VEVENT" or
      "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component grouped by a
      "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component.  This property can be
      specified once in a "AVAILABLE" sub-component of a "VAVAILABILITY"
      component.

   Description:  The property value is a positive integer between zero
      and one hundred.  A value of "0" indicates the lowest possible
      rank.  A value of "100" indicates the highest possible rank.  The
      rank may express the preference or relative availability of the
      calendar user regarding the event description or available periods
      of time it refers to.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

           rank       = "RANK" rankparam ":" integer CRLF

           rankparam  = *(";" other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property to show a 40%
      rank.

           RANK:40

3.4.  Rank Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  RANK

   Purpose:  To convey a percent rank for the property value.

Internet-Draft      Imprecise and alternative events            May 2007


   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

           rankpparam  = "RANK" "=" integer

   Description:  The parameter value is a positive integer between zero
      and one hundred.  A value of "0" indicates the lowest possible
      rank.  A value of "100" indicates the highest possible rank.  This
      parameter can be used on the "FREEBUSY" property to indicate the
      rank of the period of time described by it.

   Example:  The following is an example of this parameter to represent
      a 40% rank for an interval specified by a "FREEBUSY" property.

           FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=FREE;RANK=40:20080401T160000Z/PT1H

   The following summarizes the methods that are defined for the
   "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component.

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | Method         | Description                                      |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | PUBLISH        | Post notification of an imprecise event.  Used   |
   |                | primarily as a method of advertising the         |
   |                | existence of an imprecise event.                 |
   |                |                                                  |
   | REQUEST        | Make a request for an imprecise event.  This is  |
   |                | an explicit invitation to one or more            |
   |                | "Attendees".  Event Requests are also used to    |
   |                | update or change an existing imprecise event.    |
   |                | Clients that cannot handle REQUEST may degrade   |
   |                | the event to view it as a PUBLISH.               |
   |                |                                                  |
   | REPLY          | Reply to an imprecise event request.  Clients    |
   |                | may set their status ("partstat") to ACCEPTED,   |
   |                | DECLINED, TENTATIVE, or DELEGATED.               |
   |                |                                                  |
   | CANCEL         | Cancel an existing imprecise event.              |
   |                |                                                  |
   | REFRESH        | A request is sent to an "Organizer" by an        |
   |                | "Attendee" asking for the latest version of an   |
   |                | imprecise event to be resent to the requester.   |
   |                |                                                  |
   | COUNTER        | Counter a REQUEST with an alternative proposal,  |
   |                | Sent by an "Attendee" to the "Organizer".        |
   |                |                                                  |
   | DECLINECOUNTER | Decline a counter proposal.  Sent to an          |
   |                | "Attendee" by the "Organizer".                   |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

4.1.1.  PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component is an
   unsolicited posting of an iCalendar object.  Any CU may add published
   components to their calendar.  The "Organizer" MUST be present in a
   published iCalendar component.  "Attendees" MUST NOT be present.  Its
   expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary imprecise event as
   an iCalendar object.  The "Organizer" may subsequently update (with
   another "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a
   previously published "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   TBD

4.1.2.  REQUEST

   The "REQUEST" method in a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component
   provides the following scheduling negotiation functions:

   o  Invite "Attendees" to an imprecise event
   o  Response to a REFRESH request
   o  Update the details of an existing imprecise event
   o  Update the status of "Attendees" of an existing imprecise event
   o  Reconfirm an existing imprecise event
   o  Forward a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" to another uninvited CU
   o  For an existing "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component, delegate
      the role of "Attendee" to another CU
   o  For an existing "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component, changing
      the role of "Organizer" to another CU

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | PUBLISH        | Post notification of an alternatives event.      |
   |                | Used primarily as a method of advertising the    |
   |                | existence of an alternatives event.              |
   |                |                                                  |
   | REQUEST        | Make a request for an alternatives event.  This  |
   |                | is an explicit invitation to one or more         |
   |                | "Attendees".  Event Requests are also used to    |
   |                | update or change an existing alternatives event. |
   |                | Clients that cannot handle REQUEST may degrade   |
   |                | the event to view it as a PUBLISH.               |
   |                |                                                  |
   | REPLY          | Reply to an alternatives event request.  Clients |
   |                | may set their status ("partstat") to ACCEPTED,   |
   |                | DECLINED, TENTATIVE, or DELEGATED.               |
   |                |                                                  |
   | CANCEL         | Cancel an existing alternatives event.           |
   |                |                                                  |
   | REFRESH        | A request is sent to an "Organizer" by an        |
   |                | "Attendee" asking for the latest version of an   |
   |                | alternatives event to be resent to the           |
   |                | requester.                                       |
   |                |                                                  |
   | COUNTER        | Counter a REQUEST with an alternative proposal,  |
   |                | Sent by an "Attendee" to the "Organizer".        |
   |                |                                                  |
   | DECLINECOUNTER | Decline a counter proposal.  Sent to an          |
   |                | "Attendee" by the "Organizer".                   |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

4.2.1.  PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component is
   an unsolicited posting of an iCalendar object.  Any CU may add
   published components to their calendar.  The "Organizer" MUST be
   present in a published iCalendar component.  "Attendees" MUST NOT be
   present.  Its expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary
   alternatives event as an iCalendar object.  The "Organizer" may
   subsequently update (with another "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a
   "CANCEL" method) a previously published "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar
   component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   TBD

4.2.2.  REQUEST

   The "REQUEST" method in a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component
   provides the following scheduling negotiation functions:

   o  Invite "Attendees" to an alternative events
   o  Response to a REFRESH request
   o  Update the details of an existing alternative events
   o  Update the status of "Attendees" of an existing alternative events
   o  Reconfirm an existing alternatives event
   o  Forward a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" to another uninvited CU
   o  For an existing "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component, delegate
      the role of "Attendee" to another CU
   o  For an existing "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component, changing
      the role of "Organizer" to another CU

   The "Organizer" originates the "REQUEST".  The recipients of the
   "REQUEST" method are the CUs invited to the event, the "Attendees".
   "Attendees" use the "REPLY" method to convey attendance status to the
   "Organizer".

   The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" properties are used to distinguish the
   various uses of the "REQUEST" method.  If the "UID" property value in
   the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the
   "REQUEST" is for a new "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component.  If
   the "UID" property value is found on the recipient's calendar, then
   the "REQUEST" is for an update, or a reconfirm of the
   "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   | Component/Property    | Presence | Comment                        |

Appendix A.  Design Considerations (to be removed by RFC Editor prior to
             publication)

   This section points out some protocol design issues concerning the
   described extensions.

   In particular, the need of new special "event" components to support
   imprecise and alternative events can be questioned.  They can
   represent an interoperability problem with current implementations,
   and may overload workflow scheduling requirements, making it too
   complex, as VIMPRECISEEVENT and VALTERNATIVEEVENTS are intended to be
   used interchangeably with VEVENT during scheduling negotiation (e.g.,
   a VALTERNATIVEEVENTS could be used to COUNTER a VEVENT proposal, and
   vice versa).

   A simpler solution for this would consist on trying to extend the
   existing VEVENT component and method types to support imprecise and
   alternative descriptions.  That is the standardization direction that
   should be pursued, if possible.  Design choices that could be made to
   do so are presented here.

A.1.  Avoiding VALTERNATIVEEVENTS

   An extension of VEVENT to support an alternative events description
   could be the following:

   o  Use the RELATED-TO property to link multiple event components with
      each their own alternatives

   o  Create a new property to denote that these components should be
      interpreted as alternative descriptions

   Pros: an excellent fallback for existing CUAs.  Cons: instance-
   specific information for a recurring description would not be
   possible, as long as only one UID is used for all VEVENT components
   (should multiple UIDs be considered?).

A.2.  Avoiding VIMPRECISEEVENT

   An extension of VEVENT to support an imprecise event description
   could be the following:

   o  Create a new property to denote that the event should be
      interpreted as an imprecise description
   o  Desconsider the DTSTART and DTEND properties (dropping them does
      not seem possible, as they are always expected)
   o  Use TRANSP:TRANSPARENT to ensure that the event will not take up
      space on a calendar for current implementations

   There would be at least two options to use VFREEBUSY and
   VAVAILABILITY components to express the schedulable periods of time
   for the imprecise event:

   o  Allow a VEVENT component to contain these components (althought
      reasons for not doing this may exist... which?)
   o  Use 0+ VFREEBUSY and VAVAILABILITY components in a VEVENT iTIP
      message.  Cons: if two or more imprecise descriptions are used as
      alternative events, the available periods of time would refer to
      all descriptions, not to a specific one, also due to the single
      UID constraint (that can be a problem if the availability depends
      on properties of the event description - e.g., location).
