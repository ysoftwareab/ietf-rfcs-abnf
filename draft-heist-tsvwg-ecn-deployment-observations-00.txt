1.  Introduction

   To help guide the evolution of ECN, there is a need for more data on
   current deployment status, and observed usage of the ECN related
   bits, including:

   *  the initiation and acceptance of ECN capable TCP flows

   *  marking via CE, and feedback for TCP via the ECE and CWR flags

   *  codepoints set on packets for protocols other than TCP

   For several weeks, we gathered data on all traffic through an
   Internet Service Provider's gateway.  Though some of the results are
   informative, we caution that a larger, more widely reviewed and
   geographically distributed survey would be needed to be
   authoritative.

2.  Collection Details

   From December 28, 2020 to January 20, 2021, data was gathered on all
   traffic into and out of the Internet gateway at FreeNet Liberec, a
   cooperative WISP in an urban area of the Czech Republic.  A total of
   122.5 TB of incoming data and 12 TB of outgoing data was seen.

   Around 660 members belong to the ISP, and 861 member IP addresses on
   the LAN were considered active during data collection.  Most member
   IPs are used by a household of users, while others are for individual
   devices and public locations.

   [IPTABLES-ECN] was used to collect and analyze the data.  This
   consists of a script to gather the data using iptables and ipsets in
   Linux, and an analysis program that produces textual output.  An
   abbreviated version of the output is included in Section 5.  See the
   referred to source repository for more details and full output.

3.  Observations

   Our key observations are summarized as follows, and further expanded
   upon in the following sections:

   *  1.44% of TCP flows initiated ECN, across 45% of member IPs.

   *  The acceptance rate for ECN flows was likely >50%.

   *  24% of member IPs that negotiated TCP ECN flows saw apparent AQM
      marking via CE or ECE, with more congestion observed on the
      downstream.

   *  42% of the member IPs that saw CE or ECE were from subnets that
      have known AQM instances in the ISP's backhaul, and the remainder
      appear to be from unknown AQMs.

   *  Nonzero ECN codepoints were observed on 0.053% of non-TCP packets,
      with possible attribution to tunneled ECN and/or misuse of the ECN
      field.

3.1.  ECN Endpoint Activity

3.1.1.  Client Initiation

   Of 319.5 million TCP SYNs from LAN to WAN, 1.44% indicated ECN
   capability.  Of 861 active member IP addresses, 390 (45.3%) attempted
   initiation for at least one ECN flow.  A large proportion of the ECN
   flows are thought to come from Apple devices.

3.1.2.  Server Acceptance

   While 4.6 million ECN TCP SYNs were seen from LAN to WAN, 3.3 million
   ECN SYN-ACKs were seen in return.  While it's not possible to get an
   exact ECN acceptance rate from this, it appears to be reasonably
   high, likely due to default acceptance on prevailing server operating
   systems like Linux, FreeBSD and recent versions of Windows Server.

3.2.  RFC3168 AQM Activity

   There appears to be evidence of [RFC3168] marking AQMs.  Of 861
   active member IP addresses:

   *  382 member IPs, or 44%, successfully negotiated any TCP ECN flows

   *  90 member IPs, or 24% of those that negotiated ECN, saw any CE or
      ECE marks on negotiated TCP ECN flows

   Two backhaul links have fq_codel [RFC8290] deployed, serving the
   10.45.64.0/24 and 10.45.235.0/24 subnets.  This accounts for 38 of
   the 90 member IP addresses that saw CE or ECE, with the source of the
   remaining CE and ECE marks unknown.  These are presumed to be from
   other [RFC3168] marking AQM instances.

   Note that depending on the position of the marking AQM relative to
   the gateway, CE marks may not be seen on some packets, while TCP ECE
   flags are seen in the opposite direction.  For a number of member IP
   addresses, we saw 0 CE marks downstream, but ECE flags set upstream,
   suggesting an AQM downstream from the gateway marking downstream
   traffic.

3.3.  ECN Codepoints on Non-TCP Protocols

   Referring to the packet counts in the _All IP_ / _Both Directions_
   table in the stats output in Section 5, where M indicates megapackets
   and G, gigapackets:

   Other)

   We note the following:

   *  TCP accounted for 97.7% of the 536 million ECT(0) marks

   *  0.68% of all TCP packets were marked with a nonzero ECN codepoint

   *  0.053% of all non-TCP packets were marked with a nonzero ECN
      codepoint

   *  Non-TCP accounted for 99.8% of the 4.2 million CE marks

   *  Non-TCP accounted for virtually all of the ECT(1) marks

   Possible explanations for ECN marks on non-TCP packets are explored
   further in this section.

3.3.1.  Tunneled Traffic

   There are several different encapsulation methods used when handling
   the ECN field through tunnels, as per [RFC3168] and [RFC6040]:

   1.  copy the ECN field from the inner to the outer packet

   2.  reset the ECN field on the outer packet to ECT(0)

   3.  set Not-ECT on the outer packet

   When method 3 is used at both ends of a tunnel, we would not expect
   to see ECN codepoint usage in either direction.





Heist                    Expires 22 August 2021                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   ecndep                    February 2021


   When methods 1 or 2 are used at both ends of a tunnel, we would
   expect to see ECT(0) on both incoming and outgoing packets.  We would
   also expect a bias towards incoming packets, since more data is
   generally downloaded than uploaded, and pure ACKs do not have ECT(0)
   marks.

   When method 3 is used at only one end of the tunnel, we would expect
   to see ECT(0) on packets in only one direction.

   We note the following:

   *  Bi-directional ECT(0) marks were observed for two member IP / port
      pairs, on UDP port 443 and 60001.

   *  Uni-directional ECT(0) marks were observed for:

      -  UDP port 4500 (IPSec NAT traversal [RFC3948]) with 23 member IP
         addresses downstream, and 1 member IP address upstream.

      -  UDP port 51820 [WIREGUARD] with 2 member IP addresses
         downstream.

      -  Numerous UDP ports in other ranges, mostly on the downstream.

   While it's possible that some of the data observed was from tunneled
   ECN traffic, this can't be established definitively.

3.3.2.  Use of the ECN Field for Historical Reasons

   Some applications may still use historical definitions of the former
   TOS byte.  Although RFC791 reserved the ECN field for future use, the
   now obsolete [RFC1349] defined the TOS field as four bits within the
   Type of Service octet, one of which overlaps with the ECN field.
   This may account for some of the observed usage of ECT(0), since the
   value for "minimize monetary cost" was 0001, shifted to the left one
   bit, coinciding with ECT(0).

3.3.3.  Use of the ECN Field Inadvertently

   Users of operating system's socket APIs wishing to set a DiffServ
   codepoint may be confused as to whether or not they need to shift the
   desired value left two bits before passing it in.  Additionally, OS
   header files have been seen with out-of-date definitions for obsolete
   values in the former Type of Service octet, and obsolete definitions
   from [RFC2481].

Internet-Draft                   ecndep                    February 2021


   Another possible source of confusion is the TOS field values listed
   in the now obsolete [RFC1349], without having been shifted.  A casual
   reader could see the value 0001 for "minimize monetary cost" and
   think that they should use this value in the TOS byte, conflicting
   with ECT(1), not realizing that:

   *  [RFC1349] is obsolete

   *  even if it weren't obsolete, the TOS values must be shifted to the
      left *by one bit*

   To reduce incorrect usages of the DS field, OS header files should be
   sanitized, obsolete RFCs more prominently marked as such, and API
   documentation brought up to date.

3.3.4.  Use of the ECN Field Maliciously

   It's possible that some software is using the ECN field to gain an
   advantage in Internet queues or for some other nefarious purpose.
   Further analysis would be needed to determine if this is the case.

4.  Study Limitations and Recommendations for Future Work

4.1.  ECN Acceptance Rate

   While we captured the ratio of ECN SYNs to ECN SYN-ACKs, we do not
   have an exact count of flows that were accepted or rejected.  It may
   be possible to do this more accurately with additional iptables rules
   in [IPTABLES-ECN].

4.2.  Tunnels

   Tunnel protocols are challenging because of the different
   encapsulation methods and protocols used.  An analysis at the flow
   level, rather than by IP address and destination port pairs, might be
   more useful in identifying the usage of ECN over tunnels.

4.3.  Non-TCP Protocols

   More research is needed into the reasons for ECN codepoints being set
   on non-TCP traffic.  Given the relatively low volume of this traffic,
   it might be practical to take packet captures of it for further
   analysis.

   Additionally, we are currently not able to differentiate between the
   total number of packets for conntrack-supported and Other protocols.
   This could be improved with some changes to [IPTABLES-ECN].

4.4.  Other Protocols

   While this study looked at signals by IP address for TCP and IP/port
   for conntrack-supported protocols, it does not break down signals for
   Other protocols by IP address.  Among those protocols is IPSec ESP
   packets, using IP protocol 50.  The [IPTABLES-ECN] script could be
   modified to create more ipsets of type hash:ip, parallel to what was
   done for IP traffic as a whole, to further analyze these protocols
   for tunnel activity.

4.5.  NS Flag

   Since [RFC8311] declared that the NS (Nonce Sum) flag is again
   Reserved, after its now historical use by [RFC3540], we could collect
   any observed usages of this flag, to confirm that it's available for
   use in practice.

5.  Abbreviated Output from ecn-stats

   This abbreviated output only includes LAN to WAN flows, and a small
   subset of the non-TCP conntrack protocols by member IP address.  For
   full output, see the [IPTABLES-ECN] repository.

   *Note* the IP addresses shown here have been anonymized within the
   10.0.0.0/8 address space, in a way that retains the subnet structure.
