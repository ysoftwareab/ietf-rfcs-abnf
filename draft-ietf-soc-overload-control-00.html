<h1><br />Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Overload Control<br />DOCNAME</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
    SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages
    they receive. Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited
    overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable)
    response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload. This
    document defines an overload control mechanism for SIP.

Introduction</h3>

<p>As with any network element, a Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> server can suffer from overload
    when the number of SIP messages it receives exceeds the number of
    messages it can process. Overload can pose a serious problem for a
    network of SIP servers. During periods of overload, the throughput
    of a network of SIP servers can be significantly degraded. In
    fact, overload may lead to a situation in which the throughput
    drops down to a small fraction of the original processing
    capacity. This is often called congestion collapse.
</p>
<p>Overload is said to occur if a SIP server does not have
    sufficient resources to process all incoming SIP messages. These
    resources may include CPU processing capacity, memory,
    network bandwidth, input/output, or disk resources.
</p>
<p>For overload control, we only consider failure cases where SIP
    servers are unable to process all SIP requests due to resource
    constraints. There are other cases where a SIP server can
    successfully process incoming requests but has to reject them due
    to failure conditions unrelated to the SIP server being overloaded. 
    For example, a PSTN gateway that runs out of trunk lines but 
    still has plenty of capacity to process SIP messages should 
    reject incoming INVITEs using a 488 (Not
    Acceptable Here) response <a class='info' href='#RFC4412'>[RFC4412]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Similarly, a
    SIP registrar that has lost connectivity to its registration
    database but is still capable of processing SIP requests should
    reject REGISTER requests with a 500 (Server Error) response <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. Overload control does not apply to these
    cases and SIP provides appropriate response codes for them.
</p>
<p>The SIP protocol provides a limited mechanism for overload
    control through its 503 (Service Unavailable) response
    code. However, this mechanism cannot prevent overload of a SIP
    server and it cannot prevent congestion collapse. In fact, the use
    of the 503 (Service Unavailable) response code may cause traffic
    to oscillate and to shift between SIP servers and thereby worsen
    an overload condition. A detailed discussion of the SIP overload
    problem, the problems with the 503 (Service Unavailable) response
    code and the requirements for a SIP overload control mechanism can
    be found in <a class='info' href='#RFC5390'>[RFC5390]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Requirements for Management of Overload in the Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Overview of operations</h3>

<p>We now explain the overview of how the overload control
   mechanism operates by introducing the overload control parameters.
   <a class='info' href='#sec:header'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Via Header Parameters for Overload Control</span><span>)</span></a> provides more details and
   normative behavior on the parameters listed below.
</p>
<p>Because overload control is best performed hop-by-hop, the 
   Via parameter is attractive since it allows two adjacent SIP 
   entities to indicate support for, and exchange information associated 
   with overload control.  Additional advantages of this choice are
   discussed in <a class='info' href='#sec:dc:sm:response'>Section&nbsp;7.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>SIP Response Header</span><span>)</span></a>.  An alternative
   mechanism using SIP event packages was also considered, and the
   characteristics of that choice are further outlined in <a class='info' href='#sec:dc:sm:event'>Section&nbsp;7.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>SIP Event Package</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document defines three new parameters for the SIP Via header 
   for overload control.  These parameters provide a SIP mechanism for 
   conveying overload control information between adjacent SIP  
   entities.)  These parameters are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>oc: This parameter serves a dual purpose; when inserted by a
     SIP entity in a request going downstream, the parameter indicates
     that the SIP entity supports overload control.  When the downstream
     SIP server sends a response, the downstream SIP server will add a
     value to the parameter that indicates a loss rate (in percentage)
     by which the requests arriving at the downstream SIP server should
     be reduced. (c.f. <a class='info' href='#oc-create'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Creating the Overload Control Parameters</span><span>)</span></a>, 
     <a class='info' href='#oc-determine'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Determining the 'oc' Parameter Value</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#oc-process'>Section&nbsp;4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Processing the Overload Control Parameters</span><span>)</span></a> and 
     <a class='info' href='#oc-use'>Section&nbsp;4.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Using the Overload Control Parameter Values</span><span>)</span></a>.)
</li>
<li>oc-validity: Inserted by the SIP entity sending a response
     upstream.  This parameter contains a value that indicates the time 
     (in ms) that the load reduction specified by the "oc" parameter should 
     be in effect (c.f. <a class='info' href='#oc-create'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Creating the Overload Control Parameters</span><span>)</span></a>.)
</li>
<li>oc-seq: Inserted by the SIP entity sending a response upstream.
     This parameter contains a value that indicates the sequence number 
     associated with the "oc" parameter defined above (c.f. Section 
     <a class='info' href='#oc-create'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Creating the Overload Control Parameters</span><span>)</span></a>).
</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider a SIP entity, P1, which is sending requests to another
    downstream SIP server, P2.  The following snippets of SIP messages
    demonstrate how the overload control parameters work.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
       INVITE sips:user@example.com SIP/2.0
       Via: SIP/2.0/TLS p1.example.net;
         branch=z9hG4bK2d4790.1;received=192.0.2.111;oc
       ...

       SIP/2.0 100 Trying
       Via: SIP/2.0/TLS p1.example.net;
         branch=z9hG4bK2d4790.1;received=192.0.2.111;
         oc=20;oc-validity=500;oc-seq=1282321615.781
       ...
</pre></div>
<p>In the messages above, the first line is sent by P1 to P2.
    This line is a SIP request; because P1 supports overload control,
    it inserts the "oc" parameter in the topmost Via header that it 
    created.
</p>
<p>The second line --- a SIP response --- shows the topmost Via 
    header amended by P2 according to this specification and sent to
    P1.  Because P2 also supports overload control, it sends back further 
    overload control parameters towards P1 requesting that P1 reduce the 
    incoming traffic by 20% for 500ms.  P2 updates the "oc" parameter to
    add a value and inserts the remaining two parameters, "oc-validity"
    and "oc-seq".

The 'oc' Parameter</h3>

<p>A SIP entity that supports this specification MUST add
      an "oc" parameter to the Via headers it inserts into SIP
      requests. This provides an indication to downstream neighbors
      that this server supports overload control.  When inserted into
      a request by a SIP entity to indicate support for overload 
      control, there MUST NOT be a value associated with the

Creating the Overload Control Parameters</h3>

<p>A SIP server can provide overload control feedback to its
      upstream neighbors by providing a value for the "oc" parameter 
      to the topmost Via header field of a SIP response.  The topmost 
      Via header is determined after the SIP server has removed its 
      own Via header; i.e., it is the Via header that was generated 
      by the upstream neighbor.
</p>
<p>Since the topmost Via header of a response will be removed by
      an upstream neighbor after processing it, overload control
      feedback contained in the "oc" parameter will not travel beyond
      the upstream SIP entity. A Via header parameter therefore provides
      hop-by-hop semantics for overload control feedback (see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-soc-overload-design'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;soc&#8209;overload&#8209;design]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hilt, V., Noel, E., Shen, C., and A. Abdelal, &ldquo;Design Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>) even if the 
      next hop neighbor does not support this specification.
</p>
<p>The "oc: parameter can be used in all response types,
      including provisional, success and failure responses. A SIP
      server MAY update the "oc" parameter to all responses it
      is sending. A SIP server MUST update the "oc" parameter to responses
      when the transmission of overload control feedback is required
      by the overload control algorithm to limit the traffic received
      by the server. I.e., a SIP server MUST update the "oc" parameter
      when the overload control algorithm sets the value of an "oc" 
      parameter to a value different than the default value.
</p>
<p>A SIP server that has updated the "oc" parameter to Via header
      SHOULD also add a "oc_validity" parameter to the same Via
      header. The "oc_validity" parameter defines the time in
      milliseconds during which the content (i.e., the overload
      control feedback) of the "oc" parameter is valid. The default
      value of the "oc_validity" parameter is 500 (millisecond). A SIP 
      server SHOULD use a shorter "oc_validity" time if its overload 
      status varies quickly and MAY use a longer "oc_validity" time 
      if this status is more stable. If the "oc_validity" parameter is 
      not present, its default value is used. The "oc_validity" parameter 
      MUST NOT be used in a Via header that did not originally contain 
      an "oc" parameter when received.  Furthermore, when a SIP server
      receives a request with the topmost Via header containing only 
      an "oc-validity" parameter without the accompanying "oc" parameter. it
      MUST ignore the "oc-validity" parameter.
</p>
<p>When a SIP server retransmits a response, it SHOULD
      use the "oc" parameter value and "oc-validity" parameter 
      value consistent with the overload state at the time the
      retransmitted response is sent.  This implies that the
      values in the "oc" and "oc-validity" parameters may be
      different then the ones used in previous retransmissions
      of the response.  Due to the fact that responses sent over
      UDP may be subject to delays in the network and arrive
      out of order, the "oc-seq" parameter aids in detecting a
      stale "oc" parameter value.
</p>
<p>Implementations that are capable of updating the "oc"
      and "oc-validity" parameter values for retransmissions MUST
      insert the "oc-seq" parameter.  The value of this parameter
      MUST be a set of numbers drawn from an increasing sequence.
</p>
<p>Implementations that are not capable of updating the "oc"
      and "oc-validity" parameter values for retransmissions --- or
      implementations that do not want to do so because they will
      have to regenerate the message to be retransmitted --- MUST 
      still insert a "oc-seq" parameter in the first response
      associated with a transaction; however, they do not have to 
      update the value in subsequent retransmissions.
</p>
<p>The "oc_validity" and "oc-seq" Via header
      parameters are only defined in SIP responses and MUST NOT be 
      used in SIP requests. These parameters are only useful to the 
      upstream neighbor of a SIP server (i.e., the entity that is 
      sending requests to the SIP server) since this is the entity 
      that can offload traffic by redirecting/rejecting new requests. 
      If requests are forwarded in both directions between two SIP
      servers (i.e., the roles of upstream/downstream neighbors
      change), there are also responses flowing in both
      directions. Thus, both SIP servers can exchange overload
      information.
</p>
<p>Since overload control protects a SIP server from overload, 
      it is RECOMMENDED that a SIP server use the mechanisms described
      in this specification.  However, if a SIP server wanted to limit its 
      overload control capability for privacy reasons, it MAY decide to 
      perform overload control only for requests that are received 
      on a secure transport channel, such as TLS.  This enables a SIP
      server to protect overload control information and ensure that
      it is only visible to trusted parties.

Determining the 'oc' Parameter Value</h3>

<p>The value of the "oc" parameter is determined by an overload
      control algorithm (see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-soc-overload-design'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;soc&#8209;overload&#8209;design]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hilt, V., Noel, E., Shen, C., and A. Abdelal, &ldquo;Design Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>). This 
      specification does not mandate the use of a specific overload
      control algorithm. However, the output of an overload control
      algorithm MUST be compliant to the semantics of this Via header
      parameter.
</p>
<p>The "oc" parameter value specifies the percentage by which
      the load forwarded to this SIP server should be
      reduced. Possible values range from 0 (the traffic forwarded is 
      reduced by 0%, i.e., all traffic is forwarded) to 100 (the 
      traffic forwarded is reduced by 100%, i.e., no traffic
      forwarded). The default value of this parameter is 0.
</p>

<blockquote class="text">

</p>
<p>While it would in theory be possible to allow multiple

Processing the Overload Control Parameters</h3>

<p>A SIP entity compliant to this specification SHOULD remove
      "oc", "oc_validity" and "oc-seq" parameters from all Via headers of a
      response received, except for the topmost Via header. This
      prevents overload control parameters that were accidentally or
      maliciously inserted into Via headers by a downstream SIP server
      from traveling upstream.

      along with the address and port number of the SIP servers from 
      which they were received for the duration specified in the 
      "oc_validity" parameter or the default duration. Each time a 
      SIP entity receives a response with an "oc" parameter from a 
      downstream SIP server, it overwrites the "oc" value it has 
      currently stored for this server with the new value received. 
      The SIP entity restarts the validity period of an "oc" parameter 
      each time a response with an "oc" parameter is received from 
      this server. A stored "oc" parameter value MUST be discarded once 
      it has reached the end of its validity.

Using the Overload Control Parameter Values</h3>

<p>A SIP entity compliant to this specification MUST honor 
      overload control values it receives from downstream neighbors. The 
      SIP entity MUST NOT forward more requests to a SIP server than
      allowed by the current "oc" parameter value from a particular
      downstream server.
</p>
<p>When forwarding a SIP request, a SIP entity uses the SIP
      procedures of <a class='info' href='#RFC3263'>[RFC3263]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> to determine the next 
      hop SIP server.  The procedures of <a class='info' href='#RFC3263'>[RFC3263]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP Servers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> take 
      as input a SIP URI, extract the
      domain portion of that URI for use as a lookup key, and query
      the Domain Name Service (DNS) to obtain an ordered set of one
      or more IP addresses with a port number and transport corresponding
      to each IP address in this set (the "Expected Output").
</p>
<p>After selecting a specific SIP server from the Expected Output,
      the SIP entity MUST determine if it already has overload control
      parameter values for the server chosen from the Expected Output.
      If the SIP entity has a non-expired "oc" parameter value for
      the server chosen from the Expected Output, and this chosen server
      is operating in overload control mode.  Thus, the SIP entity MUST
      determine if it can or cannot forward the current request to the
      SIP server depending on the nature of the request and the
      prevailing overload conditions.
</p>
<p>The particular algorithm used to determine whether or not to
      forward a particular SIP request is a matter of local policy,
      and may take into account a variety of prioritization factors.  
      However, this local policy SHOULD generate the same number and 
      rate of SIP requests as the default algorithm (to be determined), 
      which treats all requests as equal.
</p>
<p>In the absence of a different local policy, the SIP entity
      SHOULD use the following default algorithm to determine
      if it can forward the request downstream (TODO: Need to devise an
      algorithm.  The original simple algorithm based on random number
      generation does not suffice for all cases.)

      SIP server that only relays messages between exactly two SIP
      servers may forward an "oc" parameter. The "oc" parameter is
      forwarded by copying it from the Via in which it was received
      into the next Via header (i.e., the Via header that will be on
      top after processing the response). If an "oc_validity"
      parameter is present, MUST be copied along with the "oc"
      parameter.

Message prioritization at the hop before the
     overloaded server</h3>

<p>During an overload condition, a SIP entity needs to
      prioritize requests and select those requests that need to be rejected
      or redirected. While this selection is largely a matter of local
      policy, certain heuristics can be suggested.  One, during overload
      control, the SIP entity should preserve existing dialogs as much
      as possible.  This suggests that mid-dialog requests MAY be
      given preferential treatment.  Similarly, requests that result in
      releasing resources (such as a BYE) MAY also be given 
      preferential treatment.
</p>
<p>A SIP entity SHOULD honor the local policy for prioritizing
      SIP requests such as policies based on the content of the
      Resource-Priority header (RPH, <a class='info' href='#RFC4412'>RFC4412<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4412]).
      Specific (namespace.value) RPH contents may indicate high priority
      requests that should be preserved as much as possible during
      overload.  The RPH contents can also indicate a low-priority
      request that is eligible to be dropped during times of overload.
      Other indicators, such as the SOS URN <a class='info' href='#RFC5031'>[RFC5031]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>
      indicating an emergency request, may also be used for 
      prioritization.
</p>
<p>Local policy could also include giving precedence to mid-
      dialog SIP requests (re-INVITEs, UPDATEs, BYEs etc.) in times
      of overload.  A local policy can be expected to combine both
      the SIP request type and the prioritization markings, and SHOULD
      be honored when overload conditions prevail.

Rejecting requests at an overloaded server</h3>

<p>If the upstream SIP entity to the overloaded server does
      not support overload control, it will continue to direct
      requests to the overloaded server.  Thus, the overloaded
      server must bear the cost of rejecting some session requests as 
      well as the cost of processing other requests to completion.  It 
      would be fair to devote the same amount of processing at the 
      overloaded server to the combination of rejection and processing 
      as the overloaded server would devote to processing requests 
      from an upstream SIP entity that supported overload control.
      This is to ensure that SIP servers that do not support this
      specification don't receive an unfair advantage over those that
      do. 
</p>
<p>A SIP server that is under overload and has started to
      throttle incoming traffic MUST reject this request with a
      "503 (Service Unavailable)" response without Retry-After header 
      to reject a fraction of requests from upstream neighbors that do
      not support overload control.

SIP Response Header</h3>

<p>Overload control information can be transmitted using a new
        Via header field parameter for overload control. A SIP server
        can add this header parameter to the responses it is sending
        upstream to provide overload control feedback to its upstream
        neighbors. This approach has the following
        characteristics:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A Via header parameter is light-weight and creates very 
          little overhead. It does not require the transmission of
          additional messages for overload control and does not
          increase traffic or processing burdens in an overload
          situation. 
</li>
<li>Overload control status can frequently be reported to
          upstream neighbors since it is a part of a SIP
          response. This enables the use of this mechanism in
          scenarios where the overload status needs to be adjusted
          frequently. It also enables the use of overload control
          mechanisms that use regular feedback such as window-based
          overload control.
</li>
<li>With a Via header parameter, overload control status is
	  inherent in SIP signaling and is automatically conveyed to
	  all relevant upstream neighbors, i.e., neighbors that are
	  currently contributing traffic. There is no need for a SIP
	  server to specifically track and manage the set of current
	  upstream or downstream neighbors with which it should
	  exchange overload feedback.
</li>
<li>Overload status is not conveyed to inactive senders. This
          avoids the transmission of overload feedback to inactive 
          senders, which do not contribute traffic. If an inactive
          sender starts to transmit while the receiver is in overload
          it will receive overload feedback in the first response and
          can adjust the amount of traffic forwarded accordingly. 
</li>
<li>A SIP server can limit the distribution of overload
	  control information by only inserting it into responses to
	  known upstream neighbors. A SIP server can use transport
	  level authentication (e.g., via TLS) with its upstream
	  neighbors.

SIP Event Package</h3>

<p>Overload control information can also be conveyed from a
        receiver to a sender using a new event package. Such an event
        package enables a sending entity to subscribe to the overload 
        status of its downstream neighbors and receive notifications
        of overload control status changes in NOTIFY requests. This 
        approach has the following characteristics:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Overload control information is conveyed decoupled from
          SIP signaling. It enables an overload control manager, which
          is a separate entity, to monitor the load on other servers
          and provide overload control feedback to all SIP servers
          that have set up subscriptions with the controller.
</li>
<li>With an event package, a receiver can send updates to
          senders that are currently inactive. Inactive senders will 
          receive a notification about the overload and can refrain
          from sending traffic to this neighbor until the overload
          condition is resolved. The receiver can also notify all
          potential senders once they are permitted to send traffic 
          again. However, these notifications do generate additional
          traffic, which adds to the overall load.
</li>
<li>A SIP entity needs to set up and maintain overload
          control subscriptions with all upstream and downstream
          neighbors. A new subscription needs to be set up
          before/while a request is transmitted to a new downstream
          neighbor. Servers can be configured to subscribe at boot
          time. However, this would require additional protection to
          avoid the avalanche restart problem for overload
          control. Subscriptions need to be terminated when they are
          not needed any more, which can be done, for example, using a
          timeout mechanism.
</li>
<li>A receiver needs to send NOTIFY messages to all
	  subscribed upstream neighbors in a timely manner when the
	  control algorithm requires a change in the control variable
	  (e.g., when a SIP server is in an overload condition). This
	  includes active as well as inactive neighbors. These NOTIFYs
	  add to the amount of traffic that needs to be processed. To
	  ensure that these requests will not be dropped due to
	  overload, a priority mechanism needs to be implemented in
	  all servers these request will pass through.
</li>
<li>As overload feedback is sent to all senders in separate
	  messages, this mechanism is not suitable when frequent
	  overload control feedback is needed.
</li>
<li>A SIP server can limit the set of senders that can
          receive overload control information by authenticating
          subscriptions to this event package.
</li>
<li>This approach requires each proxy to implement user agent 
          functionality (UAS and UAC) to manage the subscriptions.
</li>

Backwards Compatibility</h3>

<p>An new overload control mechanism needs to be backwards
      compatible so that it can be gradually introduced into a network 
      and functions properly if only a fraction of the servers support 
      it.
</p>
<p>Hop-by-hop overload control (see
      <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-soc-overload-design'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;soc&#8209;overload&#8209;design]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hilt, V., Noel, E., Shen, C., and A. Abdelal, &ldquo;Design Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>) has the
      advantage that it does not require that all SIP entities in a 
      network support it. It can be used effectively between two
      adjacent SIP servers if both servers support overload control
      and does not depend on the support from any other server or user
      agent. The more SIP servers in a network support hop-by-hop
      overload control, the better protected the network is against
      occurrences of overload.
</p>
<p>A SIP server may have multiple upstream neighbors from which
      only some may support overload control. If a server would simply 
      use this overload control mechanism, only those that support it
      would reduce traffic. Others would keep sending at the full rate
      and benefit from the throttling by the servers that support
      overload control. In other words, upstream neighbors that do not
      support overload control would be better off than those that
      do.
</p>
<p>A SIP server should therefore use 5xx responses towards
      upstream neighbors that do not support overload control. The
      server should reject the same amount of requests with 5xx
      responses that would be otherwise be rejected/redirected by the 
      upstream neighbor if it would support overload control. If the
      load condition on the server does not permit the creation of 5xx  
      responses, the server should drop all requests from servers that
      do not support overload control.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Overload control mechanisms can be used by an attacker to
    conduct a denial-of-service attack on a SIP entity if the attacker
    can pretend that the SIP entity is overloaded. When such a forged
    overload indication is received by an upstream SIP entity, it will
    stop sending traffic to the victim. Thus, the victim is 
    subject to a denial-of-service attack.
</p>
<p>An attacker can create forged overload feedback by inserting
    itself into the communication between the victim and its 
    upstream neighbors. The attacker would need to add overload
    feedback indicating a high load to the responses passed from the
    victim to its upstream neighbor. Proxies can prevent this attack by
    communicating via TLS. Since overload feedback has no meaning
    beyond the next hop, there is no need to secure the communication 
    over multiple hops.
</p>
<p>Another way to conduct an attack is to send a message
    containing a high overload feedback value through a proxy that does not
    support this extension. If this feedback is added to the second Via
    headers (or all Via headers), it will reach the next upstream
    proxy. If the attacker can make the recipient believe that the
    overload status was created by its direct downstream neighbor (and
    not by the attacker further downstream) the recipient stops
    sending traffic to the victim. A precondition for this attack is
    that the victim proxy does not support this extension since it
    would not pass through overload control feedback otherwise.
</p>
<p>A malicious SIP entity could gain an advantage by pretending to
    support this specification but never reducing the amount of
    traffic it forwards to the downstream neighbor. If its downstream
    neighbor receives traffic from multiple sources which correctly
    implement overload control, the malicious SIP entity would benefit
    since all other sources to its downstream neighbor would reduce
    load. 
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The solution to this problem depends on the
      overload control method. For rate-based and window-based
      overload control, it is very easy for a downstream entity to
      monitor if the upstream neighbor throttles traffic forwarded as
      directed. For percentage throttling this is not always obvious
      since the load forwarded depends on the load received by the
      upstream neighbor.
</p>
