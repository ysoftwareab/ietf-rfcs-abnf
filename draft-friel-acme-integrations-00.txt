                    draft-friel-acme-integrations-00

Abstract

   This document outlines multiple advanced use cases and integrations
   that ACME facilitates without any modifications or enhancements
   required to the base ACME specification.  These use cases are not
   immediately obvious from reading the ACME specification and thus are
   explicitly documented here.  The use cases include ACME issuance of
   subdomain certificates, and ACME integration with EST and TEAP.

1.  Introduction

   ACME [RFC8555] defines a protocol that a certificate authority (CA)
   and an applicant can use to automate the process of domain name
   ownership validation and X.509 (PKIX) certificate issuance.  The
   protocol is rich and flexible and enables multiple use cases that are
   not immediately obvious from reading the specification.  This
   document explicitly outlines multiple advanced ACME use cases
   including:

   o  ACME issuance of subdomain certificates

   o  ACME integration with EST [RFC7030]

   o  ACME integration with BRSKI
      [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]

   o  ACME integration with TEAP [RFC7170]

   o  ACME integration with TEAP-BRSKI draft-lear-eap-teap-brski

3.  ACME Issuance of Subdomain Certificates

   A typical ACME workflow for issuance of certificates is as follows:

   1.  client POSTs a newOrder request that contains a set of
       "identifiers"

   2.  server replies with a set of "authorizations" and a "finalize"
       URI

   3.  client sends POST-as-GET requests to retrieve the
       "authorizations", with the downloaded "authorization" object(s)
       containing the "identifier" that the client must prove control of

   4.  client proves control over the "identifier" in the
       "authorization" object by completing the specified challenge, for
       example, by pubilshing a DNS TXT record

   5.  client POSTs a CSR to the "finalize" API

   ACME places the following restrictions on "identifiers":

   o  section 7.1.4: the only type of "identifier" defined by the ACME
      specification is a fully qualified domain name

The only type of identifier defined by this specification is a fully qualified domain name (type: "dns"). The domain name MUST be encoded in the form in which it would appear in a certificate.

   o  Section 7.4: the "identifier" in the CSR request must match the
      "identifier" in the newOrder request

The CSR MUST indicate the exact same set of requested identifiers as the initial newOrder request.

   o  Sections 8.3 and 8.4: the "identifier", or FQDN, in the
      "authorization" object must be used when fulfilling challenges via
      HTTP or DNS mechanisms

   Construct a URL by populating the URL template [RFC6570]
   "http://{domain}/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token}", where:

    *  the domain field is set to the domain name being verified

   The client constructs the validation domain name by
   prepending the label "_acme-challenge" to the domain name being
   validated

   ACME does not mandate that the "identifier" in a newOrder request
   matches the "identifier" in "authorization" objects.  This means that
   the ACME specification does not preclude an ACME server processing
   newOrder requests and issuing certificates for a subdomain without
   requiring a challenge to be fulfilled against that explicit
   subdomain.  ACME server policy could allow issuance of certificates
   for a subdomain to a client where the client only has to fulfill an
   authorization challenge for the parent domain.

   This allows a flow where a client proves ownership of "domain.com"
   and then successfully obtains a certificate for "sub.domain.com".
   The ACME pre-authorization flow makes most sense for this use case,
   and that is what is illustrated in the following call flow.

   The client could pre-authorize for the parent domain once, and then
   issue multiple newOrder requests for certificates for multiple
   subdomains.  This call flow illustrates the client only placing one
   newOrder request.

4.  ACME Integration with EST

   EST [RFC7030] defines a mechanism for clients to enroll with a PKI
   Registration Authority by sending CMC messages over HTTP.  EST
   section 1 states:

Architecturally, the EST service is located between a Certification Authority (CA) and a client.  It performs several functions traditionally allocated to the Registration Authority (RA) role in a PKI.

   EST section 1.1 states that:

For certificate issuing services, the EST CA is reached through the EST server; the CA could be logically "behind" the EST server or embedded within it.

Internet-Draft                    ATLS                          May 2019


   When the CA is logically "behind" the EST RA, EST does not specify
   how the RA communicates with the CA.  EST section 1 states:

The nature of communication between an EST server and a CA is not described in this document.

   This section outlines how ACME could be used for communication
   between the EST RA and the CA.  The example call flow shows the RA
   proving ownership of a parent domain, with individual client
   certificates being subdomains under that parent domain.  This is an
   optimisation that reduces DNS and ACME traffic overhead.  The RA
   could of course prove ownership of every explicit client certificate
   identifier.

   The call flow also illustrates how the RA can include relevant domain
   information in the CSR request to ACME that the client may not have
   knowledge of.  For example, a device or pledge may know its MAC
   address and serial number and only include that as its identifier in
   a CSR request.  The RA could insert the domain information into the
   CSR request.  Additionally, for privacy reasons, the RA may not want
   to divulge MAC or serial number information to the CA and could
   additionally assign an opaque random identifier to the device.

5.  ACME Integration with BRSKI

   BRSKI [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] is based upon EST
   [RFC7030] and defines how to autonomically bootstrap PKI trust
   anchors into devices via means of signed vouchers.  EST certificate
   enrollment may then optionally take place after trust has been
   established.  BRKSI voucher exchange and trust establishment are
   based on EST extensions and the certicicate enrollment part of BRSKI
   is fully based on EST.  Similar to EST, BRSKI does not define how the
   EST RA communicates with the CA.  Therefore the mechanisms outlined
   in the previous section for using ACME as the communications protocol
   between the EST RA and the CA are equally applicable to BRSKI.

   The following call flow shows how ACME may be integated into a full
   BRSKI voucher plus EST enrollment workflow.  For brevity, it assumes
   that the EST RA has previously proven ownership of a parent domain
   and that pledge certificate identifiers are a subdomain of that
   parent domain.  The doain owernship excahnges between the RA, ACME
   and DNS are not shown.  Similarly, not all BRSKI interactions are
   shown and only the key protocol flows involving voucher exchange and
   EST enrollment are shown.

6.  ACME Integration with TEAP

   TEAP [RFC7170] define a tunnel-based EAP method that enables secure
   communication between a peer and a server by using TLS to establish a
   mutually authenticated tunnel.  TEAP enables certificate provisioning
   within the tunnel.  TEAP does not define how the TEAP server
   communicates with the CA.

   This section outlines how ACME could be used for communication
   between the TEAP server and the CA.  The example call flow shows the
   TEAP server proving ownership of a parent domain, with individual
   client certificates being subdomains under that parent domain.  This
   is an optimisation that reduces DNS and ACME traffic overhead.  The

   TEAP server could of course prove ownership of every explicit client
   certificate identifier.
