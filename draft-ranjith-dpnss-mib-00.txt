Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects for SNMP-based
   management of DPNSS 1 interfaces.  DPNSS 1 is a common-channel
   signaling system and is primarily intended for use between PBXs in
   private networks via time-slot 16 of 2.048 Mbit/s digital
   transmission system. Similarly it may be used in time-slot 24 of a
   1.544 Mbit/s digital transmission system. The DPNSS 1 protocol is
   completely specified in British Telecom Network Requirement 188
   (BTNR 188) series of specifications [10].

   This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

1. The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      - An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [3].

      - Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD16, RFC 1155 [4], STD 16, RFC 1212 [5] and RFC 1215 [6]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [7], RFC 2579 [8] and RFC 2580 [9].

      - Message protocols for transferring management information.  The

Mukundan/Naganathan/Mangalpally/Anantharaman                         2

Internet Draft     draft-ranjith-dpnss-mib-00.txt         November 2000

        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [10]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [11] and
        RFC 1906 [12]. The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 2272 [13] and RFC 2274 [14].

      - Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [10]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [15].

      - A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [20]
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
        2275 [21].

      Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
      termed the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB
      are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

      This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
      A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the
      appropriate translations. The resulting translated MIB must be
      semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are
      omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
      Some machine-readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
      textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
      However, this loss of machine-readable information is not
      considered to change the semantics of the MIB.


2. Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3. Overview

3.1.  Structure of the MIB

      For managing DPNSS interfaces, the following information is
      necessary:

      o    Information for managing interface related characteristics

Mukundan/Naganathan/Mangalpally/Anantharaman                         3

Internet Draft     draft-ranjith-dpnss-mib-00.txt         November 2000

           specified in IF-MIB [16].

      o    The IANAifType MIB [18] that contains a IANA assigned value
           for DPNSS.

      o    Information for managing the physical T1 or E1 lines that is
           configured as a DPNSS interface specified in the DS1/E1 MIB
           [12]. In case of DPNSS, the E1/T1 line that is configured as
           DPNSS interface cannot be shared across other protocols.

      o    Information for managing the DS0 interface that is
           configured as a DPNSS trunk or link as specified in the DS0
           MIB [19].

      o    Information for managing DPNSS Trunks (Bearer Channels) as
           Specified by this MIB.

      o    Information for managing DPNSS signaling Links as specified
           By this MIB.

      o    Information for managing the 60 DPNSS Data Link Connections
           (DLCs) as specified by this MIB.


      The DPNSS MIB contains information to configure and manage a
      DPNSS interface (trunks/links) and does not cater to provisioning
      and management of any voice or data related DPNSS services like
      Call Back When Free (CBWF), Executive Intrusion (EI), Three Party
      Service (TPS) etc as specified in BTNR 188. These services, as
      describe by BTNR 188, though offered over a DPNSS interface is
      not interface specific (i.e., not necessarily provisionable on a
      per interface basis). Further, information related to the
      provisioning & management of these services are
      implementation/vendor specific.

3.1.1.  General Description

      This MIB controls all aspects of DPNSS interfaces.  The DPNSS
      specific information is organised into 4 tables in this MIB.

      o    The dpnssSigTable is used to provide configuration and
           statistical information regarding DPNSS signaling link
           interfaces.

      o    The dpnssTrkTable is used to provide configuration and
           statistical information regarding DPNSS trunk (bearer)
           interfaces.

      o    The dpnssDLCTable is used to provide information regarding
           the DLCs for one DPNSS signaling Link interface.

      o    The dpnssTrkMappingTable facilitates a faster means to

Internet Draft     draft-ranjith-dpnss-mib-00.txt         November 2000

           correlate the DPNSS trunk interfaces with a specific DPNSS
           Signaling Link interface. This association can also be
           achieved through the ifstackTable and/or the
           dsx0ChanMappingTable defined in the DS0 MIB [19] but would
           require multiple table look-ups and testing of constituent
           entries in the tables involved. The usage of this table is
           illustrated in the subsequent sections.

3.2.    Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

      This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the
      Interfaces MIB [16].  Several areas of correlation are addressed
      in the following subsections. The implementor is referred to the
      Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general intent
      of these areas.

3.2.1.  Layering Model

      A DPNSS interface consists of a signaling channel and a number
      of trunks (bearer channels) - 23 if the DS1 interface is a T1 and
      30 if it is E1. The DPNSS signaling channel and the trunks are
      layered on top of a physical interface - a DS1 interface.

3.2.1.1.  DPNSS Layer 2 and Layer 3 interface representation

      The DPNSS signaling channel interface is composed of a Data Link
      Layer DPNSS Layer 2) and the Network Layer (DPNSS Layer 3). From
      the perspective of this MIB, the DPNSS Layer 2 and DPNSS Layer 3
      is modeled as a single logical interface (ifEntry) to represent
      the DPNSS signaling channel as a whole. The rationale for this
      approach is based on the guidelines proposed in the interfaces
      MIB [16] which recommends that a group of related interfaces be
      treated as a single interface with one entry in the ifTable.

         In case of DPNSS Layer 2 and DPNSS Layer 3:

      o  Neither DPNSS Layer 2 nor DPNSS Layer 3 performs multiplexing
         for any other interface in the agent.

      o  It is useful for all of the ifTable's information (e.g., the
         counters, and the status variables and all of the ifTable's
         capabilities (e.g., write access to ifAdminStatus), to apply
         to DPNSS Layer 2 and DPNSS Layer 3 as a whole.

3.2.1.2.  DPNSS DLC representation

         The DPNSS DLC is a connection-oriented virtual connection
         realized by DPNSS data link layer (DPNSS Layer 2). A DLC can
         be considered as the Level 2 process that controls the
         transfer of Level 3 messages on behalf of on DPNSS signaling
         channel. A DPNSS Data Link Layer may contain up to 60 DLCs,
         i.e., it may support up to 30 Real channels and 30 Virtual

Mukundan/Naganathan/Mangalpally/Anantharaman                         5

Internet Draft     draft-ranjith-dpnss-mib-00.txt         November 2000

         Channels. A Real Channel is a communication (traffic) channel
         which can be used to convey voice or data. A Virtual Channel
         is an information channel, which has no physical realisation
         outside the signaling channel. In any case, each DLC,
         irrespective of whether it realizes a Real or Virtual Channel,
         is in itself a virtual connection.

         The interfaces MIB [16] strongly recommends that connection-
         oriented sub-layers do not have a conceptual row in the
         ifTable for each virtual circuit. This avoids the
         proliferation of conceptual row, especially those which have
         considerable redundant information.

         Hence, each of the 60 DPNSS DLC has a representation only in
         the dpnssDLCTable and does not find a corresponding ifEntry in
         the ifTable.

         The DPNSS Signaling Channel and bearer channel representation
         is accomplished in this MIB by creating a logical interface
         (ifEntry) for each of the signaling channel entities and a
         logical interface (ifEntry) for each of the DPNSS trunks.
         These are then correlated to each other and to the physical
         interface using the ifStackTable of the Interfaces MIB [19].

         The basic model, therefore, looks something like this:

        DPNSS
     Layer 2 & 3   DPNSS TRUNKS ....
       +--+ +--+  +--+ +--+      +--+ +--+
       | Sig   |  | (DS0) |      | (DS0) |
       |Channel|  | trunk | .... | trunk |
       +--+ +--+  +--+ +--+      +--+ +--+
          | |        | |            | |    <== attachment to physical
       +--+ +--------+ +------------+ +----+   interfaces, to be
       |         physical interface        |   provided by ifStackTable
       |              (T1/E1)              |
       +-----------------------------------+
      Mapping of DPNSS Trunks/Signaling channels to physical
                      interfaces


         The ifType for the DPNSS Signaling Channel will be assigned
         by IANA as part of the IANAifType MIB. The ifType for DPNSS
         trunks is ds0(81). The ifType for physical interfaces is
         ds1(18).

3.2.2.  ifStackTable

         The ifStackTable is used to map the DPNSS Signaling Links and
         trunks to physical interfaces (DS1). Since a ds0 interface is
         configured as a DPNSS signaling link or trunk, the
         ifStackTable is also used to map the ds0 interfaces to the

Mukundan/Naganathan/Mangalpally/Anantharaman                         6

         physical interfaces.

         The assignment of index values could for example be as
         follows:


   ifIndex ifType      DPNSS & DS0 MIB tables     Description
                       indexed by ifIndex

                                           (X is the IANAIfType value
                                           for dpnss interfaces
                                           assigned by IANA)
      2    ds0(81)     dpnssTrkTable       DPNSS Trunk #1
      3    ds0(81)     dpnssTrkTable       DPNSS Trunk #2
      4    ds0(81)     dsx0ConfigTable     ds0 interface entry #1 (see
                                           ds0 MIB)
      5    ds0(81)     dsx0ConfigTable     ds0 interface entry #2 (see
                                           ds0 MIB)
      6    ds0(81)     dsx0ConfigTable     ds0 interface entry #3 (see
                                           ds0 MIB)
      7    ds1(18)                         ds1 interface entry


      The corresponding ifStack table entries would then be:

        The ifTestTable is not supported by this MIB.

3.2.4.  ifRcvAddressTable

        The ifRcvAddressTable is not supported by this MIB.

                        connected to the network, but without call
                        activity. The operational status is down(2) if
                        the hardware has detected that there is no

                        For other values, refer to the Interfaces MIB.
                        These values should be representative of the
                        Status of DPNSS Layer 2 and Layer 3.
                        Operational Status unique to the individual
                        Layers will be catered to by the dpnssSigTable
                        Entries.

                        Relationship to the dpnssSigLinkOperStatus:
                        - if the ifOperStatus is in dormant state, then

                        interface can be configured as bearer channel
                        for any protocol, this value can be used to
                        identity a ds0 interface as being configured as
                        a DPNSS trunk.

3.3.  Relationship to other MIBs

3.3.1. Relationship to the DS1/E1 MIB

         Implementation of the DS1/E1 MIB [12] is required for
         supporting this MIB. The MIB should conform to
         ds1MibE1PriCompliance for DPNSS interfaces implemented over E1
         lines and should conform to ds1MibT1PriCompliance for DPNSS
         interfaces implemented over T1 lines.

         The ds1NearEndConfigGroup & ds1NearEndStatisticsGroup should
         be implemented.

      dsx1LineType      set to dsx1E1CRC for E1 and dsx1ESF T1.

      dsx1LineCoding    Type of zero code suppression is set to
                        dsx1HDB3 for E1 and dsx1B8ZS for T1.

      dsx1SignalMode    set to messageOriented. The DPNSS interfaces
                        are always message oriented for both E1 & T1."

      dsx1TransmitClockSource
                        Set to loopTiming. The transmit clock is
                        derived from received clock on the DPNSS
                        Interfaces."

Internet Draft     draft-ranjith-dpnss-mib-00.txt         November 2000

      For details on the other members of the ds1NearEndConfigGroup &
      ds1NearEndStatisticsGroup refer to DS1 MIB.

3.3.2.  Relationship to the DS0 and DS0Bundle MIBs

         The DPNSS Trunk and Link interfaces are all DS0 interfaces.
         Implementation of the DS0 MIB [13] is required for supporting
         this MIB.

         The ds0ConfigGroup should be implemented.

      dsx0Ds0ChannelNumber
                        This object indicates the channel number of the
                        ds0 on its DS1/E1.

      dsx0RobbedBitSignalling
                        This object indicates if Robbed Bit Signaling
                        is turned on or off for a given ds0.  This only
                        applies to DS0s on a DS1 link.  For E1 links
                        the value is always off (false).

      dsx0CircuitIdentifier
                        This object contains the transmission vendor's
                        circuit identifier, for the purpose of
                        facilitating troubleshooting.

   For other members of the ds0ConfigGroup refer to the DS0 MIB. The
   use of dsx0ChanMappingTable is recommended as a DS1 interface is
   channelized to support the DS0 interfaces.

   DS0Bundle MIB is not required.

3.4     dpnssTrkMappingTable usage/implementation Guidelines

          An example is given here to explain the trunk mapping objects
          provided in the MIB to help the implementor use the objects
          correctly.

          Assume that a DPNSS signaling channel with ifIndex 1 is used
          to signal for 30 trunks (i.e., a E1). Since the DPNSS trunks
          will have an corresponding ifEntry in the ifTable, there will
          be 30 ifEntries in the if table for the DPNSS Trunks. The
          dpnssTrkMappingTable will have an entry for the DPNSS
          signaling channel. Hence, the entries will be as follows.

            ifIndex   dpnssTrkNum      dpnssTrkMappingIfIndex
              1         1                     2
              1         2                     3
              ......
              1         30(24 if T1)          31(25 if T1).

          Where ifIndex is the ifIndex of the DPNSS signaling channel

          that can retrieved from the dpnssSigTable (i.e., the value of
          dpnssSigIfIndex), dpnssTrkNum is the DPNSS trunk number whose
          and dpnssTrkMappingIfIndex is the IfIndex of the DPNSS Trunk
          associated with this DPNSS signaling channel.

          This object also provides information that can be
          indirectly retrieved using the ifStackTable using the ds0 and
          ds1 ifEntries. Note that the ds0 MIB contains information to
          associate & map ds1 channelization for ds0 interfaces.

           STATUS      current
           DESCRIPTION
               "Parameter specifying the different DPNSS Signaling
                channel states.

                The maintenance states - bsy, inb and offline does not
                directly correspond to a DLC state in the DLC table. In
                this state the DLCs state should be either one of oos
                or resetAttempt.

                oos - Out Of Service
                This State can be entered immediately following power
                up or due to a maintenance action, eg following reset
                failure. It is the state in which all DLCs exist before
                activation of the Data Link Layer. A DLC remains in the
                'Out of Service' state if it is not being used across a
                particular physical link. In this state all received
                frames are ignored. The oos status in the dpnssSigTable
                indicates that all the corresponding DLCs are in oos
                state.

                idle
                This is the state which a DLC enters from the OOS state
                while awaiting to be started. In this state reset
                requests from the remote PBX are not ignored, as in the
                Out of service state. If a DLC is reset remotely the
                local data link layer does not need to reset it. When a
                DLC is started up locally it moves from this state to
                Reset Attempted. The idle status in the dpnssSigTable
                indicates that all the corresponding DLCs are idle
                state.

                resetAttempted
                This is the state which a DLC enters when a reset
                request is sent on it. The DLC enters the Reset
                Complete state on completion of the reset procedure.
                The resetAttempted status in the dpnssSigTable
                indicates that all the corresponding DLCs are in
                resetAttempted state.

                resetComplete
                This is the state of a DLC which has just been
                successfuly reset. In this state, all the state
                variables are set to 0. The resetComplete status in the
                dpnssSigTable indicates that all the corresponding DLCs
                are in resetComplete state

                overload
                This indicates that a DLC is not able to process the L2
                messages due to various overload reasons which can
                result for example when the layer 2 peer DLC is sending

                messages at a rate faster than the what the near-end
                can handle. The overload status in the dpnssSigTable
                indicates that all the corresponding DLCs are in
                overload state.

                recvOverrun - receive overrun
                This indicates that the DLC is receiving layer 2
                messages from a peer at a rate faster than it can
                buffer/process. The recvOverrun status in the
                dpnssSigTable indicates that all the corresponding DLCs
                are in recvOverrun state.

                babbling
                This indicates the receipt of an unexpected 'glitch-
                message' on all the DLCs.

                crptMsg - corrupt message
                This indicates the receipt of a corrupt (but correctly
                framed) DPNSS Layer 2 message on all the DLCs catered
                by this DPNSS signaling channel.

                The states - oos, idle, resetAttempted,
                resetComplete, infoTransfer and overload of this table
                is applicable to all the DLCs & reflects the status of
                all the DLCs. This value should match the corresponding
                OperStatus of the DLC Table. This option is provided so
                that the implentors have the flexibility of
                setting/reading the states of all DLCs in one shot
                rather than walking through all the entries of the DLC
                table.

                bsy - busy
                Indicates a maintenance operation status of the
                signaling channel during which this link will not be
                used for signaling. Generally this is the value
                during some maintenance actions on the DPNSS link.

                inB - installation Busy
                Indicates a maintenance operation of the signaling
                channel during which, apart from this channel not being
                available for signaling, the configuration parameters
                (mostly ds0 characteristics of this interface) can be
                changed. The implementor may chose to just use the bsy
                state as a superset state instead of inB in which case
                this state will be rendered redundant.

                offLine -
                Indicates a maintenance operation of this signaling
                channel  during which, apart from this channel not
                being available for call processing, the dpnss link
                interface configuration parameters also cannot be
                changed. This state is used to completely delete this

                configure this interface. The vendor may just chose to
                just use the inB state as a superset state instead of
                offline in which case this state will be rendered
                redundant.

                pInSv - Partial Inservice
                This indicates that some DLCs (atleast 1 DLC) are

                in Reset Complete, Information Transfer or Idle state.

                pOverload - Partial Overload
                This indicates that some DLCs (atleast 1 DLC) is in
                overload state."

                states.

                oos - Out Of Service
                This State can be entered immediately following power
                up or due to a maintenance action, eg following reset
                failure. It is the state in which all DLCs exist before
                activation of the Data Link Layer. A DLC remains in the
                'Out of Service' state if it is not being used across a
                particular physical link. In this state all received
                frames are ignored.

                idle
                This is the state which a DLC enters from the OOS state
                while awaiting to be started. In this state reset
                requests from the remote PBX are not ignored, as in the
                Out of service state. If a DLC is reset remotely the
                local data link layer does not need to reset it. When a
                DLC is started up locally it moves from this state to
                Reset Attempted.

                resetAttempted
                This is the state which a DLC enters when a reset
                request is sent on it. The DLC enters the Reset
                Complete state on completion of the reset procedure.

                resetComplete
                This is the state of a DLC which has just been
                successfuly reset. In this state, all the state
                variables are set to 0.

                overload
                This indicates that a DLC is not able to process the L2
                messages due to various overload reasons which can

                messages at a rate faster than the what the near-end
                can handle.

                recvOverrun - receive overrun
                This indicates that the DLC is receiving layer 2
                messages from a peer at a rate faster than it can
                buffer/process.

                babbling
                This indicates the receipt of an unexpected 'glitch-
                message' on all this DLC.

                crptMsg - corrupt message

                Service.

                inB - installation Busy
                Indicates a maintenance operation of the trunk during
                which, apart from this trunk not being available for
                call processing, the configuration parameters (like
                dpnssTrkDir etc) of the trunk can be changed. The

                parameters also cannot be changed. This state is used
                normally to completely delete this interface and
                reconfigure as some other interface. The vendor may
                just chose to just use the inB state as a superset
                state instead of offline in which case this state will
                be rendered redundant. Further, the DS1 interface over

5. Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.


   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [21] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP

   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

   Setting any of the following objects to an inappropriate value can
   cause loss of traffic.  The definition of inappropriate varies for
   each object.  In the case of dpnssSigLinkOperStatus &
   dpnssDLCOperStatus, both of which are read-write objects, if the

   states are set to out of service (oos) there will the traffic on
   these interfaces will stop and create bottlenecks/overload on other
   interfaces. In the case of DLC & DPNSS Link transmission timeouts
   and number of re-transmissions if set to a unrealistically low value
   will result in calls dropping on that interface that is being
   manipulated.


      dpnssSigLinkOperStatus
      dpnssDLCOperStatus
      dpnssDLCReTxns
      dpnssDLCReTxnTimeout
      dpnssSigLinkReTxns
      dpnssSigLinkReTxnTimeout
      dpnssSigEndPtType
      dpnssTrkOperStatus


Mukundan/Naganathan/Mangalpally/Anantharaman                        35

Internet Draft     draft-ranjith-dpnss-mib-00.txt         November 2000

      dpnssTrkDir

   Setting the following objects is mischievous, but not harmful to

   traffic.

      dpnssSigInfoTrapEnable
      dpnssSigLinkReTxnAckTimeout
      dpnssDLCInfoTrapEnable
      dpnssDLCReTxnAckTimeout
      dpnssTrkIfAddress


If the implentor specific trap thresholds for the DPNSS signaling
channel and DLC are set to a low inappropriate value (or if the
thresholds are not implemented for agents that require it), then the
manager will be flooded with traps (if the traps are enabled for the
interfaces) and can potentially hog the network bandwidth between the
agent and the manager.
