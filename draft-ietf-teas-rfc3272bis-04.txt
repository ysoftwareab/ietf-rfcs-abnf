Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the principles of Internet traffic
   engineering (TE).  The objective of the document is to articulate the
   general issues and principles for Internet traffic engineering, and
   where appropriate to provide recommendations, guidelines, and options
   for the development of online and offline Internet traffic
   engineering capabilities and support systems.

   This document provides a terminology and taxonomy for describing and
   understanding common Internet traffic engineering concepts.

   Even though Internet traffic engineering is most effective when
   applied end-to-end, the focus of this document is traffic engineering
   within a given domain (such as an autonomous system).  However,
   because a preponderance of Internet traffic tends to originate in one
   autonomous system and terminate in another, this document also
   provides an overview of aspects pertaining to inter-domain traffic
   engineering.

   This work was first published as [RFC3272] in May 2002.  This
   document obsoletes [RFC3272] by making a complete update to bring the
   text in line with best current practices for Internet traffic
   engineering and to include references to the latest relevant work in
   the IETF.  It is worth noting around three fifths of the RFCs
   referenced in this document post-date the publication of RFC 3272.
   Appendix C provides a summary of changes between RFC 3272 and this
   document.

1.1.  What is Internet Traffic Engineering?

   One of the most significant functions performed by the Internet is
   the routing of traffic from ingress nodes to egress nodes.
   Therefore, one of the most distinctive functions performed by
   Internet traffic engineering is the control and optimization of the
   routing function, to steer traffic through the network.

   Internet traffic engineering is defined as that aspect of Internet
   network engineering dealing with the issues of performance evaluation
   and performance optimization of operational IP networks.  Traffic
   engineering encompasses the application of technology and scientific
   principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and
   control of Internet traffic [RFC2702], [AWD2].

   It is the performance of the network as seen by end users of network
   services that is paramount.  The characteristics visible to end users
   are the emergent properties of the network, which are the
   characteristics of the network when viewed as a whole.  A central

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   goal of the service provider, therefore, is to enhance the emergent
   properties of the network while taking economic considerations into
   account.  This is accomplished by addressing traffic oriented
   performance requirements while utilizing network resources
   economically and reliably.  Traffic oriented performance measures
   include delay, delay variation, packet loss, and throughput.

   Internet traffic engineering responds to network events.  Aspects of
   capacity management respond at intervals ranging from days to years.
   Routing control functions operate at intervals ranging from
   milliseconds to days.  Packet level processing functions operate at
   very fine levels of temporal resolution, ranging from picoseconds to
   milliseconds while reacting to the real-time statistical behavior of
   traffic.

   Thus, the optimization aspects of traffic engineering can be viewed
   from a control perspective, and can be both pro-active and reactive.
   In the pro-active case, the traffic engineering control system takes
   preventive action to protect against predicted unfavorable future
   network states, for example, by engineering backup paths.  It may
   also take action that will lead to a more desirable future network
   state.  In the reactive case, the control system responds to correct
   issues and adapt to network events, such as routing after failure.

   Another important objective of Internet traffic engineering is to
   facilitate reliable network operations [RFC2702].  Reliable network
   operations can be facilitated by providing mechanisms that enhance
   network integrity and by embracing policies emphasizing network
   survivability.  This reduces the vulnerability of services to outages
   arising from errors, faults, and failures occurring within the
   network infrastructure.

   The optimization aspects of traffic engineering can be achieved
   through capacity management and traffic management.  In this
   document, capacity management includes capacity planning, routing
   control, and resource management.  Network resources of particular
   interest include link bandwidth, buffer space, and computational
   resources.  In this document, traffic management includes:

   1.  nodal traffic control functions such as traffic conditioning,
       queue management, scheduling

   2.  other functions that regulate traffic flow through the network or
       that arbitrate access to network resources between different
       packets or between different traffic streams.

   One major challenge of Internet traffic engineering is the
   realization of automated control capabilities that adapt quickly and

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   cost effectively to significant changes in network state, while still
   maintaining stability of the network.  Performance evaluation can
   assess the effectiveness of traffic engineering methods, and the
   results of this evaluation can be used to identify existing problems,
   guide network re-optimization, and aid in the prediction of potential
   future problems.  However, this process can also be time consuming
   and may not be suitable to act on short-lived changes in the network.

   Performance evaluation can be achieved in many different ways.  The
   most notable techniques include analytical methods, simulation, and
   empirical methods based on measurements.

   Traffic engineering comes in two flavors: either a background process
   that constantly monitors traffic and optimizes the use of resources
   to improve performance; or a form of a pre-planned optimized traffic
   distribution that is considered optimal.  In the later case, any
   deviation from the optimum distribution (e.g., caused by a fiber cut)
   is reverted upon repair without further optimization.  However, this
   form of traffic engineering relies upon the notion that the planned
   state of the network is optimal.  Hence, in such a mode there are two
   levels of traffic engineering: the TE-planning task to enable optimum
   traffic distribution, and the routing task keeping traffic flows
   attached to the pre-planned distribution.

   As a general rule, traffic engineering concepts and mechanisms must
   be sufficiently specific and well-defined to address known
   requirements, but simultaneously flexible and extensible to
   accommodate unforeseen future demands.

1.2.  Components of Traffic Engineering

   As mentioned in Section 1.1, Internet traffic engineering provides
   performance optimization of operational IP networks while utilizing
   network resources economically and reliably.  Such optimization is
   supported at the control/controller level and within the data/
   forwarding plane.

   The key elements required in any TE solution are as follows:

   1.  Policy

   2.  Path steering

   3.  Resource management

   Some TE solutions rely on these elements to a lesser or greater
   extent.  Debate remains about whether a solution can truly be called
   traffic engineering if it does not include all of these elements.



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   For the sake of this document, we assert that all TE solutions must
   include some aspects of all of these elements.  Other solutions can
   be classed as "partial TE" and also fall in scope of this document.

   Policy allows for the selection of next hops and paths based on
   information beyond basic reachability.  Early definitions of routing
   policy, e.g., [RFC1102] and [RFC1104], discuss routing policy being
   applied to restrict access to network resources at an aggregate
   level.  BGP is an example of a commonly used mechanism for applying
   such policies, see [RFC4271] and [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis].  In the
   traffic engineering context, policy decisions are made within the
   control plane or by controllers, and govern the selection of paths.
   Examples can be found in [RFC4655] and [RFC5394].  Standard TE
   solutions may cover the mechanisms to distribute and/or enforce
   polices, but specific policy definition is generally unspecified.

   Path steering is the ability to forward packets using more
   information than just knowledge of the next hop.  Examples of path
   steering include IPv4 source routes [RFC0791], RSVP-TE explicit
   routes [RFC3209], and Segment Routing [RFC8402].  Path steering for
   TE can be supported via control plane protocols, by encoding in the
   data plane headers, or by a combination of the two.  This includes
   when control is provided by a controller using a southbound (i.e.,
   controller to router) control protocol.

   Resource management provides resource aware control and forwarding.
   Examples of resources are bandwidth, buffers, and queues, all of
   which can be managed to control loss and latency.

      Resource reservation is the control aspect of resource management.
      It provides for domain-wide consensus about which network
      resources are used by a particular flow.  This determination may
      be made at a very course or very fine level.  Note that this
      consensus exists at the network control or controller level, not
      within the data plane.  It may be composed purely of accounting/
      bookkeeping, but it typically includes an ability to admit,
      reject, or reclassify a flow based on policy.  Such accounting can
      be done based on any combination of a static understanding of
      resource requirements, and the use of dynamic mechanisms to
      collect requirements (e.g., via [RFC3209]) and resource
      availability (e.g., via [RFC4203]).

      Resource allocation is the data plane aspect of resource
      management.  It provides for the allocation of specific node and
      link resources to specific flows.  Example resources include
      buffers, policing, and rate-shaping mechanisms that are typically
      supported via queuing.  It also includes the matching of a flow
      (i.e., flow classification) to a particular set of allocated

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


      resources.  The method of flow classification and granularity of
      resource management is technology specific.  Examples include
      DiffServ with dropping and remarking [RFC4594], MPLS-TE [RFC3209],
      and GMPLS based label switched paths [RFC3945], as well as
      controller-based solutions [RFC8453].  This level of resource
      control, while optional, is important in networks that wish to
      support congestion management policies to control or regulate the
      offered traffic to deliver different levels of service and
      alleviate congestion problems, or those networks that wish to
      control latencies experienced by specific traffic flows.

1.3.  Scope

   The scope of this document is intra-domain traffic engineering.  That
   is, traffic engineering within a given autonomous system in the
   Internet.  This document discusses concepts pertaining to intra-
   domain traffic control, including such issues as routing control,
   micro and macro resource allocation, and the control coordination
   problems that arise consequently.

   This document describes and characterizes techniques already in use
   or in advanced development for Internet traffic engineering.  The way
   these techniques fit together is discussed and scenarios in which
   they are useful will be identified.

   Although the emphasis in this document is on intra-domain traffic
   engineering, in Section 7, an overview of the high level
   considerations pertaining to inter-domain traffic engineering will be
   provided.  Inter-domain Internet traffic engineering is crucial to
   the performance enhancement of the global Internet infrastructure.

   Whenever possible, relevant requirements from existing IETF documents
   and other sources are incorporated by reference.

1.4.  Terminology

   This section provides terminology which is useful for Internet
   traffic engineering.  The definitions presented apply to this
   document.  These terms may have other meanings elsewhere.

   Busy hour:  A one hour period within a specified interval of time
      (typically 24 hours) in which the traffic load in a network or
      sub-network is greatest.

   Congestion:  A state of a network resource in which the traffic
      incident on the resource exceeds its output capacity over an
      interval of time.

   Congestion avoidance:  An approach to congestion management that
      attempts to obviate the occurrence of congestion.

   Congestion control:  An approach to congestion management that
      attempts to remedy congestion problems that have already occurred.

   Constraint-based routing:  A class of routing protocols that take
      specified traffic attributes, network constraints, and policy
      constraints into account when making routing decisions.
      Constraint-based routing is applicable to traffic aggregates as
      well as flows.  It is a generalization of QoS routing.

   Demand side congestion management:  A congestion management scheme
      that addresses congestion problems by regulating or conditioning
      offered load.

   Effective bandwidth:  The minimum amount of bandwidth that can be
      assigned to a flow or traffic aggregate in order to deliver
      'acceptable service quality' to the flow or traffic aggregate.

   Hot-spot:  A network element or subsystem which is in a state of
      congestion.

   Inter-domain traffic:  Traffic that originates in one Autonomous
      system and terminates in another.

   Metric:  A parameter defined in terms of standard units of
      measurement.

   Measurement methodology:  A repeatable measurement technique used to
      derive one or more metrics of interest.

   Network survivability:  The capability to provide a prescribed level
      of QoS for existing services after a given number of failures
      occur within the network.

   Offline traffic engineering:  A traffic engineering system that
      exists outside of the network.

   Online traffic engineering:  A traffic engineering system that exists
      within the network, typically implemented on or as adjuncts to
      operational network elements.

   Traffic trunk:  An aggregation of traffic flows belonging to the same
      class which are forwarded through a common path.  A traffic trunk
      may be characterized by an ingress and egress node, and a set of
      attributes which determine its behavioral characteristics and
      requirements from the network.

2.  Background

   The Internet must convey IP packets from ingress nodes to egress
   nodes efficiently, expeditiously, and economically.  Furthermore, in
   a multiclass service environment (e.g., Diffserv capable networks -
   see Section 4.1.4), the resource sharing parameters of the network
   must be appropriately determined and configured according to
   prevailing policies and service models to resolve resource contention
   issues arising from mutual interference between packets traversing
   through the network.  Thus, consideration must be given to resolving
   competition for network resources between traffic streams belonging
   to the same service class (intra-class contention resolution) and
   traffic streams belonging to different classes (inter-class
   contention resolution).

2.1.  Context of Internet Traffic Engineering

   The context of Internet traffic engineering includes:

   1.  A network domain context that defines the scope under
       consideration, and in particular the situations in which the
       traffic engineering problems occur.  The network domain context
       includes network structure, network policies, network
       characteristics, network constraints, network quality attributes,
       and network optimization criteria.

   2.  A problem context defining the general and concrete issues that
       traffic engineering addresses.  The problem context includes
       identification, abstraction of relevant features, representation,
       formulation, specification of the requirements on the solution
       space, and specification of the desirable features of acceptable
       solutions.

   3.  A solution context suggesting how to address the issues
       identified by the problem context.  The solution context includes
       analysis, evaluation of alternatives, prescription, and
       resolution.

   4.  An implementation and operational context in which the solutions
       are instantiated.  The implementation and operational context
       includes planning, organization, and execution.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   The context of Internet traffic engineering and the different problem
   scenarios are discussed in the following subsections.

2.2.  Network Domain Context

   IP networks range in size from small clusters of routers situated
   within a given location, to thousands of interconnected routers,
   switches, and other components distributed all over the world.

   At the most basic level of abstraction, an IP network can be
   represented as a distributed dynamic system consisting of:

   o  a set of interconnected resources which provide transport services
      for IP traffic subject to certain constraints

   o  a demand system representing the offered load to be transported
      through the network

   o  a response system consisting of network processes, protocols, and
      related mechanisms which facilitate the movement of traffic
      through the network (see also [AWD2]).

   The network elements and resources may have specific characteristics
   restricting the manner in which the traffic demand is handled.
   Additionally, network resources may be equipped with traffic control
   mechanisms managing the way in which the demand is serviced.  Traffic
   control mechanisms may be used to:

   o  control packet processing activities within a given resource

   o  arbitrate contention for access to the resource by different
      packets

   o  regulate traffic behavior through the resource.

   A configuration management and provisioning system may allow the
   settings of the traffic control mechanisms to be manipulated by
   external or internal entities in order to exercise control over the
   way in which the network elements respond to internal and external
   stimuli.

   The details of how the network carries packets are specified in the
   policies of the network administrators and are installed through
   network configuration management and policy based provisioning
   systems.  Generally, the types of service provided by the network
   also depend upon the technology and characteristics of the network
   elements and protocols, the prevailing service and utility models,




Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   and the ability of the network administrators to translate policies
   into network configurations.

   Internet networks have three significant characteristics:

   o  they provide real-time services

   o  they are mission critical

   o  their operating environments are very dynamic.

   The dynamic characteristics of IP and IP/MPLS networks can be
   attributed in part to fluctuations in demand, to the interaction
   between various network protocols and processes, to the rapid
   evolution of the infrastructure which demands the constant inclusion
   of new technologies and new network elements, and to transient and
   persistent faults which occur within the system.

   Packets contend for the use of network resources as they are conveyed
   through the network.  A network resource is considered to be
   congested if, for an interval of time, the arrival rate of packets
   exceed the output capacity of the resource.  Congestion may result in
   some of the arriving packets being delayed or even dropped.

   Congestion increases transit delay, delay variation, may lead to
   packet loss, and reduces the predictability of network services.
   Clearly, congestion is highly undesirable.  Combating congestion at a
   reasonable cost is a major objective of Internet traffic engineering.

   Efficient sharing of network resources by multiple traffic streams is
   a basic operational premise for the Internet.  A fundamental
   challenge in network operation is to increase resource utilization
   while minimizing the possibility of congestion.

   The Internet has to function in the presence of different classes of
   traffic with different service requirements.  RFC 2475 provides an
   architecture for Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and makes this
   requirement clear [RFC2475].  The RFC allows packets to be grouped
   into behavior aggregates such that each aggregate has a common set of
   behavioral characteristics or a common set of delivery requirements.
   Delivery requirements of a specific set of packets may be specified
   explicitly or implicitly.  Two of the most important traffic delivery
   requirements are capacity constraints and QoS constraints.

   Capacity constraints can be expressed statistically as peak rates,
   mean rates, burst sizes, or as some deterministic notion of effective
   bandwidth.  QoS requirements can be expressed in terms of:

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   o  integrity constraints such as packet loss

   o  temporal constraints such as timing restrictions for the delivery
      of each packet (delay) and timing restrictions for the delivery of
      consecutive packets belonging to the same traffic stream (delay
      variation).

2.3.  Problem Context

   There are several large problems associated with operating a network
   described in the previous section.  This section analyzes the problem
   context in relation to traffic engineering.  The identification,
   abstraction, representation, and measurement of network features
   relevant to traffic engineering are significant issues.

   A particular challenge is to formulate the problems that traffic
   engineering attempts to solve.  For example:

   o  how to identify the requirements on the solution space

   o  how to specify the desirable features of solutions

   o  how to actually solve the problems

   o  how to measure and characterize the effectiveness of solutions.

   Another class of problems is how to measure and estimate relevant
   network state parameters.  Effective traffic engineering relies on a
   good estimate of the offered traffic load as well as a view of the
   underlying topology and associated resource constraints.  A network-
   wide view of the topology is also a must for offline planning.

   Still another class of problem is how to characterize the state of
   the network and how to evaluate its performance.  The performance
   evaluation problem is two-fold: one aspect relates to the evaluation
   of the system-level performance of the network; the other aspect
   relates to the evaluation of resource-level performance, which
   restricts attention to the performance analysis of individual network
   resources.

   In this document, we refer to the system-level characteristics of the
   network as the "macro-states" and the resource-level characteristics
   as the "micro-states."  The system-level characteristics are also
   known as the emergent properties of the network.  Correspondingly, we
   refer to the traffic engineering schemes dealing with network
   performance optimization at the systems level as "macro-TE" and the
   schemes that optimize at the individual resource level as "micro-TE."
   Under certain circumstances, the system-level performance can be



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   derived from the resource-level performance using appropriate rules
   of composition, depending upon the particular performance measures of
   interest.

   Another fundamental class of problem concerns how to effectively
   optimize network performance.  Performance optimization may entail
   translating solutions for specific traffic engineering problems into
   network configurations.  Optimization may also entail some degree of
   resource management control, routing control, and capacity
   augmentation.

2.3.1.  Congestion and its Ramifications

   Congestion is one of the most significant problems in an operational
   IP context.  A network element is said to be congested if it
   experiences sustained overload over an interval of time.  Congestion
   almost always results in degradation of service quality to end users.
   Congestion control schemes can include demand-side policies and
   supply-side policies.  Demand-side policies may restrict access to
   congested resources or dynamically regulate the demand to alleviate
   the overload situation.  Supply-side policies may expand or augment
   network capacity to better accommodate offered traffic.  Supply-side
   policies may also re-allocate network resources by redistributing
   traffic over the infrastructure.  Traffic redistribution and resource
   re-allocation serve to increase the 'effective capacity' of the
   network.

   The emphasis of this document is primarily on congestion management
   schemes falling within the scope of the network, rather than on
   congestion management systems dependent upon sensitivity and
   adaptivity from end-systems.  That is, the aspects that are
   considered in this document with respect to congestion management are
   those solutions that can be provided by control entities operating on
   the network and by the actions of network administrators and network
   operations systems.

2.4.  Solution Context

   The solution context for Internet traffic engineering involves
   analysis, evaluation of alternatives, and choice between alternative
   courses of action.  Generally the solution context is based on making
   reasonable inferences about the current or future state of the
   network, and making decisions that may involve a preference between
   alternative sets of action.  More specifically, the solution context
   demands reasonable estimates of traffic workload, characterization of
   network state, derivation of solutions which may be implicitly or
   explicitly formulated, and possibly instantiating a set of control
   actions.  Control actions may involve the manipulation of parameters

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   associated with routing, control over tactical capacity acquisition,
   and control over the traffic management functions.

   The following list of instruments may be applicable to the solution
   context of Internet traffic engineering.

   o  A set of policies, objectives, and requirements (which may be
      context dependent) for network performance evaluation and
      performance optimization.

   o  A collection of online and possibly offline tools and mechanisms
      for measurement, characterization, modeling, and control traffic,
      and control over the placement and allocation of network
      resources, as well as control over the mapping or distribution of
      traffic onto the infrastructure.

   o  A set of constraints on the operating environment, the network
      protocols, and the traffic engineering system itself.

   o  A set of quantitative and qualitative techniques and methodologies
      for abstracting, formulating, and solving traffic engineering
      problems.

   o  A set of administrative control parameters which may be
      manipulated through a Configuration Management (CM) system.  The
      CM system itself may include a configuration control subsystem, a
      configuration repository, a configuration accounting subsystem,
      and a configuration auditing subsystem.

   o  A set of guidelines for network performance evaluation,
      performance optimization, and performance improvement.

   Determining traffic characteristics through measurement or estimation
   is very useful within the realm the traffic engineering solution
   space.  Traffic estimates can be derived from customer subscription
   information, traffic projections, traffic models, and from actual
   measurements.  The measurements may be performed at different levels,
   e.g., at the traffic-aggregate level or at the flow level.
   Measurements at the flow level or on small traffic aggregates may be
   performed at edge nodes, when traffic enters and leaves the network.
   Measurements for large traffic-aggregates may be performed within the
   core of the network.

   To conduct performance studies and to support planning of existing
   and future networks, a routing analysis may be performed to determine
   the paths the routing protocols will choose for various traffic
   demands, and to ascertain the utilization of network resources as
   traffic is routed through the network.  Routing analysis captures the

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   selection of paths through the network, the assignment of traffic
   across multiple feasible routes, and the multiplexing of IP traffic
   over traffic trunks (if such constructs exist) and over the
   underlying network infrastructure.  A model of network topology is
   necessary to perform routing analysis.  A network topology model may
   be extracted from:

   o  network architecture documents

   o  network designs

   o  information contained in router configuration files

   o  routing databases

   o  routing tables

   o  automated tools that discover and collate network topology
      information.

   Topology information may also be derived from servers that monitor
   network state, and from servers that perform provisioning functions.

   Routing in operational IP networks can be administratively controlled
   at various levels of abstraction including the manipulation of BGP
   attributes and IGP metrics.  For path oriented technologies such as
   MPLS, routing can be further controlled by the manipulation of
   relevant traffic engineering parameters, resource parameters, and
   administrative policy constraints.  Within the context of MPLS, the
   path of an explicitly routed label switched path (LSP) can be
   computed and established in various ways including:

   o  manually

   o  automatically, online using constraint-based routing processes
      implemented on label switching routers

   o  automatically, offline using constraint-based routing entities
      implemented on external traffic engineering support systems.

2.4.1.  Combating the Congestion Problem

   Minimizing congestion is a significant aspect of Internet traffic
   engineering.  This subsection gives an overview of the general
   approaches that have been used or proposed to combat congestion.






Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Congestion management policies can be categorized based upon the
   following criteria (see [YARE95] for a more detailed taxonomy of
   congestion control schemes):

   1.  Congestion Management based on Response Time Scales

       *  Long (weeks to months): Expanding network capacity by adding
          new equipement, routers, and links takes time and is
          comparatively costly.  Capacity planning needs to take this
          into consideration.  Network capacity is expanded based on
          estimates or forcasts of future traffic development and
          traffic distribution.  These upgrades are typically carried
          out over weeks or months, or maybe even years.

       *  Medium (minutes to days): Several control policies fall within
          the medium timescale category.  Examples include:

          a.  Adjusting routing protocol parameters to route traffic
              away or towards certain segments of the network.

          b.  Setting up or adjusting explicitly routed LSPs in MPLS
              networks to route traffic trunks away from possibly
              congested resources or toward possibly more favorable
              routes.

          c.  Re-configuring the logical topology of the network to make
              it correlate more closely with the spatial traffic
              distribution using, for example, an underlying path-
              oriented technology such as MPLS LSPs or optical channel
              trails.

          Many of these adaptive schemes rely on measurement systems.  A
          measurement system monitors changes in traffic distribution,
          traffic loads, and network resource utilization and then
          provides feedback to the online or offline traffic engineering
          mechanisms and tools so that they can trigger control actions
          within the network.  The traffic engineering mechanisms and
          tools can be implemented in a distributed or centralized
          fashion.  A centralized scheme may have global visibility into
          the network state and may produce more optimal solutions.
          However, centralized schemes are prone to single points of
          failure and may not scale as well as distributed schemes.
          Moreover, the information utilized by a centralized scheme may
          be stale and might not reflect the actual state of the
          network.  It is not an objective of this document to make a
          recommendation between distributed and centralized schemes:
          that is a choice that network administrators must make based
          on their specific needs.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


       *  Short (picoseconds to minutes): This category includes packet
          level processing functions and events that are recorded on the
          order of several round trip times.  It also includes router
          mechanisms such as passive and active buffer management.  All
          of these mechanisms are used to control congestion or signal
          congestion to end systems so that they can adaptively regulate
          the rate at which traffic is injected into the network.  One
          of the most popular active queue management schemes,
          especially for TCP traffic, is Random Early Detection (RED)
          [FLJA93].  During congestion (but before the queue is filled),
          the RED scheme chooses arriving packets to "mark" according to
          a probabilistic algorithm which takes into account the average
          queue size.  A router that does not utilize explicit
          congestion notification (ECN) [FLOY94] can simply drop marked
          packets to aleviate congestion and implicitly notify the
          receiver about the congestion.  On the other hand, if the
          router supports ECN, it can set the ECN field in the packet
          header.  Several variations of RED have been proposed to
          support different drop precedence levels in multi-class
          environments [RFC2597].  RED provides congestion avoidance
          which is not worse than traditional Tail-Drop (TD) queue
          management (drop arriving packets only when the queue is
          full).  Importantly, RED reduces the possibility of global
          synchronization where retransmission burst become synchronized
          across the whole network, and improves fairness among
          different TCP sessions.  However, RED by itself cannot prevent
          congestion and unfairness caused by sources unresponsive to
          RED, e.g., UDP traffic and some misbehaved greedy connections.
          Other schemes have been proposed to improve the performance
          and fairness in the presence of unresponsive traffic.  Some of
          those schemes (such as Longest Queue Drop (LQD) and Dynamic
          Soft Partitioning with Random Drop (RND) [SLDC98]) were
          proposed as theoretical frameworks and are typically not
          available in existing commercial products.

   2.  Congestion Management: Reactive Versus Preventive Schemes

       *  Reactive: Reactive (recovery) congestion management policies
          react to existing congestion problems.  All the policies
          described above for the long and medium time scales can be
          categorized as being reactive.  They are based on monitoring
          and identifying congestion problems that exist in the network,
          and on the initiation of relevant actions to ease a situation.

       *  Preventive: Preventive (predictive/avoidance) policies take
          proactive action to prevent congestion based on estimates and
          predictions of future congestion problems.  Some of the
          policies described for the long and medium time scales fall



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


          into this category.  Preventive policies do not necessarily
          respond immediately to existing congestion problems.  Instead,
          forecasts of traffic demand and workload distribution are
          considered, and action may be taken to prevent potential
          future congestion problems.  The schemes described for the
          short time scale can also be used for congestion avoidance
          because dropping or marking packets before queues actually
          overflow would trigger corresponding TCP sources to slow down.

   3.  Congestion Management: Supply-Side Versus Demand-Side Schemes

       *  Supply-side: Supply-side congestion management policies
          increase the effective capacity available to traffic in order
          to control or reduce congestion.  This can be accomplished by
          increasing capacity or by balancing distribution of traffic
          over the network.  Capacity planning aims to provide a
          physical topology and associated link bandwidths that match or
          exceed estimated traffic workload and traffic distribution
          subject to traffic forecasts and budgetary or other
          constraints.  If the actual traffic distribution does not fit
          the topology derived from capacity panning, then the traffic
          can be mapped onto the topology by using routing control
          mechanisms, by applying path oriented technologies (e.g., MPLS
          LSPs and optical channel trails) to modify the logical
          topology, or by employing some other load redistribution
          mechanisms.

       *  Demand-side: Demand-side congestion management policies
          control or regulate the offered traffic to alleviate
          congestion problems.  For example, some of the short time
          scale mechanisms described earlier as well as policing and
          rate-shaping mechanisms attempt to regulate the offered load
          in various ways.

2.5.  Implementation and Operational Context

   The operational context of Internet traffic engineering is
   characterized by constant changes that occur at multiple levels of
   abstraction.  The implementation context demands effective planning,
   organization, and execution.  The planning aspects may involve
   determining prior sets of actions to achieve desired objectives.
   Organizing involves arranging and assigning responsibility to the
   various components of the traffic engineering system and coordinating
   the activities to accomplish the desired TE objectives.  Execution
   involves measuring and applying corrective or perfective actions to
   attain and maintain desired TE goals.

3.  Traffic Engineering Process Models

   This section describes a generic process model that captures the
   high-level practical aspects of Internet traffic engineering in an
   operational context.  The process model is described as a sequence of
   actions that must be carried out to optimize the performance of an
   operational network (see also [RFC2702], [AWD2]).  This process model
   may be enacted explicitly or implicitly, by a software process or by
   a human.

   The traffic engineering process model is iterative [AWD2].  The four
   phases of the process model described below are repeated as a
   continual sequence.

   o  Define the relevant control policies that govern the operation of
      the network.

   o  Acquire measurement data from the operational network.

   o  Analyze the network state and characterize the traffic workload.
      Proactive analysis identifies potential problems that could
      manifest in the future.  Reactive analysis identifies existing
      problems and determines their causes.

   o  Optimizate the performance of the network.  This involves a
      decision process which selects and implements a set of actions
      from a set of alternatives given the results of the three previous
      steps.  Optimization actions may include the use of techniques to
      control the offered traffic and to control the distribution of
      traffic across the network.

3.1.  Components of the Traffic Engineering Process Model

   The key components of the traffic engineering process model are as
   follows.

   1.  Measurement is crucial to the traffic engineering function.  The
       operational state of a network can only be conclusively
       determined through measurement.  Measurement is also critical to
       the optimization function because it provides feedback data which
       is used by traffic engineering control subsystems.  This data is
       used to adaptively optimize network performance in response to
       events and stimuli originating within and outside the network.
       Measurement in support of the TE function can occur at different
       levels of abstraction.  For example, measurement can be used to
       derive packet level characteristics, flow level characteristics,
       user or customer level characteristics, traffic aggregate

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


       characteristics, component level characteristics, and network
       wide characteristics.

   2.  Modeling, analysis, and simulation are important aspects of
       Internet traffic engineering.  Modeling involves constructing an
       abstract or physical representation which depicts relevant
       traffic characteristics and network attributes.  A network model
       is an abstract representation of the network which captures
       relevant network features, attributes, and characteristic.
       Network simulation tools are extremely useful for traffic
       engineering.  Because of the complexity of realistic quantitative
       analysis of network behavior, certain aspects of network
       performance studies can only be conducted effectively using
       simulation.

   3.  Network performance optimization involves resolving network
       issues by transforming such issues into concepts that enable a
       solution, identification of a solution, and implementation of the
       solution.  Network performance optimization can be corrective or
       perfective.  In corrective optimization, the goal is to remedy a
       problem that has occurred or that is incipient.  In perfective
       optimization, the goal is to improve network performance even
       when explicit problems do not exist and are not anticipated.

4.  Review of TE Techniques

   This section briefly reviews different traffic engineering approaches
   proposed and implemented in telecommunications and computer networks
   using IETF protocols and architectures.  The discussion is not
   intended to be comprehensive.  It is primarily intended to illuminate
   existing approaches to traffic engineering in the Internet.  A
   historic overview of traffic engineering in telecommunications
   networks is provided in Appendix A, while Appendix B describes
   approaches in other standards bodies.

4.1.  Overview of IETF Projects Related to Traffic Engineering

   This subsection reviews a number of IETF activities pertinent to
   Internet traffic engineering.

4.1.1.  Constraint-Based Routing

   Constraint-based routing refers to a class of routing systems that
   compute routes through a network subject to the satisfaction of a set
   of constraints and requirements.  In the most general case,
   constraint-based routing may also seek to optimize overall network
   performance while minimizing costs.




Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 22]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   The constraints and requirements may be imposed by the network itself
   or by administrative policies.  Constraints may include bandwidth,
   hop count, delay, and policy instruments such as resource class
   attributes.  Constraints may also include domain specific attributes
   of certain network technologies and contexts which impose
   restrictions on the solution space of the routing function.  Path
   oriented technologies such as MPLS have made constraint-based routing
   feasible and attractive in public IP networks.

   The concept of constraint-based routing within the context of MPLS
   traffic engineering requirements in IP networks was first described
   in [RFC2702] and led to developments such as MPLS-TE [RFC3209] as
   described in Section 4.1.6.

   Unlike QoS routing (for example, see [RFC2386] and [MA]) which
   generally addresses the issue of routing individual traffic flows to
   satisfy prescribed flow-based QoS requirements subject to network
   resource availability, constraint-based routing is applicable to
   traffic aggregates as well as flows and may be subject to a wide
   variety of constraints which may include policy restrictions.

4.1.2.  Integrated Services

   The IETF developed the Integrated Services (Intserv) model that
   requires resources, such as bandwidth and buffers, to be reserved a
   priori for a given traffic flow to ensure that the quality of service
   requested by the traffic flow is satisfied.  The Integrated Services
   model includes additional components beyond those used in the best-
   effort model such as packet classifiers, packet schedulers, and
   admission control.  A packet classifier is used to identify flows
   that are to receive a certain level of service.  A packet scheduler
   handles the scheduling of service to different packet flows to ensure
   that QoS commitments are met.  Admission control is used to determine
   whether a router has the necessary resources to accept a new flow.

   The main issue with the Integrated Services model has been
   scalability [RFC2998], especially in large public IP networks which
   may potentially have millions of active micro-flows in transit
   concurrently.

   A notable feature of the Integrated Services model is that it
   requires explicit signaling of QoS requirements from end systems to
   routers [RFC2753].  The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) performs
   this signaling function and is a critical component of the Integrated
   Services model.  RSVP is described in Section 4.1.3.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


4.1.3.  RSVP

   RSVP is a soft state signaling protocol [RFC2205].  It supports
   receiver initiated establishment of resource reservations for both
   multicast and unicast flows.  RSVP was originally developed as a
   signaling protocol within the Integrated Services framework (see
   Section 4.1.2) for applications to communicate QoS requirements to
   the network and for the network to reserve relevant resources to
   satisfy the QoS requirements [RFC2205].

   In RSVP, the traffic sender or source node sends a PATH message to
   the traffic receiver with the same source and destination addresses
   as the traffic which the sender will generate.  The PATH message
   contains: (1) a sender traffic specification describing the
   characteristics of the traffic, (2) a sender template specifying the
   format of the traffic, and (3) an optional advertisement
   specification which is used to support the concept of One Pass With
   Advertising (OPWA) [RFC2205].  Every intermediate router along the
   path forwards the PATH message to the next hop determined by the
   routing protocol.  Upon receiving a PATH message, the receiver
   responds with a RESV message which includes a flow descriptor used to
   request resource reservations.  The RESV message travels to the
   sender or source node in the opposite direction along the path that
   the PATH message traversed.  Every intermediate router along the path
   can reject or accept the reservation request of the RESV message.  If
   the request is rejected, the rejecting router will send an error
   message to the receiver and the signaling process will terminate.  If
   the request is accepted, link bandwidth and buffer space are
   allocated for the flow and the related flow state information is
   installed in the router.

   One of the issues with the original RSVP specification was
   Scalability.  This is because reservations were required for micro-
   flows, so that the amount of state maintained by network elements
   tends to increase linearly with the number of micro-flows.  These
   issues are described in [RFC2961] which also modifies and extendeds
   RSVP to mitigate the scaling problems to make RSVP a versatile
   signaling protocol for the Internet.  For example, RSVP has been
   extended to reserve resources for aggregation of flows, to set up
   MPLS explicit label switched paths (see Section 4.1.6), and to
   perform other signaling functions within the Internet.  [RFC2961]
   also describes a mechanism to reduce the amount of Refresh messages
   required to maintain established RSVP sessions.

4.1.4.  Differentiated Services

   The goal of Differentiated Services (Diffserv) within the IETF was to
   devise scalable mechanisms for categorization of traffic into
   behavior aggregates, which ultimately allows each behavior aggregate
   to be treated differently, especially when there is a shortage of
   resources such as link bandwidth and buffer space [RFC2475].  One of
   the primary motivations for Diffserv was to devise alternative
   mechanisms for service differentiation in the Internet that mitigate
   the scalability issues encountered with the Intserv model.

   Diffserv uses the Differentiated Services field in the IP header (the
   DS field) consisting of six bits in what was formerly known as the
   Type of Service (TOS) octet.  The DS field is used to indicate the
   forwarding treatment that a packet should receive at a transit node
   [RFC2474].  Diffserv includes the concept of Per-Hop Behavior (PHB)
   groups.  Using the PHBs, several classes of services can be defined
   using different classification, policing, shaping, and scheduling
   rules.

   For an end-user of network services to utilize Differentiated
   Services provided by its Internet Service Provider (ISP), it may be
   necessary for the user to have an SLA with the ISP.  An SLA may
   explicitly or implicitly specify a Traffic Conditioning Agreement
   (TCA) which defines classifier rules as well as metering, marking,
   discarding, and shaping rules.

   Packets are classified, and possibly policed and shaped at the
   ingress to a Diffserv network.  When a packet traverses the boundary
   between different Diffserv domains, the DS field of the packet may be
   re-marked according to existing agreements between the domains.

   Differentiated Services allows only a finite number of service
   classes to be specified by the DS field.  The main advantage of the
   Diffserv approach relative to the Intserv model is scalability.
   Resources are allocated on a per-class basis and the amount of state
   information is proportional to the number of classes rather than to
   the number of application flows.

   The Diffserv model deals with traffic management issues on a per hop
   basis.  The Diffserv control model consists of a collection of micro-
   TE control mechanisms.  Other traffic engineering capabilities, such
   as capacity management (including routing control), are also required
   in order to deliver acceptable service quality in Diffserv networks.
   The concept of Per Domain Behaviors has been introduced to better
   capture the notion of Differentiated Services across a complete
   domain [RFC3086].

4.1.5.  QUIC

   TBD

4.1.6.  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

   MPLS is an advanced forwarding scheme which also includes extensions
   to conventional IP control plane protocols.  MPLS extends the
   Internet routing model and enhances packet forwarding and path
   control [RFC3031].

   At the ingress to an MPLS domain, Label Switching Routers (LSRs)
   classify IP packets into Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) based
   on a variety of factors, including, e.g., a combination of the
   information carried in the IP header of the packets and the local
   routing information maintained by the LSRs.  An MPLS label stack
   entry is then prepended to each packet according to their forwarding
   equivalence classes.  The MPLS label stack entry is 32 bits long and
   contains a 20-bit label field.

   An LSR makes forwarding decisions by using the label prepended to
   packets as the index into a local next hop label forwarding entry
   (NHLFE).  The packet is then processed as specified in the NHLFE.
   The incoming label may be replaced by an outgoing label (label swap),
   and the packet may be forwarded to the next LSR.  Before a packet
   leaves an MPLS domain, its MPLS label may be removed (label pop).  A
   Label Switched Path (LSP) is the path between an ingress LSRs and an
   egress LSRs through which a labeled packet traverses.  The path of an
   explicit LSP is defined at the originating (ingress) node of the LSP.
   MPLS can use a signaling protocol such as RSVP or LDP to set up LSPs.

   MPLS is a very powerful technology for Internet traffic engineering
   because it supports explicit LSPs which allow constraint-based
   routing to be implemented efficiently in IP networks [AWD2].  The
   requirements for traffic engineering over MPLS are described in
   [RFC2702].  Extensions to RSVP to support instantiation of explicit
   LSP are discussed in [RFC3209].

4.1.7.  Generalized MPLS

   GMPLS extends MPLS control protocols to encompass time-division
   (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, G.709), wavelength (lambdas), and spatial
   switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber) as
   well as continuing to support packet switching.  GMPLS provides a
   common set of control protocols for all of these layers (including
   some technology-specific extensions) each of which has a diverse data
   or forwarding plane.  GMPLS covers both the signaling and the routing




Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 26]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   part of that control plane and is based on the Traffic Engineering
   extensions to MPLS (see Section 4.1.6).

   In GMPLS, the original MPLS architecture is extended to include LSRs
   whose forwarding planes rely on circuit switching, and therefore
   cannot forward data based on the information carried in either packet
   or cell headers.  Specifically, such LSRs include devices where the
   switching is based on time slots, wavelengths, or physical ports.
   These additions impact basic LSP properties: how labels are requested
   and communicated, the unidirectional nature of MPLS LSPs, how errors
   are propagated, and information provided for synchronizing the
   ingress and egress LSRs.

4.1.8.  IP Performance Metrics

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has developed a
   set of standard metrics that can be used to monitor the quality,
   performance, and reliability of Internet services.  These metrics can
   be applied by network operators, end-users, and independent testing
   groups to provide users and service providers with a common
   understanding of the performance and reliability of the Internet
   component 'clouds' they use/provide [RFC2330].  The criteria for
   performance metrics developed by the IPPM working group are described
   in [RFC2330].  Examples of performance metrics include one-way packet
   loss [RFC7680], one-way delay [RFC7679], and connectivity measures
   between two nodes [RFC2678].  Other metrics include second-order
   measures of packet loss and delay.

   Some of the performance metrics specified by the IPPM working group
   are useful for specifying SLAs.  SLAs are sets of service level
   objectives negotiated between users and service providers, wherein
   each objective is a combination of one or more performance metrics,
   possibly subject to certain constraints.

4.1.9.  Flow Measurement

   The IETF Real Time Flow Measurement (RTFM) working group produced an
   architecture that defines a method to specify traffic flows as well
   as a number of components for flow measurement (meters, meter
   readers, manager) [RFC2722].  A flow measurement system enables
   network traffic flows to be measured and analyzed at the flow level
   for a variety of purposes.  As noted in RFC 2722, a flow measurement
   system can be very useful in the following contexts:

   o  understanding the behavior of existing networks

   o  planning for network development and expansion




Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 27]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   o  quantification of network performance

   o  verifying the quality of network service

   o  attribution of network usage to users.

   A flow measurement system consists of meters, meter readers, and
   managers.  A meter observes packets passing through a measurement
   point, classifies them into groups, accumulates usage data (such as
   the number of packets and bytes for each group), and stores the usage
   data in a flow table.  A group may represent any collection of user
   applications, hosts, networks, etc.  A meter reader gathers usage
   data from various meters so it can be made available for analysis.  A
   manager is responsible for configuring and controlling meters and
   meter readers.  The instructions received by a meter from a manager
   include flow specifications, meter control parameters, and sampling
   techniques.  The instructions received by a meter reader from a
   manager include the address of the meter whose date is to be
   collected, the frequency of data collection, and the types of flows
   to be collected.

4.1.10.  Endpoint Congestion Management

   [RFC3124] provides a set of congestion control mechanisms for the use
   of transport protocols.  It is also allows the development of
   mechanisms for unifying congestion control across a subset of an
   endpoint's active unicast connections (called a congestion group).  A
   congestion manager continuously monitors the state of the path for
   each congestion group under its control.  The manager uses that
   information to instruct a scheduler on how to partition bandwidth
   among the connections of that congestion group.

4.1.11.  TE Extensions to the IGPs

   TBD : Boris Hassanov

4.1.12.  Link-State BGP

   In a number of environments, a component external to a network is
   called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and
   current state of the connections within the network, including
   traffic engineering information.  This is information typically
   distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network (see
   Section 4.1.11.

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Section 7 is one of the essential
   routing protocols that glue the Internet together.  BGP Link State
   (BGP-LS) [RFC7752] is a mechanism by which link-state and traffic

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   engineering information can be collected from networks and shared
   with external components using the BGP routing protocol.  The
   mechanism is applicable to physical and virtual IGP links, and is
   subject to policy control.

   Information collected by BGP-LS can be used to construct the Traffic
   Engineering Database (TED, see Section 4.1.19) for use by the Path
   Computation Element (PCE, see Section 4.1.13), or may be used by
   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers (see
   Section 4.1.14).

4.1.13.  Path Computation Element

   Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for
   traffic engineering in MPLS and GMPLS networks.  Path computation in
   large, multi-domain networks is complex and may require special
   computational components and cooperation between the elements in
   different domains.  The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] is
   an entity (component, application, or network node) that is capable
   of computing a network path or route based on a network graph and
   applying computational constraints.

   Thus, a PCE can provide a central component in a traffic engineering
   system operating on the Traffic Engineering Database (TED, see
   Section 4.1.19) with delegated responsibility for determining paths
   in MPLS, GMPLS, or Segment Routing networks.  The PCE uses the Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] to
   communicate with Path Computation Clients (PCCs), such as MPLS LSRs,
   to answer their requests for computed paths or to instruct them to
   initiate new paths [RFC8281] and maintain state about paths already
   installed in the network [RFC8231].

   PCEs form key components of a number of traffic engineering systems,
   such as the Application of the Path Computation Element Architecture
   [RFC6805], the Applicability of a Stateful Path Computation Element
   ([RFC8051]), Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN)
   (Section 4.1.16), Centralized Network Control [RFC8283], and Software
   Defined Networking (SDN) (Section 5.3.2).

4.1.15.  Segment Routing with MPLS encapsuation (SR-MPLS)

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling
   paradigms.  The path a packet takes is defined at the ingress and the
   packet is tunneled to the egress.  A node steers a packet through a



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending the
   packet with an SR header: a label stack in MPLS case.

   A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-
   based, thanks to the MPLS architecture [RFC3031].  Labels can be
   looked up in a global context (platform wide) as well as in some
   other context (see "context labels" in Section 3 of [RFC5331]).

4.1.15.1.  Base Segment Routing Identifier Types

   Segments are identified by Segment Identifiers (SIDs).  There are
   four types of SID that are relevant for traffic engineering.

   Prefix SID:  Uses the SR Global Block (SRGB), must be unique within
      the routing domain SRGB, and is advertised by an IGP.  The Prefix-
      SID can be configured as an absolute value or an index.

   Node SID:  A Prefix SID with the 'N' (node) bit set.  It is
      associated with a host prefix (/32 or /128) that identifies the
      node.  More than 1 Node SID can be configured per node.

   Adjacency SID:  Locally significant by default, an Adjacency SID can
      be made globally significant through use of the 'L' flag.  It
      identifies a unidirectional adjacency.  In most implementations
      Adjacency SIDs are automatically allocated for each adjacency.
      They are always encoded as an absolute (not indexed) value.

   Binding SID:  A Binding SID has two purposes:

      1.  Mapping Server in ISIS

             The SID/Label Binding TLV is used to advertise the mappings
             of prefixes to SIDs/Labels.  This functionality is called
             the Segment Routing Mapping Server (SRMS).  The behavior of
             the SRMS is defined in [RFC8661]

      2.  Cross-connect (label to FEC mapping)

             This is fundamental for multi-domain/multi-layer operation.
             The Binding SID identifies a new path available at the
             anchor point.  It is always local to the originator, must
             not be present at the top of the stack, and must be looked
             up in the context of the Node SID.  It could be provisioned
             through Netconf/Restconf, PCEP, BGP, or the CLI.

4.1.16.  Network Virtualization and Abstraction

   One of the main drivers for Software Defined Networking (SDN)
   [RFC7149] is a decoupling of the network control plane from the data
   plane.  This separation has been achieved for TE networks with the
   development of MPLS/GMPLS (see Section 4.1.6 and Section 4.1.7) and
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) (Section 4.1.13).  One of the
   advantages of SDN is its logically centralized control regime that
   allows a global view of the underlying networks.  Centralized control
   in SDN helps improve network resource utilization compared with
   distributed network control.

   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) [RFC8453] defines a
   hierarchical SDN architecture which describes the functional entities
   and methods for the coordination of resources across multiple
   domains, to provide end-to-end traffic engineered services.  ACTN
   facilitates end-to-end connections and provides them to the user.
   ACTN is focused on:

   o  Abstraction of the underlying network resources and how they are
      provided to higher-layer applications and customers.

   o  Virtualization of underlying resources for use by the customer,
      application, or service.  The creation of a virtualized
      environment allows operators to view and control multi-domain
      networks as a single virtualized network.

   o  Presentation to customers of networks as a virtual network via
      open and programmable interfaces.

   The ACTN managed infrastructure is built from traffic engineered
   network resources, which may include statistical packet bandwidth,
   physical forwarding plane sources (such as wavelengths and time
   slots), forwarding and cross-connect capabilities.  The type of
   network virtualization seen in ACTN allows customers and applications
   (tenants) to utilise and independently control allocated virtual
   network resources as if resources as if they were physically their
   own resource.  The ACTN network is "sliced", with tenants being given
   a different partial and abstracted topology view of the physical
   underlying network.

4.1.18.  Deterministic Networking

   TBD

4.1.19.  Network TE State Definition and Presentation

   The network states that are relevant to the traffic engineering need
   to be stored in the system and presented to the user.  The Traffic
   Engineering Database (TED) is a collection of all TE information
   about all TE nodes and TE links in the network, which is an essential
   component of a TE system, such as MPLS-TE [RFC2702] and GMPLS
   [RFC3945].  In order to formally define the data in the TED and to
   present the data to the user with high usability, the data modeling
   language YANG [RFC7950] can be used as described in [RFC8795].

4.1.20.  System Management and Control Interfaces

   The traffic engineering control system needs to have a management
   interface that is human-friendly and a control interfaces that is
   programable for automation.  The Network Configuration Protocol
   (NETCONF) [RFC6241] or the RESTCONF Protocol [RFC8040] provide
   programmable interfaces that are also human-friendly.  These
   protocols use XML or JSON encoded messages.  When message compactness
   or protocol bandwidth consumption needs to be optimized for the
   control interface, other protocols, such as Group Communication for
   the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7390] or gRPC, are
   available, especially when the protocol messages are encoded in a
   binary format.  Along with any of these protocols, the data modeling
   language YANG [RFC7950] can be used to formally and precisely define
   the interface data.

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440]
   is another protocol that has evolved to be an option for the TE
   system control interface.  The messages of PCEP are TLV-based, not
   defined by a data modeling language such as YANG.

4.2.  Content Distribution

   The Internet is dominated by client-server interactions, principally
   Web traffic although in the future, more sophisticated media servers
   may become dominant.  The location and performance of major
   information servers has a significant impact on the traffic patterns
   within the Internet as well as on the perception of service quality
   by end users.

   A number of dynamic load balancing techniques have been devised to
   improve the performance of replicated information servers.  These
   techniques can cause spatial traffic characteristics to become more

   dynamic in the Internet because information servers can be
   dynamically picked based upon the location of the clients, the
   location of the servers, the relative utilization of the servers, the
   relative performance of different networks, and the relative
   performance of different parts of a network.  This process of
   assignment of distributed servers to clients is called traffic
   directing.  It is an application layer function.

   Traffic directing schemes that allocate servers in multiple
   geographically dispersed locations to clients may require empirical
   network performance statistics to make more effective decisions.  In
   the future, network measurement systems may need to provide this type
   of information.

   When congestion exists in the network, traffic directing and traffic
   engineering systems should act in a coordinated manner.  This topic
   is for further study.

   The issues related to location and replication of information
   servers, particularly web servers, are important for Internet traffic
   engineering because these servers contribute a substantial proportion
   of Internet traffic.

5.1.  Time-Dependent Versus State-Dependent Versus Event Dependent

   Traffic engineering methodologies can be classified as time-
   dependent, state-dependent, or event-dependent.  All TE schemes are
   considered to be dynamic in this document.  Static TE implies that no
   traffic engineering methodology or algorithm is being applied - it is
   a feature of network planning, but lacks the reactive and flexible
   nature of traffic engineering.

   In time-dependent TE, historical information based on periodic
   variations in traffic (such as time of day) is used to pre-program
   routing and other TE control mechanisms.  Additionally, customer
   subscription or traffic projection may be used.  Pre-programmed
   routing plans typically change on a relatively long time scale (e.g.,
   daily).  Time-dependent algorithms do not attempt to adapt to short-
   term variations in traffic or changing network conditions.  An
   example of a time-dependent algorithm is a global centralized
   optimizer where the input to the system is a traffic matrix and
   multi-class QoS requirements as described [MR99].  Another example of
   such a methodology is the application of data mining to Internet
   traffic [AJ19] which enables the use of various machine learning
   algorithms to identify patterns within historically collected
   datasets about Internet traffic, and to extract information in order
   to guide decision-making, and to improve efficiency and productivity
   of operational processes.

   State-dependent TE adapts the routing plans based on the current
   state of the network which provides additional information on
   variations in actual traffic (i.e., perturbations from regular
   variations) that could not be predicted using historical information.
   Constraint-based routing is an example of state-dependent TE
   operating in a relatively long time scale.  An example operating in a
   relatively short timescale is a load-balancing algorithm described in
   [MATE].  The state of the network can be based on parameters such as
   utilization, packet delay, and packet loss that can be advertized or
   flooded by the routers.  Another approach is for a particular router
   performing adaptive TE to send probe packets along a path to gather
   the state of that path.  [RFC6374] defines protocol extensions to
   collect performance measurements from MPLS networks.  Another
   approach is for a management system to gather the relevant
   information directly from network elements using telemetry data
   collection "publication/subscription" techniques [RFC7923].  Timely
   gathering and distribution of state information is critical for
   adaptive TE.  While time-dependent algorithms are suitable for
   predictable traffic variations, state-dependent algorithms may be
   applied to increase network efficiency and resilience to adapt to the
   prevailing network state.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Event-dependent TE methods can also be used for TE path selection.
   Event-dependent TE methods are distinct from time-dependent and
   state-dependent TE methods in the manner in which paths are selected.
   These algorithms are adaptive and distributed in nature and typically
   use learning models to find good paths for TE in a network.  While
   state-dependent TE models typically use available-link-bandwidth
   (ALB) flooding for TE path selection, event-dependent TE methods do
   not require ALB flooding.  Rather, event-dependent TE methods
   typically search out capacity by learning models, as in the success-
   to-the-top (STT) method.  ALB flooding can be resource intensive,
   since it requires link bandwidth to carry LSAs, processor capacity to
   process LSAs, and the overhead can limit area/Autonomous System (AS)
   size.  Modeling results suggest that event-dependent TE methods could
   lead to a reduction in ALB flooding overhead without loss of network
   throughput performance [I-D.ietf-tewg-qos-routing].

5.2.  Offline Versus Online

   Traffic engineering requires the computation of routing plans.  The
   computation may be performed offline or online.  The computation can
   be done offline for scenarios where routing plans need not be
   executed in real-time.  For example, routing plans computed from
   forecast information may be computed offline.  Typically, offline
   computation is also used to perform extensive searches on multi-
   dimensional solution spaces.

   Online computation is required when the routing plans must adapt to
   changing network conditions as in state-dependent algorithms.  Unlike
   offline computation (which can be computationally demanding), online
   computation is geared toward relative simple and fast calculations to
   select routes, fine-tune the allocations of resources, and perform
   load balancing.

5.3.  Centralized Versus Distributed

   Centralized control has a central authority which determines routing
   plans and perhaps other TE control parameters on behalf of each
   router.  The central authority collects the network-state information
   from all routers periodically and returns the routing information to
   the routers.  The routing update cycle is a critical parameter
   directly impacting the performance of the network being controlled.
   Centralized control may need high processing power and high bandwidth
   control channels.

   Distributed control determines route selection by each router
   autonomously based on the routers view of the state of the network.
   The network state information may be obtained by the router using a
   probing method or distributed by other routers on a periodic basis

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   using link state advertisements.  Network state information may also
   be disseminated under exceptional conditions.  Examples of protocol
   extensions used to advertise network link state information are
   defined in [RFC5305], [RFC6119], [RFC7471], [RFC8570], and [RFC8571].

5.3.1.  Hybrid Systems

   TBD

5.3.2.  Considerations for Software Defined Networking

   As discussed in Section 4.1.16, one of the main drivers for SDN is a
   decoupling of the network control plane from the data plane
   [RFC7149].  However, SDN may also combine centralized control of
   resources, and facilitating application-to-network interaction via a
   well-defined application programming interface (API) such as
   [RFC8040].  Combining these components would provide a flexible
   network architecture that can adapt to network requirements for a
   variety of higher-layer applications, a concept often referred to as
   the "programmable network" [RFC7426].

   The centralized control aspect of SDN helps improve global network
   resource utilization compared with distributed network control, where
   local policy may often override global optimization goals.  In an SDN
   environment, the data plane forwards traffic to its desired
   destination.  However, before traffic reaches the data plane, the
   logically centralized SDN control plane often determines the end-to-
   end path the application traffic will take in the network.
   Therefore, the SDN control plane needs to be aware of the underlying
   network topology, capabilities and current node and link resource
   state.

   Using a PCE-based SDN control framework [RFC7491], the available
   network topology may be discovered by running a passive instance of
   OSPF or IS-IS, or via BGP-LS [RFC7752], to generate a TED (see
   Section 4.1.19).  The PCE is used to compute a path (see
   Section 4.1.13) based on the TED and available bandwidth, and further
   path optimization may be based on requested objective functions
   [RFC5541].  When a suitable path has been computed the programming of
   the explicit network path may be performed using either end-to-end
   signaling protocol [RFC3209] or per-hop with each node being directly
   programmed [RFC8283] by the SDN controller.

   By utilizing a centralized approach to network control, additional
   network benefits are also available, including Global Concurrent
   Optimization (GCO) [RFC5557].  A GCO path computation request will
   simultaneously use the network topology and set of new end-to-end
   path requests, along with their respective constraints, for optimal

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   placement in the network.  Correspondingly, a GCO-based computation
   may be applied to recompute existing network paths to groom traffic
   and to mitigate congestion.

5.4.  Local Versus Global

   Traffic engineering algorithms may require local or global network-
   state information.

   Local information pertains to the state of a portion of the domain.
   Examples include the bandwidth and packet loss rate of a particular
   path.  Local state information may be sufficient for certain
   instances of distributed-controlled TEs.

   Global information pertains to the state of the entire domain
   undergoing traffic engineering.  Examples include a global traffic
   matrix and loading information on each link throughout the domain of
   interest.  Global state information is typically required with
   centralized control.  Distributed TE systems may also need global
   information in some cases.

5.5.  Prescriptive Versus Descriptive

   TE systems may also be classified as prescriptive or descriptive.

   Prescriptive traffic engineering evaluates alternatives and
   recommends a course of action.  Prescriptive traffic engineering can
   be further categorized as either corrective or perfective.
   Corrective TE prescribes a course of action to address an existing or
   predicted anomaly.  Perfective TE prescribes a course of action to
   evolve and improve network performance even when no anomalies are
   evident.

   Descriptive traffic engineering, on the other hand, characterizes the
   state of the network and assesses the impact of various policies
   without recommending any particular course of action.

5.5.1.  Intent-Based Networking

   TBD : Jeff Tantsura

5.6.  Open-Loop Versus Closed-Loop

   Open-loop traffic engineering control is where control action does
   not use feedback information from the current network state.  The
   control action may use its own local information for accounting
   purposes, however.




Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 37]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Closed-loop traffic engineering control is where control action
   utilizes feedback information from the network state.  The feedback
   information may be in the form of historical information or current
   measurement.

5.7.  Tactical versus Strategic

   Tactical traffic engineering aims to address specific performance
   problems (such as hot-spots) that occur in the network from a
   tactical perspective, without consideration of overall strategic
   imperatives.  Without proper planning and insights, tactical TE tends
   to be ad hoc in nature.

   Strategic traffic engineering approaches the TE problem from a more
   organized and systematic perspective, taking into consideration the
   immediate and longer term consequences of specific policies and
   actions.

6.  Recommendations for Internet Traffic Engineering

   This section describes high-level recommendations for traffic
   engineering in the Internet.  These recommendations are presented in
   general terms.

   The recommendations describe the capabilities needed to solve a
   traffic engineering problem or to achieve a traffic engineering
   objective.  Broadly speaking, these recommendations can be
   categorized as either functional or non-functional recommendations.

   Functional recommendations for Internet traffic engineering describe
   the functions that a traffic engineering system should perform.
   These functions are needed to realize traffic engineering objectives
   by addressing traffic engineering problems.

   Non-functional recommendations for Internet traffic engineering
   relate to the quality attributes or state characteristics of a
   traffic engineering system.  These recommendations may contain
   conflicting assertions and may sometimes be difficult to quantify
   precisely.

6.1.  Generic Non-functional Recommendations

   The generic non-functional recommendations for Internet traffic
   engineering include: usability, automation, scalability, stability,
   visibility, simplicity, efficiency, reliability, correctness,
   maintainability, extensibility, interoperability, and security.  In a
   given context, some of these recommendations may be critical while
   others may be optional.  Therefore, prioritization may be required



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 38]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   during the development phase of a traffic engineering system (or
   components thereof) to tailor it to a specific operational context.

   In the following paragraphs, some of the aspects of the non-
   functional recommendations for Internet traffic engineering are
   summarized.

   Usability: Usability is a human factor aspect of traffic engineering
   systems.  Usability refers to the ease with which a traffic
   engineering system can be deployed and operated.  In general, it is
   desirable to have a TE system that can be readily deployed in an
   existing network.  It is also desirable to have a TE system that is
   easy to operate and maintain.

   Automation: Whenever feasible, a traffic engineering system should
   automate as many traffic engineering functions as possible to
   minimize the amount of human effort needed to control and analyze
   operational networks.  Automation is particularly imperative in large
   scale public networks because of the high cost of the human aspects
   of network operations and the high risk of network problems caused by
   human errors.  Automation may entail the incorporation of automatic
   feedback and intelligence into some components of the traffic
   engineering system.

   Scalability: Contemporary public networks are growing very fast with
   respect to network size and traffic volume.  Therefore, a TE system
   should be scalable to remain applicable as the network evolves.  In
   particular, a TE system should remain functional as the network
   expands with regard to the number of routers and links, and with
   respect to the traffic volume.  A TE system should have a scalable
   architecture, should not adversely impair other functions and
   processes in a network element, and should not consume too much
   network resources when collecting and distributing state information
   or when exerting control.

   Stability: Stability is a very important consideration in traffic
   engineering systems that respond to changes in the state of the
   network.  State-dependent traffic engineering methodologies typically
   mandate a tradeoff between responsiveness and stability.  It is
   strongly recommended that when tradeoffs are warranted between
   responsiveness and stability, that the tradeoff should be made in
   favor of stability (especially in public IP backbone networks).

   Flexibility: A TE system should be flexible to allow for changes in
   optimization policy.  In particular, a TE system should provide
   sufficient configuration options so that a network administrator can
   tailor the TE system to a particular environment.  It may also be
   desirable to have both online and offline TE subsystems which can be



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 39]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   independently enabled and disabled.  TE systems that are used in
   multi-class networks should also have options to support class based
   performance evaluation and optimization.

   Visibility: As part of the TE system, mechanisms should exist to
   collect statistics from the network and to analyze these statistics
   to determine how well the network is functioning.  Derived statistics
   such as traffic matrices, link utilization, latency, packet loss, and
   other performance measures of interest which are determined from
   network measurements can be used as indicators of prevailing network
   conditions.  Other examples of status information which should be
   observed include existing functional routing information
   (additionally, in the context of MPLS existing LSP routes), etc.

   Simplicity: Generally, a TE system should be as simple as possible.
   More importantly, the TE system should be relatively easy to use
   (i.e., clean, convenient, and intuitive user interfaces).  Simplicity
   in user interface does not necessarily imply that the TE system will
   use naive algorithms.  When complex algorithms and internal
   structures are used, such complexities should be hidden as much as
   possible from the network administrator through the user interface.

   Interoperability: Whenever feasible, traffic engineering systems and
   their components should be developed with open standards based
   interfaces to allow interoperation with other systems and components.

   Security: Security is a critical consideration in traffic engineering
   systems.  Such traffic engineering systems typically exert control
   over certain functional aspects of the network to achieve the desired
   performance objectives.  Therefore, adequate measures must be taken
   to safeguard the integrity of the traffic engineering system.
   Adequate measures must also be taken to protect the network from
   vulnerabilities that originate from security breaches and other
   impairments within the traffic engineering system.

   The remainder of this section will focus on some of the high-level
   functional recommendations for traffic engineering.

6.2.  Routing Recommendations

   Routing control is a significant aspect of Internet traffic
   engineering.  Routing impacts many of the key performance measures
   associated with networks, such as throughput, delay, and utilization.
   Generally, it is very difficult to provide good service quality in a
   wide area network without effective routing control.  A desirable
   routing system is one that takes traffic characteristics and network
   constraints into account during route selection while maintaining
   stability.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Traditional shortest path first (SPF) interior gateway protocols are
   based on shortest path algorithms and have limited control
   capabilities for traffic engineering [RFC2702], [AWD2].  These
   limitations include:

   1.  The well known issues with pure SPF protocols, which do not take
       network constraints and traffic characteristics into account
       during route selection.  For example, since IGPs always use the
       shortest paths (based on administratively assigned link metrics)
       to forward traffic, load sharing cannot be accomplished among
       paths of different costs.  Using shortest paths to forward
       traffic conserves network resources, but may cause the following
       problems: 1) If traffic from a source to a destination exceeds
       the capacity of a link along the shortest path, the link (hence
       the shortest path) becomes congested while a longer path between
       these two nodes may be under-utilized; 2) the shortest paths from
       different sources can overlap at some links.  If the total
       traffic from the sources exceeds the capacity of any of these
       links, congestion will occur.  Problems can also occur because
       traffic demand changes over time but network topology and routing
       configuration cannot be changed as rapidly.  This causes the
       network topology and routing configuration to become sub-optimal
       over time, which may result in persistent congestion problems.

   2.  The Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) capability of SPF IGPs supports
       sharing of traffic among equal cost paths between two nodes.
       However, ECMP attempts to divide the traffic as equally as
       possible among the equal cost shortest paths.  Generally, ECMP
       does not support configurable load sharing ratios among equal
       cost paths.  The result is that one of the paths may carry
       significantly more traffic than other paths because it may also
       carry traffic from other sources.  This situation can result in
       congestion along the path that carries more traffic.

   3.  Modifying IGP metrics to control traffic routing tends to have
       network-wide effect.  Consequently, undesirable and unanticipated
       traffic shifts can be triggered as a result.  Recent work
       described in Section 8 may be capable of better control [FT00],
       [FT01].

   Because of these limitations, new capabilities are needed to enhance
   the routing function in IP networks.  Some of these capabilities have
   been described elsewhere and are summarized below.

   Constraint-based routing is desirable to evolve the routing
   architecture of IP networks, especially public IP backbones with
   complex topologies [RFC2702].  Constraint-based routing computes
   routes to fulfill requirements subject to constraints.  Constraints



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 41]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   may include bandwidth, hop count, delay, and administrative policy
   instruments such as resource class attributes [RFC2702], [RFC2386].
   This makes it possible to select routes that satisfy a given set of
   requirements subject to network and administrative policy
   constraints.  Routes computed through constraint-based routing are
   not necessarily the shortest paths.  Constraint-based routing works
   best with path oriented technologies that support explicit routing,
   such as MPLS.

   Constraint-based routing can also be used as a way to redistribute
   traffic onto the infrastructure (even for best effort traffic).  For
   example, if the bandwidth requirements for path selection and
   reservable bandwidth attributes of network links are appropriately
   defined and configured, then congestion problems caused by uneven
   traffic distribution may be avoided or reduced.  In this way, the
   performance and efficiency of the network can be improved.

   A number of enhancements are needed to conventional link state IGPs,
   such as OSPF and IS-IS, to allow them to distribute additional state
   information required for constraint-based routing.  These extensions
   to OSPF were described in [RFC3630] and to IS-IS in [RFC5305].
   Essentially, these enhancements require the propagation of additional
   information in link state advertisements.  Specifically, in addition
   to normal link-state information, an enhanced IGP is required to
   propagate topology state information needed for constraint-based
   routing.  Some of the additional topology state information include
   link attributes such as reservable bandwidth and link resource class
   attribute (an administratively specified property of the link).  The
   resource class attribute concept was defined in [RFC2702].  The
   additional topology state information is carried in new TLVs and sub-
   TLVs in IS-IS, or in the Opaque LSA in OSPF [RFC5305], [RFC3630].

   An enhanced link-state IGP may flood information more frequently than
   a normal IGP.  This is because even without changes in topology,
   changes in reservable bandwidth or link affinity can trigger the
   enhanced IGP to initiate flooding.  A tradeoff is typically required
   between the timeliness of the information flooded and the flooding
   frequency to avoid excessive consumption of link bandwidth and
   computational resources, and more importantly, to avoid instability.

   In a TE system, it is also desirable for the routing subsystem to
   make the load splitting ratio among multiple paths (with equal cost
   or different cost) configurable.  This capability gives network
   administrators more flexibility in the control of traffic
   distribution across the network.  It can be very useful for avoiding/
   relieving congestion in certain situations.  Examples can be found in
   [XIAO].




Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 42]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   The routing system should also have the capability to control the
   routes of subsets of traffic without affecting the routes of other
   traffic if sufficient resources exist for this purpose.  This
   capability allows a more refined control over the distribution of
   traffic across the network.  For example, the ability to move traffic
   from a source to a destination away from its original path to another
   path (without affecting other traffic paths) allows traffic to be
   moved from resource-poor network segments to resource-rich segments.
   Path oriented technologies such as MPLS inherently support this
   capability as discussed in [AWD2].

   Additionally, the routing subsystem should be able to select
   different paths for different classes of traffic (or for different
   traffic behavior aggregates) if the network supports multiple classes
   of service (different behavior aggregates).

6.3.  Traffic Mapping Recommendations

   Traffic mapping pertains to the assignment of traffic workload onto
   pre-established paths to meet certain requirements.  Thus, while
   constraint-based routing deals with path selection, traffic mapping
   deals with the assignment of traffic to established paths which may
   have been selected by constraint-based routing or by some other
   means.  Traffic mapping can be performed by time-dependent or state-
   dependent mechanisms, as described in Section 5.1.

   An important aspect of the traffic mapping function is the ability to
   establish multiple paths between an originating node and a
   destination node, and the capability to distribute the traffic
   between the two nodes across the paths according to some policies.  A
   pre-condition for this scheme is the existence of flexible mechanisms
   to partition traffic and then assign the traffic partitions onto the
   parallel paths.  This requirement was noted in [RFC2702].  When
   traffic is assigned to multiple parallel paths, it is recommended
   that special care should be taken to ensure proper ordering of
   packets belonging to the same application (or micro-flow) at the
   destination node of the parallel paths.

   As a general rule, mechanisms that perform the traffic mapping
   functions should aim to map the traffic onto the network
   infrastructure to minimize congestion.  If the total traffic load
   cannot be accommodated, or if the routing and mapping functions
   cannot react fast enough to changing traffic conditions, then a
   traffic mapping system may rely on short time scale congestion
   control mechanisms (such as queue management, scheduling, etc.) to
   mitigate congestion.  Thus, mechanisms that perform the traffic
   mapping functions should complement existing congestion control
   mechanisms.  In an operational network, it is generally desirable to



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 43]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   map the traffic onto the infrastructure such that intra-class and
   inter-class resource contention are minimized.

   When traffic mapping techniques that depend on dynamic state feedback
   (e.g., MATE and such like) are used, special care must be taken to
   guarantee network stability.

6.4.  Measurement Recommendations

   The importance of measurement in traffic engineering has been
   discussed throughout this document.  Mechanisms should be provided to
   measure and collect statistics from the network to support the
   traffic engineering function.  Additional capabilities may be needed
   to help in the analysis of the statistics.  The actions of these
   mechanisms should not adversely affect the accuracy and integrity of
   the statistics collected.  The mechanisms for statistical data
   acquisition should also be able to scale as the network evolves.

   Traffic statistics may be classified according to long-term or short-
   term timescales.  Long-term timescale traffic statistics are very
   useful for traffic engineering.  Long-term time scale traffic
   statistics may capture or reflect periodicity in network workload
   (such as hourly, daily, and weekly variations in traffic profiles) as
   well as traffic trends.  Aspects of the monitored traffic statistics
   may also depict class of service characteristics for a network
   supporting multiple classes of service.  Analysis of the long-term
   traffic statistics may yield secondary statistics such as busy hour
   characteristics, traffic growth patterns, persistent congestion
   problems, hot-spot, and imbalances in link utilization caused by
   routing anomalies.

   A mechanism for constructing traffic matrices for both long-term and
   short-term traffic statistics should be in place.  In multi-service
   IP networks, the traffic matrices may be constructed for different
   service classes.  Each element of a traffic matrix represents a
   statistic of traffic flow between a pair of abstract nodes.  An
   abstract node may represent a router, a collection of routers, or a
   site in a VPN.

   Measured traffic statistics should provide reasonable and reliable
   indicators of the current state of the network on the short-term
   scale.  Some short term traffic statistics may reflect link
   utilization and link congestion status.  Examples of congestion
   indicators include excessive packet delay, packet loss, and high
   resource utilization.  Examples of mechanisms for distributing this
   kind of information include SNMP, probing techniques, FTP, IGP link
   state advertisements, etc.

6.5.  Network Survivability

   Network survivability refers to the capability of a network to
   maintain service continuity in the presence of faults.  This can be
   accomplished by promptly recovering from network impairments and
   maintaining the required QoS for existing services after recovery.
   Survivability has become an issue of great concern within the
   Internet community due to the increasing demands to carry mission
   critical traffic, real-time traffic, and other high priority traffic
   over the Internet.  Survivability can be addressed at the device
   level by developing network elements that are more reliable; and at
   the network level by incorporating redundancy into the architecture,
   design, and operation of networks.  It is recommended that a
   philosophy of robustness and survivability should be adopted in the
   architecture, design, and operation of traffic engineering that
   control IP networks (especially public IP networks).  Because
   different contexts may demand different levels of survivability, the
   mechanisms developed to support network survivability should be
   flexible so that they can be tailored to different needs.  A number
   of tools and techniques have been developed to enable network
   survivability including MPLS Fast Reroute [RFC4090], RSVP-TE
   Extensions in Support of End-to-End Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) Recovery [RFC4872], and GMPLS Segment Recovery
   [RFC4873].

   Failure protection and restoration capabilities have become available
   from multiple layers as network technologies have continued to
   improve.  At the bottom of the layered stack, optical networks are
   now capable of providing dynamic ring and mesh restoration
   functionality at the wavelength level as well as traditional
   protection functionality.  At the SONET/SDH layer survivability
   capability is provided with Automatic Protection Switching (APS) as
   well as self-healing ring and mesh architectures.  Similar
   functionality is provided by layer 2 technologies such as ATM
   (generally with slower mean restoration times).  Rerouting is
   traditionally used at the IP layer to restore service following link
   and node outages.  Rerouting at the IP layer occurs after a period of
   routing convergence which may require seconds to minutes to complete.
   Some new developments in the MPLS context make it possible to achieve
   recovery at the IP layer prior to convergence [RFC3469].

   To support advanced survivability requirements, path-oriented
   technologies such a MPLS can be used to enhance the survivability of
   IP networks in a potentially cost effective manner.  The advantages
   of path oriented technologies such as MPLS for IP restoration becomes
   even more evident when class based protection and restoration
   capabilities are required.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Recently, a common suite of control plane protocols has been proposed
   for both MPLS and optical transport networks under the acronym Multi-
   protocol Lambda Switching [AWD1].  This new paradigm of Multi-
   protocol Lambda Switching will support even more sophisticated mesh
   restoration capabilities at the optical layer for the emerging IP
   over WDM network architectures.

   Another important aspect regarding multi-layer survivability is that
   technologies at different layers provide protection and restoration
   capabilities at different temporal granularities (in terms of time
   scales) and at different bandwidth granularity (from packet-level to
   wavelength level).  Protection and restoration capabilities can also
   be sensitive to different service classes and different network
   utility models.

   The impact of service outages varies significantly for different
   service classes depending upon the effective duration of the outage.
   The duration of an outage can vary from milliseconds (with minor
   service impact) to seconds (with possible call drops for IP telephony
   and session time-outs for connection oriented transactions) to
   minutes and hours (with potentially considerable social and business
   impact).

   Coordinating different protection and restoration capabilities across
   multiple layers in a cohesive manner to ensure network survivability
   is maintained at reasonable cost is a challenging task.  Protection
   and restoration coordination across layers may not always be
   feasible, because networks at different layers may belong to
   different administrative domains.

   The following paragraphs present some of the general recommendations
   for protection and restoration coordination.

   o  Protection and restoration capabilities from different layers
      should be coordinated whenever feasible and appropriate to provide
      network survivability in a flexible and cost effective manner.
      Minimization of function duplication across layers is one way to
      achieve the coordination.  Escalation of alarms and other fault
      indicators from lower to higher layers may also be performed in a
      coordinated manner.  A temporal order of restoration trigger
      timing at different layers is another way to coordinate multi-
      layer protection/restoration.

   o  Spare capacity at higher layers is often regarded as working
      traffic at lower layers.  Placing protection/restoration functions
      in many layers may increase redundancy and robustness, but it
      should not result in significant and avoidable inefficiencies in
      network resource utilization.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   o  It is generally desirable to have protection and restoration
      schemes that are bandwidth efficient.

   o  Failure notification throughout the network should be timely and
      reliable.

   o  Alarms and other fault monitoring and reporting capabilities
      should be provided at appropriate layers.

6.5.1.  Survivability in MPLS Based Networks

   MPLS is an important emerging technology that enhances IP networks in
   terms of features, capabilities, and services.  Because MPLS is path-
   oriented, it can potentially provide faster and more predictable
   protection and restoration capabilities than conventional hop by hop
   routed IP systems.  This subsection describes some of the basic
   aspects and recommendations for MPLS networks regarding protection
   and restoration.  See [RFC3469] for a more comprehensive discussion
   on MPLS based recovery.

   Protection types for MPLS networks can be categorized as link
   protection, node protection, path protection, and segment protection.

   o  Link Protection: The objective for link protection is to protect
      an LSP from a given link failure.  Under link protection, the path
      of the protection or backup LSP (the secondary LSP) is disjoint
      from the path of the working or operational LSP at the particular
      link over which protection is required.  When the protected link
      fails, traffic on the working LSP is switched over to the
      protection LSP at the head-end of the failed link.  This is a
      local repair method which can be fast.  It might be more
      appropriate in situations where some network elements along a
      given path are less reliable than others.

   o  Node Protection: The objective of LSP node protection is to
      protect an LSP from a given node failure.  Under node protection,
      the path of the protection LSP is disjoint from the path of the
      working LSP at the particular node to be protected.  The secondary
      path is also disjoint from the primary path at all links
      associated with the node to be protected.  When the node fails,
      traffic on the working LSP is switched over to the protection LSP
      at the upstream LSR directly connected to the failed node.

   o  Path Protection: The goal of LSP path protection is to protect an
      LSP from failure at any point along its routed path.  Under path
      protection, the path of the protection LSP is completely disjoint
      from the path of the working LSP.  The advantage of path
      protection is that the backup LSP protects the working LSP from



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 47]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


      all possible link and node failures along the path, except for
      failures that might occur at the ingress and egress LSRs, or for
      correlated failures that might impact both working and backup
      paths simultaneously.  Additionally, since the path selection is
      end-to-end, path protection might be more efficient in terms of
      resource usage than link or node protection.  However, path
      protection may be slower than link and node protection in general.

   o  Segment Protection: An MPLS domain may be partitioned into
      multiple protection domains whereby a failure in a protection
      domain is rectified within that domain.  In cases where an LSP
      traverses multiple protection domains, a protection mechanism
      within a domain only needs to protect the segment of the LSP that
      lies within the domain.  Segment protection will generally be
      faster than path protection because recovery generally occurs
      closer to the fault.

6.5.2.  Protection Option

   Another issue to consider is the concept of protection options.  The
   protection option uses the notation m:n protection, where m is the
   number of protection LSPs used to protect n working LSPs.  Feasible
   protection options follow.

   o  1:1: one working LSP is protected/restored by one protection LSP.

   o  1:n: one protection LSP is used to protect/restore n working LSPs.

   o  n:1: one working LSP is protected/restored by n protection LSPs,
      possibly with configurable load splitting ratio.  When more than
      one protection LSP is used, it may be desirable to share the
      traffic across the protection LSPs when the working LSP fails to
      satisfy the bandwidth requirement of the traffic trunk associated
      with the working LSP.  This may be especially useful when it is
      not feasible to find one path that can satisfy the bandwidth
      requirement of the primary LSP.

   o  1+1: traffic is sent concurrently on both the working LSP and the
      protection LSP.  In this case, the egress LSR selects one of the
      two LSPs based on a local traffic integrity decision process,
      which compares the traffic received from both the working and the
      protection LSP and identifies discrepancies.  It is unlikely that
      this option would be used extensively in IP networks due to its
      resource utilization inefficiency.  However, if bandwidth becomes
      plentiful and cheap, then this option might become quite viable
      and attractive in IP networks.

6.6.  Traffic Engineering in Diffserv Environments

   This section provides an overview of the traffic engineering features
   and recommendations that are specifically pertinent to Differentiated
   Services (Diffserv) [RFC2475] capable IP networks.

   Increasing requirements to support multiple classes of traffic, such
   as best effort and mission critical data, in the Internet calls for
   IP networks to differentiate traffic according to some criteria, and
   to accord preferential treatment to certain types of traffic.  Large
   numbers of flows can be aggregated into a few behavior aggregates
   based on some criteria in terms of common performance requirements in
   terms of packet loss ratio, delay, and jitter; or in terms of common
   fields within the IP packet headers.

   As Diffserv evolves and becomes deployed in operational networks,
   traffic engineering will be critical to ensuring that SLAs defined
   within a given Diffserv service model are met.  Classes of service
   (CoS) can be supported in a Diffserv environment by concatenating
   per-hop behaviors (PHBs) along the routing path, using service
   provisioning mechanisms, and by appropriately configuring edge
   functionality such as traffic classification, marking, policing, and
   shaping.  PHB is the forwarding behavior that a packet receives at a
   DS node (a Diffserv-compliant node).  This is accomplished by means
   of buffer management and packet scheduling mechanisms.  In this
   context, packets belonging to a class are those that are members of a
   corresponding ordering aggregate.

   Traffic engineering can be used as a compliment to Diffserv
   mechanisms to improve utilization of network resources, but not as a
   necessary element in general.  When traffic engineering is used, it
   can be operated on an aggregated basis across all service classes
   [RFC3270] or on a per service class basis.  The former is used to
   provide better distribution of the aggregate traffic load over the
   network resources.  (See [RFC3270] for detailed mechanisms to support
   aggregate traffic engineering.)  The latter case is discussed below
   since it is specific to the Diffserv environment, with so called
   Diffserv-aware traffic engineering [RFC4124].

   For some Diffserv networks, it may be desirable to control the
   performance of some service classes by enforcing certain
   relationships between the traffic workload contributed by each
   service class and the amount of network resources allocated or
   provisioned for that service class.  Such relationships between
   demand and resource allocation can be enforced using a combination
   of, for example:





Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 49]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   o  traffic engineering mechanisms on a per service class basis that
      enforce the desired relationship between the amount of traffic
      contributed by a given service class and the resources allocated
      to that class

   o  mechanisms that dynamically adjust the resources allocated to a
      given service class to relate to the amount of traffic contributed
      by that service class.

   It may also be desirable to limit the performance impact of high
   priority traffic on relatively low priority traffic.  This can be
   achieved by, for example, controlling the percentage of high priority
   traffic that is routed through a given link.  Another way to
   accomplish this is to increase link capacities appropriately so that
   lower priority traffic can still enjoy adequate service quality.
   When the ratio of traffic workload contributed by different service
   classes vary significantly from router to router, it may not suffice
   to rely exclusively on conventional IGP routing protocols or on
   traffic engineering mechanisms that are insensitive to different
   service classes.  Instead, it may be desirable to perform traffic
   engineering, especially routing control and mapping functions, on a
   per service class basis.  One way to accomplish this in a domain that
   supports both MPLS and Diffserv is to define class specific LSPs and
   to map traffic from each class onto one or more LSPs that correspond
   to that service class.  An LSP corresponding to a given service class
   can then be routed and protected/restored in a class dependent
   manner, according to specific policies.

   Performing traffic engineering on a per class basis may require
   certain per-class parameters to be distributed.  Note that it is
   common to have some classes share some aggregate constraint (e.g.,
   maximum bandwidth requirement) without enforcing the constraint on
   each individual class.  These classes then can be grouped into a
   class-type and per-class-type parameters can be distributed instead
   to improve scalability.  It also allows better bandwidth sharing
   between classes in the same class-type.  A class-type is a set of
   classes that satisfy the following two conditions:

   o  Classes in the same class-type have common aggregate requirements
      to satisfy required performance levels.

   o  There is no requirement to be enforced at the level of individual
      class in the class-type.  Note that it is still possible,
      nevertheless, to implement some priority policies for classes in
      the same class-type to permit preferential access to the class-
      type bandwidth through the use of preemption priorities.





Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 50]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   An example of the class-type can be a low-loss class-type that
   includes both AF1-based and AF2-based Ordering Aggregates.  With such
   a class-type, one may implement some priority policy which assigns
   higher preemption priority to AF1-based traffic trunks over AF2-based
   ones, vice versa, or the same priority.

   See [RFC4124] for detailed requirements on Diffserv-aware traffic
   engineering.

6.7.  Network Controllability

   Off-line (and on-line) traffic engineering considerations would be of
   limited utility if the network could not be controlled effectively to
   implement the results of TE decisions and to achieve desired network
   performance objectives.  Capacity augmentation is a coarse grained
   solution to traffic engineering issues.  However, it is simple and
   may be advantageous if bandwidth is abundant and cheap or if the
   current or expected network workload demands it.  However, bandwidth
   is not always abundant and cheap, and the workload may not always
   demand additional capacity.  Adjustments of administrative weights
   and other parameters associated with routing protocols provide finer
   grained control, but is difficult to use and imprecise because of the
   routing interactions that occur across the network.  In certain
   network contexts, more flexible, finer grained approaches which
   provide more precise control over the mapping of traffic to routes
   and over the selection and placement of routes may be appropriate and
   useful.

   Control mechanisms can be manual (e.g., administrative
   configuration), partially-automated (e.g., scripts) or fully-
   automated (e.g., policy based management systems).  Automated
   mechanisms are particularly required in large scale networks.  Multi-
   vendor interoperability can be facilitated by developing and
   deploying standardized management systems (e.g., standard MIBs) and
   policies (PIBs) to support the control functions required to address
   traffic engineering objectives such as load distribution and
   protection/restoration.

   Network control functions should be secure, reliable, and stable as
   these are often needed to operate correctly in times of network
   impairments (e.g., during network congestion or security attacks).

7.  Inter-Domain Considerations

   Inter-domain traffic engineering is concerned with the performance
   optimization for traffic that originates in one administrative domain
   and terminates in a different one.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Traffic exchange between autonomous systems in the Internet occurs
   through exterior gateway protocols.  Currently, BGP [RFC4271] is the
   standard exterior gateway protocol for the Internet.  BGP provides a
   number of attributes and capabilities (e.g., route filtering) that
   can be used for inter-domain traffic engineering.  More specifically,
   BGP permits the control of routing information and traffic exchange
   between Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet.  BGP incorporates
   a sequential decision process which calculates the degree of
   preference for various routes to a given destination network.  There
   are two fundamental aspects to inter-domain traffic engineering using
   BGP:

   o  Route Redistribution: controlling the import and export of routes
      between AS's, and controlling the redistribution of routes between
      BGP and other protocols within an AS.

   o  Best path selection: selecting the best path when there are
      multiple candidate paths to a given destination network.  Best
      path selection is performed by the BGP decision process based on a
      sequential procedure, taking a number of different considerations
      into account.  Ultimately, best path selection under BGP boils
      down to selecting preferred exit points out of an AS towards
      specific destination networks.  The BGP path selection process can
      be influenced by manipulating the attributes associated with the
      BGP decision process.  These attributes include: NEXT-HOP, WEIGHT
      (Cisco proprietary which is also implemented by some other
      vendors), LOCAL-PREFERENCE, AS-PATH, ROUTE-ORIGIN, MULTI-EXIT-
      DESCRIMINATOR (MED), IGP METRIC, etc.

   Route-maps provide the flexibility to implement complex BGP policies
   based on pre-configured logical conditions.  In particular, Route-
   maps can be used to control import and export policies for incoming
   and outgoing routes, control the redistribution of routes between BGP
   and other protocols, and influence the selection of best paths by
   manipulating the attributes associated with the BGP decision process.
   Very complex logical expressions that implement various types of
   policies can be implemented using a combination of Route-maps, BGP-
   attributes, Access-lists, and Community attributes.

   When looking at possible strategies for inter-domain TE with BGP, it
   must be noted that the outbound traffic exit point is controllable,
   whereas the interconnection point where inbound traffic is received
   from an EBGP peer typically is not, unless a special arrangement is
   made with the peer sending the traffic.  Therefore, it is up to each
   individual network to implement sound TE strategies that deal with
   the efficient delivery of outbound traffic from one's customers to
   one's peering points.  The vast majority of TE policy is based upon a
   "closest exit" strategy, which offloads interdomain traffic at the



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 52]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   nearest outbound peer point towards the destination autonomous
   system.  Most methods of manipulating the point at which inbound
   traffic enters a network from an EBGP peer (inconsistent route
   announcements between peering points, AS pre-pending, and sending
   MEDs) are either ineffective, or not accepted in the peering
   community.

   Inter-domain TE with BGP is generally effective, but it is usually
   applied in a trial-and-error fashion.  A systematic approach for
   inter-domain traffic engineering is yet to be devised.

   Inter-domain TE is inherently more difficult than intra-domain TE
   under the current Internet architecture.  The reasons for this are
   both technical and administrative.  Technically, while topology and
   link state information are helpful for mapping traffic more
   effectively, BGP does not propagate such information across domain
   boundaries for stability and scalability reasons.  Administratively,
   there are differences in operating costs and network capacities
   between domains.  Generally, what may be considered a good solution
   in one domain may not necessarily be a good solution in another
   domain.  Moreover, it would generally be considered inadvisable for
   one domain to permit another domain to influence the routing and
   management of traffic in its network.

   MPLS TE-tunnels (explicit LSPs) can potentially add a degree of
   flexibility in the selection of exit points for inter-domain routing.
   The concept of relative and absolute metrics can be applied to this
   purpose.  The idea is that if BGP attributes are defined such that
   the BGP decision process depends on IGP metrics to select exit points
   for inter-domain traffic, then some inter-domain traffic destined to
   a given peer network can be made to prefer a specific exit point by
   establishing a TE-tunnel between the router making the selection to
   the peering point via a TE-tunnel and assigning the TE-tunnel a
   metric which is smaller than the IGP cost to all other peering
   points.  If a peer accepts and processes MEDs, then a similar MPLS
   TE-tunnel based scheme can be applied to cause certain entrance
   points to be preferred by setting MED to be an IGP cost, which has
   been modified by the tunnel metric.

   Similar to intra-domain TE, inter-domain TE is best accomplished when
   a traffic matrix can be derived to depict the volume of traffic from
   one autonomous system to another.

   Generally, redistribution of inter-domain traffic requires
   coordination between peering partners.  An export policy in one
   domain that results in load redistribution across peer points with
   another domain can significantly affect the local traffic matrix
   inside the domain of the peering partner.  This, in turn, will affect

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   the intra-domain TE due to changes in the spatial distribution of
   traffic.  Therefore, it is mutually beneficial for peering partners
   to coordinate with each other before attempting any policy changes
   that may result in significant shifts in inter-domain traffic.  In
   certain contexts, this coordination can be quite challenging due to
   technical and non- technical reasons.

   It is a matter of speculation as to whether MPLS, or similar
   technologies, can be extended to allow selection of constrained paths
   across domain boundaries.

8.  Overview of Contemporary TE Practices in Operational IP Networks

   This section provides an overview of some contemporary traffic
   engineering practices in IP networks.  The focus is primarily on the
   aspects that pertain to the control of the routing function in
   operational contexts.  The intent here is to provide an overview of
   the commonly used practices.  The discussion is not intended to be
   exhaustive.

   Currently, service providers apply many of the traffic engineering
   mechanisms discussed in this document to optimize the performance of
   their IP networks.  These techniques include capacity planning for
   long timescales, routing control using IGP metrics and MPLS for
   medium timescales, the overlay model also for medium timescales, and
   traffic management mechanisms for short timescale.

   When a service provider plans to build an IP network, or expand the
   capacity of an existing network, effective capacity planning should
   be an important component of the process.  Such plans may take the
   following aspects into account: location of new nodes if any,
   existing and predicted traffic patterns, costs, link capacity,
   topology, routing design, and survivability.

   Performance optimization of operational networks is usually an
   ongoing process in which traffic statistics, performance parameters,
   and fault indicators are continually collected from the network.
   This empirical data is then analyzed and used to trigger various
   traffic engineering mechanisms.  Tools that perform what-if analysis
   can also be used to assist the TE process by allowing various
   scenarios to be reviewed before a new set of configurations are
   implemented in the operational network.

   Traditionally, intra-domain real-time TE with IGP is done by
   increasing the OSPF or IS-IS metric of a congested link until enough
   traffic has been diverted from that link.  This approach has some
   limitations as discussed in Section 6.2.  Recently, some new intra-
   domain TE approaches/tools have been proposed [RR94] [FT00] [FT01]



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 54]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   [WANG].  Such approaches/tools take traffic matrix, network topology,
   and network performance objectives as input, and produce some link
   metrics and possibly some unequal load-sharing ratios to be set at
   the head-end routers of some ECMPs as output.  These new progresses
   open new possibility for intra-domain TE with IGP to be done in a
   more systematic way.

   The overlay model (IP over ATM, or IP over Frame Relay) is another
   approach which was commonly used [AWD2], but has been replaced by
   MPLS and router hardware technology.

   Deployment of MPLS for traffic engineering applications has commenced
   in some service provider networks.  One operational scenario is to
   deploy MPLS in conjunction with an IGP (IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) that
   supports the traffic engineering extensions, in conjunction with
   constraint-based routing for explicit route computations, and a
   signaling protocol (e.g., RSVP-TE) for LSP instantiation.

   In contemporary MPLS traffic engineering contexts, network
   administrators specify and configure link attributes and resource
   constraints such as maximum reservable bandwidth and resource class
   attributes for links (interfaces) within the MPLS domain.  A link
   state protocol that supports TE extensions (IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) is
   used to propagate information about network topology and link
   attribute to all routers in the routing area.  Network administrators
   also specify all the LSPs that are to originate each router.  For
   each LSP, the network administrator specifies the destination node
   and the attributes of the LSP which indicate the requirements that to
   be satisfied during the path selection process.  Each router then
   uses a local constraint-based routing process to compute explicit
   paths for all LSPs originating from it.  Subsequently, a signaling
   protocol is used to instantiate the LSPs.  By assigning proper
   bandwidth values to links and LSPs, congestion caused by uneven
   traffic distribution can generally be avoided or mitigated.

   The bandwidth attributes of LSPs used for traffic engineering can be
   updated periodically.  The basic concept is that the bandwidth
   assigned to an LSP should relate in some manner to the bandwidth
   requirements of traffic that actually flows through the LSP.  The
   traffic attribute of an LSP can be modified to accommodate traffic
   growth and persistent traffic shifts.  If network congestion occurs
   due to some unexpected events, existing LSPs can be rerouted to
   alleviate the situation or network administrator can configure new
   LSPs to divert some traffic to alternative paths.  The reservable
   bandwidth of the congested links can also be reduced to force some
   LSPs to be rerouted to other paths.

   In an MPLS domain, a traffic matrix can also be estimated by
   monitoring the traffic on LSPs.  Such traffic statistics can be used
   for a variety of purposes including network planning and network
   optimization.  Current practice suggests that deploying an MPLS
   network consisting of hundreds of routers and thousands of LSPs is
   feasible.  In summary, recent deployment experience suggests that
   MPLS approach is very effective for traffic engineering in IP
   networks [XIAO].

   As mentioned previously in Section 7, one usually has no direct
   control over the distribution of inbound traffic.  Therefore, the
   main goal of contemporary inter-domain TE is to optimize the
   distribution of outbound traffic between multiple inter-domain links.
   When operating a global network, maintaining the ability to operate
   the network in a regional fashion where desired, while continuing to
   take advantage of the benefits of a global network, also becomes an
   important objective.

   Inter-domain TE with BGP usually begins with the placement of
   multiple peering interconnection points in locations that have high
   peer density, are in close proximity to originating/terminating
   traffic locations on one's own network, and are lowest in cost.
   There are generally several locations in each region of the world
   where the vast majority of major networks congregate and
   interconnect.  Some location-decision problems that arise in
   association with inter-domain routing are discussed in [AWD5].

   Once the locations of the interconnects are determined, and circuits
   are implemented, one decides how best to handle the routes heard from
   the peer, as well as how to propagate the peers' routes within one's
   own network.  One way to engineer outbound traffic flows on a network
   with many EBGP peers is to create a hierarchy of peers.  Generally,
   the Local Preferences of all peers are set to the same value so that
   the shortest AS paths will be chosen to forward traffic.  Then, by
   over-writing the inbound MED metric (Multi-exit-discriminator metric,
   also referred to as "BGP metric".  Both terms are used
   interchangeably in this document) with BGP metrics to routes received
   at different peers, the hierarchy can be formed.  For example, all
   Local Preferences can be set to 200, preferred private peers can be
   assigned a BGP metric of 50, the rest of the private peers can be
   assigned a BGP metric of 100, and public peers can be assigned a BGP
   metric of 600.  "Preferred" peers might be defined as those peers
   with whom the most available capacity exists, whose customer base is
   larger in comparison to other peers, whose interconnection costs are
   the lowest, and with whom upgrading existing capacity is the easiest.
   In a network with low utilization at the edge, this works well.  The
   same concept could be applied to a network with higher edge
   utilization by creating more levels of BGP metrics between peers,



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 56]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   allowing for more granularity in selecting the exit points for
   traffic bound for a dual homed customer on a peer's network.

   By only replacing inbound MED metrics with BGP metrics, only equal
   AS-Path length routes' exit points are being changed.  (The BGP
   decision considers Local Preference first, then AS-Path length, and
   then BGP metric).  For example, assume a network has two possible
   egress points, peer A and peer B.  Each peer has 40% of the
   Internet's routes exclusively on its network, while the remaining 20%
   of the Internet's routes are from customers who dual home between A
   and B.  Assume that both peers have a Local Preference of 200 and a
   BGP metric of 100.  If the link to peer A is congested, increasing
   its BGP metric while leaving the Local Preference at 200 will ensure
   that the 20% of total routes belonging to dual homed customers will
   prefer peer B as the exit point.  The previous example would be used
   in a situation where all exit points to a given peer were close to
   congestion levels, and traffic needed to be shifted away from that
   peer entirely.

   When there are multiple exit points to a given peer, and only one of
   them is congested, it is not necessary to shift traffic away from the
   peer entirely, but only from the one congested circuit.  This can be
   achieved by using passive IGP-metrics, AS-path filtering, or prefix
   filtering.

   Occasionally, more drastic changes are needed, for example, in
   dealing with a "problem peer" who is difficult to work with on
   upgrades or is charging high prices for connectivity to their
   network.  In that case, the Local Preference to that peer can be
   reduced below the level of other peers.  This effectively reduces the
   amount of traffic sent to that peer to only originating traffic
   (assuming no transit providers are involved).  This type of change
   can affect a large amount of traffic, and is only used after other
   methods have failed to provide the desired results.

   Although it is not much of an issue in regional networks, the
   propagation of a peer's routes back through the network must be
   considered when a network is peering on a global scale.  Sometimes,
   business considerations can influence the choice of BGP policies in a
   given context.  For example, it may be imprudent, from a business
   perspective, to operate a global network and provide full access to
   the global customer base to a small network in a particular country.
   However, for the purpose of providing one's own customers with
   quality service in a particular region, good connectivity to that in-
   country network may still be necessary.  This can be achieved by
   assigning a set of communities at the edge of the network, which have
   a known behavior when routes tagged with those communities are
   propagating back through the core.  Routes heard from local peers

   will be prevented from propagating back to the global network,
   whereas routes learned from larger peers may be allowed to propagate
   freely throughout the entire global network.  By implementing a
   flexible community strategy, the benefits of using a single global AS
   Number (ASN) can be realized, while the benefits of operating
   regional networks can also be taken advantage of.  An alternative to
   doing this is to use different ASNs in different regions, with the
   consequence that the AS path length for routes announced by that
   service provider will increase.

Appendix A.  Historic Overview

A.1.  Traffic Engineering in Classical Telephone Networks

   This subsection presents a brief overview of traffic engineering in
   telephone networks which often relates to the way user traffic is
   steered from an originating node to the terminating node.  This
   subsection presents a brief overview of this topic.  A detailed
   description of the various routing strategies applied in telephone
   networks is included in the book by G.  Ash [ASH2].

   The early telephone network relied on static hierarchical routing,
   whereby routing patterns remained fixed independent of the state of
   the network or time of day.  The hierarchy was intended to
   accommodate overflow traffic, improve network reliability via
   alternate routes, and prevent call looping by employing strict
   hierarchical rules.  The network was typically over-provisioned since

   a given fixed route had to be dimensioned so that it could carry user
   traffic during a busy hour of any busy day.  Hierarchical routing in
   the telephony network was found to be too rigid upon the advent of
   digital switches and stored program control which were able to manage
   more complicated traffic engineering rules.

   Dynamic routing was introduced to alleviate the routing inflexibility
   in the static hierarchical routing so that the network would operate
   more efficiently.  This resulted in significant economic gains
   [HUSS87].  Dynamic routing typically reduces the overall loss
   probability by 10 to 20 percent (compared to static hierarchical
   routing).  Dynamic routing can also improve network resilience by
   recalculating routes on a per-call basis and periodically updating
   routes.

   There are three main types of dynamic routing in the telephone
   network.  They are time-dependent routing, state-dependent routing
   (SDR), and event dependent routing (EDR).

   In time-dependent routing, regular variations in traffic loads (such
   as time of day or day of week) are exploited in pre-planned routing
   tables.  In state-dependent routing, routing tables are updated
   online according to the current state of the network (e.g., traffic
   demand, utilization, etc.).  In event dependent routing, routing
   changes are incepted by events (such as call setups encountering
   congested or blocked links) whereupon new paths are searched out
   using learning models.  EDR methods are real-time adaptive, but they
   do not require global state information as does SDR.  Examples of EDR
   schemes include the dynamic alternate routing (DAR) from BT, the
   state-and-time dependent routing (STR) from NTT, and the success-to-
   the-top (STT) routing from AT&T.

   Dynamic non-hierarchical routing (DNHR) is an example of dynamic
   routing that was introduced in the AT&T toll network in the 1980's to
   respond to time-dependent information such as regular load variations
   as a function of time.  Time-dependent information in terms of load
   may be divided into three timescales: hourly, weekly, and yearly.
   Correspondingly, three algorithms are defined to pre-plan the routing
   tables.  The network design algorithm operates over a year-long
   interval while the demand servicing algorithm operates on a weekly
   basis to fine tune link sizes and routing tables to correct forecast
   errors on the yearly basis.  At the smallest timescale, the routing
   algorithm is used to make limited adjustments based on daily traffic
   variations.  Network design and demand servicing are computed using
   offline calculations.  Typically, the calculations require extensive
   searches on possible routes.  On the other hand, routing may need
   online calculations to handle crankback.  DNHR adopts a "two-link"
   approach whereby a path can consist of two links at most.  The

   routing algorithm presents an ordered list of route choices between
   an originating switch and a terminating switch.  If a call overflows,
   a via switch (a tandem exchange between the originating switch and
   the terminating switch) would send a crankback signal to the
   originating switch.  This switch would then select the next route,
   and so on, until there are no alternative routes available in which
   the call is blocked.

A.2.  Evolution of Traffic Engineering in Packet Networks

   This subsection reviews related prior work that was intended to
   improve the performance of data networks.  Indeed, optimization of
   the performance of data networks started in the early days of the
   ARPANET.  Other early commercial networks such as SNA also recognized
   the importance of performance optimization and service
   differentiation.

   In terms of traffic management, the Internet has been a best effort
   service environment until recently.  In particular, very limited
   traffic management capabilities existed in IP networks to provide
   differentiated queue management and scheduling services to packets
   belonging to different classes.

   In terms of routing control, the Internet has employed distributed
   protocols for intra-domain routing.  These protocols are highly
   scalable and resilient.  However, they are based on simple algorithms
   for path selection which have very limited functionality to allow
   flexible control of the path selection process.

   In the following subsections, the evolution of practical traffic
   engineering mechanisms in IP networks and its predecessors are
   reviewed.

A.2.1.  Adaptive Routing in the ARPANET

   The early ARPANET recognized the importance of adaptive routing where
   routing decisions were based on the current state of the network
   [MCQ80].  Early minimum delay routing approaches forwarded each
   packet to its destination along a path for which the total estimated
   transit time was the smallest.  Each node maintained a table of
   network delays, representing the estimated delay that a packet would
   experience along a given path toward its destination.  The minimum
   delay table was periodically transmitted by a node to its neighbors.
   The shortest path, in terms of hop count, was also propagated to give
   the connectivity information.

   One drawback to this approach is that dynamic link metrics tend to
   create "traffic magnets" causing congestion to be shifted from one

   location of a network to another location, resulting in oscillation
   and network instability.

A.2.2.  Dynamic Routing in the Internet

   The Internet evolved from the ARPANET and adopted dynamic routing
   algorithms with distributed control to determine the paths that
   packets should take en-route to their destinations.  The routing
   algorithms are adaptations of shortest path algorithms where costs
   are based on link metrics.  The link metric can be based on static or
   dynamic quantities.  The link metric based on static quantities may
   be assigned administratively according to local criteria.  The link
   metric based on dynamic quantities may be a function of a network
   congestion measure such as delay or packet loss.

   It was apparent early that static link metric assignment was
   inadequate because it can easily lead to unfavorable scenarios in
   which some links become congested while others remain lightly loaded.
   One of the many reasons for the inadequacy of static link metrics is
   that link metric assignment was often done without considering the
   traffic matrix in the network.  Also, the routing protocols did not
   take traffic attributes and capacity constraints into account when
   making routing decisions.  This results in traffic concentration
   being localized in subsets of the network infrastructure and
   potentially causing congestion.  Even if link metrics are assigned in
   accordance with the traffic matrix, unbalanced loads in the network
   can still occur due to a number factors including:

   o  Resources may not be deployed in the most optimal locations from a
      routing perspective.

   o  Forecasting errors in traffic volume and/or traffic distribution.

   o  Dynamics in traffic matrix due to the temporal nature of traffic
      patterns, BGP policy change from peers, etc.

   The inadequacy of the legacy Internet interior gateway routing system
   is one of the factors motivating the interest in path oriented
   technology with explicit routing and constraint-based routing
   capability such as MPLS.

A.2.3.  ToS Routing

   Type-of-Service (ToS) routing involves different routes going to the
   same destination with selection dependent upon the ToS field of an IP
   packet [RFC2474].  The ToS classes may be classified as low delay and
   high throughput.  Each link is associated with multiple link costs
   and each link cost is used to compute routes for a particular ToS.  A



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 73]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   separate shortest path tree is computed for each ToS.  The shortest
   path algorithm must be run for each ToS resulting in very expensive
   computation.  Classical ToS-based routing is now outdated as the IP
   header field has been replaced by a Diffserv field.  Effective
   traffic engineering is difficult to perform in classical ToS-based
   routing because each class still relies exclusively on shortest path
   routing which results in localization of traffic concentration within
   the network.

A.2.4.  Equal Cost Multi-Path

   Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) is another technique that attempts to
   address the deficiency in the Shortest Path First (SPF) interior
   gateway routing systems [RFC2328].  In the classical SPF algorithm,
   if two or more shortest paths exist to a given destination, the
   algorithm will choose one of them.  The algorithm is modified
   slightly in ECMP so that if two or more equal cost shortest paths
   exist between two nodes, the traffic between the nodes is distributed
   among the multiple equal-cost paths.  Traffic distribution across the
   equal-cost paths is usually performed in one of two ways: (1) packet-
   based in a round-robin fashion, or (2) flow-based using hashing on
   source and destination IP addresses and possibly other fields of the
   IP header.  The first approach can easily cause out- of-order packets
   while the second approach is dependent upon the number and
   distribution of flows.  Flow-based load sharing may be unpredictable
   in an enterprise network where the number of flows is relatively
   small and less heterogeneous (for example, hashing may not be
   uniform), but it is generally effective in core public networks where
   the number of flows is large and heterogeneous.

   In ECMP, link costs are static and bandwidth constraints are not
   considered, so ECMP attempts to distribute the traffic as equally as
   possible among the equal-cost paths independent of the congestion
   status of each path.  As a result, given two equal-cost paths, it is
   possible that one of the paths will be more congested than the other.
   Another drawback of ECMP is that load sharing cannot be achieved on
   multiple paths which have non-identical costs.

A.2.5.  Nimrod

   Nimrod was a routing system developed to provide heterogeneous
   service specific routing in the Internet, while taking multiple
   constraints into account [RFC1992].  Essentially, Nimrod was a link
   state routing protocol to support path oriented packet forwarding.
   It used the concept of maps to represent network connectivity and
   services at multiple levels of abstraction.  Mechanisms allowed
   restriction of the distribution of routing information.

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Even though Nimrod did not enjoy deployment in the public Internet, a
   number of key concepts incorporated into the Nimrod architecture,
   such as explicit routing which allows selection of paths at
   originating nodes, are beginning to find applications in some recent
   constraint-based routing initiatives.

A.3.  Development of Internet Traffic Engineering

A.3.1.  Overlay Model

   In the overlay model, a virtual-circuit network, such as Sonet/SDH,
   OTN, or WDM, provides virtual-circuit connectivity between routers
   that are located at the edges of a virtual-circuit cloud.  In this
   mode, two routers that are connected through a virtual circuit see a
   direct adjacency between themselves independent of the physical route
   taken by the virtual circuit through the ATM, frame relay, or WDM
   network.  Thus, the overlay model essentially decouples the logical
   topology that routers see from the physical topology that the ATM,
   frame relay, or WDM network manages.  The overlay model based on ATM
   or frame relay enables a network administrator or an automaton to
   employ traffic engineering concepts to perform path optimization by
   re-configuring or rearranging the virtual circuits so that a virtual
   circuit on a congested or sub-optimal physical link can be re-routed
   to a less congested or more optimal one.  In the overlay model,
   traffic engineering is also employed to establish relationships
   between the traffic management parameters (e.g., PCR, SCR, and MBS
   for ATM) of the virtual-circuit technology and the actual traffic
   that traverses each circuit.  These relationships can be established
   based upon known or projected traffic profiles, and some other
   factors.

B.1.  Overview of ITU Activities Related to Traffic Engineering

   This section provides an overview of prior work within the ITU-T
   pertaining to traffic engineering in traditional telecommunications
   networks.

   ITU-T Recommendations E.600 [ITU-E600], E.701 [ITU-E701], and E.801
   [ITU-E801] address traffic engineering issues in traditional
   telecommunications networks.  Recommendation E.600 provides a
   vocabulary for describing traffic engineering concepts, while E.701
   defines reference connections, Grade of Service (GOS), and traffic
   parameters for ISDN.  Recommendation E.701 uses the concept of a
   reference connection to identify representative cases of different
   types of connections without describing the specifics of their actual
   realizations by different physical means.  As defined in



Farrel                    Expires May 20, 2021                 [Page 75]

Internet-Draft   Overview and Principles of Internet TE    November 2020


   Recommendation E.600, "a connection is an association of resources
   providing means for communication between two or more devices in, or
   attached to, a telecommunication network."  Also, E.600 defines "a
   resource as any set of physically or conceptually identifiable
   entities within a telecommunication network, the use of which can be
   unambiguously determined" [ITU-E600].  There can be different types
   of connections as the number and types of resources in a connection
   may vary.

   Typically, different network segments are involved in the path of a
   connection.  For example, a connection may be local, national, or
   international.  The purposes of reference connections are to clarify
   and specify traffic performance issues at various interfaces between
   different network domains.  Each domain may consist of one or more
   service provider networks.

   Reference connections provide a basis to define grade of service
   (GoS) parameters related to traffic engineering within the ITU-T
   framework.  As defined in E.600, "GoS refers to a number of traffic
   engineering variables which are used to provide a measure of the
   adequacy of a group of resources under specified conditions."  These
   GoS variables may be probability of loss, dial tone, delay, etc.
   They are essential for network internal design and operation as well
   as for component performance specification.

   GoS is different from quality of service (QoS) in the ITU framework.
   QoS is the performance perceivable by a telecommunication service
   user and expresses the user's degree of satisfaction of the service.
   QoS parameters focus on performance aspects observable at the service
   access points and network interfaces, rather than their causes within
   the network.  GoS, on the other hand, is a set of network oriented
   measures which characterize the adequacy of a group of resources
   under specified conditions.  For a network to be effective in serving
   its users, the values of both GoS and QoS parameters must be related,
   with GoS parameters typically making a major contribution to the QoS.

   Recommendation E.600 stipulates that a set of GoS parameters must be
   selected and defined on an end-to-end basis for each major service
   category provided by a network to assist the network provider with
   improving efficiency and effectiveness of the network.  Based on a
   selected set of reference connections, suitable target values are
   assigned to the selected GoS parameters under normal and high load
   conditions.  These end-to-end GoS target values are then apportioned
   to individual resource components of the reference connections for
   dimensioning purposes.
