              Admin Interface for the OSCORE Group Manager
                  draft-tiloca-ace-oscore-gm-admin-01

Abstract

   Group communication for CoAP can be secured using Group Object
   Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE).  A
   Group Manager is responsible to handle the joining of new group
   members, as well as to manage and distribute the group key material.
   This document defines a RESTful admin interface at the Group Manager,
   that allows an Administrator entity to create and delete OSCORE
   groups, as well as to retrieve and update their configuration.  The
   ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization is used to enforce
   authentication and authorization of the Administrator at the Group
   Manager.  Protocol-specific transport profiles of ACE are used to
   achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and server
   authentication.

Internet-Draft      Admin Interface for the OSCORE GM         March 2020


1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] can be used in
   group communication environments where messages are also exchanged
   over IP multicast [I-D.dijk-core-groupcomm-bis].  Applications
   relying on CoAP can achieve end-to-end security at the application
   layer by using Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
   (OSCORE) [RFC8613], and especially Group OSCORE
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] in group communication scenarios.

   When group communication for CoAP is protected with Group OSCORE,
   nodes are required to explicitly join the correct OSCORE group.  To
   this end, a joining node interacts with a Group Manager (GM) entity
   responsible for that group, and retrieves the required key material
   to securely communicate with other group members using Group OSCORE.

   The method in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore] specifies how nodes
   can join an OSCORE group through the respective Group Manager.  Such
   a method builds on the ACE framework for Authentication and
   Authorization [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], so ensuring a secure
   joining process as well as authentication and authorization of
   joining nodes (clients) at the Group Manager (resource server).

   This document specifies a RESTful admin interface at the Group
   Manager, intended for an Administrator entity.  The interface allows
   the Administrator to create and delete OSCORE groups, as well as to
   configure and update their configuration.  Interaction examples are
   provided, in Link Format [RFC6690] and CBOR [RFC7049], as well as in
   CoRAL [I-D.ietf-core-coral].  While all the CoRAL examples use the
   CoRAL textual serialization format, the CBOR or JSON [RFC8259] binary
   serialization format is used when sending such messages on the wire.

   The ACE framework is used to ensure authentication and authorization
   of the Administrator (client) at the Group Manager (resource server).
   In order to achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and
   server authentication, the Administrator and the Group Manager
   leverage protocol-specific transport profiles of ACE, such as
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile][I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize].  These
   include also possible forthcoming transport profiles that comply with
   the requirements in Appendix C of [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to CBOR [RFC7049] and COSE [RFC8152], the CoAP protocol
   [RFC7252], as well as the protection and processing of CoAP messages
   using OSCORE [RFC8613], also in group communication scenarios using
   Group OSCORE [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].  These include the
   concept of Group Manager, as the entity responsible for a set of
   groups where communications among members are secured using Group
   OSCORE.

   Readers are also expected to be familiar with the terms and concept
   related to the management of keying material for groups in ACE
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm], and in particular to the
   joining process for OSCORE groups defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore].  These include the concept of
   group-membership resource hosted by the Group Manager, that new
   members access to join the OSCORE group, while current members can
   access to retrieve updated keying material.

   Readers are also expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in the ACE framework for authentication and authorization
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  The terminology for entities in the
   considered architecture is defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  In
   particular, this includes Client (C), Resource Server (RS), and
   Authorization Server (AS).

   Note that, unless otherwise indicated, the term "endpoint" is used
   here following its OAuth definition, aimed at denoting resources such
   as /token and /introspect at the AS, and /authz-info at the RS.  This
   document does not use the CoAP definition of "endpoint", which is "An
   entity participating in the CoAP protocol".

   This document also refers to the following terminology.

   o  Administrator: entity responsible to create, configure and delete
      OSCORE groups at a Group Manager.

   o  Group name: stable and invariant name of an OSCORE group.  The
      group name MUST be unique under the same Group Manager, and MUST
      include only characters that are valid for a URI path segment,
      namely unreserved and pct-encoded characters [RFC3986].

   o  Group-collection resource: a single-instance resource hosted by
      the Group Manager.  An Administrator accesses a group-collection
      resource to create a new OSCORE group, or to retrieve the list of
      existing OSCORE groups, under that Group Manager.  The URI of the
      group-collection resource is fixed and has /manage as last path
      segment.  The url-path /manage is a default name: implementations

      are not required to use this name, and can define their own
      instead.

   o  Group-configuration resource: a resource hosted by the Group
      Manager, associated to an OSCORE group under that Group Manager.
      A group-configuration resource is identifiable with the invariant
      group name of the respective group.  An Administrator accesses a
      group-configuration resource to retrieve or update the
      configuration of the respective OSCORE group, or to delete that
      group.  The URI of a group-configuration resource is fixed and has
      /manage/NAME as last path segments, with NAME the invariant group
      name assigned upon its creation.  The url-path /manage/NAME is a
      default name: implementations are not required to use this name,
      and can define their own instead.

   o  Admin endpoint: an endpoint at the Group Manager associated to the
      group-collection resource or to a group-configuration resource
      hosted by that Group Manager.

2.  Group Administration

   With reference to the ACE framework and the terminology defined in
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]:

   o  The Group Manager acts as Resource Server (RS).  It provides one
      single group-collection resource, and one group-configuration
      resource per existing OSCORE group.  Each of those is exported by
      a distinct admin endpoint.

   o  The Administrator acts as Client (C), and requests to access the
      group-collection resource and group-configuration resources, by
      accessing the respective admin endpoint at the Group Manager.

   o  The Authorization Server (AS) authorizes the Administrator to
      access the group-collection resource and group-configuration
      resources at a Group Manager.  Multiple Group Managers can be
      associated to the same AS.  The AS MAY release Access Tokens to
      the Administrator for other purposes than accessing admin
      endpoints of registered Group Managers.

2.1.  Getting Access to the Group Manager

   All communications between the involved entities rely on the CoAP
   protocol and MUST be secured.

   In particular, communications between the Administrator and the Group
   Manager leverage protocol-specific transport profiles of ACE to
   achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and server



Tiloca, et al.         Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Admin Interface for the OSCORE GM         March 2020


   authentication.  To this end, the AS may explicitly signal the
   specific transport profile to use, consistently with requirements and
   assumptions defined in the ACE framework [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   With reference to the AS, communications between the Administrator
   and the AS (/token endpoint) as well as between the Group Manager and
   the AS (/introspect endpoint) can be secured by different means, for
   instance using DTLS [RFC6347][I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] or OSCORE
   [RFC8613].  Further details on how the AS secures communications
   (with the Administrator and the Group Manager) depend on the
   specifically used transport profile of ACE, and are out of the scope
   of this specification.

   In order to get access to the Group Manager for managing OSCORE
   groups, an Administrator performs the following steps.

   1.  The Administrator requests an Access Token from the AS, in order
       to access the group-collection and group-configuration resources
       on the Group Manager.  The Administrator will start or continue
       using secure communications with the Group Manager, according to
       the response from the AS.

   2.  The Administrator transfers authentication and authorization
       information to the Group Manager by posting the obtained Access
       Token, according to the used profile of ACE, such as
       [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] and [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile].
       After that, the Administrator must have secure communication
       established with the Group Manager, before performing any admin
       operation on that Group Manager.  Possible ways to provide secure
       communication are DTLS [RFC6347][I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] and OSCORE
       [RFC8613].  The Administrator and the Group Manager maintain the
       secure association, to support possible future communications.

   3.  The Administrator performs admin operations at the Group Manager,
       as described in the following sections.  These include the
       retrieval of the existing OSCORE groups, the creation of new
       OSCORE groups, the update and retrieval of group configurations,
       and the removal of OSCORE groups.  Messages exchanged among the
       Administrator and the Group Manager are specified in Section 2.5.

                  Figure 1: Resources of a Group Manager

   The Group Manager exports a single group-collection resource.  The
   full interface for the group-collection resource allows the
   Administrator to:

   o  Retrieve the list of existing OSCORE groups, possibly by filters.

   o  Create a new OSCORE group, specifying its invariant group name
      and, optionally, its configuration.

   The Group Manager exports one group-configuration resource for each
   of its OSCORE groups.  Each group-configuration resource is
   identified by the group name specified upon creating the group.  The
   full interface for a group-configuration resource allows the
   Administrator to:

   o  Retrieve the current configuration of the OSCORE group.

   o  Update the current configuration of the OSCORE group.

   o  Delete the OSCORE group.

2.3.  Group Configurations

   A group configuration consists of a set of parameters.

2.3.1.  Group Configuration Representation

   The group configuration representation is a CBOR map which MUST
   include configuration properties and status properties.

2.3.1.1.  Configuration Properties

   The CBOR map MUST include the following configuration parameters:

   pre-configured default value, if none is specified by the
   Administrator.

   In particular, the Group Manager SHOULD use the same default values
   in Section 3.2 of [RFC8613] for 'hkdf' and 'alg'.

   Also, the Group Manager SHOULD use the following as default values
   for 'cs_alg', 'cs_params', 'cs_key_params' and 'cs_key_enc',
   consistently with the "COSE Algorithms" Registry defined in
   Section 16.4 of [RFC8152], as well as with the "Counter Signature
   Parameters" Registry and "Counter Signature Key Parameters" Registry

         elliptic curve Ed448 [RFC8032] is specified for 'cs_params'.

      *  The array [EC2, P-256] as pair (key type, elliptic curve), in
         case ES256 [RFC6979] is specified for 'cs_alg' and the elliptic
         curve P-256 is assumed or specified for 'cs_params'.

      *  The array [EC2, P-384] as pair (key type, elliptic curve), in
         case ES384 [RFC6979] is specified for 'cs_alg' and the elliptic
         curve P-384 is specified for 'cs_params'.

      *  The array [EC2, P-521] as pair (key type, elliptic curve), in
         case ES512 [RFC6979] is specified for 'cs_alg' and the elliptic
         curve P-521 is specified for 'cs_params'.

      *  RSA as key type, if PS256, PS384 or PS512 [RFC8017] is
         specified for 'cs_alg'.

      Confirmation Methods" Registry defined in Section 7.2.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].

2.3.2.2.  Status Parameters

   For the fowllowing status parameters, the Group Manager MUST assume a
   pre-configured default value, if none is specified by the
   Administrator.

   o  For 'active', the CBOR simple value False.

   o  For 'group_title', an empty text string.

2.4.  Discovery

   The Administrator can discover the group-collection resource from a
   resource directory, for instance [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory]
   and [I-D.hartke-t2trg-coral-reef], or from .well-known/core , by
   using the resource type "ace.oscore.gm" defined in Section 4.2 of
   this specification.

   The Administrator can discover group-configuration resources for the
   group-collection resource as specified below in Section 2.5.1 and
   Section 2.5.2.

2.4.1.  Collection Representation

   A list of group configurations is represented as a document
   containing the corresponding group-configuration resources in the
   list.  Each group-configuration is represented as a link, where the
   link target is the URI of the group-configuration resource.

   The list can be represented as a Link Format document [RFC6690] or a
   CoRAL document [I-D.ietf-core-coral].  In the latter case, the CoRAL
   document contains the group-configuration resources in the list as
   top-level elements.  In particular, the link to each group-
   configuration resource has http://coreapps.org/ace.oscore.gm#item as
   relation type.

2.5.  Interactions

   This section describes the operations available on the group-
   collection resource and the group-configuration resources.

   When custom CBOR is used, the Content-Format in messages containing a
   payload is set to application/ace-groupcomm+cbor, defined in
   Section 9.2 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].  Furthermore, the entry
   labels defined in Section 4.1 MUST be used, when specifying the
   corresponding configuration and status parameters.

2.5.1.  Get All Groups Configurations

   The Administrator can send a GET request to the group-collection
   resource, in order to retrieve the list of the existing OSCORE groups
   at the Group Manager.  This is returned as a list of links to the
   corresponding group-configuration resources.

      item <gp1>
      item <gp2>
      item <gp3>

2.5.2.  Fetch Group Configurations By Filters

   The Administrator can send a FETCH request to the group-collection
   resource, in order to retrieve the list of the existing OSCORE groups
   at the Group Manager that fully match a set of specified filter
   criteria.  This is returned as a list of links to the corresponding
   group-configuration resources.

   The set of filter criteria is specified in the request payload as a
   CBOR map, where possible entry labels are all the ones used for
   configuration properties (see Section 2.3.1.1), as well as
   "group_name" and "active" for the corresponding status property (see
   Section 2.3.1.2).

   Entry values are the ones admitted for the corresponding labels in
   the POST request for creating a group configuration (see
   Section 2.5.3).  A valid request MUST NOT include the same entry
   multiple times.

   Example in custom CBOR and Link Format:

2.5.3.  Create a New Group Configuration

   The Administrator can send a POST request to the group-collection
   resource, in order to create a new OSCORE group at the Group Manager.
   The request MAY specify the intended group name NAME and group title,
   and MAY specify pieces of information concerning the group
   configuration.

   The request payload is a CBOR map, whose possible entries are
   specified in Section 2.3.1.  In particular:

   o  The CBOR map MAY include any of the configuration parameter
      defined in Section 2.3.1.1.




Tiloca, et al.         Expires September 10, 2020              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Admin Interface for the OSCORE GM         March 2020


   o  The CBOR map MAY include any of the status parameter 'group_name',
      'group_title', 'exp', 'group_policies', 'as_uri' and 'active'
      defined in Section 2.3.1.2.

   o  The CBOR map MUST NOT include any of the status parameter 'ace-
      groupcomm-profile' and 'joining_path' defined in Section 2.3.1.2.

   If any of the following occurs, the Group Manager MUST respond with a
   4.00 (Bad Request) response, which MAY include additional information
   to clarify what went wrong.

   o  Any of the received parameters is specified multiple times.

   o  Any of the received parameters is not recognized, or not valid, or
      not consistent with respect to other related parameters.

   o  The 'group_name' parameter specifies the group name of an already
      existing OSCORE group.

   o  The 'as_uri' parameter specifies the URI of an Authorization
      Server that the Group Manager does not trust or is not fine to
      consider for this OSCORE group.

   After a successful processing of the request above, the Group Manager
   performs the following actions.

   First, the Group Manager creates a new group-configuration resource,
   accessible to the administrator at /manage/NAME , where NAME is the
   group name as either indicated in the parameter 'group_name' of the
   request or uniquely assigned by the Group Manager.  The values
   specified in the request are used as group configuration information
   for the newly created OSCORE group.  For each configuration parameter
   not specified in the request, the Group Manager MUST assume the
   default value specified in Section 2.3.2.

   After that, the Group Manager creates a new group-membership
   resource, accessible to joining nodes and future group members at
   group-oscore/NAME , as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore].  In particular, the Group
   Manager will rely on the current group configuration to build the
   Joining Response message defined in Section 5.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore], when handling the joining of a
   new group member.  Furthermore, the Group Manager generates the
   following pieces of information, and assigns them to the newly
   created OSCORE group:

   o  The OSCORE Master Secret.

   o  The OSCORE Master Salt (optionally).

   o  The OSCORE ID Context, acting as Group ID, which MUST be unique
      within the set of OSCORE groups under the Group Manager.

   Finally, the Group Manager replies to the Administrator with a 2.01
   (Created) response.  The Location-Path option MUST be included in the
   response, indicating the location of the just created group-
   configuration resource.  The response MUST NOT include a Location-
   Query option.

   Example in custom CBOR:

   => 0.02 POST
      Uri-Path: manage
      Content-Format: TBD2 (application/ace-groupcomm+cbor)

        "group_title" : "rooms 1 and 2",
        "as_uri" : "coap://as.example.com/token"
      }

   <= 2.01 Created

2.5.4.  Retrieve a Group Configuration

   The Administrator can send a GET request to the group-configuration
   resource manage/NAME associated to an OSCORE group with group name
   NAME, in order to retrieve the current configuration of that group.

   After a successful processing of the request above, the Group Manager
   replies to the Administrator with a 2.05 (Content) response.  The
   response has as payload the representation of the group configuration
   as specified in Section 2.3.1.  The exact content of the payload
   reflects the current configuration of the OSCORE group.  This
   includes both configuration properties and status properties.

   Example in custom CBOR:

   => 0.01 GET
      Uri-Path: manage
      Uri-Path: gp4

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: TBD2 (application/ace-groupcomm+cbor)

2.5.5.  Update a Group Configuration

   The Administrator can send a PUT request to the group-configuration
   resource associated to an OSCORE group, in order to update the
   current configuration of that group.  The payload of the request has
   the same format of the POST request defined in Section 2.5.3, with
   the exception of the status parameter 'group_name' that MUST NOT be
   included.

   After a successful processing of the request above, the Group Manager
   performs the following actions.

   First, the Group Manager updates the configuration of the OSCORE
   group, consistently with the values indicated in the request from the
   Administrator.  For each configuration parameter not specified in the
   request, the Group Manager MUST use the default value specified in
   Section 2.3.2.  From then on, the Group Manager relies on the latest
   update configuration to build the Join Response message defined in
   Section 5.4 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore], when handling the
   joining of a new group member.

   Then, the Group Manager replies to the Administrator with a 2.04
   (Changed) response.

      alg 11
      hkdf 5

   <= 2.04 Changed

2.5.5.1.  Effects on Joining Nodes

   If the value of the status parameter 'active' is changed from True to
   False, the Group Manager MUST stop admitting new members in the
   group.  In particular, upon receiving a joining request (see
   Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]), the Group
   Manager MUST respond with a 5.03 (Service Unavailable) response to
   the joining node, and MAY include additional information to clarify
   what went wrong.

   If the value of the status parameter 'active' is changed from False
   to True, the Group Manager resumes admitting new members in the
   group, by processing their joining requests (see Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]).

2.5.5.2.  Effects on the Group Members

   After having updated a group configuration, the Group Manager can
   inform the group members by means of the following two methods.  When
   contacting a group member, the Group Manager uses the pairwise secure
   communication channel established with that member during its joining
   process (see Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]).




Tiloca, et al.         Expires September 10, 2020              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft      Admin Interface for the OSCORE GM         March 2020


   o  The Group Manager sends an individual request message to each
      group member, targeting the respective resource used to perform
      the group rekeying process (see Section 16 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]).

   o  A group member may subscribe for updates to the group-membership
      resource of the group (see Section 13 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]), e.g. by using CoAP Observe
      [RFC7641].

   Specifically, the Group Manager takes the following actions,
   depending on the specific updated parameter(s) in the group
   configuration.

   If the value of the status parameter changes, the Group Manager MUST
   inform the group members of the current group status, using one of
   the methods above.

   If any of the configuration parameters is changed, the Group Manager
   MUST provide the new group configuration to the group members, by
   using one of the methods above.  In particular:

   o  The Group Manager uses the same format of the Joining Response
      message in Section 5.4 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore],
      where only the parameters 'gkty', 'key', 'num', 'ace-groupcomm-
      profile' and 'exp' are present.

   o  The content of the Group OSCORE Security Context object within the
      'key' parameter MUST reflect the latest updated group
      configuration.

   o  Although this configuration update does not necessarily require an
      update of the OSCORE Master Secret and ID Context, the Group
      Manager may anyway combine this operation with a full-fledge group
      rekeying (see Section 16 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]).

   Every group member, upon learning from the Group Manager that the
   group has been deactivated, SHOULD stop taking part in communications
   within the OSCORE group.

   Every group member, upon learning from the Group Manager that the
   group has been reactivated, can resume taking part in communications
   within the OSCORE group.

   Every group member, upon receiving updated values for 'alg' and
   'hkdf' within the 'key' parameter of the Group OSCORE Security
   Context object, MUST either:

Internet-Draft      Admin Interface for the OSCORE GM         March 2020


   o  Use them from then on, and accordingly derive a new OSCORE
      Security Context (see Section 3.2.1 of [RFC8613]); or

   o  Simply leave the group (see Section 14 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]), e.g. if not supporting the
      indicated new algorithms.

   Every group member, upon receiving updated values for 'cs_alg',
   'cs_params', 'cs_key_params' and 'cs_key_enc' within the 'key'
   parameter of the Group OSCORE Security Context object, MUST either:

   o  Leave the group and rejoin it (see Section 5 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]), providing the Group Manager
      with a public key which is compatible with the indicated new
      algorithm, parameters and encoding; or

   o  Simply leave the group, e.g. if not supporting the indicated new
      algorithm, parameters and encoding; or

   o  Use them from then on, and, if required, provide the Group Manager
      with a new public key which is compatible with the indicated
      algorithm, parameters and encoding (see Section 10 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]).

2.5.6.  Delete a Group Configuration

   The Administrator can send a DELETE request to the group-
   configuration resource, in order to delete that group.  A group
   deletion would be successful only on an inactive group.

   That is, the DELETE request actually yields a successful deletion of
   the group, only if the corresponding status parameter 'active' has
   current value False.  The administrator can ensure that, by first
   performing an update of the group-configuration resource associated
   to the group (see Section 2.5.5), and setting the corresponding
   status parameter 'active' to False.

   If, upon receiving the DELETE request, the current value of the
   status parameter 'active' is True, the Group Manager MUST respond
   with a 4.09 (Conflict) response, which MAY include additional
   information to clarify what went wrong.

   After a successful processing of the request above, the Group Manager
   performs the following actions.

   First, the Group Manager deletes the OSCORE group and deallocates
   both the group-configuration resource as well as the group-membership
   resource.



Tiloca, et al.         Expires September 10, 2020              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft      Admin Interface for the OSCORE GM         March 2020


   Then, the Group Manager replies to the Administrator with a 2.02
   (Deleted) response.

   Example:

   => DELETE
      Uri-Path: manage
      Uri-Path: gp4

   <= 2.02 Deleted

2.5.6.1.  Effects on the Group Members

   After having deleted a group, the Group Manager can inform the group
   members by means of the following two methods.  When contacting a
   group member, the Group Manager uses the pairwise secure
   communication channel established with that member during its joining
   process (see Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]).

   o  The Group Manager sends an individual request message to each
      group member, targeting the respective resource used to perform
      the group rekeying process (see Section 16 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore]).  The Group Manager uses the
      same format of the Joining Response message in Section 5.4 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore], where only the parameters
      'gkty', 'key', and 'ace-groupcomm-profile' are present, and the
      'key' parameter is empty.

   o  A group member may subscribe for updates to the group-membership
      resource of the group.  In particular, if this relies on CoAP
      Observe [RFC7641], a group member would receive a 4.04 (Not Found)
      notification response from the Group Manager, since the group-
      configuration resource has been deallocated upon deleting the
      group.

   When being informed about the group deletion, a group member deletes
   the OSCORE Security Context that it stores as associated to that
   group, and possibly deallocates any dedicated control resource
   intended for the Group Manager that it has for that group.

3.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are inherited from the ACE framework for
   Authentication and Authorization [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], and from
   the specific transport ace-groupcomm-profile of ACE used between the
   Administrator and the Group Manager, such as
   [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] and [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile].
