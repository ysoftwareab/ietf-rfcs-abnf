Abstract 
 
   Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths 
   (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can 
   help save network resource and useful in scenarios such as LSP 
   recovery or two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time. A 
   Path Computation Element (PCE) is a centralized entity, responsible 
   for path calculation. Given this feature and its access to the 
   network resource information and possibly active LSPs information, 
   it can be used to support resource-sharing-based path computation 
   with better efficiency. 

   This document extends the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) 
   in order to support resource sharing-based path computation.

1. Introduction and Motivation 

   A Path Computation Element (PCE) provides an alternative way for 
   providing path computation function, and it is especially useful in 
   the scenarios where complex constraints and/or a demanding amount of 
   computation resource are required [RFC4655]. The development of PCE 
   standardization has evolved from stateless to stateful. A stateful 
   PCE has access to the LSP database information of the network(s) it 
   serves as a computation engine [Stateful-PCE]. Unless specified 
   otherwise, this document assumes a PCE mentioned is a stateful PCE 
   (either passive or active). 
    
   Resource sharing denotes that two or more Label Switched Paths (LSPs) 
   share common piece(s) of resource, (such as a common time slot of a 
   link in an Optical Transport Network (OTN)). This is usually useful 
   in the scenario where only one LSP is active and the benefit herein 
   is to save network resources. A simple example of this is 
   dynamically calculating a LSP for an existing LSP undergoing a link 
   failure. Note that the resource sharing can be worked out using a 
   statelss PCE, but the mechanism may be complex and is out the scope 
   of this draft.  
    
   This document considers the following requirement: resource sharing 
   with one or multiple existing LSPs. In a single domain, this is a 
   common requirement in the recovery cases especially in order to 
   increase traffic resilience against failure while reducing the amount 
   of network resource used for recovery purpose [RFC4428].  
    
   The current protocol supporting the communication between a PCE and 
   a Path Computation Client (PCC), i.e. PCE Protocol (PCEP), allows 
   for re-optimization of an existing LSP [RFC5440]. This is achieved 
   by setting R bit in the Request Parameter (RP) object, together with 
   some additional information if applicable, in the Path Computation 
   Request (PCReq) message sent from a PCC to the PCE. To support this 
   type of resource sharing, a PCC needs to ask a PCE to compute a new 
   path with the constraints of sharing resource with one or multiple 
   existing LSPs. Current PCEP specifications do not provide such 
   function.  
    
   As mentioned in [stateful-PCE], the standardization of stateful PCEs 
   also facilitates PCEP to meet this requirement since a LSP can be 
   identified using a unique number. This simplifies configuration of 
   PCCs by making it simpler to for a PCC to request resource sharing 
   without having to determine all of the resources to be shared.

   The resource sharing can also be required across layers. This is 
   similar to the previous requirement. However, it is more complex and 
   therefore deserves a more detailed explanation here.  
    
   In a multi-layer network, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in a lower 
   layer are used to carry higher-layer LSPs across the lower-layer 
   network [RFC5623]. Therefore, the resource sharing constraints in 
   the higher layer might actually relate to the resource sharing in 
   the lower layer. Thus, it is useful to consider how this can be 
   achieved and whether additional extensions are needed using the 
   models defined in [RFC5623]. 
    
   In the next sections, use cases are provided to show what 
   information needs to be exchanged to fulfill these requirements. 
   This memo then provides extensions to PCEP to enable this function.  
    
2. Motivation 

2.1. Use Case 1 

   Figure 1 shows a single domain network with a stateful PCE. Assume a 
   working LSP (N1-N2-N3) exists in the network. When there is failure 
   on the link N2-N3, it is desired to set up a restoration path for 
   this working LSP. Suppose N1 serves as the PCC and sends a request 
   to the stateful PCE for such an LSP. Before sending the request, N1 
   may need to check what policy is configured locally on N1. For 
   example, it might value resource sharing more than effectiveness. 
   Effectiveness here denotes whether the traffic can be diverted back 
   to the working LSP immediately once the failure on the working LSP 
   is repaired. In this case, it would prefer to share as much resource 
   with the working LSP as possible and specify this in the PCReq 
   message.  
    
   On the other hand, if N1 considers effectiveness more important, it 
   would prefer to share as few resources as possible. Note this is 
   different from path diversity, since diversity is a much stricter 
   requirement and it would cause path computation failure if the 
   diverse recovery path cannot be found. A simple illustration is 
   provided below:

   Available recovery paths computed by the stateful PCE: 
    
   LSP1: N1-N2-N4-N3 
   LSP2: N1-N5-N4-N3 
    
   If resource sharing is preferred, the stateful PCE will reply with 
   LSP1 information. Instead, if effectiveness is valued higher, it 
   will reply with LSP2 information.  
    
   Another piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the PCE is 
   the information about the working path LSP. Note this simple use 
   case assumes end-to-end recovery. But in order to be applicable to 
   use cases such as shared mesh protection purpose, where the head-end 
   and tail-end nodes may be different, this information is necessary 
   in the message exchange between PCCs and PCEs, so that the stateful 
   PCE knows which LSP the path computation request wants to share the 
   resource with. 
              
2.2. Use Case 2 

   Figure 2 shows a two-layer network example, with each layer managed 
   by a PCE (referred as PCE Hi for higher layer and PCE Lo for lower 
   layer later). As Discussed in Section 3 of [RFC5623], there are 
   three models for inter-layer path computation. They are single PCE 
   computation, multiple PCE with inter-PCE communication and multiple 
   PCE without inter-PCE communication, respectively. For the single

   PCE computation, the process would be similar to that of the use 
   case in Section 2.1. Thus, this model is not discussed further.

               Figure 2: A Two-layer Network Example 
                
   In this example, assume a LSP (LSP1: H2-H3) has been established 
   already. A new request comes at H2 to establish a new LSP (LSP2: 
   from H2 to H5), given the constraint it can share resource with LSP1. 
   This requirement is possible if only one of the LSPs needs to be 
   active and resource sharing is the target. 
    
   If multiple PCE with inter-PCE communication model is employed, the 
   path computation request sent by H2 to PCE Hi will be passed to PCE 
   Lo since there is no resource readily available in the upper layer. 
   So it leaves to the PCE Lo to compute a path in the lower layer in 
   order to support the upper layer request. In this case, PCE Lo is 
   required to compute a path between H2 and H5 under the constraint 
   that it can share the resource with that of the LSP1. Assume here 
   LSP1 goes from H2, via L1-L2 to H3. So when PCE Lo computes the path 
   for LSP2, it can view the resource used by LSP1 available. For 
   example, PCE Lo may choose H2-L1-L2-L4-H5 as the computation result.

draft-zhang-pce-resource-sharing-00.txt                   February 2014 


   The issue to solve during this procedure is that PCE Hi can only use 
   LSP1 information (such as its five-tuple LSP information) as the 
   information, how PCE Lo can resolve this information to the actual 
   resource usage in its own layer, i.e. lower layer. This could be 
   solved by edge LSR L1 reporting this higher-lower layer LSP 
   correlation to the Lo PCE as part of the LSP information during the 
   LSP state synchronization process. If needed, it can be later 
   updated when there is a change in this information. Alternatively, 
   the PCE Lo can get this information from other sources, such as 
   network management system, where this information should be stored. 
    
    
   If multiple PCE without inter-PCE communication model is employed, 
   the path computation request in the lower layer will be initiated 
   the border LSR node, i.e., L1. The process would be similar to that 
   of the previous scenario. A point worth noting is that the border 
   LSR node may be able to resolve the higher LSP information itself, 
   such as mapping it to the corresponding LSP in the lower layer, thus 
   PCE Lo do not need to perform this function. Otherwise, the method 
   mentioned above can still be used.  
    
3. Extensions to PCEP 

   This section provides PCEP extensions to allow a PCC to specify 
   resource sharing when sending a PCReq message. It also details the 
   processing rule and error codes needed. 

3.1. Resource Sharing Object 

   The PCEP Resource Sharing Object (RSO) is optional. It MAY be 
   carried within a PCRep message so as to indicate the desired 
   resource sharing requirements to be applied by the stateful PCE 
   during path computation. 

   The RSO object format is compliant with the PCEP object format 
   defined in [RFC5440]. 

   The RSO Object-Class is TBA. 

   The RSO Object-type is 1.  

   The format of the RSO object body is:

3.2. Processing Rules 

   To request a path allowing sharing resource with one or multiple 
   existing LSPs, a PCC includes a RSO object in the PCReq message. 

   On receipt of a PCReq message with a RSO object, a stateful PCE MUST 
   proceed as follows: 

     - If the RSO object is unknown/unsupported, the PCE will follow 
     procedures defined in [RFC5440].  That is, the PCE sends a PCErr 
     message with error type 3 or 4 (Unknown / Not supported object) 
     and error value 1 or 2 (unknown / unsupported object class / 
     object type), and the related path computation request is 
     discarded.

draft-zhang-pce-resource-sharing-00.txt                   February 2014 


     - If TLV(s) present in the RSO object are unknown/unsupported and 
     the P bit is set, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with error 
     type 3 or 4 (Unknown / Not supported object) and error value 4     
     (Unrecognized/Unsupported parameter), and the related path     
     computation request MUST be discarded as defined in [RFC5440]. 

     - If the resource sharing information is extracted correctly, the 
     PCE MUST apply the requested resource sharing requirement.   

   If the received RSO has D bit set, the PCE will find a path that 
   shares as much resources as possible with the specified LSP(s). 
   Otherwise, if S bit is set, the PCE will find a path that shares as 
   little resources as possible with the specified LSP(s). The RSO 
   codes may be locally configured on the requesting nodes via external 
   entities, such as a network management system or the entity that 
   impose the resource sharing requirement.  

3.3. Carrying RSO in a PCEP Message 

   The RSO is applied to an individual path computation request and the 
   format of the PCReq message is updated as follows: 

   <PCReq Message> ::= <Common Header> 

                       [<svec-list>] 

                       <request-list> 

   where: 

        <svec-list> ::= <SVEC> 

                        [<OF>] 

                        [<metric-list>] 

                        [<svec-list>] 

    

       <request-list> ::= <request> [<request-list>] 

    

       <request> ::= <RP> 

                     <END-POINTS>

                     [<BANDWIDTH>] 

                     [<metric-list>] 

                     [<OF>] 

                     [<RRO>[<BANDWIDTH>]] 

                     [<IRO>] 

                     [<RSO>]    

                     [<LOAD-BALANCING>] 

   and where: 

      <metric-list> ::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>] 

4. Security Considerations 

   Security of PCEP is discussed in [RFC5440] and [RFC6952]. The 
   extensions in this document do not change the fundamentals of 
   security for PCEP. 

   However, the introduction of the RSO provides a vector that may be 
   used to probe for information from a network. For example, a PCC 
   that wants to discover the path of an LSP with which it is not 
   involved, can issue a PCReq with an RSO and may be able to get back 
   quite a lot of information about the path of the LSP through issuing 
   multiple such requests for different endpoints and analyzing the 
   received results. To protect against this, a PCE should be 
   configured with access and authorization controls such that only 
   authorized PCCs (for example, those within the network) can make 
   computation requests, only specifically authorized PCCs can make 
   requests using the RSO, and resource sharing requests relating to 
   specific LSPs are further limited to a select few PCCs. How such 
   access controls and authorization is managed is outside the scope of 
   this document, but it will at the least include Access Control Lists. 

   Furthermore, a PCC must be aware that setting up an LSP that shares 
   resources with another LSP may be a way of attacking the other LSP, 
   for example by depriving it of the resources it needs to operate 
   correctly. Thus it is important that, both in PCEP and the 
   associated signaling protocols, only authorized resource sharing is 
   allowed.

5. IANA Considerations 

5.1. New Object Type 

   IANA manages the PCEP Objects code point registry (see [RFC5440]).   
   This is maintained as the "PCEP Objects" sub-registry of the "Path   
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry. 

   This document defines a new PCEP object, the RSO object, to be 
   carried in PCReq messages.  IANA is requested to make the following 
   allocation in the "PCEP Objects" sub-registry: 

   Object    Name     Object    Name                  Reference 
   Class              Type 
   ------------------------------------------------------------ 

    TBA      RSO              Resource Sharing     [this document]  

   5.2 New RSO TLVs 

   IANA is request to create and maintain a new sub-registry named "RSO 
   TLVs" and include the following TLVs: 

   Value        Description              Reference 

     1         IPv4 LSP Info TLV          [this document] 

     2         IPv6 LSP Info TLV          [this document] 

   5.3 RSO codes 

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a new sub-registry named 
   "RSO codes". The following codes are defined in this document: 

   Bit      Code Name      Meaning                    Reference 

    0           D          sharing as much as possible 

                                                   [this document] 

    1           R          sharing as little as possible 

                                                   [this document]
