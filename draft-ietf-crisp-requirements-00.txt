Internet-Draft             crisp-requirements                  July 2002


1. Background

   The expansion and growth of the Internet has seen the registry
   function of a traditionally centralized and managed Network
   Information Center become the responsibility of various autonomous,
   functionally disparate, and globally distributed Internet
   registries. With the broadening number of Internet registries, the
   uses of their administrative directory services have expanded from
   the original and traditional use of the whois[4] protocol to include
   the use of whois outside the scope of its specification, formal and
   informal definitions of syntax, undocumented security mechanisms,
   the use of other protocols, such as rwhois[3], to fulfill other
   needs, and proposals for the use of other technologies such as
   LDAP[1] and XML.

   The scope of the requirements captured in this document relate to
   the directory services of Internet registries and their related
   communities (Section 2.3,Section 2.4, and Section 2.5). This scoping
   specifically targets the requirements of domain name registries
   (Section 2.1) while acknowledging extensibility needs for possible
   future support of the requirements for other registry (Section 2.2)
   types. The requirements are of both the current use of these
   directory services and the desired functionality based on input from
   relevant forums (Appendix B.1). These requirements are not specific
   to any protocol. Terms used in the definition of requirements in
   this document may be found in the glossary (Appendix A).

   The requirements captured in this document are for the purpose of
   designing technical specifications. The words used in this document
   for compliance with RFC2119[8] do not reference or specify policy
   and speak only to the capabilities in the derived technology. The
   scope of the requirements in this document are also restricted to
   access of data from Internet registries. Requirements for
   modification, addition, or provisioning of data in Internet
   registries are out of scope.

2. Internet Registry Communities

   The Internet registries are composed of various communities which
   provide scope for the requirements in this document. These
   communities can be generalized into the following categories:
   registries, registrars, implementers, end-users, and other actors.

2.1 Domain Name System Registries

2.1.1 Domain Registries

   Domain registries are responsible for the registration of domains
   for use with DNS[2] and forward lookups (i.e. does not include the
   IN-ADDR.ARPA or IP6.ARPA domains). These registries have typically
   served two main domain functions: as the registry for a gTLD or as a
   registry for a ccTLD. In some instances, one entity will operate
   multiple TLD's, both of the gTLD and ccTLD type. A gTLD or ccTLD
   domain registry operator may be a governmental entity,
   non-governmental, non-commercial entity, or a commercial entity.

   Some ccTLD's have second-level domain registrations similar in
   nature to gTLD's or have distinctly separate entities operating
   second-level domain registries similar in nature to gTLD's within
   the ccTLD.

   Domain registries usually follow one of two models for conducting
   registrations of domains. The "thick" model is the more traditional
   model. In a "thick" domain registry, the registry contains both the
   operational data for the domain and the contact or social data
   (Appendix A) for the domain. In this model, the registry is
   typically the interface to the domain registrant but may also
   interface with the domain registrant through domain registrars. The
   "thin" model domain registry contains only operational data for
   domains. In the "thin" model, contact or social data for the domain
   are maintained by a domain registrar.

   Domain registries not described in this section (Section 2.1.1) are
   not the subject of this document and may have requirements that are
   out of scope for this subject matter.

2.1.2 Domain Registrars

   Domain registrars accept domain registrations from registrants on
   behalf of domain registries, both "thick" and "thin". In a "thin"
   model registry/registrar system, a domain registrar maintains the
   contact and social data of a domain while the registry maintains the
   operational data of a domain. In a "thick" model registry/registrar
   system, a domain registrar passes both the operational data and
   contact data to the registry. Domain registrars may register a

Internet-Draft             crisp-requirements                  July 2002


   domain on behalf of a registrant in more than one domain registry.

2.2 Other Registries

2.2.1 Regional Internet Registries

   Regional Internet Registries (RIR's) administer the allocation of IP
   address space and autonomous system numbers. Each RIR serves a
   specific geographic region, and collectively they service the entire
   Internet. Each RIR is a membership-based, non-profit organization
   that facilitates and implements global addressing policy based on
   the direction of their regional community. 

2.2.2 Local Internet Registries

   Local Internet Registries (LIR's) and National Internet Registries
   (NIR's) are sub-registries of RIR's and coordinate the same
   functions of the RIR's for smaller, more specific geographic
   regions, sovereign nations, and localities.

2.2.3 Internet Routing Registries

   Internet Routing Registries are routing policy databases. Their
   purpose is to provide information helpful in administering Internet
   routers. Frequently, the syntax and contents are defined by RPSL[5]. 

   IRR's are operated by academic, commercial, governmental, and other
   types of organizations, including several of the RIR's. The contents
   of the databases vary and reflect the needs of the users directly
   served (e.g. an ISP may look up route entries added by their
   customers to decide whether to accept specific route advertisements
   they receive). 

   Unlike RIR and domain registry data, IRR data is often duplicated
   between separate organizations. The IRR data has the unique
   characteristics of being largely available through other sources
   (i.e. it is advertised by the Internet routing protocols) and most
   often having a common data format, RPSL. 

2.2.4 Incident Coordination Contact Registries

   Incident coordination contact registries allow operators of network
   resources such as network infrastructure, network names, or network
   services to register contact information for the purpose of
   providing a means of incident notification. Using this type of
   registry, an operators of network resources are provided information
   for contacting the operator of another network resource from which
   an incident may be occurring.

Internet-Draft             crisp-requirements                  July 2002


2.2.5 Network Edge Resource Registries

   Network edge resource registries provide specific information about
   "edge" resources. They are administered by the operators of the
   resources. Examples of such registries are rwhois[3] servers
   operated by networks to describe the assignment of address space
   allocated by RIR's or LIR's and whois[4] servers operated by
   networks to specifically announce routing policy of that network.

2.3 Implementers

   Implementers of client software are often either affiliated with
   large network operators, registry operators, or commercial entities
   offering value-added services, or are general citizens of the
   Internet. Much of the client software for use with the directory
   services of Internet registries is either freely available, open
   source, or both, or available as a service. Implementers of server
   software are often affiliated with operators or commercial entities
   specializing in the out-sourcing of development for Internet
   registries.

2.4 End Users

2.4.1 Service Providers and Network Operators

   Service providers and network operators provide connectivity,
   routing, and naming services to many other entities, some commercial
   and some non-commercial, both large and small. Their operational and
   administrative staff often interact with Internet registries on
   behalf of other end-users. Service providers and network operators
   interact with all of the Internet registry operators outlined in
   this document on a frequent and consistent basis. For example,
   network operators use the directory services of Internet registries
   to determine contact information for network resources that have
   technical problems.

2.4.2 Intellectual Property Holders

   Intellectual Property Holders have legal rights to the use of domain
   names based on copyright and trademark laws of various governments.
   They use the directory services of Internet registries, mostly
   domain registries and registrars, for purposes of maintaining and
   defending claims to domain names consistent with applicable laws and
   regulations.

2.4.3 Law Enforcement

   Law enforcement agencies use the directory services of Internet
   registries to find information used to carry out the enforcement of

Internet-Draft             crisp-requirements                  July 2002


   laws within their jurisdictions.

2.4.4 Certificate Authorities

   Certificate authorities use the directory services of Internet
   registries as part of their verification process when issuing
   certificates for Internet named hosts.

2.4.5 DNS Users

   Users of the Internet have client software that resolves domain
   names to IP addresses. Often when trouble occurs in the resolution
   process of DNS, these users trouble shoot system problems with the
   aid of information from the directory services of Internet
   registries.

2.4.6 Domain Registrants

   Entities given authority over a domain via purchase, lease, or grant
   from a domain registry, either directly or via the services of a
   domain registrar.

2.5 Other Actors

   Requirements must also consider the positions and policies of other
   actors on the use of Internet registry directory services by other
   actors. These actors include governments, non-governmental
   policy-setting bodies, and other non-governmental organizations.

3. Functional Requirements

   Functional requirements describe an overall need or process for
   which the directory service is used by an Internet registry to
   fulfill its obligations to provide access to its respective
   customers, members, or other constituents. This section makes
   reference to terms and definitions declared in Appendix A. This
   section makes use of the term "service" to denote the set of
   functions to be provided by, and the expected behavior of, software
   built to meet these requirements in one or more protocols.

   These requirements are for the purpose of designing a technical
   specification. The words used in this section are for compliance
   with RFC2119[8], do not reference or specify policy, and speak only
   to the capabilities in the derived technology.

3.1 Base Functions

   This section describes basic service requirements for an Internet
   registry service for any of the registries (domain name registries
   (Section 2.1) and other registries (Section 2.2)). Additional
   requirements, specific to domain registries, are described in Domain
   Specific Functions (Section 3.2).

3.1.1 Mining Prevention

   The service MUST have a mechanism to limit the amount of data that
   may be accessed. The service MAY have different limits for different
   types of data, as well as for authenticated and non-authenticated
   entities. The service SHOULD be capable of expressing to the client
   these access limitations based on queries per session per unit of
   time, queries per source IP address per unit of time, and total
   queries from all client sessions per unit of time. The service
   SHOULD be able to limit the amount of data based on the above types
   of limitations.

3.1.2 Minimal Technical Reinvention

   The service MUST NOT employ unique technology solutions for all
   aspects and layers above the network and transport layers of the
   total service solution and SHOULD make use of existing technology
   standards where applicable. The service MUST employ the use of
   network and transport layer standards as defined by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force. The service MUST define one or more
   transport mechanisms for mandatory implementation.

3.1.3 Standard and Extensible Schemas

   The service MUST define standard schemas for the exchange of data


Newton                  Expires January 29, 2003                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             crisp-requirements                  July 2002


   needed to implement the functionality in this document. In addition,
   there MUST be a means to allow the use of schemas not defined by the
   needs of this document. Both types of schemas MUST use the same
   schema language.

3.1.4 Level of Access

   The service MUST allow the classification of data as being either
   privileged or non-privileged, for the purpose of restricting access
   to privileged data. Note that this requirement makes no assumption
   or prescription as to what data (social or operational) might be
   considered privileged, but merely provides the ability to make the
   classification as necessary.

   The service MUST be capable of serving both privileged and
   non-privileged data.

   The service MUST be capable of authenticating privileged entities
   and ensuring that only those entities have access to both privileged
   and non-privileged data.

   The service MUST be capable of providing access to non-privileged
   data without requiring authentication of any type (i.e. anonymous
   access).

3.1.5 Client Processing

   The service MUST be capable of allowing machine parsable requests
   and responses.

3.1.6 Entity Referencing

   There MUST be a mechanism for an entity contained within a server to
   be referenced uniquely by an entry in another server.

3.1.7 Decentralization

   The service MUST be decentralized in design and principle and MUST
   NOT require the aggregation of data to a central repository, server,
   or entity. The service MAY allow for the optional aggregation of
   data indexes or hints. The service MUST NOT require aggregation of
   data indexes or hints.

3.1.8 Query of Access Levels

   If a query cannot yield a valid response due to insufficient
   permissions, the service MUST provide the client with an error
   response indicating this condition. The service SHOULD NOT provide a
   mechanism allowing a client to determine if a query will be denied


Newton                  Expires January 29, 2003               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             crisp-requirements                  July 2002


   before the query is submitted.

   It is the intent of this requirement for clients to learn of
   inadequate permission status for a query only after the query has
   been submitted. Operating modes allowing a client to predetermine
   the queries that will or will not be denied are not encouraged for
   security considerations.

3.2 Domain Specific Functions

   These functions describe requirements specifically needed by domain
   registries (Section 2.1.1) and domain registrars (Section 2.1.2).
   Requirements specific to other registries (Section 2.2) MUST be
   specified separately. No compliant service entity is required to
   support the functions required by every registry type.

3.2.1 Contact Lookup

   The service MUST allow access to social data of contact entities
   given a unique reference to the contact entity.

3.2.2 Nameserver Lookup

   The service MUST allow access to operational and social data of a
   nameserver given the fully-qualified host name or IP address of a
   nameserver.

3.2.3 Domain Status Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to the status of a domain given the
   domain's fully qualified name. This status MUST indicate the
   activation status of the domain. The activation status is the same
   as would be available in Section 3.2.5.

3.2.4 Domain Registrant Search

   The service MUST provide the capability of searching for registrants
   by exact name match or a reasonable name subset. The service MAY
   provide limits to the number of results from this search to
   alleviate performance or comply with Section 3.1.1. If the service
   limits the number of results from this search to alleviate
   performance, it MUST provide the client with a response indicating
   this condition. If the service limits the number of results from
   this search to comply with Section 3.1.1, it MUST NOT provide the
   client with a response indicating this condition.

   The service MUST provide a mechanism to distribute this search
   across all applicable domain registries and registrars. The service
   SHOULD have a means to narrow the scope of a search to a specific

   TLD. The service MUST be able to specify to the client an empty
   result set should the search yield no results.

3.2.5 Domain Information Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to operational and social data
   specific to a domain given the domain's fully qualified name (FQDN).
   This information SHOULD include the following:

   o  activation status

   o  registrant name and contact data

   o  hosting nameservers

   o  technical, billing or other entity types associate with the
      domain and their relevant contact data, if any exist

   o  the name of or a reference to the registry delegating the domain

   o  the name of or a reference to the registrar for the domain, if
      one exists

3.2.6 Nameserver Search

   The service MAY allow the ability to list all domains hosted by a
   specific nameserver given the fully-qualified host name or IP
   address, if applicable, of the nameserver. The service MAY provide a
   mechanism to distribute this search across all applicable domain
   registries and registrars.

3.2.7 Escrow Support

   The service MUST provide a means to escrow data of domain registrars
   to an escrow entity using a common schema. This escrow capability
   SHOULD be "off-line" and "out-of-band" from the normal operations of
   the service.

3.2.8 Authentication Distribution

   The service MUST be capable of allowing a centralized authority
   entity the means to distribute authentication information of
   entities accessing the service. The service MUST not require all
   Internet registries to participate in distributed authentication and
   SHOULD allow the participation by an Internet registry in
   distributed authentication by many centralized authority entities.

3.2.9 Domain Name Search

   The service MUST allow searching for domains by exact name match or
   a reasonable subset of a domain name. The service MAY provide limits
   to the number of results from this search to alleviate performance
   or comply with Section 3.1.1. If the service limits the number of
   results from this search to alleviate performance, it MUST provide
   the client with a response indicating this condition. If the service
   limits the number of results from this search to comply with Section
   3.1.1, it MUST NOT provide the client with a response indicating
   this condition.

   The service MUST provide a mechanism to distribute this search
   across all applicable domain registries and registrars. There should
   be a means to narrow this search based on a TLD. 

   The search mechanism SHOULD provide for differences in domain names
   between the native representation and the canonical form existing in
   the registry.

3.2.10 DNS Label Referencing

   The service MUST use DNS[2] to determine the authoritative source of
   information about domain names. It is the intention of this
   requirement that a client be able to determine via DNS and query the
   servers or set of servers of the domain registry delegating the
   domain name, the domain registrar responsible for registering the
   domain name if one is applicable, and the domain registrant of the
   domain name. The service SHOULD provide procedures or mechanisms to
   allow this determination if it cannot be done using DNS.

3.2.11 Distribution for Domain Registry Types

   The service MUST allow for the various registration distribution
   models of domain registry types described in Section 2.1.1 while
   complying with Section 3.1.7.

4. Feature Requirements

   Feature requirements describe the perceived need derived from the
   functional requirements for specific technical criteria of the
   directory service. This section makes references to terms and
   definitions declared in Appendix A . This section uses the term
   "service" to denote the set of features to be provided by, and the
   expected behavior of, software built to meet these requirements in
   one or more protocols.

   These requirements are for the purpose of designing a technical
   specification. The words used in this section are for compliance
   with RFC2119[8], do not reference or specify policy, and speak only
   to the capabilities in the derived technology.

4.1 Client Authentication

   Entities accessing the service (users) MUST be provided a mechanism
   for passing credentials to a server for the purpose of
   authentication.

4.2 Referrals

   To distribute queries for search continuations and to issue entity
   references, the service MUST provide a referral mechanism.

4.3 Common Referral Mechanism

   To distribute queries for search continuation and to issue entity
   references, the service MUST define a common referral scheme and
   syntax.

4.4 Structured Queries and Responses

   To provide for machine consumption as well as human consumption, the
   service MUST employ structured queries and responses.

4.5 Existing Schema Language

   To provide structured queries and responses and allow for minimal
   technological reinvention, the service MUST employ a pre-existing
   schema language.

4.6 Defined Schemas

   To provide for machine consumption as well as human consumption, the
   service MUST define schemas for use by the structured queries and
   responses.

4.7 Serialization Definition

   To provide for data escrow and allow for minimal technological
   reinvention, the service MUST employ a pre-existing serialization
   specification.

5. Internationalization Considerations

   Requirements defined in this document MUST consider the best
   practices spelled out in [6].

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA consideration for any service meeting these requirements will
   depend upon the technologies chosen and MUST be specified by any
   document describing such a service.

7. Security Considerations

   This document contains requirements for the validation of
   authenticated entities and the access of authenticated entities
   compared with the access of non-authenticated entities. This
   document does not define the mechanism for validation of
   authenticated entities. Requirements defined in this document MUST
   allow for the implementation of this mechanism according best common
   practices.

   The requirement in Section 3.1.4 must be weighed against other
   requirements specifying search or lookup capabilities.

   In addition, this document contains requirements for referrals and
   entity references. Client implementations based on these
   requirements SHOULD take proper care in the safe-guarding of
   credential information when resolving referrals or entity references
   according to best common practices.

   o  mining: In the context of this document, this term is specific to
      data mining. This is a methodical process to obtain the contents
      of directory service, usually as much as possible, not relevant
      to any immediate need. Data mining is often not a practice
      welcomed by registry operators.
