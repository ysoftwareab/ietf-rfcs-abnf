Abstract

   This document describes a general and flexible TLV (type-length-value
   structure) for representing cryptographic signatures as well as
   timestamps, using the generalized MANET packet/message format
   [RFC5444].  It defines two Message TLVs and two Packet TLVs, for
   affixing a cryptographic signature and a timestamp to a packet and
   message, respectively.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document:

   o  specifies two TLVs for carrying cryptographic signatures and
      timestamps in packets and messages as defined by [RFC5444],

   o  requests IANA allocations for these Packet and Message TLVs from
      the 0-127 Message TLV range and the 0-223 Packet TLV range from
      [RFC5444],

   o  describes how cryptographic signatures are calculated, taking into
      account the mutable message header fields (<msg-hop-limit> and
      <msg-hop-count>) for messages where these fields are present,

   o  requests creation of two IANA registries for recording code points
      for hash function and signature calculation, respectively.

   This document does not stipulate how to sign, validate, or encrypt
   messages.  A specification of a routing protocol or routing protocol
   extension, using the security representation of this document, MUST
   specify appropriate interpretation of the TLVs.  This document does
   specifically not suggest specific cryptographic algorithms or hash
   functions, but rather establishes IANA registries for such.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology and notation defined in [RFC5444].
   Additionally, it defines the following terminology:

   o  Hash-Function

         A hash function is an algorithm that takes a message of any
         length as input and produces a fixed-length string as output.
         Hash functions are used in cryptography for authentication and
         message integrity.

   o  Signature:

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


         An electronic signature authenticates the signer (who often is
         the originator) of a message.  In addition, it can be verified
         whether the message has been changed after it has been signed.
         In many cases, a signature is calculated by encrypting a hash
         of a message, whis is the basic assumption of this document.

   o  Timestamp

         The timestamp indicates the time when the timestamp has been
         created.  If a timestamp is added to a message before signing
         the message, this information can be useful to determine the
         "freshness" of the signed message.  "Old" messages can indicate
         replayed messages.


3.  Applicability Statement

   The packet and message format defined in [RFC5444] accords MANET
   routing protocols using this format the ability to carry additional
   information in control messages, through inclusion of TLVs.
   Information so included in a control message MAY be used by the
   routing protocol, or an extension of the routing protocol, according
   to its specification.

   This document specifies how to include a cryptographic signature for
   a packet or message by way of TLVs, as specified in [RFC5444].  This
   document also specifies how to treat "mutable" fields (<msg-hop-
   count> and <msg-hop-limit>) in the message header when calculating
   the signature, such that the resulting signature can be correctly
   verified by any recipient, and how to include this signature.  A
   MANET routing protocol, or an extension of a MANET routing protocol,
   MAY use such included cryptographic signatures for, for example,
   rejecting messages where signature verification fails.

   Basic MANET routing protocol specifications are often "oblivious to
   security", however have a clause allowing a control message to be
   rejected as "badly formed" prior to it being processed or forwarded.
   Protocols such as [NHDP] recognize external reasons (such as failure
   to verify a signature) as being reasons for rejecting a message as
   "badly formed" and therefore "invalid for processing".  This
   architecture is a result of the observation that with respect to
   security in MANETs, "one size rarely fits all" and that MANET routing
   protocol deployment domains have varying security requirements
   ranging from "unbreakable" to "virtually none".  The virtue of this
   approach is that MANET routing protocol specifications (and
   implementations) can remain "generic", with extensions providing
   proper deployment-domain specific security mechanisms.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


   The MANET routing protocol "security architecture", in which this
   specification situates itself, can therefore be summarized as
   follows:

   o  Security-oblivious MANET routing protocol specification, with a
      clause allowing an extension to reject a message (prior to
      processing/forwarding) as "badly formed".

   o  MANET routing protocol security extensions, rejecting messages as
      "badly formed", as appropriate for a given deployment-domain.

   o  Code-points and an exchange format for information necessary for
      specification of such security extensions.

   This document addresses the last of these issues, by specifying a
   common exchange format for cryptographic signatures.  This document
   also makes reservations from within the Message TLV and Packet TLV
   registries of [RFC5444], to be used (and shared) among MANET routing
   protocol security extensions.  Finally, this document establishes two
   IANA registries for code-points for hash functions and cryptographic
   functions for use by protocols adhering to [RFC5444].

   With respect to [RFC5444], this document:

   o  is intended to be used in the non-normative but intended mode of
      use of [RFC5444] as described in its Appendix B.

   o  is a specific example of the Security Considerations section of
      [RFC5444] (the authentication part).


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This specification does not describe a protocol, nor does it mandate
   specific router or protocol behavior.  It represents a purely
   syntactical representation of security related information for use
   with [RFC5444] messages and packets, as well as sets up IANA
   registrations and registries.


5.  General Signature TLV Structure

   The following data structure allows the representation of a
   cryptographic signature, including specification of the appropriate
   hash function and cryptographic algorithm used for calculating the
   signature.  This <signature> data structure is specified, using the
   regular expression syntax of [RFC5444], as:




Herberg & Clausen       Expires January 28, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


             <signature> := <hash-function>
                            <cryptographic-algorithm>
                            <signature-value>

   where:

   <hash-function>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the
      hash function according to Table 3.

   <cryptographic-algorithm>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field
      specifying the cryptographic function according to Table 4.

   <signature-value>  is an unsigned integer field, whose length is
      <tlv-length>-2, and which contains the cryptographic signature.

   The basic version of this TLV assumes that calculating the signature
   can be decomposed into:

      signature-value = cryptographic-function(hash-function(message))

   with cryptographic-function and hash-function being selected from
   Table 3 and Table 4 respectively (where either of them can be the
   identity function -- indicated by "none" in the registry).  The type
   extension 0 is assumed to indicate this decomposition.  Otherwise, if
   a signature is not decomposable in that way, the type extension field
   can be used for indication how signatures are to be calculated.

   The algorithm that is used for calculating the hash function is
   selected from one of those listed in Table 3.  Furthermore, <hash-
   function> corresponds to the number in that table assigned by IANA.

   The algorithm that is used for calculating the cryptographic
   algorithm is selected from one of those listed in Table 4.
   Furthermore, <cryptographic-algorithm> corresponds to the number in
   that table assigned by IANA.  If the selected hash function is "none"
   (0), the cryptographic function SHOULD NOT be "none" (0).

   The rationale for separating the hash function and the cryptographic
   function into two octets instead of having all combinations in a
   single octet -- possibly as TLV type extension -- is twofold: First,
   if further hash or cryptographic functions are added in the future,
   the number space might not be continuous any more.  More importantly,
   the number space of 256 possible combinations is rapidly exhausted.
   For example, having only 16 different hash functions and 16 different
   cryptographic functions would lead to exhaustion.  As new or improved
   cryptographic mechanism are continuously being developed and
   introduced, this format should be able to accommodate such for the
   foreseeable future.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


   The rationale for not including a field that lists parameters of the
   cryptographic signature in the TLV is the following: Before being
   able to to validate a cryptographic signature, routers have to
   exchange keys (e.g. public keys).  Any additional parameters can be
   exchanged together with the keys in this bootstrap process.  It is
   therefore not necessary, and would even entail an extra overhead, to
   transmit the parameters within every message.  One inherently
   included parameter is the length of the signature, which is tlv-
   length - 2 and which depends on the choice of the cryptographic
   function.


6.  General Timestamp TLV Structure

   The following data structure allows the representation of a
   timestamp.  This <timestamp> data structure is specified as:

          <timestamp> := <time-value>

   where:

   <time-value>  is an unsigned integer field, whose length is <tlv-
      length>, and which contains the timestamp.  The value of this
      variable is to be interpreted by the routing protocol as specified
      by the type extension of the Timestamp TLV (refer to Table 2).

   A timestamp is essentially "freshness information".  As such, its
   setting and interpretation is to be determined by the routing
   protocol (or the extension to a routing protocol) that uses it, and
   may e.g. correspond to a UNIX-timestamp, GPS timestamp or a simple
   sequence number.  This is out of the scope of this specification.


7.  Message TLVs

   Two Message TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a message, and for including the timestamp indicating
   the time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

7.1.  Message SIGNATURE TLV

   A Message SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a SIGNATURE TLV as described
   in Section 5.  When determining the <signature-value> for a message,
   the signature is calculated over the entire message with the
   following considerations:

   o  the fields <msg-hop-limit> and <msg-hop-count> MUST be both
      assumed to have the value 0 (zero).



Herberg & Clausen       Expires January 28, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


   o  all Message SIGNATURE TLVs MUST be removed before calculating the
      signature, and the message size as well as the Message TLV block
      size MUST be recalculated accordingly.  The TLVs can be restored
      after having calculated the signature value.

7.2.  Message TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Message TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a TIMESTAMP TLV as described
   in Section 6.  If a message contains a TIMESTAMP TLV and a SIGNATURE
   TLV, the TIMESTAMP TLV SHOULD be added first to the message, in order
   to include it in the calculation of the signature.


8.  Packet TLVs

   Two Packet TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a packet, and for including the timestamp indicating the
   time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

8.1.  Packet SIGNATURE TLV

   A Packet SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a SIGNATURE TLV as described
   in Section 5.  When calculating the <signature-value> for a Packet,
   the signature is calculated over the entire Packet, including the
   packet header, all Packet TLVs (other than Packet SIGNATURE TLVs) and
   all included Messages and their message headers.

8.1.1.  Packet TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Packet TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a TIMESTAMP TLV as described
   in Section 6.


9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  TLV Registrations

   This specification defines two Message TLV types which must be
   allocated from the 0-127 range of the "Assigned Message TLV Types"
   repository of [RFC5444] as specified in Table 1 and two Packet TLV
   types which must be allocated from the 0-223 range of the "Assigned
   Packet TLV Types" repository of [RFC5444] as specified in Table 2.

   IANA is requested to assign the same numerical value to the Message
   TLV and Packet TLV types with the same name.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a protocol itself.  However, it
   provides a syntactical component for cryptographic signatures of

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


   messages and packets as defined in [RFC5444].  It can be used to
   address security issues of a protocol or extension that uses the
   component specified in this document.  As such, it has the same
   security considerations as [RFC5444].

   In addition, a protocol that includes this component MUST specify the
   usage as well as the security that is attained by the cryptographic
   signatures of a message or a packet.

   As an example, a routing protocol that uses this component to reject
   "badly formed" messages if a control message does not contain a valid
   signature, should indicate the security assumption that if the
   signature is valid, the message is considered valid.  It also should
   indicate the security issues that are counteracted by this measure
   (e.g. link or identity spoofing) as well as the issues that are not
   counteracted (e.g. compromised keys).

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  Example of a Signed Message

   The sample message depicted in Figure 1 is taken from the appendix of
   [RFC5444].  However, a SIGNATURE Message TLV has been added.  It is
   assumed that the SIGNATURE TLV type is lesser than the TLV type of
   the second message TLV (i.e. it comes first in the order of Message
   TLVs).  The TLV value represents a 16 octet long signature of the
   whole message.
