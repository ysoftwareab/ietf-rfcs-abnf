Internet-Draft    Kerberos 5 TCP/IP Expansion Mechanism    November 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Kerberos 5 [3] specification reserve the high order bit in the
   length field for TCP/IP transport for future expansion.  This
   document update [3] to describe the behaviour when that bit is set.

   The required behaviour for clients and KDCs regarding the reserved
   bit was specified as follows in section 7.2.2 of [3]:

      Each request (KRB_KDC_REQ) and response (KRB_KDC_REP or
      KRB_ERROR) sent over the TCP stream is preceded by the
      length of the request as 4 octets in network byte order.
      The high bit of the length is reserved for future
      expansion and MUST currently be set to zero.  If a KDC
      that does not understand how to interpret a set high bit
      of the length encoding receives a request with the high
      order bit of the length set, it MUST return a KRB-ERROR
      message with the error KRB_ERR_FIELD_TOOLONG and MUST
      close the TCP stream.

   This document describe how the high bit is used to implement an
   expansion mechanism.  This expansion mechanism is intended for
   features that are specific for the TCP/IP transport.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Expansion Mechanism for TCP/IP transport

   Kerberos 5 require Key Distribution Centers (KDCs) to accept requests
   over TCP.  Each request and response is prefixed by 4 octets,
   encoding an integer in network byte order, that indicate the length
   of the packet.  The high bit of the 4 octet length field was reserved
   for future expansion.  Servers that do not understand how to
   interpret a set high bit are required to return a KRB-ERROR with the
   KRB_ERR_FIELD_TOOLONG error code, and to close the TCP stream.

   We will use the reserved bit to provide an expansion mechanism.  When
   the reserved high bit is set, the remaining 31 bits of the 4 octets
   are treated as an extensible typed hole, and thus form a 31 bit
   integer enumerating various expansions.  Each of the values indicate
   a specific extended operation mode, which are to be described
   elsewhere.

   If the KDC do not understand a requested expansion, it MUST return a
   KRB-ERROR with a KRB_ERR_FIELD_TOOLONG value (prefixed by the 4 octet
   length integer, with the high bit clear, as usual) and close the TCP
   stream.

   The following table specify the meaning of the 31 lower bits in the 4
   octet field, when the high bit is set:

   0               RESERVED.
   1...2147483647  AVAILABLE for registration, through IANA.
   2147483648      RESERVED.

   Each expansion mechanism MUST describe the structure of protocol data
   beyond the length field, and also the behaviour of the client and
   KDC.


4.  Security Considerations

   Because the initial length field is not protected, it is possible for
   an active attacker (i.e., one that is able to modify traffic between
   the client and the KDC) to make it appear to the client that the
   server do not support this expansion.  Client and KDC policies can be
   used to reject connections that do not use any expansion.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to create a new registry for "Kerberos 5 TCP/IP
   Expansions".  The initial contents of this registry should be:

   [[RFC Editor: Replace xxxx below with the number of this RFC.]]

   Decimal         Meaning                             Reference
   -------         -------                             ---------
   0               RESERVED.                           RFC XXXX
   1...2147483647  AVAILABLE for registration.
   2147483648      RESERVED.                           RFC XXXX

   IANA will register new values on a First Come First Served basis, as
   defined in BCP 64 [2].  Changing the RESERVED values (0 and
   2147483648) will require IETF Consensus.

   While the registration procedures do not require expert review,
   authors of expansion are encouraged to seek community review and
   comment whenever that is feasible.  Authors may seek community review
   by posting a specification of their proposed mechanism as an
   Internet-Draft.  Expansions intended for widespread use should be
