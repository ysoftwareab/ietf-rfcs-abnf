<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user shared simulations, are 
becoming increasingly used for serious work in addition to the traditional 
uses of research and entertainment. Whereas previous distributed simulation 
protocols have been designed with narrow, time-definite scope, the LESS 
(Live Entity State Stream) protocol is designed to allow open-ended join 
and leave for a multitude of simulation peers. The LESS protocol specifies 
how peers of a simulation collaborate and share state to achieve a mutually 
agreed "collective hallucination," leading to a user-perceivable shared 
state of a simulated worlds.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>This protocol (the LESS protocol) describes presenting virtual world object 
properties between virtual world peers (typically, servers of virtual world 
instances). It allows peers to introduce the types of objects that they will 
provide, and allows the responding peers to decide what types, and what 
properties within those types, they actually understand and are interested in. 
This protocol is part of a suite of protocols that together make up an 
advanced virtual world interoperability standard; when all the protocols are 
implemented by two or more separate virtual world systems, those systems can 
interoperate at a high level, and provide a congruent shared experience to 
participants from all the participating world implementations and peer hosts. 
Additional use cases include traditional data loggers, a standardized set of 
analysis tools, and others.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Simulation Model</h3>

<p>
The basic model is that individual objects are simulated on a host that has 
affinity for that object, and a certain set 
of typically well-known properties (identified by id in LESS, and by well-
known name mapping to id in schema) are presented to observing peers. Those 
properties are intended to provide a reasonable level of detail of presentation 
for the object in question as it updates itself, but are not intended to 
provide a perfect replica of the internal workings of the object. Thus, only 
properties that are of interest to presentation (to users or other simulators), 
or user interaction are intended to be included in the schema and data stream. 

</p>
<p>
Because multiple hosts participate in the shared simulation, it is expected 
that each host simulates some number of objects, presenting them to the other 
host peers, while simultaneously receiving presentations of the objects 
simulated on those peers. This makes a typical session using LESS bi-directional. 
When objects simulated on one host interact with objects simulated on another 
host, interactions defined in object schema are forwarded from the host detecting 
the interaction to the host simulating the interactee. Through means outside the 
scope of this protocol, the servers agree on the basic environment of the 
simulation, including properties like gravity, up and North vectors, center of 
coordinate reference frame if referenced to some external frame (such as WGS-84) 
and static, immutable terrain geometry.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Justification</h3>

<p>
The reason for this new protocol, as opposed to various existing protocols such 
as Sun-RPC, SOAP or SNMP is that virtual world objects update their properties 
at typically a much higher rate of change than other kind of objects, and the 
timing of those updates is important. Additionally, efficiency of encoding is 
fairly important, leading to an implicit-type system that puts type description 
out of line with the data update stream. The motivation for this is similar to 
the motivation to use separately negotiated binary codecs for VoIP traffic or 
streaming video traffic.

</p>
<p>
The model of interoperability as viewing the presentation of simulated objects 
through simulation host peer connections was carefully chosen to allow the greatest 
amount of interoperability possible while requiring the least amount of re-work 
within existing virtual world implementations. Server-side peering to construct 
a single, shared space opens up many exciting applications, that alternative 
approaches to interoperability, such as a forced client/server protocol, or 
a forced object execution model, would not enable. Additionally, it is expected 
that the work necessary to implement LESS in existing virtual worlds is less than 
that required to achieve similar interoperability through other means. A model 
with the same justification, but a more anachronistic implementation, has been used 
successfully within the Department of Defense for a long time (IEEE 1278; Distributed 
Interactive Simulation). Meanwhile, a model that requires all participants to share 
a given execution model, (like IEEE 1516; the High-Lefel Architecture) or a common 
interaction description and client protocol (like VRML; Virtual Reality Mark-up 
Language and its successor X3D) has not had the same success in enabling broad 
interoperability across different vendor technologies.

LESS Sessions</h3>

<p>
A connection is established through means outside the scope of this protocol. 
The connection includes each peer referencing a schema for the connection 
(which is separate from a schema for entities and types). That schema describes 
some properties about the protocol implementation (such as what properties are 
allowed in the connection control messages). Authentication is also assumed to 
take place during the connection set-up, before the LESS protocol is in effect. 
One possible implementation is to use HTTP Upgrade: to switch from HTTP/HTTPS 
to the LESS protocol.

</p>
<p>
Live entity state updates are streamed through a sequence of packets. Packets 
are the physical grouping mechanism for transmission over a network or other 
medium. A packet contains zero or more messages. Each message is assumed to 
take effect at the timestamp defined in the packet header. Timestamps are 
integral representations of time at the source end, and are relative to a clock 
that only the source end knows. The duration of a single quantum of the time 
stamp is approximately described in the schema for the connection.

</p>
<p>
The physical serialization of data types (ints, floats, strings and binary) is 
described in addition to the logical description of how the data is organized. 
The logical description assumes the use of object type schemas, as described in 
the LODS (Live Object Description Schema) document. The schema for the type of 
an object must be introduced into the state stream, and the receiving peer must 
subscribe to properties of that type, before objects (entities) of that type 
can be introduced over the wire. Also note that the name spaces and schema 
spaces are not generally the same in both directions -- the connection is really 
two separate connections shared over a bi-directional stream. Object id "123" 
may mean something totally different when sent from peer A to peer B, as opposed 
to when sent from peer B to peer A. To further confuse the matter, each message 
has an implicit direction, which determines which set of identities and schemas 
is used. For example, "update entity" means that properties on the source system 
changed, and thus the object id references objects from the source system. 
"tweak entity" messages are requests from the source to change the state of the 
destination system, so the object id references objects on the destination system.

</p>
<p>
Because transport may be TCP or UDP, some ordering rules need to be enforced:
Property updates are defined to not be ordered. If a property update goes 
out in a packet that is dropped, but the sending side has since sent a new 
update for that same property, the old property set will not be part of the 
re-send of the dropped packet. Simliarly, properties know which packet last 
set them, and a received older packet with a property set will not have any 
new effect on the property in question.

</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, method calls are ordered per entity. A method call may not be 
effected while there are outstanding dropped, not re-sent messages in the 
direciton of the pending method call message. Method calls are also effected 
in the order they are sent in a packet. A corollary is that any packet 
sequence number must be re-sent if dropped over a lossy connection, even if 
such re-send results in a packet with no messages, to avoid later interactions 
to be un-queued and effected.

</p>
<p>
How to handle three or more peers is not defined by this protocol. The connection 
negotiation may tell each connecting peer about all other peers it knows about, 
and only send state updates for entities that it is the master for, or the 
negotiation may include a forwarding arrangement, where one end takes it opon 
itself to forward entity data for some other number of peers. For that to work, 
the forwarding end needs to re-number entities that come from other systems as part 
of this protocol, which means that the forwarding system has to understand all the 
data types that include object ids. Hence, trying to "escape" object id into binary 
blobs in the protocol is not recommended.

UDP Framing discussion</h3>

<p>
When using UDP, the peer should send packets in sequence order, starting at a 
sequence number described in the connection negotiation. Sequence numbers 
increase by 1 for each packet sent, and wrap over. The receiving peer should 
in turn send the latest received sequence number as ack-last-sequence-number 
(with the initial value being one less than the negotiated first sequence number 
in that direction). The ack-previous-bitmask is constructued such that, to send 
an ack for the packet with the sequence number one before the last received 
packet, the lowest bit is set. For the sequence number before that, the second
lowest bit is set. Repeat, up to 64 bits' worth of acknowledgement. This means 
that the maximum outstanding window size is 64 packets. With a simulation rate 
of 30 Hz, this means over two seconds of window size, which should cover any 
moderately interactive scenario. If you want to support higher latency 
connections without running out of bits in the 64-packet oustanding window, just 
pack more into each packet, and send at a lower rate.

</p>
<p>
The UDP peer can stop putting in ack bits when it receives an ack from the other 
end for some packet that it knows that the packet in question was acked in. Also 
see the discussion on which bits of data to include in a packet re-send above. 
Finally, there is no risk of treating a much delayed packet with the same 
sequence number as the current packet as an accidentally correct packet, because 
the timestamp in the header must be monotonically increasing.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
This protocol intends to enable interoperability across different hosts 
using different underlying virtual world technologies. Additionally, trust of 
interoperating hosts is established using means external to this protocol. Thus, 
a parser for the protocol should be conservative in range and value checking, 
and it is recommended that a session is terminated (using means outside this 
protocol) if a framing error or logical error is discovered. For example, a 
remote node may attempt to introduce an object of a type for which the schema 
has not been introduced, or may attempt to present a property that has not been 
subscribed. A remote node may also have implementation defects that do not properly 
follow the marshaling rules for data encoding. Any such deficiency should be 
detected, and lead to immediate disconnection of the remote connection.

</p>
<p>
Additionally, the simulation consistency of each world host is the responsibility 
of that host. Whether a given interaction, method call or property tweak is 
allowed at a particular point in time must be verified by the receiving host. 
By contrast to logical or framing errors, such permission errors may be caused by 
user interface shortcomings, timing/race conditions, etc, and thus should not 
generally result in a dropped connection, but instead a failure result in the 
cases where results are reported (such as method calls).

</p>
<p>
A minimal protection against replay, out-of-order and source-spoofing attacks is 
provided through the 64-bit MAC checksum preceding each packet. If the session is 
initially established through secure means (such as HTTPS), and a hard-to-guess 
MAC key is used to generate this checksum, an open transmission of packets over 
UDP will be moderately hard to spoof using man-in-the-middle attacks or packet 
alteration. However, if full encryption-grade security is required, the LESS 
protocol should be used over a fully trusted channel, such as HTTPS with a high-
grade cypher and a public-key infrastructure based host trust model.
