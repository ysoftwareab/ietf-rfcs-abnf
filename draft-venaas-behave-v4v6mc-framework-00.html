Introduction</h3>

<p>There will be a long period of time where IPv4 and IPv6 systems
	  and networks need to coexist. There are various solutions for how
	  this can be done for unicast, some of which are based on translation.
	  The document <a class='info' href='#I-D.baker-behave-v4v6-framework'>[I&#8209;D.baker&#8209;behave&#8209;v4v6&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., Li, X., and C. Bao, &ldquo;Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>
	  discusses the needs and provides a framework for unicast translation
	  for various scenarios. Here we discuss the need for multicast
	  translation for those scenarios.
	
</p>
<p>
	  For unicast the problem is basically how two hosts can communicate
	  when they are not able to use the same IP protocol. For multicast
	  we can restrict ourselves to looking at how a single source can
	  efficiently send to multiple receivers. When using a single IP
	  protocol one builds a multicast distribution tree from the source
	  to the receivers, and independent of the number of receivers, one
	  sends each data packet only once on each link. We wish to maintain
	  the same characteristics when there are different IP protocols
	  used. That is, when the nodes of the tree (source, receivers and
	  routers) cannot all use the same IP protocol. In general there
	  may be multiple sources sending to a multicast group, but that
	  can be thought of as separate trees, one per source. We will
	  focus on the case where the source and the receivers cannot all
	  use the same IP protocol. If the issue is the network in between,
	  encapsulation may be a better alternative. Note
	  that if the source supports both IPv4 and IPv6, then one
	  alternative could be for the source to send two streams. This
	  need not be the same host. There could be two different hosts,
	  and in different locations/networks, sending the same content.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Translation scenarios</h3>

<p>We will consider six different translation scenarios.
	  For each of the scenarios we will look at how host in one
	  network can receive multicast from a source in another network.
	  For unicast one might consider the following six scenarios:
	
</p>
<p>(1) An IPv6 network to IPv4 Internet
</p>
<p>(2) IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network
</p>
<p>(3) An IPv4 network to IPv6 Internet
</p>
<p>(4) IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network
</p>
<p>(5) An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network
</p>
<p>(6) An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network
</p>
<p>We have intentionally left out how one might connect the entire
	  IPv4 Internet with the entire IPv6 Internet. In these scenarios
	  one would look at how a host in one network initiates a uni- or
	  bi-directional flow to another network. The initiator needs to
	  somehow know which address to send the initial packet to, and
	  the initial packet gets translated before reaching its
	  destination.
	
</p>
<p>
	  For multicast one generally need a receiver to signal the group
	  (and sometimes also the source) it wants to receive from. The
	  signalling generally goes hop-by-hop towards the source to
	  build multicast forwarding state that later is used to forward
	  multicast in the reverse direction. This means that for the
	  receiving host to receive multicast, it must first somehow know
	  which group (and possibly source) it should signal that it wants
	  to receive. These signals would then probably go hop-by-hop to
	  a translator, and then the translated signalling would go
	  hop-by-hop from the translator to the source. Note that this
	  description si correct for SSM (source-specific multicast), but
	  is in reality more complex for ASM (any-source multicast). An
	  anology to
	  unicast might perhaps be TCP streaming where a SYN is sent
	  from the host that wants to receive the stream to the source
	  of the stream. Then the application data flows in the reverse
	  direction of the initial signal. Hence we argue that the above
	  unicast scenarios correspond to the following multicast
	  scenarios, respectively:
	
</p>
<p>(1) An IPv6 network receiving multicast from IPv4 Internet
</p>
<p>(2) IPv6 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv4 network
</p>
<p>(3) An IPv4 network receiving multicast from IPv6 Internet
</p>
<p>(4) IPv4 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv6 network
</p>
<p>(5) An IPv6 network receiving multicast from an IPv4 network
</p>
<p>(6) An IPv4 network receiving multicast from an IPv6 network
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
An IPv6 network receiving multicast from IPv4
			Internet</h3>

<p>
	    Here we have a network, say ISP or enterprise, that for
	    some reason is IPv6-only, but the hosts in the IPv6-only
	    network should be able to receive multicast from sources
	    in the IPv4 internet.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    This is simple because the global IPv4 address space can be
	    embedded into IPv6. Unicast addresses according to the
	    unicast translation in use. For multicast one may
	    embed all IPv4 multicast addresses inside a single IPv6
	    multicast prefix. Or one may have multiple embeddings
	    to allow for appropriate mapping of scopes and ASM versus SSM.
	    Using this embedding, the IPv6 host (or an application
	    running on the host) can send IPv6 MLD reports for IPv6
	    groups (and if SSM, also sources) that specify which
	    IPv4 source and groups that it wants to receive. The
	    usual IPv6 state (including MLD and possibly PIM) needs
	    to be created. If PIM is involved we need to use RPF to
	    set up the tree and accept data, so the source addresses
	    must be routed towards some translation device. This is
	    likely to be the same device that would do the unicast
	    translation. The translation device can in this case be
	    completely stateless. There is some multicast state, but
	    that is similar to the state in a multicast router when
	    translation is not performed. Basically if the translator
	    receives MLD or PIM messages asking for a specific group
	    (or source and group), it uses these mappings to find
	    out which IPv4 group (or source and group) it needs to
	    send IGMP or PIM messages for. This is no different than
	    multicast in general, except for the translation.
	    Whenever the translator receives data from the IPv4
	    source, it checks if it has anyone interested in the
	    respective IPv6 group (or source and group), and if so,
	    translates and forwards the data packets.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    IPv6 applications need to somehow learn which IPv6 group (or
	    source and group) to join. This is further discussed in
	    <a class='info' href='#app'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Application layer issues</span><span>)</span></a>.

IPv6 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv4
			network</h3>

<p>We here consider the case where the Internet is IPv6, but
	    there is some network of perhaps legacy IPv4 hosts that is
	    IPv4-only. We want any IPv6 host on the Internet to be
	    able to receive multicast from an IPv4 source. This scenario
	    can be solved using the same techniques as in scenario (1),
	    <a class='info' href='#scenario1'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>An IPv6 network receiving multicast from IPv4 			Internet</span><span>)</span></a>. There may however be differences
	    regarding exactly which mappings are used and how applications
	    may become aware of them. To obtain full benefit of multicast,
	    all IPv6 hosts need to use the same mappings.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
An IPv4 network receiving multicast from IPv6
			Internet</h3>

<p>
	    Here we consider how an IPv4-only host in an IPv4
	    network may receive from an IPv6 multicast sender on the Internet.
	    For dual-stack hosts in an IPv4 network one should
	    consider tunneling.
	    This is difficult since
	    we cannot embed the entire IPv6 space into IPv4. For
	    unicast one might use a DNS-ALG for this, where the
	    ALG would instantiate translator mappings as needed.
	    However, for multicast one generally does not use DNS.
	    One could consider doing the same with an ALG for some
	    other protocol. E.g. translate addresses in SDP files
	    when they pass the translator, or in any other protocol
	    that might transfer multicast addresses. This would be
	    very complicated and not recommended.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Rather than using an ALG that translates addresses in
	    application protocol payload, one could consider new
	    signalling mechanisms for more explicit signalling.
	    The additional signalling could be either on the IPv6 or
	    the IPv4 side. It may however not be a good idea to
	    require additional behavior by host and applications on
	    the IPv6 Internet to accomodate legacy IPv4 networks.
	    Also, since one may not be able to provide unique IPv4
	    multicast addresses for all the IPv6 multicast groups
	    that are in use, it makes more sense that the mappings
	    are done locally in each of the IPv4 networks, where
	    IPv4 multicast addresses might be assigned on-demand.
	    An IPv4 receiver might somehow request an IPv4 mapping
	    for an IPv6 group (and possibly source). This creates
	    a mapping in the translator so that when the IPv4 receiver
	    joins the IPv4 group, the translator knows which IPv6
	    group (and possibly source) to translate it into.
	    Of course the signalling could also be done manually by
	    adding a static mapping to the translator and somehow

IPv4 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv6
			network</h3>

<p>
	    Here we will consider an IPv6 network connected to the
	    IPv4 internet, and how any IPv4 host may receive multicast
	    from a source in the IPv6 network. This is difficult
	    since the IPv6 multicast address space cannot be
	    embedded into IPv4. Indeed this case has many similarities
	    with how IPv4 networks can receive from the IPv6 Internet.
	    However, in this case, all IPv4 hosts on the Internet should
	    use the same mapping, and it might make sense to have
	    additional requirements on the IPv6 network, rather than
	    to add requirements for the IPv4 Internet.
	  
</p>
<p>One solution here might be for the IPv6 source
	    application to somehow register with the translator to
	    set up a mapping and receive an IPv4 address. The
	    application could then possibly send SDP that includes
	    both its IPv6 source and group, and the IPv4 source and
	    group it got from the translator. Of course the signalling
	    could also be done by manually adding a static mapping to
	    the translator and specifying that address to the
	    application. If instead we were to
	    do signalling on the IPv4 side, then an IPv4 receiver
	    would probably need a mechanism for finding an IPv4
	    address of the translator for a given IPv6 group. The
	    IPv4 address could perhaps be embedded in the IPv6
	    group address? Or with say SDP there could be a way
	    of specifying the IPv4 translator address. The IPv4
	    host could then communicate with the translator to
	    establish a mapping (unless one exists) and learn
	    which IPv4 group to join.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    The best alternative might be to restrict the IPv6 multicast
	    groups that should be accessible on the IPv4 internet to a
	    certain IPv6 prefix. This may allow stateless translation.
	    This could also be used in the reverse direction, for an IPv6
	    host to receive from an IPv4 source. Or in other words, the
	    same mapping can be used in both directions. This has
	    similarities with IVI <a class='info' href='#I-D.baker-behave-ivi'>[I&#8209;D.baker&#8209;behave&#8209;ivi]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, X., Bao, C., Baker, F., and K. Yin, &ldquo;IVI Update to SIIT and NAT-PT,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>

	    By using IVI source addresses and a
	    similar technique for multicast addresses, the correct
	    IPv4 source and group addresses can be derived from those.
	    This method has many benefits, the main issue is that it
	    cannot work for arbitrary IPv6 multicast addresses.

An IPv6 network receiving multicast from an IPv4
			network</h3>

<p>
	    In this scenario we consider IPv4 and IPv6 networks belonging
	    to the same organization. We would like any IPv6 host to
	    receive from any IPv4 sources. Here one can use the same
	    techniques as for an IPv6 network receiving from IPv4 internet.
	    It is really a special case of scenario (1),
	    <a class='info' href='#scenario1'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>An IPv6 network receiving multicast from IPv4 			Internet</span><span>)</span></a>.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    The fact that the number of hosts are limited and
	    that there is common management might simplify things. Due
	    to the limited scale, one could perhaps just manually
	    configure all the static mappings needed in the translator
	    and manually create the necessary announcements or in some cases
	    have the applications create the necessary announcements.
	    But it might be better to use a stateless approach where
	    IPv4 unicast and multicast addresses are embedded into
	    IPv6. Like IVI <a class='info' href='#I-D.baker-behave-ivi'>[I&#8209;D.baker&#8209;behave&#8209;ivi]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, X., Bao, C., Baker, F., and K. Yin, &ldquo;IVI Update to SIIT and NAT-PT,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> or

Routing</h3>

<p>
	    The actual translation of multicast packets may not be very
	    complicated, in particular if it can be stateless. For the
	    multicast to actually go through the translator we need to
	    have routes for the multicast source addresses involved, so
	    that multicast packets both on their way to and from the
	    translator satisfy RPF checks. These routes are also needed
	    for protocols like PIM-SM to establish a multicast tree,
	    since RPF is used to determine where to send join messages.
	    To go into more detail we need to look at different scenarios
	    like SSM (Source-Specific Multicast) and ASM (Any-Source
	    Multicast), and PIM versus IGMP/MLD.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Translation with PIM and SSM</h3>

<p>
	      When doing SSM, a receiver specifies both source and group
	      addresses. If the receiver is to receive translated packets,
	      it must do an IGMP/MLD join for the source and group address
	      that the data packets will have after translation. We will
	      later look at how it may learn those addresses. For the
	      source address it joins, the unicast routing (or it may be
	      an alternate topology specific to multicast), must point
	      towards the translator. With this in place, PIM should
	      build a tree hop-by-hop from the last-hop router to the
	      translator. The translator then maps the source and group
	      addresses in the PIM join to the source and group the data
	      packets have before translation. The translator then does
	      a PIM join for that source and group. Provided the routing
	      is correct, this will then build a tree all the way to the
	      source. Finally when these joins reach the source, any data
	      sent by the source will follow this path to the translator,
	      get translated, and then continue to the receiver.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Translation with PIM and ASM</h3>

<p>
	      Let us first consider PIM Sparse Mode. In this case a
	      receiver just joins a group. If this group is to be
	      received via the translator we need to send joins
	      towards the translator, but initially PIM will send
	      joins towards the RP (Rendezvous-Point) for the group.
	      The most efficient solution is probably to make sure
	      that the translator is configured as an RP for all
	      groups that one may receive through it. That is, for
	      the groups it translates to. E.g. if IPv4 groups are
	      embedded into an IPv6 multicast prefix, then the
	      translator could be an RP for that specific prefix.
	      The translator may then translate the group and join
	      towards the group address that is used before
	      translation. Note that if the translator also is an
	      RP for the addresses used before translation, it should
	      know which sources exist and join each of these. If it
	      is not an RP, it needs to join towards the RP. If the
	      translator did not know the sources, it may join each
	      of the sources as soon as it receives from them (that
	      is, switching to Shortest Path Trees). When the
	      translator receives data, it translates it and then
	      sends the translated data. This then follows the
	      joins for the translated groups to the receivers.
	      When the last-hop routers start receiving, they
	      will probably (this is usually the default behavior)
	      switch to SPTs (Shortest Path Trees). These trees also
	      need to go to the translator and would probably
	      follow the same path as the previously built shared
	      tree. One might argue here that switching to the
	      SPT has no benefit if it is the same path anyway. Also
	      with shared trees, RPF is not an issue, so the translated
	      source addresses don't need to be routed towards the
	      translator.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      At the end of the previous paragraph we pointed out
	      that there is no benefit in switching to shortest
	      path trees if they have to go via the translator
	      anyway. A possibility here could be to use Bidirectional
	      PIM where there is no source specific state and data 
	      always go through the RP. It is possible to use Bidir
	      just for those groups that are translated, and then
	      make the translator the RP.

Translation with IGMP/MLD</h3>

<p>
	      For translation taking place close to the edge, e.g.
	      a home gateway, one may consider just using IGMP and
	      MLD, and no PIM. In that case the translator should
	      for any received MLD reports for IPv6 groups that
	      correspond to translated IPv4 groups, map those into
	      IGMP reports that it sends out on the IPv4 side. And
	      vice versa for data in the other direction. Note that
	      a translator implementation could also choose to do
	      this in just one direction. For SSM it would also
	      need to translate the source addresses.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Application layer issues</h3>

<p>
	    The main application layer issue is perhaps how the applications
	    learn what groups (or sources and groups) to join. For unicast,
	    applications may often obtain addresses via DNS and a DNS-ALG.
            For multicast, DNS is usually not used, and there are a
	    wide range of different ways applications learn addresses. It
	    can be through configuration or user input, it can be URLs on
	    a web page, it can be SDP files (via SAP or from web page or
	    mail etc), or also via protocols like RTSP/SIP. It is no easy task
	    to handle all of these possible methods using ALGs.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    An alternative
	    to rewriting addresses in the network is to make the applications
	    aware of the translation and mappings in use. One approach could
	    be for the source to create say SDP that includes both the
	    original and the translated addresses. This may require use of
	    ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
	    for specifying both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses,
	    allowing the receiver to choose which one to use. The other
	    alternative would be for the receiving application to be aware
	    of the translation and the mapping in use. This means that the
	    receiving application can receive the original SDP, but then
	    apply the mapping to those addresses.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    As we just discussed, it may be useful for applications to
	    perform the mappings. The next question is how they may
	    learn those mappings. The easiest would be if there was a
	    standard way used for all mappings, e.g. a well-known IPv6
	    prefix for embedding IPv4 addresses. But that does not work
	    in all scenarios. There could be a way for applications to
	    learn which prefix to use, see
	    <a class='info' href='#I-D.wing-behave-learn-prefix'>[I&#8209;D.wing&#8209;behave&#8209;learn&#8209;prefix]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wing, D., &ldquo;Learning the IPv6 Prefix of a Network's IPv6/IPv4 Translator,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. But note
	    that there may be different multicast prefixes depending on
	    whether we are doing SSM or ASM and scope. In addition we
	    need the unicast prefix for the multicast source addresses.
	    Alternatively one could imagine applications requesting
	    mappings for specific addresses on demand from the translator.
	    The translator could have static mappings, or install mappings
	    as requested by applications.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    An alternative to making applications aware of the translation
	    and rewriting addresses as needed, could be to do translation
	    in the API or stack, so that e.g. an application joins an IPv4
	    group, the API or stack rewrites that into IPv6 and sends the
	    necessary MLD reports. When IPv6 packets arrive, the API/stack
	    can rewrite those packets back to IPv4. This could allow
	    legacy IPv4 applications to run on a dual-stack node (or
	    IPv6-only with translation in the API) to receive IPv4
	    packets through an IPv6-only network. But in this case it
	    might be better to just use tunneling.
