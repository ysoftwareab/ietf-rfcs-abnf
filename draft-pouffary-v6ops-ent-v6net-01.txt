INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-pouffary-v6ops-ent-v6net-01.txt      October 2002


1. Introduction

   IPv6 will be deployed in Enterprise networks. This scenario has
   requirements for the adoption of IPv6.  This document will focus upon
   and define: a set of technology scenarios that shall exist for the
   Enterprise network, the set of transition variables, transition
   methods, and tools required by different scenarios. The document
   using these definitions will define the points of transition for an
   Enterprise network.

   An Enterprise network for this document is a user network connected
   to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a Private Network Service
   Provider (PSNP), is actively managed by the users of that network,
   and has multiple independent networks within the Enterprise.  It may
   also have mobile IP users accessing the Enterprise Network within the
   Enterprise network, from the public Internet into the Enterprise, or
   from a private external Internet network.  An Enterprise could be a
   Fortune 100 company large business (e.g. Manufacturing, Financial,
   Government) or a small office business (e.g. Law Firm, Stock
   Brokerage, Discrete Engineering Parts Supplier, Office of 30 users).

   The Enterprise network rate and methods for the adoption of IPv6 will
   vary and the only constant we can hope to define are the transition
   and tools requirements based on what we have learned currently from
   existing work on IPv6 transition mechanisms, current early adopter
   deployment, and the results produced from this document.  This
   document will not declare specific transition mechanisms or tools;
   but rather provide a template that users, implementors, and IETF
   specifications can use to apply or define such mechanisms and tools.
   A goal of this document is to have the result be a template for how
   existing transition mechanism and tools could be used in the
   Enterprise network scenario.




2. Requirements

         The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
         NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
         "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
         RFC 2119.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-pouffary-v6ops-ent-v6net-01.txt      October 2002


3. Terminology

  Enterprise Network (EN)          - An Enterprise Network is a network
                                     that has multiple links, a router
                                     conection to an EN Network Provider,
                                     and is actively managed by a network
                                     operations entity.

  EN Provider (ENP)                - An Enterprise Network Provider (ENP) is
                                     an entity that provides services and
                                     connectivity to the Internet or other
                                     private external networks for the EN.

  EN Edge (ENE)                    - An Enterprise Network Edge is the ingress
                                     and egress points connecting an EN to the
                                     Internet, EN Extranet, or to another private
                                     external network.

  EN Administrative Domain (ENAD)  - An Enterprise Network Administrative Domain
                                     are the ingress and egress points connecting
                                     nodes across the EN behind any ENEs.

  EN Extranet (ENX)                - An Enterprise Network Extranet are any EN
                                     owned network components at the ENE, but
                                     not part of the ENAD.

  EN Border Router (ENBR)          - An Enterprise Network Border Router is a
                                     a router that is configured at an ENE
                                     within the Enterprise.

  EN Internal Router (ENIR)        - An Enterprise Network Internal Router is
                                     a router that is NOT configured at an ENE,
                                     but within the ENAD.

  EN Mobile                        - An Enterprise Network condition when a node
                                     changes its network location, or is not attached
                                     to the ENAD.

  EN Mobile Node (ENMN)            - An Enterprise Network Mobile Node is any
                                     node that is EN Mobile within or not within
                                     the ENAD, or as remote telecommuting node.

  EN Points of Transtion (ENPT)    - An Enterprise Network Point of Transition
                                     is a general abstraction prefix to note
                                     functions within the EN that must be defined
                                     for the transition to IPv6.

  Internet Network Provider (INP)  - An ENP that provides connectivity and services
                                     to the public Internet.

  Private Network Provider (PNP)   - An ENP that provides connectivity and services
                                     to a private Internet.

  Dual Stack IPv4/IPv6 Node (DSN)  - A node that supports IPv4 and IPv6.

4. Enterprise Network Assumptions

   In this section assumptions for this document are provided. Such as
   no one can tell users how to transition, they will all do it
   differently.  Some users will move right to IPv6 not later simply
   because it is easier for those using 802.11 technology with Mobile
   IP, as one example.  Some users have hardly any IPv4 address space
   while others have plenty of IPv4 address space.  Global Address space
   vs private is a point of contention to determine how to transition to
   IPv6.  For ENAD applications to comunicate across an INP or PNP
   requires global routable addresses for peer to peer communications
   and security.

   ENs will vary in size and network complexity from a small office to a
   large manufacturing operation with multiple sites, across a wide
   geography. ENPTs functions will need to be defined for the following:

     - Routers
     - Non Router Nodes
     - Network Topology
     - Network Applications
     - Network Management and Tools
     - Network Security
     - Network Mobility
     - Network VPNs
     - Network Telecommuter Work Force
     - Network Inter Site Communications

   This document will identify those ENPTs and discuss them within a set
   of EN scenarios.  This document will not provide the solutions for
   these ENPTs.  A set of suggested solutions will be provided in a
   follow on document to this work.

   ENs will vary how they approach the transition to IPv6 depending on a
   set of transition variables (V1..VN):

      V1:  IPv4 NAT and Firewall at the ENBR and ENAD uses IPv4 private addresses.
      V2:  IPv4 Firewall at the ENBR and ENAD uses IPv4 global routable addresses.
      V3:  Applications must be able to communicate between remote ENADs using
           INPs or PNPs.
      V4:  The methods and security used to access the ENAD for Telecommuters
           and Mobile Nodes.
      V5:  IPv6 software upgrades are not available for existing EN routers and nodes.
      V6:  Source code for applications have been lost or cannot be upgraded to
           IPv6.
      V7:  New business function being defined and can exist without extensive access
           to legacy IPv4 networks and nodes.
      V8:  Mission critical applications must be able to interoperate with legacy IPv4
           nodes.
      V9:  Legacy IPv4 nodes can be upgraded to support dual stack IPv4 and IPv6.
      V10: Legacy IPv4 nodes cannot be upgraded to support dual stack IPv4 and IPv6
      V11: What time frames are required for the adoption of IPv6 for a set of business
           requirements.
      V12: What sections of the network for an existing EN or new EN will move towards
           IPv6 deployment first, second, ...., last, and at what rate.
      V13: What are the network security requirements for the EN.
      V14: ENP does not support IPv6.

   The transition variables are the parameters to the first function to
   determine the transition needs for a specific EN.  These variables
   will define the approach an EN takes to deploy IPv6. Once the EN
   transition variables are understood then the EN will select
   transition methods as follows (M1..MN):

      M1:  IPv4 Tunnels to Encapsulate IPv6
      M2:  IPv6 Tunnels to Encapsulate IPv4
      M3:  IPv6 NAT to Communicate with IPv4
      M4:  IPv6 Native LANs
      M5:  IPv6 Native Routing Domains
      M6:  Dual Stack Nodes supporting IPv6 and IPv4
      M7:  Single Stack IPv6 ONLY Nodes (no known implementations today)

   Each EN will need to select the method to best suit their business
   requirements. Any attempt to define a default or one-size-fits-all
   set of variables and methods for all ENs would result in failure.
   These methods are discussed in Section 6 of the document.

   This document will define a list of sets for transition variables,
   methods, and tool requirements, which will provide a three
   dimensional system for analysis that can be used to extrapolate a set
   of solutions.  Where the X axis is the transition variables (V#), the
   Y axis the transition method (M#), and the Z axis the tools
   requirement set ( section 8) to support X and Y conditions. This
   point on the graph will be an EN transtion strategy. After the
   document describes the EN scenarios in depth (section 9) the graph
   will be depicted in a matrix for readers of this document (section
   10)

   It will be impossible within a reasonable time frame for the document
   to define all possible sets, for all ENs, that will transition to
   IPv6.  The documents objective is to provide enough data to those
   working to define transition for an EN can use this document as
   analysis. In addition, the document will be useful for implementors
   to select specific EN transition strategies to support.

5. Enterprise Network Scenarios Overview

   These are the six scenarios that will be used in the document to
   drive the ENPTs, which will be determined by the transition
   variables, methods, and tools. This is an overview of each of the
   scenarios.

         Scenario #1

         A large (20,000+ node) enterprise has an existing IPv4 network and
         wishes to turn on IPv6 for an engineering development group of
         ~100 clients that exist at two geographic sites. Each engineering
         group is on its own switched subnet. The IPv6 clients need to
         communicate with each other, but still need access to IPv4 based
         services provided by the corporation. What needs to be done to
         enable this deployment and where?

         Scenario #2

         An enterprise decides to deploy wireless services across their
         network, and for reasons of geography and topology groups of access
         points end up on different subnets. To optimize their support for IP
         mobility, they choose to make this service IPv6-only, while to secure
         the air link they choose to have all connections use a VPN access
         technology. These mobile IPv6-only nodes will still need access to
         legacy IPv4-only applications.

         Scenario #3

         A modest sized (<10,0000 nodes) multi-site enterprise has
         deployed IPv4-NAT with overlapping private address ranges between
         the sites. They are looking to improve productivity through a
         peer-to-peer conferencing application, that will need to work between
         sites. They are willing to update the operating systems running that
         application to support both IPv4 & IPv6, and over time will do the
         same for other services on the network. Which transition technologies
         are applicable initially as they begin using the application? What
         changes or additional technologies are applicable when the ISP for
         some, but not all sites, offers native IPv6 service? What transition
         technologies are applicable when all ISPs offer IPv6 services, but
         some of the internal nodes remain IPv4-only?

         Scenario #4

         A very large global enterprise interacts with a public and private
         Internet as a cohesive unit, but is composed of several administratively
         distinct business units. Some of the business units want to deploy a
         substantial number of stationary nodes (>10,000) in a single subnet,
         while having those subnets accessible by all the business units. To
         accomplish this as well as support wireless mobility and peer-to-peer
         conferencing, they choose to enable these new services as IPv6-only.
         At the same time there is need to support legacy IPv4-only applications,
         and access the public Internet from the wireless mobile nodes. What
         transition technologies are applicable when only parts of a
         geographically disperse business unit are capable of IPv6 packet
         forwarding? What transition technologies become applicable when an
         entire business unit is capable, but other business units are not
         fully capable? What transition technologies apply at the boundary to

         the public Internet?

         Scenario #5

         Two large enterprises using IPv4-NAT merge with the consequence
         that large segments of private network address space overlap. To allow
         the network operations to merge they decide to deploy IPv6 across
         the network core and support infrastructure first. What transition
         mechanisms apply to the process of migrating and managing the network
         core? What transition technologies apply to the support infrastructure?
         To further integrate the systems, what transition technologies are
         applicable to the end nodes?

         Scenario #6

         A new Enterprise network is being defined for a new Trucking Business
         that provides location based services for their Truck Fleet over a
         wide geography.  The network will grow to > 10,000 nodes, and the
         Truck Fleets and Account Teams will use Mobile devices to access
         the Enterpise network's data and services. In addition many employees
         will be able to telecommute and work from home.  There is no physical
         Enterprise network today, and the Enterprise network team for the
         business wants to build this new network with IPv6.

6. Enterprise Points of Transition Methods

   The Enterprise network will have varying points of transition that
   will require different points of interoperability with IPv6 and IPv4.
   These points of transition are the fulcrum of the template to define
   what is required for Enterprise networks within the focus of this
   document.



6.1 M1: IPv4 Tunnels to Encapsulate IPv6

   This ENPT exists for the following conditions:

       1. Two DSNs want to communicate using IPv6 within an ENAD but
          IPv4 ENIR is between them.  These nodes could also be ENMNs.
       2. Two DSNs want to communicate using IPv6 within an ENAD, but they
          are in remote site ENAD geographies and packets must be sent to INP
          or PNP.  These nodes could also be ENMNs.
       3. An ENMN DSN within the ENAD wants to communicate with IPv6
          node and services in the ENAD, and is on remote IPv4 network.
       4. An ENMN DSN not within the ENAD wants to communicate with IPv6
          node and services in the ENAD, and is on remote IPv6 network.
       5. Two ENMN DSNs want to communicate using IPv6, and both are on
          remote IPv4 network.
       6. Two ENMN DSNs want to communicate using IPv6, and both are on
          remote IPv6 network.

6.2 M2: IPv6 Tunnels to Encapsulate IPv4

   This ENPT exists for the following conditions:

       1. A DSN wants to communicate to a legacy ENAD IPv4 service and is
          on a Native IPv6 link and Routing Domain.  EN policy is
          that IPv6 should be used to encapsulate IPv4 from the DSN,
          ENIR, or ENBR to legacy IPv4 services and nodes.
       2. A DSN wants to communicate to a legacy ENAD IPv4 service and is
          on a Native IPv6 link and Routing Domain. EN policy is
          that for DSNs IPv4 can be used if supported by the ENIR or
          ENBR.
       3. Same conditions above but for ENMN DSN within the ENAD and
          not within the ENAD.
       4. Others ??



6.3 M3: IPv6 NAT to Communicate with IPv4

      1. A DSN wants to communicate with a legacy ENAD IPv4 ONLY service
         or node.  EN policy is that IPv6 NAT should be used for this
         communications.
      2. An IPv6 ONLY node wants to communicate with a legacy ENAD
         IPv4 ONLY node or service.
      3. Same conditions above but for ENMN IPv6 ONLY node within the
         ENAD and not within the ENAD.

      4. Others ????

   ***IMPORTANT Discussion for Design Team and Working Group*** Should
   we recommend the following to the working group in the next draft and
   discuss at the IETF Atlanta meeting with the working group the
   following:

      1. The EN Design Team highly recommends that ENs not adopt the policy
         in reference "1" above.
      2. IPv6 ONLY nodes should not be deployed in an EN until they will not
         require access to any legacy IPv4.  This means that applications
         and infrastructure has been ported or moved to IPv6.  Until that
         time nodes for transition should be DSNs.  This means ENs that
         want to use IPv6 ONLY nodes will be required to move applications
         and infrastructure to IPv6 first.

   We also need to get industry input from IPv6 early adopters and those
   planning to move to IPv6 or in IPv6 test mode to note in this draft.
   It is imperative we get all input on this issue because it can mean
   avoiding NAT for IPv6 and the loss of end-2-end communications and
   security for the deployment of Next Generation Networks.



6.4 M4: IPv6 Native LANs

   This ENPT exists when the ENAD wants to support the deployment of
   Native IPv6 LANs.  This condition will be driven by the EN transition
   variables V1-V14 stated in Section 4.



6.5 M5: IPv6 Native Routing Domains

   This ENPT exists when the ENAD and/or the ENE wants to support the
   deployment of IPv6 Native Routing Domains.  This condition will be
   driven by the EN variables V1-14 stated in Section 4.



6.6 M6: Dual Stack Nodes supporting IPv6 and IPv4

   This ENPT is a method to deploy IPv6 and a method for transition.  An
   EN that deploys DSNs as they adopt IPv6 are more assured that IPv6
   and IPv4 interoperation will be possible between the two nodes or
   services.  It also means for many legacy IPv4 nodes that they can be
   upgraded to support IPv4 and IPv6, but not turn on IPv6 until the
   IPv6 operational network has been verified to be interoperable and
   secure.  It also means that both IPv4 and IPv6 can be supported by
   the nodes that transition to IPv6 and then will be able to
   communicate with IPv4 nodes using an IPv4 network infrastructure.



6.7 M7: Single Stack IPv6 ONLY Nodes

   This ENPT will exist when ENs deploy IPv6 ONLY nodes.  At this time
   there are no known implementations of these node types.  This method

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-pouffary-v6ops-ent-v6net-01.txt      October 2002


   for transition will require IPv6 NAT and the EN will lose IPv6
   capability and end-2-end security for IPv6 ONLY to IPv4 ONLY
   communications.

   in Section 6.3.
