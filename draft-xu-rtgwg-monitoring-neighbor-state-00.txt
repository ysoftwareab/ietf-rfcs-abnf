           Real-Time Monitoring Link/Protocol Neighbor State
              draft-xu-rtgwg-monitoring-neighbor-state-00

Abstract

   Various protocols are deployed in today's networks, such as BGP /
   ISIS / OSPF etc.  Link neighbor state changes and protocol neighbor
   state changes are the most important network events that need to be
   processed with the highest priority.  In particular, the SDN
   controller needs to quickly sense the link neighbor & protocol
   neighbor state change information in the network.  Thus, the various
   policies applied by the SDN controller to the network can quickly
   match the current state of the network.  This document discusses some
   possible scenarios and the relevant requirements.

1.  Introduction

   Various protocols are deployed in today's networks, such as BGP /
   ISIS / OSPF / LDP / BFD etc.  When managing a network, one of the
   most important things to monitor is changes to the various protocols'
   neighbor states.  Many times a protocol neighbor state change is
   indicative of a problem on the network, and it is an important basis
   for the SND controller to deploy the traffic steering policies.
   There are several ways to monitor these state changes, e.g. we can
   use command-line interface (CLI) to get them from the devices, but
   typically it's done with either SNMP based polling and/or SNMP traps.
   For BGP, we can use BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) [RFC7854] to
   collect BGP neighbor state change information.

   Link neighbor state changes and protocol neighbor state changes are
   the most important network events that need to be processed with the
   highest priority.  In particular, the SDN controller needs to quickly
   sense the link neighbor & protocol neighbor state change information
   in the network.  Thus, the various policies applied by the SDN
   controller to the network can quickly match the current state of the
   network.

   The problem of the current real-time data collection method:
   Collecting protocol neighbor state will also collect many other large
   amounts of information data associated with it and have a significant
   impact on the reception/processing of high priority protocol neighbor
   state data.  E.g., the processing of the BMP Peer Up/Down message is
   not real-time, and is affected by the receiving and processing of
   other BMP messages, especially a large number of route monitoring
   messages.

   At present, the SDN controller uses a single channel to receive real-
   time data from the network, and then classifies the data and
   processes it in order, which causes the delay of the neighbor state
   information processing to grow; and the neighbor information data
   structure of different protocols are different; these cases will
   increase the delay in which the SDN controller processes neighbor
   state data.

2.  Requirements and Options

   Summary of requirements are as follows:

   Requirement 1: Network event prioritization, Set Link neighbor state
   changes and protocol neighbor state changes as the most important
   network events.

   Requirement 2: The structure of the link neighbor & protocol neighbor
   state change information needs to use a normalized format, such as a
   unified TLV.

   Requirement 3: Link Neighbor & Protocol Neighbor State Change
   Information requires a separate transport channel to be separated
   from other low priority data.

   Requirement 4: SDN controller implements the convergence mechanism of
   the existing network protocol in milliseconds/second.

   Some options to be discussed:

   1) A new Neighbor State Monitoring Protocol.

   2) Consider processing all neighbor states into LS information,
   flooding them through IGP, and collecting them on the controller
   through BGP-LS.

   3) Consider processing all neighbor states into LS information,
   imorting them to the BGP-LS Local-RIB, and collecting them on the
   controller through BMP.

   4) gRPC + YANG Model.

   5) To be added...

3.  Neighbor State Information Format

   At present, the neighbor information data structure of different
   protocols are different.  In order to speed up processing in
   controller or collector, this document proposes to use a normalized
   format as following:

     +---------------------------------------+
     |      Protocol Type                    |
     +---------------------------------------+
     |      Node-IP Address                  |
     +---------------------------------------+
     |      Local-IP Address                 |
     +---------------------------------------+
     |      Peer-IP Address                  |
     +---------------------------------------+
     |      Neighbor State                   |
     +---------------------------------------+
     |      Timestamp                        |
     +---------------------------------------+
     Figure 1 Link Neighbor/Protocol Neighbor State Information Format


   Where:

   Protocol Type: 1: ISIS / 2: OSPF / 3: BGP / 4: LDP / 5: BFD etc.

   Node-IP Address: The IP Address of the monitored node, usually the
   router ID.

   Local-IP Address: Local-IP Address of the Neighbor

   Peer-IP Address: Peer-IP Address of the Neighbor

   Neighbor State: The state of the Neighbor

   Timestamp: The timestamp of the moment of the event
