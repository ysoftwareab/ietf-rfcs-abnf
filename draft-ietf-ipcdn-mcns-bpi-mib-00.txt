Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it defines a basic set of
   managed objects for SNMP-based management of the Baseline Privacy
   Interface for MCNS compliant cable modems and cable modem termination
   systems. This MIB is defined as an extension to the MCNS Radio
   Frequency Interface MIB [5].

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMPv2 SMI.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework
   and existing SNMP standards.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

   This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be
   addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@terayon.com
   and/or the author.

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol
        for accessing managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3. Overview

   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of the
   Baseline Privacy Interface for MCNS compliant Cable Modems (CMs) and
   Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs).  This MIB specification is
   derived from the MCNS Baseline Privacy Interface specification [7],
   which is an extension to the MCNS Radio Frequency Interface
   specification [8].

3.1.  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB consists of one group of CM-only objects (docsBpiCmGroup),
   and one group of CMTS-only objects (docsBpiCmtsGroup).

   The CM-only objects are organized into two tables:

   o    The docsBpiCmBaseTable contains objects for managing basic
        Baseline Privacy parameters and counters, and for managing the
        Authorization finite state machine.

   o    The docsBpiCmTEKTable contains objects for managing the Traffic

INTERNET-DRAFT         MCNS Baseline Privacy MIB               July 1998


        Encryption Key (TEK) finite state machine per SID.

   The CMTS-only objects are organized into four groupings:

   o    The docsBpiCmtsBaseTable contains objects for managing basic
        Baseline Privacy parameters and counters.

   o    The docsBpiCmtsAuthTable contains objects for managing the
        Authorization association information per cable modem.

   o    The docsBpiCmtsTEKTable contains objects for managing the TEK
        association information per SID.

   o    The docsBpiMulticastControl consists of two tables.  The
        docsBpiIpMulticastMapTable controls the mapping of downstream
        IP multicast data traffic to downstream multicast SID values.
        The docsBpiMulticastAuthTable controls which CMs are authorized
        to receive downstream traffic transmitted over particular
        multicast SIDs; a CM will receive TEKs corresponding to the
        multicast SIDs for which it is authorized.  The combination of
        these two tables will limit the distribution of downstream IP
        multicast data traffic to authorized CMs.

3.2.  Management requirements

   The Baseline Privacy Interface specification is documented in [7],
   and is an extension to the Radio Frequency Interface specification
   documented in [8].  In addition to the explicit requirements in this
   specification, the CM and CMTS enabled for Baseline Privacy MUST
   support all applicable MCNS and IETF requirements and MIB objects.
   Specifications that identify relevant requirements and MIB objects
   include the IETF Radio Frequency MIB [5], the IETF Cable Device MIB
   [6], and the MCNS OSSI Specification [9].

   The explicit management requirements of the Baseline Privacy
   Interface, which motivate the development of the MIB in this
   document, are detailed below:

   o    The CM and CMTS MUST support viewing relevant RSA public keys,
        for future subscriber authentication applications.

   o    The Baseline Privacy management interface needs to support
        operator configuration of Authorization and TEK Finite State
        Machine (FSM) parameters, for performance tuning and security
        incident handling.  The CMTS MUST support configuring and
        viewing all FSM-related parameters, including baseline privacy
        status (enabled or disabled), key lifetimes, key grace times,
        and state timeout values.  The CM MUST support viewing these

        parameters where possible.

   o    The management interface needs to support operator analysis and
        override of FSM behavior, for fault management, subscriber
        service de-provisioning, and security incident handling.  The CM
        MUST support viewing the current FSM states.  The CM and CMTS
        MUST support viewing message error codes and message error
        strings, and counters for invalid KEK and TEK events, for key
        expirations and renewals, and for duplicate messages.  The CM
        and CMTS MUST support viewing current authorization key sequence
        numbers and key expiration times for failure diagnosis.

   o    The management interface needs to support dynamic control of the
        distribution of IP multicast data traffic.  This control
        includes forwarding IP multicast traffic to the correct
        multicast group (SID), and managing the membership lists of each
        multicast group (SID).  The CMTS MUST support configuring and
        viewing all IP multicast forwarding state, and all multicast
        group memberships, within the MAC domains of the CMTS.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Baseline Privacy Interface provides data encryption for MCNS
   data-over-cable services.  Baseline Privacy-capable cable modems have
   RSA private/public key pairs installed by manufacturers.  The public
   key is used to encrypt an Authorization key, and the Authorization
   key is used to encrypt one or more Traffic Encryption Keys (TEKs).
   The TEKs are used to encrypt both upstream and downstream data
   traffic.  Please refer to [7] to obtain further information on the
   Baseline Privacy specification.

   In particular, the Baseline Privacy Interface does not provide an
   authentication service.  CMTS implementors are encouraged not to rely
   on the MAC address of the CM for service authorization (in
   particular, for the docsBpiMulticastAuthTable in this MIB), without
   verifying the association between the MAC address and the RSA public
   key.  The mechanism to verify the MAC address to RSA public key

   association is beyond the scope of this specification.

   This MIB specification contains a number of read-write objects, that
   should be protected from unauthorized modification to prevent denial
   of service and theft of service attacks: in particular, objects that
   manage enabling/disabling privacy (ex. docsBpiCmTEKPrivacyEnable),
   resetting state machines (ex. docsBpiCmAuthReset), key lifetimes (ex.
   docsBpiCmtsDefaultAuthLifetime), rekeying grace times (ex.
   docsBpiCmtsDefaultAuthGraceTime), and multicast traffic control (i.e.
   any object in the docsBpiMulticastControl group).

   The desired means to protect these objects from unwarranted access is
   to implement the SNMPv3 Management Frameworks [11] on CMs and CMTSs,
   with implementations of a Security Model and an Access Control Model
   that satisfy the security and access control needs of the cable
   service provider.  SNMPv3 agent implementations are currently not
   required for the MCNS data over cable service.

   Other means to protect CMs from unauthorized access include using the
   docsDevNmAccessTable from the Cable Device MIB [6] to disallow
   configuration changes from unauthorized network management stations,
   and using the SNMP MIB Object and SNMP Write-Access Control
   configuration file options from the Radio Frequency Interface [8] to
   set MIB object values and disable SNMP SET operations at cable modem
   boot time.  Note that these mechanisms may be vulnerable to an
   unauthorized network management station "spoofing" the source address
   of a legitimate network management station.
