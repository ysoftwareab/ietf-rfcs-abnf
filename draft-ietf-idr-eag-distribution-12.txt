 Distribution of Traffic Engineering Extended Admin Groups using BGP-LS
                   draft-ietf-idr-eag-distribution-12

Abstract

   Administrative groups (commonly referred to as "colors" or "link
   colors") are link attributes that are advertised by link state
   protocols like IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and
   OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and used for traffic engineering.
   These administrative groups have initially been defined as a fixed-
   length 32-bit bitmask.  As networks grew and more use-cases were
   introduced, the 32-bit length was found to be constraining and hence
   extended administrative groups were introduced in the link state
   protocols.  The 32-bit administrative groups are already advertised
   as link attributes in BGP-LS (Border Gateway Protocol Link-State).
   This document defines extensions to BGP-LS for advertisement of the
   extended administrative groups.

1.  Introduction

   Administrative groups (commonly referred to as "colors" or "link
   colors") are link attributes that are advertised by link state
   protocols like IS-IS [RFC5305], OSPFv2 [RFC3630] and OSPFv3 [RFC5329]
   for traffic engineering use-cases.  The BGP-LS advertisement is
   encoded using the Administrative Group (color) TLV 1088 as defined in
   [RFC7752].

   These administrative groups are defined as a fixed-length 32-bit
   bitmask.  As networks grew and more use-cases were introduced, the
   32-bit length was found to be constraining and hence extended
   administrative groups (EAG) were introduced in the IS-IS and OSPFv2
   link state routing protocols [RFC7308].

   This document specifies extensions to BGP-LS for advertisement of the
   extended administrative groups.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Advertising Extended Administrative Groups in BGP-LS

   This document defines extensions that enable BGP-LS speakers to
   signal the EAG of links in a network to a BGP-LS consumer of network
   topology such as a centralized controller.  The centralized
   controller can leverage this information in traffic engineering
   computations and other use-cases.  When a BGP-LS speaker is
   originating the topology learnt via link-state routing protocols like
   OSPF or IS-IS, the EAG information of the links is sourced from the
   underlying extensions as defined in [RFC7308].  The BGP-LS speaker
   may also advertise the EAG information for the local links of a node
   when not running any link-state IGP protocol e.g. when running BGP as
   the only routing protocol.

   EAG of a link is encoded in a new Link Attribute TLV [RFC7752] using
   the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Extended Administrative Groups (variable)                 //
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 1: Extended Administrative Groups TLV Format

   Where:

   o  Type: 1173

   o  Length: variable (MUST be multiple of 4); represents the total
      length of the value field in octets.

   o  Value : one or more sets of 32-bit bitmasks that indicate the
      administrative groups (colors) that are enable on the link when
      those specific bits are set.

   The EAG TLV is an optional TLV.  The existing AG TLV 108 and the EAG
   TLV defined in this document MAY be advertised together.  The

   semantics of the EAG and the backward compatibility aspects of EAG
   with respect to the AG are handled as described in the Backward
   Compatibility section of [RFC7308].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning code-point from the registry "BGP-LS
   Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs" based on table below.  Early allocation for these code-points
   have been done by IANA.

    +------------+-------------------------------+-------------------+
    | Code Point |   Description                 | IS-IS TLV/Sub-TLV |
    +------------+-------------------------------+-------------------+
    |   1173     | Extended Administrative Group |      22/14        |
    +------------+-------------------------------+-------------------+


4.  Security Considerations

   The extensions in this document advertise same administrative group
   information specified via [RFC7752] but as a larger/extended value
   and hence does not introduce security issues beyond those discussed
   in [RFC7752].
