            Software-Defined Networking based Policy Driven
			            Network Slicing System
                      draft-kim-nmrg-pdns-02

Abstract

With the advent of Software-Defined Networking(SDN), the network 
environment has changed greatly to focus on users, and network 
virtualization technology has made great progress. However, networks
that are getting bigger and more advanced have become more and more 
complex and difficult to use SDN. In such an environment, a network 
system that users can easily access and use is required. 
In this document we propose a more advanced policy-based network 
virtualization system that allows users to select policies and 
provide networks accordingly, rather than a system that simply 
virtualizes a network and shares it with each user.

1.  Introduction

Recently, the scale of the network is growing rapidly as more and more 
various kinds of devices are being connected. Software-Defined 
Networking(SDN) and network virtualization technology using SDN are 
being studied as a technology for flexible and efficient  management of
such networks, but the larger the networks, the network management with 
SDN becomes more and more complex, which increases the burden on the 
user. In this document, we propose a policy-based network virtualizati-
on system that delivers user packets according to a policy prepared in 
advance by the network administrator for ease of use by users.

2.  SDN-based Network Virtualization

Nowadays SDN has led the change from the existing producer-centered     
networks to the user-centered networks[1]. After the advent of SDN-based
network virtualization technology such as Flowvisor[2], the gap between
the virtual network topology and the real network topology is reduced[3]
,and the network users' conveniene were promoted by integrating the APIs
of the network controllers[4]. However, as the network grows network 
management using SDN becomes more and more complex to respond to changes
in various situations(e.g., loop prevention, ...), which is no exception 
to virtualized networks. As a result, users of the SDN network need a 
lot of time and effort compared to the existing producer-centered 
networks.

3.  Policy-Driven Network Slicing using SDN              

Policy-Driven Network Slicing(PDNS) is designed to maximize the conveni-
ence of network users, which is and advantage of the existing producer
centered network, while ensuring the flexibility of the network using 
SDN. A network administrator who provides a virtual network presents 
various policies (ex. security level, topology, network function) that 
users can use. Network users choose their own policy and use the 
network. The administrator downloads and stores this user-specific 
policy for each OVS, and delivers the user-specific packet to the 
algorithm appropriate to the policy.

 [Figure 1] shows a PDNS system where each switch in the network is 
classified by matching the user's policy. For this classification, the
network adds a policy marker to the user's packet. When each switch 
receives a packet, if the Policy Checker checks whether there is a 
Policy Marker, it delivers the packet according to the corresponding 
policy. If not, packet classifier analyzes which packet is, and policy
matcher compares it with user's DB to determine which policy, add 
policy maker to packet, and deliver packet according to policy. 
If there is a rule, the transmitted packet is transmitted according to
the rule, if not, it is transmitted to the controller and assigned the
rule. The controller refers to the policy marker of the received packet,
and if the packet is delivered from the network to the end user or 
another network last in the relevant policy, it removes the policy 
marker and delivers the packet.
