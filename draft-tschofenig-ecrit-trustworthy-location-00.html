<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>For location-based applications, such as emergency calling or roadside assistance, the
        identity of the requestor is less important than accurate and trustworthy location
        information. 
</p>
<p> A number of protocols are available to supply end systems with either civic or geodetic
        information. For some applications it is an important requirement that location information
        has not been modified in transit or by the end point itself. 
</p>
<p> This document investigates different threats, the adversary model, and outlines three
        possible solutions. The document concludes with a suggestion on how to move forward.

Introduction</h3>

<p> Much of the focus in trustable networks has been on ensuring the reliability of personal
        identity information or verifying privileges. However, in some cases, access to trustworthy
        location information is more important than identity since some services are meant to be
        widely available, regardless of the identity of the requestor. Emergency services, such as
        fire department, ambulance and police, but also commercial services such as food delivery
        and roadside assistance are among those. Customers, competitors or emergency callers lie
        about their location to harm the service provider or to deny services to others, by tying up
        the service capacity. In addition, if third parties can modify the information, they can
        deny services to the requestor. 
</p>
<p> Physical security is often based on location. As a trivial example, light switches in
        buildings are not typically protected by keycards or passwords, but are only accessible to
        those within the perimeter of the building. Merchants processing credit card payments
        already use location information to estimate the risk that a transaction is fraudulent,
        based on the HTTP client's IP address (that is then translated to location). In all these
        cases, trustworthy location information can be used to augment identity information or, in
        some cases, avoid the need for role-based authorization. 
</p>
<p> A number of standardization organizations have developed mechanisms to make civic and
        geodetic location available to the end host. Examples for these protocols are LLDP-MED, DHCP
        extensions (see <a class='info' href='#RFC4776'>[2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6) Option for Civic Addresses Configuration Information,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC3825'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Polk, J., Schnizlein, J., and M. Linsner, &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Option for Coordinate-based Location Configuration Information,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>), HELD (see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barnes, M., Winterbottom, J., Thomson, M., and B. Stark, &ldquo;HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>) or the protocols developed within the
        IEEE as part of their link-layer specifications. The server offering this information is
        usually called a Location Information Server (LIS). In many cases, the end host itself can
        determine its location, e.g., via GPS. The location information is then provided, by
        reference or value, to the service-providing entities, i.e. location recipients, via
        application protocols, such as SIP or HTTP. 
</p>
<p> This document investigates the security threats in <a class='info' href='#threats'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Threats</span><span>)</span></a>, and outlines
        three solutions in <a class='info' href='#solutions'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Solution Proposals</span><span>)</span></a> that should serve as a discussion starter. We
        use emergency services an example to illustrate the security problems and the architectural
        impact, as the problems have been typically discussed in that context since the stakes are
        high, but the issues apply also to other examples as cited earlier.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Emergency Services</h3>

<p>Users of the legacy telephone network can summon emergency services such as ambulance, fire
        and police using a well-known emergency service number (e.g., 9-1-1 in North America, 1-1-2
        in Europe). Location information is used to route emergency calls to the appropriate
        regional Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) that serves the caller to dispatch first-level
        responders to the emergency site. 
</p>
<p> Regulators have already started to demand emergency service support for voice over IP.
        However, enabling such critical public services using the Internet is challenging, as many
        of the assumptions of the PSTN no longer hold. In particular, while the local telephone
        company provides both the physical access and the phone service, VoIP allows and encourages
        to split these two roles between the Access Infrastructure Provider (AIP) and Application
        (Voice) Service Provider (VSP). The VSP may be located far away from the AIP and may either
        have no business relationship with that AIP or may be a competitor. It is also likely that
        the VSP will have no relationship with the PSAP and will therefore be unknown.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Threats</h3>

<p>IP-based emergency calling faces many security threats, most of which are well-known from
        other realms, such as protecting the privacy of communications or against denial-of-service
        attacks using packet flooding. Here, we focus specifically on a higher-layer threat that is
        unique to services where semi-anonymous users can request expensive services. 
</p>
<p> Prank calls have been a problem for emergency services, dating back to the time of street
        corner call boxes. Individual prank calls waste emergency services and possibly endanger
        bystanders or emergency service personnel as they rush to the reported scene of a fire or
        accident. A more recent concern is that massive prank calls can be used to disrupt emergency
        services, e.g., during a mass-casualty event and thus be used as a means to amplify the
        effect of a terror attack, for example. 
</p>
<p>Emergency services have three finite resources subject to denial of service attacks: the
        network and server infrastructure, call takers and dispatchers, and the first responders,
        such as fire fighters and police officers. Protecting the network infrastructure is similar
        to protecting other high-value service providers, except that trustworthy location
        information may be used to filter call setup requests, to weed out requests that are out of
        area. PSAPs even for large cities may only have a handful of PSAP call takers on duty, so
        even if they can, by questioning the caller, eliminate a lot of prank calls, they are
        quickly overwhelmed by even a small-scale attack. Finally, first responder resources are
        scarce, particularly during mass-casualty events. 
</p>
<p> Currently, emergency services rely on the fact that location spoofing is difficult for
        normal users. Additionally, the identity of most callers can be ascertained, so that the
        threat of severe punishments reduces prank calls. Mechanically placing a large number of
        emergency calls that appear to come from different locations is also difficult. Calls from
        payphones are subject to greater scrutiny by the call taker. In the current system, it would
        be very difficult for an attacker from country 'Foo' to attack the emergency services
        infrastructure located in country 'Bar'. 
</p>
<p> One of the main motivations of an adversary in the emergency services context is to
        prevent callers from utilizing emergency service support. This can be done by a variety of
        means, such as impersonating a PSAP or directory servers, attacking SIP signaling elements
        and location servers. 
</p>
<p> Attackers may want to modify, prevent or delay emergency calls. In some cases, this will
        lead the PSAP to dispatch emergency personnel to an emergency that does not exist and,
        hence, the personnel might not be available to other callers. It might also be possible for
        an attacker to impede the users from reaching an appropriate PSAP by modifying the location
        of an end host or the information returned from the mapping protocol. In some countries,
        regulators may not demand authentication of the emergency caller, as is true for PSTN-based
        emergency calls placed from payphones or no-account cell phones today. Furthermore, if
        identities can easily be crafted, then the value of emergency caller authentication might be
        limited. As a consequence, an attacker can forge emergency call information without being
        traced. 
</p>
<p> The above-mentioned attacks are mostly targeting individual emergency callers or a very
        small fraction of them. If attacks are, however, launched against the mapping architecture
        or against PSAP entities, a larger region and a large number of potential emergency callers
        are affected, particularly targeting the call takers at the PSAP. 
</p>
<p> In this context, three adversary models need to be considered: 
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>External adversary model:</dt>
<dd> The end host, e.g., an emergency caller whose
            location is going to be communicated, is honest and the adversary may be located between
            the end host and the location server or between the end host and the PSAP. None of the
            emergency service infrastructure elements act maliciously. 
</dd>
<dt>Malicious infrastructure adversary model:</dt>
<dd> The emergency call routing
            elements, such as the LIS, the LoST infrastructure, used for mapping locations to PSAP
            address, or call routing elements, may act maliciously. 
</dd>
<dt>Malicious end host adversary model:</dt>
<dd> The end host itself acts maliciously,
            whether the owner is aware of this or whether it is acting as a bot.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p>We will focus only on the malicious end host adversary model since it follows today's most
        common adversary model on the Internet that includes bot nets.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Location Spoofing</h3>

<p> An adversary can provide false location information in order to fool the emergency
          personnel. Such an attack is particularly easy if location information is attached to the
          emergency call by the end host and is either not verified or cannot be verified by anyone.
          Only entities that are close to the caller can verify the correctness of location
          information. 
</p>
<p> The following list presents threats specific to location information handling: 
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>

Call Identity Spoofing</h3>

<p> If an adversary can place emergency calls without disclosing its identity, then prank
          calls are more difficult to be traced. There are at least two different forms of
          authentication in this context; network access authentication and authentication of the
          emergency caller at the application layer. This differentiation is created by the split
          between the AIP and the VSP whereby different identities are involved. 
</p>
<p> Trying to find an adversary that did not authenticate itself to the VSP is difficult
          even though there is still a chance that network access authentication was exercised. If
          there is no authentication (neither to the PSAP, to the VSP nor to the AIP) then it is
          very challenging to trace the call back in order to a make a particular entity
          accountable. This might, for example, be the case with an open IEEE 802.11 WLAN access
          point even if the owner of the access point can be determined. 
</p>
<p> However, unlike for the existing telephone system, it is possible to imagine that VoIP
          emergency calls could require strong identity, as providing such identity information is
          not necessarily coupled to having a business relationship with the AIP, ISP or VSP.
          However, due to the time-critical nature of emergency calls, it is unlikely that
          multi-layers authentication can be used, so that in most cases, only the device placing
          the call will be able to be identified, making the system vulnerable to botnet attacks.
          Furthermore, deploying additional credentials for emergency service purposes, such as
          certificates, increases costs, introduces a significant administrative overhead and is
          only useful if widely used.

Location Signing</h3>

<p> One way to avoid location spoofing is to let a trusted location server sign the location
          information before it is sent to the end host, i.e., the entity subject to the location
          determination process. The signed location information is then verified by the location
          recipient and not by the target. <a class='info' href='#fig1'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Location Signing</span><span>)</span></a> shows the communication model with
          the target requesting signed location in step (a), the location server returns it in step
          (b) and it is then conveyed to the location recipient in step (c) who verifies it. For
          SIP, the procedures described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance'>[5]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Polk, J. and B. Rosen, &ldquo;Location Conveyance for the Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> are
          applicable for location conveyance.

</p>
<p>Additional information, such as timestamps or expiration times, has to be included
          together with the signed location to limit replay attacks. If the location is retrieved
          from a location server, even a stationary end host has to periodically obtain a fresh
          signed location, or incur the additional delay of querying during the emergency call. 
</p>
<p> Bot nets are also unlikely to be deterred by location signing. However, accurate
          location information would limit the usable subset of the bot net, as only hosts within
          the PSAP serving area would be useful in placing calls. 
</p>
<p> To prevent location-swapping attacks it is necessary to include some some target
          specific identity information. The included information depends on the purpose, namely
          either real-time verification by the location recipient or for the purpose of a
          post-mortem analysis when the location recipient wants to determine the legal entity
          behind the target for prosecution (if this is possible). As an example, a solution
          proposal is provided by <a class='info' href='#I-D.thomson-geopriv-location-dependability'>[6]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Thomson, M. and J. Winterbottom, &ldquo;Digital Signature Methods for Location Dependability,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p> Still, for large-scale attacks launched by bot nets, this is unlikely to be helpful.
          Location signing is also difficult when the host provides its own location via GPS, which
          is likely to be a common occurrence for mobile devices. Trusted computing approaches, with
          tamper-proof GPS modules, may be needed in that case. After all, a device can always
          pretend to have a GPS device and the recipient has no way of verifying this or forcing
          disclosure of non-GPS-derived location information. 
</p>
<p> Location verification may be most useful if it is used in conjunction with other
          mechanisms. For example, a call taker can verify that the region that corresponds to the
          IP address of the media stream roughly corresponds to the location information reported by
          the caller. To make the use of bot nets more difficult, a CAPTCHA-style test may be
          applied to suspicious calls, although this idea is quite controversial for emergency
          services, at the danger of delaying or even rejecting valid calls.

Location by Reference</h3>

<p> The location-by-reference concept was developed so that end hosts could avoid having to
          periodically query the location server for up-to-date location information in a mobile
          environment. Additionally, if operators do not want to disclose location information to
          the end host without charging them, location-by-reference provides a reasonable
          alternative.

          resolve the reference with a request in step (d). Finally, location information is

</p>
<p> The details for the dereferencing operations vary with the type of reference, such as a

            <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barnes, M., Winterbottom, J., Thomson, M., and B. Stark, &ldquo;HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> is an example of a protocol
          that is able to return such references. 
</p>
<p> For location-by-reference, the location server needs to maintain one or several URIs for
          each target, timing out these URIs after a certain amount of time. References need to
          expire to prevent the recipient of such a URL from being able to permanently track a host
          and to offer garbage collection functionality for the location server. 
</p>
<p> Off-path adversaries must be prevented from obtaining the target's location. The
          reference contains a randomized component that prevents third parties from guessing it.
          When the location recipient fetches up-to-date location information from the location
          server, it can also be assured that the location information is fresh and not replayed.
          However, this does not address location swapping. 
</p>
<p> However, location-by-reference does not offer significant security benefits if the end
          host uses GPS to determine its location. At best, a network provider can use cell tower or
          triangulation information to limit the inaccuracy of user-provided location information.

Proxy Adding Location</h3>

<p> Instead of making location information available to the end host, it is possible to
          allow an entity in the AIP, or associated with the AIP, to retrieve the location
          information on behalf of the end point. This solution is possible when the application
          layer messages are routed through an entity with the ability to determine the location
          information of the end point, for example based on the end host's IP or MAC address. 
</p>
<p> When the untrustworthy end host does not have the ability to access location
          information, it cannot modify it either. Proxies can use various techniques, including SIP
          Identity, to ensure that modifications to the location in transit can be detected by the
          location recipient (e.g., the PSAP). As noted above, this is unlikely to work for
          GPS-based location determination techniques. 
</p>
<p> The obvious disadvantage of this approach is that there is a need to deploy application
          layer entities, such as SIP proxies, at AIPs or associated with AIPs. In case of devices
          that lack credentials or are unauthorized to access certain networks the procedures
          described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-unauthenticated-access'>[7]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., McCann, S., Bajko, G., Tschofenig, H., and D. Kroeselberg, &ldquo;Extensions to the Emergency Services Architecture for dealing with Unauthenticated and Unauthorized Devices,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> may very well
          be aligned with such an approach. Finally, it has to be noted that routing emergency calls
          through SIP proxies in the AIP closely matches the approaches favored by the 3GPP in their
          IMS emergency architecture.

Conclusion</h3>

<p> Emergency services raise a number of architectural questions,
        see~\cite{draft-ietf-ecrit-framework}. With the generalized emergency architecture
        considered within the ECRIT working group various security challenges need to be addressed,
        including the ability to report faked location and other attacks against the emergency
        services infrastructure. These types of attacks also show that the attack characteristics
        play an important role when dealing with the problems and lower-layer solutions, as they
        have been proposed as solutions to generic Denial of Service prevention (for example using
        cryptographic puzzles), have limited applicability. 
</p>
<p>Although it is important to ensure that location information cannot be faked there will be
        a larger number of GPS-enabled devices out there that make it difficult to utilize any of
        the security mechanisms described in <a class='info' href='#solutions'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Solution Proposals</span><span>)</span></a>. It will be very unlikely
        that end users will upload their location information for "verification" to a nearby
        location server located in the access network. When location is obtained from the network
        then there one mechanism, namely Location by Reference, is currently being specified already
        to offer a high degree of security protection. In addition, it is extremely important to
        stress the need for a strong identity mechanism that allows user's to be traced back and to
        hold them responsible for their actions.
