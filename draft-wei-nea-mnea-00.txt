Abstract

   A method for mutual network endpoint assessment is introduced in this
   document.  In current NEA requirements, only the assessment performed
   by network owner is described.  However, for some applications like
   online business and file sharing, the unilateral assessment is not
   enough to ensure the two communication parties are both secure
   Especially in P2P application, the endpoints perform equal
   responsibility and hence the mutual network endpoint assessment seems

   more necessary. each endpoint may configure its security assessment
   policy based on its own security concerns. .

Internet-Draft     Mutual Network Endpoint Assessment      November 2007


1.  Introduction

   In Current NEA architecture, network owner collects the posture
   information of the network endpoint via the nea client, judge the
   compliance with the security policy and then makes a decision about
   the access request according to the assessment result.  Only those
   endpoints that are compliant with the security policy can access the
   network; while, those who are not compliant can not access the
   network&#65292;instead by following the updating instruction.  This
   method only describes how the network owner perform the assessment of
   network endpoints unilaterally.  However, in some cases, such as P2P
   applications, each endpoint acts as a server and a client of its peer
   simultaneously and hence each of them should collect and then assess
   the posture information from the peer.  As a complementarity of the
   current NEA, this document defines such mutual assessment method. .


2.  Reference Model

   In mutual Network Endpoint Assessment reference model&#65292;every
   network endpoint can perform the assessment of the peer as well as
   can assist the peer in assessing itself.  Therefore, every endpoint
   can decide whether or not to continue the subsequent interaction
   according to the peer's compliance with its security policy.  The
   mutual Network Endpoint Assessment reference model is shown as
   following figure.  PA, PB and PT layer is the same as the current NEA
   model.  Posture Peer(PP) has the function of both PC and PV; Posture
   Broker peer(PBP) has the function of both PBC and PBS; Posture
   Transport Peer(PTP) has the function of both PTS and PTC.

3.  Use Case

   Mutual assessment can normally be triggered by some certain network
   application.Each endpoint participating in these applications, such
   as online business and file sharing, should disclose its posture
   information to its communicating peer for further assessment.  The
   mutual NEA procedure is shown as following figure.

1. Endpoint A connects to the Endpoint B.
2. The PBP on EndpointB (B-PBP) is notified of the request from Endpoint A.
3. The B-PBP contacts those local Posture Peers (B-PPs). According to the
   security policy, each B-PP responds a Posture Request (ReqB) to indicate
   what posture information the Endpoint A should provide.
4. The B-PBP multiplexes all ReqBs from the B-PPs into one PB message and
   sends it to the Posture Broker Peer on the endpoint A(A-PBP) via the PTP
   on Endpoint B and Endpoint A(i.e. B-PTP and A-PTP).
5. The PBP on Endpoint A (A-PBP) de-multiplexes the PB message and delivers
   each ReqB to its corresponding PP on Endpoint A(A-PP).
6. As requested by B-PP?each involved A-PP returns its posture information
  (PosA) with the permission of the Endpoint A?s privacy policy. At the
  same time, each A-PP responds a Posture Request (ReqA) to indicate what
   posture information the Endpoint B should provide.
7. The A-PBP multiplexes all ReqAs and PosAs from the A-PP into one PB
   message and sends it to the B-PBP.
8. B-PBP de-multiplexes the PB message and delivers each ReqA and PosA to
   its corresponding B-PP.
9. Each B-PP assesses its received PosA according to the security policy
   and   returns its assessment result(ResB). (Note: In this case, the
   Endpoint A is compliant with the security policy of Endpoint B). At the
   same time, each B-PP returns the related posture information (PosB)
   requested by A-PP with the permission of the Endpoint B?s privacy policy.
10. The B-PBP multiplexes all ResBs and PosBs from the B-PP into one PB
    message and sends it to A-PBP via B-PTP and A-PTP.
11. A-PBP de-multiplexes the PB message and delivers each PosB and ResB to
    the corresponding A-PP.
12. Each A-PP assesses the received PosB according to the security policy
    and returns the assessment result(ResA). Note: In this case, the
    Endpoint B is compliant with the security policy of Endpoint A.
13. The A-PBP multiplexes all ResAs from A-PP into one PB messages and sends
    it to B-PBP via A-PTP and B-PTP.
14. The B-PBP de-multiplexes the PB messages and delivers each ResA to the
    corresponding B-PP.
15. After the mutual assessment, both Endpoint A and Endpoint B can ensure
    that the peer is compliant with its own security policy and hence then
    subsequent interaction is allowed.
