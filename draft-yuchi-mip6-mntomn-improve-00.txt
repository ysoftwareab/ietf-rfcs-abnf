1. Introduction 

   The Mobile IPv6 base protocol does not specially specify the 
   communication procedure between two mobile nodes. According to the 
   procedure defined for mobile node and correspondent node, the 
   communication between two mobile nodes MN1 and MN2 can be described 
   as follows: 

   o Mode1: Both MN1 and MN2 are at home. They communicate with each 
      other using conventional Internet routing mechanisms. 

   o Mode2: One is at home and one is away from home. Their 
      communication procedure is same as the procedure between a mobile 
      node and a stationary correspondent node.

   o Mode3: Both MN1 and NM2 are away from home, and finish home 
      registration respectively. If they don't register their care-of 
      address with each other, then they communicate with each other 
      using bidirectional tunneling mode. Packets from MN1 are routed to 
      its home agent, then routed to the home agent of MN2, and finally 
      tunneled to the care-of address of MN2. Packets from MN2 to MN1 
      use the reverse procedure.  

   o Mode4: MN1 is away from home first and finishes home registration, 
      it then initiates a correspondent registration for MN2 which acts 
      as correspondent node now. MN2 moves to foreign link subsequently 
      and finishes home registration, then it may initiate a 
      correspondent registration for MN1. Finally, MN1 and MN2 can 
      communicate using route optimization. 

   A mobile node has dual nature when it communicates with another 
   mobile node. Sometimes its role is mobile node, and sometimes its 
   role is correspondent node. For this reason, communication between 
   mobile nodes has additional complexity when using the third and 
   fourth modes, as described above. 

   This document specifies a solution to improve the fourth mode. How to 
   improve the third mode is beyond the scope of this specification. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

 
   This document uses terminology specific to Mobile IPv6 as defined 
   in section "Terminology" of RFC 3775. 
    

3. Overview of the solution 

3.1. Mobile Correspondent Node 

   In order to differentiate between the two communicating mobile nodes, 
   a new concept called "mobile correspondent node" is introduced. The 
   initiator of a correspondent registration acts as a mobile node, and 
   the receiver acts as a mobile correspondent node. The receiver SHOULD 
   NOT initiate a correspondent registration for the initiator, and both 
   sides SHOULD maintain this relationship in future communication. A 
   mobile correspondent node SHOULD inform the mobile node of its new

   address, when it moves to a new link. The method for doing this is 
   specified below. 

3.2. Binding Refresh Request Message 

   A Binding Refresh Request (BRR) is used by a correspondent node to 
   request a mobile node to re-establish its binding with the 
   correspondent node.  This message is typically used when the cached 
   binding is in active use but the binding's lifetime is close to 
   expiration. In this solution, this message is extended to inform the 
   mobile node of a correspondent node's address when its address has 
   changed or will change.  

3.3. Correspondent Address Option 

    A new option called "Correspondent Address Option" is defined for 
    the BRR message. This option is used to carry the correspondent 
    address and its format is: 
     
       0                   1                   2                   3 
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
                                       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                                       |   Type = TBD    |  Length = 16| 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |                                                               | 
       +                                                               + 
       |                                                               | 
       +                   Correspondent Address                       + 
       |                                                               | 
       +                                                               + 
       |                                                               | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
      

4. Protocol Operations 

4.1. Home Agent Operations 

   The home agent's operations are according to [2].

4.2. Mobile Correspondent Node Operations 

   Due to movement, reconfiguration, or other reason, a correspondent 
   node's address may change. As a result, the correspondent node SHOULD 
   send a BRR message to the mobile node. If a correspondent node sends 
   BRR message after its address has changed, this option contains its 
   previous address; otherwise this option contains its prospective 
   address. Obtaining a prospective address is according to [3]. 

4.3. Mobile Node Operations 

   When a mobile node receives a BRR message containing a correspondent 
   address option and the mobile node has a Binding Update List entry 
   for the address carried by the option, then the mobile node should 
   start the return routability procedure which is sent to the source of 
   the BRR message. If the mobile node has a Binding Update List entry 
   for the source of the BRR, then the mobile node should start the 
   return routability procedure which is sent to the address carried by 
   the correspondent address option. 

   Other operations of the mobile node are according to [2]. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to assign a mobility option code for the 
   correspondent address option. 

6. Security Considerations 

   Section 15 of [RFC 3775] outlines the Mobile IPv6 security 
   considerations. This option does not change these in any significant 
   way. Detailed security of this option will be considered in future.
