                    Encryption Mechanism for DHCPv6
                   draft-cui-dhc-dhcpv6-encryption-04

Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables
   DHCPv6 servers to configure network parameters dynamically.  However,
   due to the unsecured nature, various critical identifiers used in
   DHCPv6 are vulnerable to several types of attack.  In order to
   protect the DHCPv6 from passive attack, such as pervasive monitoring
   attack, this document provides a mechanism to achieve the encryption
   between the DHCPv6 client and server.

1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [RFC3315] enables
   DHCPv6 servers to configure network parameters dynamically.  Due to
   the unsecured nature of DHCPv6, the various critical identifiers are
   vulnerable to several types of attacks, particularly pervasive
   monitoring (PM) [RFC7258].  [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-privacy] analyses
   the DHCPv6 privacy issues and discusses how various identifiers used
   in DHCPv6 could become a source for gleaning additional information
   of an individual.  The IETF has expressed strong agreement that PM is
   an attack that needs to be mitigated where possible in [RFC7258].

   Prior work has addressed some aspects of DHCPv6 security, but until
   now there has been little work to protect the DHCPv6 from passive
   attack, such as pervasive monitoring attack.  Secure DHCPv6
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6] provides the authentication mechanism between
   DHCPv6 client and server along with the DHCPv6 transaction.  However,
   the DHCPv6 message is still transmitted in clear text and the private
   information within the DHCPv6 message is not protected from pervasive
   monitoring.  Anonymity profile for DHCP clients
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-anonymity-profile] provides guidelines on the
   composition of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 request to minimize the disclosure of

   identifying information.  However, anonymity profile limits the use
   of the certain options and cannot protect all identifiers used in
   DHCP if new option containing some private information is defined.
   In addition, the anonymity profile cannot work in some situation
   where the client wants anonymity to attackers but not to the valid
   DHCP server.  Besides, a separate encryption mechanism such as DTLS
   is also infeasible for DHCPv6, because the DHCPv6 relay can not
   recognize the 'secure' DHCPv6 message and may drop the DTLS messages.

   The proposed solution provides a mechanism to achieve the encryption
   between the DHCPv6 client and server in order to protect the DHCPv6
   from passive attack, such as pervasive monitoring.  Before the DHCPv6
   configuration process, the Information-request and Reply messages
   exchange is used to inform the client of the server's public key.
   After the public key exchange, the following DHCPv6 messages are
   encrypted and encapsulated into two newly defined DHCPv6 messages:
   Encrypted-Query and Encrypted-Response.  In this way, the various
   identifiers contained in DHCPv6 message are protected from passive
   attack.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Solution Overview

   In the proposed solution, the server's public key is communicated to
   the client before the standard DHCPv6 transactions.  Once the client
   gets notified with the public key, the successive DHCPv6
   configuration process can be encrypted with the recipient's public
   key.  The encrypted DHCPv6 messages are put into the newly defined
   DHCPv6 option: encrypted-message option, and encapsulated into the
   two new DHCPv6 messages: Encrypted-Query and Encrypted-Response.
   This mechanism is used for the stateful DHCPv6 process starting with
   a SOLICIT message and the stateless DHCPv6 process starting with an
   Information-request message.

   This solution is based on the public/private key pairs of the DHCPv6
   client and server.  The client/server firstly generates a pair of
   public/private keys.  The solution adds the Information-request and
   Reply messages exchange before the standard DHCPv6 configuration
   process.  The information-request message is used by the client to
   obtain the server's public key information without having addresses
   assigned to it.  The DHCPv6 client firstly multicasts an Information-
   request message to DHCPv6 servers.  The client MUST request the
   encryption public key option in the Option Request option.  When

   receiving the Information-request message with the request for
   encryption public key, the server sends the Reply message that
   contains the server's public key option and server identifier option.
   Upon the receipt of the Reply message, the DHCPv6 client records the
   server's DUID as well as the corresponding public key.  If the client
   receives multiple Reply messages, the client selects one DHCPv6
   server for the following network parameters configuration.

   After the server's public key notification, the following DHCPv6
   exchanges are encrypted with the recipient's public key and
   encapsulated into the encrypted-message option.  For the stateful/
   stateless scenario, the Solicit/Information-request message MUST
   contain the public key option to communicate the client's public key.
   The client sends the Encrypted-Query message to server, which carries
   the server identifier option and the encrypted-message option.  The
   DHCPv6 server replies with the Encrypted-Response message to client,
   which contains the encrypted-message option.  The following figure
   illustrates the DHCPv6 encryption procedure of the client-server
   exchanges involving four messages.

                        DHCPv6 Encryption Procedure

4.  Client Behavior

   If the client supports the encryption mode, it MUST generate a
   public/private key pair.  For the client supporting the encryption
   mode, it multicasts the Information-request message to the DHCPv6
   servers.  The Information-request message MUST NOT include any option
   which may reveal the private information of the client, such as the
   client identifier option.  The client MUST include an Option Request
   option to request the encryption public key option.

   When the DHCPv6 client receives the Reply messages, the client MUST
   discard the those that do not contain the encryption public key
   option or the sever identifier option.  Upon the receipt of the Reply
   message, the DHCPv6 client records the server's DUID as well as the
   corresponding public key.  If the client receives multiple Reply
   messages, the client selects one DHCPv6 server for the following

Internet-Draft              DHCPv6 Encryption               October 2015


   network parameters configuration.

   Once the server's public key is informed, the DHCPv6 client sends the
   Encrypted-Query message to the DHCPv6 server.  The Encrypted-Query
   message is constructed with the encrypted-message option and server
   identifier option.  The encrypted-message option contains the DHCPv6
   message that is encrypted using the selected server's public key.
   The server identifier option is externally visible to avoid extra
   cost by those unselected servers.  The Solicit/Information-request
   message MUST contain the public key option for the client's public
   key exchange.

   For the received Encrypted-Response message, the client extracts the
   encrypted-message option and decrypts it using its private key to
   obtain the original DHCPv6 message.  Then it handles the message as
   per [RFC3315].  If the client fails to get the proper parameters from
   the chosen server, it sends the Encrypted-Query message to another
   authenticated server for parameters configuration until the client
   obtains the proper parameters.

5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   When a DHCPv6 relay agent receives an Encrypted-query or Encrypted-
   response message, it may not recognize this message.  The unknown
   messages MUST be forwarded as describes in [RFC7283].

   When a DHCPv6 relay agent recognizes the Encrypted-query and
   Encrypted-response messages, it forwards the message according to
   section 20 of [RFC3315].

6.  Server Behavior

   When the DHCPv6 server receives the Information-request message with
   encryption public key option request, it replies the Reply message to
   the client, which includes the encryption public key option and
   server identifier option.

   Upon the receipt of Encrypted-Query message, the server checks the
   server identifier option.  It decrypts the encrypted-message option
   using its private key if it is the target server.  The DHCPv6 server
   drops the message that is not for it, thus not paying cost to decrypt
   the message.  If the decrypted message is the Solicit/Information-
   request message, the server MSUT discard the decrypted message that
   does not include the encryption public key option.  The server is
   informed of the client's public through the encryption public key
   option contained in the Solicit/Information-request message.

   After the server is informed of the client's public key, the DHCPv6

   messages, which is sent from server to client, is encrypted using the
   client's public key.  The encrypted DHCPv6 message is encapsulated
   into the encrypted-message option.  The Encrypted-Response message
   contains the encrypted-message option.
