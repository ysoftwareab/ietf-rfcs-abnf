2.  Introduction

   This memo defines an portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed
   objects to configure and/or monitor Multi-protocol Label
   Switching Layer-3 Virtual Private Networks on a
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switching Router 
   (LSR) supporting this feature.

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC2547bis]. Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of
   [RFC2547bis] apply and will not be re-described here.

   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   mpls@uu.net and the Layer-3 VPN (L3VPN) WG at l3vpn@ietf.org.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].
   
3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS



Nadeau & van Der Linde        Expires October 31, 2005       [Page 2]

Internet Draft            MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB            April 1, 2005



   architecture [RFC3031] and from the document describing MPLS Layer-3
   VPNs (L3VPN) [RFC2547bis], as well as the MPLS architecture 
   [RFC3031].
   
   Throughout this document, the use of the terms "Provider Edge (PE)
   and Customer Edge (CE) or PE/CE" will be replaced by PE in all cases
   except when a network device is a CE when used in the carrier of
   carriers model.

4. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].



5.  Assumptions and Prerequisites

   It is assumed that certain things are configured and operational in
   order for the tables and objects described in this MIB to function
   correctly. These things are outlined below:
   
   - MPLS in general, must be configured and operational.
   
   - LDP paths or traffic engineered tunnels [RFC3812] should be 
     configured between PEs and CEs.
   
6.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
   contained in the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB.

6.1  mplsL3VpnVrfTable

   This table represents the MPLS L3VPNs that are configured.
   A Network Management System (NMS) or SNMP agent creates an
   entry in this table for every MPLS L3VPN configured on
   the LSR being examined.  The VRF that is configured at
   a particular device represents an instance of some VPN, but



Nadeau & van Der Linde        Expires October 31, 2005       [Page 3]

Internet Draft            MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB            April 1, 2005



   not the entire VPN (unless it is the only VRF, of course). 
   The collective set of VRF instances comprises the actual 
   VPN. This information is typically only known in its entirety 
   at the NMS. That is, specific devices generally only know
   of their local VRF information, but not that of other LSRs'
   VRFs.

6.2  mplsL3VpnIfConfTable

   This table represents the MPLS L3VPN-enabled interfaces
   that are associated with a specific VRF as represented in
   the aforementioned mplsL3VpnVrfTable. Each entry in this table 
   corresponds to an entry in the Interfaces MIB. In addition, 
   each entry extends its corresponding entry in the Interface 
   MIB to contain specific MPLS L3VPN information. Due to this
   correspondence, certain objects such as traffic counters
   are not found in this MIB to avoid overlap, but instead
   are found in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

6.3  mplsL3VpnVrfPerfTable

   This table contains objects to measure the performance of
   MPLS L3VPNs and augments the mplsL3VpnVrfTable. High
   capacity counters are provided for objects that are likely
   to wrap around quickly on objects such as high-speed interface
   counters.

6.4  mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable

   The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor
   routes used by a particular VRF.  This includes a cross-connect
   pointer into the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB's mplsXCTable, which may be
   used to refer that entry to its label stack used to label 
   switch that entry.

6.5  MplsVpnVrfRTTable

   The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor
   route targets for a particular VRF.

7. Example of MPLS L3VPN Setup

   In this section, we provide a brief example of using the MIB
   objects described in the following section. While this example
   is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is intended
   as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  It is our
   intent that it is read only after the reader has gone through
   the MIB itself.

   This configuration is under the assumption that 1) MPLS has been 
   pre-configured in the network, through enabling LDP or RSVP-TE. 
   2) OSPF or ISIS has been pre-configured. 3) BGP sessions have been
   established between PEs.

   Defining the VRF, the route target and route distinguisher:

   In mplsL3VpnVrfTable:
   {
     mplsL3VpnVrfName               = "RED",
     mplsL3VpnVrfDescription        = "Intranet of Company ABC",
     mplsL3VpnVrfRD                 = "100:1", -- octet string
     mplsL3VpnVrfRowStatus          = createAndGo(4)
   }

   In mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable:
   {
     mplsL3VpnVrfRTRowStatus."Red"."100:1".import = createAndGo,
     mplsL3VpnVrfRTRowStatus."Red"."100:1".export = createAndGo
   }

       "This notification is generated only after the number of routes
        contained by the specified VRF exceeds or attempts to exceed
        the maximum allowed value as indicated by
        mplsVrfMaxRouteThreshold, and then falls below this value. The
        emission of this notification informs the operator that the
        error condition has been cleared without the operator having to
        query the device. 

        Note that mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime denotes the interval at 
        which the the mplsNumVrfRouteMaxThreshExceeded notification will 
        be re-issued after the maximum value has been exceeded (or 
        reached if mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and 
        mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are equal) and the initial 
        notification has been issued. Therefore,
        the generation of this notification should also be emitted with 
        this same frequency (assuming that the error condition is 
        cleared). Specifically, if the error condition is reached and 
        cleared several times during the period of time specified in 
        mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime, only a single notification will 
        be issued to indicate the first instance of the error condition 
        as well as the first time the error condition is cleared. 
        This behavior is intended to prevent continuous generation of 
        notifications by an agent in the event that routes are 
        continually added and removed to/from a VRF after it has 
        reached its maximum value. The default value is 0. If this value 
        is set to 0, the agent should issue a notification whenever the 
        maximum threshold has been cleared."

16. Security Considerations

   It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for 
   monitoring of MPLS LSRs supporting L3 MPLS VPN.  This
   MIB module can also be used for configuration of certain objects, 
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured, 
   with potentially disastrous results.
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable, mplsL3VpnIfConfTable and 
        mplsL3VpnVrfTable tables collectively 
        contain objects which may be used to provision MPLS VRF
        interfaces and configuration.  Unauthorized access to objects 
        in these tables, could result in disruption of traffic on the 
        network.  This is especially true if these VRFs have been 
        previously provisioned and are in use. The use of stronger 
        mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where 
        possible.  Specifically,
        SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which
        implements this MIB module.  Administrators should consider 
        whether read access to these objects should be allowed, 
        since read access may be undesirable under certain 
        circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly



Nadeau & van Der Linde       Expires October 31, 2005       [Page 41]

Internet Draft            MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB            April 1, 2005



   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsL3VpnVrfTable, mplsL3VpnIfConfTable tables 
        collectively show the VRF interfaces and 
        associated VRF configurations as well as their linkages to other
        MPLS-related configuration and/or performanc statistics. 
        Administrators not wishing to reveal this information should
        consider these objects sensitive/vulnerable and take 
        precautions so they are not revealed.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

18.  IANA Considerations

   As described in MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related 
   standards track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB 
   subtree. There is one MPLS-related
   MIB module contained in this document. Each of the following "IANA
   Considerations" subsections requests IANA for a new assignment under
   the mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].

18.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB 11 } to the 
   MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB module specified in this document.
