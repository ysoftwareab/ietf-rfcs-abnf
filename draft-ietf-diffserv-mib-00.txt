	  Abstract

	  This memo describes a	proposed MIB for the Differentiated
	  Services Architecture.

	  1.  Status of	this Memo

	  This document	is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance
	  with all provisions of Section 10 of RFC 2026. Internet-Drafts
	  are working documents	of the Internet	Engineering Task Force
	  (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that	other
	  groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
	  Drafts.

	  Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for	a maximum of six
	  months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
	  documents at any time.  It is	inappropriate to use Internet
	  Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as
	  "work	in progress."

	  The list of current Internet-Drafts can be accessed at
	  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt

	  The list of Internet-Draft Shadow Directories	can be accessed
	  at http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html.

	  This particular draft	is being developed in the Differentiated
	  Services Working Group. Discussion of	it therefore belongs on
	  that list. The charter for Differentiated Services may be
	  found	at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/diffserv-
	  charter.html

	  2.  The SNMP Management Framework

	  The SNMP Management Framework	presently consists of five major
	  components:

	      o	  An overall architecture, described in	RFC 2571 [1].

	      o	  Mechanisms for describing and	naming objects and
		  events for the purpose of management.	The first
		  version of this Structure of Management Information

	  Draft		   Differentiated Services MIB	       July 1999


		  (SMI)	is called SMIv1	and described in RFC 1155 [2],
		  RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
		  called SMIv2,	is described in	RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579
		  [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

	      o	  Message protocols for	transferring management
		  information. The first version of the	SNMP message
		  protocol is called SNMPv1 and	described in RFC 1157
		  [8]. A second	version	of the SNMP message protocol,
		  which	is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
		  called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
		  1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol
		  is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC	1906 [10], RFC
		  2572 [11] and	RFC 2574 [12].

	      o	  Protocol operations for accessing management
		  information. The first set of	protocol operations and
		  associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1157 [8]. A
		  second set of	protocol operations and	associated PDU
		  formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

	      o	  A set	of fundamental applications described in RFC
		  2573 [14] and	the view-based access control mechanism
		  described in RFC 2575	[15].

	  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
	  Framework can	be found in RFC	2570 [16].

	  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
	  termed the Management	Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
	  MIB are defined using	the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

	  This memo specifies a	MIB module that	is compliant to	the
	  SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through
	  the appropriate translations.	The resulting translated MIB
	  must be semantically equivalent, except where	objects	or
	  events are omitted because no	translation is possible	(use of
	  Counter64). Some machine-readable information	in SMIv2 will be
	  converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the
	  translation process. However,	this loss of machine readable
	  information is not considered	to change the semantics	of the
	  MIB.

	  3.  Structure	of this	MIB

	  This MIB is designed according to the	Differentiated Services
	  implementation conceptual model documented in	[Model].

	  3.1.	Overview

	  In principle,	if one were to construct a network entirely out
	  of two-port routers (in appropriate places connected by LANs
	  or similar media), then it would be necessary	for each router
	  to perform exactly four QoS control functions	on traffic in
	  each direction:

	  -    Classify	each message according to some set of rules

	  -    In edge devices,	determine whether the data stream the
	       message is part of is within or outside its rate

	  -    Perform some set	of resulting actions, minimally
	       including applying a drop policy	appropriate to the
	       classification and queue	in question, and in edge devices
	       perhaps additionally marking the	traffic	with a
	       Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) as defined in
	       [DSCP].

	  -    Enqueue the traffic for output in the appropriate queue,
	       which may shape the traffic or simply forward it	with
	       some minimum rate or maximum latency.

	  If we	build the network out of N-port	routers, we expect the
	  behavior of the network to be	identical. We are forced,
	  therefore, to	provide	essentially the	same set of functions on
	  the ingress port of a	router as on the egress	port of	a
	  router. Some interfaces will be "edge" interfaces and	some
	  will be "interior" to	the Differentiated Services domain. The
	  one point of difference between an ingress and an egress
	  interface is that all	traffic	on an egress interface is
	  queued, while	traffic	on an ingress interface	will typically
	  be queued only for shaping purposes.

	  Hence, in this MIB, we model them identically, making	the
	  distinction between ingress and egress interfaces an index
	  variable.

	  The MIB therefore contains five elements:
	  - Behavior Aggregate Classification Table
	  - Classifier Table





	  Fred Baker	     Expiration: January 2000		[Page 3]





	  Draft		   Differentiated Services MIB	       July 1999


	  - Meter Table
	  - Action Table
	  - Queue Table

	  3.2.	Behavior Aggregate Classification Table

	  The Behavior Aggregate Classification	Table is present for
	  several reasons. First, the DSCP must	be identified somewhere
	  for identifying tagged streams of traffic. This could	be done
	  in-line, and is not.

	  The reason the BA Classifier is pulled out into a separate
	  table	is that	we envisage the	use of other tables for	other
	  kinds	of classifiers,	public or proprietary. For example, the
	  typical "five-tuple" used in per-flow	classification (as in
	  RSVP)	might be represented by	a table	whose objects include
	  the necessary	IP Addresses, the IP protocol, the necessary
	  TCP/UDP port numbers,	and a RowStatus	variable. By pulling the
	  classifier itself into a table that can be referenced	via a
	  RowPointer, we enable	the use	of any sort of classification
	  table	that one might wish to design. That classifier table
	  need not be found in this MIB. When ambiguity	is present, we
	  disambiguate by explicitly ordering the application of
	  classification rules.

	  3.3.	Classifier Table

	  The classifier table,	now, indicates how traffic is sorted
	  out. It identifies separable classes of traffic, by reference
	  to an	appropriate classifier,	which may be anything from an
	  individual micro-flow	to aggregates identified by DSCP.  It
	  then sends these classified streams to an appropriate	meter or
	  action. In a multi-stage meter, sub-classes of traffic may be
	  sent to different stages. For	example, in AF1, AF11 traffic
	  might	be sent	to the first meter, AF12 traffic might be sent
	  to the second, and AF13 traffic sent to the second meter
	  stage's failure action.

	  The structure	of the classifier table	is a sequence of
	  unambiguous tests. Within each step in the sequence, it should
	  not be important in order - if order is present at all - the
	  tests	are made. This is to facilitate	optimized
	  implementations such as index	trees. Sequence	is present in
	  order	to resolve ambiguity.

	  For example, one might want first to disallow	certain
	  applications from using the network at all, or to classify





	  Fred Baker	     Expiration: January 2000		[Page 4]





	  Draft		   Differentiated Services MIB	       July 1999


	  some individual traffic streams that are not diff-serv marked.
	  Traffic that fails those tests might then be inspected for a
	  DSCP.	"Then" implies sequence, and the sequence must be
	  somehow specified.

	  An important form of classifier is "everything else".	The
	  final	stage of the classifier	should be configured to	be
	  complete, as the result of an	incomplete classifier is not
	  necessarily deterministic.

	  3.4.	Meter Table

	  A meter, according to	the conceptual model, measures the rate
	  at which a stream of traffic passes it, compares it to some
	  set of thresholds, and produces some number (two or more)
	  potential results. A given message is	said to	"conform" to the
	  meter	if at the time that the	message	is being looked	at the
	  stream appears to be within the meter's limit	rate. In the
	  MIB, the structure of	SNMP makes it easiest to implement this
	  as a set of one or more simple pass/fail tests, which	are
	  cascaded. It is to be	understood that	the meter in a Traffic
	  Control Block	is therefore implemented as a set of if-then-
	  else constructs.

	  The result of	metering traffic is always some	action.

	  The concept of conformance to	a meter	bears a	comment. The
	  concept applied in several rate-control architectures,
	  including ATM, Frame Relay, Integrated Services, and
	  Differentiated Services, is variously	described as a "leaky
	  bucket" or a "token bucket".

	  A leaky bucket algorithm is primarily	used for traffic
	  shaping: traffic theoretically departs from the switch at a
	  flat rate of one bit every so	many time units, and in	fact
	  departs in packets at	a rate approximating that. It is also
	  possible to build multi-rate leaky buckets, in which traffic
	  departs from the switch at varying rates depending on	recent
	  activity or inactivity.

	  A token bucket is used to measure the	behavior of a peer's
	  leaky	bucket,	for verification purposes. It is, by definition,
	  a relationship

			    interval = burst/rate, or
			      rate = burst/interval






	  Fred Baker	     Expiration: January 2000		[Page 5]





	  Draft		   Differentiated Services MIB	       July 1999


	  for some defined burst size, in bits,	rate, in bits per
	  second, and time interval. Multi-rate	token buckets (token
	  buckets with both a peak and a mean rate, and	sometimes more
	  rates) are commonly used. In this case, the burst size for the
	  baseline traffic is conventionally referred to as the
	  "committed burst", and the time interval is as specified by

		       interval	= committed burst/mean rate

	  but additional burst sizes (each an increment	over its
	  predecessor) are defined, which are conventionally referred to
	  as "excess" burst sizes.  The	peak rate therefore equals the
	  sum of the burst sizes per interval.

	  A data stream	is said	to "conform" to	a simple token bucket if
	  the switch receives at most the burst	size in	a given	time
	  interval. In the multi-rate case, the	traffic	is said	to
	  conform to the token bucket at a given level if its rate does
	  not exceed the sum of	the relevant burst sizes in a given
	  interval. Received traffic pre-classified at one of the
	  "excess" rates (e.g.,	AF12 or	AF13 traffic) is only compared
	  to the relevant excess buckets.

	  The fact that	data is	organized into variable	length packets
	  introduces some uncertainty in this. For this	reason,	the
	  token	bucket accepts a packet	if any of its bits would have
	  been accepted, and "borrows" any excess capacity required from
	  that allotted	to equivalently	classified traffic in a
	  subsequent interval. More information	about this is available
	  in [Model].

	  Multiple classes of traffic, as identified by	the classifier
	  table, may be	presented to the same meter. Imagine, for
	  example, that	we desire to drop all traffic that uses	any DSCP
	  that has not been publicly defined.  A classifier entry might
	  exist	for each such DSCP, shunting it	to an "accepts
	  everything" meter, and dropping all traffic that conforms to
	  only that meter.

	  Clearly, it is necessary to identify what is to be done with
	  messages that	conform	to the meter, and with messages	that do
	  not. It is also necessary for	the meter to be	arbitrarily
	  extensible, as some PHBs require the successive application of
	  an arbitrary number of meters.  The approach taken in	this
	  design is to have each meter indicate	what action is to be
	  taken	for conforming traffic,	and what meter is to be	used for
	  traffic which	fails to conform. With the definition of a





	  Fred Baker	     Expiration: January 2000		[Page 6]





	  Draft		   Differentiated Services MIB	       July 1999


	  special type of meter	to which all traffic conforms, we now
	  have the necessary flexibility.

	  3.5.	Action Table

	  Considerable discussion has taken place regarding the	possible
	  actions.  Suggested actions include "no action", "mark the
	  traffic", "drop the traffic, randomly	or all of it", and
	  "shape the traffic." In this MIB, three actions are
	  contemplated:	marking	the traffic, counting the traffic that
	  passes that route, applying a	drop policy. The author	notes
	  that marking the traffic with	the same DSCP as it already has
	  no effect, and all traffic must expect to come up against some
	  drop policy.

	  Two sizes of objects are defined for some counters. These are
	  defined in accordance	with the method	found in [IFMIB]; both
	  32 and 64 bit	counters are defined, with the expectation that
	  the 32 bit counter is	simply the least significant bits of the
	  64 bit counter. For interfaces that operate at 20,000,000 (20
	  million) bits	per second or less, 32-bit byte	and packet
	  counters MUST	be used.  For interfaces that operate faster
	  than 20,000,000 bits/second, and slower than 650,000,000
	  bits/second, 32-bit packet counters MUST be used and 64-bit
	  octet	counters MUST be used.	For interfaces that operate at
	  650,000,000 bits/second or faster, 64-bit packet counters AND
	  64-bit octet counters	MUST be	used.

	  Traffic conforming to	a meter	and not	dropped	is presented to
	  a queue for further processing.

	  3.6.	Queue Table

	  In this version of the MIB, a	relatively simple FIFO queue is
	  envisaged within the Traffic Control Block. Scheduling among
	  TCBs is done by some external	scheduler. We presume some form
	  of Class Weighted Round Robin	within one or more sets	of
	  queues, each of which	enjoys preemptive priority over	lower
	  numbered priorities of queue sets. Each queue	is capable of
	  acting as a work-conserving queue (one which transmits as
	  rapidly as its weight	allows,	but guarantees to its class of
	  traffic, as a	side-effect of its weight, a minimum rate), or
	  as a non-work-conserving or "shaping"	queue. Queue sets and
	  more complex queue types - which are common and required to
	  correctly implement Differentiated Services, are modeled as
	  several of these FIFO	queues.






	  Fred Baker	     Expiration: January 2000		[Page 7]





	  Draft		   Differentiated Services MIB	       July 1999


	  Multiple meters may direct their traffic to the same queue.
	  For example, the Assured Forwarding PHB suggests that	all
	  traffic marked AF11, AF12, or	AF13 be	placed in the same queue
	  without reordering.

	  Some discussion has elapsed concerning the structure of the
	  queue	in question, and its functions.	It is expected that the
	  description of the queuing system will grow during working
	  group	discussion. This is an area where vendors differ
	  markedly in their architectures.

	  3.7.	The use	of RowPointer

	  RowPointer is	a textual convention used to identify a
	  conceptual row in an SNMP Table by pointing to one of	its
	  objects. In this MIB,	it is used in two ways:	to indicate
	  indirection, and to indicate succession.

	  When used for	indirection, as	in the Classifier table, the
	  idea is to allow other MIBs, including proprietary ones, to
	  identify new and arcane classifiers -	MAC headers, IP4 and IP6
	  headers, BGP Communities, and	all sorts of things.

	  When used for	succession, it answers the question "what
	  happens next?".  Rather than presume that the	next table must
	  be as	specified in the conceptual model and providing	its
	  index, the RowPointer	takes you to the MIB row representing
	  that thing. In the Meter Table, for example, the "FailNext"
	  RowPointer might take	you to another meter, while the
	  "SucceedNext"	RowPointer would take you to an	action.

		 system	is seen	as having a priority. Those queues that

		 appear	to be a	Weighted Round Robin manner, and preempt
		 the traffic belonging to any lower priority. For this
		 reason, it is strongly	urged that traffic placed into
		 prioritized queues be strongly	policed	to avoid traffic
		 lockout.

		 Queues	in this	table also have	a minimum and a	maximum
		 rate.	When a maximum rate is specified, the queue acts
		 as a shaper if	it has sufficient traffic and capacity
		 is available.	If it is a minimum rate, then the weight
		 in the	WRR is effectively set to this rate divided by
		 the sum of the	rates of queues	on the interface,
		 guaranteeing it at least that throughput rate.	If it is
		 a maximum rate, the queue operates as a shaper. A
		 shaper	potentially reduces the	rate of	traffic	through
		 it to the indicated rate, and minimizes variations in

	  5.  Acknowledgments

	  This MIB has been developed with active involvement from a
	  number of sources, but most notably Yoram Bernet, Steve Blake,
	  Brian	Carpenter, Kwok	Chan, Dave Durham, Jeremy Greene, Roch
	  Guerin, Scott	Hahn, Keith McCloghrie,	Kathleen Nichols, Ping
	  Pan, Andrew Smith, and Bert Wijnen.

	  6.  Security Considerations

	  It is	clear that this	MIB is potentially useful for
	  configuration, and anything that can be configured can be
	  misconfigured, with potentially disastrous effect.

	  At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond
	  those	that SNMP Security is itself intended to address. These
	  relate to primarily controlled access	to sensitive information
	  and the ability to configure a device	- or which might result
	  from operator	error, which is	beyond the scope of any	security
	  architecture.

	  There	are a number of	management objects defined in this MIB
	  that have a MAX-ACCESS clause	of read-write and/or read-
	  create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
	  in some network environments.	 The support for SET operations
	  in a non-secure environment without proper protection	can have
	  a negative effect on network operations. The use of SNMP
	  Version 3 is recommended over	prior versions,	for
	  configuration	control, as its	security model is improved.

	  There	are a number of	managed	objects	in this	MIB that may
	  contain information that may be sensitive from a business
	  perspective, in that they may	represent a customer's service
	  contract or the filters that the service provider chooses to
	  apply	to a customer's	ingress	or egress traffic. There are no
	  objects which	are sensitive in their own right, such as
	  passwords or monetary	amounts.

	  It may be important to control even GET access to these
	  objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
	  object when sending them over	the network via	SNMP.  Not all
	  versions of SNMP provide features for	such a secure
	  environment.
