Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Rapidly Deployable Radio Network (RDRN) Network Control Protocol
   (NCP).

The Network Management Framework


   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components. They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is
      wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17/RFC 1213 which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for net-
      work access to managed objects.

      The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
      experimentation and evaluation.


Objects


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [3]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

Format of Definitions


   Section 5 contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [5,6].

Overview

   This section defines some of the terminology used in the Description
   of the NCP operation.

     o   "AX.25"

         Asynchronous X.25 Protocol (See [1]).

     o   "Callsign"

         The packet radio callsign is assigned by the FCC and
         identifies the packet radio operator.

     o   "Edge Switch" (ES)

         A node which either resides within the wireless
         network or at the edge of the fixed and
         wireless network and which serves as a base station.

     o   "Global Positioning System" (GPS)

          Satellite system which provides location and time.

     o   "Remote Node" (RN)

         A host with the ability to connect via a beamforming
         antenna to an edge switch (ES).


 Rapidly Deployable Radio Network Control Protocol


   The Rapidly Deployable Radio Network (RDRN) [8] and [9] consists of
   links formed by beamforming antennas. While beamforming allows
   improved spectrum usage through spatial reuse, it poses a challenge
   to configure. Each mobile node and base station contains a GPS
   receiver and is aware of its current location. This information is
   shared among nodes and an optimal topology for beamformed links is
   determined.  The protocol which carries this information is known as
   the network control protocol (NCP) [11]. The NCP is carried over an
   omni-directional packet radio overlay network. See reference [12] for
   information about Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) and NCP.

 MIB Groups


   The definition of managed objects for the NCP is divided into eleven
   groups:

     (1)  Initialization Group
     (2)  Configuration Group
     (3)  NCP AX.25 Connection Group
     (4)  Edge Switch Group
     (5)  Remote Node Group
     (6)  GPS Specific Stats Group
     (7)  Packet Radio Specific Stats Group
     (8)  NCP Layer Specific Stats Group
     (9)  ATM Stacks Group
     (10) Beam Coverage Group
     (11) NCP Status Group



   The initialization group objects pertain to the initial startup of
   the NCP enhanced mobile node. The configuration group objects control
   timing, encryption, and other configuration information for the NCP.
   The NCP AX.25 [10] group objects maintains a mapping of packet radio
   AX.25 streams to callsigns. This is useful for determining which
   AX.25 packet radio connections are currently established.  The Edge
   Switch (ES) and Remote Node (RN) group objects manage information
   need by the beamforming algorithm to properly steer beams. The GPS,
   Packet Radio, and NCP Layer group objects manage GPS, NCP Packet
   Radio, and NCP information.

   The ATM Layer configuration objects are described in more detail in
   the next section.

   The Beam Coverage group objects provide access to information about
   the currently active beams. Finally, the NCP Status group objects
   pertain to timing information of interest to NCP. Virtual Network
   Configuration (VNC) [11] is managed by a separate MIB.

  ATM Configuration MIB Objects


   The ATM Stacks group objects manage the currently active ATM stacks
   on an ES or RN.  As the orderwire network determines the topology of
   all nodes in the wireless segment (e.g., RNs, ESs) in our architec-
   ture, and establishes link connectivity among adjacent nodes, setup
   is still required of the actual ATM circuits on which wireless ATM
   are carried on the user data overlay network. This is accomplished by
   providing standard ATM signaling capabilities to RNs and ESs and
   using Classical IP over ATM to associate ATM VCs to IP addresses. The
   Classical IP over ATM implementation provided works for PVCs and SVCs
   (using ATMARP).

   Since an ES may connect to multiple RNs (wireless connections) or ATM

   switches (wired connections), it can be thought of as a software-
   based ATM switch.  In this sense, an ES features ATM PNNI signaling
   while an RN features ATM UNI signaling. By default, an RN creates one
   wireless-ATM protocol stack and establishes an ATM VC signaling chan-
   nel on such a stack; however, the stack is initially in an inactive
   state (i.e., non-operational mode) since there is no link connectiv-
   ity to another node established yet.  Likewise, an ES creates a pre-
   defined number of wireless-ATM protocol stacks -- acting like ports
   in an ATM switch -- and establishes ATM VC signaling channels on all
   configured stacks which are also initialized as inactive. Wireless-
   ATM protocol stacks are controlled by a daemon, called the adaptation
   manager, which acts on behalf of the orderwire network. The adapta-
   tion manager daemon not only controls the stacks by setting their
   state to either active or inactive (default), but also may modify
   configuration parameters of the stacks to provide dynamic adaptation
   to link conditions.

   Two possible scenarios illustrate the interactions between the order-
   wire network and the wireless-ATM network.  In the first scenario the
   orderwire detects link connectivity between an adjacent pair of nodes
   (e.g., RN-ES or ES-ES). In this case, the orderwire network requests
   an inactive stack from the adaptation manager daemon at each end and
   associates them with a designated address. Upon establishment of link
   connectivity, a requested wireless stack has its state set to active
   and is ready to operate. Note that since the signaling channels are
   preconfigured on the stacks in question, users on the wireless estab-
   lish end-to-end connections exactly as if they were connected in a
   wired ATM network.

   The other scenario occurs when the orderwire network detects a broken
   connection, at the link level, between two connected nodes. This case
   is typical of an RN moving away from the connectivity range of an ES.
   The orderwire network thus contacts the adaptation manager daemon at
   each end to set the wireless stacks in question to inactive. Since a
   wireless stack is never destroyed, it can be reused in a future
   request from the orderwire to establish connectivity to another pair
   of nodes.

Security Considerations


   Clearly, the DES encryption key should not be accessible in the MIB,
   however, this remains in the MIB for debugging and testing purposes.
   Also, critical timing parameters are set-able from this MIB. Again
   this is useful for experimental purposes, but may not be desired for
   commercial use.
