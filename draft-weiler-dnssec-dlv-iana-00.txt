Abstract

   DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) is a mechanism for publishing
   DNSSEC trust anchors outside of the DNS delegation chain.  This
   document asks IANA to create a DLV registry containing entries for
   TLDs as well as the reverse-tree delegations maintained by IANA.

Internet-Draft                  DLV IANA                       July 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document assumes familiarity with DNSSEC Lookaside Validation
   (DLV) [I-D.weiler-dnssec-dlv] as well as the core DNSSEC
   specifications [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create a DLV registry at dlv.dnssec.arpa targeting
   the root and containing DLV records for those TLDs and reverse zones
   delegated directly by IANA that ask to have DLV records published for
   their own zones.

   IANA is instructed to use its own best practices for authenticating
   zone operators' requests to insert, modify, and delete DLV entries.

   This DLV registry MUST itself be signed with DNSSEC.

   To be clear, IANA is only being asked to publish DLV records for top
   level domains and reverse zones delegated directly from IANA, thereby
   taking advantage of the IANA's existing relationships with the these
   zone operations and established procedures for authenticating
   requests from these zone operators.


3.  Security Considerations

   General security considerations for DLV are discussed in
   [I-D.weiler-dnssec-dlv].

   A DLV registry is a signed zone, much like any other.  IANA is asked
   to use ordinary operating procedures for this signed zone, as
   described in [RFC4641].  In particular, it is suggested that IANA use
   2048-bit RSA keys for both the KSK and ZSKs in this zone and roll the
   KSK at least once per year for the first four years this registry is
   in operation.  (The ZSK will presumably be rolled somewhat more
   often.)  IANA is encouraged to generate several KSKs for this zone
   immediately and publish a hash of each of those keys, perhaps in the
   form of a DS record, at the time the registry goes into production
   service.
