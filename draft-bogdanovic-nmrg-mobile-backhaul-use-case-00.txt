1.  Introduction

   Microwave technology is one of the workhorses in MBH networks today.
   Unlicensed microwave links can be set up in days rather than the
   weeks or months it might take to implement additional wireline
   capacity for backhaul.  Even licensed links, while requiring some
   mildly time-consuming bureaucratic approval, still easily outpace the
   time-to-deployment of wireline alternatives.  Fiber may offer
   unlimited bandwidth, but the tradeoff is in time and cost savings.
   Microwave's improvements in bandwidth, capacity, and reliability in
   the past few years have made it an ideal interim broadband
   connectivity solution during the often lengthy process of deploying
   fiber.  In fact, these improvements go as far as to establish
   microwave as a legitimate permanent alternative to fiber.  Although
   its many benefits, because of other restrictions that microwave links
   have, they can't be utilized at maximum.  OSPF/MPLS networks that are
   overlayed on top of microwave transport and provide additional
   benefits of packet routing and switching to mobile backhaul.

2.  Problem Statement

   Mobile backhaul (MBH) networks utilize microwave networks to
   transport traffic back to Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN).  Base
   transceiver stations (BTS) and/or eNodeBs connect to a device that
   has multiple microwave connections to PLMN.  Not each link has the
   same throughtput and the quality of the link varies with different
   factors,like air temperature, percipitation, vegetation, etc.  Today
   those networks are overlayed with OSPF/MPLS networks and although
   OSPF provides automatic redirection of traffic in case of primary
   link failure, it reduces network throughput, as microwave link
   bandwidth slowly degrades, due to rain, snow, tower bending due to
   wind and/or temperature, vegatation growing.  During the link
   degradation period, the throughput of MBH part is going down and the
   overall service is impacted.  Being able to detect the degradation of
   the microwave link bandwidth and redirect traffic over higher
   throughput links is very beneficial to mobile network operators.

3.  Intended User and Administrator Experience

   As MBH links are lowering the bandwidth, the user experience is
   impacted, as the data hungry applications are not served with usual
   quality of service and latency is increasing, due to dropped packets.
   MBH network administrator are not getting real time picture (usually
   today they see average link performance over 15 minutes period) and
   with users being highly mobile, they can't react to the challenges in
   the network.  Administrators should be able to set intended policy on
   device, based on which device wwould start changing network

   forwarding parameters based on which the current traffic would be
   routed via links with moste throughput.  With monitoring the link
   statistics, device can change forwarding and routing parameters in
   realtime based on the intended policy pushed on the device, without
   the need to interact with centralized management system, which would
   act based on sent link performance indicators.  Such a network would
   improve end user experience, as well network administrators would be
   able to create better performing networks.

4.  Analysis of Parameters and Information Involved

   Numerous parameters are involved in monitoring MBH, from microwave
   link performance, to miscellaneous OSFP and MPLS parameters.  MNO has
   to look at KPI that will relate to those that may impact revenue
   negatively, such as unavailability and MTTR.  One thing to note here
   is that much emphasis is usually placed on availability, while most
   times not enough emphasis is placed on reliability.  In defining Key
   Performance Indicators effectively, KPIs must align with BTS
   availability information for a mobile operator.

   Microwave transmission

   o  availability

   o  capacity

   o  delay

   o  jitter

4.1.  Parameters each device can decide for itself

   All OSPF interfaces have a cost, which is a routing metric that is
   used in the link-state calculation.  Routes with lower total path
   metrics are preferred to those with higher path metrics.  OSPF
   assigns a default cost metric of 1 to reference bandwidth and default
   cost metric of 0 to the loopback interface (lo0).  No bandwidth is
   associated with the loopback interface.  So if reference bandwidth is
   set to 1Gbps, it means that all interfaces faster than 1Gbps have the
   same default cost metric of 1.  If multiple equal-cost paths exist
   between a source and destination address, OSPF routes packets along
   each path alternately, in round-robin fashion.

   Having the same default metric might not be a problem if all of the
   interfaces are running at the same speed.  In MBH, microwave units
   will connect via ethernet to ethernet ports on routers and each link
   will have the same metric.  That would not be a problem if all
   microwave links would have same performance, but links operate at

   different speeds, and it is very probable that traffic is not routed
   over the fastest interface because OSPF equally routes packets across
   the different interfaces.

   The autonomic agent agents collects operational statistics from
   ethernet ports to which microwave IDU is connected, as well from
   microwave ODU (local and remote) using SNMP.  By collecting this
   statistics, optimal MBH OSPF agent can callculate links with best
   performance and change the metric value for each link accordingly.

4.2.  Information needed from policy intent

   The section describers what information is needed to be provided by
   external entity, so that devices can operate autonomicly.  The policy
   would have to set:

   o  reference bandwidth - example 1Gbps

   o  low water mark threshold, at which point to change the metric

   o  IP address or addresses of local IDU

   o  IP address or addresses of local ODU

   o  IP address or addresses of remote IDU

   o  IP address or addresses of remote ODU

   o  which ethernet port is connect to which microwave link

   This list is not extensive and with more research it can be augmented
   with new parameters.  The experience will show what parameters are
   important.  There might be a need to put time restrictions between
   metric updates on the device or how often are statistics collected,
   as it is important not to negatively effect device forwarding
   capabilities.

5.  Interaction with other devices

   The device would interact with microwave IDU and ODU.  It would
   interact with them via SNMP or some other protocol that allows to
   collect operating statistics of the microwave link.  By collecting
   those statistics, it can compute the link perfomance.  It is also
   possible to communicate with other autonomic device in MBH and to
   exchange information, so that devices can learn the whole topology in
   segment and performance of the microwave links in possible path.

5.1.  Information needed from other devices

   In Figure 2, a small example is shown how MBH router 1 is connected
   via microwave links to router MBH 2 and MBH 3.  Microwave IDUs are
   connected via ethernet to MBH routers and each IDU has two ODUs
   connected.  Microwave links usually have two beams in a link.
   Microwave IDUs send each incoming packet from MBH router 1 to each
   ODU connected to them, essentially copying packets over each beam in
   the microwave links.  The terminating IDU C and D, on the other side,
   compare incoming packets from each ODU and drop the duplicate packets
   prior to forwarding the packet to their connected MBH routers.  This
   mechanism allows collecting good operating statistics of the links,
   so autonomic agent on MBH routers can calculate end to end
   performance of each link, like latency, throughput, jitter, delay
   etc.  This allows building performance topology on the MBH router by
   autonomic agent

5.2.  Monitoring, diagnostics and reporting

   The autonomic user agent should provide feedback data to centralized
   management system, so that new improved intent policies can be
   created.  Most of the data doesn't have to be provided in real time,
   except for cases when microwave link failure happens and causes loss

   of data.  This means that the autonomic agent didn't provide
   alternative path in time or all microwave links from the MBH router
   are down.  Historical data, like what were the network conditions
   under which the autonomic agent enforcing the intent policies are
   very valuable, as well the performance topology from each device, as
   it allows to create whole performance view of the MBH.

6.  Comparison with current solutions

   There are some vendors (NSN, Ericsson) that are trying to create self
   organizing networks, but the inteligence is always centralized, which
   prevents distribution of the network inteligence and using it for
   autonomic use cases.

7.  Security Considerations

   As this stage, author of the draft didn't look into security
   considerations of the use case.
