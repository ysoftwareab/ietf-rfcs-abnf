   1.  Abstract
     
     This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-types 
     multipart/voice-message and multipart/fax for use with the Voice 
     Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) for Unified Messaging..  It also 
     introduces the primary content type concept.  A further 
     description of usage can be found in the VPIM v3 specification 
     [VPIM3].  This document revises earlier sub-type registrations in 
     RFC 2423 [V-MSG] for [VPIM2] and RFC 1911 [VPIM1].
     
     
   2. VPIM v3 Scope
     
     The VPIM v3 specification defines a profile of the Internet Mail 
     protocols for use between unified or universal platforms.  These 
     platforms are intended to be full Internet Mail platforms with the 
     ability to handle voice and fax media as well.  Historically, 
     voice, fax and email have existed on separate systems.  Recently, 
     email profiles have been created for both voice [VPIM2] and fax 
     [IFAX] but these are restrictive to only that media and special-
     purpose computer systems they were intended for.  VPIM v3 lifts 
     these restrictions, but to facilitate efficient unified messaging 
     benefits a primary content type semantic must be provided by 
     multipart/voice-message and multipart/fax.
     
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and 
     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
     [REQ].
     
     
   3. Unified Messaging Interchange
     
     Though many systems can send and receive messages containing many 
     different media (as different content types within a 
     multipart/mixed), all the media are given an equal importance.  
     That is, a message with a voice, fax and spreadsheet attachment 
     may be sent from a system to recipients on many different systems 
     (with different capabilities).  If the message was sent to a voice 
     messaging system, and the primary content of the message was the 
     voice œ the fax and spreadsheet were merely FYI œ the message 
     would not be delivered because the other contents could not be 
     rendered.
     
     However, if the message was identified as being primarily a voice 
     message, the receiving voice-only system could detect that and 
     deliver the voice but discard the informational attachments.

     Additionally, the use of this content type will allow unified 
     messaging systems to view the message as intended (e.g., as a 
     voice message using a plug-in).  This could give the user the 
     voice message (or fax message) interface œ which would likely be 
     slightly different than the generic view.
     
     Described below are two content types intended as a wrapper to 
     indicate the semantic of primary content type.  When used they 
     MUST be the top level content of that message..
     
   3.1 multipart/voice-message
     
     The MIME sub-type multipart/voice-message is re-defined to hold an 
     audio content and any number of other content type as described in 
     [VPIM3].  Essentially, the sub-type provides a simple wrapper that 
     easily identifies the entire content as being the components of a 
     single voice message.  The sub-type is similar in semantics and 
     syntax to multipart/mixed, as defined in [MIME2].  The difference 
     introduced in this revision is that the primary content of this 
     multipart is voice (audio/*).  As such, it may be safely 
     interpreted as a multipart/mixed by systems that do not understand 
     the sub-type (only the identification as being a voice message 
     would be lost).
     
     If a receiving system downgrades an incoming message (i.e., drops 
     non-voice contents for delivery), a appropriate non-delivery 
     message MUST be sent to the originator indicating that contents 
     were deleted to deliver the primary voice content.
     
     In addition to the MIME required boundary parameter, a version 
     parameter is also REQUIRED for this sub-type.  This is to 
     distinguish this refinement of the sub-type from the previous 
     definition in [VPIM1] and [V-MSG].  The value of the version 
     parameter is "3.0" if the content conforms to the requirements of 
     [VPIM3]. The default version value (when the parameter is missing) 
     is 1, indicating the content conforms to the requirements of 
     [VPIM1].
     
     Note: [VPIM2] describes the restriction that only specific media 
     types applicable to voice messaging (audio/*, image/*, 
     message/rfc822 and application/directory), are valid ’next-levelÿ 
     contents of this sub-type (when version=2.0).

   3.2 multipart/fax
     
     The MIME sub-type multipart/fax is defined to hold a fax image as 
     described in [IFAX] and any number of other content types.  
     Essentially, the sub-type provides a simple wrapper that easily 
     identifies the entire content as being the components of a single 
     fax message.  The sub-type is similar in semantics and syntax to 
     multipart/mixed, as defined in [MIME2].  The difference is that 
     the primary content of this multipart is fax (image/tiff).  As 
     such, it may be safely interpreted as a multipart/mixed by systems 
     that do not understand the sub-type (only the identification as 
     being a fax message would be lost).
     
     If a receiving system downgrades an incoming message (i.e., drops 
     non-voice contents for delivery), a appropriate non-delivery 
     message MUST be sent to the originator indicating that contents 
     were deleted to deliver the primary voice content.
     
     
   4.  IANA Registration
     
   4.1 multipart/voice-message
     
     To: ietf-types@iana.org
     Subject: Registration of MIME media type 
              multipart/voice-message
     
          MIME media type name: multipart
     
          MIME subtype name: voice-message
     
          Required parameters: boundary, version
     
             The use of boundary is defined in [MIME2]
     
     The version parameter contains the value "3.0" if the 
     enclosed content conforms to [VPIM3]. The version parameter 
     contains the value "2.0" if the enclosed content conforms 
     to [VPIM2]. The absence of this parameter indicates 
     conformance to the previous version defined in RFC 1911 
     [VPIM1].
     
          Optional parameters: none
     
          Encoding considerations: 7bit, 8bit or Binary

          Security considerations: 
     
     This definition identifies the content as being a voice 
     message.  In some environments (though likely not the 
     majority), the loss of the anonymity of the content may be 
     a security issue.
     
          Interoperability considerations: 
     
     Systems developed to conform with [VPIM1] and [VPIM2] may 
     not conform to this registration.  Specifically, there may 
     be unrenderable content types received, in this case the 
     recipient system should NDN the message.  Also the VPIM v1 
     positional identification will likely be lost.

     a security issue.
     
          Interoperability considerations: 
     
     Systems developed strictly to conform with [IFAX] may not 
     be able to receive multipart/fax-message (though this 
     should be treate as multipart/mixed).  In this case, 
     interoperability would fail.
