<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs that handle
                TCP that would allow many applications, such as peer-to-peer
                applications and on-line games, to work consistently.
                Developing NATs that meet this set of requirements will greatly
                increase the likelihood that these applications will function
                properly.

Applicability Statement</h3>

<p>This document is adjunct to <a class='info' href='#BEHAVE-UDP'>[BEHAVE&#8209;UDP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, which
                defines many terms relating to NATs, lays out general
                requirements for all NATs, and sets requirements for NATs that
                handle IP and unicast UDP traffic. The purpose of this document
                is to set requirements for NATs that handle TCP traffic.
</p>
<p>The requirements of this specification apply to Traditional NATs
                as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2663'>[RFC2663]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Srisuresh, P. and M. Holdrege, &ldquo;IP Network Address Translator (NAT) Terminology and Considerations,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document only covers the TCP aspects of NAT traversal.
                Middle-box behavior that is not necessary for network address
                translation of TCP is out-of-scope. Firewalls, and packet
                inspection above the TCP layer are out-of-scope except for
                Application Level Gateways (ALG) behavior that may interfere
                with NAT traversal. Application and OS aspects of TCP NAT
                traversal are out-of-scope. Signaling based approaches to NAT
                traversal such as MIDCOM and UPnP that directly control the NAT
                are out-of-scope. Finally, TCP connections intended for the NAT
                (e.g. an HTTP or SSH management interface) and TCP connections
                initiated by the NAT (e.g. reliable syslog client) are
                out-of-scope.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Network Address Translators (NATs) hinder connectivity in
                applications where sessions may be initiated to internal hosts.
                Readers may refer to <a class='info' href='#RFC3022'>[RFC3022]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Srisuresh, P. and K. Egevang, &ldquo;Traditional IP Network Address Translator (Traditional NAT),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> for detailed
                information on traditional NATs.  <a class='info' href='#BEHAVE-UDP'>[BEHAVE&#8209;UDP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
                lays out the terminology and requirements for NATs in the
                context of IP and UDP. This document supplements these by
                setting requirements for NATs that handle TCP traffic. All
                definitions and requirements in <a class='info' href='#BEHAVE-UDP'>[BEHAVE&#8209;UDP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> are
                inherited here.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#RFC4614'>[RFC4614]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Duke, M., Braden, R., Eddy, W., and E. Blanton, &ldquo;A Roadmap for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Specification Documents,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> chronicles the evolution of TCP
                from the original definition <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> to
                present day implementations. While much has changed in TCP with
                regards to congestion control and flow control, security, and
                support for high-bandwidth networks, the process of initiating
                a connection (i.e. the 3-way handshake or simultaneous-open)
                has changed little. It is the process of connection initiation
                that NATs affect the most. Experimental approaches such as
                T/TCP <a class='info' href='#RFC1644'>[RFC1644]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., &ldquo;T/TCP -- TCP Extensions for Transactions Functional Specification,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a> have proposed alternate
                connection initiation approaches, but, have been found to be
                complex and susceptible to denial-of-service attacks. Modern
                operating systems and NATs consequently primarily support the
                3-way handshake and simultaneous-open modes of connection
                initiation as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Recently, many techniques have been devised to make peer-to-peer
                TCP applications work across NATs. <a class='info' href='#STUNT'>[STUNT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Guha, S. and P. Francis, &ldquo;NUTSS: A SIP based approach to UDP and TCP connectivity,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>,
                <a class='info' href='#NATBLASTER'>[NATBLASTER]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Biggadike, A., Ferullo, D., Wilson, G., and A. Perrig, &ldquo;NATBLASTER: Establishing TCP connections between hosts behind NATs,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#P2PNAT'>[P2PNAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ford, B., Srisuresh, P., and D. Kegel, &ldquo;Peer-to-peer communication across network address translators,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>
                describe Unilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF) mechanisms
                that allow peer-to-peer applications to establish TCP through
                NATs. These approaches require only endpoint applications to be
                modified and work with standards compliant OS stacks. The
                approaches, however, depend on specific NAT behavior that is
                usually, but not always, supported by NATs (see <a class='info' href='#TCPTRAV'>[TCPTRAV]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Guha, S. and P. Francis, &ldquo;Characterization and Measurement of TCP Traversal through NATs and Firewalls,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#P2PNAT'>[P2PNAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ford, B., Srisuresh, P., and D. Kegel, &ldquo;Peer-to-peer communication across network address translators,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> for
                details). Consequently a complete TCP NAT traversal solution is
                sometimes forced to rely on public TCP relays to traverse NATs
                that do not cooperate. This document defines requirements that
                ensure that TCP NAT traversal approaches are not forced to use
                data relays.

Address and Port Mapping Behavior</h3>

<p>A NAT uses a mapping to translate packets for each TCP
                    connection. A mapping is dynamically allocated for
                    connections initiated from the internal side, and
                    potentially reused for certain subsequent connections. NAT
                    behavior regarding when a mapping can be reused differs for
                    different NATs as described in <a class='info' href='#BEHAVE-UDP'>[BEHAVE&#8209;UDP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Consider an internal IP address and TCP port (X:x) that
                    initiates a TCP connection to an external (Y1:y1) tuple.
                    Let the mapping allocated by the NAT for this connection be
                    (X1':x1'). Shortly thereafter, the endpoint initiates a
                    connection from the same (X:x) to an external address
                    (Y2:y2) and gets the mapping (X2':x2') on the NAT. As per
                    <a class='info' href='#BEHAVE-UDP'>[BEHAVE&#8209;UDP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, if (X1':x1') equals (X2':x2')
                    for all values of (Y2:y2) then the NAT is defined to have
                    "Endpoint Independent Mapping" behavior. If (X1':x1')
                    equals (X2':x2') only when Y2 equals Y1 then the NAT is
                    defined to have "Address Dependent Mapping" behavior. If
                    (X1':x1') equals (X2':x2') only when (Y2:y2) equals
                    (Y1:y1), possible only for consecutive connections to the
                    same external address shortly after the first is terminated
                    and if the NAT retains state for connections in TIME_WAIT
                    state, then the NAT is defined to have "Address and Port
                    Dependent Mapping" behavior. This document introduces one
                    additional behavior where (X1':x1') never equals (X2':x2'),
                    that is, for each connection a new mapping is allocated; in
                    such a case, the NAT is defined to have "Connection
                    Dependent Mapping" behavior.

Internally Initiated Connections</h3>

<p>An internal endpoint initiates a TCP connection through a
                    NAT by sending a SYN packet. The NAT allocates (or reuses)
                    a mapping for the connection, as described in the previous
                    section. The mapping defines the external IP address and
                    port used for translation of all packets for that
                    connection. In particular, for client-server applications
                    where an internal client initiates the connection to an
                    external server, the mapping is used to translate the
                    outbound SYN, the resulting inbound SYN-ACK response, the
                    subsequent outbound ACK, and other packets for the
                    connection. This method of connection initiation
                    corresponds to the 3-way handshake (defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>) and is supported by all NATs.
</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer applications use an alternate method of
                    connection initiation termed simultaneous-open (Fig. 8,
                    <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>) to traverse NATs. In the
                    Simultaneous-Open mode of operation, both peers send SYN
                    packets for the same TCP connection. The SYN packets cross
                    in the network. Upon receiving the other end's SYN packet
                    each end responds with a SYN-ACK packet, which also cross in
                    the network. The connection is considered established once
                    the SYN-ACKs are received. From the perspective of the NAT,
                    the internal host's SYN packet is met by an inbound SYN
                    packet for the same connection (as opposed to a SYN-ACK
                    packet during a 3-way handshake). Subsequent to this
                    exchange, both an outbound and an inbound SYN-ACK are seen
                    for the connection. Some NATs erroneously block the inbound
                    SYN for the connection in progress. Some NATs block or
                    incorrectly translate the outbound SYN-ACK. Such behavior
                    breaks TCP simultaneous-open and prevents peer-to-peer
                    applications from functioning correctly behind a NAT.
</p>
<p>In order to provide network address translation service for
                    TCP, it is necessary for a NAT to correctly receive,
                    translate, and forward all packets for a connection that
                    conform to valid transitions of the TCP State-Machine (Fig.
                    6, <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>).

Externally Initiated Connections</h3>

<p>The NAT allocates a mapping for the first connection
                    initiated by an internal endpoint to an external endpoint.
                    In some scenarios, the NAT's policy may allow this mapping
                    to be reused for connections initiated from the external
                    side to the internal endpoint. Consider as before an
                    internal IP address and port (X:x) that is assigned (or
                    reuses) a mapping (X1':x1') when it initiates a connection
                    to an external (Y1:y1). An external endpoint (Y2:y2)
                    attempts to initiate a connection with the internal
                    endpoint by sending a SYN to (X1':x1'). A NAT can choose to
                    either allow the connection to be established, or to
                    disallow the connection. If the NAT chooses to allow the
                    connection, it translates the inbound SYN and routes it to
                    (X:x) as per the existing mapping. It also translates the
                    SYN-ACK generated by (X:x) in response and routes it to
                    (Y2:y2) and so on. Alternately, the NAT can disallow the
                    connection by filtering the inbound SYN. 
</p>
<p>A NAT may allow an existing mapping to be reused by an
                    externally initiated connection if its security policy
                    permits. Several different policies are possible as
                    described in <a class='info' href='#BEHAVE-UDP'>[BEHAVE&#8209;UDP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. If a NAT allows
                    the connection initiation from all (Y2:y2) then it is
                    defined to have "Endpoint Independent Filtering" behavior.
                    If the NAT allows connection initiations only when Y2
                    equals Y1 then the NAT is defined to have "Address
                    Dependent Filtering" behavior. If the NAT allows connection
                    initiations only when (Y2:y2) equals (Y1:y1), then the NAT
                    is defined to have "Address and Port Dependent Filtering"
                    behavior (possible only shortly after the first connection
                    has been terminated but the mapping is still active). One
                    additional filtering behavior defined in this document is
                    when the NAT does not allow any connection initiations from
                    the external side; in such cases, the NAT is defined to
                    have "Connection Dependent Filtering" behavior. The
                    difference between "Address and Port Dependent Filtering"
                    and "Connection Dependent Filtering" behavior is that the
                    former permits an inbound SYN during the TIME_WAIT state of
                    the first connection to initiate a new connection while the
                    latter does not.

<p>If the inbound SYN packet is filtered, either because a
                    corresponding mapping does not exist or because of the
                    NAT's filtering behavior, a NAT has two basic choices: to
                    ignore the packet silently, or to signal an error to the
                    sender. Signaling an error through ICMP messages allows the
                    sender to quickly detect that the SYN did not reach the
                    intended destination. Silently dropping the packet, on the
                    other hand, allows applications to perform
                    Simultaneous-Open more reliably.
</p>
<p>Silently dropping the SYN aids Simultaneous-Open as follows.
                    Consider that the application is attempting a
                    Simultaneous-Open and the outbound SYN from the internal
                    endpoint has not yet crossed the NAT (due to network
                    congestion or clock skew between the two endpoints); this
                    outbound SYN would otherwise have created the necessary
                    mapping at the NAT to allow translation of the inbound SYN.
                    Since the outbound SYN did not reach the NAT in time, the
                    inbound SYN cannot be processed. If a NAT responds to the
                    premature inbound SYN with an error message that forces the
                    external endpoint to abandon the connection attempt, it
                    hinders applications performing a TCP simultaneous-open. If
                    instead the NAT silently ignores the inbound SYN, the
                    external endpoint retransmits the SYN after a TCP timeout.
                    In the meantime, the NAT creates the mapping in response to
                    the (delayed) outbound SYN such that the retransmitted
                    inbound SYN can be routed and simultaneous-open can
                    succeed. The down-side to this behavior is that in the
                    event the inbound SYN is erroneous, the remote side does
                    not learn of the error until after several TCP timeouts.
                
</p>
<p>NAT support for simultaneous-open as well as quickly
                    signaling errors are both important for applications.
                    Unfortunately, there is no way for a NAT to signal an error
                    without forcing the endpoint to abort a potential
                    simultaneous-open: TCP RST and ICMP Port Unreachable
                    packets require the endpoint to abort the attempt while
                    ICMP Host and Network Unreachable errors may adversely
                    affect other connections to the same host or network <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In addition, when an unsolicited SYN is received by the NAT,
                    the NAT may not know whether the application is attempting a
                    simultaneous-open (and that it should therefore silently
                    drop the SYN) or whether the SYN is in error (and that it
                    should notify the sender).

NAT Session Refresh</h3>

<p>A NAT maintains state associated with in-progress and
                established connections. Because of this, a NAT is susceptible
                to a resource-exhaustion attack whereby an attacker (or virus)
                on the internal side attempts to cause the NAT to create more
                state than it has resources for. To prevent such an attack, a
                NAT needs to abandon sessions in order to free the state
                resources.
</p>
<p>A common method that is applicable only to TCP is to
                preferentially abandon sessions for crashed endpoints, followed
                by closed TCP connections and partially-open connections. A NAT
                can check if an endpoint for a session has crashed by sending a
                TCP keep-alive packet and receiving a TCP RST packet in
                response. If the NAT cannot determine whether the endpoint is
                active, it should not abandon the session until the TCP
                connection has been idle for some time. Note that an
                established TCP connection can stay idle (but live)
                indefinitely; hence there is no fixed value for an idle-timeout
                that accommodates all applications. However, a large
                idle-timeout motivated by recommendations in <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> can reduce the chances of abandoning a
                live session.
</p>
<p>A TCP connection passes through three phases: partially-open,
                established, and closing. During the partially-open phase,
                endpoints synchronize initial sequence numbers. The phase is
                initiated by the first SYN for the connection and extends until
                both endpoints have sent a packet with the ACK flag set (TCP
                states: SYN_SENT and SYN_RCVD). ACKs in both directions mark
                the beginning of the established phase where application data
                can be exchanged indefinitely (TCP states: ESTABLISHED,
                FIN_WAIT_1, FIN_WAIT_2, and CLOSE_WAIT). The closing phase
                begins when both endpoint have terminated their half of the
                connection by sending a FIN packet. Once FIN packets are seen
                in both directions, application data can no longer be exchanged
                but the stacks still need to ensure that the FIN packets are
                received (TCP states: CLOSING and LAST_ACK).
</p>
<p>TCP connections can stay in established phase indefinitely
                without exchanging any packets. Some end-hosts can be
                configured to send keep-alive packets on such idle connections;
                by default, such keep-alive packets are sent every 2 hours if
                enabled <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a>. Consequently, a NAT that
                waits for slightly over 2 hours can detect idle connections with
                keep-alive packets being sent at the default rate. TCP
                connections in the partially-open or closing phases, on the
                other hand, can stay idle for at most 4 minutes while waiting
                for in-flight packets to be delivered <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a>.
            
</p>
<p>The "established connection idle-timeout" for a NAT is defined
                as the minimum time a TCP connection in the established phase
                must remain idle before the NAT considers the associated
                session a candidate for removal. The "transitory connection
                idle-timeout" for a NAT is defined as the minimum time a TCP
                connection in the partially-open or closing phases must remain
                idle before the NAT considers the associated session a
                candidate for removal. TCP connections in the TIME_WAIT state
                are not affected by the "transitory connection

                        state for a live connection. While some NATs may choose
                        to abandon sessions reactively in response to new
                        connection initiations (allowing idle connections to

<p>NAT behavior for handling RST packets, or connections in
                TIME_WAIT state is left unspecified. A NAT MAY hold state for a
                connection in TIME_WAIT state to accommodate retransmissions of
                the last ACK. However, since the TIME_WAIT state is commonly
                encountered by internal endpoints properly closing the TCP
                connection, holding state for a closed connection may limit the
                throughput of connections through a NAT with limited resources.
                <a class='info' href='#RFC1337'>[RFC1337]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., &ldquo;TIME-WAIT Assassination Hazards in TCP,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1992.</span><span>)</span></a> describes hazards associated

</p>
<p>The handling of non-SYN packets for connections for which there
                is no active mapping is left unspecified. Such packets may be
                received if the NAT silently abandons a live connection, or
                abandons a connection in TIME_WAIT state before the 4 minute
                TIME_WAIT period expires. The decision to either silently drop
                such packets or to respond with a TCP RST packet is left up to
                the implementation.
</p>
<p>NAT behavior for notifying endpoints when abandoning live
                connections is left unspecified. When a NAT abandons a live
                connection, for example due to a timeout expiring, the NAT MAY
                either send TCP RST packets to the endpoints or MAY silently
                abandon the connection. Sending a RST notification allows
                endpoint applications to recover more quickly, however,
                notifying the endpoints may not always be possible if, for
                example, session state it lost due to a power failure.

                    "External source IP address and port" for hairpinning.
                    Hairpinning is necessary to allow two internal endpoints
                    (known to each other only by their external mapped
                    addresses) to communicate with each other. "External source

Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Connection dependent
                        filtering behavior is most secure from a firewall
                        perspective, but severely restricts connection
                        initiations through a NAT. Endpoint independent
                        filtering behavior, which is most transparent to
                        applications, requires an attacker to guess the IP
                        address and port of an active mapping in order to get
                        his packet to an internal host. Address dependent
                        filtering, on the other hand, is less transparent than
                        endpoint independent filtering but more transparent
                        than connection dependent filtering; it is more secure
                        than endpoint independent filtering as it requires an
                        attacker to additionally guess the address of the
                        external endpoint for a NAT session associated with the
                        mapping and be able to receive packets addressed to the
                        same. While this protects against most attackers on the
                        Internet, it does not necessarily protect against
                        attacks that originate from behind a remote NAT with a
                        single IP address that is also translating a legitimate

                        seconds. Doing so may reveal the presence of a NAT to
                        an external attacker. Silently dropping the SYN makes
                        it harder to diagnose network problems and forces

                        weigh the effects of not sending an ICMP error or

<p>NAT implementations that modify TCP sequence numbers (e.g., for
                privacy reasons or for ALG support) must ensure that TCP

                properly handled.

<p>NAT implementations that modify local state based on TCP flags
                in packets must ensure that out-of-window TCP packets are
                properly handled. <a class='info' href='#RFC4953'>[RFC4953]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Touch, J., &ldquo;Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> summarizes and
