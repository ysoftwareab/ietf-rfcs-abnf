       Use of KCipher-2 with Poly1305 in Transport Layer Security
                     draft-kiyomoto-kcipher2-tls-02

Abstract

   This document describes the use of the KCipher-2 stream cipher with
   Poly1305 in Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols version 1.2 and
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocols.  KCipher-2 is a
   stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization vector,
   which provides fast, efficient encryption and decryption.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the KCipher-2 [RFC7008] in the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 [RFC5246] protocol, as
   well as in the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) version 1.2
   [RFC6347], or any later versions.

   Cryptographic operations used in TLS can be categorized in five ways:
   digital signing, stream cipher encryption, block cipher encryption,
   authenticated encryption with additional data encryption, and public
   key encryption [RFC5246].  This document defines the cipher suites to
   use KCipher-2 for stream cipher encryption in TLS.  KCipher-2 is a
   fast, secure stream cipher algorithm as well as ChaCha20 [ChaCha20].

1.1.  KCipher2

   KCipher-2 is a stream cipher algorithm with a 128-bit key and a
   128-bit initialization vector (IV).  The algorithm and other
   properties are described in [SECRYPT].  KCipher-2 has been evaluated
   by the cryptographic technique evaluation project for the Japanese
   e-Government [CRYPTREC].  KCipher-2 also has been submitted to
   another international standardization body [ISO18033].

1.2.  Poly1305 Authenticator

   Poly1305 [POLY1305] is a Wegman-Carter, one-time authenticator
   designed by D.  J.  Bernstein.  In details, Poly1305 is described in
   Section 2.5 and 2.6 of [RFC7539] .

1.3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Cipher Suites Values

   The following are proposed identifiers and values for the cipher
   suites of TLS.

    CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_POLY1305   = { TBD, TBD };
    CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_POLY1305 = { TBD, TBD };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_POLY1305     = { TBD, TBD };

3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The DHE_RSA, ECDHE_RSA, and ECDHE_ECDSA key exchanges are performed
   as defined in [RFC5246] and [RFC4496].

3.2.  Cipher

   The KCIPHER2_128 cipher suites use KCipher-2 with a 128-bit key and a
   128-bit initialization vector.

3.3.  Pseudorandom Function

   For the cipher suites in this document, [RFC2104] based on SHA-256 is
   used for TLS PseudoRandom Function (PRF) [RFC5246] with SHA-256 is
   used as the PRF.

3.4.  AEAD Construction

   KCIPHER2_128_POLY1305 is an authenticated encryption with additional
   data algorithm.  The KCipher-2 and Poly1305 [POLY1305]primitives are
   combined into an AEAD.

4.  Security Considerations

   As of the time this document was written, we are not aware of any
   attack on KCipher-2.  No security vulnerabilities have been
   identified in the security evaluations by the KCipher-2 developers
   and other independent institutions [SECRYPT], [CRYPTREC10], and
   [KDDI].

   Poly1305 is designed to ensure that forged messages are rejected with
   a probability of 1-(n/2^102) for a 16*n byte message, even after
   sending 2^64 legitimate messages.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the following numbers in the TLS Cipher
   Suite Registry:

    CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_POLY1305   = { TBD, TBD };
    CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_POLY1305 = { TBD, TBD };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_POLY1305     = { TBD, TBD };
