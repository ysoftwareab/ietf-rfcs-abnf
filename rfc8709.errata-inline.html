1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a secure remote-login protocol.  It
   provides for an extensible variety of public key algorithms for
   identifying servers and users to one another.  Ed25519 [RFC8032] is a
   digital signature system.  OpenSSH 6.5 [OpenSSH-6.5] introduced
   support for using Ed25519 for server and user authentication and was
   then followed by other SSH implementations.

   This document describes the method implemented by OpenSSH and others
   and formalizes the use of the name &quot;ssh-ed25519&quot;.  Additionally, this
   document describes the use of Ed448 and formalizes the use of the
   name &quot;ssh-ed448&quot;.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The descriptions of key and signature formats use the notation
   introduced in [RFC4251], Section 3 and the string data type from
   [RFC4251], Section 5.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Public Key Algorithm

   This document describes a public key algorithm for use with SSH, as
   per [RFC4253], Section 6.6.  The name of the algorithm is &quot;ssh-
   ed25519&quot;.  This algorithm only supports signing and not encryption.

   Additionally, this document describes another public key algorithm.
   The name of the algorithm is &quot;ssh-ed448&quot;.  This algorithm only
   supports signing and not encryption.

   Standard implementations of SSH SHOULD implement these signature
   algorithms.

4.  Public Key Format

   The &quot;ssh-ed25519&quot; key format has the following encoding:

   string  &quot;ssh-ed25519&quot;

   string  key

   Here, &#x27;key&#x27; is the 32-octet public key described in [RFC8032],
   Section 5.1.5.

   The &quot;ssh-ed448&quot; key format has the following encoding:

   string  &quot;ssh-ed448&quot;

   string  key

   Here, &#x27;key&#x27; is the 57-octet public key described in [RFC8032],
   Section 5.2.5.

5.  Signature Algorithm

   Signatures are generated according to the procedure in Sections 5.1.6
   and 5.2.6 of [RFC8032].

<span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-6164'>6.  Signature Format <button id="btn_6164" target="expand_6164" onclick='hideFunction("expand_6164")'>Expand</button>

   The &quot;ssh-ed25519&quot; signature format has the following encoding:

   string  &quot;ssh-ed25519&quot;

   string  signature

   Here, &#x27;signature&#x27; is the 64-octet signature produced in accordance
   with [RFC8032], Section 5.1.6.

   The &quot;ssh-ed448&quot; signature format has the following encoding:

   string  &quot;ssh-ed448&quot;

   string  signature

   Here, &#x27;signature&#x27; is the 114-octet signature produced in accordance
   with [RFC8032], Section 5.2.6.</span id__locate=6164>

   string  &quot;ssh-ed448&quot;

   string  signature

   Here, &#x27;signature&#x27; is the 114-octet signature produced in accordance
   with [RFC8032], Section 5.2.6.

6.  Signature Format

   The &quot;ssh-ed25519&quot; signature format has the following encoding:

   string  &quot;ssh-ed25519&quot;

   string  signature

   Here, &#x27;signature&#x27; is the 64-octet signature produced in accordance
   with [RFC8032], Section 5.1.6.

   The &quot;ssh-ed448&quot; signature format has the following encoding:

   string  &quot;ssh-ed448&quot;

   string  signature

   Here, &#x27;signature&#x27; is the 114-octet signature produced in accordance

7.  Verification Algorithm

   Ed25519 signatures are verified according to the procedure in
   [RFC8032], Section 5.1.7.

   Ed448 signatures are verified according to the procedure in
   [RFC8032], Section 5.2.7.

8.  SSHFP DNS Resource Records

   Usage and generation of the SSHFP DNS resource record is described in
   [RFC4255].  The generation of SSHFP resource records for &quot;ssh-
   ed25519&quot; keys is described in [RFC7479].  This section illustrates
   the generation of SSHFP resource records for &quot;ssh-ed448&quot; keys, and
   this document also specifies the corresponding Ed448 code point to
   &quot;SSHFP RR Types for public key algorithms&quot; in the &quot;DNS SSHFP Resource
   Record Parameters&quot; IANA registry [IANA-SSHFP].

   The generation of SSHFP resource records for &quot;ssh-ed448&quot; keys is
   described as follows.

   The encoding of Ed448 public keys is described in [ED448].  In brief,
   an Ed448 public key is a 57-octet value representing a 455-bit
   y-coordinate of an elliptic curve point, and a sign bit indicating
   the corresponding x-coordinate.

   The SSHFP Resource Record for the Ed448 public key with SHA-256
   fingerprint would, for example, be:

   example.com. IN SSHFP 6 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723
                               34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924
                               01 )

   The &#x27;2&#x27; here indicates SHA-256 [RFC6594].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document augments the Public Key Algorithm Names in [RFC4250],
   Section 4.11.3.

   IANA has added the following entry to &quot;Public Key Algorithm Names&quot; in
   the &quot;Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters&quot; registry [IANA-SSH]:

                 +---------------------------+-----------+
                 | Public Key Algorithm Name | Reference |
                 +===========================+===========+
                 | ssh-ed25519               | RFC 8709  |
                 +---------------------------+-----------+
                 | ssh-ed448                 | RFC 8709  |
                 +---------------------------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

   IANA has added the following entry to &quot;SSHFP RR Types for public key
   algorithms&quot; in the &quot;DNS SSHFP Resource Record Parameters&quot; registry
   [IANA-SSHFP]:

                    +-------+-------------+-----------+
                    | Value | Description | Reference |
                    +=======+=============+===========+
                    | 6     | Ed448       | RFC 8709  |
                    +-------+-------------+-----------+

                                  Table 2

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC4251], Section 9 apply to all SSH
   implementations, including those using Ed25519 and Ed448.

   The security considerations in [RFC8032], Section 8 and [RFC7479],
   Section 3 apply to all uses of Ed25519 and Ed448, including those in
   SSH.
