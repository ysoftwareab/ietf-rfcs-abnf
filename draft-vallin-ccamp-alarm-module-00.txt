Abstract

   This document defines a YANG module for alarm management.  It
   includes functions for alarm list management, alarm shelving and
   notifications to inform management systems.  There are also RPCs to
   manage the operator state of an alarm and administrative alarm
   procedures.  The module carefully maps to relevant alarm standards.

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module               October 2017


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] module for alarm management.
   The purpose is to define a standardised alarm interface for network
   devices that can be easily integrated into management applications.
   The model is also applicable as a northbound alarm interface in the
   management applications.

   Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
   Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the network
   services or necessarily point to the root cause.  However, being able
   to feed alarms to the network management system in a standardised
   format is a starting point for performing higher level network
   assurance tasks.

   The telecommunication domain has standardised an alarm interface in
   ITU-T X.733 [X.733].  This continued in mobile networks within the
   3GPP organisation [ALARMIRP].  Although SNMP is the dominant
   mechanism for monitoring devices, IETF did not early on standardise
   an alarm MIB.  Instead, management systems interpreted the enterprise
   specific traps per MIB and device to build an alarm list.  When
   finally The Alarm MIB [RFC3877] was published, it had to address the
   existence of enterprise traps and map these into alarms.  This
   requirement led to a MIB that is not easy to use.

   This document defines a standardised YANG module for alarm
   management.  The design of the module is based on experience from
   using and implementing the above mentioned alarm standards.

2.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950]:

   o  action

   o  client

   o  data tree

   o  RPC

   o  server

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module               October 2017


   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  Alarm (the general concept): An alarm signifies an undesirable
      state in a resource that requires corrective action.

   o  Alarm Instance: The alarm state for a specific resource and alarm
      type.  For example (GigabitEthernet0/15, link-alarm).  An entry in
      the alarm list.

   o  Alarm Inventory: A list of all possible alarm types on a system.

   o  Alarm Shelving: Blocking alarms according to specific criteria.

   o  Alarm Type: An alarm type identifies a possible unique alarm state
      for a resource.  Alarm types are names to identify the state like
      'link-alarm', 'jitter-violation', 'high-disk-utilization'.

   o  Management System: The alarm management application that consumes
      the alarms, i.e., acts as a client.

   o  Resource: A fine-grained identification of the alarming resource,
      for example: an interface, a process.

   o  System: The system that implements this YANG alarm module, i.e.,
      acts as a server.  This corresponds to a network device or a
      management application that provides a north-bound alarm
      interface.

3.  Objectives

   The objectives for the design of the Alarm Module are:

   o  Simple to use.  If a system supports this module, it shall be
      straight-forward to integrate this into a YANG based alarm
      manager.

   o  View alarms as states on resources and not as discrete
      notifications.

   o  Clear definition of "alarm" in order to exclude general events
      that should not be forwarded as alarm notifications.

   o  Clear and precise identification of alarm types and alarm
      instances.

   o  A management system should be able to pull all available alarm
      types from a system, i.e., read the alarm inventory from a system.

      This makes it possible to prepare alarm operators with
      corresponding alarm instructions.

   o  Address alarm usability requirements.  While IETF has not really
      addressed alarm management, telecom standards has addressed it
      purely from a protocol perspective.  The process industry has
      published several relevant standards addressing requirements for a
      useful alarm interface; [EEMUA], [ISA182].  This alarm module
      defines usability requirements as well as a YANG data model.

   o  Mapping to X.733, which is a requirement for many alarm systems.
      Still, keep some of the X.733 concepts out of the core model in
      order to make the model small and easy to understand.

4.  Background and Usability Requirements

   Common alarm problems and the cause of the problems are summarised in
   Table 1.  This summary is adopted to networking based on the ISA
   [ISA182] and EEMUA [EEMUA] standards.

   Vendors SHOULD rationalise all alarms according to above.  Another
   crucial requirement is acceptable alarm rates.  Vendors SHOULD make
   sure that they do not exceed the recommendations from EEMUA below:

                  Table 4: Acceptable Alarm Rates, Burst

   The numbers in Table 3 and Table 4 are the sum of all alarms for a
   network being managed from one alarm console.  So every individual
   system or NMS contributes to these numbers.

   Vendors SHOULD make sure that the following rules are used in
   designing the alarm interface:

   1.  Rationalize the alarms in the system to ensure that every alarm
       is necessary, has a purpose, and follows the cardinal rule - that
       it requires an operator response.  Adheres to the rules of
       Table 2

   2.  Audit the quality of the alarms.  Talk with the operators about
       how well the alarm information support them.  Do they know what
       to do in the event of an alarm?  Are they able to quickly
       diagnose the problem and determine the corrective action?  Does
       the alarm text adhere to the requirements in Table 2?

   3.  Analyze and benchmark the performance of the system and compare
       it to the recommended metrics in Table 3 and Table 4.  Start by
       identifying nuisance alarms, standing alarms at normal state and
       startup.

5.  Alarm Concepts

   This section defines the fundamental concepts behind the data model.
   This section is rooted in the works of Vallin et. al [ALARMSEM].

5.1.  What is an Alarm?

   There are two misconceptions regarding alarms and alarm interfaces
   that are important to sort out.  The first problem is that alarms are
   mixed with events in general.  Alarms MUST correspond to an
   undesirable state that needs corrective action.  Many implementations
   of alarm interfaces do not adhere to this principle and just send
   events in general.  In order to qualify as an alarm, there must exist
   a corrective action.  If that is not true, it is an event that can go
   into logs.

   The other misconception is that the term alarm refers to the
   notification itself.  Rather, an alarm is a state of a resource in
   the system.  The alarm notifications report state changes of the
   alarm, such as alarm raise and alarm clear.

   Based upon the above, we will use the following alarm definition:

      An alarm signifies an undesirable state in a resource that
      requires corrective action.

   "One of the most important principles of alarm management is that an
   alarm requires an action.  This means that if the operator does not
   need to respond to an alarm (because unacceptable consequences do not
   occur), then it is not an alarm.  Following this cardinal rule will
   help eliminate many potential alarm management issues."  [ISA182]

5.2.  What is an Alarm Type?

   One of the fundamental requirements stated in the previous section is
   that every alarm must have a corresponding corrective action.  This
   means that every vendor should be able to prepare a list of available
   alarms and their corrective actions.  We use the term 'alarm type' to
   refer to every possible alarm that could be active in the system.

   Alarm types are also fundamental in order to provide a state-based
   alarm list.  The alarm list correlates alarm state changes for the
   same alarm type and the same resource into one alarm.

   Different alarm interfaces use different mechanisms to define alarm
   types, ranging from simple error numbers to more advanced mechanisms
   like the X.733 triplet of event type, probable cause and specific
   problem.

   This document defines an alarm type with an alarm type id and an
   alarm type qualifier.

   The alarm type id is modeled as a YANG identity.  With YANG
   identities, new alarm types can be defined in a distributed fashion.
   YANG identities are hierarchical, which means that an hierarchy of
   alarm types can be defined.

   The primary goal for the alarm module has been to provide a simple
   but extensible mechanism.  YANG identities is a good mechanism for
   enumerated values that are easy to extend.

   This means that every possible alarm type that can appear in a system
   exists as a well defined hierarchical identity along with a
   description.  Tools can provide a list of possible alarms by parsing
   the YANG identities rather than reading user guides.

   Standards and vendors should define their own alarm type identities
   based on this definition.

   The use of YANG identities means that all possible alarms are
   identified at design time.  This explicit declaration of alarm types
   makes it easier to allow for alarm qualification reviews and
   preparation of alarm actions and documentation.

   There are occasions where the alarm types are not known at design
   time.  For example, a system with digital inputs that allows users to
   connects detectors (e.g., smoke detector) to the inputs.  In this
   case it is a configuration action that says that certain connectors
   are fire alarms for example.  The drawback of this is that there is a
   big risk that alarm operators will receive alarm types as a surprise,
   they do not know how to resolve the problem since a defined alarm
   procedure does not necessarily exist.

   In order to allow for dynamic addition of alarm types the alarm
   module also allows for further qualification of the identity based
   alarm type using a string.

   A common misunderstanding is that individual alarm notifications are
   alarm types.  This is not correct; e.g., "link-up" and "link-down"
   are two notifications reporting different states for the same alarm
   type, "link-alarm".

   A vendor or standard can then define their own alarm-type hierarchy.
   The example below shows a hierarchy based on X.733 event types:

     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity vendor-alarms {
       base al:alarm-type;
     }
     identity communications-alarm {
       base vendor-alarms;
     }
     identity link-alarm {
       base communications-alarm;
     }

   Alarm types can be abstract.  An abstract alarm type is used as a
   base for defining hierarchical alarm types.  Concrete alarm types are
   used for alarm states and appear in the alarm inventory.  There are
   two kinds of concrete alarm types:

   1.  The last subordinate identity in the 'alarm-type-id' hierarchy is
       concrete, for example: "alarm-identity.environmental-
       alarm.smoke".  In this example "alarm-identity" and
       "environmental-alarm" are abstract YANG identities, whereas
       "smoke" is a concrete YANG identity.

   2.  The YANG identity hierarchy is abstract and the concrete alarm
       type is defined by the dynamic alarm qualifier string, for
       example: "alarm-identity.environmental-alarm.external-detector"
       with alarm-type-qualifier "smoke".

   For example:

     // Alternative 1: concrete alarm type identity
     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity environmental-alarm {
       base al:alarm-type;
       description "Abstract alarm type";
     }
     identity smoke {
       base environmental-alarm;
       description "Concrete alarm type";
     }

     // Alternative 2: concrete alarm type qualifier
     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity environmental-alarm {
       base al:alarm-type;
       description "Abstract alarm type";
     }
     identity external-detector {
       base environmental-alarm;
       description
         "Abstract alarm type, a run-time configuration
          procedure sets the type of alarm detected. This will
          be reported in the alarm-type-qualifier.";
     }

5.3.  How are Resources Identified?

   It is of vital importance to be able to refer to the alarming
   resource.  This reference must be as fine-grained as possible.  If
   the alarming resource exists in the data tree then an instance-
   identifier MUST be used with the full path to the object.

   This module also allows for alternate naming of the alarming resource
   if it is not available in the data tree.

5.4.  How are Alarm Instances Identified?

   A primary goal of this alarm module is to remove any ambiguity in how
   alarm notifications are mapped to an update of an alarm instance.
   X.733 and especially 3GPP was not really clear on this point.  This
   YANG alarm module states that the tuple (resource, alarm type
   identifier, alarm type qualifier) corresponds to the same alarm
   instance.  This means that alarm notifications for the same resource




Vallin & Bjorklund       Expires April 14, 2018                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module               October 2017


   and same alarm type are matched to update the same alarm instance.
   These three leafs are therefore used as the key in the alarm list:

     list alarm {
       key "resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier";
       ...
     }

5.5.  What is the Life-Cycle of an Alarm?

   The alarm model clearly separates the resource alarm life-cycle from
   the operator and administrative life-cycles of an alarm.

   o  resource alarm life-cycle: the alarm instrumentation that controls
      alarm raise, clearance, and severity changes.

   o  operator alarm life-cycle: operators acting upon alarms with
      actions like acknowledgment and closing.  Closing an alarm implies
      that the operator considers the corrective action performed.
      Operators can also shelf alarms in order to avoid nuisance alarms.

   o  administrative alarm life-cycle: deleting (purging) alarms and
      compressing the alarm status change list.  This module exposes
      operations to manage the administrative life-cycle.  The server
      may also perform these operations based on other policies, but how
      that is done is out of scope for this document.

5.5.1.  Resource Alarm Life-Cycle

   From a resource perspective, an alarm can have the following life-
   cycle: raise, change severity, change severity, clear, being raised
   again etc.  All of these status changes can have different alarm
   texts generated by the instrumentation.  Two important things to
   note:

   1.  Alarms are not deleted when they are cleared.  Deleting alarms is
       an administrative process.  The alarm module defines an rpc
       "purge" that deletes alarms.

   2.  Alarms are not cleared by operators, only the underlying
       instrumentation can clear an alarm.  Operators can close alarms.

   The YANG tree representation below illustrates the resource oriented
   life-cycle:

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module               October 2017


    +--ro alarm* [resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier]
          ...
       +--ro is-cleared                 boolean
       +--ro last-changed               yang:date-and-time
       +--ro perceived-severity         severity
       +--ro alarm-text                 alarm-text
       +--ro status-change* [time]
          +--ro time                    yang:date-and-time
          +--ro perceived-severity      severity
          +--ro alarm-text              alarm-text

   For every status change from the resource perspective a row is added
   to the 'status-change' list.  The last status values are also
   represented at leafs for the alarm.  Note well that the alarm
   severity does not include 'cleared', alarm clearance is a flag.

   An alarm can therefore look like this: ((GigabitEthernet0/25, link-
   alarm,""), false, T, major, "Interface GigabitEthernet0/25 down")

5.5.2.  Operator Alarm Life-cycle

   Operators can also act upon alarms using the set-operator-state
   action:

    +--ro alarm* [resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier]
       ...
       +--ro operator-state-change* [time] {operator-actions}?
       |  +--ro time        yang:date-and-time
       |  +--ro operator    string
       |  +--ro state       operator-state
       |  +--ro text?       string
       +---x set-operator-state {operator-actions}?
           +---w input
           +---w state    operator-state
           +---w text?    string

   The operator state for an alarm can be: 'none', 'ack', 'shelved', and
   'closed'.  Alarm deletion, 'rpc purge', can use this state as a
   criteria.  A closed alarm is an alarm where the operator has
   performed any required corrective actions.  Closed alarms are good
   candidates for being deleted.

5.5.3.  Administrative Alarm Life-Cycle

   Deleting alarms from the alarm list is considered an administrative
   action.  This is supported by the "purge-alarms" rpc.  The "purge-
   alarms" rpc takes a filter as input.  The filter selects alarms based
   on the operator and resource life-cycle such as "all closed cleared

   alarms older than a time specification".  The server may also perform
   these operations based on other policies, but how that is done is out
   of scope for this document.

   Alarms can be compressed.  Compressing an alarm deletes all entries
   in the alarm's "status-change" list except for the last status
   change.  A client can perform this using the "compress-alarms" rpc.
   The server may also perform these operations based on other policies,
   but how that is done is out of scope for this document.

5.6.  Root Cause and Impacted Resources

   The general principle of this alarm module is to limit the amount of
   alarms.  The alarm has two leaf-lists to identify possible impacted
   resources and possible root-cause resources.  The system should not
   send individual alarms for the posible root-cause resources and
   impacted resources.  These serves as hints only.  It is up to the
   client application to use this information to present the overall
   status.

5.7.  Alarm Shelving

   Alarm shelving is an important function in order for alarm management
   applications and operators to stop superfluous alarms.  A shelved
   alarm implies that any alarms fulfilling this criteria are ignored.
   Shelved alarms appear in a dedicated shelved alarm list in order not
   to disturb the relevant alarms.  Shelved alarms do not generate
   notifications.

6.  Alarm Data Model

   Alarm shelving and operator actions are YANG features so that a
   server can select not to support these.

   The data model has the following overall structure:

    +--rw alarms
       +--rw control
       |  +--rw max-alarm-status-changes?   union
       |  +--rw notify-status-changes?      boolean
       |  +--rw alarm-shelving {alarm-shelving}?
       |     +--rw shelf* [shelf-name]
       |        +--rw shelf-name              string
       |        +--rw resource?               resource
       |        +--rw alarm-type-id?          alarm-type-id
       |        +--rw alarm-type-qualifier?   alarm-type-qualifier
       |        +--rw description?            string
       +--ro alarm-inventory

6.1.  Alarm Control

   The "/alarms/control/notify-status-changes" leaf controls if
   notifications are sent for all state changes, severity change and
   alarm text change, or just for new and cleared alarms.

   Every alarm has a list of status changes, this is a circular list.
   The length of this list is controlled by "/alarms/control/max-alarm-
   status-changes".

6.1.1.  Alarm Shelving

   The shelving control tree is shown below:

   +--rw alarm-shelving {alarm-shelving}?
         +--rw shelf* [shelf-name]
               +--rw shelf-name              string
               +--rw resource?               resource
               +--rw alarm-type-id?          alarm-type-id
               +--rw alarm-type-qualifier?   alarm-type-qualifier

   Shelved alarms are shown in a dedicated shelved alarm list.  The
   instrumentation MUST move shelved alarms from the alarm list
   (/alarms/alarm-list) to the shelved alarm list (/alarms/shelved-
   alarms/).  Shelved alarms do not generate any notifications.  When
   the shelving criteria is removed or changed the alarm list MUST be
   updated to the correct actual state of the alarms.

   A leaf (/alarms/summary/shelfs-active) in the alarm summary indicates
   if there are shelved alarms.

   A system can select to not support the shelving feature.

6.2.  Alarm Inventory

   The alarm inventory represents all possible alarm types that may
   occur in the system.  A management system may use this to build alarm
   procedures.  The alarm inventory is relevant for several reasons:

      The system might not instrument all alarm type identities.

      The system has configured dynamic alarm types using the alarm
      qualifier.  The inventory makes it possible for the management
      system to discover these.

   Note that the mechanism whereby dynamic alarm types are added using
   the alarm type qualifier MUST populate this list.

   The optional leaf-list "resource" in the alarm inventory enables the
   system to publish for which resources a given alarm type may appear.

   The alarm inventory tree is shown below:

6.3.  Alarm Summary

   The alarm summary list summarises alarms per severity; how many
   cleared, cleared and closed, and closed.  It also gives an indication
   if there are shelved alarms.

6.4.  The Alarm List

   The alarm list (/alarms/alarm-list) is a function from (resource,
   alarm type, alarm type qualifier) to the current alarm state.

   Every alarm has three important states, the resource clearance state
   "is-cleared", the severity "perceived-severity" and the operator
   state available in the operator state change list.

   In order to see the alarm history the resource state changes are
   available in the "status-change" list and the operator history is
   available in the "operator-state-change" list.

6.5.  The Shelved Alarms List

   The shelved alarm list has the same structure as the alarm list
   above.  It shows all the alarms that matches the shelving criteria
   (/alarms/control/alarm-shelving).

6.6.  RPCs

   The alarm module supports rpcs/actions to manage the alarms:

      "purge-alarms" (RPC): delete alarms according to specific
      criteria, for example all cleared alarms older then a specific
      date.

      "compress" and "compress-alarms" rpcs: compress the status-change
      list for the alarms.

      "set-operator-state" action: change the operator state for an
      alarm: for example acknowledge.

6.7.  Notifications

   The alarm module supports a general notification to report alarm
   state changes.  It carries all relevant parameters for the alarm
   management application.

   There is also a notification to report that an operator changed the
   operator state on an alarm, like acknowledge.

   If the alarm inventory is changed, for example a new card type is
   inserted, a notification will tell the management application that
   new alarm types are available.

       "This module defines an interface for managing alarms.  Main
        inputs to the module design are the 3GPP Alarm IRP, ITU-T X.733
        and ANSI/ISA-18.2 alarm standards.

        Main features of this module include:

          * Alarm list:
                    A list of all alarms.  Cleared alarms stay in
                    the list until explicitly removed.

          * Operator actions on alarms:
                    Acknowledging and closing alarms.

          * Administrative actions on alarms:
                    Purging alarms from the list according to specific
                    criteria.

          * Alarm inventory:
                    A management application can read all
                    alarm types implemented by the system.

          * Alarm shelving:
                    Shelving (blocking) alarms according
                    to specific criteria.

        This module uses a stateful view on alarms.  An alarm is a state
        for a specific resource (note that an alarm is not a
        notification).  An alarm type is a possible alarm state for a
        resource.  For example, the tuple:

          ('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25')

        is an alarm of type 'link-alarm' on the resource
        'GigabitEthernet0/25'.

Internet-Draft              YANG Alarm Module               October 2017


        Alarm types are identified using YANG identities and an optional
        string-based qualifier.  The string-based qualifier allows for
        dynamic extension of the statically defined alarm types.  Alarm
        types identify a possible alarm state and not the individual
        notifications.  For example, the traditional 'link-down' and
        'link-up' notifications are two notifications referring to the
        same alarm type 'link-alarm'.

        With this design there is no ambiguity about how alarm and alarm
        clear correlation should be performed: notifications that report
        the same resource and alarm type are considered updates of the
        same alarm, such as clearing an active alarm or changing the
        severity of an alarm.

        The instrumentation can update 'severity' and 'alarm-text' on an
        existing alarm.  The above alarm example can therefore look
        like:

          (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
           warning,
           'interface down while interface admin state is up')

        There is a clear separation between updates on the alarm from
        the underlying resource, like clear, and updates from an
        operator like acknowledge or closing an alarm:

          (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
           warning,
           'interface down while interface admin state is up',
           cleared,
           closed)

        Administrative actions like removing closed alarms older than a
        given time is supported.";

8.  X.733 Alarm Mapping Data Model

   Many alarm management systems are based on the X.733 alarm standard.
   This YANG module allows a mapping from alarm types to X.733 event-
   type and probable-cause.

   The module augments the alarm inventory, the alarm list and the alarm
   notification with X.733 parameters.

   The module also supports a feature whereby the alarm manager can
   configure the mapping.  This might be needed when the default mapping
   provided by the system is in conflict with other systems or not
   considered good.

9.  X.733 Alarm Mapping YANG Module

   This YANG module references [X.736].

       "This module augments the ietf-alarms module with X.733 mapping
         information.  The following structures are augemented with
         event type and probable cause:

         1) alarm inventory: all possible alarms.
         2) alarm: every alarm in the system.
         3) alarm notification: notifications indicating alarm state
            changes.

         The module also optionally allows the alarm management system
         to configure the mapping.  The mapping does not include a
         a corresponding specific problem value.  The recommendation is
         to use alarm-type-qualifier which serves the same purpose.";

   This example shows how to define alarm-types in an enterprise

Appendix B.  Alarm Inventory Example

   This shows an alarm inventory, it shows one alarm type defined only
   with the identifier, and another dynamically configured.  In the
   latter case a digital input has been connected to a smoke-detector,
   therefore the 'alarm-type-qualifier' is set to "smoke-detector" and
   the 'alarm-type-identity' to "environmental-alarm".

Appendix D.  Alarm Shelving Example

   This example shows how to shelf alarms.  We shelf alarms related to
   the smoke-detectors since they are being installed and tested.  We
   also shelf all alarms from FastEthernet1/0.

Appendix E.  X.733 Mapping Example

   This example shows how to map a dynamic alarm type (alarm-type-
   identity=environmental-alarm, alarm-type-qualifier=smoke-alarm) to
   the corresponding X.733 event-type and probable cause parameters.

   <alarms xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-alarms"
           xmlns:xyz-al="urn:example:xyz-alarms">
     <control>
       <x733-mapping
