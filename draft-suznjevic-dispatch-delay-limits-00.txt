                  Delay Limits for Real-Time Services
                draft-suznjevic-dispatch-delay-limits-00

Abstract

   Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the
   Quality of Experience (QoE) of network services.  This document
   surveys a set of recommendations about the maximum latency tolerated
   by the users of services with delay constraints.  Some
   recommendations already exist for e.g.  VoIP, but emerging services
   as e.g. online gaming, have different requirements.  Different papers
   in the literature reporting these constraints are surveyed, and a
   summary of the latency limits for each service is provided.

1.  Introduction

   The "Workshop on Reducing Internet Latency" [Workshop], sponsored by
   the Internet Society and some research projects, discussed different
   ways for reducing Internet latency, stating that "For Internet
   applications, reducing the latency impact of sharing the
   communications medium with other users and applications is key."

   Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the
   Quality of Experience (QoE) of network services [RFC6390]
   [TGPP_TR26.944].  In order to prevent the degradation of the
   perceived quality of the services with delay constraints, a maximum
   limit can be defined.  This "latency budget" has to be taken into
   account when considering the possibility of adding new network
   functions (e.g.  through middleboxes), since every optimization adds
   some delay as a counterpart.  These new functions not only exist at
   upper layers, but they can also be found in Layer 2.  For example, in
   [IEEE.802-11N.2009], a number of Protocol Data Units can be grouped
   and transmitted together, but this will add a new delay required to
   gather a number of frames together.

   This document surveys a set of recommendations about the maximum
   latency tolerated by the users of services with delay constraints.

   Some recommendations already exist for e.g.  VoIP [ITU-T_G.114], but
   emerging services as e.g. online gaming, have different requirements,
   which may also vary with the game genre.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Considered services

2.1.  Real-time services

   Under the term "real-time network services" we consider both
   conversational and streaming service classes as defined in [TGPP_TS].
   Interactive and background services are considered non real-time.
   Fundamental requirements of real-time network services include
   conversational pattern (stringent and low delay) and preservation of
   the time relation (variation) between the information entities of the
   stream.

   We identify the following real-time network services, as those with
   the most stringent real-time constraints:

   o  Voice over IP

   o  Online games

   o  Remote desktop services

2.2.  Non real-time services

   Non real-time services such as streaming audio or video, and instant
   messaging also have delay limits, but different studies have shown
   that acceptable delays for these services are up to several seconds
   [ITU-T_G.1010].

   Some types of machine to machine (M2M) traffic (e.g., metering
   messages from various sensors) for these services can be go up to an
   hour [Liu_M2M].

3.  Definitions

   The three normally considered network impairments in the studies
   related to subjective quality in delay-constrained services are:

   o  delay - can be reported as one-way-delay (OWD) [RFC2679] and two-
      way-delay (Round Trip Time) [RFC2681].  In this document, under
      the term latency, one way end-to-end delay is considered.

   o  delay variation - which is a statistical variance of the data
      packet inter-arrival time, in other words the variation of the
      delay as defined in RFC 3393 [RFC3393].

   o  packet loss - more important for certain services, while other
      include very good algorithms for concealing it (e.g. some game
      genres receive accumulative updates, so packet loss is not
      important).

   In this document we give recommendations for overall tolerable delays
   to be taken into account when adding new middleboxes or
   functionalities in the network.  In an interactive service, the total
   delay is composed by the addition of delays as defined in 3GPP TR
   26.944 [TGPP_TR26.944].  The overall delay may be calculated
   according to the ITU-T Y.1541 recommendation [ITU-T_Y.1541].

   o  Transfer delay - from Host1 to Host2 at time T is defined by the
      statement: Host1 sent the first bit of a unit data to Host2 at
      wire-time T and that Host2 received the last bit of that packet at
      wire-time T+dT.  Thus, it includes the transmission delay (the
      amount of time Host1 requires to push all of the packet's bits
      into the wire) and the propagation delay in the network (the
      amount of time it takes for the head of the packet to travel from
      Host1 to Host2).

   o  Transaction delay - the sum of the time for a data packet to wait
      in queue and receive the service during the server transaction.

   Figure 1 illustrates these delays.  The labeled times (S and R)
   designate the times in which the packet is sent and received,
   respectively, by the network card interface.

4.  Delay recommendations

4.1.  VoIP

   For conversational audio, the International Telecommunication Union
   recommends [ITU-T_G.114] less than 150 millisecond one-way end-to-end
   delay for high-quality real time traffic, but delays between 150 ms
   and 400 ms are acceptable.  When considering conversational audio it
   should be noted that this delay limits include jitter buffers and
   codec processing.  For streaming audio, delay constraints are much
   looser, the delay should be less than 10 s [ITU-T_G.1010].

4.2.  Online games

   Online games comprise game genres which have different latency
   requirements.  This draft focuses on real-time online games and
   endorses the general game categorization proposed in
   [Claypool_Latency] in which online games have been divided into:





Suznjevic & Saldana       Expires June 13, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           Delay Limits Real-Time            December 2015


   o  Omnipresent, with the threshold of acceptable latency (i.e.,
      latency in which performance is above 75% of the unimpaired
      performance) of 1000 ms.  The most representative genre of
      omnipresent games are Real-Time Strategies.

   o  Third Person Avatar, with the threshold of acceptable latency of
      500 ms.  These games include Role Playing Games (RPG) and
      Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG).

   o  First Person Avatar, in which threshold of acceptable latency is
      100 ms.  The most popular subgenre of them are First Person
      Shooters, such as "Call of Duty" or "Halo" series.

   As remarked in [Bernier_Latency] and [Oliveira_online], different
   methods can be employed to combat delay in online games.  The so-
   called "client-side prediction" has been largely used in First Person
   Shooters.  It can be divided into "input prediction" and "dead
   reckoning," where input prediction hides the latency for the client-
   controlled actions while dead reckoning hides the latency of other
   participating players.

   The study [Claypool_Latency] evaluated players' performance in
   certain tasks, while increasing latency, and reported values at which
   the performance dropped below 75% of the performance under unimpaired
   network conditions.  While measuring objective performance metrics,
   this method highly underestimates the impact of delays on players'
   QoE.  Further studies accessing a particular game genre reported much
   lower latency thresholds for unimpaired gameplay.

   Other approach some studies have taken is to perform "objective
   measurements" [Kaiser_objective] a number of identical "bots", i.e.
   virtual avatars controlled by Artificial Intelligence, are placed in
   the same virtual scenario and a number of parties between them are
   performed.  If the number of parties if high enough, then the score
   will be the same for all the bots.  Then, different network
   impairments (latency, jitter, packet loss) are added to one of the
   bots, and another set of tests is performed.  The performance
   degradation of the network-impaired bot can then be statistically
   characterized.

   A survey using a large number of First Person Shooter games has been
   carried out in [Dick_Analysis].  They state that latency about 80 ms
   could be considered as acceptable, since the games have been rated as
   "unimpaired".  Besides service QoE, it has been shown that delay has
   great impact on the user's decision to join a game, but significantly
   less on the decision to leave the game [Henderson_QoS].

Internet-Draft           Delay Limits Real-Time            December 2015


   A study on Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluation, based on variation of
   delay and jitter for MMORPGs, suggested that MOS drops below 4 for
   delays greater than 120 ms [Ries_QoEMMORPG].  The MOS score of 5
   indicates excellent quality, while MOS score of 1 indicates bad
   quality.  Another study focused on extracting the duration of play
   sessions for MMORPGs from the network traffic traces showed that the
   session durations start to decline sharply when round trip time is
   between 150 ms and 200 ms [Chen_HowSensitive].

   While original classification work [Claypool_Latency] states that
   latency up to 1 second is tolerated by omnipresent games, other
   studies argued that only latency up to 200 ms is tolerated by players
   of RTS games [Cajada_RTS].

4.3.  Remote desktop access

   For the remote computer access services, the delays are dependent on
   the task performed through the remote desktop.  Tasks may include
   operations with audio, video and data (e.g., reading, web browsing,
   document creation).  A QoE study indicates that for audio latency
   below 225 ms and for data latency below 200 ms is tolerated
   [Dusi_Thin].

4.4.  Non real-time service

   Under this category we include services for M2M metering information,
   streaming audio, and instant messaging.  M2M metering services
   present a one way communication (i.e., most information travels from
   sensors to the central server) [Liu_M2M].  The signalling information
   related to M2M can also be optimized.  Internet of Things application
   layer protocols such as CoAP RFC 7252 [RFC7252], used in Constrained
   RESTful Environments (CoRE)[RFC6690].  The ACK_TIMEOUT period in CoAP
   is set to 2 seconds.  Instant messaging (despite "instant" in its
   name) has been categorized as data service by the ITU-T, and it has
   been designated with acceptable delays of up to a few seconds
   [ITU-T_G.1010].

4.5.  Summary

   We group all the results in the Table 1 indicating the maximum
   allowed latency and proposed multiplexing periods.  Proposed
   multiplexing periods are guidelines, since the exact values are
   dependant of the existing delay in the network.  It should be noted
   that reported tolerable latency is based on values of preferred
   delays, and delays in which QoE estimation is not significantly
   degraded.  Multiplexing periods of about 1 second can be considered
   as sufficient for non real-time services (e.g., streaming audio).
