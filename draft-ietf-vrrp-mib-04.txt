Abstract

   This specification defines an extension to the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network management.  In
   particular, it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and
   controlling routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy 
   Protocol (VRRP) [1].
 
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant
   with both the SNMPv2 SMI [5], and semantically identical to the SNMPv1
   definitions [2].

1.   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
 
   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:
 
   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [5] - the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
 
   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [4] - the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
 
   o    the protocol, STD 15, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [6], - the 
        protocol for accessing managed objects.
 
   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.


1.1  Object Definitions
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [5] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.
 
   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [9],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

2.0  Overview

   This memo identifies the set of objects for configuring, monitoring, 
   and controlling the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), as 
   defined in RFC 2338 [1]. 

   VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically allows a set of
   routers running VRRP to backup each other on a LAN.  The VRRP router
   controlling one or more IP addresses is called the "master router" and
   forwards packets sent to these IP addresses. In the event that the 
   master router fails, a backup VRRP router assumes the packet fowarding 
   responsibilities of the failed router. Thus, IP packets with the 
   destination address of the failed router will be fowarded by another
   VRRP router that has assumed control. Hence, VRRP provides redundancy  
   in routed networks without requiring configuration of dynamic
   routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.


2.1  VRRP MIB Structure

    The VRRP MIB contains three conformance groups:
 
    - vrrpOperations Group: Objects related to VRRP router's configuration
      and control.

    - vrrpStatistics Group: Objects containing information useful in
      monitoring the operation of VRRP routers.

    - vrrpNotifications Group: Consists of objects and definitions for
      use in SNMP traps sent by VRRP routers.

   Tables in the MIB include the following:

   (1) The vrrpOperTable, which contains objects that define the operational
       characteristics of a VRRP router. Rows in this table correspond to 
       instances of virtual routers.

   (2) The vrrpAssoIpAddrTable, which contains the addresses of the
       virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up.

   (3) The vrrpRouterStatsTable which contains the operating statistics 
       for a VRRP router.

2.2  Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol

   This MIB is based on the following characteristics of VRRP as defined
   in the VRRP specification [1].

   - A "VRRP router" is one that is configured to run the VRRP protocol
     in conjunction with one or more other VRRP routers attached to a LAN. 

   - A VRRP router can be running one or more instances of a virtual 
     router. 

   - A "virtual router" is an abstraction which consists of two
     or more physical routers. A virtual router essentially identifies
     a pool of physical routers that are capable of providing routing 
     services for one or more associated IP addresses in the event of 
     a failure of a router that is a member of the virtual router group.

   - An instance of a virtual router (on a physical VRRP router), can be  
     uniquely identified by a combination of the 'IF Index' [4] and 
     "Virtual Router Identifier" (VRID). 

   - For each VRID there is a set of one or more "associated IP addresses"
     that are backed-up by the virtual router.


2.3  VRRP MIB Table Design

   The tables in the VRRP MIB are structured with the assumption that 
   a VRRP network management application would likely be designed to
   display information or provide configuration about a VRRP router on a
   "per-virtual-router basis". Thus, the tables defined in the MIB
   consist of conceptual rows which are grouped in a manner to present 
   a view of individual virtual routers with a minimal number of SNMP
   operations.


2.3.1 Relation to Interface Group (RFC 1573) [8].

   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more physical
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in 
   the VRRP MIB.

2.4  VRRP Scenarios

   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects
   in this MIB are instantiated for two different VRRP scenarios. 

   KEY:
   ----
   The labels in the following table diagrams correspond to the actual 
   MIB objects as follows:

   if      = vrrpOperIfIndex
   VrId    = vrrpOperVrId
   State   = vrrpOperState
   Prior   = vrrpOperPriority
   AddrCnt = vrrpOperIpAddrCount
   IpAddr  = vrrpOperMasterIpAddr
   RowStat = vrrpOperRowStatus


2.4.1  VRRP Scenario #1
   
   The following figure shows a simple network with two VRRP routers
   configured with two virtual routers. This sample topology is taken 
   from the VRRP specification [1]. Addresses in '()' indicate the IP 
   address of the default gateway for a given host, H1 - H4. In the
   diagram, "Interface" is used in the context defined in MIB-II [4].

            The rowstatus of a currently active row in the vrrpOperTable  
            is also constrained by the operational state of the 
            corresponding virtual router. Prior to setting this object 
            from `active' to a different value, the `vrrpOperAdminState'  
            object must be set to `down', and the `vrrpOperState' object  
            be transitioned to `initialize'.

            The rowstatus column has six defined values:

                 - `active' (read/set). When this value is read, it 
                 indicates that all the read-create objects (in the row)  
                 required for virtual router operation have been 
                 correctly initialized such that the respective virtual 
                 router can be made operational by setting the 
                 `vrrpOperAdminState' to `up'. When set to `active',
                 no other objects in the conceptual row, with the 
                 exception of `vrrpOperAdminState', can be modified.

                 When set, the agent will transition the value of 
                 rowstatus to `notReady' if the row is incomplete.

                 - `notInService' (read/set), which when set, allows the  
                 objects in the row to be modified by a management station, 
                 thus changing the operational characteristics of the 
                 corresponding virtual router.

                 - `notReady' (read). The agent sets the object to this 
                 state to indicate that the conceptual row exists, 
                 but is lacking initialization of one or more objects 
                 required for virtual router operation.

                 - `createAndGo' (set), which is set by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 virtual router and to have its status automatically 
                 set to `active', making it available for use by a 
                 virtual  router. Upon receiving a request to set the 
                 rowstatus to this value, the agent transitions the 
                 rowstatus to `active' if the other settable objects 
                 in the row have been correctly initialized. If the 
                 row is incomplete, the agent transitions the state to 
                 `notReady'.

                 - `createAndWait' (set), which is set by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 virtual router but not make it available for use.
                 When this value is set, rowstatus transitions to
                 `notInService' if the row has been correctly 
                 initialized; if the row is incomplete, rowstatus will 
                 become `notReady'.

                 - `destroy' (set), which deletes the conceptual row, 
                 and hence, the corresponding instance of a virtual 
                 router."

This section tracks changes made during revisions of this document. It
will be deleted when the document is published as an RFC.

* January, 1999: Changes in 4th revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-04.txt):

  - "vrrpNodeVersion" SYNTAX changed from OCTET STRING to INTEGER.
  - Removed the REFERENCE clause from "vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr", as it
    was deemed redundant.
  - The range of vrrpOperAddrCount was changed from (1..255) to
    (0..255). This reflects the fact that a row might be created
    in the vrrpOperTable *prior* to creating a row in the
    vrrpAssoIpAddrTable.
  - Removed DEFVAL clause from "vrrpOperAuthKey" as unnecessary.
  - Moved the following objects out of the "vrrpRouterStatsTable"
    to become "global" VRRP router objects: "vrrpStatsChecksunErrors",
    "vrrpStatsVersionErrors", "vrrpStatsVrIdErrors". Each of these
    was renamed "vrrpRouter*", accordingly (since they are no longer
    members of the vrrpRouterStatsTable. The reason for this change
    is that, when any of these events occur, attempting to map the
    packet, with possible corruption of the VRID (or other fields),
    into a row of the vrrpRouterStatsTable would be risky, at best.
  - Removed "vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr" from the "vrrpTrapNewMaster".
    Since the virtual MAC can be derived from the VR ID, this was
    extra payload in the trap.
  - removed "vrrpTrapConfigErrorType" and "vrrpTrapPacketSrc"
    from conformance groups, as these are not mandatory objects.
  - Added new object, "vrrpOperPrimaryIpAddr" to vrrpOperTable.
    This object allows for designation of the vrrp IP primary 
    address on an interface with multiple IP addresses, should this
    virtual router transition from backup to master.
  - Changed vrrpRouterStatsEntry to AUGMENT the vrrpOperEntry, since
    there is a one-to-one correspondence between these two objects
    and they are indexed with identical parmeters. 
  - Addded new object, vrrpStatsPacketLengthErrors, to the statistics
    table.
  - Changed the description for "vrrpStatsSecurityViolations" to apply
    to *all* types of authentication failures, as opposed to
    cleartext auth failures only, which it previously stated.
  - Renamed "vrrpTrapConfigErrorType" object to "vrrpTrapAuthErrorType"
    and added a new enumeration for "authentication failures".
  - Renamed "vrrpStatsAuthTypeErrors" to "vrrpStatsAuthTypeMismatch".
  - Renamed "vrrpStatsSecurityViolations" to " vrrpStats-
    AuthenticationFailures"


* November, 1998: Changes in 3rd revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-03.txt):

  - Changed name of "vrrpAssoIpAddrStatus" object to 
    "vrrpAssoIpAddrRowStatus" for consistancy with similar object
    in vrrpOperTable.
  - Changed name of "vrrpOperControl" object to "vrrpOperAdminState"
    and enhanced description clause.
  - Renumbered the objects in both the vrrpOperTable and 
    vrrpAssoIpAddrTable. The first objects in the tables started
    with an OID of '2', when they should have started with '1'.
  - Changed the name of "vrrpStatsUnknownAuthType" to 
    "vrrpStatsInvalidAuthType" as per suggestion that it was
    more concise.
  - Rewrote the descriptions for the table Entry objects and the
    rowstatus objects to make the process of row creation and
    deletion more clear. Each enumeration of the rowstatus
    object in the "vrrpOperTable" is now clearly explained.
  - Changed MAX-ACCESS to "read-create" on the "vrrpOperAuthType"
    and "vrrpOperAuthKey" objects. This was done with the 
    assumption the the VRRP RFC will change to make these 
    attributes defined on a "per-virtual-router-basis" as
    was proposed at the August (1998) IETF Meeting.


* July, 1998: Changes in 2nd revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-02.txt):

  - A number of changes were made to the textual content of the
    draft as per feedback received at the last WG meeting. These 
    changes were too numerous to document individually in this
    section.
  - The size of the "vrrpNodeVersion" object has been changed from
    2 octets to 1 octet.
  - References to obsoleted RFC's have been replaced by references
    to later documents. Notably, references to RFC's 1442, 1443 and 
    1444 have been replaced by RFC 1902, RFC 1903 and RFC 1904,
    respectively.
  - The description for the "vrrpOperControl" was changed to
    reflect the fact that a virtual router does not necessarily
    transition directly from initialize state -> backup state.
    The description for the "vrrpStatsBecomeMaster" was also 
    changed to more accurately convey this fact.
  - The SYNTAX of the "vrrpOperIpAddrCount" was changed to 
    reflect the fact that a virtual router can support only up
    to 255 backup IP addresses.
  - Descriptions for vrrpOperAuthType and vrrpOperAuthKey expanded
    to indicate the per-interface assignment.
  - SYNTAX of vrrpOperPreemptMode object changed from INTEGER
    to 'truthValue'
  - The OIDs for the VRRP traps were fixed; incorrect ident-
    ifiers ('vrrpOperations') had been used in OID assignments.
  - The SYNTAX for the 'vrrpOperPriority' object was corrected 
    to indicate that this can have a value of '0'.
  - The vrrpOperHMACMD5Key object was deleted. It was combined
    with the vrrpOperAuthKey object, whose SYNTAX was adjusted
    accordingly.
  - OID for 'vrrpTraps' changed to '{ vrrpNotifications 1 }'
  - The 'vrrpStatsPasswdSecurityViolations' and 'vrrpStatsHmac-
    SecurityViolations' objects have been combined into a 
    single 'vrrpStatsSecurityViolations' object; this was
    suggested to avoid redundancy.
  - As per the last WG meeting, the 'vrrpAssoIpAddrIndex' object 
    has been deleted from the 'vrrpAssoIpAddrTable'and replaced 
    by 'vrrpAssoIpAddr'.
  - Removed references to 'vrrpAssoIpAddrIndex' in samples.
  - Added new object 'vrrpOperProtocol' to 'VrrpOperEntry'.
  - MAX-ACCESS for the 'vrrpOperVrId' object changed to
    'not-accessible', as per RFC1902 (auxilary objects).
  - SYNTAX for 'vrrpOperVirtualRouterUpTime' changed to 
    'TimeStamp'.
  - Added importation of 'TruthValue'and 'TimeStamp' to accomodate
    changes listed above. Deleted importation of 'TimeTicks'.
  - Changed MAX-ACCESS to 'accessible-for-notify' for 
    'vrrpTrapPacketSrc' and 'vrrpTrapConfigErrorType' objects.
  - In the sample tables, the "if" values were incorrect for
    the sample tables for "IP B" (they used to read "I1").
  - MAX-ACCESS for 'vrrpOperAuthType' and 'vrrpOperAuthKey' 
    changed to 'read-only', since these objects are defined on
    a per-interface basis.
  - Overall review and editing of Section 5.0 (References) with 
    deletion of references not used in this document. Also, added
    reference '9'.

  Concerns:
  ---------
  - Keep the 'vrrpTrapAuthFailure' trap?
  - Remove 'vrrpTrapPacketSrc' and 'vrrpTrapConfigErrorType' from 
    compliances? Only used for 'vrrpTrapAuthFailure' trap.


* 3/4/1998: Changes in 1st revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-01.txt):

  - Overall review and editing of document text and object 
    descriptions from feedback received at December 1997 IETF meeting. 
    More specifically the changes made along these lines include
    the following:

    -- Cleaned up Section 5.0 ("References") and validated.
    -- Modifed diagram for VRRP Scenario #2 (Section 2.4.2).
    -- VRRP Overview (Section 2.0) rewritten to be more in-line with 
       latest revision (05) of VRRP RFC Draft.
    -- Description of "VrId" Textual convention rewritten.

  - MAX-ACCESS of vrrpTrapCntl object changed to "read-write".
  - Changed SYNTAX of "vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr" object from 
    "PhyAddress" to "MacAddress".
  - Changed the syntax of the "vrrpOperPriority" object so upper
    value can be 255.
  - Change MAX-ACCESS for "vrrpOperAuthType" object from 
    read-only to read-create.
  - Added three new objects to "vrrpRouterStatsTable": 
    "vrrpStatsAddressListErrors", "vrrpStatsUnknownAuthType"
    and "vrrpStatsAuthTypeErrors".
  - Removed "vrrpStatsUnknownPacketType" object, as it was 
    redundant (with "vrrpStatsInvalidPacketType").
  - Removed the "vrrpOperIfIndex" object to use "ifIndex" (which is
    actually equivalent) instead.


* 11/19/97 (vft-ietf-vrrp-mib-00.txt) - Initial Draft
