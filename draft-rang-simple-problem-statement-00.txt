Abstract

   SIMPLE based presence systems today require a unique dialog to be
   established between every unique presentity-watcher pair.  Even
   though some optimizations have been suggested to the protocol, in
   cases where many users within a domain are subscribed to a number of
   users in another domain, the number of subscriptions between domains

   and concludes that additional optimizations are necessary.  It also
   suggests an initial list of requirements for these optimizations.

2.  Introduction

   SIMPLE based presence systems today are based on RFCs 3265 [2] and
   3856 [3].  These systems require a unique dialog to be established
   between every unique presentity-watcher pair.

   Even though some optimizations are approved or are being defined, we
   show in this document that a very large number of messages are needed
   in order to establish federation between presence systems of large
   communities.  Further thinking is needed in order to make large
   deployment of presence systems less resource demanding.

   The term presence domain or presence system appears in this document
   several time.  By this term we refer to an presence system that
   provides presence subscription and notification services to its
   users.  The system can be a system that is deployed in a small
   enterprise or in a very large consumer network.

2.1.  Known Optimizations

   The current optimizations that are approved or considered in the
   SIMPLE group can be divided into two categories:

   o  Dialogs saving optimization - Here we refer to optimizations as
      the even list draft [4] or to the uri list subscriptions draft
      [5].  These documents define ways to reduce the number of dialogs
      that are required between the subscriber and the presence system.

   o  Notification optimizations - Here we refer to the optimizations
      that are suggested in the subnot-etags draft [6].  This draft
      suggests ways to suppress the sending of unnecessary notifies when
      for example a subscription is refreshed.  There are other drafts
      that reduce the size of messages as partial notifies or filtering
      but in this document we mostly care about the amount of messages.

3.  Analysis

   The basic SIMPLE subscription dialog involves the following message-
   transfer:

   o  SUBSCRIBE/200

   o  Initial NOTIFY/200

   o  (j) NOTIFY/200 where 'j' is the number of presence changes seen by
      the watcher

   o  (k) SUBSCRIBE/200 where 'k' is the number of subscription dialog
      refresh periods

   o  SUBSCRIBE/200 with Expires = 0 to terminate the dialog

   o  NOTIFY/200 ending the dialog

   An individual watcher will generate X number of SIMPLE subscription
   dialogs corresponding to the number of presentities it chooses to
   watch.  The amount of traffic generated is significantly affected by
   several factors:

   o  Number of watchers connected to the system

   o  Number of presentities connected to the system

   o  Complexity of presence & frequency of presence change

   This document contains several calculations that show the expected
   message rate between presence domains.  The following explains the
   assumptions and methods behind the calculations:

   o  (A01) Subscription lifetime (hours)- The assumed lifetime of a
      subscription in hours.  Here we assume 8 hours for all
      calculations.

   o  (A02) Presence state changes / hour - The average time that a
      presentity changes his/hers status in one hour.  We assumed 3
      times a hour for most calculations.  Note that for some users in
      consumer messaging systems, the actual numbers are likely to be
      much higher.

   o  (A03) Subscription refresh interval / hour - The duration of the
      SUBSCRIBE session after which it needs to be refreshed.  We
      assumed that the duration is one hour.

   o  (A04) Total federated presentities per watcher - The number of
      presentities that the watcher is watching.  The number here
      changes in this document according to the type of the specific
      deployment

   o  (A05) Number of dialogs to maintain per watcher - The number of
      the SUBSCRIBE dialogs that are maintained per watcher. if a dialog
      optimization is not assumed this number is equal to A4, otherwise
      it is 1

   o  (A06) Number of watchers in a federated presence domain - The
      number of watchers in one presence domain that watch users in the
      other domain.  The number here varies according to the assumptions
      for a specific deployment

   o  (A07) Initial SUBSCRIBE/200 per watcher = A5*2 (message and an OK)

   o  (A08) Initial NOTIFY/200 per watcher = A5*2 (message and an OK)

   o  (A09) Total initial messages = (A7+A8)*A6

   o  (A10) NOTIFY/200 per watched presentity = (A2*A1*A4*2) (message
      and an OK)

   o  (A11) SUBSCRIBE/200 refreshes = (A1/A3)*A5*2 (message and an OK)

   o  (A12) NOTIFY/200 due to subscribe refresh - In a deployment where
      the notification optimization is not deployed this number will be
      ((A1/A3)*A5), otherwise it is 0

   o  (A13) Number of steady state messages = (A10+A11+A12)*A6

   o  (A14) SUBSCRIBE termination = A5*2 (message and an OK)

   o  (A15) NOTIFY terminated = A5*2 (message and an OK)

   o  (A16) Number of sign-out messages = (A7+A8)*A6

   o  (A17) Total messages between domains (both directions where users
      from domain A subscribe to users from domain B and vice versa)=
      (A9+A13+A16)*2

   o  (A18) Total number of messages / second = A17/A1/3600 (seconds in
      hour)

4.  SIMPLE with no optimizations

   The following table uses some common presence characteristics to
   demonstrate the effect these factors have on state and message rate
   within a presence domain using base SIMPLE protocols without any
   proposed optimizations.  In this example, there are two presence
   domains, each with 20,000 federating users with an average of 4
   contacts in the peer domain

   (A01) Subscription lifetime (hours)...........................8
   (A02) Presence state changes / hour...........................3
   (A03) Subscription refresh interval / hour....................1
   (A04) Total federated presentities per watcher................4
   (A05) Number of dialogs to maintain per watcher...............4
   (A06) Number of watchers in a federated presence domain..20,000

   (A07) Initial SUBSCRIBE/200 per watcher.......................8
   (A08) Initial NOTIFY/200 per watcher..........................8
   (A09) Total initial messages............................320,000

   (A10) NOTIFY/200 per watched presentity.....................192
   (A11) SUBSCRIBE/200 refreshes................................64

5.  SIMPLE with suggested optimizations

   The same analysis provided above is repeated here with the assumption
   that both the dialog and the notification optimizations are applied.
   Note that while the sign-in (ramp up) and sign-out messages flows are
   positively affected, the steady state rates are not.

   The optimizations enable the creation of a single dialog to the other
   domain from each subscriber for the set of presentities it is
   subscribing to.  The optimizations also enable that there will be no
   need for a NOTIFY upon refreshing a SUBSCRIBE since the NOTIFY should
   not be sent in the refresh since it should be the same one as was
   sent when there was a state change for the presentity.

   (A01) Subscription lifetime (hours)...........................8
   (A02) Presence state changes /hour............................3
   (A03) Subscription refresh interval / hour....................1
   (A04) Total federated presentities per watcher................4
   (A05) Number of dialogs to maintain per watcher...............1
   (A06) Number of watchers in a federated presence domain..20,000

   (A08) Initial NOTIFY/200 per watcher..........................2
   (A09) Total initial messages.............................80,000

   (A10) NOTIFY/200 per watched presentity.....................192
   (A11) SUBSCRIBE/200 refreshes................................16
   (A12) NOTIFY/200 due to subscribe refresh.....................0
   (A13) Number of steady state messages.................4,160,000

   (A14) SUBSCRIBE termination...................................2
   (A15) NOTIFY terminated.......................................2
   (A16) Number of sign-out messages........................80,000

   (A17) Total messages between domains..................8,640,000

6.  Presence Federations

   While these scalability issues exist in any large deployment, certain
   characteristics make the deployment conducive to the existing
   resource- list optimizations, and others have characteristics that
   cannot be exploited with the existing SIMPLE model.  Following is a
   list of federation relationships that have varying usage
   characteristics.  For each, a message rate table is provided
   reflecting typical changes message rates.  Those characteristics can
   alter the overall effectiveness of existing optimizations.

6.1.  Widely distributed inter-domain presence

   In some environments presence federation may be very common, perhaps
   even more common than intra-domain presence.  An example of this type
   of environment is a small ISV or public server.  Users in that small
   ISV are not likely to subscribe to the presence of other users in the
   their server since they do not necessarily have any relationship with
   each other aside from receiving service from the same provider.  They
   are much more likely to be subscribed to the presence of users in one
   of the federated domains (whether in consumer domains, academic,
   other ISVs, etc).  Common characteristics of this deployment are:

   o  Federated subscriptions are the majority of subscription traffic

   o  Individual users are likely to subscribe to multiple users in any
      one domain

   o  The intersection of users in the deployment watching the same
      presentities is quite small (i.e., probability that watchers in
      the domain subscribe to the same presentity)

   To account for the extraordinarily high percentage of federation
   traffic, the number of federated presentities is increased to 20.
   The number of watchers in the domain could also be adjusted to
   account for an expected larger community of users being peered with,
   it is omitted here for simplification

   The first table below provides the calculations without optimizations
   the second table provides the calculations with optimization.  Note
   that the number of messages per second decreases by a quarter with
   the optimizations but it is still quite big.

   (A18) Total number of messages / second...................1,367

         Widely distributed inter-domain with optimizations

6.2.  Associated inter-domain presence

   In this type of environment, the domain is a collection of associated
   users such as an enterprise.  Here, federation is once again very
   common.  However, there is also a strong association between some
   users in the deployment.  These associations make it somewhat more
   likely that users in that domain will be watchers of the same
   presentity.  This can occur because of business relationships (e.g.
   two co-workers on a project federating with a partner company).

   Common characteristics of this deployment are:

   o  Federated subscriptions are large minority or small majority of
      subscription traffic

   o  Individual users are likely to subscribe to multiple users in any
      one domain, especially their own

   o  The intersection of users in the deployment watching the same
      presentities increases

   This federation type has traffic rates similar to the previous
   examples but with different levels of association of the users.

Internet-Draft      Problem Statement for SIP/SIMPLE           June 2006


6.3.  Very large network peering

   In this environment, two or more very large networks create a peering
   relationship allowing their users to subscribe to presence in the
   other domains.  Where as the number of users in other deployment
   types ranges from hundreds to several hundred thousand, these large
   networks host up to hundreds of millions of users.  Examples of these
   networks are large wireless carriers at the low end and consumer IM
   networks at the high end.

   Common characteristics of this deployment are:

   o  As users become accustomed to network boundaries disappearing,
      federated subscriptions become as common as subscriptions within
      the same domain

   o  Individual users are highly likely to want to see presence of
      multiple presentities in the peer network

   o  The intersection of users in the deployment watching the same
      presentities is very high (i.e., two or more users in network A
      are extremely likely to be watching a same user in network B)

   o  Status changes increase greatly due to typical observed consumer
      behavior

   The first table below provides the calculations without optimizations
   the second table provides the calculations with optimization.  Even
   though the optimization help a lot (almost cut the number of messages
   by half), the numbers are still very concerning.

6.4.  Intra-domain peering

   Within a particular domain, multiple presence infrastructures are
   deployed with users split between the two.  This scenario is unique
   in that federated messages do not pass outside the administrative
   domain's network.  The two infrastructures peer directly inside the
   domain.  A common example of this is an enterprise IT system with
   multiple independent vendor presence solutions deployed(e.g., a
   presence solution for desktop messaging deployed alongside a presence
   solution for IP telephony).

   Common characteristics of this deployment are

   o  The difference between subscriptions to presentities in one system
      vs. the other are completely arbitrary.  Any one presentity is as
      likely to be homed on one infrastructure as the other

   o  Active users are almost guaranteed of subscribing to many users in
      the peer infrastructure

   o  The level of intersection of presentities is extremely high

   though the relatively conservative numbers are used, the amount of

7.  Conclusions & Requirements

   We have shown several calculations of message rate between various
   type of SIP presence systems deployments.  These calculations show
   that the current suggested optimizations although effective in some
   circumstances and can reduce the traffic up to the 50%, there is
   still a very high volume traffic occur in SIP deployments of
   presence.  In order to make the deployment of SIP presence more
   effective additional optimizations are needed.

   The following is an initial list of very general requirements from
   the seeked for optimizations:

   Backward compatibility requirements

   o  The solution should not hinder the ability of existing SIMPLE
      clients and/or servers from peering with a domain or client
      implementing the solution.  No changes may be required of existing
      servers to interoperate

   o  It does NOT constrain any existing RFC functional or security
      requirements for presence

   o  Systems that are not using the new additions to the protocol
      should operate at the same level as they do today

   Policy, privacy, permissions requirements

   o  The solution does not limit the ability for presentities to
      present different views of presence to different watchers

   o  The solution does not restrict the ability of a presentity to
      obtain its list of watchers

   o  The solution MUST NOT create any new or make worse any existing
      privacy holes

   Scalability requirements

   o  It is highly desirable for inter-domain network to scale linearly
      as number of watchers and presentities increase linearly

   o  The solution SHOULD NOT require significantly more state in order
      to implement the solution

   o  It MUST be able to scale to tens of millions of concurrent users
      in each peer domain

   o  It MUST support a very high level of watcher/presentity
      intersections in various intersection models

   o  Protocol changes MUST NOT prohibit optimizations in different
      deployment models esp. where there is a high level of cross
      subscriptions between the domains

   Topology requirement

   o  The solution SHOULD allow for arbitrary federation topologies
      including direct peering and intermediary routing

8.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses scalability issues with the existing SIP/
   SIMPLE presence protocol.  Therefore, there are no security
   considerations to be considered for this document.
