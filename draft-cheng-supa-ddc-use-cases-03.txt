Internet-Draft   Use cases for DDC Applications in SUPA    February 2015


1.  Introduction

   The SUPA (Shared Unified Policy Automation) work aims at providing
   data models, including topology data models, network service specific
   data models, policy data models, for Operation and Management
   Application (OAMA) to easily, accurately, and efficiently select and
   use the available communication network capabilities.  An example of
   the data model can be found in
   [I-D.zaalouk-supa-configuration-model].  Operation and Management
   Application (OAMA) is used by an a communications service provider
   and/or operator to deploy and manage a communication network.  An
   example of OAMA is a set of actions used by an Operational Support
   System (OSS) entity to perform network configuration.  Several SUPA
   use cases have been introduced in the problem statement document.
   This document reviews various use cases for Distributed Data Center
   (DDC) applications.

   Take a large-scale Internet Data Center (IDC) operator as an example,
   it provides server hosting, leased line, value-added services to
   enterprises and ISPs, and has more than 10 data centers using over
   one Tbps of bandwidth in a capital city.  In this IDC network,
   traffic at each site is routed via configuring policy routes and
   adjusting routes prioritization to choose an outgoing link.  This
   type of static provisioning comes with high costs and poor
   operability.  Furthermore, the link bandwidth resources in the data
   centers are not efficiently utilized.

   DC and network may belong to different operators.  If a DC operator
   needs to configure network connecivity for DCs, they may need to
   coperate with network oprators.  Network operators can define and
   provide data models to enable this.

   This document illustrates several distributed datacenter (DDC)
   applications and explains how an operator could use SUPA to provide
   these applications.

4.  Challenges Faced by Data Center ISPs

   There are many challenges in traditional data centers: 1)
   infrastructure and network link is usually leased, depending on
   manual planning and design, which leads to low resource usage and
   high cost; 2) Service expansion is limited in a single physical DC.
   Each DC resource is isolated, so service and resource can only be
   deployed in one single DC; 3) VAS (Value Added Service) is
   provisioned via static configuration, which brings complex training,
   long service TTM time and poor flexibility.  This could not meet the
   requirements of complex use cases, e.g., lot of VAS devices,
   significant differences between various services.


5.  SUPA Benefits

   To solve the above challenges for data center ISPs, SUPA could be
   applied in the following ways:

   o  SUPA provides an open network architecture: Open architecture,
      unified architecture and unified planning, fast interconnection
      with third party cloud platform, support fast service innovation.

   o  SUPA provides overall DC resource integration: Network resource
      virtualization, inter-DC resource integration, virtual DC (vDC)
      service provisioning, unified inter-DC service, which reduces
      OPEX.

   o  SUPA provides automatic E2E service delivery: Network (including
      virtual network), computing, inter-DC management of storage
      resource, automatic service delivery, which improves operation
      efficiency.

   o  SUPA improves DDC network usage: Intelligent scheduling of DDC
      traffic, improving link usage.

   o  SUPA provides VAS service on-demand provisioning automatically:
      Create or delete VAS nodes on-demand, based on various service
      requirements; network forwarding policy based on the VAS routing,
      to achieve automatic draining and automatic configuration of VAS
      device policy.

   The following sections will illustrate three typical cases in
   distributed data center which could benefit from SUPA architecture.

   There can be a lot of links between data centers.  Configuration of
   these links is complex.  As shown in Figure 1, connectivity data
   models and policy data models can be defined to automate the
   configuration procedures.  The service data model for connectivity

   will specify attributes of links, e.g. the end points of links,
   bandwidth and QoS, etc.  The policy model can specify some high level
   requirements to the links, like routing strategy and price/cost
   stragety.

   Inter DC connections can be classified into to types: connections
   within a single administrative domain and connections across multiple
   administrative domains.  Links d1, d2 and d3 are within an
   administrative domain; and links a1, a2 and 3 are across domains.
   The difference between them is, connections across multiple
   administrative domain require extra negotiation and authentication/
   authorization, which can be achieved via communications between MAs.
   Data models for this purpose should also be defined.

                        Figure 2: vDC Connectivity

   A DC tenant may have resources, e.g. network, computing, storage,
   etc, in multiple physical DCs.  DC operators will provide internal
   network connections for these distributed resources, and make it look
   like one seamless entity, which can be called as virtual DC (vDC).



Cheng, et al.            Expires August 6, 2015                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Use cases for DDC Applications in SUPA    February 2015


   The internal links for vDC can be implemented via tunneling
   technologies, e.g.  VPN or VxLAN, etc.

   As show in Figure 2, connectivity data model and policy can be
   defined to automate the links configuration for vDCs.  A policy model
   may contain information like user's grade which will be use to derive
   service level parameters, including bandwidth, QoS, etc.  The
   connectivity data model may provide the information about the
   resource location for tunnel setup.

6.3.  Dynamic Link Configuration for DC

   Static and over provisioning for DC links is not always a good
   solution.  Sometimes dynamic configuration is necessary.

   One case is virtual machine migration and large amount of data
   transfer between DCs.  But this kind of activity does not happen
   frequently.  A dedicated link with constant bandwidth for this
   purpose is too expensive.  The network operator should allow the DC
   operator to create a link on demand when necessary.  This link may
   have large bandwidth but last for a limit time period.  An
   alternative is to have a static link but with limited bandwidth; and
   the bandwidth can be increased on demand for a short period.

   Data models can help to automate these kind of configurations.  These
   data models will help DC operators to add and remove links, change
   the attributes of links.

                     Figure 3: VPC to DC Connectivity

   As virtualization technology becomes more and more popular, some
   organizations and companies now begin to use cloud platform to
   support their computer desktop, rather than using physical personal
   computers and workstations.  The kind of cloud platform can be a
   commercial solution, e.g.  Amazon's cloud platform.  VPCs at cloud
   service providers' DC may keep on running for a long time even if no
   user is actually accessing it; but the cloud platform may bring VPCs
   into power saving mode when there is little or no load in it.

   The organizations and companies, e.g. a university, sometimes provide
   some internal services like database which is only available to the
   VPC but not available to users in the public network.  These kind of
   services can be located in an cloud operator's DC.

   The VPC and the internal services sometimes are located in different



Cheng, et al.            Expires August 6, 2015                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Use cases for DDC Applications in SUPA    February 2015


   DCs, or even provided by different vendors.  VPNs are configured for
   the VPCs to provide connection to the DCs where services are hosted.

   As shown in Figure 3, connectivity data models and policy data models
   can be defined to automate the configurations of links between VPC
   and DC where service is located.  In the data models, the location
   where internal service is located should be specified; a user/VPC's
   access rights can also be specified.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
   installation and extracting of detailed configuration states.  More
   investigation remains to fully define the security requirements, such
   as authorization and authentication levels.


8.  IANA Considerations

   Not applicable.
