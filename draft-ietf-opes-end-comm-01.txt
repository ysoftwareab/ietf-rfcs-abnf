1. Introduction

   The Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) architecture [8] enables
   cooperative application services (OPES services) between a data
   provider, a data consumer, and zero or more OPES processors.  The
   application services under consideration analyze and possibly
   transform application-level messages exchanged between the data
   provider and the data consumer.

   The execution of such services is governed by a set of rules
   installed on the OPES processor.  The rules enforcement can trigger
   the execution of service applications local to the OPES processor.
   Alternatively, the OPES processor can distribute the responsibility
   of service execution by communicating and collaborating with one or
   more remote callout servers. As described in [8], an OPES processor
   communicates with and invokes services on a callout server by using a
   callout protocol.

   The work specify the requirements for providing tracing functionality
   for the OPES architecture [8]. This document specifies tracing
   mechanisms that the OPES architecture could provide that enable data
   provider application to detect inappropriate clinet centric actions
   by OPES entities. The work focus on developing tracing requirements
   that can be used to fulfil the notification and Non-Blocking
   requirements [2].

   In the OPES architecture document [8], there is a requirement of
   relaying tracing information in-band. This work investigates this
   possibility and discusses possible methods that could be used to
   detect faulty OPES processors or callout servers by end points in an
   OPES flow.

   The document is organized as follows: Section 2 defines OPES Domain
   and OPES System. Section 3 discusses entities that are traceable in
   an OPES Flow. Sections 4 and 5 discuss tracing requirements for OPES
   systems and callout servers. Section 6 focus on Tracing and Trust
   Domains. Section 7 discusses how to support tracing and provides uses
   cases. Section 8 examines Optional Notofication.  Section 9 looks
   into IANA considerations. Section 10 examines security
   considerations.

2. OPES Domain and OPES System

   This sections clarifies the terms OPES system and OPES Domain [8].
   These terms are needed in order to define what is traceable in an
   OPES Flow [8].

   An OPES domain describes the collection of OPES entities that a
   single provider operates. OPES domains can be based on trust or other
   operational boundaries. All elements of an "OPES Domain" MUST be in
   the same trust domain. This would be independent of any specific OPES
   flow.

   An OPES system consists of a limited set of OPES entities, parts of a
   single or of multiple OPES operators domains, organized by (or on
   behalf) of either a data provider application or a data consumer
   application to perform authorized services on a given application
   message. Each OPES entity in an OPES system MUST be directly
   addressable on IP level by a data consumer application.

   An OPES system can be formed in a recursive manner. An OPES system
   can start with either a data provider application or a data consumer
   application (for a given message). The OPES system then includes any
   OPES entity trusted by (accepting authority from) an entity that is
   already in the OPES system. The trust and authority delegation is
   viewed in the context of the given application message.

   As implied by the above definition, some OPES entities in the system
   may not participate in the processing of a given message.

   An OPES domain MUST not be an OPES sub-system. An OPES domain MUST
   require external resources to provide services. An OPES domain is a
   part of an OPES system belonging to a given operator. OPES domains
   have no incidence on the structure of an OPES system, but they may
   influence its organization for different reasons such as security,
   payment, quality of service, delivery parameters among others.

   In Figure 1 an OPES Flow is shown that traverses across various OPES
   Domains. A data consumer application MUST be able to recive tracing
   information on per message basis that enable it to determine the set
   of transformations that were perfomed on the data for a particular
   OPES Flow. The formation of an OPES flow can be static or dynamic,
   meaning that the determination of which OPES Domains will participate
   in a given OPES Flow (per message basis) can be a function of
   business arrangements.

3. OPES Tracing

   Before discussing what is traceable in an OPES flow, it is beneficial
   to define what tracing means. Tracing is defined as the inclusion of
   necessary information within a message in an OPES flow that could be
   used to identify the set of transformations or adpatations that have
   been performed on its content in an OPES System before its delivery
   to an end point (the data consumer application).

   o  OPES trace: application message information about OPES entities in
      an OPES System that adapted that message.

   o  OPES tracing: the process of including, manipulating, and
      interpreting an OPES trace in an OPES System.

   To emphasize, the above definition means that OPES tracing SHOULD be
   performed on per message basis. Trace format is dependent on the
   application protocol that is being adapted by OPES. Data consumer
   application can use OPES trace to infer the actions that have been
   performed by the OPES system.  The architecture document requires [8]
   that tracing be supported in-band.

   In an OPES System the task of providing tracing information, must
   take into account the following considerations:

   o  Providers may be hesitant to reveal information about their
      internal network infrastructure.

   o  Within a service provider network, OPES processors may be
      configured to use non-routable, private IP addresses.

   o  A Data consumer applications would prefer to have a single point
      of contact regarding the trace information.

   o  TBD


3.1 What is traceable in an OPES Flow?

   This section focuses on identifying the traceable entities in an OPES
   Flow.  Tracing information MUST be able to provide a data consumer
   application with useful information without tracing the exact OPES
   Processor or callout servers that adapted the data. It is up to the
   OPES service provider to have maintained appropriate internal
   detailed traces to find the answer to the data consumer applications
   inquiry.

   At the implementation level, for a given trace, an OPES entity

Internet-Draft    OPES processor and end points communications        September 2003


   involved in handling the corresponding application message is
   "traceable" or "traced" if information about it appears in that
   trace. OPES entities have different levels of traceability
   requirements. Specifically,

   o  An OPES system MUST add its entry to the trace.

   o  An OPES processor SHOULD add its entry to the trace.

   o  An OPES service SHOULD add its entry to the trace.

   o  An OPES entity MAY manage trace information from entities that are
      under its control. For example, an OPES processor may add or
      remove callout service entries in order to manage the size of a
      trace. Other considerations include:

      *  The OPES processor may have a fixed configuration that enable
         it to respond to tracing inquires.

      *  The OPES processor may insert a summary of the services that it
         controls. The summary can be used to respond to tracing
         inquiries.

      *  The OPES processor may package tracing information related to
         the entities that it control based on the policy of a given
         OPES System.

   From an OPES context, a good tracing approach is similar to a trouble
   ticket ready for submission to a known address. The trace in itself
   is not necessarily a detailed description of what has happened. It is
   the resposibility of the operator to resolve the problems.

3.2 Requirements for Information Related to Traceable Entities?

   The requirements for information as related to entities that are
   terceable in an OPES flow are:

   o  The privacy policy at the time it dealt with the message

   o  Identification of the party responsible for setting and  enforcing
      that policy

   o  Information pointing to a technical contact

   o  Information that identifies, to the technical contact, the OPES
      processors involved in processing the messag

   o  TBD

Internet-Draft    OPES processor and end points communications        September 2003


4. Requirements for OPES processors

   In order to facilitate compliance, the concept of an "OPES system"
   being traceable, requires that each OPES processor MUST support
   tracing.  Policy can be set that defines which domain has
   authorization to turn on tracing and its granularity.  An OPES
   provider can have its private policy for trace information, but it
   MUST support tracing mechanisms and it MUST reveal it's policy.

   The requirements for OPES processors that are applicatble to tracing
   are:

   o  Each OPES processor MUST belong to a single OPES Domain.

   o  Each OPES processor MUST have a Unique Identity in that Domain.

   o  Each OPES processor MUST support tracing, policy can be used to
      turn tracing on and.to determine granuality.

   o  TBD

Internet-Draft    OPES processor and end points communications        September 2003


5. Requirements for callout servers

   If it is the task of an OPES processor to add trace records to
   application messages, then callout servers that uses the OCP protocol
   are not affected by tracing requirements. In order for an OCP
   protocol to be tracing neutral, the OPES server SHOULD be able to
   meet the following requirements:

   o  Callout services adapt payload regardless of the application
      protocol in use and leave header adjustment to OPES processor.

   o  OPES processor SHOULD be able  to trace it's own invocation and
      service(s) execution since they understand the application
      protocol.

   o  Callout servers  MAY be able to add their own OPES trace records
      to application level messages.

   o  TBD

6. Privacy considerations


6.1 Tracing and Trust Domains

   A trust domain may include several OPES systems and entities. Within
   a trust domain, there MUST be at least support for one trace entry
   per system. Entities outside of that system may or may not see any
   traces, depending on domain policies or configuration. For example,
   if an OPES system is on the content provider "side", end-users are
   not guaranteed any traces. If an OPES system is working inside
   end-user domain, the origin server is not guaranteed any traces
   related to user requests.

Internet-Draft    OPES processor and end points communications        September 2003


7. How to Support Tracing

   In order to support tracing, the following aspects must be addressed:

   o  There MUST be a System Identifier that identify a domain that is
      employing an OPES system.

   o  An OPES processor MUST be able to be uniquely identified (MUST
      have an Identifier) within a system.

   o  An OPES processor MUST add its identification  to the trace.

   o  An OPES processor SHOULD add to the trace  identification of every
      callout service that received the application message.

   o  An OPES processor MUST add to the trace identification  of the
      "system/entity" it belongs to. "System" ID MUST make it possible
      to access "system" privacy  policy.

   o  An OPES processor MAY group the above information for sequential
      trace entries having  the same "system/entity" ID. In other words,
      trace  entries produced within the same "system/entity"  MAY be
      merged/aggregated into a single less detailed trace entry.

   o  An OPES processor MAY delegate trace management to  a callout
      service within the same "system/entity".

   TBD

7.1 Tracing and OPES System Granularity

   There are two distinct uses of traces. First, is to SHOULD enable the
   "end (content producer or consumer) to detect OPES processor presence
   within end's trust domain. Such "end" should be able to see a trace
   entry, but does not need to be able to interpret it beyond
   identification of the trust domain(s).

   Second, the domain administrator SHOULD be able to take a trace entry
   (possibly supplied by an "end? as an opaque string) and interpret it.
   The administrator must be able to identify OPES processor(s) involved
   and may be able to identify applied adaptation services along with
   other message-specific information. That information SHOULD help to
   explain what OPES agent(s) were involved and what they did. It may be
   impractical to provide all the required information in all cases.
   This document view a trace record as a hint, as opposed to an
   exhaustive audit.

   Since the administrators of various trust domains can have various

Internet-Draft    OPES processor and end points communications        September 2003


   ways of looking into tracing, they MAY require the choice of freedom
   in what to put in trace records and how to format them. Trace records
   should be easy to extend beyond basic OPES requirements. Trace
   management algorithms should treat trace records as opaque data to
   the extent possible.

   It is not expected that entities in one trust domain to be able to
   get all OPES-related feedback from entities in other trust domains.
   For example, if an end-user suspects that a served is corrupted by a
   callout service, there is no guarantee that the use will be able to
   identify that service, contact its owner, or debug it _unless_ the
   service is within my trust domain. This is no different from the
   current situation where it is impossible, in general, to know the
   contact person for an application on an origin server that generates
   corrupted HTML; and even if the person is known, one should not
   expect that person to respond to end-user queries.

7.2 Requirements for In-Band Tracing

   The OPES architecture [8] states that traces must be in-band. The
   support of this design specification is dependent on the specifics of
   the message application level protocol that is being used in an OPES
   flow. In-band tracing limits the type of application protocols that
   OPES can support. The details of what a trace record can convey is
   also dependent on the choice of the application level protocol.

   For these reasons, the work will document requirements for
   application protocols that need to support OPES traces. However, the
   architecture does not prevent implementers of developing out-of-band
   protocols and techniques to address the above limitation.

7.2.1 Tracing Information Granularity and Persistence levels
      Requirements

   In order to be able to trace entities that have acted on an
   application message in an OPES flow, there may be requirements to
   keep information that is related to the following:

   o  Message-related informatio: All data that describes specific
      actions performed on the message SHOULD be provided with that
      message, as there is no other way to find message level details
      later.

   o  Session related information: Session level data MUST be preserved
      for the duration of the session. OPES processor is responsible for
      inserting notifications if session-level information changes.

   o  End-point related data: What profile is activated? Where to get

      profile details? Where to set preferences?

   o  TBD


7.3 Protocol Binding

   How tracing is added is application protocol-specific and will be
   documented in separate drafts. This work documents what tracing
   information is required and some common tracing elements.

8. Optional Notification

   This section examines IAB [2] considerations (3.1) and (3.2)
   regarding notification in an OPES architecture.

   Notification propagates in opposite direction of tracing and cannot
   be attached to application messages that it notifies about.
   Notification can be done out-band and may require the development of
   a new protocol. The direction of data flow for tracing and
   notification are depicted in Figure 2.

                +-----------------------------------------------
                |                                               |
                |                                               V
          +---------------+            +-------+       +---------------+
          |               |            |       |       | Data Provider |

                                       +---------+
                                       | Callout |
                                       | Server  |
                                       +---------+



                      Figure 2: Notification Flow

   In [9] it was argued that Notification is an expensive approach for
   providing tracing information. However, the current work does not
   prevent an OPES System from publishing policy and specifications that
   allow Optional Notification. For example, an OPES System can adopt a
   mechanism that uses a flag that would allow a data consumer and a
   data provider application to signal to each other that they are
   interested to receive an explicit notification if an  OPES service is
   applied to a specific message. The value of this optional flag/field
   can be a URI that identifies notification method plus parameters. If
   a processor understands the method, it would be able to further
   decode the field and send a notification. The specification of  the
   field name and format for an  application protocol can be stated in
   the associated binding document. The details of the notification

   protocol is beyond the scope of this Working Group.

   For example, the following HTTP header:

   o  OPES-Notify: URI *(pname=pvalue)

   Or,

   o  My-OPES-Notify: foo=bar q=0.5

   can be used.
