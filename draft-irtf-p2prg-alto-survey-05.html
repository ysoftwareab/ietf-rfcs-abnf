<h1><br />A Survey on Research on the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) Problem<br />draft-irtf-p2prg-alto-survey-05</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
      A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by
      Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used traditionally for
      file-sharing, and more recently for real-time communications and
      live media streaming. Such applications discover a route to each
      other through an overlay network with little knowledge of the
      underlying network topology. As a result, they may choose peers
      based on information deduced from empirical measurements, which
      can lead to suboptimal choices. This document, a product of the
      P2P Research Group, presents a survey of existing literature on
      discovering and using network topology information for
      application-layer traffic optimization.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
      A significant part of today's Internet traffic is generated by
      Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, used originally for file
      sharing, and more recently for realtime multimedia
      communications and live media streaming.  P2P applications are
      posing serious challenges to the Internet infrastructure; by
      some estimates, P2P systems are so popular that they make up
      anywhere between 40% to 85% of the entire Internet traffic <a class='info' href='#Meeker'>[Meeker]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Meeker, M. and D. Joseph, &ldquo;The State of the Internet, Part 3,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#Karagiannis'>[Karagiannis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karagiannis, T., Broido, A., Brownlee, N., Claffy, K., and M. Faloutsos, &ldquo;Is P2P dying or just hiding?,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#LightReading'>[LightReading]<span> (</span><span class='info'>LightReading, &ldquo;Controlling P2P traffic,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#LinuxReviews'>[LinuxReviews]<span> (</span><span class='info'>linuxReviews.org, &ldquo;Peer to peer network traffic may account for up to 85% of Internetâ??s bandwidth usage,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#Parker'>[Parker]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Parker, A., &ldquo;The true picture of peer-to-peer filesharing,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#Glasner'>[Glasner]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Glasner, J., &ldquo;P2P fuels global bandwidth binge,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
    
</p>
<p>
      P2P systems ensure that popular content is replicated at
      multiple instances in the overlay.  But perhaps ironically, a
      peer searching for that content may ignore the topology of the
      latent overlay network and instead select among available
      instances based on information it deduces from empirical
      measurements, which, in some particular situations may lead to
      suboptimal choices.  For example, a shorter round-trip time
      estimation is not indicative of the bandwidth and reliability of
      the underlying links, which have more of an influence than delay
      for large file transfer P2P applications.
    
</p>
<p>
      Most Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) -- the data structure that
      imposes a specific ordering for P2P overlays -- use greedy
      forwarding algorithms to reach their destination, making locally
      optimal decisions that may not turn out to be globally optimized
      <a class='info' href='#Gummadi'>[Gummadi]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gummadi, K., Gummadi, R., Gribble, S., Ratnasamy, S., Shenker, S., and I. Stoica, &ldquo;The impact of DHT routing geometry on resilience and proximity,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.  This naturally leads to the
      Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem <a class='info' href='#RFC5693'>[RFC5693]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Seedorf, J. and E. Burger, &ldquo;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem           Statement,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>: how to best provide the topology of the
      underlying network while at the same time allowing the
      requesting node to use such information to effectively reach the
      node on which the content resides.  Thus, it would appear that
      P2P networks with their application layer routing strategies
      based on overlay topologies are in direct competition against
      the Internet routing and topology.
    
</p>
<p>
      One way to solve the ALTO problem is to build distributed
      application-level services for location and path selection <a class='info' href='#Francis'>[Francis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Francis, P., Jamin, S., Jin, C., Jin, Y., Raz, D., Shavitt, Y., and L.

Venkataramani., &ldquo;iPlane: an information plane for distributed services,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, in order to
      enable peers to estimate their position in the network and to
      efficiently select their neighbors.  Similar solutions have been
      embedded into P2P applications such as Azureus <a class='info' href='#Azureus'>[Azureus]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Azureus BitTorrent Client,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.  A slightly different approach is to have
      the Internet Service Provider (ISP) take a pro-active role in
      the routing of P2P application traffic; the means by which this
      can be achieved have been proposed <a class='info' href='#Aggarwal'>[Aggarwal]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, V., Feldmann, A., and C. Scheidler, &ldquo;Can ISPs and P2P systems co-operate for improved performance?,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>,

Bonaventure, &ldquo;Implementation and Preliminary Evaluation of an ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
      There is an intrinsic struggle between the layers -- P2P overlay
      and network underlay -- when performing the same service
      (routing), however there are strategies to mitigate this
      dichotomy <a class='info' href='#Seetharaman'>[Seetharaman]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Seetharaman, S., Hilt, V., Hofmann, M., and M. Ammar, &ldquo;Preemptive Strategies to Improve Routing Performance of           Native and Overlay Layers,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.

      maps on the physical network layer.  In their paper, relying
      only on measurements independently performed by overlay nodes
      without the support of additional location information provided
      by external entities, they demonstrate that the most efficient
      algorithms in terms of resilience and proximity performance are
      those based on the simplest geometric concept (i.e. the ring
      geometry, rather than tree structures, butterfly networks and
      hybrid geometries).

<p>
      Regardless of the geometrical properties of the distributed data
      structures involved, interactions between application-layer
      overlays and the underlying networks are a rich area of
      investigation.  The available literature in this field can be
      divided in two categories (<a class='info' href='#taxonomy'>Figure&nbsp;1</a>): using
      application-level techniques to estimate topology and through

Application-Level Topology Estimation</h3>

<p>
        Estimating network topology information on the application
        layer has been an area of active research. Early systems used
        triangulation techniques to bound the distance between two
        hosts using a common landmark host. In such a technique, given
        a cost function C, a set of vertexes V and their corresponding
        edges, the triangle inequality holds if for any triple {a, b,
        c} in V, C(a, c) is always less than or equal to C(a, g) +
        C(b, c). The cost function C could be expressed in terms of
        desirable metrics such as bandwidth or latency.
      
</p>
<p>
        We note that the techniques presented in this section are only
        representative of the sizable research in this area. Rather
        than trying to enumerate an exhaustive list, we have chosen
        certain techniques because they represent an advance in the
        area that further led to derivative works.
      
</p>
<p>
        Francis et al. proposed <a class='info' href='#Francis'>IDMaps<span> (</span><span class='info'>Francis, P., Jamin, S., Jin, C., Jin, Y., Raz, D., Shavitt, Y., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;IDMaps: A global Internet host distance estimation service,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [Francis],
        a system where one or more special hosts called tracers are
        deployed near an autonomous system. The distance measured in
        Round Trip Time (RTT) between hosts A and B is estimated as
        the cumulative distance between A and its nearest tracer Ta,
        plus the distance between B and its nearest tracer Tb, plus
        the shortest distance from Ta to Tb. To aid in scalability
        beyond that provided by the client-server design of IDMaps, Ng
        et al. proposed a P2P-based <a class='info' href='#Ng'>Global Network
        Positioning (GNP) architecture<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ng, T. and H. Zhang, &ldquo;Predicting internet network distance with coordinates-based approaches,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [Ng]. GNP was a network
        coordinate system based on absolute coordinates computed from
        modeling the Internet as a geometric space. It proposed a
        two-part architecture: in the first part, a small set of
        finite distributed hosts called landmarks compute their own
        coordinates in a fixed geometric space. In the second part, a
        host wishing to participate computes its own coordinates
        relative to those of the landmark hosts. Thus, armed with the
        computed coordinates, hosts can then determine interhost
        distance as soon as they discover each other.
      
</p>
<p>
        Both IDMaps and GNP require fixed network infrastructure
        support in the form of tracers or landmark hosts; this often
        introduces a single point of failure and inhibits
        scalability. To combat this, new techniques were developed
        that embedded the network topology in a low-dimensional
        coordinate space to enable network distance estimation through
        vector analysis. Costa et al. introduced <a class='info' href='#Costa'>Practical Internet Coordinates
        (PIC)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Costa, M., Castro, M., Rowstron, A., and P. Key, &ldquo;PIC: Practical Internet coordinates for distance estimation,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [Costa]. While PIC used the notion of landmark hosts, it
        did not require explicit network support to designate specific
        landmark hosts.  Any node whose coordinates have been computed
        could act as a landmark host.  When a node joined the system,
        it probed the network distance to some landmark hosts.  Then,
        it obtained the coordinates of each landmark host and computed
        its own coordinates relative to the landmark host, subject to
        the constraint of minimizing the error in the predicted
        distance and computed distance.
      
</p>
<p>
        Like PIC, <a class='info' href='#Dabek'>Vivaldi<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dabek, F., Cox, R., Kaashoek, F., and R. Morris, &ldquo;Vivaldi: A Decentralized Network Coordinate System,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [Dabek] proposed a fully
        distributed network coordinate systems without any
        distinguished hosts. Whenever a node A communicates with
        another node B, it measures the RTT to that node and learns
        that node's current coordinates.  A subsequently adjusts its
        coordinates such that it is closer to, or further from B by
        computing new coordinates that minimize the squared error.  A
        Vivaldi node is thus constantly adjusting it's position based
        on a simulation of interconnected mass springs.  Vivaldi is
        now being used in the popular P2P application Azureus and
        studies indicate that it scales well to very large networks
        <a class='info' href='#Ledlie'>[Ledlie]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ledlie, J., Gardner, P., and M. Seltzer, &ldquo;Network Coordinates in the Wild,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
      
</p>
<p>
        Network coordinate systems require the embedding of the
        Internet topology into a coordinate system. This is not always
        possible without errors, which impacts the accuracy of
        distance estimations. In particular, it has proved to be
        difficult to embed the triangular inequalities found in
        Internet path distances <a class='info' href='#Ledlie'>[Ledlie]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ledlie, J., Gardner, P., and M. Seltzer, &ldquo;Network Coordinates in the Wild,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.  Thus,
        <a class='info' href='#Wong'>Meridian<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wong, B., Slivkins, A., and E. Sirer, &ldquo;Meridian: A lightweight network location service without virtual coordinates,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [Wong] abandons the generality
        of network coordinate systems and provides specific distance
        evaluation services.  In Meridian, each node keeps track of
        small fixed number of neighbors and organizes them in
        concentric rings, ordered by distance from the node.  Meridian
        locates the closest node by performing a multi-hop search
        where each hop exponentially reduces the distance to the
        target.  Although less general than virtual coordinates,
        Meridian incurs significantly less error for closest node
        discovery.

        The <a class='info' href='#Ono'>Ono project<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Northwestern University Ono Project,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [Ono] takes a different

<p>
        <a class='info' href='#comptab'>Table&nbsp;1</a> summarizes the application-level
        topology estimation techniques. The salient performance metric
        is the relative error. While all approaches define this metric
        a bit differently, it can be generalized as how close a
        predicted distance comes to the corresponding measured
        distance. A value of zero implies perfect prediction and a
        value of 1 implies that the predicted distance is in error by
        a factor of two.  PIC, Vivaldi, and Meridian compare their
        results with that of GNP, while GNP itself compares its
        results with a precursor technique, IDMaps. Because each of
        the techniques uses a different Internet topology and a
        varying number of landmarks and dimensions to interpret the
        data set, it is impossible to normalize the relative error
        across all techniques uniformly.  Thus we present the relative
        error data in pairs, as reported in the literature describing
        the specific technique. Readers are urged to compare the
        relative error performance in each column on its own and not
        draw any conclusions by comparing the data across columns.
      
</p>
<p>
        Most of the work on estimating topology information focuses on
        predicting network distance in terms of latency and does not
        provide estimates for other metrics such as throughput or
        packet loss rate.  However, for many P2P applications latency
        is not the most important performance metric and these
        applications could benefit from a richer information plane.
        Sophisticated methods of active network probing and passive
        traffic monitoring are generally very powerful and can
        generate network statistics indirectly related to performance
        measures of interest, such as delay and loss rate on
        link-level granularity.  Extraction of these hidden attributes
        can be achieved by applying statistical inference techniques
        developed in the field of inferential network monitoring or
        network tomography subsequent to sampling of the network
        state. Thus, network tomography enables the extraction of a
        richer set of topology information, but at the same time
        inherently increasing complexity of a potential information
        plane and introducing estimation errors.  For both active and
        passive methods statistical models for the measurement
        process need to be developed and the spatial and temporal
        dependence of the measurements should be assessed.  Moreover,
        measurement methodology and statistical inference strategy
        must be considered jointly.  For a deeper discussion of
        network tomography and recent developments in the field we
        refer the reader to <a class='info' href='#Coates'>[Coates]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Coates, M., Hero, A., Nowak, R., and B. Yu, &ldquo;Internet Tomography,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.

        annotated atlas of the Internet that contains information
        about latency, bandwidth, capacity and loss rate.  To
        determine features of the Internet topology, iPlane bridges
        and builds upon different ideas, such as active probing based
        on packet dispersion techniques to infer available bandwidth
        along path segments.  These ideas are drawn from different
        fields, including network measurement as described by Dovrolis

Topology Estimation through Layer Cooperation</h3>

<p>
        Instead of estimating topology information on the application
        level through distributed measurements, this information could
        be provided by the entities running the physical networks --
        usually ISPs or network operators.  In fact, they have full
        knowledge of the topology of the networks they administer and,
        in order to avoid congestion on critical links, are interested
        in helping applications to optimize the traffic they generate.
        The remainder of this section briefly describes three recently
        proposed solutions that follow such an approach to address the
        ALTO problem.

P4P Architecture</h3>

<p>
          The architecture proposed by Xie et al. <a class='info' href='#Xie'>[Xie]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Xie, H., Yang, Y., Krishnamurthy, A., Liu, Y., and A. Silberschatz, &ldquo;P4P: Explicit Communications for Cooperative Control Between P2P and Network Providers,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>
          has been adopted by the DCIA P4P working group <a class='info' href='#P4P'>[P4P]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;DCIA P4P Working group,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, an open group established by ISPs, P2P
          software distributors and technology researchers with the
          dual goal of defining mechanisms to accelerate content
          distribution and optimize utilization of network resources.
        
</p>
<p>
          The main role in the P4P architecture is played by servers
          called "iTrackers", deployed by network providers and
          accessed by P2P applications (or, in general, by elements of
          the P2P system) in order to make optimal decisions when
          selecting a peer to connect.  An iTracker may offer three
          interfaces:

              Policy: Allows P2P elements to obtain policies and

<p>
          In the general solution proposed by Aggarwal et al. <a class='info' href='#Aggarwal'>[Aggarwal]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, V., Feldmann, A., and C. Scheidler, &ldquo;Can ISPs and P2P systems co-operate for improved performance?,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, network providers host servers,
          called "oracles", that help P2P users choose optimal
          neighbours.
        
</p>
<p>
          The oracle concept uses the following mechanism: a P2P
          client sends the list of potential peers to the oracle
          hosted by its ISP and receives a re-arranged peer list,
          ordered according to the ISP's local routing policies and
          preferences.  For instance, to keep the traffic local, the
          ISP may prefer peers within its network, or it may pick
          links with higher bandwidth or peers that are geographically
          closer to improve application performance.  Once the client
          has obtained this ordered list, it has enough information to
          perform better-than-random initial peer selection.
        
</p>
<p>
          Such a solution has been evaluated with simulations and
          experiments run on the PlanetLab testbed and the results
          show both improvements in content download time and a
          reduction of overall P2P traffic, even when only a subset of
          the applications actually query the oracle to make their
          decisions.

          (which are common in IPv6 networking). Peer selection
          optimization in P2P systems -- the ALTO problem in today's

Application-Level Topology Estimation and the ALTO Problem</h3>

<p>
      The application-level techniques described in Section <a class='info' href='#app-level'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Application-Level Topology Estimation</span><span>)</span></a> provide tools for peer-to-peer applications
      to estimate parameters of the underlying network
      topology. Although these techniques can improve application
      performance, there are limitations of what can be achieved by
      operating only on the application level. 
    
</p>
<p>
      Topology estimation techniques use abstractions of the network
      topology which often hide features that would be of interest to
      the application. Network coordinate systems, for example, are
      unable to detect overlay paths shorter than the direct path in
      the Internet topology. However, these paths frequently exist in
      the Internet <a class='info' href='#Wang'>[Wang]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wang, G., Zhang, B., and T. Ng, &ldquo;Towards Network Triangle Inequality Violation Aware Distributed Systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Similarly,
      application-level techniques may not accurately estimate
      topologies with multipath routing.
    
</p>
<p>
      When using network coordinates to estimate topology information
      the underlying assumption is that distance in terms of latency
      determines performance. However, for file sharing and content
      distribution applications there is more to performance than just
      the network latency between nodes. The utility of a long-lived
      data transfer is determined by the throughput of the underlying
      TCP protocol, which depends on the round-trip time as well as
      the loss rate experienced on the corresponding path <a class='info' href='#Padhye'>[Padhye]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Padhye, J., Firoiu, V., Towsley, D., and J. Kurose, &ldquo;Modeling TCP throughput: A simple model and its empirical validation,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Hence, these applications benefit from a
      richer set of topology information that goes beyond latency
      including loss rate, capacity and available bandwidth.
    
</p>
<p>
      Some of the topology estimation techniques used by P2P
      applications need time to converge to a result. For example,
      current BitTorrent clients implement local, passive traffic
      measurements and a tit-for-tat bandwidth reciprocity mechanism
      to optimize peer selection at a local level. Peers eventually
      settle on a set of neighbors that maximizes their download rate
      but because peers cannot reason about the value of neighbors
      without actively exchanging data with them and the number of
      concurrent data transfers is limited (typically to 5-7),
      convergence is delayed and easily can be sub-optimal.
    
</p>
<p>
      Skype's P2P Voice over IP (VoIP) application chooses a relay
      node in cases where two peers are behind NATs and cannot connect
      directly. Ren et al. <a class='info' href='#Ren'>[Ren]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ren, S., Guo, L., and X. Zhang, &ldquo;ASAP: An AS-aware peer-relay protocol for high quality VoIP,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> measured that the
      relay selection mechanism of Skype is (1) not able to discover
      the best possible relay nodes in terms of minimum RTT, (2)
      requires a long setup and stabilization time which degrades the
      end user experience, and (3) is creating a non-negligible amount
      of overhead traffic due to probing a large number of nodes. They
      further showed that the quality of the relay paths could be
      improved when the underlying network Autonomous System (AS)
      topology is considered.
    
</p>
<p>
      Some features of the network topology are hard to infer through
      application-level techniques and it may not be possible to infer
      them at all. An example for such a feature are service provider
      policies and preferences such as the state and cost associated
      with interdomain peering and transit links.  Another example is
      the traffic engineering policy of a service provider, which may
      counteract the routing objective of the overlay network leading
      to a poor overall performance <a class='info' href='#Seetharaman'>[Seetharaman]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Seetharaman, S., Hilt, V., Hofmann, M., and M. Ammar, &ldquo;Preemptive Strategies to Improve Routing Performance of           Native and Overlay Layers,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
    
</p>
<p>
      Finally, application-level techniques often require applications
      to perform measurements on the topology. These measurements
      create traffic overhead, in particular, if measurements are
      performed individually by all applications interested in
      estimating topology.

Coordinate estimation or path latencies?</h3>

<p>
        Despite the many solutions that have been proposed for
        providing applications with topology information in a fully
        distributed manner, there is currently an ongoing debate in
        the research community whether such solutions should focus on
        estimating nodes' coordinates or path latencies.  Such a
        debate has recently been fed by studies showing that the
        triangle inequality on which coordinate systems are based is
        often proved false in the Internet <a class='info' href='#Ledlie'>[Ledlie]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ledlie, J., Gardner, P., and M. Seltzer, &ldquo;Network Coordinates in the Wild,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.

Malicious nodes</h3>

<p>
        Another open issue common in most distributed environments
        consisting of a large number of peers is the resistance
        against malicious nodes.  Security mechanisms to identify
        misbehavior are based on triangle inequality checks <a class='info' href='#Costa'>[Costa]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Costa, M., Castro, M., Rowstron, A., and P. Key, &ldquo;PIC: Practical Internet coordinates for distance estimation,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, which however tend to fail and thus return
        false positives in presence of measurement inaccuracies
        induced, for example, by traffic fluctuations that occur quite
        often in large networks <a class='info' href='#Ledlie'>[Ledlie]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ledlie, J., Gardner, P., and M. Seltzer, &ldquo;Network Coordinates in the Wild,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.  Beyond the
        issue of using triangle inequality checks, authoritatively
        authenticating the identity of an oracle, and preventing an
        oracle from attacks are also important.  Exploration of
        existing techniques -- such as <a class='info' href='#RFC5280'>Public

        Similarly, even in controlled architectures deployed by

        returned to applications is deliberately altered, for example,
        assigning higher priority to financially inexpensive links
        instead of neutrally applying proximity criteria.  What are
        the effects of such deliberate alterations if multiple peers
        collude to determine a different route to the target, one that
        is not provided by an oracle?  Similarly, what are the
        consequences if an oracle targets a particular node in another
        AS by redirecting an inordinate number of querying peers to it
        causing, essentially, a <a class='info' href='#RFC4732'>Distributed

        Furthermore, does an oracle broadcast or multicast a response
        to a query?  If so, techniques to protect the confidentiality
        of the multi-cast stream will need to be investigated to
        thwart "free riding" peers.

Richness of topological information</h3>

<p>
        Many systems already use RTT to account for delay when
        establishing connections with peers (e.g., <a class='info' href='#Ratnasamy'>CAN<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ratnasamy, S., Francis, P., Handley, M., Karp, R., and S.

        only the delay metric but other metrics that the peer cannot
        figure out on its own.  These metrics may include the
        characteristics of the access links to other peers, bandwidth
        available to peers (based on operator's engineering of its
        network), network policies, and preferences such as state and
        cost associated with intradomain peering links, and so on.
        Exactly what kinds of metrics can an operator provide to
        stabilize the network throughput will also need to be

Hybrid solutions</h3>

<p>
        It is conceivable that P2P users may not be comfortable with
        operator intervention to provide topology information.  To
        eliminate this intervention, alternative schemes to estimate
        topological distance can be used. For instance, Ono uses
        client redirections generated by Akamai CDN servers as an
        approximation for estimating distance to peers; Vivaldi, GNP
        and PIC use synthetic coordinate systems.  A neutral
        third-party can make available a hybrid layer cooperation
        service -- without the active participation of the ISP -- that
        uses alternative techniques discussed in <a class='info' href='#app-level'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Application-Level Topology Estimation</span><span>)</span></a> to create a topological map.  This map

Negative impact of over-localization</h3>

<p>
        The literature presented in <a class='info' href='#survey'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Survey of Existing Literature</span><span>)</span></a> shows that
        a certain level of locality-awareness in the peer selection
        process of P2P algorithms is usually beneficial to the
        application performance.  However, an excessive localization
        of the traffic might cause partitioning in the overlay
        interconnecting peers, which will negatively affect the
        performance experienced by the peers themselves.
      
</p>
<p>
        Finding the right balance between localization and randomness
        in peer selection is an open issue. At the time of writing, it
        seems that different applications have different levels of
        tolerance and should be addressed separately.  Le Blond et

        partitioning in the overlay, yet reaching a high level of
        cross-domain traffic reduction without adversely impacting
