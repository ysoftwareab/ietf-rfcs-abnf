Abstract

   This draft introduces a different mode for the mobility usage in IP
   networks. This mode does not modify the Mobile IP protocol
   specifications [2] but makes their use more dynamic according to the
   movements of the mobile node as far as its communications are concerned.

   The Mobile IP mechanisms will be used only for the ongoing
   communications while the mobile node is in motion. That is, the Mobile
   IP mechanisms will be used for the communications established from an IP
   sub-network and which continue when the mobile node moves to another IP
   sub-network. For all the communications that are opened and closed in
   the same IP sub-network there is no need to use Mobile IP mechanisms
   even if the mobile node is away from its home network.

INTERNET DRAFT                                                  January, 2001


1. Introduction

   This draft aims at defining a different mode for the mobility usage in
   IP networks. This mode does not modify the Mobile IP protocol
   specifications [2] but makes their use more dynamic according to the
   movements of the mobile node as far as its communications are concerned.
   Indeed, the purpose of this draft is to address the following issues:

   (1) When a mobile node is on a visited network, is it necessary to use
       the Mobile IP mechanisms to open a communication with a new
       correspondent node (CN)?

   (2) When a new correspondent node opens a communication with a mobile
       node which is outside its home network is it necessary to use the
       Mobile IP mechanisms?

   In case (1) it is certainly more effective to open the communication
   with the new correspondent node directly by using the Care-of-Address as
   a source address and classical IPv6 forwarding and routing mechanisms
   without using the Mobile IP mechanisms, thus avoiding exchanges of
   Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement messages, and with no use of the
   Home Address and Routing Header options for exchanging data.

   In case (2) it is certainly more effective to indicate to the new
   correspondent node the Care-of-Address of the mobile node so that it can
   open the communication directly with this address using classical IPv6
   forwarding and routing mechanisms without using the Mobile IP
   mechanisms, thus avoiding exchanges of Binding Update/Binding
   Acknowledgement messages, and with no use of the Home Address and
   Routing Header options for exchanging data.

   The Mobile IP mechanisms will be used only for the ongoing
   communications while the mobile node is in motion between different IP
   sub-networks. That is, the Mobile IP mechanisms will be used for the
   communications established from an IP sub-network and which continue
   when the mobile node moves to another IP sub-network.

   For all the communications that are opened and closed in the same IP
   sub-network there is no need to use Mobile IP mechanisms even if the
   mobile node is away from home. Within this specific context, it is expected
   that this proposal makes theconnection establishment time better, while the
   volume of control messages should be dramatically reduced, .

   This draft deals especially with Mobile IPv6 but the mode specified here
   is also applicable in the case of Mobile IPv4 [3].

INTERNET DRAFT                                                  January, 2001


2. Motivation

   Within the context of a wide deployment of IP mobility services (telephony,
   videoconferencing, interactivity...) it is assumed that the majority
   of the communications will take place without mobility at the IP level
   (Fig. 1) i.e. without changing the IP sub-network when moving. It is
   also very likely that the majority of the communications open and close
   while the mobile node keeps being connected to the same IP sub-network.
   It does not mean that the mobile node does not move during its
   communications. The mobile node can move inside a zone of radio cells
   without connecting/re-connecting to different IP sub-networks and therefore,
   without changing the IP address. In such cases the mobile node does not need
   to use the Mobile IP mechanisms.

   The Mobile IP mechanisms will be used only for the communications
   established from an IP sub-network and which will be kept opened while
   the mobile node moves to another IP sub-network.

   This mobility management mode reduces the connection establishment times
   and in many cases it reduces the number of control messages exchanged
   between the mobile node and its correspondent nodes. The Mobile IP
   mechanisms will be used only when they are necessary to maintain the
   communications opened between the mobile node and its correspondents
   while it moves between various IP sub-networks.

3. Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms in addition to those
   defined in the draft "Mobility support in IPv6" [2]:

   Permanent home sub-network: home link in the Mobile IP terminology. This
   is the IP sub-network on which a mobile node's permanent home address is
   defined.

   Permanent home address: home address in the Mobile IP terminology. This
   is the IP address that allows each correspondent node to contact the
   mobile node without having to know its current location.

   Permanent home agent: home agent in the Mobile IP terminology. This is
   the mobility agent on the permanent home sub-network. It acts as a home
   agent for the communications opened from the permanent home sub-network
   and which continue when the mobile node moves to another IP sub-network.

   Temporary home sub-network: a foreign link (in the Mobile IP
   terminology) from which a mobile node has opened a communication with an
   additional correspondent node.

   Temporary home address: a Care-of-Address (in the Mobile IP terminology)
   that is associated to a mobile on the temporary home sub-network. The
   mobile node uses this address as its source address to directly open a
   connection with an additional correspondent node without using Mobile
   IP mechanisms.

   Temporary home agent: a mobility agent on the foreign link from which
   the mobile node has opened connections with additional
   correspondent nodes. Temporary home agent acts as a home agent for these
   connections, until they close, when the mobile node moves to another
   IP sub-network.

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [1].


4. Overview

   When a mobile node is connected to a given IP sub-network it establishes
   connections with additional correspondent nodes by using the IP address
   obtained in the IP sub-network to which it is attached. Two situations
   can occur:






Kassi-Lahlou, Jacquenet                                               [Page 5]


INTERNET DRAFT                                                  January, 2001


   - The communication ends while the mobile node is still connected to the
     same IP sub-network. In this case it does not have to use the Mobile
     IP mechanisms.

   - The communication continues while the mobile node moves and changes
     from the IP sub-network to another. In this case, to maintain the
     communication opened, it has to use the Mobile IP mechanisms.


5. Operation

5.1. Initial phase

   In this initial phase, the mobile node is connected to the permanent
   home sub-network, gets its permanent home address and the address of its
   permanent home agent. Note that the mobile node can just be configured
   with all the above-mentioned parameters without being connected to its
   permanent home sub-network.

5.2. Connection phase

   When the mobile node connects to a physical sub-network (wired or
   wireless), it can be on its permanent home sub-network or on a temporary
   home sub-network.

5.2.1. Connecting to the permanent sub-home network

   In this case the mobile node discovers that it is connected to its
   permanent home sub-network and it discovers its permanent home agent.

   As long as it remains connected to its permanent home sub-network and
   for all the communications that have been opened with additional
   correspondent nodes, it uses classical IPv6 forwarding and routing
   mechanisms without using the Mobile IP mechanisms.

5.2.2 Connecting to a temporary home sub-network

   In this case the mobile node discovers that it is connected to a foreign
   sub-network and it discovers a mobility agent on this sub-network. The
   MN gets a Care-of-Address and sends a "Binding Update" message to its
   permanent home agent. To send Binding Update messages, it uses Mobile IP
   mechanisms.









Kassi-Lahlou, Jacquenet                                               [Page 6]


INTERNET DRAFT                                                  January, 2001


   As long as the MN remains connected to this foreign sub-network, it
   opens all the IP communications with additional correspondent nodes by
   using the Care-of-Address as its source address, and it uses classical
   IP forwarding and routing mechanisms without using the Mobile IP
   mechanisms. In this case, the foreign sub-network, the mobility agent on
   this sub-network and the Care-of-	Address are respectively called
   temporary home sub-network, temporary home agent and temporary home
   address.

   In both previous cases (5.2.1, 5.2.2), the mobile node opens all the 
   connections with additional correspondent nodes by using the address
   obtained in the sub-network it is attached to as the source address. For
   a given communication, two situations can occur:

   a) The communication ends while the mobile node remains connected to
      the same IP sub-network, then it does not need to use the Mobile IP
      mechanisms.

   b) The communication continues while the mobile node gets connected to a
      different IP sub-network, then it becomes necessary to use the Mobile
      IP mechanisms.

5.3. Mobility phase

   When a mobile node moves from a sub-network (home or foreign) towards
   another sub-network (home or foreign):

     1) It discovers its movement and the change of the IP sub-network,

     2) It discovers a home agent (new, permanent or the still active previous
        temporary one) of the IP sub-network it has just connected to,

     3) It gets an address (new, permanent or the still active previous
        temporary one) with the prefix of the IP sub-network it has just 
        connected to,

     4) It exchanges Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement messages with its
        permanent home agent.

   A) For a correspondent node with whom an ongoing communication has been
      established before the arrival on this IP sub-network, a mobile node
      uses Mobile IP mechanisms to maintain this communication opened. The
      use of Mobile IP consists among others in:








Kassi-Lahlou, Jacquenet                                               [Page 7]


INTERNET DRAFT                                                  January, 2001


     a) Exchanging Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement messages with
        the temporary home agent of the IP sub-network from which this
        communication was opened (if it is different from the permanent home
        agent),

     b) Exchanging Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement messages with a
        home agent on the link where the previous care-of-address is
        located so as to forward packets from the previous care-of
        address, in the case where the above-mentioned home agent it is 
        different from the permanent home agent and the above temporary one,

     c) Exchanging Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement messages with
        the correspondent node himself

     d) Using the Home Address and Routing Header options to exchange
        packets with this correspondent

   B) For the communications with new correspondents, a mobile node does
        not use the Mobile IP mechanisms:

     a) It establishes a communication with them by using the classical IP
        forwarding and routing mechanisms instead,

     b) It uses the address acquired in the IP sub-network it is attached
        to, as the source address.

5.4. Input connections

   When a correspondent node that has no information about the location of
   a mobile node opens a communication with this MN, it uses the permanent
   home address of the mobile node as the destination address. Therefore,
   packets are forwarded towards the permanent home network of the mobile
   node. Two cases can be considered:

   - The mobile node is indeed connected to its permanent home network: in
     this case, packets are directly forwarded towards the mobile node
     which in turn answers directly to the correspondent node. Obviously,
     the communication does not make use of Mobile IP mechanisms, but uses
     classical IP forwarding and routing mechanisms instead.

   - The mobile node is connected to a temporary home network: in this case
     packets are intercepted by the permanent home agent and tunnelled
     towards the mobile node location. When the mobile node receives such
     packets it sends Binding Update messages to the correspondent node so
     as to establish a direct communication with the CN, thanks to the use
     of the Mobile IP mechanisms.





Kassi-Lahlou, Jacquenet                                               [Page 8]


INTERNET DRAFT                                                  January, 2001


    For the second case, where the mobile node is connected to a temporary
    home sub-network, another way of managing these input calls can be
    proposed:

   - Upon reception of the first packet, the mobile node sends a message to
     the correspondent node to notify that it refuses the communication by
     using its permanent home address, and asks the correspondent node to
     communicate directly by using its temporary home address as the
     destination address, so as to avoid the use of the Mobile IP
     mechanisms. This notification is processed by the upper layers.
     The notification message is not directly sent to the correspondent
     node so as to avoid the use of Binding Update messages. The message is
     tunnelled back to the permanent home agent which transmits the tunnelled
     packet to the correspondent node. Furthermore, this procedure allows
     the mobile node to negotiate with the correspondent node a new
     security association which will be indexed on the temporary home address.


6. Scalability Considerations

   One identified issue when using this mechanism is that the mobile node
   should maintain information concerning the temporary home agent of the
   network from which an ongoing communication was established. We assume
   that this additional information does not dramatically increase the
   amount of information being maintained by the mobile node concerning its
   communications. Indeed, for every correspondent node with whom a
   communication is in progress while the mobile node is moving, an entry
   is maintained by the MN in its mobility cache.

   On the other hand, the number of entries in the mobility cache will
   decrease because only those correspondent nodes with whom the
   communications will be kept opened while the mobile node is moving
   between various IP sub-networks, have one entry in this cache.

   For example, when a mobile node leaves its permanent home network and
   connects to a temporary network, and it has established no communication
   before it connects to the temporary network. It opens a communication
   with a new correspondent node, and this communication ends before the
   mobile node connects to another point of attachment in the IP sub-network.
   For this communication:

   If the mobile node uses the Mobile IP mechanisms it implies:









Kassi-Lahlou, Jacquenet                                               [Page 9]


INTERNET DRAFT                                                  January, 2001


   - The creation of an entry in the mobile node mobility cache as well as
     in the correspondent node mobility cache,

   - The exchange of Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement messages and

   - The use of the Home Address and Routing Header options for the
     exchanges of packets.

   If the mobile node has established the communication without using
   Mobile IP mechanisms and by using its temporary home address as source
   address, the procedures are dramatically simplified.

Example:

   For the mobile services being deployed over large wireless networks, the
   interest of this mobility management facility is going to depend:

   - On the range of the wireless areas that actually correspond to an IP
     sub-network

   - On the duration of the communication when the mobile node is in motion

   This mode consists in using the Mobile IP mechanisms only for the
   communications which continue after a change of the point of attachment
   in the IP network, and it is more efficient for the IP mobility
   management in the case of large networks, especially when the number of
   the communications that comprise a change of the point of attachment in
   the IP network remains relatively low, compared to the global number of
   communications which are opened and closed inside a single IP sub-network.


7. Security Considerations

   This mode does not introduce any additional security issue compared to the
   current Mobile IP specifications. When the mobile node uses Mobile IP
   mechanisms, the security requirements are the same as for mobile IP
   specifications and when it does not use these mechanisms the security
   requirements are the same as for classical IP forwarding and routing
   specifications.
