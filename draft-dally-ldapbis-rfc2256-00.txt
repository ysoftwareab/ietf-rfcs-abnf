    A Summary of the X.500(3rd edition) User Schema for use with LDAPv3
                  draft-dally-ldapbis-rfc2256-00.txt 

   [Editor's note:  This Internet-Draft (I-D) contains changes to the 
   text of RFC 2256, in order to bring it up to date.  This action is 
   part of the maintenance activity that is needed in order to progress 
   LDAPv3 to Draft Standard.  The changes are:

      * Revision of the Status of this Memo.

      * Dependencies on RFC 1274 have been eliminated.

      * The references to X.500(96) have been expressed in terms of the 
        "edition", rather than the standard date.  Note that the version
        of X.500 which is the basis for this document, is the third 
        edition, which was finalized in 1996, but approved in 1997.

      * The "teletexTerminalNumber" attribute and syntax are marked 
        as obsolete.

      * Removed "The syntax definitions are based on the ISODE "QUIPU" 
        implementation of X.500." from section 6.

      * Added text to 6.1, the octetString syntax, in accordance 
        with X.520.

      * Some of the attribute types MUST be recognized by servers.  
        Also, several attributes are obsolete.  Therefore, the various 
        kinds of attribute types have been placed in separate sections:

           - necessary for the directory to operate (section 3.1) 

           - for holding user information (section 3.2) 

           - obsolete (section 3.3).  

      * Since "top" may be implicitly specified and  "alias" is not 
        abstract, the last sentence in the description of the 
        "objectClass" attribute type, section 3.1.1, has been deleted.
        The clause that preceded the deleted sentence has been 
        removed, also.

      * Add a description to the definition of the "telephoneNumber" 
        attribute type, section 3.2.17.

      * Add text to mark the "teletexTerminalIdentifier" attribute type 
        as obsolete.

      * Add a security consideration requiring strong authentication in 
        order to modify directory entries.

   One task that has not been completed is augmentation of the 
   descriptions of some attribute types.

Abstract

   This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object
   classes defined by the ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T committees in the 
   IS0/IEC 9594 and  X.500 documents, in particular those intended for 
   use by directory clients.  This is the most widely used schema for 
   LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema definitions for white 
   pages objects use it as a basis.  This document does not cover 
   attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, 
   nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.

   The name attribute type is the attribute supertype from which string
   attribute types typically used for naming may be formed.  It is
   unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an entry. LDAP
   server implementations which do not support attribute subtyping need
   not recognize this attribute in requests.   Client implementations
   MUST NOT assume that LDAP servers are capable of performing attribute
   subtyping.

3.2.41 x500UniqueIdentifier

   The x500UniqueIdentifier attribute is used to distinguish between
   objects when a distinguished name has been reused.  This is a
   different attribute type from both the "uid" and "uniqueIdentifier"
   types.

3.2.42 dnQualifier

   The dnQualifier attribute type specifies disambiguating information
   to add to the relative distinguished name of an entry.  It is
   intended for use when merging data from multiple sources in order to
   prevent conflicts between entries which would otherwise have the same
   name. It is recommended that the value of the dnQualifier attribute
   be the same for all entries from a particular source.

3.2.45 distinguishedName

   This attribute type is not used as the name of the object itself, but
   it is instead a base type from which attributes with DN syntax
   inherit.

   It is unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an

4.  Syntaxes

   Servers SHOULD recognize the syntaxes defined in this section.  Each
   syntax begins with a sample value of the ldapSyntaxes attribute which
   defines the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the syntax.  The descriptions of
   syntax names are not carried in protocol, and are not guaranteed to
   be unique.

4.1  Delivery Method

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.14 DESC 'Delivery Method' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      delivery-value = pdm / ( pdm whsp "$" whsp delivery-value )

      pdm = "any" / "mhs" / "physical" / "telex" / "teletex" /
                "g3fax" / "g4fax" / "ia5" / "videotex" / "telephone"

   Example:

      telephone

4.2  Enhanced Guide

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.21 DESC 'Enhanced Guide' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      EnhancedGuide = woid whsp "#" whsp criteria whsp "#" whsp subset

      subset = "baseobject" / "oneLevel" / "wholeSubtree"


   The criteria production is defined in the Guide syntax below.  This
   syntax has been added subsequent to RFC 1778.

   Example:

      person#(sn)#oneLevel

4.3  Guide

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.25 DESC 'Guide' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      guide-value = [ object-class "#" ] criteria

      object-class = woid

      criteria = criteria-item / criteria-set / ( "!" criteria )

      criteria-set = ( [ "(" ] criteria "&" criteria-set [ ")" ] ) /
                     ( [ "(" ] criteria "|" criteria-set [ ")" ] )

      criteria-item = [ "(" ] attributetype "$" match-type [ ")" ]

      match-type = "EQ" / "SUBSTR" / "GE" / "LE" / "APPROX"

   This syntax should not be used for defining new attributes.

4.4  Octet String

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 DESC 'Octet String' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded as octet strings.


   Example:

      secret

4.5  Teletex Terminal Identifier

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.51 DESC 'Teletex Terminal Identifier' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      teletex-id = ttx-term  0*("$" ttx-param)

      ttx-term   = printablestring

      ttx-param  = ttx-key ":" ttx-value

      ttx-key    = "graphic" / "control" / "misc" / "page" / "private"

      ttx-value  = octetstring

   In the above, the first printablestring is the encoding of the first
   portion of the teletex terminal identifier to be encoded, and the
   subsequent 0 or more octetstrings are subsequent portions of the
   teletex terminal identifier.

4.6  Telex Number

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.52 DESC 'Telex Number' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      telex-number  = actual-number "$" country "$" answerback

      actual-number = printablestring

      country       = printablestring

      answerback    = printablestring

   In the above, actual-number is the syntactic representation of the
   number portion of the TELEX number being encoded, country is the
   TELEX country code, and answerback is the answerback code of a TELEX
   terminal.

4.7  Supported Algorithm

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.49 DESC 'Supported Algorithm' )

   No printable representation of values of the supportedAlgorithms
   attribute is defined in this document.  Clients which wish to store
   and retrieve this attribute MUST use "supportedAlgorithms;binary", in
   which the value is transferred as a binary encoding.

6.  Matching Rules

   Servers MAY implement additional matching rules.

6.1  octetStringMatch

   Servers which implement the extensibleMatch filter SHOULD allow the
   matching rule listed in this section to be used in the
   extensibleMatch.  In general these servers SHOULD allow matching
   rules to be used with all attribute types known to the server, when
   the assertion syntax of the matching rule is the same as the value
   syntax of the attribute.

   The Octet String Match rule compares for equality an asserted octet 
   string with an attribute value of type OCTET STRING.

   The strings match if they are the same length and corresponding 
   octets are identical.

   ( 2.5.13.17 NAME 'octetStringMatch'
    SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )


7.  Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

   It is required that strong authentication be performed in order to 
   modify directory entries using LDAP.

8.  Acknowledgements

   The definitions, on which this document is based, have been developed
   by committees for telecommunications and international standards.  
   No new attribute definitions have been added.
