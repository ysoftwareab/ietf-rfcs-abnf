INTERNET DRAFT     OSPF Graceful Restart Enhancements       July 7, 2019


1  Introduction

   This document describes the enhancements to the current Graceful
   restart OSPF procedure to improve routing convergence in certain OSPF
   network deployment scenarios. The goal is for both the restarting
   OSPF node and the helper OSPF node to terminate the OSPF graceful
   restart procedure faster and not wait for the grace period expiry in
   those network scenarios and hence improve the overall OSPF network
   convergence.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Graceful Restart Enhancements

   In this section we will describe couple of issues with OSPF Graceful
   Restart (GR) in some network deployment scenarios, and a proposal to
   enhance the OSPF GR procedure to achieve faster OSPF routing
   convergence in those scenarios.

2.1 Stub Link Network Scenarios


   ---------             ---------            ---------
   |Router1|---Area 0----|Router2|---Area 1---|Router3|
   ---------             ---------            ---------

           Figure1: OSPF topology with Graceful restart


   As described in figure 1, Router2 is an area border router (ABR) with
   OSPF links in 2 areas. Furthermore. Router2 has formed full
   adjacencies only in Area 0. In Area 1, Router2 has an OSPF link
   enabled but Router2 couldn't form any adjacency either because
   Router3 is down or Router3 does not have OSPF enabled. Hence, Router2
   will only have a stub link in Area 1.

   On restart, the ABR router Router2, having only a stub link in the
   Area 1, will never receive its pre-restart LSA in this area and will
   never form an adjacency, Router2 will have to wait for the grace
   period expiry leading to slower OSPF routing convergence.

   For this we propose, if no OSPF control packets were received within

   the dead interval on a link in Area 1 as per the above network
   scenario, Router2 MUST mark the link as stub and MUST not wait for
   the grace period to form an adjacency on this link to successfully
   Exit GR.

2.2 Multiple Failure Scenarios

   In scenarios where more than one router is restarting at the same
   time in the same OSPF area and StrictLSAChecking is disabled,
   restarting OSPF routers will end up waiting the entire grace interval
   to exit GR. 

   If the restarting routers receive a Grace Link State Advertisements
   (LSA) from another router in a given area after restart, and the
   helper routers receive grace LSAs from more than one router, this
   will indicate that there have been multiple failures. Therefore, the
   helper and restarting routers MUST terminate GR and avoid any
   unnecessary delay in OSPF routing convergence.

3  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security constraints.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None
