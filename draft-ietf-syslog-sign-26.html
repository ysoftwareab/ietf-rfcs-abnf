Introduction</h3>

<p>
			This document describes a mechanism, called syslog-sign in this document,
			that adds origin
			authentication, message integrity, replay resistance, message
			sequencing, and detection of missing messages to syslog.  Essentially,
			this is accomplished by sending a special syslog message.  
			The contents of this syslog message is called a Signature Block.  
			Each Signature Block contains, in effect, a detached signature on
			some number of previously sent messages.  It is cryptographically signed and contains 
			the hashes of previously sent syslog messages.  
			
</p>
<p>
			While most implementations
			of syslog involve only a single originator
			and a single collector of each message,
			provisions need to be made to cover situations in which messages are 
			sent to multiple collectors.  
			This concerns, in particular, situations in which different messages 
			from the same originator are sent to different collectors, 
			which means that some messages are sent 
			to some collectors but not to others.  
			The required differentiation of messages is generally performed 
			based on the Priority value of the individual messages.  
			For example, messages from any Facility
			with a Severity value of 3, 2, 1, or 0 may be sent to one collector
			while all messages of Facilities 4, 10, 13, and 14 may be sent to
			another collector.  Appropriate syslog-sign messages must be kept
			with their proper syslog messages.  To address this, syslog-sign
			uses a Signature Group.  A Signature Group identifies a group of
			messages that are all kept together for signing purposes by the
			originator.  A Signature Block always belongs to exactly one Signature
			Group and always signs messages belonging only to that Signature
			Group.
			
</p>
<p>
			Additionally, an originator sends a Certificate Block to provide key
			management information between the originator and the collector.  This
			Certificate Block has a field to denote the type of key material
			which may be such things as a PKIX certificate, an OpenPGP certificate,
			or even an indication that a key had been pre-distributed.  
			In the cases of certificates being sent, the
			certificates may have to be split across multiple packets.
			
</p>
<p>
			It is possible that the same host contains multiple originators that
			each use their own keys to sign syslog messages.  In this case,
			each originator sends its own Certificate Block and Signature
			Blocks.  Furthermore, each originator defines its own 
			Signature Groups.  Each originator on a given host needs to use a a distinct 
			combination of APP-NAME and PROCID for its 
			Signature Block and Certificate Block message.     
			(This implies that, provided the originators include in their messages 
			a HOSTNAME that uniquely identifies a host, not a NILVALUE, 
			the combination of HOSTNAME, APP-NAME and PROCID 
			uniquely distinguishes originators of syslog-sign messages across hosts.)  
			
</p>
<p>
			The collector of the previous messages may verify that the hash of 
			each received message matches the signed hash contained
			in the Signature Block.  A collector may process these Signature
			Blocks as they arrive, building an authenticated log file.
			Alternatively, it may store all the log messages in the order they
			were received.  This allows a network operator to authenticate the
			log file at the time the logs are reviewed.
			
</p>
<p>
			The mechanism described in this specification is intended to be used in
			conjunction with  
			the syslog protocol as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>
			as its message delivery mechanism and uses the concept of 
			STRUCTURED-DATA elements defined
			in that document.  In fact, this specification mandates implementation of 
			syslog protocol.  Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the concepts 
			underlying this mechanism could 
			also be used in conjunction with other message delivery mechanisms.  
			Designers of other efforts to define event notification mechanisms are 
			therefore encouraged to consider this specification in their designs.

			The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",

syslog Message Format</h3>

<p>
			This specification is intended to be used in conjunction with the syslog 
			protocol as defined in
			<a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The syslog protocol therefore 
			MUST be supported by implementations of this specification.   
			
</p>
<p>
			Because the originator generating the 
			Signature Block message signs each message in its entirety, 
			the messages MUST NOT be changed in transit.  By the same token, 
			the syslog-sign messages MUST NOT be changed in transit.  
			<a class='info' href='#RFC3164'>[RFC3164]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lonvick, C., &ldquo;The BSD syslog Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> describes relay behavior in which syslog messages
			are altered.  If such behavior were to occur in conjunction with syslog-sign, 
			it would render any signing invalid and hence make the mechanism useless.   
			Likewise, any truncation of messages
			that occurs between sending and receiving renders the mechanism useless.  
			For this reason, syslog originator and collector implementations implementing this 
			specification MUST support messages of up to and including 2048 octets in length, 
			in order to minimize the chance of truncation.   
			While syslog originator and collector implementations MAY support messages with a 
			length larger than 2048 octets, implementers need to be aware that any message
			truncations that occur render the mechanism useless.  
			
</p>

			This specification uses the syslog message format
			described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.  
			Along with other fields, that document describes the concept of Structured Data (SD).  
			Structured Data is defined in terms of SD ELEMENTS (SDEs).  
			An SDE consists of a name and a set of parameter name - value pairs.  
			The SDE name is referred to as SD-ID.  
			The name-value pairs are referred to as SD-PARAM, or SD Parameters,
			with the name constituting the SD-PARAM-NAME, and the value constituting the SD-PARAM-VALUE.  
			
</p>
<p>
			The syslog messages defined in this document carry the signature and certificate data
			as Structured Data.  The special syslog messages defined in this document 
			include for this purpose definitions 
			of SDEs to convey parameters that relate to the signing of syslog messages.  
			The MSG part of the syslog messages defined in this document SHOULD 
			simply be empty -- 
			the content of the messages is not intended for interpretation by humans but by applications
			that use those messages to build an authenticated log.    
			
</p>
<p> 
			Because the syslog messages defined in this document adhere to the format 
			described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, they identify the machine that 
			originates the syslog message in the HOSTNAME field.  Therefore, the signature and certificate 
			data do not need to include any additional parameter to identify the machine that orginates the 
			message.   
			
</p>
<p>
			In addition, the same host MAY host several originators that each sign syslog messages 
			independently of each other, each using their own Signature Groups.  
			In the context of syslog-sign, different such originators on the same host
			are distinguished by the combination of APP-NAME and PROCID fields used in their messages, 
			hence the combination of APP-NAME and PROCID MUST be unique for an originator on a given host.  
			(This implies that, provided the message contains a HOSTNAME that uniquely identifies a host, not 
			a NILVALUE, the combination of HOSTNAME, APP-NAME and PROCID uniquely identifies an originator
			across hosts.)  
			A Signature Block message MUST use the same combination of HOSTNAME, APP-NAME, and PROC-ID 
			that was used to send the corresponding Certificate Block messages containing the 
			Payload Block.

syslog Messages Containing a Signature Block</h3>

<p>
				There is a need to distinguish the Signature Block itself from the syslog message
				that is used to carry a Signature Block.  
				Signature Blocks MUST be encompassed within completely formed 
				syslog messages.  Syslog messages that contain a Signature Block are also referred to as 
				Signature Block messages.  
				
</p>
<p>
				A Signature Block message 
				is identified by the presence of an
				SD ELEMENT with an SD-ID with the value "ssign".  
				In addition, a Signature Block message 
				MUST contain valid APP-NAME, PROCID, and MSGID fields to be compliant with 
				<a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.   
				This specification does not mandate particular values for these fields; however, 
				for consistency, an originator MUST use the 
				same values for APP-NAME, PROCID, and MSGID fields for 
				every Signature Block message that is sent, whichever values are chosen.  
				It MUST also use the same value for its HOSTNAME field.  
				To allow for the possibility of multiple originators per host, 
				the combination of APP-NAME and PROCID MUST be unique for each such originator on any 
				given host.  
				If an originator daemon is restarted, it MAY use a new PROCID for what is otherwise the 
				same originator but MUST continue to use the same APP-NAME.  
				If it uses a new PROCID, it MUST send a new Payload Block using Certificate Block messages
				that use the same new PROCID (and the same APP-NAME).      
				It is RECOMMENDED (but not required) to use 110 as value 
				for the PRI field, corresponding to facility 13 and severity 6 (informational).  
				The Signature Block is 
				carried as Structured Data within the Signature Block message, per the definitions 
				that follow in the next section.  
				A Signature Block 
				message MAY carry other Structured Data besides the Structured Data of the 
				Signature Block itself.  
				The MSG part of a Signature Block message SHOULD be empty.  
				
</p>
<p>
				The syslog messages defined as part of syslog-sign themselves 
				(Signature Block messages and Certificate Block messages) MUST NOT be
				signed by a Signature Block.  Collectors that 
				implement syslog-sign know to distinguish syslog messages that are associated with syslog-sign 
				from those that are subjected to signing and 
				process them differently.  The intent of syslog-sign is to sign a stream of syslog 
				messages, not to alter it.

Version</h3>

<p>
					The Version field is an alphanumeric value

					The first two octets and the last octet contain a 
					decimal character in the range of "0" to "9", whereas the third octet

					or "A" to "Z".  
					The value in this field specifies
					the version of the syslog-sign protocol. This is extensible to allow
					for different hash algorithms and signature schemes to be used in
					the future. The value of this field is the grouping of the protocol
					version (2 octets), the hash algorithm (1 octet) and the signature
					scheme (1 octet).  

					</p>
<blockquote class="text">

Reboot Session ID</h3>

<p>
					The Reboot Session ID is a decimal value that has a length between 1 and 10 octets.  
					The acceptable values for
					this are between 0 and 9999999999.  Leading zeroes MUST be omitted.  
					
</p>
<p>
					 A Reboot Session ID is expected to strictly monotonically increase 
					 (i.e., to never repeat or decrease) whenever an originator
					 reboots in order to allow collectors to distinguish messages and
					 message signatures across reboots.  There are several ways in which
					 this may be accomplished.  In one way, the Reboot Session ID may
					 increase by 1, starting with a value of 1.  Note that in this case, an
					 originator is required to retain the previous Reboot Session ID across
					 reboots.  In another way, a value of the unix time (number of seconds
					 since 1 January 1970) may be used.  Implementers of this
					 method need to beware of the possibility of multiple reboots 
					 occurring within a single second.  Implementers need to also beware   
					 of the year 2038 problem, which will cause the 32-bit representation of 
					 unix time to wrap in the year 2038.  In yet another way,
					 implementers wish to consider using the snmpEngineBoots value as a
					 source for this counter as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3414'>[RFC3414]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blumenthal, U. and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.  
					
</p>
<p> 
					In cases where an originator is not able to guarantee that the Reboot Session ID is always 
					increased after a reboot, the Reboot Session ID MUST always be set to a value of 0.   
					If the value can no longer be increased (e.g., because it reaches 9999999999), 
					then manual intervention may be required to subsequently reset it.  
					
</p>
<p>
					If a reboot of an originator takes place, Signature Block messages MAY use a new PROCID.  
					However, Signature Block messages of the same originator MUST continue to use the 
					same HOSTNAME, APP-NAME, and MSGID.

Signature Group and Signature Priority</h3>

<p>
					The SG parameter may take any value from
					0-3 inclusive.  The SPRI parameter may take any value from 0-191 inclusive.  
                    These fields
					taken together allow network administrators to associate
					groupings of syslog messages with appropriate Signature Blocks and
					Certificate Blocks.  
					Groupings of syslog messages that are signed together are also 
					called Signature Groups.  A Signature Block contains only hashes 
					of those syslog messages that are part of the same Signature Group.  
					
</p>
<p>
					For example, in some cases, network
					administrators might have originators send syslog messages of Facilities 0 through 15
					to one collector and those with Facilities 16
					through 23 to another.  In such cases, associated Signature Blocks should 
					likely be sent to the corresponding collectors as well, signing the syslog 
					messages that are intended for each collector separately.  This way, each
					collector receives Signature Blocks for all syslog messages
					that it receives, and only for those.  
					The ability to associate different categories of syslog messages with different 
					Signature Groups, signed in separate Signature Blocks, 
					provides administrators with flexibility in this regard.  
					
</p>
<p>
					Syslog-sign provides four options for handling Signature Groups,
					linking them with PRI values so they may be routed to the
					destination commensurate with the corresponding syslog messages. In
					all cases, no more than 192 distinct Signature Groups (0-191) are permitted.  
					
</p>
<p>
					The Signature Group to which a Signature Block pertains is indicated by 
					the Signature Priority (SPRI) field.  
					The Signature Group (SG) field indicates how to interpret the Signature 
					Priority field.  (Note that the SG field does not indicate the Signature Group itself, 
					as its name might suggest.)  The SG field can have one of the following values:  

					</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
						"0" -- There is only one Signature Group.  
						In this case, the administrators want all Signature
						Blocks to be sent to a single destination; in all likelihood,
						all of the syslog messages will also be going to that same
						destination.  Signature Blocks sign
						all messages regardless of their PRI value.  
						This means that, in effect,
						the Signature Block's SPRI value can be ignored.  
						However, it is RECOMMENDED that a single SPRI value be used for all
						Signature Blocks.    
						Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED to set that value 
						to the same value as the 
						PRI field of the Signature Block message.  This way, the PRI of the Signature
						Block message matches the SPRI of the Signature Block that it contains.
						
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
						"1" -- Each PRI value is associated with its own Signature Group. Signature
						Blocks for a given Signature Group have SPRI = PRI for that
						Signature Group.  In other words, the SPRI of the Signature Block matches 
						the PRI value of the syslog messages that are part of the Signature Group
						and hence signed by the Signature Block.  
						An SG value of 1 can, for example, be used when the administrator of an originator
						does not know where any of the syslog messages will ultimately
						go but anticipates that messages with different PRI values will be collected and 
						processed separately.  Having a Signature Group per PRI value provides 
						administrators with 
						a large degree of flexibility with regard to how to divide 
						up the processing of syslog messages and their signatures after they 
						are received, at the same time allowing 
						Signature Blocks to follow the corresponding syslog messages to their
						eventual destination.    
						
</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>
						"2" -- Each Signature Group contains a range of PRI values.
						Signature Groups are assigned sequentially. A Signature Block for
						a given Signature Group has its own SPRI value denoting the
						highest PRI value of syslog messages in that Signature Group.  
						The lowest PRI value of syslog messages in that Signature Group will
						be one larger than the SPRI value of the previous Signature Group or "0" 
						in case there is no other Signature Group with a lower SPRI value.  
						The specific Signature Groups and ranges they are associated with 
						are subject to configuration by a system administrator.  
						
</dd>
<dt>d.</dt>
<dd>
						"3" -- Signature Groups are not assigned with any of the above 
						relationships to PRI values of the syslog messages they 
						sign. Instead, another scheme is used, which is outside the scope of 
						this specification.  There has to be some predefined
						arrangement between the originator and the intended collectors as to which 
						syslog messages are to be included in which Signature Group, requiring 
						configuration by a system administrator.  This provides administrators also 
						with the flexibility to group syslog messages into Signature Groups according to 
						criteria that are not tied to the PRI value.  
						
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

					One reasonable way to configure some installations is to have only
					one Signature Group, indicated with SG=0, and have the originator send a copy of 
					each Signature Block to each collector.   In that case, collectors that are not 
					configured to receive every syslog message will still receive signatures for
					every message, even ones they are not supposed to receive.   
					While the collector will not be able to detect gaps in the
					messages (because the presence of a signature of a message that is missing 
					does not tell the collector whether
					or not the corresponding message would be of the collector's concern), 
					it does allow all messages that do arrive at each collector
					to be put into the right order and to be verified.  It also
					allows each collector to detect duplicates.  
					Likewise, configuring only one Signature Group can be a reasonable way to 
					configure installations that involve relay chains, 
					where one or more interim relays may or may not relay all messages to the 
					same destination.

Global Block Counter</h3>

<p>
					The Global Block Counter is a decimal value representing the number of
					Signature Blocks sent by syslog-sign before the current one, in this
					reboot session. This takes at least 1 octet and at most 10 octets
					displayed as a decimal counter. The acceptable values for this
					are between 0 and 9999999999, starting with 0.  Leading zeroes MUST be omitted.  
					If the value of the Global Block Counter 
					has reached 9999999999 and the Reboot Session ID has a value other than 0
					(indicating the fact that persistence of the Reboot Session ID is supported),
					then the Reboot Session ID MUST be incremented by 1 and the
					Global Block Counter resumes at 0.  When 
					the Reboot Session ID is 0 (i.e., persistent 
					Reboot Session IDs are not supported) and the Global Block Counter
					reaches its maximum value, then the Global Block Counter is reset to 0 
					and the Reboot Session ID MUST remain at 0.   
					
</p>
<p>
					Note that the Global Block Counter
					crosses Signature Groups; it allows one to roughly synchronize when
					two messages were sent, even though they went to different
					collectors and are part of different Signature Groups.  
					
</p>
<p>
					Because a reboot results in the start of a new reboot session, the originator MUST 
					reset the Global Block Counter to 0 after a reboot occurs.  
					Applications need to take into account the possibility that a 
					reboot occurred when authenticating 
					a log, and situations in which reboots occur frequently may result 
					in losing the ability to verify the proper sequence in which messages were
					sent, hence jeopardizing the integrity of the log.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
Preliminaries: Key Management and Distribution Issues</h3>

<p>
				A Payload Block contains public key certificate information that is to be conveyed to the
				collector.  A Payload Block is sent at the 
				beginning of a new reboot session, carrying public key 
				information in effect for the reboot session.  
				However, a Payload Block is not sent directly, but in (one or more) fragments.  
				Those fragments are termed Certificate Blocks.  Therefore, originators send at 
				least one Certificate Block at the beginning of a new reboot session.  
				
</p>
<p>
				There are three key points to understand about Certificate Blocks:

				</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
					They handle a variable-sized payload, fragmenting it if
					necessary and transmitting the fragments as legal syslog
					messages. This payload is built (as described below) at the
					beginning of a reboot session and is transmitted in pieces with
					each Certificate Block carrying a piece. There is
					exactly one Payload Block per reboot session.
					
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
					The Certificate Blocks are digitally signed. The originator does not
					sign the Payload Block, but the signatures on the Certificate
					Blocks ensure its authenticity. Note that it may not even be
					possible to verify the signature on the Certificate Blocks
					without the information in the Payload Block; in this case the
					Payload Block is reconstructed, the key is extracted, and then
					the Certificate Blocks are verified. (This is necessary even
					when the Payload Block carries a certificate, because some other
					fields of the Payload Block are not otherwise verified.)  In
					practice, most installations keep the same public key over
					long periods of time, so that most of the time, it is easy to
					verify the signatures on the Certificate Blocks, and use the
					Payload Block to provide other useful per-session information.
					
</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>
					The kind of Payload Block that is expected is determined by what
					kind of key material is on the collector that receives it. The
					originator and collector (or offline log viewer) both have some key
					material (such as a root public key or pre-distributed public
					key) and an acceptable value for the Key Blob Type in the
					Payload Block, below. The collector or offline log viewer MUST
					NOT accept a Payload Block of the wrong type.
					
</dd>

Block Format and Fields</h3>

<p>
				A Payload Block MUST have the following fields:  

				</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
					Full local time stamp for the originator at the time the reboot session started.  This 
					must be in the time stamp format specified in

					(essentially, time stamp format per

</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
					Key Blob Type, a one-octet field containing one of five values:

					
<ol class="text">
<li>
						'C' -- a PKIX certificate.
						
</li>
<li>
						'P' -- an OpenPGP certificate (a Transferable Public Key as defined in
						<a class='info' href='#RFC4880'>[RFC4880]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Callas, J., Donnerhacke, L., Finney, H., Shaw, D., and R. Thayer, &ldquo;OpenPGP Message Format,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, Section 11.1).
						
</li>
<li>
						'K' -- the public key whose corresponding private key is
						being used to sign these messages.  For the OpenPGP DSA signature scheme,
						this field contains the DSA prime p, DSA group order q, DSA group generator g, 
						and DSA public-key value y, encoded as four multiprecision integers 
						(see <a class='info' href='#RFC4880'>[RFC4880]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Callas, J., Donnerhacke, L., Finney, H., Shaw, D., and R. Thayer, &ldquo;OpenPGP Message Format,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, Sections 5.5.2 and 3.2).

					consisting of the raw key data.  
					
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
				
</p>
<p>
				The fields are separated by single space characters.  
				Because a Payload Block is not carried in a 
				syslog message directly, only the corresponding Certificate Blocks, it does not
				need to be encoded as an SD ELEMENT.    
				The Payload Block does not contain a field that identifies the reboot 
				session; instead, the reboot session can be inferred from the 
				Reboot Session ID parameter of the Certificate Blocks that are used to 
				carry the Payload Block.  
				
</p>

				If that transport is used, then the
				device will already have a PKIX certificate and it MAY use the
				private key associated with that certificate to sign messages.  
				In the case where there is no PKI, the chain of trust of a PKIX
				certificate must still be established to meet conventional security
				requirements. 
				The methods for doing this are described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5425'>[RFC5425]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Miao, F., Yuzhi, M., and J. Salowey, &ldquo;TLS Transport Mapping for syslog,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

				in scope of this specification:
				</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
					X.509 certification path validation: The collector is configured
					with one or more trust anchors (typically root CA certificates),
					which allow it to verify a binding between the subject name and

					as specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC5280'>[RFC5280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cooper, D., Santesson, S., Farrell, S., Boeyen, S., Housley, R., and W.

					Section 5.2. Comparing other forms of HOSTNAMEs is beyond the
					scope of this specification.
					<br />
<br />

				  
					Collectors SHOULD support this method.					
					<br />
<br />

					  
					Note that due to message size restrictions, syslog-sign sends
					only the end-entity certificate in the Payload Block. Depending
					on the PKI deployment, the collector may need to obtain
					intermediate certificates by other means (for example, from a
					directory).					
					
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
					  X.509 end-entity certificate matching: The collector is
					  configured with information necessary to identify the valid
					  end-entity certificates of its valid peers, and for each peer,
					  the HOSTNAME(s) it is authorized to use.
					  <br />

					
					  To ensure interoperability, implementations MUST support
					  fingerprints of X.509 certificates as described below. Other
					  methods MAY be supported.
					  <br />
<br />


					  Collectors MUST support key blob type 'C', and specifying the
					  list of valid peers using certificate fingerprints.  The

					  For each peer, the collector MUST support specifying a list of
					  HOSTNAME(s) this peer is allowed to use either as FQDNs or IP
					  addresses. Other forms of HOSTNAMEs are beyond the scope of this
					  specification.					
					  <br />
<br />


					  If the locally configured FQDN is an internationalized domain
					  name, conforming implementations MUST convert it to the ASCII
					  Compatible Encoding (ACE) format for performing comparisons as
					  specified in Section 7 of <a class='info' href='#RFC5280'>[RFC5280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cooper, D., Santesson, S., Farrell, S., Boeyen, S., Housley, R., and W.

syslog Messages Containing a Certificate Block</h3>

<p>
					Certificate Blocks are used to get the Payload Block to the collector.
					As with a Signature Block, each Certificate Block is carried in its 
					own syslog message, 
					called Certificate Block message.  
					
</p>
<p>
					Because certificates can legitimately be much longer than 2048 octets,
					the Payload Block can be split up into several pieces, with 
					each Certificate Block carrying a piece of the Payload Block.  
					Note
					that the originator MAY make the Certificate Blocks of any legal length
					(that is, any length that keeps the entire Certificate Block message 
					within 2048 octets) that holds all the
					required fields. Software that processes Certificate Blocks MUST
					deal correctly with blocks of any legal length.
					The length of the fragment of the Payload Block that a Certificate Block
					carries MUST be at least 1 octet.  The length SHOULD be chosen 
					such that the length of the Certificate
					Block message does not exceed 2048 octets.  
					
</p>
<p>
					A Certificate Block message 
					is identified by the presence of an
					SD ELEMENT 
					with an SD-ID with the value "ssign-cert".  
					In addition, a Certificate Block message 
					MUST contain valid APP-NAME, PROCID, and MSGID fields to be compliant with 
					syslog protocol.    
					Syslog-sign does not mandate particular values for these fields; however, 
					for consistency, an originator MUST use the 
					same value for APP-NAME, PROCID, and MSGID fields for 
					every Certificate Block message, whichever values are chosen.  
					It MUST also use the same value for its HOSTNAME field.  
					To allow for the possibility of multiple originators per host, 
					the combination of APP-NAME and PROCID MUST be unique for each such originator.  
					If an originator daemon is restarted, it MAY use a new PROCID for what is otherwise the 
					same originator.    The combination of APP-NAME and PROCID MUST be the same
					that is used for Signature Block messages of the same originator; however, a different
					MSGID MAY be used for Signature Block and Certificate Block messages.  
					It is RECOMMENDED to use 110 as value 
					for the PRI field, corresponding to facility 13 and severity 6 (informational).  
					The Certificate Block is 
					carried as Structured Data within the Certificate Block message.   
					It is also RECOMMENDED (but not required) that a Certificate Block 
					message carry no other Structured Data besides the Structured Data of the 
					Certificate Block itself.  
					The MSG part of a Certificate Block message SHOULD be empty.

				Its Signature Group is 0; its Signature Priority is 0.  The Total Payload Block Length

Redundancy and Flexibility</h3>

<p>
				As described in Section 8.5 of <a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, 
				a transport sender may
				discard syslog messages.  Likewise, when syslog messages are sent over
				unreliable transport, they can be lost in transit.  
				However, if a collector does not receive
				Signature and Certificate Blocks, many messages may not be able to
				be verified. The originator is allowed to send Signature and
				Certificate Blocks multiple times.  Sending Signature and Certificate Blocks 
				multiple times provides redundancy with the intent to ensure that
				the collector or relay does get the Signature Blocks and in particular the 
				Payload Block at some point in time.  In the meantime, any online review of logs 
				as described in <a class='info' href='#online'>Section&nbsp;7.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Online Review of Logs</span><span>)</span></a> is delayed until the 
				needed blocks are received.      
				The collector MUST ignore
				Signature Blocks and Certificate Blocks it has already received and
				authenticated.  The originator can in principle change its redundancy
				level for any reason, without communicating this fact to the
				collector.
				
</p>
<p>
				The originator does not need to queue up other messages while sending 
				redundant Certificate Block and Signature Block messages.  It MAY send redundant 
				Certificate Block messages even after Signature Block messages 
				and regular syslog messages have been sent.  By the same token, it MAY
				send redundant Signature Block messages even after newer syslog messages 
				that are signed by a subsequent Signature Block have been sent, or even 
				after a subsequent Signature Block message.  
				
</p>
<p> 
				In addition, the originator has flexibility in how many hashes to include within 
				a Signature Block.  It is legitimate for an originator to send short Signature
				Blocks to allow the collector to verify messages with minimal delay.

<a name="rfc.section.6.1.1"></a><h3>6.1.1.&nbsp;
Configuration Parameters for Certificate Blocks</h3>

<p>
					Certificate Blocks are always sent at the beginning of a new reboot
					session.  One technique to ensure reliable delivery (see Section 8.5) is to send 
					multiple copies. This can be controlled by a "certInitialRepeat" parameter:

					</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
					certInitialRepeat = number of times each Certificate Block should be
					sent before the first message is sent.  
					
</p>
</blockquote><p>
					It is also useful to resend Certificate Blocks every now and then
					for long-lived reboot sessions. This can be controlled by the certResendDelay 
					and certResendCount parameters:

					</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
					certResendDelay  = maximum time delay in seconds until resending the  
					Certificate Block.    
					
</p>
<p>
					certResendCount  = maximum number of other syslog messages to send until resending 
					the Certificate Block.  
					
</p>
</blockquote><p>
					In some cases, it may be desirable to allow for configuration of the
					transport sender such that Certificate Blocks are not sent at all after
					the first normal syslog message has been sent.
					This could be expressed by 
					setting both certResendDelay and certResendCount to "0".  	
					However, it is RECOMMENDED
					to configure the transport sender to send redundant Certificate Blocks even after the 
					first message is sent when the UDP transport <a class='info' href='#RFC5426'>[RFC5426]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Okmianski, A., &ldquo;Transmission of syslog Messages over UDP,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>

Configuration Parameters for Signature Blocks</h3>

					Verification of log messages involves a certain delay of time that is caused by the lag in time
					between the sending of the message itself and the corresponding Signature Block.  
					The following configuration parameter can be useful to limit the time lag that will

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Overlapping Signature Blocks</h3>

<p>
				Notwithstanding the fact that the originator is not constrained in whether it 
				decides to send redundant Signature Block messages, Signature Blocks SHOULD NOT overlap.  
				This facilitates their processing by the receiving collector.  
				This means that an originator of 
				Signature Block messages, after having sent a first message with some
				First Message Number and a Count, SHOULD NOT send a second message with the same 
				First Message Number but a different Count.   
				It also means that an originator of Signature Block messages SHOULD NOT 
				send a second message whose First Message Number is greater than the First Message 
				Number, but smaller than the First Message Number plus the Count indicated in the 
				first message.  
				
</p>
<p>
				That said, the possibility of Signature Blocks that overlap does provide additional
				flexibility with regards to redundancy; it provides an additional option that may 
				be desirable in some deployments.  
				Therefore collectors MUST be designed in a way that they can cope with
				overlapping Signature Blocks when confronted with them.   The collector MUST
				ignore hashes of messages that it has already received and validated.

<a name="rfc.section.7.1"></a><h3>7.1.&nbsp;
Offline Review of Logs</h3>

<p>
				When the collector stores logs to be reviewed later, they can be
				authenticated offline just before they are reviewed. Reviewing these
				logs offline is simple and relatively inexpensive in terms of resources
				used, so long as there is enough space available on the reviewing
				machine. Here, we presume that the stored log files containing Certificate
				Block and Signature Block messages have
				already been separated by originator 
				(as identified by HOSTNAME, APP-NAME, PROCID), 
				Reboot Session ID, and Signature Group. 
				This can be done easily with a script file. We then do the following:

				</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
					First, we go through the raw log file and split its contents
					into three files. Each message in the raw log file is classified
					as a normal message, a Signature Block message, or a Certificate Block message.
					Signature Blocks and Certificate Blocks are then stored in their own
					files. Normal messages are stored in a keyed file, indexed on
					their hash values.
					
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
					We sort the Certificate Block file by INDEX value, and check to
					see whether we have a set of Certificate Blocks that can reconstruct
					the Payload Block. If so, we reconstruct the Payload Block,
					verify any key-identifying information, and then use this to
					verify the signatures on the Certificate Blocks we have received.
					When this is done, we have verified the reboot session and key
					used for the rest of the process.
					
</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>
					We sort the Signature Block file by First Message Number. We now
					create an authenticated log file, which consists of some
					header information and then a sequence of message number,
					message text pairs. We next go through the Signature Block file.
					We initialize a cursor for the last message number processed with the number 0.  
					For each Signature Block in the file, we do the following:
					
					
<ol class="text">
<li>
						Verify the signature on the Signature Block.
						
</li>
<li>
						If the value of the First Message Number of the Signature Block is less than or equal 
						to the last message number processed, skip the first (last message number processed
						minus First Message Number plus 1) hashes.  
						
</li>
<li>
						For each remaining hashed message in the Signature Block:

						
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
							Look up the hash value in the keyed message file.
							
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
							If the message is found, write (message number, message
							text) to the authenticated log file.
							
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
						
</li>
<li>
						Set the last message number processed to the value of the 
						First Message Number plus the Count of the Signature Block
						minus 1.  
						
</li>
<li>
						Skip all other Signature Blocks with the same
						First Message Number unless one with a larger Count is encountered.
						
</li>
</ol>
					
					The resulting authenticated log file contains all messages
					that have been authenticated.  In addition, it implicitly indicates 
					all gaps in the authenticated messages (specifically 
					in the case when all messages of the same Signature Group 
					are sent to the same collector), because their 
					message numbers are missing. 
					
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
				
				One can see that, assuming sufficient space for building
				the keyed file, this whole process is linear in the number of
				messages (generally two seeks, one to write and the other to read,
				per normal message received), and O(N lg N) in the number of
				Signature Blocks. This estimate comes with two caveats: first, the
				Signature Blocks arrive very nearly in sorted order, and so can
				probably be sorted more cheaply on average than O(N lg N) steps.
				Second, the signature verification on each Signature Block
				almost certainly is more expensive than the sorting step in
				practice. We have not discussed error-recovery, which may be
				necessary for the Certificate Blocks. In practice, a simple
				error-recovery strategy is probably enough: if the Payload
				Block is not valid, then we can just try alternate
				instances of each Certificate Block, if such are available, until we
				get the Payload Block right.
				
</p>
<p>
				It is easy for an attacker to flood us with plausible-looking
				messages, Signature Blocks, and Certificate Blocks.

Online Review of Logs</h3>

<p>
				Some collector implementations may need to monitor log
				messages in close to real-time. This can be done with
				syslog-sign, though it is somewhat more complex than offline
				verification. This is done as follows:
				
				</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>
					We have an authenticated message file, into which we write (message number,
					message text) pairs which have been authenticated. Again, we will
					assume that we are handling only one originator, Signature Group, and 
					Reboot Session ID at any given time.
					
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>
					We have three data structures: A queue in which (message
					number, hash of message) pairs are kept in sorted order, a queue
					in which (arrival sequence, hash of message) pairs are kept in sorted
					order, and a hash table that stores (message text, count) pairs
					indexed by hash value. In the hash table, count may be any number
					greater than zero; when count is zero, the entry in the hash
					table is cleared.
					
</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>
					We must receive all the Certificate Blocks before any other
					processing can really be done. (This is why they are sent first.)
					Once that is done, any additional Certificate Block message that arrives is
					discarded.  
					Any syslog messages or Signature Block messages that arrive before all 
					Certificate Blocks have been received need to be buffered.  Once all 
					Certificate Blocks have been received, the messages in the buffer can be 
					retrieved and processed as if they were just arriving.  
					
</dd>
<dt>d.</dt>
<dd>
					Whenever a normal message arrives, we add (arrival sequence,
					hash of message) to our message queue. If our hash table has an
					entry for the message's hash value, we increment its count by
					one; otherwise, we create a new entry with count = 1. If the
					message queue is full, we roll the oldest messages off the queue
					by taking the oldest entry in the queue, and using it to index the
					hash table. If that entry has count 1, we delete the entry from
					the hash table; otherwise, we decrement its count.  We then
					delete the oldest entry in the queue.
					
</dd>
<dt>e.</dt>
<dd>
					Whenever a Signature Block message arrives, we check its originator
					(by way of HOSTNAME, APP-NAME, PROCID), Signature Group, and Reboot
					Session ID to ensure it matches our Certificate Blocks.  
					We then check to see whether the
					First Message Number value is too old to still be of interest, 
					or if another Signature
					Block with that First Message Number and the same Count or a greater Count 
					has already been received. If
					so, we discard the Signature Block. 
					
					Otherwise, we check
					its signature and discard it if the signature is not valid. 
					
					A Signature Block contains a sequence hashes, each of which is associated 
					with a message number, starting with the First Message Number for the first 
					hash and incrementing by one for each subsequent hash.  
					
					For each hash, we first check to see whether the message
					hash is in the hash table. If this is the case, we do the following:
					
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>
						We check if a message with the same message 
						number is already in the authenticated message queue.  
						
</dd>
<dt>B.</dt>
<dd>
						If that is not the case, we write the (message
						number, message text) into the authenticated message queue, 
						otherwise the signed hash is a duplicate and we discard it.  
						
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
									
					Otherwise (the message hash is not in the hash table), 
					we write the (message number, message hash) to the
					message number queue. This generally involves rolling the oldest
					entry out of this queue: before this is done, that entry's hash
					value is again looked up in the hash table. If a matching
					entry is found, a check is made if the authenticated message file already contains
					an entry with the same message number and if that is not the case, 
					the (message number, message text) pair is
					written to the authenticated message.  In either case,
					the oldest entry is then discarded.
					
</dd>
<dt>f.</dt>
<dd>
					The result of this is a sequence of messages in the
					authenticated message file, each of which has been
					authenticated, and which are labeled with numbers showing their
					order of original transmission.
					
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
				
				One can see that this whole process is roughly linear
				in the number of messages, and also in the number of Signature
				Blocks received. The process is susceptible to flooding attacks; an
				attacker can send enough normal messages that the messages roll off
				their queue before their Signature Blocks can be processed.

			is its own trust anchor. If a transport sender sends a stream of syslog messages that is 
			signed using a certificate, the operator or application will transfer to the transport receiver 
			the certificate that was used when signing. There is no need for a certificate chain.

Cryptographic Constraints</h3>

<p>
				As with any technology involving cryptography, it is advisable to check
				the current literature to determine whether any algorithms used here
				have been found to be vulnerable to attack.
				
</p>
<p>
				This specification uses Public Key Cryptography
				technologies. The proper party or parties have to control
				the private key portion of a public-private key pair.
				Any party that controls a private key can sign anything
				it pleases.
				
</p>
<p>
				Certain operations in this specification involve the use of
				random numbers. An appropriate entropy source SHOULD be used to
				generate these numbers. See <a class='info' href='#RFC4086'>[RFC4086]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eastlake, D., Schiller, J., and S. Crocker, &ldquo;Randomness Recommendations for Security,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>

Packet Parameters</h3>

<p>
				As an originator, it is advisable to avoid message lengths exceeding 2048 octets.  
				Various problems might result
				if an originator were to send messages with a length greater than 2048
				octets, because relays MAY truncate messages with lengths 
				greater than 2048 octets which would make it impossible for collectors to 				
				validate a hash of the packet.  To increase
				the chance of interoperability, it tends to be  
				best to be conservative with what
				you send but liberal in what you are able to receive.  
				
</p>
<p>
				Originators need to rigidly enforce the correctness of message bodies.
				Problems may 
				arise if the collector does not fully accept the syslog packets sent from an
				originator, or if it has problems with the format of the Certificate Block or
				Signature Block messages.
				
</p>
<p>
				Collectors are not to malfunction in case they receive malformed syslog messages or 
				messages containing characters other than those specified in this document.  In other 
				words, they are to ignore such messages and continue working.

Message Authenticity</h3>

<p>
				Syslog does not strongly associate the message
				with the message originator.  That association is established by the collector upon verification
				of the Signature Block.  Before a Signature Block is used to
				ascertain the authenticity of an event message, it might be received, stored, and
				reviewed by a person or automated parser.  It is advisable not to assume a message is 
				authentic until after a message has been
				validated by checking the contents of the Signature Block.
				
</p>
<p>
				With the Signature Block checking, an attacker may only forge messages if he or she
				can compromise the private key of the true originator.

Replaying</h3>

<p>
				Event messages might be recorded and replayed by an
				attacker.  Using the information contained in the
				Signature Blocks, a reviewer can determine whether the received messages are the ones
				originally sent by an originator.  The reviewer can also identify messages that have 
				been replayed.

				the reliable delivery of syslog messages; 
				however, it does not protect against loss of syslog messages at the 
				application layer, for example if the TCP connection or TLS session has been 
				closed by the transport receiver for some reason.  
				A reviewer can pinpoint any messages sent by the originator but not 
				received by the collector by reviewing the Signature Block information.  
				In addition, the information in
				subsequent Signature Blocks allows a
				reviewer to determine whether any Signature Block messages
				were lost in transit.

Sequenced Delivery</h3>

<p>
				Syslog messages delivered over UDP might not only be lost, but
				also arrive out of sequence.  
				A reviewer can determine the original order of syslog messages and identify 
				which messages were delivered out of order by examining the information 
				in the Signature Block

Message Integrity</h3>

<p>
				Syslog messages might be damaged in transit.  A review of
				the information in the Signature Block determines whether
				the received message was the intended message sent by
				the originator. A damaged Signature Block or Certificate
				Block is evident because the collector will not be
				able to validate that it was signed by the originator.

				event messages, Certificate Blocks, and Signature Blocks are all sent in plaintext.  
				This allows network administrators to read the
				message when sniffing the wire.  However, this also allows an attacker to see the
				contents of event messages and perhaps to use that information for malicious purposes.

Man In The Middle Attacks</h3>

<p>
				It is conceivable that an attacker might intercept Certificate Block messages and insert its
				own Certificate information.  In that case, the attacker would be able to receive
				event messages from the actual originator and then relay modified messages, insert new
				messages, or delete messages.  It would then be able to construct a Signature Block
				and sign it with its own private key.  Network administrators need to verify
				that the key contained in the Payload Block is indeed the key being used on the
				actual originator.  If that is the case, then this MITM attack will not succeed.
				Methods for establishing a chain of trust are also described 
				in <a class='info' href='#RFC5425'>[RFC5425]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Miao, F., Yuzhi, M., and J. Salowey, &ldquo;TLS Transport Mapping for syslog,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Denial of Service</h3>

<p>

				An attacker might send invalid Signature Block messages to overwhelm the collector's 
				processing capability and consume all available resources.
				For this reason, it can be appropriate to simply 
				receive the Signature Block messages and process them only as time permits.
				
</p>
<p>
				An attacker might also just overwhelm a collector by sending more
				messages to it than it can handle.   
				Implementers are advised to consider features that minimize this threat,  
				such as only accepting syslog messages from known IP addresses.
