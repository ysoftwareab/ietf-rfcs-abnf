    Micro-burst Decreasing in Layer3 Network for Low-Latency Traffic
                 draft-du-detnet-layer3-low-latency-04

Abstract

   It is complex to support deterministic forwarding in a large scale
   network because there is too much dynamic traffic in the network and
   the data model becomes hard to predict after aggregation in the
   intermediate nodes.  This document introduces the problem of micro-
   bursts in layer3 network, and analyses the method to decrease the
   micro-bursts in layer3 network for low-latency traffic.

1.  Introduction

   The DetNet architecture [RFC8655] is supposed to work in campus-wide
   networks and private WANs, including the large-scale ISP network
   scenario, such as the 5G bearing network, as mentioned in [RFC8578].
   It is essential for the large-scale ISP network to be able to provide
   the low-latency service.  The low-latency requirement exists in both
   L2 and L3 networks, and in both small and large networks.

   However, as talked in [I-D.qiang-detnet-large-scale-detnet],
   deploying deterministic services in a large-scale network brings a
   lot of new challenges.  A novel method called LDN (Large-scale
   Deterministic Network) is introduced in
   [I-D.qiang-detnet-large-scale-detnet] and
   [I-D.dang-queuing-with-multiple-cyclic-buffers], which explore the
   deterministic forwarding over a large-scale network.

   This document also explores the deterministic service in the large-
   scale layer 3 network, and analyses the method based on micro-burst
   decreasing, which can benefit the forwarding of low-latency traffic
   in the large-scale network.

2.  Gaps for Large-scale Layer 3 Deterministic Network

   In this document, the large-scale network means that there are many
   dynamic flows in the network, but it is hard to do per-flow shaping
   on the intermediate nodes because they have high pressure on
   forwarding on the data plane.

   According to [RFC8655], DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers
   service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and IEEE 802.1
   Time-Sensitive Networking [TSN].  However, the TSN mechanisms are
   designed for L2 network originally, and cannot be directly used in
   the large-scale layer 3 network because of various reasons.  Some of
   them are described as below.

   Some TSN mechanisms need synchronization of the network equipments,
   which is easier in a small network, but hard in a large network.  It
   brings in some complex maintenance jobs across a long distance that
   are not needed before.

   Some TSN mechanisms need a per-flow state in the forwarding plane,
   which is un-scalable.  Aggregation methods need to be considered.

   Some TSN mechanisms need a constant and forecastable traffic
   characteristics, which is more complicated in a large network which
   includes much more flows joining in or leaving randomly and the
   traffic characteristics are more dynamic.

   The main aspects of the problems are the simplicity and the
   scalability.  The former can ensure that the mechanism is easy to
   deploy, and the second can ensure that the mechanism is able to bear
   a large number of deterministic services.

3.  Micro-burst Problem in IP Forwarding

   The current IP forwarding mechanism is considered to be a good
   example fulfilling the requirements of simplicity and scalability.
   However, the traditional IP network is based on statistical
   multiplexing, and can only provide Best Effort service, short of SLA
   guaranteed mechanisms.

   When we rethink the problem in the current IP forwarding mechanism,
   we can find that in the current IP network, a long delay in queuing,
   or some packet losses due to burst are acceptable; however, it may be
   unacceptable in the deterministic forwarding.  Therefore, they have
   different design principles in the low layer.

   The current forwarding mechanism in an IP router, which is based on
   statistical multiplexing, can not provide the deterministic service

   because of various reasons.  Even be given a high priority, a
   critical packet can experience a long congestion delay or be lost in
   a relatively light-loaded network, which is caused by micro-bursts in
   the network.

   Micro-burst is a special case of network congestion, which typically
   lasts a short period, at the granularity of millisecond.  In a micro-
   burst, a lot of data are received on the interface suddenly, and the
   temporary bandwidth requirement would be tens of or hundreds of the
   average bandwidth requirement, or even exceed the interface
   bandwidth.

   In most cases, the buffer on the equipment can handle the micro-
   bursts.  However, in some corner cases, micro-bursts bring in a long
   delay (for example, at the granularity of millisecond) or even packet
   loss.

   The following paragraphs introduce the causes of the micro-burst.

   Firstly, IP traffic has an instinct of burstiness no matter in the
   macro or micro aspect, i.e., it does not have a constant traffic
   model even after aggregations.

   Secondly, IP network has a flexible topology, where the incoming
   traffic may exceed the bandwidth of the outgoing interface.  For
   example, an interface with a large bandwidth may need to send traffic
   to an interface with a smaller bandwidth, or multiple flows from
   several incoming interfaces may need to occupy the same outgoing
   interface.

   Thirdly, the IP node has been designed to send traffic as quickly as
   possible, and it is not aware whether the downstream node's buffer
   can handle the traffic.  For example, Figure 1 below shows the
   problem of the current IP scheduling mechanism.  Before the
   scheduling in an IP network, the packets are well paced, but after
   the scheduling, the packets will be gathered even the total traffic
   rate is unchanged.  When an IP outgoing interface receives multiple
   critical flows from several incoming interfaces, the situation
   becomes worse.  However, an IP router will try to send them as soon
   as possible, so occasionally, in some later hops, micro-bursts will
   emerge.

4.  Analysis of the Method to Decrease Micro-bursts

   This document analyses the method to support the low latency traffic
   bearing in an IP network, such as the 5G bearing network, by avoiding
   micro-bursts in the network as much as possible.  The principle in
   this method is to forward critical and BE traffic separately, and do
   not distinguish different critical flows on the forwarding plane on
   the intermediate nodes.

   As talked before, the target method should be scalable and easy to
   deploy.  As the intermediate nodes have high pressure on forwarding
   packets, the target method should not bring in too much complex
   process on the data plane.  Several requirements are listed as
   follows.

   The first is that the DetNet traffic should support aggregation.  The
   intermediate nodes should not do per-flow process on the date plane.

   The second is that separation process of the control plane and data
   plane on the intermediate nodes.  The status of the aggregated DetNet
   traffic on the control plane may change frequently in the large-scale
   network.  We should not assume that the control plane on an
   intermediate node can interact with the data plane frequently, for
   example, to change a shaper parameter frequently.  On the data plane,
   some self-decision process should be supported.

5.  An Example of Method to Decrease Micro-bursts

   In this section, we describes an example of method fulfilling the
   requirements mentioned in the last section.  It needs the cooperation
   of the edge nodes and the forwarding/intermediate nodes in an IP
   network.

5.1.  Working Flow of the Method

   Generally, the method contains two steps:

   Step1: per flow schedule on the edge node.  The purpose is to make
   sure that each critical traffic has a constant traffic model.

   Step2: per interface schedule on the intermediate node.  Traffic are
   aggregated to ensure the scalability, and the pacing also makes sure
   that they do not gather.  The purpose is to make the critical traffic
   be forwarded as the shape when outgoing the edge, not as quickly as
   possible.  We assume that the sending rate of the buffer for the
   critical traffic is the same as the receiving rate (how to achieve
   this is out of scope of this document).  If all work well, the buffer
   will be maintained with a proper depth.

   Other requirements include an RSVP-TE liked mechanism with a good
   scalability, which should be used to make sure the bandwidth is not
   exceeded on the interface.

5.2.  Process of Edge Node

   The edge node of the IP network can recognize each critical flows
   just as in the TSN network, and then give them individually a good
   shaping.  In fact, in TSN mechanisms, no micro-burst will emerge for
   critical traffic, and each TSN mechanism is proved to be effective
   under certain conditions.

   This document suggests the edge node to shape the critical traffic by
   using the CBS method in [IEEE802.1Qav], or the shaping methods in
   [IEEE802.1Qcr].  Generally, the shaping methods can generate a paced
   traffic for each critical flow.

   The parameters of the shaper, such as the sending rate, can be
   configured for each flow by some means.

5.3.  Process of Forwarding Node

   For the forwarding node, it is uneasy to recognize each critical flow
   because of the high pressure of forwarding a large amount of packets.
   It is suggested that no per-flow state is maintained on the
   forwarding node.  It is to say that, on the forwarding node, the
   critical flows should be aggregated and handled together.

   This document suggests that the forwarding node can deploy a specific
   queue on each outgoing interface.  The queue will buffer all critical
   traffic that need to go out through that interface, and will pace
   them by using methods mentioned in the last section.

Internet-Draft           L3 Low-latency Traffic             October 2021


   A shaping method in TSN is used here instead of the original
   forwarding method in an IP router, which can make the critical
   traffic be forwarded orderly instead of as soon as possible.
   Therefore, micro-bursts can be decreased in the network.

   If all the forwarding nodes can do their jobs properly, i.e., they
   can well pace the critical traffic, no or rare micro-bursts for the
   critical traffic would take place.  In this way, the critical traffic
   will have a relatively low latency in the IP network with less
   uncertainty of micro-bursts.

   As no per-flow state is maintained on the forwarding node, the
   sending rate of the shaper is hard to decide.  As said in the last
   session, the sending rate is suggested to be adjusted referring to
   the incoming rate of the queue.  The purpose is to maintain a proper
   buffer depth for the queue.

   Although it is claimed that the proposed method is simpler than the
   TSN mechanisms, forwarding/intermediate nodes also need to be
   updated.  The detailed realization of the method on the intermediate
   nodes is out of scope of this document.

5.4.  Analysis of the Proposed Method

   The method proposed does not need synchronization, just as the
   asynchronous mechanisms studied in [IEEE802.1Qcr].  Furthermore, the
   method has a larger aggregation granularity, which can fulfill the
   requirements of simplicity and scalability as much as possible.
   However, in theory, it has a larger uncertainty on the forwarding
   than the zero congestion loss target in the TSN mechanisms.

   We compare three mechanisms in the following paragraphs.  The first
   is the priority based light-load mechanism, i.e., the traditional
   method.  The second is the TSN mechanism, such as CQF.  The third is
   the proposed mechanism.

   In the first mechanism, we only give a high priority to the critical
   traffic, and thus the scalability of the deterministic system is
   good.  However, the uncertainty on the forwarding plane perhaps can
   not fulfill the requirements in the industry network where SLA
   requirements are very essential.  Perhaps, it is only able to work
   well when a small amount of critical traffic exist in the network.

   If we use the scheduling method in the TSN, such as CQF.  Its
   uncertainty is very low, but its scalability is not very good as said
   in Section 2.  It should be noted that in a large deterministic
   system, the ISP normally will not guarantee the user 100 percent
   reliability, instead of which it perhaps is a value very close to.

   The proposed method has a better scalability than the TSN mechanisms,
   and a better reliability than the priority based method.  If we
   assume that different services need different deterministic levels,
   this method may be helpful for the service that does not need a very
   high deterministic level.  For example, the method can be used in the
   consumption Internet, in which the deterministic service needs a
   relatively lower deterministic level than the industry Internet.
