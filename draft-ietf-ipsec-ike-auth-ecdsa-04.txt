   This document describes how the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) may be used as the authentication method within
   the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.  ECDSA may provide benefits
   including computational efficiency, small signature sizes, and 
   minimal bandwidth compared to other available digital signature 
   methods.  This document adds ECDSA capability to IKE without 
   introducing any changes to existing IKE operation.

INTERNET-DRAFT       IKE Authentication Using ECDSA             May 2005 


1. Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange, or IKE [IKE], is a key agreement and 
   security negotiation protocol; it is used for key establishment in 
   IPSec.  In Phase 1 of IKE, both parties must authenticate each other
   using a negotiated authentication method.  One option for the 
   authentication method is digital signatures using public key 
   cryptography.  Currently, there are two digital signature methods 
   defined for use within Phase 1: RSA signatures and DSA (DSS) 
   signatures.  This document introduces ECDSA signatures as a third 
   method.

   For any given level of security against the best attacks known, ECDSA
   signatures are smaller than RSA signatures and ECDSA keys require 
   less bandwidth than DSA keys; there are also advantages of 
   computational speed and efficiency in many settings.  Additional 
   efficiency may be gained by simultaneously using ECDSA for IKE 
   authentication and using elliptic curve groups for the IKE key 
   exchange.  Implementers of IPSec and IKE may therefore find it 
   desirable to use ECDSA as the Phase 1 authentication method.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. ECDSA 

   The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is the 
   elliptic curve analogue of the DSA (DSS) signature method [DSS].  It
   is defined in the ANSI X9.62 standard [X9.62].  Other compatible 
   specifications include FIPS 186-2 [DSS], IEEE 1363 [IEEE-1363], IEEE
   1363A [IEEE-1363A], and SEC1 [SEC1].  

   Like DSA, ECDSA incorporates the use of a hash function.  [SHS] 
   specifies hash functions that are appropriate for use with ECDSA.
   Implementations of IKE using ECDSA SHOULD use one of these hash 
   functions.

   ECDSA signatures are smaller than RSA signatures of similar 
   cryptographic strength.  ECDSA public keys (and certificates) are 
   smaller than similar strength DSA keys, resulting in improved 
   communications efficiency.  Furthermore, on many platforms ECDSA 
   operations can be computed more quickly than similar strength RSA or
   DSA operations (see [LV] for a security analysis of key sizes across
   public key algorithms).  These advantages of signature size, 
   bandwidth, and computational efficiency may make ECDSA an attractive
   choice for many IKE implementations.

INTERNET-DRAFT       IKE Authentication Using ECDSA             May 2005


   Recommended elliptic curve domain parameters for use with ECDSA are
   given in FIPS 186-2 [DSS], ANSI X9.62 [X9.62], and SEC 2 [SEC2].  

   Implementations of IKE using ECDSA MAY use one of these domain 
   parameters.  A subset of these parameters are recommended in 
   [IKE-ECP] for use in the IKE key exchange.  These parameters MAY 
   be used for ECDSA as well.


3. Specifying ECDSA within IKE

   The IKE key negotiation protocol consists of two phases, Phase 1 and
   Phase 2.  Within Phase 1, the two negotiating parties authenticate 
   each other, using either pre-shared keys, digital signatures, or 
   public-key encryption.  For digital signatures and public-key 
   encryption methods, there are multiple options.  The IANA-assigned  
   attribute number for Phase 1 authentication using ECDSA is 8 (see 
   [IANA]).

   Phase 1 can be either Main Mode or Aggressive Mode.  The use and
   specification of ECDSA signatures as the authentication method 
   applies to both modes.  The sequence of Phase 1 message payloads is 
   the same with ECDSA signatures as with DSS or RSA signatures.

   When ECDSA is used in IKE, the signature payload SHALL contain an
   encoding of the computed signature, consisting of a pair of integers 
   r and s, encoded as a byte string using the ASN.1 syntax 
   "ECDSA-Sig-Value" with DER encoding rules as specified in ANSI X9.62 
   [X9.62].

   As with the other digital signature methods, ECDSA authentication 
   requires the parties to know and trust each other's public key.  This
   can be done by exchanging certificates, possibly within the Phase 1 
   negotiation, if the public keys of the parties are not already known 
   to each other.  The use of Internet X.509 public key infrastructure 
   certificates [RFC-3280] is recommended; the representation of ECDSA 
   keys in X.509 certificates is specified in [RFC-3279].  This 
   representation SHOULD be used if X.509 certificates are used.

   Implemententers may find it convenient, when using ECDSA as the 
   authentication method, to specify the hash used by ECDSA as the 
   value of the hash algorithm attribute.  Implementers may also find 
   it convenient to use ECDSA authentication in conjunction with an 
   elliptic curve group for the IKE Diffie-Hellman key agreement; see
   [IKE-ECP] for some specific curves for the key agreement.

4. Security Considerations

   Implementors should ensure that appropriate security measures are in
   place when they deploy ECDSA within IKE.  In particular, the security
   of ECDSA requires the careful selection of both key sizes and 
   elliptic curve domain parameters.  Selection guidelines for these 
   parameters and some specific recommended curves that are considered 
   safe are provided in ANSI X9.62 [X9.62], FIPS 186-2 [DSS], and SEC 2
   [SEC2].
