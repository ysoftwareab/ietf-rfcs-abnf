1.  Document Scope

   This document only adds a new Service Tag.

2.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol, LoST [RFC5222] defines
   a mapping service with the additional ability to request that a civic
   address be validated.  The National Emergency Number Association
   (NENA) has defined an architecture (known as "i3" [NENA-i3]) which
   defines the mapping and routing functions as two distinct roles,
   defined as an Emergency Call Routing Function (ECRF) and a Location
   Verification Function (LVF).  NENA i3 requires that the mapping
   (ECRF) and validation (LVF) functions be separable, so that an entity
   responsible for a LoST server cluster can decide to provide mapping
   and validation services using consolidated or separate server
   clusters (i.e., using the same or separate boxes).  The rationale is
   that the mapping service is used in real-time during emergency call
   routing, while the validation service is used in advance, typically
   when data is provisioned, and therefore the mapping service has much
   higher availability and response time requirements than the
   validation service.  An organization might choose to deploy these
   services using different server clusters to make it easier to provide
   higher levels of service for the mapping function while shielding it
   from the potentially bursty load of validation, while another
   organization might choose to use the same sets of servers for both,
   configured and deployed to offer the high service level demanded of
   the mapping service.

Internet-Draft               LoST-Validation                January 2020


   In order to permit this separability, any entity querying a LoST
   server needs to be able to resolve an Application Unique String (AUS)
   into a URL for a server that offers the required service (mapping or
   validation).  This separability needs to be maintained throughout the
   LoST tree structure, from forest guide to leaf node.  Because LoST
   referrals return an AUS rather than a URL, different Service Tags are
   needed for the different services.  This document adds 'LoST-
   Validation' to the S-NAPTR Application Service Tag registry created
   by [RFC3958].  The 'LoST-Validation' tag serves as a counterpart to
   the 'LoST' tag added by [RFC4848]: The 'LoST' tag identifies servers
   able to perform the core mapping function, while 'LoST-Validation'
   identifies servers explicitly willing to perform the validation
   function.

   Because some servers might be configured to provide both mapping and
   validation functions, a server identified using the 'LoST' service
   tag might also perform the validation function (and resolving the two
   tags might result in the same URL).  Because the two functions might
   be separate, clients seeking a LoST server for location validation
   should first try U-NAPTR resolution using the 'Lost-Validation'
   service tag, and may fallback to the 'LoST' service tag if the 'Lost-
   Validation' service tag cannot be resolved to a usable LoST server.

3.  The LoST-Validation Application Service Tag

   LoST [RFC4848] specifies that LoST servers are located by resolving
   an application Unique String (AUS) using U-NAPTR/DDDS (URI-Enabled
   NAPTR/Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service) [RFC4848], and defines
   the 'LoST' Application service tag.  In order to permit separability
   of the mapping and validation services performed using LoST, this
   document defines the 'LoST-Validation' service tag.  NAPTR records
   for LoST servers available for location validation contain the 'LoST-
   Validation' service tag.  An entity needing to perform location
   validation using LoST performs the discovery procedure as described
   in [RFC4848], except that the 'LoST-Validation' service tag is used
   in preference to the 'LoST' service tag.  For both service tags, the
   HTTP and HTTPS URL schemes are used.  In the absense of any NAPTR
   records containing the 'LoST-Validation' service tag, the 'LoST'
   service tag is used.  Fallback to the 'LoST' service tag may follow
   if the 'Lost-Validation' service tag fails to result in a usable LoST
   server.  Using the 'LoST-Validation' service tag might result in the
   same URL as the 'LoST' service tag, or it may result in a different
   URL.  The URLs might result in the same physical servers being
   contacted, or different servers.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC3958] and [RFC4848]
   apply here.  No additional security aspects are foreseen by the
   addition of an extra tag.  Separation of services might be desired,
   for example, to be able to allocate different levels of resources
   (such as server capacity, attack mitigation, bandwidth, etc.) to the
   mapping and validation services, in which case separate tags are
   needed to allow LoST clients (which may include other LoST servers)
   to identify the correct server cluster.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add 'LoST-Validation' to the S-NAPTR Application
   Service Tag registry created by [RFC3958]  This tag serves as a
   counterpart to the 'LoST' tag added by [RFC5222].

   (Note that IANA and [RFC3958] call this registry "S-NAPTR Application
   Service Tags" while [RFC5222] calls it "U-NAPTR application service
   tag".)

5.1.  S-NAPTR Registration

   This document registers an S-NAPTR application service tag:

      Application Service Tag: LoST-Validation
