1.  Introduction

   This document changes the assignment policy of the PIM Join Attribute
   registry from IETF Review to Specification Required.  The assignment
   polices are defined in [RFC5226].  With this change there is no
   longer a need for an RFC to be published to assign new join
   attributes, but a specification must be publicly available, and it
   will be reviewed by a Designated Expert as defined in [RFC5226].

2.  Motivation

   The assignment policy for the PIM Join Attribute registry was
   initially IETF Review as specified in [RFC5384].  However, this
   requires an RFC to be published prior to assignment.  There are cases
   where there is a strong desire to deploy a new protocol or product
   relying on new Join Attributes without having to wait for the IETF
   standardisation process.  By changing the policy to Specification
   Required, there will still be a public specification and a review
   process to ensure it is technically sound, but without waiting for an
   RFC to be published.

3.  Review Criteria

   The expert is expected to ensure that the specification is of
   sufficient quality to ensure interoperability between
   implementations, that it does not conflict with how PIM operates,
   that it will not cause potential deployment issues, and that it does
   not conflict with other multicast protocols or work in the IETF.
   Also, potential security implications must be considered.

   In line with [RFC5384], join attribute specifications are required to
   specify the procedure to apply if there are multiple instances of the
   same attribute type.  Also it should be considered whether it is
   appropriate for the attribute to be transitive or not.  The conflict
   resolution procedure must also be considered.  If a procedure is

   specified, does it work as desired, or if not specified, is the
   default procedure specified in [RFC5384] appropriate for the
   attribute.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document by itself only changes a registry assignment policy
   which does not have any security issues in itself.  When a Designated
   Expert reviews a new attribute specification, it is expected that the
   reviewer also considers the security aspects.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The assignment policy for the PIM Join Attribute registry is changed
   to Specification Required.  IANA will need to update the registry
   description and accept and process assignment requests accordingly.

6.  Acknowledgments

   There have been discussions about assignment policies for the Join
   Attribute registry in the PIM WG, with several participants, William
   Atwood in particular.  Based on this the author believes that this
   document is needed to change the assignment policy.
