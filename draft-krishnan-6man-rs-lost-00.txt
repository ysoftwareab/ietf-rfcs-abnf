  IPv6 Stateless auto-configuration issues due to loss of IPv6 Router
                         Solicitation messages
                     draft-krishnan-6man-rs-lost-00

Abstract

   The IPv6 stateless auto-configuration(SLAAC) mechanism allows a host
   to generate its own addresses using a combination of locally
   available information and information advertised by routers.  This
   document describes a failure scenario for SLAAC and discusses how
   hosts can recover from this failure in a properly configured network.

1.  Introduction

   When an interface on an IPv6 host is initialized, To obtain Router
   Advertisements quickly, a host transmits Router Solitication messages
   in order to elicit a Router advertisement from a router.  This
   document analyzes the case where all of these RSs are not received by
   the router due to lack of connectivity at the time the RSs were
   transmitted.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Issues due to lost RSs

   When an interface on an IPv6 host is initialized, in order to obtain
   Router Advertisements quickly, a host SHOULD transmit up to 3
   (MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS) Router Solicitation messages, each separated
   by at least 4 (RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL) seconds as specified in
   Section 6.3.7. of [RFC4861].

   If there exists a switched network between the host and the router on
   the network, it is possible that the host interface may become
   enabled before link layer connectivity to the router is complete.  In
   this case the Router Solicitations sent by the host will never reach
   the router and hence will not elicit a Router Advertisement from the
   router.

   After sending MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS solicitations, and receiving no
   Router Advertisements after having waited MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_DELAY
   seconds after sending the last solicitation, the host will conclude
   that there are no routers on the link for stateless auto-
   configuration purposes.  Hence the host will not be able to obtain a
   global unicast address.


4.  Recovering from lost RSs

   After the RSs are lost, the host assumes that no routers are present
   on the link, and will no longer actively try to acquire a Router.  So
   even if a router appears on the link due to link layer connectivity
   being established, the host will be blissfully oblivious to the
   presence of the router.

   Even though the host is not actively soliciting routers at this
   point, it will continue to receive and process Router Advertisements
   messages as specified in Section 6.3.7. of [RFC4861].

   As long as the router on the link keeps sending periodic unsolicited
   multicast RAs (as required by [RFC4861], one of these RAs will
   eventually reach the host.  If these unsolicited RAs contain at least
   one prefix information option (PIO) with the autonomous address-
   configuration flag set, the host can start using this prefix for
   SLAAC [RFC4862] and it will successfully form an address.  Hence the
   issue is resolved.

   If the RA does not contain any PIOs or it does not contain any PIOs
   with the autonomous address-configuration flag set, it is unclear how
   the host will react.  This scenario, where the unsolicited RAs
   contain less information that the solicited RAs, seems to be
   anticipated and allowed by [RFC4861] where the following text is
   present.

   "Moreover, a host SHOULD send at least one solicitation in the case
   where an advertisement is received prior to having sent a
   solicitation.  Responses to solicited advertisements may contain more
   information than unsolicited advertisements."

   Hosts following the SHOULD recommendation will send an RS in response
   to the received unsolicited RA.  This RS will cause the router to
   send a solicited RA that will contain a PIO with the autonomous
   address-configuration flag set.  The host can start using this prefix
   for SLAAC and it will successfully form an address.  Hence the issue
   is resolved.


5.  Open Issues

   If the router does not sent periodic multicast unsolicited RAs or if
   the host does not implement the SHOULD recommendation for sending an
   RS on receipt of an unsolicited RA, the host cannot configure an
   address using SLAAC.  In the absence of other address configuration
   mechanisms (DHCPv6, Manual), the host will not be able to obtain a
   global unicast address.

   While such router behavior is clearly non-compliant and is unlikely
   to be encountered, the expected behavior of hosts under this
   situation is unclear.  This document has been written in order to
   foster discussion about both existing and expected host behaviors in
   this case.
