Abstract

   This document describes the necessary requirements to allow a service
   provider to extend the reach of pseudo-wires across multiple domains.
   These domains can be autonomous systems under one provider
   administrative control, IGP areas in one autonomous system, different
   autonomous systems under the administrative control of two or more

3. Introduction

3.1. Scope

   This document specifies requirements for extending pseudo-wires
   across more than one packet switched network (PSN) domain. These
   pseudo-wires are called multi-hop pseudo-wires (MH-PW). Requirements
   for single-hop pseudo-wires (SH-PW) that extend edge to edge across
   only one PSN domain are specified in [PWE3-REQ].

   This document specifies additional requirements that apply to MH-PWs.
   These requirements do not apply to PSNs that only support SH-PWs.


3.2. Architecture

   The following two figures describe the reference models which are
   derived from [PWE3-ARCH] to support PW emulated services.

                 Figure 2: PW switching Reference Model


   Figure 2 extends this architecture to show a multihop case. PE1 and
   PE3 provide PWE3 to CE1 and CE2. These PEs reside in different PSNs.
   A PSN tunnel extends from PE1 to PE2 across PSN1, and a second PSN
   tunnel extends from PE2 to PE3 across PSN2. PWs are used to connect
   the Attachment circuits (ACs) attached to PE1 to the corresponding
   ACs attached to PE3. Each PW on the tunnel across PSN1 is stitched to
   a PW in the tunnel across PSN2 at PE2 to complete the multi-hop PW
   (MH-PW) between PE1 and PE3. PE2 is therefore the PW switching point
   and will be referred to as the PW switching provider edge (S-PE). PW1
   and PW3 are segments of the same MH-PW while PW2 and PW4 are segments
   of another pseudowire. PW segments of the same MH-PW (e.g., PW1 and
   PW3) MUST be of the same PW type, but PSN tunnels (e.g., PSN1 and
   PSN2) can be the same or different technology.

   Note that although Figure 2 only shows a single S-PE, a PW may
   transit more than one S-PE along its path.

4. Terminology

   [PWE3-REQ] provides terminology for PWE3. This document defines the
   following additional terms:

     - Ultimate PE (U-PE).  A PE where the customer-facing ACs
       (attachment circuits) are bound to a PW forwarder. An ultimate PE
       is present in the first and last segments of a MH-PW.

     - Single-Hop PW (SH-PW). A PW setup directly between two U-PE
       devices.

     - Multi-hop PW (MH-PW).  A static or dynamically configured set of
       two or more contiguous PW segments (SH-PW) that behave and
       function as a single point-to-point PW. Each end of a MH-PW by
       definition MUST terminate on a U-PE.

     - PW Switching Point (S-PE).  A PE capable of switching the control
       and data planes of the preceding and succeeding PW segments (SH-
       PW) in a MH-PW. A PW Switching Point is never the S-PE and the
       U-PE for a MH-PW. A PW switching point runs necessary protocols
       to setup and manage PW segments with other PW switching points
       and ultimate PEs.

     - PW Segment. A part of Multi-hop PW, which is set up between two
       PE devices, U-PEs and/or S-PEs.

     - PW access point address. A PWE3 payload (special service) is a
       client, while the PSN is a server layer in the client/server
       model as specified in [ITU] ITU G.805 & G.809. The Client layer
       service access the server layer at the access point address.


5. Use Cases

   PWE3 defines the signaling and encapsulation techniques for
   establishing SH-PWs between a pair of ultimate PEs and in the vast
   majority of cases this will be sufficient. MH-PWs are a solution to
   the following limitations of SH-PWs:

        -i. Inter-Provider PWs:  An Inter-Provider PW is a PW that
            extends from a U-PE in one provider domain to a U-PE in
            another provider domain. The need for interprovider PWs
            arises from the desire to use a common or converged packet
            interface (e.g., MPLS) between two provider domains to carry
            multiple services (i.e., IP, ATM over MPLS, etc.).

            It may not be possible, desirable or feasible to establish a



Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 6]

Internet Draftdraft-martini-pwe3-MH-PW-requirements-00.txt December 2004


            PW control channel between the ultimate source and
            destination PEs to establish an an interprovider PW, as
            required for SH-PW. At a minimum PW control channel
            establishment requires knowledge of and reachability to the
            remote (ultimate) PE IP address. The local (ultimate) PE may
            not have access to this information due to operational or
            security constraints. Moreover, a SH-PW would require the
            existing of a PSN tunnel between the local U-PE and the
            remote U-PE. It may not be feasible or desirable to extend
            contiguous PSN tunnels between U-PEs in one domain and U-PEs
            in another domain for security and/or scalability reasons or
            for the fact that the two domains may be using different PSN
            technologies.

            SH-PW setup, maintainance and forwarding procedures do not
            address the various constraints encountered in a multi-
            provider environment. MH-PW setup and maintainance
            procedures must be designed to satisfy requirements placed
            by these constraints.

            An example is the inter-AS L2VPN scenario where the ultimate
            PEs reside in different provider networks (ASs) and it is
            the practice to MD5-key all control traffic exchanged
            between two networks. Technically a SH-PW could be used but
            this would require MD5-keying on ALL ultimate source and
            destination PE nodes. An MH-PW allows the providers to
            confine MD5 key administration to just the PW switching
            points connecting the two domains.

       -ii. PW Scaling Issues:  There is a requirement to deploy PWs
            edge to edge in large service provider networks. Such
            networks typically encompass 100's or thousands of
            aggregation devices at the edge, each of which would be a
            PE. A single hop pseudo-wire architecture would require that
            a full mesh of PSN tunnels be provisioned to allow PWs to be
            established between all PEs. This is not a scalable
            solution. In a network of N PEs, the SH-PW solution requires
            at least N2 unidirectional PSN tunnels to be established
            and managed in the newtork, and at least (2*N-2)
            unidirectional PSN tunnels to be terminated on each PE. It
            also requires each PE to maintain (N-1) PW signaling
            adjacencies, one to every other PE in the network. Thus, in
            a single provider network of 1000 PEs, the SH-PW solution
            would require a minimum of one million unidirectional PSN
            tunnels in the network, a minimum of 1998 unidirectional PSN
            tunnels per PE, and a total of 999 PW signaling adjacencies
            per PE. Interprovider PWs further aggravate this scalability
            problem.



Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 7]

Internet Draftdraft-martini-pwe3-MH-PW-requirements-00.txt December 2004


            If PWs are to be setup between PEs of two provider networks
            with 1000 PEs each, the SH-PW solution would require a total
            of 4 million unidirectional PSN tunnels in the combined
            network, 3998 unidirectional PSN tunnels per PE and a total
            of 1999 PW signaling adjacencies per PE.

            In order to reduce the scaling problem, there is therefore a
            requirement either to support a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels
            and PW signaling adjacencies, or to partition the network
            into a number of smaller PWE3 domains. In either case, a PW
            would have to pass through more than one PSN tunnel hops
            along its path.

      -iii. PSN Internetworking PWE3 signaling protocols and PSN types
            may differ in different provider networks. The ultimate PEs
            may be connected to networks employing different PW
            signaling and /or PSN protocols. In this case it is not
            possible to use a SH-PW. A MH-PW with the appropriate
            interworking performed at the PW switching points can enable
            PW connectivity between the ultimate PEs in this scenario.

       -iv. Pseudo-Wires in Access and Metro Networks Service providers
            are looking to extend PWs to access and metro networks. The
            prime motive is cost reduction in capital and operation
            expenses. For instance, in metro networks, providers are
            looking into extending PWs to next generation SONET ADMs
            using MPLS mechanisms. The objective is to increase the gain
            OBfrom packet statistical multiplexing at an earlier point
            in the network, reducing the recurring costs of SONET
            circuits or maximizing the utilization of existing SONET
            infrastructure.  In access and metro Ethernet networks,
            providers are looking to gain advantage of MPLS mechanisms
            to setup point to point Ethernet virtual circuits with
            endpoints in the same or different access/metro networks.

            If the SH-PW solution is to be used in these cases, every
            edge access or edge metro device with PW endpoints needs to
            beome a PE from the PWE3 architecture viewpoint. This
            results in increaing the number of PEs in a single provider
            network from 100s and 1000s to 10s of thousands, further
            aggrvating the scalability problem discussed in the previous
            section. In addition, if these PEs are to become part of the
            same IGP domain as the rest of the provider MPLS network, a
            routing scalability problem will arise.

            Using the MH-PW solution, access and metro network elements
            need only maintain PW signaling adjacencies with the PEs to
            which they connect. They do not need PW signaling



Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 8]

Internet Draftdraft-martini-pwe3-MH-PW-requirements-00.txt December 2004


            adjacencies with every other access and metro network
            device. PEs in the PSN backbone in turn maintain PW
            signaling adjacencies among each other. In addition, a PSN
            tunnel is setup between an access element and the PE to
            which it connects. Another PSN tunnel needs to be
            established between every PE pair in the PSN backbone.  A
            MH-PW may be setup from one access network element to
            another another access element with three segments: (1)
            access-element - PSN PE, (2) PSN-PE to PSN-PE, and (3) PSN-
            PE to access element. In this MH-PW setup, access elements
            are U-PEs while PSN-PEs are S-PEs. It should be noted that
            the PSN backbone can be also segmented into PWE3 domains
            with more segments per PW.


6. Multi-Hop Pseudo Wire Requirements

6.1. Architecture

   The following requirements apply to the architecture for MH-PWs:

        -i. Client-server transparency MUST be maintained at each layer.
            That is, the PW type (i.e. ATM, Ethernet, etc) MUST be
            transparent to the S-PEs in the forwarding plane, except for
            the functions needed for interworking PW transport over
            different PSN types. (N.B: I added the last two sentences,
            but I still do not like the wording here
             suggest the following:)  S-PEs MAY only support switching
            PWs of the same type. In this case, the PW type is
            transparent to the S-PE in the forwarding plane, except for
            functions needed to provide for interworking between
            different PSN technologies.

       -ii. If MH-PWs are tunneled, using a PSN tunnel overlay, across a
            SH-PW PSN, then only the requirements of [PWE3-REQ] apply to
            the SH-PW PSN. The fact that the overlay is carrying MH-PWs
            MUST be transparent to the routers in the SH-PW PSN.

      -iii. The PWs MUST be transparent to the P-routers. A P-router is
            not an S-PE or an U-PE from the MH-PW architecture
            viewpoint. P-routers provide transparaent PSN transport for
            PWs.

       -iv. The MH-PWs MUST use the same encapsulation modes specified
            for SH-PWs.

        -v. S-PEs MAY change the type or encapsulation mode of a PW.
            This enables the establishment of a MH-PW between two PEs
            with different encapsulation capability.

       -vi. A MH-PW SHOULD be able to pass across PSNs of all
            technologies  specified by PWE3 for SH-PWs. When crossing
            from one PSN technology to another, an S-PE must provide the
            necessary interowrking functions.


6.2. Traffic Engineering

   The following requirements apply to the traffic engineering of MH-
   PWs:
        -i. Upon setting us a pseudowire, S-PEs and U-PEs MUST be able
            to perform admission control for the PW over the PSN to
            ensure that PW bandwidth and QoS requirements can be
            satisfied. Since the PW is tunneled in a PSN tunnel, the PW
            must be admitted at tunnel ingress in the direction of
            traffic.  Restrictions may apply depending on the PSN tunnel
            types.


       -ii. When seitting up a MH-PW, S-PEs and U-PEs MUST be able to
            select a path across the PSN that satisfies the MH-PW QoS
            and bandwidth requirements. Restrictions may apply depending
            on the method used for setting up a PW segment and on PSN
            tunnel types.

      -iii. Bandwidth SHOULD be reserved in the PSN during the PW
            routing phase to support the bandwidth requirements of the
            MH-PW and keep to track of available resources.

       -iv. Mechanisms to protect a MH-PW when an S-PE fails MUST be
            provided.


6.3. Quality of Service

   Pseudo wires are intended to support services (e.g., TDM and ATM)
   which may have strict per-connection Quality of Service requirements.
   This may include either absolute or relative guarantees on packet
   loss, delay, and jitter. These guarantees are in part delivered by
   reserving sufficient network resources (e.g. BW), and by providing
   appropriate per-packet treatment (e.g.  scheduling priority and drop
   precedence) at queueing points.

   In SH-PWs, a traffic engineered PSN tunnel (i.e., MPLS-TE) may be



Martini, et al.                                                [Page 10]

Internet Draftdraft-martini-pwe3-MH-PW-requirements-00.txt December 2004


   used to ensure that sufficient resources are reserved in the P-
   routers to provide QoS to PWs on the tunnel. In this case, resource
   management (e.g. admission control of PWs onto the PSN tunnel) MUST
   occur at the ingress PE. The per-packet treatment for PWs on the P-
   routers and core facring interfaces on the U-PEs will be based on the
   exp bits in the MPLS tunnel header.

   For MH-PWs, each S-PE maps a PW to a PSN tunnel. That is, an S-PE
   decides what PW to bind to which PSN tunnel. Control over binding a
   PW to a PSN tunnel must be provided. Ideally, the PSN tunnel SHOULD
   have better QoS or same QoS characteristics as the carried PW.
   However, in certain cases, an operator may need to bind a PW to a PSN
   tunnel with nominally lower QoS characteristics.

   For MH-PWs, each S-PE may represent a point of contention for
   resources of the PSN tunnels. Therefore, during contention for
   network resources, S-PEs should enable the appropriate QoS treatment
   for packets on different PWs that are multiplexed into the same PSN
   tunnel. Such treatment may be indicated, by the EXP bit values of the
   packet in the tunnel header.

   It must also be possible to reserve sufficient resources at each S-PE
   for the PWs, and to reject attempts to establish PWs on tunnels that
   do not have sufficient available resources to satisfy the QoS
   requirements of existing PWs, the new PW, and other services on those
   tunnels. Such a PW admission control function may reside on the S-PE,
   but it may also reside outside of the S-PE. If it resides on the S-
   PE, then the PW signalling protocol should enable the traffic
   parameters for the PW. PW traffic parameter representations must be
   the same for all types of PW. If an admission control function
   resides outside of the PE, e.g. through a BW broker function, then
   the PW signalling protocol may not need to signal the PW traffic
   parameters.

   Existing services such as ATM often associate different traffic
   parameter values for each direction of a bidirectional connection. If
   the PW signalling protocol signals PW traffic parameters in-band, it
   MUST enable separate traffic parameter values to be specified for the
   forward and reverse direction.

6.4. Routing

   MH-PWs MUST provide the following support national and international
   connections:

        -i. Inter-Area: for different metro and core routing areas.
       -ii. Inter-AS: e.g. between national and international ASs.
      -iii. Inter-provider: for wholesale/transit and for peering
            services where the two ends of the MH-PW are in different
            provider networks.

   In addition, the following general routing requirements apply:

       -iv. MH-PWs SHOULD be routed across multiple S-PEs without the
            need to explicitly specify or configure the S-PEs that a PW
            uses.
        -v. Manual routing SHOULD be supported to allow diversity for
            1+1 protected PWs.


6.5. Signalling

   The following requirements apply to the signalling of MH-PWs:

        -i. At a minimum, manual configuration or provisioning of MH-PWs
            SHOULD be provided.
       -ii. MH-PWs MAY be set up dynamically end-to-end with a minimal
            number of OSS touches.
      -iii. MH-PW signalling MUST provide clear rules and consequent
            indications for successful/unsucessful setup of a MH-PW.


6.6. Operations and Maintenance (OAM)

   PWE3 defines an architecture where attachment circuits are connected
   across a PSN. OAM mechanisms for the attachment cicuits are defined
   in the specifications for those specific technologies e.g. ITU-T
   I.610 for ATM. These mechanisms enable, among other things, defects
   in the network to be detected, localised and diagnosed. They also
   enable such defect states to clear when a fault recovers.

   The interworking of OAM mechanisms for SH-PWs between ACs and PWs is
   defined in [PWE3-OAM]. These enable defect states to be propagated
   across a PWE3 network following the failure and recovery from faults.
   OAM mechanisms for MH-PWs MUST provide at least the same capabilities
   as those for SH-PWs. In addition, it should be possible to support
   both segment and end-to-end OAM mechanisms for both defect
   notifications and connectivity verification in order to allow defects



Martini, et al.                                                [Page 12]

Internet Draftdraft-martini-pwe3-MH-PW-requirements-00.txt December 2004


   to be localised in a multi-hop network. That is, PW OAM segments can
   be U-PE to U-PE, U-PE to S-PE, or S-PE to S-PE.

   It is desirable to use existing PW OAM mechanisms for MH-PWs.

   The following requirements apply to OAM for MH-PWs:

        -i. MH-PW OAM SHOULD be supported end-to-end across the network.
       -ii. OAM activation/deactivation SHOULD be tied to MH-PW
            setup/teardown.
      -iii. The MH-PW client SHOULD support a A Forward Defect Indicator
            (FDI).
       -iv. Single ended monitoring SHOULD be supported for both
            directions of the MH-PW.
        -v. MH-PW OAM SHOULD support switch over between 1+1 protected
            LSPs end-to-end.
       -vi. In-band monitoring SHOULD be provided both end-to-end across
            the MH-PW, and on a segment (i.e. SH-PW) basis.
      -vii. To avoid complex OAM interworking at the S-PE, the same PW
            OAM mechanisms MUST be used on both the ingress and egress
            sides of an S-PE.
     -viii. At the U-PE, defect notifications must MUST be propagated
            between an AC and its
             associated downstream PW
       -ix. At the U-PE, if ACs support directional defect
            notifications, the directionality of the defect notification
            must be maintained when the notification is mapped to the
            PW.
        -x. At the U-PE, defect notifications on a PW must be propagated
            to the associated downstream AC.
       -xi. At the S-PE, defect notifications on the upstream segment of
            PWs must be propagated to the downstream PW segment.
      -xii. At the S-PE, Upstream and downstream PW segments must use
            the same PW defect notification mechanisms.
     -xiii. At the S-PE, defects on an upstream PSN tunnel must be
            propagated to the downstream PWs that originated on that
            tunnel.
      -xiv. The directionality of defect notifications must be
            maintained across the S-PE.
       -xv. The S-PE should be able to behave as a segment endpoint for
            PW OAM mechanisms
      -xvi. The S-PE should pass end to end and U-PE to U-PE PW OAM
            messages transparently.
