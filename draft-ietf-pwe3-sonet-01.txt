   Abstract 
    
   The generic requirements and architecture for Pseudo Wire Emulation 
   Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) have been described in [PWE3-REQ] and [PWE3-
   ARCH].  Additional requirements for emulation of SONET/SDH and 
   lower-rate TDM circuits has been defined in [PWE3-TDM-REQ].   
    
   This draft provides encapsulation formats and semantics for 
   emulating SONET/SDH circuits and services over a packet-switched 
   network (PSN).

   This document describes how to emulate the following digital signals 
   over a packet switched network: 
    
   1. Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE): STS-1/VC-3, STS-3c/VC-4, STS-
      12c/VC-4-4c, STS-48c/VC-4-16c, STS-192c/VC-4-64c. 
 
   2. Virtual Tributary (VT): VT1.5/VC-11, VT2/VC-12, VT3, VT6/VC-2 
    
 
   For the remainder of this document, these constructs will be 
   referred to as SONET/SDH channels.   
    
   Although this document currently covers up to OC-192c/VC-4-64c, 
   future revision MAY address higher rates.

4  CEP Encapsulation Format 
    
   In order to transport SONET/SDH circuits through a packet-oriented 
   network, the SPE (or VT) is broken into fragments, and a CEP Header 
   is pre-pended to each fragment.  The resulting packet is 
   encapsulated in RTP for transmission over an arbitrary PSN.   
    
   (Note: under certain circumstances the RTP header may be suppressed 
   to conserve network bandwidth.  See section 4.4.3 for details). 
    
   The basic CEP packet appears in Figure 1.

4.1 SONET/SDH Fragment 
    
   The SONET/SDH Fragments MUST be byte aligned with the SONET/SDH SPE 
   (or VT). 
    
   The first bit received from each byte of the SONET/SDH MUST be the 
   Most Significant Bit of each byte in the SONET/SDH fragment.   
    
   SONET/SDH bytes are placed into the SONET/SDH fragment in the same 
   order in which they are received. 
    
   SONET/SDH optical interfaces use binary coding and therefore are 
   scrambled prior to transmission to insure an adequate number of 
   transitions.  For clarity, this scrambling will be referred to as 
   physical layer scrambling/descrambling. 
    
   In addition, many payload formats (such as for ATM and HDLC) include 
   an additional layer of scrambling to provide protection against 
   transition density violations within the SPEs.  This function will 
   be referred to as payload scrambling/descrambling. 
    
   CEP assumes that physical layer scrambling/descrambling occurs as 
   part of the SONET/SDH section/line termination Native Service 
   Processing (NSP) functions.   
    
   However, CEP makes no assumption about payload scrambling.  The 
   SONET/SDH fragments MUST be constructed without knowledge or 
   processing of any incidental payload scrambling. 
    
   CEP implementations MUST include the H3 (or V3) byte in the 
   SONET/SDH fragment during negative pointer adjustment events, and 
   MUST remove the stuff-byte from the SONET/SDH fragment during 
   positive pointer adjustment events. 
    
   All CEP Implementations MUST support a packet size of 783 Bytes and 
   MAY support other packet sizes. 
    
   VT emulation implementations MUST support payload size of 1/4 VT 
   superframe fragment, and MAY support 1/2 and full VT superframe 
   payload sizes. 
    
   OPTIONAL SONET/SDH Fragment formats have been defined to reduce the 
   bandwidth requirements of the emulated SONET/SDH circuits under 
   certain conditions.  These OPTIONAL Formats are included in Appendix 
   B.

4.2 CEP Header 
 
   The CEP Header supports a basic and extended mode.  The Basic CEP 
   Header provides the minimum functionality necessary to accurately 
   emulate a TDM SONET over a PSN if a common reference is available at 
   both ends of the PW.   
    
   Enhanced functionality and commonality with other real-time Internet 
   applications is provided by RTP encapsulation. 
    
   Bit 0 of the first 32-bit CEP header indicates whether or not the 
   extended header is present.  When this bit is 0, then no extended 
   header is present.  When this bit is 1, then an extended header is 
   present.  Extended headers are utilized for the some of the OPTIONAL 
   SONET/SDH fragment formats described in Appendix B. 
    
   The Basic CEP header has the following format: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2

    |0|R|D|N|P| Structure Pointer[0:12] |  Sequence Number[0:13]    | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   Figure 2 - Basic CEP Header Format 
    
    
   The above fields are defined as follows: 
 
   R bit: CEP-RDI.  This bit is set to one to signal to the remote CEP 
   function that a loss of packet synchronization has occurred.   
    
   D bit: Signals DBA Mode.  MUST be set to zero for Normal Operation.  
   MUST be set to one if CEP is currently in DBA mode.  DBA is an 
   optional mode during which trivial payloads are not transmitted into 
   the packet network.  See Table 1 and section 8.1 for further 
   details. 
    
   The N and P bits: MAY be used to explicitly relay negative and 
   positive pointer adjustment events across the PSN.  They are also 
   used to relay SONET/SDH maintenance signals such as AIS-P/V.  See 
   Table 1 and section 6.1 for more details.

   Sequence Number[0:13]:  This is a packet sequence number, which MUST 
   continuously cycle from 0 to 0x3FFF.  It is generated and processed 
   in accordance with the rules established in [RFC1889].  When the RTP 
   header is used, this sequence number MUST match the LSBs of the RTP 
   sequence Number. 
    
   Structure Pointer[0:12]: The Structure Pointer MUST contain the 
   offset of the first byte of the payload structure.  For SPE 
   emulation, the structure pointer locates the J1 byte within the CEP 
   SONET/SDH Fragment.  (For VT emulation the structure pointer locates 
   the V5 byte within the SONET/SDH fragment).  The value is from 0 to 
   0x1FFE, where 0 means the first byte after the CEP header. The 
   Structure Pointer MUST be set to 0x1FFF if a packet does not carry 
   the J1 (or V5) byte.

   P : (padding) always set to 0 
    
   X : (header extension) always set to 0 
    
   CC: (CSRC count) always set to 0 
    
   M : (marker) set to 0 for CEP packets. 
    
   PT: (payload type) used to identify packets carrying the packetized 
   SONET/SDH data.  One PT value should be allocated from the range of 
   dynamic values (see [RTP-TYPES]) for every CEP PW. Allocation is 
   done during the PW setup and MUST be the same for both PW 
   directions. The PE at the PW ingress MUST set the PT value in the 
   RTP header to the allocated value.  
    
   Sequence Number : used primarily to provide the common PW sequencing 
   function as well as detection of lost packets.  It is generated and 
   processed in accordance with the rules established in [RFC1889].   
    
   Timestamp : used primarily for carrying timing information over the 
   network.  Their values are used in accordance with the rules 
   established in [RFC1889].  Frequency of the clock used for 
   generating timestamps MUST be 19.44 MHz based on a local reference.  
     
   SSRC : (synchronization source) MAY be used for detection of 
   misconnections.

4.4 PSN Encapsulation 
    
   In principle, CEP packets can be carried over any packet-oriented 
   network.  The following sections describe specifically how CEP 
   packets MUST be encapsulated for carriage over MPLS or IP networks. 
 
    
4.4.1   IP Encapsulation 
    
   CEP uses the standard IP/UDP/RTP encapsulation scheme as shown 
   below. The UDP destination port MUST be used to Demultiplex 
   individual SONET channels.

4.4.2   MPLS Encapsulation 
    
   RTP MAY be directly encapsulated in MPLS as shown below.  To 
   transport a CEP packet over an MPLS network, an MPLS label-stack 
   MUST be pushed on top of the CEP packet.  The bottom label in the 
   MPLS label stack MUST be used to demultiplex individual SONET 
   channels.  In keeping with the conventions used in [PWE3-CONTROL], 
   this demultiplexing label is referred to as the PW Label and the 
   upper labels are referred to as Tunnel Labels.

4.4.3   RTP Header Suppression 
    
   In addition to normal RTP header compression mechanisms as described 
   in [RFC2508] and [RFC3095], an additional option may be used in CEP 
   which suppresses transmission of the RTP header altogether.   
    
   This mode may be used when both SONET Emulation PEs have access to a 
   common reference clock and both support RTP Header Suppression.  
   Under these conditions the following encapsulation formats may be 
   used. 
    
   The choice to utilize RTP Header Suppression may be statically 
   configured using [CEM-MIB], or signaled using a PW maintenance 
   protocol such as [PWE3-CONTROL].

5  SONET/SDH Transport Timing 
    
   It is assumed that the distribution of SONET/SDH Transport timing 
   information is addressed through external mechanisms such as 
   Building Integrated Timing System (BITS), Stand Alone 
   Synchronization Equipment (SASE), Global Positioning System (GPS) or 
   other such methods , or is addressed through an adaptive timing 
   recovery algorithm, and is therefore outside of the scope of this 
   specification. 
    

6  SONET/SDH Pointer Management 
    
   A pointer management system is defined as part of the definition of 
   SONET/SDH. Details on SONET/SDH pointer management can be found in 
   [SONET], [GR253], and [G707].  If there is a frequency offset 
   between the frame rate of the transport overhead and that of the 
   SONET/SDH SPE, then the alignment of the SPE (or VT) will 
   periodically slip back or advance in time through positive or 
   negative stuffing.  
    
   The emulation of this aspect of SONET networks may be accomplished 
   using a variety of techniques including (but not limited to) 
   explicit pointer adjustment relay (EPAR) and adaptive pointer 
   management (APM). 
    
   In any case, the handling of the SPE data by the CEP packetizer is 
   the same. 
    
   During a negative pointer adjustment event, the CEP packetizer MUST 
   incorporate the H3 (or V3) byte from the SONET/SDH stream into the 
   CEP packet payload in order with the rest of the SPE.  During a 
   positive pointer adjustment event, the CEP packetizer MUST strip the 
   stuff byte from the CEP packet payload.   
    
   When playing out a negative pointer adjustment event, the 
   appropriate byte of the CEP payload MUST be placed into the H3 (or 
   V3) byte of the SONET/SDH stream.  When playing out a positive 
   pointer adjustment, the CEP de-packetizer MUST insert a stuff-byte 
   into the appropriate position within the SONET/SDH stream. 
    
   The details regarding the use of the H3 (and V3) byte and stuff byte 
   during positive and negative pointer adjustments can be found in 
   [SONET], [GR253], and [G707]. 
    

6.1 Explicit Pointer Adjustment Relay (EPAR) 
    


  
pwe3-sonet                Expires July 2003                 [Page 14] 
Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet-01           January 2003 
 
 
   CEP provides an OPTIONAL mechanism to explicitly relay pointer 
   adjustment events from one side of the PSN to the other.  This 
   technique will be referred to as Explicit Pointer Adjustment Relay 
   (EPAR).  The mechanics of EPAR are described below.   
    
   The following text only applies to implementations that choose to 
   implement EPAR.  Any CEP implementation that does not support EPAR 
   MUST either set the N and P bits to zero or utilize them to relay 
   AIS-P/V and STS/VT Unequipped as shown in table 1. 
 
   For SPE Emulation, the pointer adjustment event MUST be transmitted 
   in three consecutive packets by the packetizer. The de-packetizer 
   MUST play out the pointer adjustment event when any one packet with 
   N/P bit set is received.   
    
   The CEP de-packetizer MUST utilize the CEP sequence numbers to 
   insure that SONET/SDH pointer adjustment events are not played any 
   more frequently than once per every three CEP packets transmitted by 
   the remote CEP packetizer.   
    
   For VT emulation, a pointer adjustment event MUST be transmitted in 
   all packets carrying a single VT superframe, starting from the 
   packet carrying the V5 byte and not including the packet carrying 
   the V5 byte of the next VT superframe. Pointer adjustment events at 
   the VT and STS-1 levels are mapped to N and P indications. Pointer 
   adjustments at the VT level are mapped 1:1 to CEP indications, while 
   STS-1 indications are mapped according to the ratio of VT/SPE byte 
   rates. 
    
   If both bits are set, then an AIS-P/V event has been detected at the 
   PW ingress, making the pointer invalid.   
    
   When DBA is invoked (i.e. the D-bit = 1), N and P have additional 
   meanings.  See Table 1 and section Appendix C for more details. 
    

6.2 Adaptive Pointer Management (APM) 
    
   Another OPTIONAL method that may be used to emulate SONET pointer 
   management is Adaptive Pointer Management (APM).  In basic terms, 
   APM uses information about the depth of the CEP jitter buffers to 
   introduce pointer adjustments in the reassembled SONET SPE.   
    
   Details about specific APM algorithms is not considered to be within 
   scope for this document. 
    

7  CEP Performance Monitors 
    
   SONET/SDH as defined in [SONET], [GR253], and [G707] includes the 
   definition of several counters that may be used to monitor the 

  
pwe3-sonet                Expires July 2003                 [Page 15] 
Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet-01           January 2003 
 
 
   performance of SONET/SDH services.  These counters are referred to 
   as Performance Monitors. 
    
   In order for CEP to be utilized by traditional SONET/SDH network 
   operators, CEP SHOULD provide similar functionality.  To this end, 
   the following sections describe a number of counters that will 
   collectively be referred to as CEP Performance Monitors. 
    

7.1 Near-End Performance Monitors  
    
   These performance monitors are maintained by the CEP De-Packetizer 
   during reassembly of the SONET stream.   
    
   The performance monitors are based on two types of defects.   
    
   Type 1 defect is defined as: missing or dropped packet. 
   Type 2 defect is defined as: buffer under run, buffer over-run, 
   LOPS. 
    
   The specific performance monitors that are defined for CEP are as 
   follows: 
    
   ES-CEP       - CEP Errored Seconds 
   SES-CEP      - CEP Severely Errored Seconds 
   UAS-CEP      - CEP Unavailable Seconds 
    
    
   Each second that contain at least one type 1 defect SHALL be 
   declared as ES-CEP. 
    
   Each second that contain type 2 defect, or missing packets above 
   pre-defined, configurable threshold of missing/dropped packets SHALL 
   be declared both SES-CEP and ES-CEP.  Default value for missing 
   packet to SES is 3. 
    
   UAS-CEP SHALL be declared after X consecutives SES-CEP, cleared 
   after X consecutive seconds without SES-CEP.  Default value of X is 
   10 seconds.  
    
   Once unavailability is declared, ES and SES counts SHALL be 
   inhibited up to the point where the unavailability was started. Once 
   unavailability is removed, ES that occurred along the X seconds 
   clearing period SHALL be added to the ES counts. An update is 
   required even for closed intervals if  necessary. 
    
   FC-CEP is the number of time type 1 or type 2 defect states were 
   declared.  The NE SHALL have thresholding on ES-CEP, SES-CEP and 
   UAS-CEP (thresholding mean activate a notification if more than pre-
   defined # of seconds are declared as ES, etc. in 15 minutes 
   interval).

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet-01           January 2003 
 
 
7.2 Far-End Performance Monitors  
    
   These performance monitors provide insight into the CEM De-
   packetizer at the far-end of the PSN. 
    
   Far end statistics are based on the RDI-CEP bit. Limited 
   functionality is supported compared to [GR-253] for simplicity and 
   because it is assumed that all relevant statistics are available 
   from the end point of the PW. CEP-FE defect is declared when CEP-RDI 
   is set in the incoming CEP packets. 
    
   CEP-FE failure declared after 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds of CEP-FE defect, 
   and cleared after 10 seconds free of CES-FE defect state.  Sending 
   notification to the OS for CEP-FE failure is local policy. 
    
   This draft does not attempt to define SES-CEPFE, UAS-CEPFE and FC-
   CEPFE, but they can be added if to fully emulate GR-253 far end PM 
   (thresholding is required too here except for FC-CEPFE). (Note that 
   ES-CEPFE is not relevant since CEP does not report back missing 
   packets - only LOPS which is SES). 
    
   The definition of additional performance monitors is for future 
   study. 
    
    

8  Payload Compression Options 
   In addition to pure emulation, CEP also offers a number of options 
   for reducing the total bandwidth utilized by the emulated circuit.  
   These options fall into two categories: Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation 
   and Service-Specific Payload Formats. 
    
   Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation suppresses transmission of the CEP 
   payload altogether under certain circumstances such as AIS-P/V and 
   STS/VT Unequipped.  Service-Specific Payload formats reduce 
   bandwidth by suppressing transmission of portions of the SPE based 
   on specific knowledge of the SPE payload.   
    
   Details on these payload compression options are described in the 
   following subsections.

8.1 Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation 
    
   Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) is an OPTIONAL mechanism for 
   suppressing the transmission of the SPE (or VT) fragment when one of 
   two trigger conditions are met, AIS-P/V or STS/VT Unequipped. 
    
   Implementations that support DBA MUST include a mechanism for 
   disabling DBA on a channel-by-channel basis to allow for 
   interoperability with implementations that do not support DBA.   
    
   When a DBA trigger is recognized at a PW ingress, the CEP packets 
   will be constructed as shown in figure C.1. 
    
   Optional padding bytes may be included if the intervening packet 
   network has a minimum packet size which is less than the DBA packet.

   Figure 9 - CEP-DBA Packet with RTP Header Suppression 
    
   Other than the suppression of the CEP payload, the CEP behavior 
   during DBA should be equivalent to normal CEP behavior.  In 
   particular, the packet transmission rate during DBA should be 
   equivalent to the normal packet transmission rate.

8.2 Service-Specific Payload Formats 
    
   In addition to the standard payload encapsulations for SPE and VT 
   transport, several OPTIONAL payload formats have been defined to 
   provide varying amounts of payload compression depending on the type 
   and amount of user traffic present within the SPE.  These are 
   described below: 
    
8.2.1   Fractional STS-1 (VC-3) Encapsulation 
    
   Fractional STS-1 (VC-3) encapsulation carries only selected set of 
   VTs within an STS-1 container. This mode is applicable for STS-1 
   with POH signal label byte C2=2 (VT-structured SPE) and for C2=3 
   (Locked VT mode). The mapping of VTs into an STS-1 container is 
   described in section 3.2.4 of [GR253] and the mapping into VC-3 is 
   defined in section 7.2.4 in [G.707]. The CEP packetizer removes all 
   fixed column bytes (columns 30 and 59) and all bytes that belong to 
   the removed VTs. Only STS-1 POH bytes and bytes that belong to the 
   selected VTs are carried within the payload. The CEP de-packetizer 
   adds the fixed stuff bytes and generates unequipped VT data 
   replacing the removed VT bytes.  
    
   Figure 21 below describes VT mapping into an STS-1 SPE.

   Figure 10 - SONET SPE Mapping of VT1.5 
    
   The SPE always contains seven interleaved VT groups (VTGs). Each VTG 
   contains a single type of VT, and each VTG occupies 12 columns (108 
   bytes) within each SPE.  A VTG can contain 4 VT1.5s (T1s), 3 VT2s 
   (E1s), 2 VT3s or a single VT6.  Altogether, the SPE can carry 28 T1s 
   or carry 21 E1s.   
    
   The fractional STS-1 encapsulation can optionally carry a bit mask 
   that specifies which VTs are carried within the STS-1 payload and 
   which VTs have been removed.  This optional bit mask attribute allows
   the ingress circuit emulation node to remove an unequipped VT on the 
   fly, providing the egress circuit emulation node enough information 
   for reconstructing the VTs in the right order.  The use of bit mask 
   enables "on the fly" compression, whereby only equipped VTs (carrying
   actual data) are sent.  
    

8.2.1.1 Fractional STS-1 CEP header 
    
   The fractional STS-1 CEP header uses the STS-1 CEP header 
   encapsulation as defined in this draft.  Optionally, an additional 4 
   byte header extension word is added.  The extended header is 
   described in Figure 23.

   Figure 11 - Extended Fractional STS-1 Header 
    
   The following fields are used within the extended header: 
    
        -  R, D, N, P, Structured Pointer and Sequence Number: All 
           fields are used as defined in this draft for STS-1  
           encapsulation. 
    
        -  E: Extension bit. 
    
           E=0: indicates that extended header is not used. 
    
           E=1: indicates that extended header is carried within the 
                packet. 
    
           The E bit in the first word is set to 1 to indicate use 
           of the Equipped Bit Mask (EBM).  The E bit in the second  
           word indicates whether the extended header (to be defined

        -  EBM: Each bit within the bit mask refers to a different VT 
           within the STS-1 container.  A bit set to 1 indicates that 
           the corresponding VT is equipped, hence carried within the 
           fractional STS-1 payload. 
    
   The format of the EBM is defined in Figure 24.

   Figure 12 - Equipped Bit Mask (EBM) for fractional STS-1 
    
    
   The 28 bits of the EBM are divided into groups of 4 bits, each 
   corresponding to a different VTG within the STS container. All 4 bits
   are used to indicate whether VT1.5 (T1) tributaries are carried 
   within a VTG.  The first 3 bits read from right to left are used to 
   indicate whether VT2 (E1) tributaries are carried within a VTG.  For 
   example, the EBM of a fully occupied STS-1 with VT1.5 is all ones, 
   while that of an STS-1 fully occupied with VT2 (E1) tributaries has 
   the binary value 0111011101110111011101110111. 
    

8.2.1.2 B3 Compensation 
    
   Fractional STS-1 encapsulation can be implemented in Line 
   Terminating Equipment (LTE) or in Path Terminating Equipment (PTE). 
   PTE implementations terminate the path layer at the ingress PE and 
   generate a new path layer at the egress PE. 
    
   LTE implementations do not terminate the path layer, and therefore 
   need to keep the content and integrity of the POH bytes across the 
   PSN. In LTE implementations, special care must be taken to maintain 
   the B3 bit-wise parity POH byte. The B3 compensation algorithm is 
   defined below. 
    
   Since the BIP-8 value in a given frame reflects the parity check 
   over the previous frame, the changes made to BIP-8 bits in the 
   previous frame shall also be considered in the compensation of BIP-8 
   in the current frame. Therefore the following equation shall be used 
   for compensation of the individual bits of the BIP-8: 
    
    B3[i]'(t) = B3[i](t-1) || B3[i]'(t-1) || B3[i](t) || B*3[i](t-1) 
    
   Where: 
    
        B3[i]   = the existing B3[i] value in the incoming signal

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet-01           January 2003 
 
 
        B3[i]'  = the new (compensated) B3[i] value. 
        B3*[i] = the B3[i] value of the unequipped VT(VC)s in the  
                 incoming signal  
        ||  =  exclusive OR operator. 
        t   =  the time of the current frame. 
        t-1 =  the time of the previous frame. 
    
   The egress PE MUST reconstruct the unequipped VTs and modify the B3 
   parity value in the same manner to accommodate for the additional VTs
   added.  In this way the end-to-end BIP is preserved. 
    
8.2.2   Asynchronous T3/E3 STS-1 (VC-3) Encapsulation 
    
   Asynchronous T3/E3 STS-1 (VC-3) encapsulation is applicable for STS-
   1 with POH signal label byte C2=4, carrying asynchronous mapping of 
   T3 or E3 signals.  
    
   A T3 is encapsulated asynchronously into an STS-1 SPE using the 
   format defined in section 3.4.2.1 of [GR253].  The STS-1 SPE is then 
   encapsulated as defined in this draft.  
        
   Optionally, the STS-1 SPE can be compressed by removing the fixed 
   columns leaving only data columns. STS-1 columns are numbered 1 to 
   87, starting from the POH column numbered 1. The following columns 
   have fixed values and are removed:  
        
      2, 3, 30, 31, 59, 60    
        
   Figure 13 - Fixed columns removed within T3 mapping to STS-1  
        
   Bandwidth saving is approximately 7% (6 columns out of 87). The B3 
   parity byte need not be modified as the parity of the fixed columns 
   amounts to zero.  
    
   A T3 is encapsulated asynchronously into a VC-3 container as 
   described in section 10.1.2.1 of [G.707]. VC-3 container has only 85 
   data columns, which is identical to the STS-1 container with the two 
   fixed stuff columns 30 and 59 removed. Other than that, the mapping 
   is identical.  
    
   An E3 is encapsulated asynchronously into a VC-3 SPE using the 
   format defined in section 10.1.2.2 of [G.707].  The VC-3 SPE is then 
   encapsulated as defined in this draft.  
        
   Optionally, the VC3 SPE can be compressed by removing the fixed 
   columns leaving only data columns. VC-3 columns are numbered 1 to 85 
   (and not 87), starting from the POH column numbered 1. The following 
   columns have fixed values and are removed:  
        
       2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 44, 48,   
       52, 56, 60, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81

   Figure 14 - Fixed columns removed within E3 mapping to VC-3  
        
   Bandwidth saving is approximately 28% (24 columns out of 85). The B3 
   parity byte need not be modified as the parity of the fixed columns 
   amounts to zero.  
    
   Implementations of asynchronous T3/E3 STS-1 (VC-3) encapsulation 
   MUST support payload length of one SPE and MAY support payload 
   length of 1/3 SPE. The actual payload size are smaller and are 
   described in appendix B. 
 
 
8.2.3   Fractional VC-4 Encapsulation 
    
   SDH defines a mapping of VC-11, VC-12, VC-2 and VC-3 directly into 
   VC-4. This mapping does not have an equivalent within the SONET 
   hierarchy. The VC-4 mapping is common in SDH implementations.

                               |  
                               +----x4---- TU-11 <-- VC-11<---- T1  
        
        
   Figure 15 - Mapping of VCs into VC-4  
        
   Figure 27 describes the mapping options of VCs into VC-4. A VC-4 
   contains three TUG-3s. Each TUG-3 is composed of either a single TU-
   3, or 7 TUG-2s. A TU-3 contains a single VC-3. A TUG-2 contains 
   either 4 VC-11s (T1s), 3 VC-12s (E1s) or one VC-2. Therefore a VC-4 
   may contain 3 VC-3s, 1 VC-3 and 42 VC-12s, 63 VC-12s, etc.   
    
   Fractional VC-4 encapsulation carries only selected set of VCs 
   within a VC-4  container. This mode is applicable for VC-4 with POH 
   signal label byte C2=2 (TUG structure) and for C2=3 (Locked TU-n). 
   The mapping of VCs into a VC-4 container is described in section 7.2 
   of [G.707]. The CEP packetizer removes all fixed column bytes and 
   all bytes that belong to the removed VCs. Only VC-4 POH bytes and 
   bytes that belong to the selected VCs are carried within the 
   payload. The CEP de-packetizer adds the fixed stuff bytes and 
   generates unequipped VC data replacing the removed VC bytes.  
    
   The fractional VC-4 encapsulation can optionally carry a bit mask 
   that specifies which VCs are carried within the VC-4 payload and 
   which VCs have been removed.  This optional bit mask attribute allows
   the ingress circuit emulation node to remove an unequipped VCs on the
   fly, providing the egress circuit emulation node enough information 
   for reconstructing the VCs in the right order.  The use of bit mask

   enables "on the fly" compression, whereby only equipped VCs (carrying
   actual data) are sent.   
    
   VC-3 carrying asynchronous T3/E3 signals within the VC-4 container 
   can optionally be compressed by removing the fixed column bytes as 
   described in section 7.2.2, providing additional bandwidth saving. 
    
   Implementations of fractional VC-4 encapsulation MUST support 
   payload length of 1/3 SPE and MAY support payload lengths of 4/9, 
   5/9, 6/9, 7/9, 8/9 and full SPE. The actual payload size of 
   fractional VC-4 encapsulation depends on the number of VCs carried 
   within the payload. The possible actual payload sizes are described 
   in appendix B. 
 

8.2.3.1 Fractional VC-4 Mapping 
    
   [G.707] defines the mapping of TUG-3 to a VC-4 in section 7.2.1. Each
   TUG-3 includes 86 columns. TUG-3#1, TUG-3#2 and TUG-3#3 are byte 
   multiplexed, starting from column 4. Column 1 is the VC-4 POH, while 
   columns 2 and 3 are fixed, and therefore removed within the 
   fractional VC-4 encapsulation. 
    
   The mapping of TU-3 into TUG-3 is defined in section 7.2.2 of 
   [G.707]. The TU-3 consists of the VC-3 with a 9-byte VC-3 POH and 
   the TU-3 pointer. The first column of the 9-row by 86-column TUG-3 
   is allocated to the TU-3 pointer (bytes H1, H2, H3) and fixed stuff. 
   The phase of the VC-3 with respect to the TUG-3 is indicated by the 
   TU-3 pointer. 
    
   The mapping of TUG-2 into TUG-3 is defined in section 7.2.3 of 
   [G707]. The first two columns of the TUG-3 are fixed and therefore 
   removed in the fractional VC-4 encapsulation. The 7 TUG-2, each 12 
   columns wide, are byte multiplexed starting from column 3 of the TUG-
   3. This is the equivalent of multiplexing 7 VTGs within STS-1 
   container in SONET terminology, except for the location of the fixed 
   columns. 
    
   The static fractional VC-4 mapping assumes that both the ingress and 
   egress nodes are preconfigured with the set of equipped VCs carried 
   within the fractional VC-4 encapsulation. The ingress emulation edge 
   removes the fixed columns as well as columns of the VCs agreed upon 
   by the two edges, and updates the B3 VC-4 byte. The egress side adds 
   the fixed columns and the unequipped VCs and updates B3.  
    

8.2.3.2 Fractional VC-4 CEP Header 
    
   The fractional VC-4 CEP header uses the VC-4 CEP header encapsulation
   defined Section 3.3 in this draft.  Optionally, an additional 12 byte
   header extension word is added.  The extended header is described in 
   Figure 28.

   Figure 16 -  Extended Fractional VC-4 Header 
    
   The following fields are used within the extended header: 
    
        -  R, D, N, P, Structured Pointer and Sequence Number: All 
           fields are used as defined in this draft for VC-4  
           encapsulation. 
    
        -  E: Extension bit. 
    
           E=0: indicates that extended header is not used. 
    
           E=1: indicates that extended header is carried within the 
                packet. 
    
           The E bit in the first word is set to 1 to indicate use  
           of the Equipped Bit Mask (EBM).  The E bit in the forth  
           word indicates whether the extended header (to be defined 
           in future revision of this draft) is used. The MSB bit of  
           word two and three is always set to 1 to indicate that  
           header is extended. 
    
        -  EBM: The Equipped Bit Mask indicate which tributaries are  
           carried within the fractional VC-4 payload. 
    
   Three EBM fields are used. Each EBM field corresponds to a different 
   TUG-3 within the VC-4. The EBM includes 7 groups of 4 bits per TUG-2.
   A bit set to 1 indicates that the corresponding VC is equipped, hence
   carried within the fractional VC-4 payload. Additional 2 bit within 
   the EBM indicates whether VC-3 carried within the TUG-3 is equipped 
   and whether it is in AIS mode.  
    
   The format of the EBM for fractional VC-4 is defined corresponding to
   one of the TUG-3 is defined in Figure 29.

   Figure 17 - Equipped Bit Mask (EBM) for fractional VC-4 
    
   The 30 bits of the EBM are divided into two bits that control the VC-
   3 within the TUG-3 and 7 groups of 4 bits, each corresponding to a 
   different TUG-2 within the TUG-3 container.   
    
   For a TUG-3 containing TUG-2, the first two A and T bits MUST be set 
   to zero. The TUG-2 bits indicate whether the VCs within the TUG-2 are
   equipped. All 4   bits are used to indicate whether VC11 (T1) 
   tributaries are carried within a TUG-2.  The first 3 bits read right 
   to left are used to indicate whether VC12 (E1) tributaries are 
   carried within a TUG-2. The first bit is used to indicate a VC-2 is 
   carried within a TUG-2. For example, 28 bits of the EBM of a fully 
   occupied TUG-3 with VC11 is all ones, while that of a TUG-3 fully 
   occupied with VC12 (E1) tributaries has the binary value 
   0111011101110111011101110111. 
    
   For a TUG-3 containing VC-3, all TUG-2 bits MUST be set to zero. The 
   A and T bits are defined as follows: 
    
   T : TUG-3 carried bit. If set to 1, the VC-3 payload is carried 
   within the TUG-3 container. If set to 0, all the TUG-3 columns are 
   not carried within the fractional VC-4 encapsulation. The TUG-3 
   columns are removed either because the VC-3 is unequipped or in AIS 
   mode. 
    
   A: VC-3 AIS bit. The A bit MUST be set to 0 when the T bit is 1 (i.e.
   when the TUG-3 columns are carried within the fractional VC-4 
   encapsulation). The A bit indicate the reason for removal of the 
   entire TUG-3 columns. If set to 0, the TUG-3 columns were removed 
   because the VC-3 is unequipped. If set to 1, the TUG-3 columns were 
   removed because the VC-3 is in AIS mode. 
    

8.2.3.3 B3 
   Fractional VC-4 encapsulation can be implemented in Line Terminating 
   Equipment (LTE) or in Path Terminating Equipment (PTE). PTE 
   implementations terminate the path layer at the ingress PE and 
   generate a new path layer at the egress PE. LTE implementations do 
   not terminate the path layer, and therefore need to keep the content 
   and integrity of the POH bytes across the PSN. In LTE 
   implementations, special care must be taken to maintain the B3 bit-
   wise parity POH byte. The same procedures for B3 compensation as 
   described in section 7.2.1.2 for fractional STS-1 encapsulation are 
   used.

   This version of the draft does not tie into PWE3 maintenance 
   mechanisms for the setup and tear down of services.  That short-
   coming will be addressed in future revisions of this document. 
    
   Underlying MPLS QoS requirements are not covered by this revision of 
   the draft.  Future revisions may discuss underlying QoS 
   requirements. 
    
   An alternate version of DBA has been suggested that would suppress 
   transmission of the entire CEP packet stream under certain 
   circumstances.  Future versions of this draft may define such a 
   mechanism. 
    
   It is possible to define SONET Emulation specific redundancy 
   mechanisms, such as 1+1 or N:1.  Future versions of this draft may 
   define such mechanisms.

   Appendix A. SONET/SDH Rates and Formats 
    
   For simplicity, the discussion in this section uses SONET 
   terminology, but it applies equally to SDH as well.  SDH-equivalent 
   terminology is shown in the tables. 
    
   The basic SONET modular signal is the synchronous transport signal-
   level 1 (STS-1). A number of STS-1s may be multiplexed into higher-
   level signals denoted as STS-N, with N synchronous payload envelopes 
   (SPEs). The optical counterpart of the STS-N is the Optical Carrier-
   level N, or OC-N. Table 2 lists standard SONET line rates discussed 
   in this document. 
    
    
     OC Level          OC-1    OC-3    OC-12      OC-48     OC-192 
     SDH Term             -   STM-1    STM-4     STM-16     STM-64 
     Line Rate(Mb/s) 51.840 155.520  622.080  2,488.320  9,953.280 
    
   Table 2 - Standard SONET Line Rates 
    
   Each SONET frame is 125 us and consists of nine rows. An STS-N frame 
   has nine rows and N*90 columns. Of the N*90 columns, the first N*3 
   columns are transport overhead and the other N*87 columns are SPEs. 
   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate 
   signal with only one SPE. The optical super-rate signal is denoted 
   as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than OC-N. 
    
   The first 9-byte column of each SPE is the path overhead (POH) and 
   the remaining columns form the payload capacity with fixed stuff 
   (STS-Nc only).  The fixed stuff, which is purely overhead, is N/3-1 
   columns for STS-Nc.  Thus, STS-1 and STS-3c do not have any fixed 
   stuff, STS-12c has three columns of fixed stuff, and so on. 
    
   The POH of an STS-1 or STS-Nc is always nine bytes in nine rows. The 
   payload capacity of an STS-1 is 86 columns (774 bytes) per frame. 
   The payload capacity of an STS-Nc is (N*87)-(N/3) columns per frame. 
   Thus, the payload capacity of an STS-3c is (3*87 - 1)*9 = 2,340 
   bytes per frame. As another example, the payload capacity of an STS-
   192c is 149,760 bytes, which is 64 times the capacity of an STS-3c. 
    
   There are 8,000 SONET frames per second. Therefore, the SPE size, 
   (POH plus payload capacity) of an STS-1 is 783*8*8,000 = 50.112 
   Mb/s. The SPE size of a concatenated STS-3c is 2,349 bytes per frame 
   or 150.336 Mb/s. The payload capacity of an STS-192c is 149,760 
   bytes per frame, which is equivalent to 9,584.640 Mb/s. Table 2 
   lists the SPE and payload rates supported.

   Table 3 - Payload Size and Rate 
 
   To support circuit emulation, the entire SPE of a SONET STS or SDH 
   VC level is encapsulated into packets, using the encapsulation 
   defined in section 4, for carriage across packet-switched networks. 
    
   VTs are organized in SONET superframes, where a SONET superframe is 
   a sequence of four SONET SPEs.  The SPE path overhead byte H4 
   indicates the SPE number within the superframe. The VT data can 
   float relative to the SPE position.  The overhead bytes V1, V2 and 
   V3 are used as pointer and stuffing byte similar to the use of the 
   H1, H2 and H3 TOH bytes. 
    
   Table 3 below indicates the number of bytes occupied by a VT within 
   a superframe.

   Appendix B. Payload sizes 
    
   CEP packets are normally fixed in length for all packets of a 
   particular emulated SONET/SDH stream.  The exceptions are DBA CEP 
   packets and on the fly compression within the fractional STS-1/VC-
   3/VC-4 mode.  When the fractional encapsulation does not carry the 
   equipped flag indications, the EBM to be transmitted MUST be 
   statically provisioned at both ends.  The length of each CEP packet 
   does not need to be carried in the CEP header because it can be 
   uniquely determined for each CEP packet as a function of the 
   provisioned payload size, the type of VTs carried within the STS-1 
   signal, the DBA indication and the equipped flags (either 
   dynamically or statically provisioned). 
    
   The following payload lengths can be statically provisioned for 
   fractional STS-1 encapsulations: 
    
       1. Full SPE length (783 bytes) 
       2. Third of SPE length (261 bytes) 
 
   The actual payload sizes would be smaller, depending on the number 
   of virtual tributaries carried within the fractional SPE.  Figure 21 
   provides the actual payload length as a function of N, the number of 
   tributaries carried within the fractional STS-1. In particular, when 
   all VTs are equipped, the fractional STS-1 full SPE payload size is 
   765 bytes.

   Figure 18 - Fractional STS-1 Actual Payload Size 
    
   The following payload lengths can be statically provisioned for 
   fractional VC-4 encapsulation: 
    
      1. Full SPE length (2349 bytes) 
      2. 8/9 SPE length  (2088 bytes) 
      3. 7/9 SPE length  (1827 bytes) 
      4. 6/9 SPE length  (1566 bytes) 
      5. 5/9 SPE length  (1305 bytes) 
      6. 4/9 SPE length  (1044 bytes) 
      7. 1/3 SPE length  (783 bytes) 
    
   The actual payload sizes would be smaller, depending on the number 
   of virtual tributaries carried within the fractional SPE. Each 
   equipped VC contributes the following number of bytes per SPE: 
    
      Each VC-11       contributes 27 bytes 
      Each VC-12       contributes 36 bytes 
      Each VC-2        contributes 108 bytes

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet-01           January 2003 
 
 
      Each VC-3(DS-3)  contributes 738 bytes (including pointers) 
      Each VC-3(E-3)   contributes 576 bytes (including pointers) 
      Each VC-3(not compressed) contributes 774 bytes (including 
   pointers) 
    
   Figure 19 - Fractional VC-4 Actual Payload Size 
    
   For example, the payload size of a fractional VC-4 configured to 
   third SPE encapsulation that carries a single T3 VC-3 and 6 VC-12s 
   would be: 9 (VC-4 POH) + 6 * 36 + 738 / 3 = 221 bytes payload per 
   each packet. 
    
    The following payload lengths can be statically provisioned for 
   asynchronous T3/E3 STS-1/VC-3 encapsulations: 
    
       1. Full SPE length (783 bytes) 
       2. Third of SPE length (261 bytes) 
    
   The actual payload sizes would be smaller as described in figure 23.

   Figure 8 below shows the same pair of OC12s being emulated over a 
   PSN.  This configuration frees up bandwidth in the grooming network, 
   since only equipped SPEs (or VTs) are sent through the PSN.  
   Additional bandwidth savings can be realized by taking advantage of 
   the various payload compression options described in section 8.
