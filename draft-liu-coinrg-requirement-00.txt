1.  Overview

   Intelligence in the whole industry has a huge demand for computing,
   which put forwards immense challenges to cloud computing and network.
   Network Architecture is undergoing a transformation towards cloud and
   service, providing rapid response and flexible deployment for
   different industries.  Precision and intelligence will be the
   important direction of next generation network development.

2.  Requirements of Network

   Next generation network needs new architecture, to building precision
   network and new ubiquitous intelligence capability.

2.1.  New Architecture

   New Architecture needs to integrate computing into a part of the
   network, so the computing capability could extand as the network.  It
   also needs to use the AI technology to enable network the
   capabilities of self-generating and self-optimizing.  On the one
   hand, the network driven by users and services could be self-
   generating, self-constructing, self-configurating and self-management
   on demand.  On the other hand, the capability and service of network
   could be iterated, optimized and evolved automatically.

2.2.  Precision

   Precision of the network refers to the deterministic of latency,
   packet loss rate and computing resource.

   In the face of time sensitive services such as industrial Internet
   and telemedicine, the traditional network's best-effort forwarding
   mode can no longer meet the demand of such services for network
   latency.  The deterministic latency brings forward a new measure
   latitude for network, which changes from in-time to on-time.

   Packet loss rate is another factor to evaluate the precision of the
   network.  Utilizing the ubiquitous computing capability of the
   network, network prediction and segment-by-segment path
   retransmitting are realized based on AI, network transmission can be
   optimized and service QoS can be ensured.

   Besides those, how to precisely distribute network computing power to
   meet the requirements of business requests is also a challenge to the
   network.  It considers the network status and the performance status
   of computing resources to dynamic match the computing power.  So the
   user experience, utilization rate of computing resources and the
   network efficiency can be optimum.

   Some technologies such as time-sensitive network TSN, deterministic
   network DETNET, etc., have proposed corresponding technical means to
   provide network bearers with deterministic latency(IEEE802.1Qbv,
   IEEE802.1Qbu) and packet loss rate and guarantee the user's business
   experience.  However, it also needs to consider how to guarantee the
   service's end-to-end latency, packet loss rate and resource
   utilization rate.

2.3.  Ubiquitous Intelligence

   Ubiquitous Intelligence refers to use AI in the whole network, which
   could realize the programmability of network, flexible scheduling,
   heterogeneous computing resources and Atomized AI algorithm.

   Traditional IP-based addressing and TCP/TLS session-based network
   model are difficult to play dynamic, micro-service, ubiquitous
   computing advantages, also can't guarantee the maximum computing
   efficiency.Function-based addressing distributes the application
   solution of Server side into the cloud platform.  So the client only
   needs to care about the computing function itself, but not about the
   computing resources such as server, virtual machine, container and so
   on, so as to realize the function as a service.

   Traditional IP network and users can not configure each other, the
   network can not provide customized services according to users'needs,
   and the terminal also lacks the ability to perceive the necessary
   network state.  So it is necessary to open network interface to
   express user's needs and realize network programmability.  The
   network can configure parameters according to users'needs, and users
   can transfer requirements based on network capabilities/states, thus
   effectively supporting future business requirements.

3.  Conclusion

   Under the new business requirements, the existing network technology
   can not meet the needs of transmission, calculation and efficiency.
   Precision and intelligence are the key directions in the evolution of
   network computing convergence.  The new network needs to make the
   connecting reach everywhere, calculation distribute everywhere and
   Intelligence support everywhere.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
