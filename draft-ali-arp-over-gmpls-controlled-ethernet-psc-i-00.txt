                  This document outlines some issues with the use of ARP over GMPLS 
                  controlled Ethernet router-to-router (PSC) interfaces transiting from 
                  a non-Ethernet core, e.g., FSC or LSC GMPLS core. The document also 
                  proposes solutions accordingly.

                    Introduction 
                                  
                  This draft address the scenario where edge routers are connected via 
                  a non-Ethernet switch capable GMPLS core, e.g., FSC or LSC core. 
                  Furthermore, the interfaces between the router and the optical device 
                  (OXC) are Ethernet.  
                   
                  When an LSP Path is established between the Ingress Router to Egress 
                  Router, Ethernet interface at the two routers comes up. However, 
                  before this LSP (or interface) can forward any IP traffic, MAC 
                  address of the remote router needs to be learned. This information 
                  needs to be re-learned, every time the path taken by the GMPLS LSP 
                  changes (e.g., due to re-routing or re-optimization).  
                   
                  Knowledge of IP address of the first component link in the route (at 
                  the Ingress Router) and the IP address of the last component link in 
                  the route (at the Egress router) is required to run ARP over the 
                  GMPLS LSP. If ERO is strict, and the last TE link in the route is 
                  unbundled, Ingress Router can use the computed route to find the 
                  address of the last TE link in the route. However, we cannot assume 
                  that ERO is strict or the TE link are unbundled. Similarly, the 
                  Egress router can use RRO to find the address of the first component 
                  link in the route, if the first TE link in the route is unbundled. 
                  However, use of RRO is optional.  
                   
                  This document proposes an optional RSVP object 
                  (END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR) to carry the IP address of the first 
                  component link in the path in the Path message, and the IP address of

                  the last component link in the route in the Resv message. These 
                  addresses can then be use to resolve MAC addresses at the two end of 
                  the LSP.  
                   
                  This draft also addresses latency associated with running ARP over 
                  GMPLS controlled Ethernet interfaces. Such latency adds to the 
                  traffic switchover delay and consequently traffic loss for 1:1 
                  protected LSP without extra traffic, or when LSP route changes due to 
                  due to re-routing (restoration) or re-optimization, etc. Consequently 
                  This document also proposes an optional RSVP object 
                  (END_POINT_MAC_ADDR) to carry hardware addresses at the two end of 
                  the LSP, in the Path and Resv messages. If END_POINT_MAC_ADDR Object 
                  is used, END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR object is not required.

                    END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR Object 
                
                  The END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR object has a class number TBA by IANA 
                  (of type 11bbbbbb), C-Type of TBD and length of 8.  The format is 
                  given below. The object can easily be extended for IPv6 addresses 
                  (TBD).

                  This object can optionally appear in either a Path message or a Resv 
                  message.  
                   
                  When the first component link in the route (hosted by the Ingress 
                  Router) is numbered, the Ingress LSR puts the IP address of the 
                  component link in the Path message. If this TE link is unbundled, the 
                  address is the address of the TE link in question. If the component 
                  link is unnumbered, the node id of the Ingress router is carried in 
                  the END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR Object.  
                   
                  When the Egress Router receives a Path message with the 
                  END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR object, it adds 
                  END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR object to the Resv message. When the last 
                  component link in the route (hosted by the Egress Router) is numbered, 
                  the Egress LSR puts the IP address of the component link in the Resv 
                  message. If this TE link is unbundled, the address is the address of 
                  the TE link in question. If the component link is unnumbered, the 
                  node id of the Ingress router is carried in the 
                  END_POINT_COMP_LINK_IP_ADDR Object.

                  message. 
                   
                  The Ingress LSR puts the MAC address of the first component link in 
                  the route (hosted by the Ingress Router) in the Path message. When 
                  the Egress Router receives a Path message with the END_POINT_MAC_ADDR 
                  object, it adds END_POINT_MAC_ADDR object to the Resv message and 
                  puts the MAC address of the last component link in the route, which 
                  is host by it (Egress Router).

                  considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol [RFC2205] 
                  remain relevant.
