1.  Introduction

   This draft defines several new block types to augment those defined
   in RFC3611 for use in Quality of Service reporting for Voice over IP.  
   The new block types support the reporting of metrics to a higher
   resolution to support certain applications, for example carrier
   backbone networks.

   For certain types of VoIP service it is desirable to report VoIP
   performance metrics to a higher resolution than provided in the
   RFC3611 [13] VoIP Metrics block or RFC3550 [12] Receiver Reports.
   The report blocks described in this section provide both interval
   based and cumulative metrics with a higher resolution than that
   provided in the RFC3611 VoIP metrics report block.

   The new block types defined in this draft are the High Resolution
   VoIP Metrics Report Block, and the High Resolution VoIP Metrics
   Configuration Block.

   2.1 Reporting modes

   RTCP HR report blocks may be produced by any of the types of RTP 
   systems which are defined in RFC3550 [12] as capable of receiving RTP
   packets, that is, by an RTP end system, by an RTP mixer, or by an 
   RTP translator. For purposes of sending reports about distribution
   quality, a mixer is equivalent to an end system, since mixers 
   resynchronize audio packets before transmission and do not forward
   reception reports from contributing sources towards the destination
   of the mixed output RTP stream. However an RTP translator has RTP
   interfaces in more than one transport-level "cloud" RFC3550 [12],
   participating in the same session, and does not resynchronize audio
   packets in transit between "clouds". A translator may:- 

   - forward RTCP reports generated by RTP systems in one cloud towards
   RTP systems in another cloud, possibly with modification
   - generate its own RTCP reports and send them to one or more of the
   clouds to which it is connected.

   This document defines three modes for reporting by translators. 
   These modes are defined briefly here and described in more detail in 
   section 5 below.

   "End system peering" is a mode in which a translator forwards RTCP
   reports originating from an RTP end system towards other RTP end 
   systems (possibly with some modification consistent with the
   translation which it performs RFC3550 [12]). RTCP reports received
   from an end system are forwarded towards the same destination(s) as
   the destination(s) of the RTP packets received at the same interface
   as that at which the RTCP reports were received. This is the minimum
   which a translator must do to maintain the integrity of RTCP
   communication between the end systems. In end system peering mode,
   the translator does not originate any RTCP reports based on any
   measurements which it may make locally.

   "Local reporting" is a mode in which the translator forwards the end
   systems' reports as in "end system peering" mode, to maintain RTCP
   communication between end systems. In addition, the translator makes
   measurements on the RTP stream arriving at each receive transport
   interface, creating associated RTCP reports. These RTCP reports are
   sent by the translator both towards the source and destination(s)
   of the monitored RTP stream. However, the translator does not forward
   RTCP reports generated by other translators. "Local reporting" mode
   allows translators to assist in localising transport faults, whilst
   keeping RTCP traffic and processing bounded in systems which use
   large numbers of translators.

   "Global reporting" is a mode in which the translator forwards the
   end systems' reports as in "end system peering" mode, to maintain
   RTCP communication between end systems. In addition the translator
   makes measurements on the RTP stream arriving at each receive
   transport interface, creating associated RTCP reports. These RTCP

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

   reports are sent by the translator both towards the source and
   destination(s) of the RTP stream. Finally, the translator also
   forwards RTCP reports generated by other translators, but only
   towards the same destination(s) as the destination(s) of the RTP
   stream received at the same interface as that at which the RTCP
   reports were received. In particular, no RTCP report received at a
   translator from a system S is ever sent back towards S. "Global
   reporting" provides complete transport metrics to every RTP system
   involved in a session. In particular, end systems receive reports of
   measurements made on RTP streams at all receive interfaces of every
   translator. However, the volume of RTCP traffic and RTCP processing
   may become excessively large in systems using large numbers of
   translators.

   In "local reporting" and "global reporting" modes, RTCP reports are
   generated based on measurements made on RTP streams received by
   translators. Typically translators are not able to make all of the
   measurements which an end system is able to make. For example, a
   translator does not contain a jitter buffer so cannot report on
   discarded packets. However, translators may make useful measurements
   of packet loss, round trip delay, and packet delay variation.



   2.2 Cumulative and Interval Metrics

   Cumulative metrics relate to the entire duration of the call to the
   point at which metrics are determined and reported, and are typically
   used to report call quality.  Cumulative metrics generally result in
   a lower volume of data that may need to be stored, as each report
   supersedes earlier reports.

   Interval metrics relate to the period since the last Interval report. 
   Interval data may be easier to correlate with specific network events
   for which timing is known, and may also be used as a basis for
   threshold crossing alerts.

   Note that interval metrics for the start and end of calls may be
   unreliable due to factors such as irregular start and end interval
   length and the difficulty in knowing when packet transmission started
   and ended.

   2.3 Bursts, Gaps, and Concealed Seconds

   The terms Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that of
   RTCP XR (RFC3611). RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts,
   which are periods during which the combined packet loss and discard
   rate is high enough to cause noticeable call quality degradation 
   (generally over 5 percent loss/discard rate), and gaps, which are 
   periods during which lost or discarded packets are infrequent and 
   hence call quality is generally acceptable.  

Clark               Expires December 2006                 [Page 4]



draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

   The recommended value for Gmin in RFC3611 results in a Burst being a
   period of time during which the call quality is degraded to a similar
   extent to a typical PCM Severely Errored Second.

   The term Concealed Seconds defines a count of seconds during which
   some proportion of time was lost through packet loss and discard. The
   term Severely Concealed Seconds defines a count of seconds during
   which the proportion of time lost through packet loss and discard
   exceeds a specified threshold.  

   2.4 Numeric formats

   This report block makes use of binary fractions.  The terminology
   used is
   
   S X:Y, where S indicates a signed representation, 
                X the number of bits prior to the decimal place and 
                Y the number of bits after the decimal place.

   Hence 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0, 0.0039 to
   255.996. S7:8 would represent the range -127.996 to +127.996.

3.2 Header
   Implementations MUST send the Header block within each High
   Resolution Metrics report.

   3.2.1 Block type
   Nine High Resolution VoIP Metrics blocks are defined
  
   mmm   = HR Metrics- Cumulative, Locally Generated
   mmm+1 = HR Metrics- Cumulative, Relayed from Remote IP Endpoint

   mmm+2 = HR Metrics- Cumulative, Relayed from Remote Ext Endpoint
   mmm+3 = HR Metrics- Cumulative,TBD 
   mmm+4 = HR Metrics- Interval, Locally Generated
   mmm+5 = HR Metrics- Interval, Relayed from Remote IP Endpoint
   mmm+6 = HR Metrics- Interval, Relayed from Remote Ext Endpoint
   mmm+7 = HR Metrics- Interval, TBD
   mmm+7 = HR Metrics- Alert, Locally Generated
   mmm+9 = HR Metrics- Alert, Relayed from Remote IP Endpoint
   mmm+10 = HR Metrics- Alert, Relayed from Remote Ext Endpoint
   mmm+11 = HR Metrics- Alert, TBD

   <Authors' note: The number of report types is being reviewed and
   may be reduced to three - Cumulative, Interval, Alert>

   The time interval associated with these report blocks is left to the
   implementation.  Spacing of RTCP reports should be in accordance
   with RFC3550. The specific timing of RTCP HR reports may be 
   determined in response to an internally derived alert such as a 
   threshold violation however the spacing of RTCP HR reports must not
   exceed that defined in RFC3550.

   Note that interval data may be derived by subtracting successive 
   cumulative reports, which provides increased tolerance to potential
   loss of RTCP reports.

   When these block types are used in SDP offer-answer, semantics are
   as defined in RFC3611 [13]. In particular, for "sendrecv" unicast
   connections, a block type in an offer indicates the offerer's wish
   to receive the specified block type. A block type in an answer
   indicates the answerer's wish to receive the specified block type.

   <Authors' note: need to review idea of negotiation of sub-blocks by
   SDP offer-answer?>

   3.2.2 Map field
   A Map field indicates the optional sub-blocks present in this
   report. A 1 indicates that the sub-block is present, and a 0 that
   the block is absent.  If present, the sub-blocks must be in the 
   sequence defined in this document. 
   The bits have the following definitions:

   0 Burst/Gap Metrics block 
   1 Playout Metrics block 
   2 Concealed Seconds Metrics block
   3 Call Quality Metrics
   4 Vendor specific extension block
   5-15 Reserved, set to 0

   3.2.3 Block Length

   3.2.4 SSRC
   The SSRC of the stream to which this report relates.  The value
   of this field shall follow the rules defined in RFC3550 with
   regard to the forwarding of RTP and RTCP messages.

   3.2.5 Duration
   The duration of time for which this report applies expressed in 
   milliseconds.  For cumulative reports this would be the call
   duration. For interval reports this would be the duration of the
   interval.

3.3 Basic Loss/ Discard Metrics

   The Basic Loss/Discard Metrics sub-block MUST be present. 

   This block reports the proportion of frames lost by the network and
   the proportion of frames discarded due to jitter.  

   For sample-based codecs such as G.711, a frame shall be defined as 
   an RTP frame. For endpoints that incorporate jitter buffers capable
   of fractional frame discard the proportion of frames discarded MAY
   be determined on the basis of the proportion of samples discarded.
   If Voice Activity Detection is used then the proportion of frames
   lost and discarded shall be determined based on transmitted packets,
   i.e. frames that contained silence and were not transmitted shall 
   not be considered.

   A frame shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
   implementation-specific time window.  A frame that arrives within 
   this time window but is too early or late to be played out shall 
   be regarded as discarded.  A frame shall be classified as one of 
   received (or OK), discarded or lost.  

   The Loss and Discard metrics are determined after the effects of
   FEC, redundancy (RFC2198) or other similar process.

   3.3.1 Proportion of frames lost
   Proportion of frames lost within the network expressed as a binary
   fraction in 0:16 format.  Duplicate frames shall be disregarded.  

   3.3.2 Proportion of frames discarded
   Proportion of voice frames received but discarded due to late or
   early arrival, expressed as a binary fraction in 0:16 format.

   3.3.3 Dead connection detection
   If no RTP, SID or RTP no-op packets have been received for a pre-
   specified time interval(for example ten seconds) then an RTCP HR 
   dead connection indication MUST be sent.  This time interval may
   be changed during the connection, for example being longer at the
   start of a call.  Dead connection detection may be temporarily
   disabled during silence periods if VAD is used.
   A dead connection is indicated by setting both the frames lost

   and frames discarded fields above to 0xFFFF (equivalent to 
   indicating 99.99% of packets have been both lost and discarded).
   Receipt of an RTCP HR block with either field set to a value other
   than 0xFFFF shall indicate that the remote endpoint HAS received
   some valid RTP packets.

   3.3.4 Number of frames expected
   A count of the number of frames expected, estimated if necessary.
   If no frames have been received then this count shall be set to 
   zero, however if a dead connection is indicated then this count
   shall be regarded as undefined.

3.4 Burst/Gap metrics sub-block

   The Burst/Gap metrics sub-block MAY be present and if present MUST
   be indicated in the Map field.  

   This block provides information on transient IP problems and is 
   able to represent the combined effect of packet loss and packet
   discard. Burst/Gap metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports
   however MAY be used in Interval reports.

   The definition of Burst and Gap is consistent with that defined in
   the RFC3611 VoIP Metrics block, with the clarification that Loss 
   and Discard are defined in terms of frames (as described in 3.3 
   above). To accomodate the range of jitter buffer algorithms and 
   packet discard logic that may be used by implementors, the method
   used to distinguish between bursts and gaps may be an equivalent 
   method to that defined in RFC3611.  The method used SHOULD produce
   the same result as that defined in RFC3611 for conditions of burst
   packet loss, but MAY produce different results for conditions of
   time varying jitter.

   If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration
   shall be determined as if silence frames had been sent, i.e. a
   period of silence in excess of Gmin frames MUST terminate a burst 
   condition.

   The Burst/Gap Metrics sub-block contains the following elements.

   3.4.1 Threshold
   The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in RFC3611, i.e. the number of
   successive frames that must be received and not discarded prior to
   and following a lost or discarded frame in order for this lost or
   discarded frame to be regarded as part of a gap.

   3.4.2 Burst Duration (ms)
   The average duration of a burst of lost and discarded frames.  

   3.4.3 Gap Duration (ms)
   The average duration of periods between bursts.

   3.4.4 Burst Loss/Discard Rate
   The proportion of Lost and Discarded frames during Bursts expressed
   as a binary fraction expressed in 0:16 format.

   3.4.5 Gap Loss/Discard Rate
   The proportion of Lost and Discarded frames during Gaps expressed
   as a binary fraction expressed in 0:16 format.

3.5 Playout Metrics sub-block

   The Playout Duration metrics sub-block MAY be present and
   if present MUST be indicated in the Map field.

   At any instant, the audio output at a receiver may be classified
   as either 'normal' or 'concealed'.  'Normal' refers to playout of
   audio payload received from the remote end, and also includes locally
   generated signals such as announcements, tones and comfort noise.  
   Concealment refers to playout of locally-generated signals used to
   mask the impact of network impairments or to reduce the audibility
   of jitter buffer adaptations.

   This sub-block accounts for the source of the output audio, in
   millisecond units.  The on-time and active speech playout durations
   allow calculation of the voice activity fraction.  The on-time, and
   concealment durations allow calculation of concealment ratios. This 
   sub-block distinguishes between reactive (due to effective packet
   loss) and proactive (due to buffer adaptation) concealment.

   3.5.1 On-time Playout Duration

   'On-time' playout is the uninterrupted, in-sequence playout of valid
   decoded audio information originating from the remote endpoint. 
   This includes comfort noise during periods of remote talker silence,
   if VAD is used, and locally generated or regenerated tones and 
   announcements.

   An equivalent definition is that on-time playout is playout of any 
   signal other than those used for concealment.

   On-time playout duration MUST include both speech and silence
   intervals, whether VAD is used or not.  This duration is reported
   in millisecond units.

   3.5.2 On-time Active Speech Playout Duration (optional)

   The duration, in milliseconds, of the on-time playout duration
   corresponding to playout of active speech signals, if known. If
   not known, then this field is set to all ones (0x FFFF FFFF).

   In the absence of silence suppression, on-time active speech playout
   equals on-time playout (section 3.5.1).

   3.5.3 Loss Concealment Duration

   The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout corresponding to
   Loss-type concealment.

   Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or deletion of samples
   in the audio playout stream due to effective frame loss at the audio
   decoder. "Effective frame loss" is the event in which a frame of
   coded audio is simply not present at the audio decoder when
   required.  In this case, substitute audio samples are generally
   formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to reduce audible impairment.

   Only loss-type concealment is necessary to form Concealed and
   Severely Concealed Seconds counts, in Section 3.6. 

3.5.4 Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration (optional)
 
   The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout corresponding to
   Buffer Adjustment-type concealment, if known. If not known, then
   this field is set to all ones (0x FFFF FFFF).

   Buffer Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled
   insertion or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to
   jitter buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions within
   the endpoint.

   Because this insertion is controlled, rather than occurring randomly
   in response to losses, it is typically less audible than loss-type 
   concealment (section 3.5.3).  For example, jitter buffer adaptation 
   events may be constrained to occur during periods of talker silence,
   in which case only silence duration is affected, or sophisticated 
   time-stretching methods for insertion/deletion during favorable
   periods in active speech may be employed.  For these reasons, buffer
   adjustment-type concealment MAY be exempted from inclusion in
   calculations of Concealed Seconds and Severely Concealed Seconds. 

   However, an implementation SHOULD include buffer-type concealment in 
   counts of Concealed Seconds and Severely Concealed Seconds if the 
   event occurs at an 'inopportune' moment, with an emergency or large,
   immediate adaptation during active speech, or for unsophisticated
   adaptation during speech without regard for the underlying signal, in
   which cases the assumption of low-audibility cannot hold.  In other
   words, jitter buffer adaptation events which may be presumed to be 
   audible SHOULD be included in Concealed Seconds and Severely 
   Concealed Seconds counts. 

   Concealment events which cannot be classified as Buffer Adjustment-
   type MUST be classified as Loss-type.

3.6 Concealed Seconds metrics sub-block
   The Concealed Seconds metrics sub-block MAY be present and if
   present MUST be indicated in the Map field.

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

   This sub-block provides a description of potentially audible
   impairments due to lost and discarded packets at the endpoint,
   expressed on a time basis analogous to a traditional PSTN T1/E1
   errored seconds metric.

   The following metrics are based on successive one second intervals as 
   declared by a local clock.  This local clock does NOT need to be 
   synchronized to any external time reference. The starting time of
   this clock is unspecified.  Note that this implies that the same loss 
   pattern could result in slightly different count values, depending on 
   where the losses occur relative to the particular one-second 
   demarcation points. For example, two loss events occurring 50ms apart 
   could result in either one concealed second or two, depending on the 
   particular 1000 ms boundaries used.

   The seconds in this sub-block are not necessarily calendar seconds.
   At the tail end of a call, periods of time of less than 1000ms shall
   be incorporated into these counts if they exceed 500mS and shall be
   disregarded if they are less than 500mS. 

   3.6.1 Unimpaired Seconds
   A count of the number of unimpaired Seconds that have occurred on
   this call.

   An unimpaired Second is defined as a continuous period of
   1000ms during which no frame loss or discard due to late arrival has
   occurred.  Every second in a call must be classified as either
   OK or Concealed.

   Normal playout of comfort noise or other silence concealment
   signal during periods of talker silence, if VAD is used, shall be
   counted as unimpaired seconds.

   3.6.2 Concealed Seconds

   A count of the number of Concealed Seconds that have occurred on
   this call.

   A Concealed Second is defined as a continuous period of 1000ms
   during which any frame loss or discard due to late arrival has
   occurred.

   Equivalently, a concealed second is one in which
   some Loss-type concealment (defined in section 3.6) has occurred.
   Buffer adjustment-type concealment SHALL not cause Concealed
   Seconds to be incremented, with the following exception. An 
   implementation MAY cause Concealed Seconds to be incremented for
   'emergency' buffer adjustments made during talkspurts.
 
   For clarification, the count of Concealed Seconds MUST
   include the count of Severely Concealed Seconds.

   3.6.3 Severely Concealed Seconds
   A count of the number of Severely Concealed Seconds that have
   occurred on this call.
   A Severely Concealed Second is defined as a non-overlapping period
   of 1000 ms during which the cumulative amount of time that has been
   subject to frame loss or discard due to late arrival, exceeds the
   SCS Threshold.

   3.6.4 SCS Threshold
   The SCS Threshold defines the amount of time corresponding to lost
   or discarded frames that must occur within a one second period in
   order for the second to be classified as a Severely Concealed
   Second.  This is expressed in milliseconds and hence can represent
   a range of 0.1 to 25.5 percent loss/ discard.

   A default threshold of 50ms (5% effective frame loss per second)
   is suggested.

3.7 Delay and Packet Delay Variation (PDV) metrics sub-block

   The Delay and PDV metrics sub-block MUST be present.  This sub-block
   contains a number of parameters related to overall delay (latency),
   delay variation and the current jitter buffer configuration.

   [Authors' note - need to add high and low water marks]

   3.7.1 Network Round Trip Delay (ms)
   The Network Round Trip Delay is the most recently measured value
   of the RTP-to-RTP interface round trip delay, typically determined 
   using RTCP SR/RR. If no measured delay is available then this 
   field shall be set to 0xFFFF

   [Note - potentially add one way delay]

   3.7.2 End System Delay (ms)
   The End System Delay is the internal round trip delay within the
   endpoint, calculated using the nominal value of the jitter buffer 
   delay plus the accumulation/ encoding and decoding / playout delay 
   associated with the codec being used.

   3.7.3 External Network Delay (ms)
   The External Network Delay parameter indicates external network 
   round trip delay through cellular, satellite or other types of 
   network with significant delay impact, if known.  A value of 
   0xFFFF shall indicate that the delay is unknown.
   If the external network is VoIP based then this parameter is
   typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.  If the external network delay
   is known and does not vary materially then this value may be
   provisioned.

   3.7.4 PDV/ Jitter Metrics

   Jitter metrics defined are:

    (i)  Mean PDV - for cumulative reports this is a running average of 
         PDV and for interval reports this is an interval average
         (16 bit, S11:4 format) expressed in milliseconds

    (ii) Threshold PDV - the PDV associated with the PDV percentile
         (16 bit, S11:4 format) expressed in milliseconds, both positive
         and negative thresholds are given

    (iii)PDV Percentile - the percentage of packets on the call for 
         which individual packet delays were outside the Threshold PDV, 
         expressed in 8:8 format. Both positive and negative percentiles
         are given.

   3.7.5 PDV Type
   Indicates the type of algorithm used to calculate PDV:

      PPDV  (0) according to RFC3550, 
      MAPDV (1) according to ITU-T G.1020, 
      IPDV  (2) according to ITU-T Y.1540 
      Other values reserved

   For example:-

     (a) To report PPDV (RFC3550):
         Mean PDV = PPDV
         Threshold PDV = Undefined (FF FF)
         PDV Percentile = Undefined (FFF)
         PDV type = 0 PPDV

     (b) To report 95th percentile MAPDV (G.1020):
         Mean PDV = average MAPDV
         Pos Threshold PDV = 50.0
         Pos PDV Percentile = 95.3
         Neg Threshold PDV = 50.0 (note - implies -50ms)
         Neg PDV Percentile = 98.4
         PDV type = 1 MAPDV

   Note that implementations may either fix the reported percentile 
   and calculate the associated PDV level OR may fix a threshold PDV 
   level and calculate the associated percentile. From a practical
   implementation perspective it is simpler to use the second of these
   approaches.

   3.7.6 Jitter Buffer and PLC Configuration
   Indicates the configuration of the jitter buffer and the type of PLC
   algorithm in use.

              0 = silence insertion

   3.7.7 Jitter Buffer Size parameters
   Current nominal, maximum and absolute maximum jitter buffer size
   expressed in milliseconds, as defined in RFC3611.  

3.8 Call Quality Metrics sub-block 
   The Call Quality Metrics sub-block MAY be present and if present
   MUST be indicated in the Header Map field. This sub-block reports
   call quality metrics and estimates of signal, noise and echo levels.

   Signal, noise and echo metrics should be long term averages and
   should not be instantaneous values.

   3.8.1 Listening and Conversation Quality R Factors
   Expresses listening and conversational quality in terms of R factor,
   a 0-120 scaled parameter in 8:8 format.  The algorithm used to
   calculate R factor MAY be defined in the Voice/Data Quality Metric
   Algorithm block. 

   3.8.2 Listening and Conversation Quality MOS Scores
   Expresses listening and conversational quality in terms of MOS,
   a 1-5 scaled parameter in 8:8 format.  The algorithm used to
   calculate MOS MAY be defined in the Voice/Data Quality Metric
   Algorithm block (see Section 4). 

   Note that R factors and MOS scores may be defined for both narrow
   and wide-band VoIP calls.  R Factors are continuous for narrow and
   wideband, hence the R factor for a wideband call may be higher than
   that for a narrowband call.  MOS scores are scaled relative to 
   reference conditions and hence both narrow and wideband MOS occupy
   the same 1-5 scale; this can lead to a wideband MOS being lower than
   a narrowband MOS even though the listening quality may be higher. 

   3.8.3 R-LQ External In and Out.
     R-LQ External In - measured by this endpoint for incoming 
                        connection on "other" side of this endpoint

     R-LQ External Out - copied from RTCP XR message received from 
                      remote endpoint on "other" side of this endpoint

   e.g. Phone A <---> Bridge <----> Phone B

   In XR message from Bridge to Phone A:-

        - R-LQ = quality for PhoneA ----> Bridge path

        - R-LQ-ExtIn = quality for Bridge <---- Phone B path

        - R-LQ-ExtOut = quality for Bridge -----> Phone B path

   This allows PhoneA to assess 

     (i) received quality from the combination of 

         R-LQ measured at A 
               and
         R-LQ-ExtIn reported by the Bridge to A

         R-LQ reported by the Bridge
               and
         R-LQ-ExtOut reported by the Bridge

   3.8.4 RFC3550 RTP Payload Type

   The RTP Payload type field - as per RFC3551 and
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters

   If the RFC3550 Payload type indicates a dynamic payload then
   it is strongly recommended that the Extended Payload Descriptor
   sub-block (Section 4.4) be sent in order that mid-stream management
   systems can identify the codec type used. 

   3.8.5 Media Type
      Media type - 
                  0 = No media present
                  1 = Narrowband audio
                  2 = Wideband audio

   3.8.6 Received Signal and Noise Levels - IP side
   The received signal level during talkspurts and the noise level
   expressed in dBm0, for the decoded packet stream.

   3.8.7 Received Signal and Noise Levels - External
   The received signal level during talkspurts and the noise level
   expressed in dBm0, for the PCM side of a gateway, audio input
   from a handset or decoded packet stream for an IP-to-IP gateway.

   IP endpoint if a gateway or acoustic echo if a handset or wireless

   The Remote RERL is the echo level that would be reflected into the
   remote IP endpoint from the network "behind" it, and would typically
   be measured at and reported from the remote endpoint. This value is 
   included as it may be used in calculating the R-CQ and MOS-CQ values
   expressed in this report block.

      Local IP side signal/noise metrics relate to signal/noise levels
      from decoded RTP packets received by C from B

      Remote IP side signal/noise metrics relate to signal/noise levels
      from decoded RTP packets received by B from C, and reported by B
      to C through RTCP XR or RTCP HR VoIP Metrics blocks

      Local Trunk side signal/noise metrics relate to signal/noise
      levels from the PCM signal received by C from D

      Local Echo level relates to the proportion of the signal passing
      from B to C to D that is reflected back to C at some point
      between C and D or on the far side of D.  This would typically be
      electrical echo or acoustic echo.

      Remote Echo level relates to the proportion of the signal passing
      from D to C to B that is reflected back to B at some point 
      between B and the user.  This echo level is typically measured at
      B and reported to C via RTCP XR or RTCP HR VoIP Metrics blocks.

3.9 Vendor Extension sub-block

   One or more Vendor Extension sub-blocks MAY be present.  Their
   presence MUST be indicated in the Header Map field. Note that the map
   field does not indicate the number of vendor extension sub-blocks.
   This must be deduced from the length of the overall report block and
   the lengths of the Vendor Extension sub-blocks.

   Each vendor extension sub-block consists of an extension header and 
   vendor-specific extension data. The extension header has the form 
   Vendor ID, Vendor ID Source and Extension Block Length. The Extension 
   Block Length is defined as including these extension header and 
   extension data octets but does not include any subsequent vendor 
   extension sub-blocks.  An implementation can skip over a 
   vendor extension sub-block that it does not understand. 

   The Vendor ID Source field indicates whether the four-octet Vendor ID
   is based on ITU T.35 or is an IANA private enterprise number. The 
   designated values for these options are 1 and 2 respectively. If the 
   Vendor ID Source field is assigned a value of 0, then all of the 
   fields in the vendor extension sub-block with the exception of the 
   Vendor ID Source field and the Extension Block Length field have
   proprietary definitions. 

   If the Vendor ID is based on ITU-T Recommendation T.35, its first two 
   octets either contain a country code from Annex A of ITU-T Rec. T.35
   followed by 0x00, or an escape code of 0xFF followed by a country
   code from Annex B of ITU-T Rec. T.35. The next two octets comprise a 
   terminal provider code allocated by a national assignment authority 
   (http://people.itu.int/~campos/t35/t35db.htm). This field is padded 
   with leading zeros if necessary. If a vendor has multiple
   terminal provider codes in different registries (e.g. the H-series, 
   T-series and V-series registries for the USA), then this provenance
   shall be indicated in the Manufacturer Code Source field. Possible
   values of the Manufacturer Code Source field are:

    0 Unspecified/don't care (may be used if there is no conflict)
    1 G-series registry
    2 H-series registry
    3 T-series registry
    4 V-series registry
    5-255 Reserved. 

   If the four-octet Vendor ID is an IANA private enterprise number, 
   then it is padded with leading zeros as necessary. Current private 
   enterprise numbers (www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers)
   can be accommodated within two octets. The additional two octets
   provide for future growth.

   4.2.1 Block type

   One RTCP HR Configuration block is defined
  
   mmm+12   = RTCP HR Configuration Block

   The time interval associated with these report blocks is left to the
   implementation.  Spacing of RTCP reports should be in accordance
   with RFC3550 however the specific timing of RTCP HR reports may
   be determined in response to an internally derived alert such as a
   threshold crossing.

   4.2.2 Map field
   An Map field indicates the optional sub-blocks present in this
   report. A '1' indicates that the sub-block is present, and a '0' that
   the block is absent.  If present, the sub-blocks must be in the 
   sequence defined in this document. 
   The bits have the following definitions:

   0 Correlation Tag
   1 Algorithm Descriptor 1 
   2 Algorithm Descriptor 2  
   3 Algorithm Descriptor 3 
   4 Algorithm Descriptor 4 
   5 Algorithm Descriptor 5 
   6 Algorithm Descriptor 6 
   7 Algorithm Descriptor 7 
   8 Algorithm Descriptor 8  
   9 Vendor Specific Extension
   10-15 Reserved, set to '0'

   4.2.3 Block Length
   The block length indicates the length of this report in 32 bit 
   words and includes the header and any extension octets.

   4.2.4 SSRC
   The SSRC of the stream to which this report relates.

4.3 Correlation Tag 

   The Correlation Tag sub-block MAY be present and if present
   MUST be indicated in the map field. This tag facilitates the
   correlation of the high resolution VoIP metrics report blocks 
   with other call-related data, session-related data or endpoint data.

   An example use case is for an endpoint may convey its version of a 
   call identifier or a global call identifier via this tag. A 
   flow measurement tool (sniffer) that is not call-aware can then 
   forward the RTCP-HR reports along with this correlation tag to 
   network management. Network management can then use this tag to
   correlate this report with other diagnostic information such as
   call detail records.

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

   The Tag Type indicates the use of the correlation tag. The following
   values are defined:

     0:  IMS Charging Identity (ICID) subfield of the 
         P-Charging-Vector header specified in RFC 3455 [1].  

     1:  Globally unique ID as specified in ITU-T H.225.0 
         (Table 20/H.225.0) [2].

     2:  Conference Identifier, per ITU-T H.225.0 
         (Table 20/H.225.0) [2].

     3:  SIP Call-ID as defined in RFC 3261 [3].

     4:  PacketCable Billing Call ID (BCID) [4].

     5:  Text string using the US-ASCII character set [5].

     6:  Octet sting.

     7-255: Future growth.  

   Although the intent of this RFC is to list all currently known
   values of usable correlation tags, it is possible that new values
   may be defined in the future. An IANA registry of correlation
   tags is recommended.

   The tag length indicates the overall length of the sub-block in
   32 bit words and includes the tag type and length fields.

4.4 Algorithm descriptor

   The Algorithm Type sub-block MAY be present and if present
   MUST be indicated in the map field
   The Algorithm Type is a bit field which indicates which
   algorithm is being described.  The bits are defined as:-

      Bit 0:      MOS-LQ Algorithm
      Bit 1:      MOS-CQ Algorithm
      Bit 2:      R-LQ Algorithm
      Bit 3:      R-CQ Algorithm
      Bit 4-7:    Reserved and set to '0'

  The descriptor length gives the overall length of the descriptor in
  32 bit words and includes the algorithm descriptor and length fields.

  The algorithm descriptor is a text field that contains the
  description or name of the algorithm.  If the algorithm name is 
  shorter than the length of the field then the trailing octets 
  must be set to 0x00.

  For example, an implementation may report:

      Algorithm descriptor = 0xF0   - R and MOS algorithms
      Descriptor length = 3         - 3 words
      Descriptor = "Alg X" 0x00     - description
  
  Call quality estimation algorithms may be defined for listening or
  conversational quality MOS or R factor.

   One or more vendor specific extension blocks may be added, as defined
   in Section 3.10

5. Application of RTCP HR to RTP translators

   RFC3550 [12] defines three types of RTP systems which may source and 
   sink RTP streams. These types are RTP end systems, RTP mixers, and
   RTP translators. For purposes of reporting connection quality to
   other RTP systems, RTP mixers and RTP end systems are very similar.
   Mixers resynchronize audio packets and do not relay RTCP reports
   received from one cloud towards other cloud(s). Translators do not
   resynchronize packets and SHOULD forward certain RTCP reports
   between clouds. Translators have a wide range of possible reporting
   behaviours. This section describes in more detail the application of
   RTCP HR to RTP translators.

   An RTP translator is defined in RFC3550 [12] as "An intermediate
   system that forwards RTP packets with their synchronization source
   identifier intact". RFC3550 gives the following examples of
   translators: devices that convert encodings without mixing;
   replicators from multicast to unicast; and application-level filters
   in firewalls.

   An RTP translator has at least two RTP connections via different
   logical interfaces to network clouds, with logical separation based
   on a transport layer identifier (e.g. by UDP port) or at a lower
   layer (e.g. IP address, Ethernet VLAN identifier, ATM VCI, or
   physical interface). RTP traffic streams flowing via these two
   connections may be unicast or multicast, and may be unidirectional
   or bidirectional. Section 7 of RFC3550 [12] defines the RTCP
   processing in the translator which is required to maintain correct
   semantics for the RTCP communication between the RTP end systems
   involved in the connection.

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

   Where the RTP translator makes its own measurements of the incoming
   packet stream, section 7 of RFC3550 [12] allows it to send RTCP
   reception reports about what it has received. To do this, it is
   allowed to allocate an SSRC and a CNAME for itself.

   An RTP translator has several potential sources of information about
   transport and application quality in a session. These include

      o RTCP (including XR and HR) reports received from RTP end 
       systems and mixers

      o RTCP (including XR and HR) reports received from other 
       translators

      o Measurements made locally on incoming RTP streams at the  
       translators' interfaces

   In general, it is a matter of policy whether each of these types of
   information should be reported or forwarded by the translator towards
   neighbouring RTP systems involved in the same session. The objective
   of this policy may be to ensure that sufficient information is
   available to support network and service management at RTP systems,
   whilst avoiding excessive RTCP processing. 

   Where a translator forms a boundary between service providers'
   domains, a provider may wish to apply policy to restrict the release
   of network performance information towards the provider's peer. This
   suggests that policy controlling reporting and forwarding of RTCP
   information MAY be configurable differently for each network
   interface. This allows certain types of RTCP reports for the session
   to be sent outwards via one subset of the translator's interfaces
   involved in the session, whilst restricting reporting and forwarding
   outwards via another subset.

   <Authors' note: Need to review need for an RTP system to echo
   reception or transmission metrics from any RTCP report back towards
   the RTP system which originated it. This behaviour increases RTCP
   traffic without increasing the information available at any RTP
   system - however DOES make information available to routers along
   the paths between RTP systems, which may be asymmetric.>

   The following behaviours are potentially useful:

     o RTCP [12] reports received from an upstream RTP end system 
      or mixer SHOULD be forwarded towards the downstream RTP end 
      systems or mixers involved in the session. This behaviour is 
      RECOMMENDED to maintain the integrity of the RTCP connection 
      between the RTP end systems involved in the connection. We call 
      this behaviour "a" to aid discussion below of the examples of 
      end-to-end capabilities.

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

     o RTCP XR and RTCP HR reports received from an upstream RTP end 
      system or mixer MAY be forwarded towards the downstream RTP 
      end systems or mixers involved in the session. We call this 
      behaviour "b".

     o The results of measurements made on an RTP stream received at 
      one of the translator's network interfaces MAY be sent out 
      as RTCP reports towards neighbouring RTP systems, either 
      upstream in the direction towards the RTP system which 
      originated the RTP stream (behaviour "c1"), or downstream in the 
      direction towards the RTP system(s) which will receive the 
      translated RTP stream (behaviour "c2"), or both upstream and 
      downstream (described as behaviour "c1+c2").

     o RTCP XR and RTCP HR reports received from an upstream RTP 
      translator MAY be forwarded towards the downstream RTP 
      end systems or mixers involved in the session. We call this 
      behaviour "d".

   In the next section we illustrate how policies may be applied to
   control these behaviours and hence achieve three end-to-end
   reporting modes "end system peering", "local reporting" and "global
   reporting" for a hypothetical bidirectional unicast connection
   using translators. These three modes provide different compromises
   between the amount of information available to the RTP systems, and
   the amount of RTCP traffic and processing. Other modes are possible,
   for example where policy restricts forwarding of reports on network
   performance to another operator, but these are out of the scope of
   this document. 

   To help discussion of these example modes, we name the translator's
   left-side connections to the first cloud as 1T and 1R, where 1T is
   the connection on which the translator transmits packets to the
   first cloud and 1R is the connection on which the translator
   receives packets from the first cloud. Similarly the translator's
   right-side connections to the second cloud are named 2T and 2R.

5.1 Examples of measurement modes involving translators

   The three modes are described with reference to the following
   example, a bidirectional unicast connection which includes two RTP
   end systems A and Z connected through 3 translators J, K and L:

             ----     -----     -----     -----     ----
       |   T|-->|1R 2T|-->|1R 2T|-->|1R 2T|-->|R   |
       | A  |   |  J  |   |  K  |   |  L  |   |  Z |
       |   R|<--|1T 2R|<--|1T 2R|<--|1T 2R|<--|T   |
             ----     -----     -----     -----     ----

   The notation X.nR is used below for the receive interface of RTP
   system X facing a cloud identified by an index n, and similarly the

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

   notation X.nT is used for X's transmit interface facing the same
   cloud. The index n is local to the RTP system, that is, a cloud
   identified as "1" by one translator may be identified as "2" by a
   neighbouring translator, including one connected to the same cloud.

   Where an RTP system is connected to only one cloud (as for RTP end
   -systems), the index n is dropped.

5.1.1 End system peering mode

   In the first mode, called "end system peering", a translator
   forwards RTCP reports generated by end systems but does not send any
   report of its own measurements (if any) to peer RTP/RTCP devices.
   RTCP reports received at 1R are sent out from 2T, and reports
   received at 2R are sent out from 1T. 

   This end-to-end mode is achieved by policy to permit behaviours "a"
   and "b" at all translators involved in the connection.

   Note that translators operating in "end system peering" mode MAY
   make measurements on incoming RTP streams, and MAY report the
   measurements via "northbound" interfaces to management or session
   control systems, but such measurement and reporting is out of scope
   of this document.

   The following illustrates "end system peering" using the example
   connection. In "end system peering" mode, no measurements made at
   translators are sent in RTCP. Measurements made on the RTP stream
   received at end-system A's interface A.R are sent in RTCP from A.T,
   received at J.1R and relayed from J.2T. Following this pattern they
   are then successively received at K.1R and relayed from K.2T,
   received at L.1R and relayed from L.2T, and finally received at A's
   peer, the end-system Z, on interface Z.R. In the reverse direction
   (assuming a unicast bidirectional connection), measurements made on
   the RTP stream received at interface Z.R are sent in RTCP from Z.T,
   received at L.2R and relayed from L.1T, and follow this pattern
   until they are finally relayed from J.1T and received at Z's peer,
   the end-system A, on interface A.R.

   A translator may identify RTCP packets sent by an end system because
   they have the same SSRC as the RTP packets received at the same
   interface. Hence a translator behaving according to "a", or "a" and
   "b", (thus operating in "end system peering" mode) MAY police the
   mode (reducing the load on downstream systems) by discarding RTCP
   packets which do not have the same SSRC as the RTP traffic.

   The advantage of "end system peering" mode is that it minimises
   processing in translators whilst allowing compliance to section 7.2
   of RFC3550 [12]. The amount of RTCP traffic is not increased by the
   introduction of translators into the connection. 

Clark               Expires December 2006                 [Page 27]



draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

  The disadvantage of the "end system peering" mode is that RTP
   systems making up the connection are unable to identify the network
   segment in which an impairment occurred, because the RTP translators
   which form the boundaries between networks do not report
   measurements of impairments to their peer RTP systems.

   Note that in order to be compliant to [12], any processing of
   RTP packets by the translator must be accompanied by appropriate
   modification of RTCP fields such that the RTCP information remains
   consistent with the modified RTP traffic and will make sense to the
   RTP end-system which receives the translated stream. Hence a
   translator's forwarding of RTCP packets may include modification of
   the RTCP.

5.1.2 Local Reporting mode

   In the second mode, called "local reporting", a translator forwards
   RTCP reports generated by end systems, and also sends reports of its
   own measurements for both directions of transmission to both
   neighbouring RTP/RTCP devices (which may also be translators, but
   may instead be mixers or end systems). However a translator does not
   forward reports received from an RTP device which is not an end
   system or mixer. Specifically, RTCP reports originated by an RTP
   end system or mixer, and received at 1R, are sent out from 2T. RTCP
   reports originated by an RTP end system or mixer, and received at
   2R, are sent out from 1T. In addition, reports based on measurements
   made by the translator itself on the packet stream incoming at 1R
   are sent out via both 1T and 2T. Similarly, reports based on
   measurements made by the translator itself on the packet stream
   incoming at 2R are sent out via both 1T and 2T. However, RTCP
   reports originated by a neighbouring translator and received at 1R
   are not forwarded either to 1T or to 2T, and similarly RTCP reports
   originated by a neighbouring translator and received at 2R are not
   forwarded either to 1T or to 2T. In "local reporting" mode, a
   translator must have a CNAME and must allocate an SSRC with which to
   label reports containing its own measurements.
   This end-to-end mode is achieved by policy to permit behaviours "a",
   "b", "c1", and "c2" at all translators involved in the connection.

   For "local reporting" mode, it is necessary to determine whether an
   RTCP report originated at an end-system or at a translator. This can
   be achieved by comparing the SSRC of the RTCP report with the SSRC
   of the RTP packets comprising the traffic stream. If the SSRC of the
   RTCP report is the same as that of the RTP packets, the RTCP report
   originated from an end system; otherwise, the RTCP report originated
   at a translator and should not be forwarded further in RTCP.

   The following illustrates "local reporting" using the example
   connection. In "local reporting" mode, measurements made at

   peering". In addition, measurements made at an interface of a
   translator are sent to both the translator's neighbour RTP systems.

   However, measurements made by a translator and received at another
   RTP system are not forwarded further in RTCP. In detail,
   measurements made on the RTP stream received at end-system A's
   interface A.R are sent in RTCP from A.T, received at J.1R and
   relayed from J.2T as for "end system peering" mode. However for
    "local reporting" mode, measurements made at J.1R and J.2R are also
   sent out from J.2T and received at K.1R. Hence K receives (at K.1R)
   measurements made at all of A.R, J.1R, and J.2R. Of these,
   translator K forwards measurements from A.R out via K.2T. Translator
   K also sends its own measurements made at K.1R and K.2R out via
   K.2T, such that L receives (at L.1R) measurements made at all of
   A.R, K.1R and K.2R. Finally similar processing occurs in L such that
   Z receives (at Z.R) measurements made at A.R, L.1R and L.2R. 

   In the reverse direction, measurements made on the RTP stream
   received at end-system Z's interface Z.R are sent in RTCP from Z.T,
   received at L.2R and relayed from L.1T as for "end system peering"
   mode. However for "local reporting" mode, measurements made at L.1R
   and L.2R are also sent out from L.1T and received at K.2R. Hence K
   receives (at K.2R) measurements made at all of Z.R, L.1R, and L.2R.
   Of these, translator K forwards measurements from Z.R out via K.1T.
   Translator K also sends its own measurements made at K.1R and K.2R
   out via K.1T, such that J receives (at J.2R) measurements made at
   all of Z.R, K.1R and K.2R. Finally similar processing occurs in J
   such that A receives (at A.R) measurements made at Z.R, J.1R and
   J.2R.

   The first advantage of "local reporting" mode is that it permits a
   translator to learn via RTCP the results of measurements made at
   both its neighbours. In addition, it may observe RTCP HR reports of
   the results of measurements made at the terminating end system.
   From this information, a translator has the information which it
   requires to localise a single impairment to one of the locations
   "left of the cloud to my left", "in the cloud to my left", "in the
   cloud to my right", or "right of the cloud to my right". 

   For example, K sees reports from J.1R and L.1R, and also has its own
   measurements made at K.1R. Finally it may observe RTCP reports of
   Z's measurements made at Z.R. Suppose a transport impairment is
   detected at Z.R. If a related impairment is detected at L.1R but not
   at K.1R, K may deduce that there is probably a fault in the network
   cloud between K and L.

   The second advantage of the "local reporting" mode (relative to the
   "global reporting" mode) is that the amount of RTCP traffic on any
   link is independent of the number of translators involved in the
   connection. The total amount of RTCP processing is proportional to
   the number of translators but this processing is distributed among
   the translators. Hence the mode scales to large numbers of
   translators, for unicast connections.

5.1.3 Global Reporting mode

   In the third mode, called "global reporting", measurements made at
   end-systems are forwarded along the whole chain, as for "end system
   peering". In addition, measurements made at an interface of a
   translator are sent to both the translator's neighbour RTP systems.
   Measurements made by a translator and received at another translator
   are also forwarded further in RTCP, but only in the direction away
   from the source of the measurement - that is, information received
   over RTCP from one cloud is sent to the other but is not copied back
   to any RTP system in the cloud which sent the measurement. In
   "global reporting" mode, a translator must have a CNAME and must
   allocate an SSRC with which to label reports containing its own
   measurements. Specifically, RTCP reports originated by an RTP end
   system or mixer, and received at 1R, are sent out from 2T. RTCP
   reports originated by an RTP end system or mixer, and received at
   2R, are sent out from 1T. In addition, reports based on measurements
   made by the translator itself on the packet stream incoming at 1R
   and 2R are sent out via both 1T and 2T. In addition, RTCP reports
   either originated or forwarded by a neighbouring translator and
   received at 1R are forwarded out via 2T, and similarly RTCP reports
   either originated or forwarded by a neighbouring translator and
   received at 2R are forwarded out via 1T.

   This end-to-end mode is achieved by policy to permit behaviours "a",
   "b", "c1", "c2", and "d" at all translators involved in the
   connection. 

   The following illustrates "global reporting" using the example
   connection. Measurements made on the RTP stream received at
   end-system A's interface A.R are sent in RTCP from A.T, received at
   J.1R and relayed from J.2T as for "end system peering" mode. However
   for "global reporting" mode, measurements made at J.1R and J.2R are
   also sent out from J.2T and received at K.1R. Hence K receives (at
   K.1R) measurements made at all of A.R, J.1R, and J.2R. Translator K
   forwards all of these measurements out via K.2T. Translator K also
   sends its own measurements made at K.1R and K.2R out via K.2T, such
   that L receives (at L.1R) measurements made at all of A.R, J.1R,
   J.2R, K.1R and K.2R. Finally similar processing occurs in L such
   that Z receives (at Z.R) measurements made at A.R, J.1R, J.2R, K.1R,
   K.2R, L.1R and L.2R. 

   In the reverse direction, measurements made on the RTP stream
   received at end-system Z's interface Z.R are sent in RTCP from Z.T,
   received at L.2R and relayed from L.1T as for "end system peering"
   mode. However for "global reporting" mode, measurements made at
   L.1R and L.2R are also sent out from L.1T and received at K.2R.
   Hence K receives (at K.2R) measurements made at all of Z.R, L.1R,
   and L.2R. Translator K forwards all of these measurements out via
   K.1T. Translator K also sends its own measurements made at K.1R and
   K.2R out via K.1T, such that J receives (at J.2R) measurements made

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

   at all of Z.R, L.1R, L.2R, K.1R and K.2R. Finally similar processing
   occurs in J such that A receives (at A.R) measurements made at Z.R,
   L.1R, L.2R, K.1R, K.2R, J.1R and J.2R.

   In "global reporting" mode, all RTCP packets received at an incoming
   interface should be assumed to be either from an end system or from
   a translator on the path from the end system, and should be
   forwarded.

   The advantage of the "global reporting" mode is that every RTP
   system (translators and end-systems) has access to all the
   information to allow localisation of impairments to the faulty
   cloud.

   The disadvantage of the "global reporting" mode is that the amount
   of RTCP traffic on every link is proportional to the number of
   translators in the connection, and the total amount of RTCP
   processing, though distributed among translators, is proportional to
   the square of the number of translators. Hence the "global
   reporting" mode does not scale well for connections which may
   involve large numbers of translators.

5.1.4 Summary of operating modes

   End System Peering - Measurements are made on received RTP streams
   at RTP endpoints and relayed via translators.  Any measurements made
   by translators are not forwarded but MAY be sent "northbound" (out
   of scope of this document).

       Advantages - Minimises translator processing.  RTCP traffic is
       not increased by additional translators.

       Disadvantages - RTP systems are unable to identify where
       impairments are occurring.

   Local mode - Translators forward end system reports (End System
   Peering), and also send reports of their own measurements to their
   neighbours.  They do not forward reports from other translators or
   mixers.

       Advantages - Allows the translator to learn the results of
       neighbour measurements via RTCP.  RTCP traffic is independent
       of the number of translators.
       RTCP traffic processing is proportional to the number of
       translators, but processing is distributed, so this mode scales
       better than Global mode.

draft-clark-avt-rtcphr-02.txt                               June 2005 

       Disadvantages - Not all RTP systems have access to all the
       information, so this mode is less powerful than Global mode
       for impairment localisation.

   Global mode Translators forward both end system reports (End System
   Peering) and measurements sent from a neighbour translator, but only
   in the direction away from the measurement source.  Measurements
   made at a translator interface are also sent to both the
   translator's neighbour systems.  

       Advantages - Every RTP system (translators and end-systems) has
       access to all the information to allow impairment localisation.

       Disadvantages - RTCP traffic in every link is proportional to
       the number of translators in the connection.  The total RTCP
       processing is proportional to the square of the number of
       translators.

9.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.
