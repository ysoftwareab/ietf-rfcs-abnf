1. Introduction

   Home network interconnects a number of home devices with wireline or
   wireless access technology. Home network may include a diverse range
   of devices, e.g. multimedia devices, smart appliances, laptops,
   network gateways. Therefore it is necessary to design a management
   system for the home network to enable remote control, energy
   management and data sharing.

   o HTTP     HyperText Transfer Protocol

3. General Framework

3.1. General requirements

   This specification includes two aspects in home network: device
   access control and device interconnection.

   o Device access control provides a unified and flexible platform for
     the home network, which can manage device access in a large-scale
     home network and deal with a wide range of access protocols.

   o Device interconnection is based on the home network platform, and
     supports the identification of different devices, the transmission
     and processing of data and control messages among the
     interconnected devices.

4. Device access control

4.1. Design requirements

   o Home network devices can connect to the platform through various
     wireless or wireline access protocols(for example, Cable,
     Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee). The platform needs to manage the
     devices through different network interfaces. When the home
     network devices join the home network, the platform can
     automatically provide authentication and configuration.
     Furthermore, it can report errors or exceptions when a device
     cannot work properly. In summary, the platform provides a unified
     portal to manage and control the devices.

   o The platform also provides flexible application layer interfaces
     for the applications. The interfaces implement device
     identification, routing, addressing, management, and other
     functions. Application developers thus can design and deploy
     relevant applications without concerning about the underlying
     details.

4.2.1 Private logical link protocol

   o Twisted pair system using the EIA-485 protocol.

   o The frame length of communication protocol is less than 64 bytes.

4.2.2 Control network mapping protocol (CNMP)

   o Mapping between upper layer and lower layer protocol. This protocol
   is based on DNCP [RFC7787].

4.2.3 Variable secure operation protocol (VSOP)

   o According to the complexity of the security operation protocol,
     the security operation protocol is divided into different levels.

4.2.4 Device description protocol

   o The description should include device status variables.

   o Device description can be obtained through the two-dimensional QR
      code.

4.2.5 Device discovery protocol

   o The home network devices are discovered by mDNS protocol or SSDP
      protocol.

   o Bus device can use CNMP scanning.

4.3. Communication protocols between devices

   The following protocols are supported:

   o ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

   o Bluetooth standard.

   o NFC ISO/IEC IS 18092 international standard, EMCA-340 standard,
      and ETSI TS 102 190 standard.

   o WIFI/IEEE 802.11 standard.

   o ITU-G.hn and IEEE1901 standard.

   o 100/1000Mbps Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 standard.

4.4. Functional Description of home network devices

4.4.1 Classification of devices

   The functional classification of home devices are as follows:

   o According to the control mode (input), home network devices can
     be divided into on-off state controller and range controller.

   o According to the functions (output), home network devices can
     have on-off state output, numerical result output and complex
     data output.

   Typical devices are listed in Figure 2 (a device may belong to more
   than one types) and the functional characteristics of each type are
   as Figure 3.

    +------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
    |-------Category---------|-------------- Typical devices ----------|
    +------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
    |--On-Off control class--|----- smart socket, smart lighting,------|
    |------------------------|------------smart remote control---------|

5. Home network device interconnection

   Devices interconnection includes configuration management and
   authentication management.

   o Configuration management: According to the data model supported
     by platform and home network devices, different management
     functions are provided including configuration status detection,
     device activation, logout, and status management.

   o Authentication management: Home network devices send the
     registration information, such as ID number, device type,
     supported communication mode to the platform. The platform then
     deals with data of the devices which have successfully passed the
     authentication.

5.1. Discovery and query protocol between devices

   o After the home network devices are connected, the home gateway
     can name, describe and query the devices by mDNS or DNS-SD. mDNS
     mainly enable the mutual discovery and communication among hosts
     in the local area network. And mDNS works under the absence of
     traditional DNS server.

   o The gateway also supports the discovery and query with UPnP.

5.2. The description of home network devices

5.2.1 The description definition of devices

   o The description includes device properties and device serices.

   o Device properties can be divided into read-only and writable.
     Read-only property is related to the data produced by itself
     (such as the data of air quality provided by air sensor devices).
     While writable property is corresponding to the management of
     device status (such as the brightness control function provided
     by LED lighting device).

   o Device services are the functions provided by the home network
     devices (such as the function of playing video provided by TV).

5.2.2 The document format of device description

   o The description of home network devices can be expressed as the
     following ways: XML, JSON, and binary document format. XML
     document format can be the default format for home network device
     description.

6. Security Considerations

   This document describes the implementation of a multi-protocol
   multi-device home interconnection scheme. There may be security
   issues in the platform, such as malicious users, which may lead to
   excessive load of platform.

   Malicious users can not be allowed to send messages frequently.
   Therefore, the techniques of authentication and abnormal user
   detection can be considered.
   
   As the same time, we need to enrypt users' privacies.Devices use 
   the MD5 algorithm [RFC1321] to encrypt informations that will be 
   transported.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document does not consider the IANA.
