Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,
   configuring, and testing the data-link connection.  This document     |
   defines additional LCP features that have been suggested over the
   past few years.

1.  Additional LCP Packets

   The Packet format and basic facilities are already defined for LCP
   [1].

   Up-to-date values of the LCP Code field are specified in the most
   recent "Assigned Numbers" [2].  This document concerns the following
   values:

      12      Identification
      13      Time-Remaining



1.1.  Identification

   Description

      This Code provides a method for an implementation to identify
      itself to its peer.  This Code might be used for many diverse pur-
      poses, such as link troubleshooting, license enforcement, etc.

      Identification is a Link Maintenance packet.  Identification pack-
      ets MAY be sent at any time, including before LCP has reached the
      Opened state.

      The sender transmits a LCP packet with the Code field set to 12
      (Identification), the Identifier field set, the local Magic-Number
      (if any) inserted, and the Message field filled with any desired
      data, but not exceeding the default MRU minus eight.

      Receipt of an Identification packet causes the RXR or RUC event.
      There is no response to the Identification packet.

      Receipt of a Code-Reject for the Identification packet SHOULD gen-
      erate the RXJ+ (permitted) event.

   Rationale:

      This feature is defined as part of LCP, rather than as a separate
      PPP Protocol, in order that its benefits may be available during
      the earliest possible stage of the Link Establishment phase.  It
      allows an operator to learn the identification of the peer even
      when negotiation is not converging.  Non-LCP packets cannot be
      sent during the Link Establishment phase.

      This feature is defined as a separate LCP Code, rather than a Con-
      figuration-Option, so that the peer need not include it with other

      items in configuration packet exchanges, and handle "corrected"
      values or "rejection", since its generation is both rare and in
      one direction.  It is recommended that Identification packets be
      sent whenever a Configure-Reject is sent or received, as a final
      message when negotiation fails to converge, and when LCP reaches
      the Opened state.

   A summary of the Identification packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Code

      12 for Identification

   Identifier

      The Identifier field MUST be changed for each Identification sent.

   Length

      >= 8

   Magic-Number

      The Magic-Number field is four octets and aids in detecting links
      which are in the looped-back condition.  Until the Magic-Number
      Configuration Option has been successfully negotiated, the Magic-
      Number MUST be transmitted as zero.  See the Magic-Number Configu-
      ration Option for further explanation.

   Message

      The Message field is zero or more octets, and its contents are
      implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable,
      and MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is recommended
      that the message contain displayable ASCII characters 32 through
      126 decimal.  Mechanisms for extension to other character sets are
      the topic of future research.  The size is determined from the

      Length field.

      Implementation Note:

         The Message will usually contain such things as the sender's
         hardware type, PPP software revision level, and PPP product
         serial number, MIB information such as link speed and interface
         name, and any other information that the sender thinks might be
         useful in debugging connections.  The format is likely to be
         different for each implementor, so that those doing serial num-
         ber tracking can validate their numbers.  A robust implementa-
         tion SHOULD treat the Message as displayable text, and SHOULD   |
         be able to receive and display a full MRU length Message.


1.2.  Time-Remaining

   Description

      This Code provides a mechanism for notifying the peer of the time
      remaining in this session.

      The nature of this information is advisory only.  It is intended
      that only one side of the connection will send this packet (gener-
      ally a "network access server").  The session is actually con-
      cluded by the Terminate-Request packet.

      Time-Remaining is a Link Maintenance packet.  Time-Remaining pack-
      ets may only be sent in the LCP Opened state.

      The sender transmits a LCP packet with the Code field set to 13
      (Time-Remaining), the Identifier field set, the local Magic-Number
      (if any) inserted, and the Message field filled with any desired
      data, but not exceeding the peer's established MRU minus twelve.

      Receipt of an Time-Remaining packet causes the RXR or RUC event.
      There is no response to the Time-Remaining packet.

      Receipt of a Code-Reject for the Time-Remaining packet SHOULD gen-
      erate the RXJ+ (permitted) event.

   Rationale:

      This notification is defined as a separate LCP Code, rather than a
      Configuration-Option, in order that changes and warning messages
      may occur dynamically during the session, and that the information
      might be determined after Authentication has occurred.  Typically,
      this packet is sent when the link enters Network-Layer Protocol

      phase, and at regular intervals throughout the session, particu-
      larly near the end of the session.

   A summary of the Time-Remaining packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Code

      13 for Time-Remaining

   Identifier

      The Identifier field MUST be changed for each Time-Remaining sent.

   Length

      >= 12

   Magic-Number

      The Magic-Number field is four octets and aids in detecting links
      which are in the looped-back condition.  Until the Magic-Number
      Configuration Option has been successfully negotiated, the Magic-
      Number MUST be transmitted as zero.  See the Magic-Number Configu-
      ration Option for further explanation.

   Seconds-Remaining

      The Seconds-Remaining field is four octets and indicates the num-
      ber of integral seconds remaining in this session.  This 32 bit
      unsigned value is sent most significant octet first.  A value of
      0xffffffff (all ones) represents no timeout, or "forever".

   Message

      The Message field is zero or more octets, and its contents are
      implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable,
      and MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is recommended
      that the message contain displayable ASCII characters 32 through
      126 decimal.  Mechanisms for extension to other character sets are
      the topic of future research.  The size is determined from the
      Length field.
