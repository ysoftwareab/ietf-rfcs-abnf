1.  Introduction

   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP, [RFC6830] ) base
   specification defines a set of primitives that are identified with a
   packet type code.  Several extensions have been proposed to add more
   LISP functionalities.  For example, new message types are proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-ddt], [I-D.zhao-lisp-mn-extension],
   [I-D.boucadair-lisp-bulk], [I-D.boucadair-lisp-subscribe], or
   [I-D.boucadair-lisp-ms-assisted-forwarding].  It is expected that
   additional LISP extensions will be proposed in the future.

   In order to ease the tracking of LISP message types, this document
   proposes to create a "LISP Packet Types" IANA registry (see
   Section 4).

   Because of the limited type space [RFC6830], this document specifies
   a shared LISP message type for experimentation purposes and proposes
   a procedure for registering LISP experiment identifiers (see
   Section 2) that make use of additional LISP capabilities associated
   with this message type.  Concretely, one single LISP message type
   code is dedicated to experiments; experiment IDs are used to uniquely
   identify a given LISP experimental message.  These identifiers are
   selected by the author(s) of the corresponding LISP specification
   that introduces a new experimental message type.

2.  LISP Message Type for Experimentations

   Figure 1 depicts a common LISP experimental message type.  The type
   field MUST be set to 15 (see Section 4).

   The "Experiment ID" field conveys a unique identifier that is
   assigned on a First Come, First Served (FCFS) basis [RFC5226].  These
   identifiers are registered with IANA (see Section 4.1).

   The exact structure of the 'experiment-specific' portion of the
   message is specified in the corresponding specification document.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC6830].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new protocol registry for LISP Packet
   Types, numbered 0-15.  The registry must be initially populated with
   the following values ([RFC6830]):

          Message                           Code
          ================================= ====
          Reserved                           0
          LISP Map-Request                   1
          LISP Map-Reply                     2
          LISP Map-Register                  3
          LISP Map-Notify                    4
          LISP Encapsulated Control Message  8
          LISP Experimental Message         15

   The values in the ranges 5-7 and 9-14 can be assigned via Standards
   Action [RFC5226].

   The value 15 is reserved for Experimental Use [RFC5226].

4.1.  Experiment IDs

   IANA is requested to create a "LISP Experimental Message Experiment
   Identifiers" registry.

   Entries are assigned on a First Come, First Served (FCFS) basis
   [RFC5226].

   IANA should impose no requirements on making a registration other
   than indicating the desired experiment ID and providing a point of
   contact.  Providing a short description (together with an acronym, if
   relevant) of the foreseen usage of the experimental message is
   encouraged.

5.  Acknowledgments

   This work is partly funded by ANR LISP-Lab project #ANR-13-INFR-
   009-X.

   The shared experiment ID is inspired by [RFC6994].
