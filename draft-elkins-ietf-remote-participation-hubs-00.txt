                       Remote Participation Hubs
             draft-elkins-ietf-remote-participation-hubs-00

Abstract

For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has increased.  
As the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide.
Remote participation with more than one person is considered a hub.

Three types of remote participation hubs are defined.   Each has its own
characteristics.

   - Remote Participation Hubs
   - Remote Viewing Hubs
   - Enduring Local Meetups

This document defines a Remote Participation Hub (RPH).  Other documents
define the other types of hubs.  A common structure of sections will be
used as far as possible for all hub types.

1  Introduction

   For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has
   increased.   As the Internet grows, so does the participation by
   engineers worldwide. Remote participation with more than one person
   is considered a hub.

   Three types of remote participation hubs are defined.   Each has its
   own characteristics.

   - Remote Participation Hubs (RPH)
   - Remote Viewing Hubs (RVH)
   - Enduring Local Meetups (ELM)

   This document defines the nature of a Remote Participation Hub.   A
   Remote Participation Hub is functionally equivalent to an IETF face-
   to-face meeting.   A Remote Viewing Hub is less restrictive and may
   be used for outreach purposes.  If an attendee at a Remote Viewing
   Hub wishes to participate in a working group session, the attendee
   may do so as an individual remote participant.   An Enduring Local
   Meetup is not necessarily at the same time as an IETF face-to-face
   meeting and may do activities at its own discretion.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Purpose of Remote Participation Hubs (RPH)

   The purpose of a Remote Participation Hubs (RPH) is to provide a
   gathering space to participate in one or more Working Groups
   sessions, Hackathons, or IETF Plenaries scheduled at an ongoing IETF
   meeting which is being held at the same time.   

   Participation in an RPH is to be considered as functionally
   equivalent to attendance at an IETF meeting face-to-face. This means
   that all legal and session management procedures must be followed
   (including NOTE-WELL and blue sheets).  The specific details will be
   covered in the relevant section below. 

   One or more onsite coordinators MUST be present.

3  Relationship to IETF Meetings

   The RPH will be at the time of the IETF meeting.  An RPH may decide
   to have multiple rooms with multiple simultaneous sessions mirroring

INTERNET DRAFTdraft-elkins-ietf-remote-participation-hubs-00June 15, 2017


   those at the face-to-face meeting or it may choose to have a single
   room with selected Working Group sessions. This is at the discretion
   of the RPH.   The sessions to be held at the RPH must be communicated
   to the IETF Secretariat for posting in the Wiki. 

   It SHOULD also mention any restrictions such as:

   1.  Only employees of the hosting organization are allowed
   2.  Restrictions on carrying laptops or recording devices
   3.  Specific proof of identity required to access the premises

3.1  Registration

   An attendee at an RPH MUST register and this must be noted by the
   IETF Secretariat.   This MUST be checked by the onsite co-ordinator.

   There may be an online attendance portal having blue sheets provided
   by IETF Secretariat.   The following information may be asked:

           a.    Name
           b.    Organization
           c.    Registration Number 
           d.    Location

3.2  Cost

   There may be a charge to attend an RPH.   This may be subsidized by
   entities wishing to do so.

3.3  Timing

   An RPH MUST be designated at a minimum of 30 days before the IETF
   meeting.

4   Functioning at Remote Participation Hubs

4.1 Coordinators

   At least one or preferably two (2) coordinators MUST be appointed by
   the RPH.  Contact information MUST be provided to the IETF
   Secretariat for inclusion in the calendar / Wiki.

4.2 Session Management

   Session management MUST be done as described in RFC2418:  IETF
   Working Group Guidelines and Procedures [RFC2418] Section 3.3 Session
   Management.

   NOTE Well MUST be shown at the start of the meeting.  Mike queuing
   discipline and fairness MUST be enforced by on-site coordinator(s).

4.3 Anti-Harrassment Procedures

   Anti-Harrssment procedures MUST be followed according to: RFC7776: 
   IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures [RFC7776].

4.4 Adherence to Proper Procedures

   The coordinators are responsible to maintain adherence to proper
   legal, registration, and other procedures exactly as would be true of
   a live IETF meeting.

   Failing to do so will mean that the RPH may not obtain approval in
   the next cycle.

4.5 Recording

   All activity at an RPH MUST be recorded for anyone wishing to view
   activity at a later date (and must be archived).

4.6 Technical Functioning

   In order for groups of individuals to remotely participate in the
   meetings, there are certain technical requirements that must be met
   to ensure a non-disruptive and trouble-free meeting experience. This
   document outlines the proper configuration for remote participation
   to various conferences throughout the world.

4.6.1 Bandwidth

   Adequate and good quality wired bandwidth is extremely important in
   order to have audio, video and presentations properly shared in both
   directions.

4.6.2 Physical Room Layout

   The layout of the meeting room is important in order for everyone to
   actively participate in the meeting. It is suggested that the
   coordinators keep the following points in mind when selecting and
   setting up the venue:

   a. Allow for plenty of time to set up and test the equipment prior to
   your first meeting.

   b. Each attendee will need at least one power port.

INTERNET DRAFTdraft-elkins-ietf-remote-participation-hubs-00June 15, 2017


   c. Heating and cooling can be a major factor.  Note that projectors
   and TVs can add to the room's heat.

   d. Take note of the location and quantity of the power and network
   connection points.

4.6.3 Audio

   A sound system that is properly sized to the audience is important.
   This will allow everyone to hear the local and remote audiences,
   speakers and presenters.  The coordinators may wish to consider using
   a robust audio system and a qualified technical person to install and
   operate the equipment throughout the duration of the meeting.


4.7 Responsibilities/Functions of the RPH Coordinators

   1. To Support the participants on how to utilize a remote hub.

   2. Take a lead in the facilitation of sessions ensuring continuity of
   the remote session.

   3. Take the attendance along with the IETF remote registration number

   4. Support the participants in communication with remote members,
   regarding session and activities in a working group.

   5. Submission of attendance to the IETF Seretriate.

   6. Set up the space with the appropriate furniture, equipment and
   materials for the IETF WG session each day.

   7. Oversee the documentation process through photos and help keep an
   organised archive for the sessions.

   8. Co-ordinate volunteers for the participation programme.

   9. Assist with the monitoring and evaluation of identified elements
   of the remote participation programme and ensure that data is entered
   onto the metric system as required.

4.8 Language of the communication of RPH

   The primary language of the RPH is "ENGLISH".  This must be
   communicated to the participants in advance.  The RPH may choose to
   have a translator present for local language support.
