Abstract

   The security model of the web platform has evolved over time to meet
   the needs of new applications and to correct earlier mistakes.
   Although web security has evolved largely organically, the security
   model has converged towards a handful of key concepts.  This document
   presents those concepts and provides advice to designers of new
   pieces of the web platform.

2.  Trust

   On the web, trust is specified by URL.  For example, HTML documents
   designate which script to run with a URL:


   <script src="https://example.com/library.js"></script>


   When a user agent process this element, the user agent will fetch the
   script at that URL and execute the script with the privileges of the
   document.  In this way, the document grants all the privileges it has
   to the resource specified by the URL.  In essence, the document
   declares that it trusts the integrity of information retrieved from
   that URL.

   In addition to importing libraries from URLs, user agents also let
   principals export data to URLs.  For example, consider the HTML form
   element:


   <form method="POST" action="https://example.com/login">
    ... <input type="password"> ...
   </form>


   When the user enters his or her password and submits the form, the
   password is sent to the network endpoint designated by the URL.  In
   this way, the document exports its secret data to that URL.  In
   essence, the document declares that it trusts the confidentiality of
   information sent to that URL.

2.1.  Pitfalls

   When designing new pieces of the web platform, make sure that
   important trust distinctions are visible in URLs.  For example, if
   both TLS and non-TLS protected resources used the "http" URL scheme,
   a document would be unable to specify that it wished to retrieve a
   script over TLS.  By using the "https" URL scheme, documents are able
   to indicate that they wish to interact with resources that are
   protected from active network attackers.

3.  Origin

   In principle, user agents could treat every URL as a separate
   principal and isolate each document from every other URL unless the
   document explicitly indicated that it trusted that URL.
   Unfortunately, this design is cumbersome for developers because web
   applications often consist of a number of resource acting in concert.

   As an approximation, user agents group URLs together into protection
   domains called origins.  In particular, two URLs are part of the same
   origin (i.e., represent the same principal) if they have the same
   scheme, host, and port.

   Q: Why not just use the host?

   A: Including the scheme in the origin tuple is essential for
   security.  If user agents did not include the scheme, there would be
   no isolation between documents from http://example.com and
   https://example.com because the two have the same host.  However,
   without this isolation, an active network attacker could corrupt the
   document retrieved from http://example.com and then use that document
   as a stepping stone to compromise the confidentiality and integrity
   of the document retrieved from https://example.com, bypassing the
   protections afforded by TLS.

   Q: Why use the fully qualified host name instead of just the "top-
   level" domain?

   A: Although the DNS has hierarchical delegation, the trust
   relationships between host names vary by deployment.  For example, at
   many educational institutions, students can host content at
   https://example.edu/~student/, but that does not mean a document
   authored by a student should be part of the same origin (i.e.,
   represent the same principal) as a web application for managing
   grades hosted at https://grades.example.edu/.

4.  Authority

   Although user agents group URLs into origins, not every resource in
   an origin carries the same authority.  For example, an image is
   passive content and, therefore, carries no authority, meaning the
   image has no access to the objects and resources available to its
   origin.  By contrast, an HTML document contains active content and,
   therefore, carries the full authority of its origin.  The user agent
   determines how much authority to grant a resource by examining its
   MIME type.  For example, resources with a MIME type of image/png are
   treated as images and resources with a MIME type of text/html are
   treated as HTML documents.

   When hosting untrusted content (such as user-generated content), web
   applications can limit that content's authority by restricting its
   MIME type.  For example, serving user-generated content as image/png
   is less risky than serving user-generated content as text/html.  Of
   course many web applications incorporate untrusted content in their
   HTML documents.  If not done carefully, these applications risk
   leaking their origin's authority to the untrusted content, a
   vulnerability commonly known as cross-site scripting.

4.1.  Pitfalls

   When designing new pieces of the web platform, be careful not to
   grant authority to resources irrespective of MIME type.  Many web
   applications server untrusted content with restricted MIME types.  A
   new web platform feature that grants authority to these pieces of
   content risks introducing vulnerabilities into existing applications.
   Instead, prefer to grant authority to MIME types that already possess
   the origin's full authority or to new MIME types designed
   specifically to carry the new authority.

5.  Policy

   Generally speaking, user agents isolate different origins and permit
   controlled communication between origins.  The details of how user
   agents provide isolation and communication vary depending on several
   factors.

5.1.  Object Access

   Most objects (also known as application programming interfaces or
   APIs) exposed by the user agent respect the same-origin policy.
   Specifically, a script running on behalf of one document can access
   objects associated with another document if, and only if, the two
   documents belong to the same origin, e.g., were retrieved from URLs
   with the same scheme, host, and port.

   There are some exceptions to this general policy.  For example, some
   parts of HTML's Location interface are available across origins
   (e.g., to allow for navigating other browsing contexts).  As another
   sample, HTML's postMessage interface is visible across origins to
   facilitate cross-origin communication.  Exposing objects to foreign
   origins is dangerous and should be done only with great care because
   doing so exposes these objects to potential attackers.

5.2.  Network Access

   Access to network resources varies depending on whether the resources
   are in the same origin as the document attempting to access them.

   Generally, reading information from another origin is forbidden.
   However, a document is permitted use some kinds of resources
   retrieved from other origins.  For example, a document is permitted
   to execute script, render images, and apply style sheets from any
   origin.  Likewise, a document can display a document from another
   origin in a frame.

   Generally, sending information to another origin is permitted.
   However, sending information over the network in arbitrary formats is
   dangerous.  For this reason, user agents restrict documents to
   sending information using particular protocols, such as in an HTTP
   request without custom headers.

5.3.  Pitfalls

   Whenever user agents allow documents from one origin to interact with
   resources in another origin, they invite security issues.  For
   example, the ability to display images from another origin leaks
   their height and width across origins.  Similarly, the ability to

Internet-Draft    Principles of the Same-Origin Policy     February 2011


   send network requests to another origin gives rise to cross-site
   request forgery vulnerabilities.  However, user agents tolerate these
   risks when the value proposition is high enough.  For example, a user
   agent that blocked cross-origin network requests would prevent its
   users from following hyperlinks, a core component of the web
   architecture.

   When designing new pieces of the web platform, it can be tempting to
   grant a privilege to one document but to withhold that privilege from
   another document in the same origin.  However, withholding privileges
   in this way is ineffective because the document without the privilege
   can usually obtain the privilege anyway because user agents do not
   isolate documents within an origin.  Instead, new pieces of the
   platform should grant or withhold privileges from origins as a whole
   (rather than discriminating between individual documents within an
   origin).

6.  Conclusion

   The web security model designates trust relationships with URLs.
   URLs are grouped together into origins, which represent principals.
   Some resources in an origin (active content) are granted the origin's
   full authority, whereas other resources in the origin (passive
   content) are not granted the origin's authority.  Documents that
   carry their origin's authority are granted access to objects and
   network resources within their own origin.  These documents are also
   granted limited access to objects and network resources of other
   origins, but these cross-origin privileges must be carefully designed
   to avoid introducing security vulnerabilities into the web platform.
