   This document complements [RFC8281] by addressing the requirements
   for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform route
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
   PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
   draft [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable
   active control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS network.

Internet-DraftExtensions to PCEP for GMPLS Remote InitiatioFebruary 2019


   [RFC8281] describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs
   under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC.  This enables realization of a dynamic
   network that is centrally controlled and deployed.  However, this
   specification is focused on MPLS networks, and does not cover the
   GMPLS networks (e.g., WSON, OTN, SONET/ SDH, etc. technologies).
   This document complements [RFC8281] by addressing the requirements
   for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.  These requirements are covered in
   Section 2 of this draft.  The PCEP extensions for remote initiated
   GMPLS LSPs are specified in Section 3.

2.  Requirements for Remote-Initiated GMPLS LSPs

   [RFC8281] specifies procedures that can be used for creation and
   deletion of PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model.
   However, this specification does not address GMPLS requirements
   outlined in the following:

   o  GMPLS support multiple switching capabilities on per TE link
      basis.  GMPLS LSP creation requires knowledge of LSP switching
      capability (e.g., TDM, L2SC, OTN-TDM, LSC, etc.) to be used
      [RFC3471] , [RFC3473] .

   o  GMPLS LSP creation requires knowledge of the encoding type (e.g.,
      lambda photonic, Ethernet, SONET/ SDH, G709 OTN, etc.) to be used
      by the LSP [RFC3471] , [RFC3473].

   o  GMPLS LSP creation requires information of the generalized payload
      (G-PID) to be carried by the LSP [RFC3471] , [RFC3473].

   o  GMPLS LSP creation requires specification of data flow specific
      traffic parameters (also known as Tspec), which are technology
      specific.

   o  GMPLS also specifics support for asymmetric bandwidth requests
      [RFC6387] .

   o  GMPLS extends the addressing to include unnumbered interface
      identifiers, as defined in [RFC3477] .

   o  In some technologies path calculation is tightly coupled with
      label selection along the route.  For example, path calculation in
      a WDM network may include lambda continuity and/ or lambda
      feasibility constraints and hence a path computed by the PCE is
      associated with a specific lambda (label).  Hence, in such
      networks, the label information needs to be provided to a PCC in
      order for a PCE to initiate GMPLS LSPs under the active stateful
      PCE model.  I.e., explicit label control may be required.

Internet-DraftExtensions to PCEP for GMPLS Remote InitiatioFebruary 2019


   o  GMPLS specifics protection context for the LSP, as defined in
      [RFC4872] , [RFC4873].

3.  PCEP Extensions for Remote-Initiated GMPLS LSPs

   LSP initiate (PCInitiate) message defined in [RFC8281] needs to be
   extended to include GMPLS specific PCEP objects as follows:

3.1.  Generalized Endpoint in LSP Initiate Message

   This document does not modify the usage of END-POINTS object for PCE
   initiated LSPs as specified in [RFC8281] . It augments the usage as
   specified below.

   END-POINTS object has been extended by
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions] to include a new object type
   called "Generalized Endpoint".  PCInitiate message sent by a PCE to a
   PCC to trigger a GMPLS LSP instantiation SHOULD include the END-
   POINTS with Generalized Endpoint object type.  Furthermore, the END-
   POINTS object MUST contain "label request" TLV.  The label request
   TLV is used to specify the switching type, encoding type and GPID of
   the LSP being instantiated by the PCE.

   If the END-POINTS Object of type Generalized Endpoint is missing the
   label request TLV, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   type=6 (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value= TBA (label request
   TLV missing).

   If the PCC does not support the END-POINTS Object of type Generalized
   Endpoint, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type = 3
   (Unknown Object), Error-value = 2(unknown object type).

   The unnumbered endpoint TLV can be used to specify unnumbered
   endpoint addresses for the LSP being instantiated by the PCE.  The
   END-POINTS MAY contain other TLVs defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions].

3.2.  GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object in LSP Initiate Message

   LSP initiate message defined in [RFC8281] can optionally include the
   BANDWIDTH object.  However, the following possibilities cannot be
   represented in the BANDWIDTH object:

   o  Asymmetric bandwidth (different bandwidth in forward and reverse
      direction), as described in [RFC6387] .

   o  Technology specific GMPLS parameters (e.g., Tspec for SDH/SONET,
      G.709, ATM, MEF, etc.) are not supported.

Internet-DraftExtensions to PCEP for GMPLS Remote InitiatioFebruary 2019


   GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object has been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions] to address the above-mentioned
   limitation of the BANDWIDTH object.

   This document specifies the use of GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object in
   PCInitiate message.  Specifically, GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTHobject MAY be
   included in the PCInitiate message.  The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object
   in PCInitiate message is used to specify technology specific Tspec
   and asymmetrical bandwidth values for the LSP being instantiated by
   the PCE.

3.3.  Protection Attributes in LSP Initiate Message

   This document does not modify the usage of LSPA object for PCE
   initiated LSPs as specified in [RFC8281] . It augments the usage of
   LSPA object in LSP Initiate Message to carry the end-to-end
   protection context this also includes the protection state
   information.

   The LSP Protection Information TLV of LSPA in the PCInitiate message
   can be used to specify protection attributes of the LSP being
   instantiated by the PCE.

3.4.  ERO in LSP Initiate Object

   This document does not modify the usage of ERO object for PCE
   initiated LSPs as specified in [RFC8281].  It augments the usage as
   specified in the following sections.

3.4.1.  ERO with explicit label control

   As mentioned earlier, there are technologies and scenarios where
   active stateful PCE requires explicit label control in order to
   instantiate an LSP.

   Explicit label control (ELC) is a procedure supported by RSVP-TE,
   where the outgoing label(s) is (are) encoded in the ERO.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions] extends the ERO object of PCEP
   to include explicit label control.  The ELC procedure enables the PCE
   to provide such label(s) directly in the path ERO.

   The extended ERO object in PCInitiate message can be used to specify
   label along with ERO to PCC for the LSP being instantiated by the
   active stateful PCE.

Internet-DraftExtensions to PCEP for GMPLS Remote InitiatioFebruary 2019


3.4.2.  ERO with Path Keys

   There are many scenarios in packet and optical networks where the
   route information of an LSP may not be provided to the PCC for
   confidentiality reasons.  A multi-domain or multi-layer network is an
   example of such networks.  Similarly, a GMPLS User- Network Interface
   (UNI) [RFC4208] is also an example of such networks.

   In such scenarios, ERO containing the entire route cannot be provided
   to PCC (by PCE).  Instead, PCE provides an ERO with Path Keys to the
   PCC.  For example, in the case UNI interface between the router and
   the optical nodes, the ERO in the LSP Initiate Message may be
   constructed as follows:

   o  The first hop is a strict hop that provides the egress interface
      information at PCC.  This interface information is used to get to
      a network node that can extend the rest of the ERO.  (Please note
      that in the cases where the network node is not directly connected
      with the PCC, this part of ERO may consist of multiple hops and
      may be loose).

   o  The following(s) hop in the ERO may provide the network node with
      the path key [RFC5520] that can be resolved to get the contents of
      the route towards the destination.

   o  There may be further hops but these hops may also be encoded with
      the path keys (if needed).

   This document does not change encoding or processing roles for the
   path keys, which are defined in [RFC5520].

3.4.3.  Switch Layer Object

   [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext] specifies the SWITCH-LAYER object
   which defines and specifies the switching layer (or layers) in which
   a path MUST or MUST NOT be established.  A switching layer is
   expressed as a switching type and encoding type.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions], which defines the GMPLS
   extensions for PCEP, suggests using the SWITCH-LAYER object.  Thus,
   SWITCH-LAYER object can be used in the PCInitiate message to specify
   the switching layer (or layers) of the LSP being remotely initiated.

3.5.  LSP delegation and cleanup

   LSP delegation and cleanup procedure specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions] are equally applicable to GMPLS
   LSPs and this document does not modify the associated usage.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC8281] apply to the
   extensions described in this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  PCEP-Error Object

   This document defines the following new Error-Value:


 Error-type              Error Value                 Reference
  6       Error-value = TBA: Label Request TLV Missing       this document
