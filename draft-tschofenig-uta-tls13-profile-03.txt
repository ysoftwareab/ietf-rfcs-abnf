1.  Introduction

   This document defines a profile of DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] and
   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] that offers communication security services for IoT
   applications and is reasonably implementable on many constrained
   devices.  Profile thereby means that available configuration options
   and protocol extensions are utilized to best support the IoT
   environment.

   For IoT profiles using TLS/DTLS 1.2 please consult [RFC7925].  This
   document re-uses the communication pattern defined in RFC 7925 and
   makes IoT-domain specific recommendations for version 1.3 (where
   necessary).

   TLS 1.3 has been re-designed and several previously defined
   extensions are not applicable to the new version of TLS/DTLS anymore.
   This clean-up also simplifies this document.  Furthermore, many
   outdated ciphersuites have been omitted from the TLS/DTLS 1.3
   specification.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Credential Types

   In accordance with the recommendations in [RFC7925] a compliant
   implementation MUST implement TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256.  It SHOULD
   implement TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.

   Pre-shared key based authentication is integrated into the main TLS/
   DTLS 1.3 specification and has been harmonized with session
   resumption.

   A compliant implementation supporting authentication based on
   certificates and raw public keys MUST support digital signatures with
   ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256.  A compliant implementation MUST support the
   key exchange with secp256r1 (NIST P-256) and SHOULD support key
   exchange with X25519.

   A plain PSK-based TLS/DTLS client or server MUST implement the
   following extensions:

   -  supported_versions

   -  cookie

   -  server_name

   -  pre_shared_key

   -  psk_key_exchange_modes

   For TLS/DTLS clients and servers implementing raw public keys and/or
   certificates the guidance for mandatory-to-implement extensions
   described in Section 9.2 of [RFC8446] MUST be followed.

4.  Error Handling

   TLS 1.3 simplified the Alert protocol but the underlying challenge in
   an embedded context remains unchanged, namely what should an IoT
   device do when it encounters an error situation.  The classical
   approach used in a desktop environment where the user is prompted is
   often not applicable with unattended devices.  Hence, it is more
   important for a developer to find out from which error cases a device
   can recover from.

5.  Session Resumption

   TLS 1.3 has built-in support for session resumption by utilizing PSK-
   based credentials established in an earlier exchange.

6.  Compression

   TLS 1.3 does not have support for compression.

7.  Perfect Forward Secrecy

   TLS 1.3 allows the use of PFS with all ciphersuites since the support
   for it is negotiated independently.

8.  Keep-Alive

   The discussion in Section 10 of RFC 7925 is applicable.

9.  Timeouts

   The recommendation in Section 11 of RFC 7925 is applicable.  In
   particular this document RECOMMENDED to use an initial timer value of
   9 seconds with exponential back off up to no less then 60 seconds.

   Question: DTLS 1.3 now offers per-record retransmission and therefore
   introduces much less congestion risk associated with spurious
   retransmissions.  Hence, should we relax the 9s initial timeout?

10.  Random Number Generation

   The discussion in Section 12 of RFC 7925 is applicable with one
   exception: the ClientHello and the ServerHello messages in TLS 1.3 do
   not contain gmt_unix_time component anymore.

11.  Server Name Indication (SNI)

   This specification mandates the implementation of the SNI extension.
   Where privacy requirements require it, the encrypted SNI extension
   [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] prevents an on-path attacker to determine the
   domain name the client is trying to connect to.  Note, however, that
   the extension is still at an experimental state.

12.  Maximum Fragment Length Negotiation

   The Maximum Fragment Length Negotiation (MFL) extension has been
   superseded by the Record Size Limit (RSL) extension [RFC8449].
   Implementations in compliance with this specification MUST implement
   the RSL extension and SHOULD use it to indicate their RAM
   limitations.

13.  Crypto Agility

   The recommendations in Section 19 of RFC 7925 are applicable.

14.  Key Length Recommendations

   The recommendations in Section 20 of RFC 7925 are applicable.

15.  0-RTT Data

   When clients and servers share a PSK, TLS/DTLS 1.3 allows clients to
   send data on the first flight ("early data").  This features reduces
   communication setup latency but requires application layer protocols
   to define its use with the 0-RTT data functionality.

   For HTTP this functionality is described in [RFC8470].  This document
   specifies the application profile for CoAP, which follows the design
   of RFC 8470.

   For a given request, the level of tolerance to replay risk is
   specific to the resource it operates upon (and therefore only known
   to the origin server).  In general, if processing a request does not
   have state-changing side effects, the consequences of replay are not
   significant.  The server can choose whether it will process early
   data before the TLS handshake completes.

   It is RECOMMENDED that origin servers allow resources to explicitly
   configure whether early data is appropriate in requests.

   This specification specifies the Early-Data option, which indicates
   that the request has been conveyed in early data and that a client

   understands the 4.25 (Too Early) status code.  The semantic follows
   RFC 8470.

   This section defines the CoAP Early-Data option with the semantic of
   RFC 8470.

   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+
   | No. | C | U | N | R | Name        | Format | Length | Default | E |

   | TBD2|   |   |   |   | Early-Data  | opaque |   4    | (none)  | x |
   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+

           C=Critical, U=Unsafe, N=NoCacheKey, R=Repeatable,
           E=Encrypt and Integrity Protect (when using OSCORE)

16.  Security Considerations

   This entire document is about security.

17.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to add the following two CoAP options to the CoAP
   Option Numbers registry:

    +--------+------------+---------------+
    | Number | Name       | Reference     |
    +--------+------------+---------------+
    |  TBD2  | Early-Data | This document |
    +--------+------------+---------------+

   IANA is asked to add the 4.25 (Too Early) Status Code to the CoAP
   Response Code registry:

    +------+------------------------------+-----------+
    | Code | Description                  | Reference |
    +------+------------------------------+-----------+
    | 4.25 | Too Early                    | This doc  |
