4.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


5.  Definition of RMON

Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes, are
instruments that exist for the purpose of managing a network.  Often
these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote significant
internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a network.  An
organization may employ many of these devices, one per network segment,
to manage its internet.  In addition, these devices may be used for a
network management service provider to access a client network, often
geographically remote.

When the RMON standard was young, this device-oriented definition of
RMON was taken quite literally, as RMON devices were probes purpose-
built and dedicated to running the RMON MIBs. Soon, cards were
introduced that added RMON capability into a network hub, switch or
router. RMON also began to appear as a software capability that was
added to the software of certain network equipment, as well as software
applications that could run on servers or clients. Despite the variety
of these approaches, the RMON capability in each serves as a dedicated
network management resource available for activities ranging from long-
term data collection and analysis or for ad-hoc firefighting.

In the beginning, most, but not all, of RMON's capabilities were based
on the promiscuous capture of packets on a network segment or segments.
Over time, that mixture included more and more capabilities that didn't
depend on promiscuous packet capture. Today, the some of the newest
standards added to the RMON framework allow multiple techniques of data
gathering, one of which is promiscuous packet capture.


6.  Goals of RMON

    o Offline Operation
        There are sometimes conditions when a management
        station will not be in constant contact with its
        remote monitoring devices.  This is sometimes by
        design in an attempt to lower communications costs
        (especially when communicating over a WAN or
        dialup link), or by accident as network failures
        affect the communications between the management
        station and the probe.

        For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be
        configured to perform diagnostics and to collect
        statistics continuously, even when communication with

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


        the management station may not be possible or
        efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify
        the management station when an exceptional condition
        occurs.  Thus, even in circumstances where
        communication between management station and probe is
        not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration
        information may be continuously accumulated and
        communicated to the management station conveniently
        and efficiently.

    o Proactive Monitoring
        Given the resources available on the monitor, it
        is potentially helpful for it continuously to run
        diagnostics and to log network performance.  The
        monitor is always available at the onset of any
        failure.  It can notify the management station of the
        failure and can store historical statistical
        information about the failure.  This historical
        information can be played back by the management
        station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis
        into the cause of the problem.

    o Problem Detection and Reporting
        The monitor can be configured to recognize
        conditions, most notably error conditions, and
        continuously to check for them.  When one of these
        conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and
        management stations may be notified in a number of
        ways.

    o Value Added Data
        Because a remote monitoring device represents a
        network resource dedicated exclusively to network
        management functions, and because it is located
        directly on the monitored portion of the network, the
        remote network monitoring device has the opportunity
        to add significant value to the data it collects.
        For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the
        network that generate the most traffic or errors, the
        probe can give the management station precisely the
        information it needs to solve a class of problems.

    o Multiple Managers
        An organization may have multiple management stations
        for different units of the organization, for different

        functions (e.g. engineering and operations), and in an
        attempt to provide disaster recovery.  Because
        environments with multiple management stations are
        common, the remote network monitoring device has to
        deal with more than own management station,
        potentially using its resources concurrently.

7.  RMON Standards

The RMON Framework includes a number of standards. Each standard that
makes up the RMON framework defines some new useful behavior (i.e. an
application) and managed objects that configure, control and montitor
that behavior. This section lists those standards and described the role
of each.


7.1.  RMON-1

The RMON-1 standard is focused at layer 2 and provides link-layer
statistics aggregated in a variety of ways. In addition, it provides
generation of alarms when thresholds are crossed as well as the ability
to filter and capture packet contents. The components of RMON-1 are:

  The Ethernet Statistics Group

      The ethernet statistics group contains statistics measured by the
      probe for each monitored Ethernet interface on this device.

  The History Control Group

      The history control group controls the periodic statistical
      sampling of data from various types of networks.

  The Ethernet History Group

      The ethernet history group records periodic statistical samples
      from an ethernet network and stores them for later retrieval.

  The Alarm Group

      The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
      variables in the probe and compares them to previously configured
      thresholds.  If the monitored variable crosses a threshold, an
      event is generated.  A hysteresis mechanism is implemented to
      limit the generation of alarms.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


  The Host Group

      The host group contains statistics associated with each host
      discovered on the network.  This group discovers hosts on the
      network by keeping a list of source and destination MAC Addresses
      seen in good packets promiscuously received from the network.

  The HostTopN Group

      The hostTopN group is used to prepare reports that describe the
      hosts that top a list ordered by one of their statistics.  The
      available statistics are samples of one of their base statistics
      over an interval specified by the management station.  Thus, these
      statistics are rate based.  The management station also selects
      how many such hosts are reported.

  The Matrix Group

      The matrix group stores statistics for conversations between sets
      of two addresses.  As the device detects a new conversation, it
      creates a new entry in its tables.

  The Filter Group

      The filter group allows packets to be matched by a filter
      equation.  These matched packets form a data stream that may be
      captured or may generate events.

  The Packet Capture Group

      The Packet Capture group allows packets to be captured after they
      flow through a channel.

  The Event Group

      The event group controls the generation and notification of events
      from this device.


7.2.  Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB

Some of the functions defined in the RMON-1 MIB were defined specific to
Ethernet media. In order to operate the functions on Token Ring Media,
new objects needed to be defined in the Token Ring Extensions to RMON
MIB. In addition, this MIB defines additional objects that provide

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


monitoring functions unique to Token Ring.

The components of the Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB are:

The Token Ring Statistics Groups

    The Token Ring statistics groups contain current utilization and
    error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two groups,
    the Token Ring Mac-Layer Statistics Group and the Token Ring
    Promiscuous Statistics Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer Statistics
    Group collects information from Mac Layer, including error reports
    for the ring and ring utilization of the Mac Layer.  The Token Ring
    Promiscuous Statistics Group collects utilization statistics from
    data packets collected promiscuously.

The Token Ring History Groups

    The Token Ring History Groups contain historical utilization and
    error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two groups,
    the Token Ring Mac-Layer History Group and the Token Ring
    Promiscuous History Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer History Group
    collects information from Mac Layer, including error reports for the
    ring and ring utilization of the Mac Layer.  The Token Ring
    Promiscuous History Group collects utilization statistics from data
    packets collected promiscuously.

The Token Ring Ring Station Group

    The Token Ring Ring Station Group contains statistics and status
    information associated with each Token Ring station on the local
    ring.  In addition, this group provides status information for each
    ring being monitored.

The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group

    The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group provides the order of the
    stations on monitored rings.

The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group

    The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group manages token ring stations
    through active means.  Any station on a monitored ring may be
    removed or have configuration information downloaded from it.

The Token Ring Source Routing Group

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


    The Token Ring Source Routing Group contains utilization statistics
    derived from source routing information optionally present in token
    ring packets.


7.3.  The RMON-2 MIB

The RMON-2 MIB extends the architecture defined in RMON-1 primarily by
extending RMON analysis up to the application layer.

The components of the RMON-2 MIB are:

The Protocol Directory Group

    Every RMON 2 implementation will have the capability to parse
    certain types of packets and identify their protocol type at
    multiple levels, The protocol directory presents an inventory of
    those protocol types the probe is capable of monitoring, and allows
    the addition, deletion, and configuration of protocol types in this
    list.

Protocol Distribution Group

    This function controls collection of packet and octet counts for any
    or all of the protocols detected on a given interface.  An NMS can
    use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by
    different protocols.

Address Mapping Group

    This function lists MAC address to network address bindings
    discovered by the probe and what interface they were last seen on.

Network Layer Host Group

    This function counts the amount of traffic sent from and to each
    network address discovered by the probe.

Network Layer Matrix Group

    This function counts the amount of traffic sent between each pair of
    network addresses discovered by the probe.

Application Layer Host Group

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


    This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent from
    and to each network address discovered by the probe.

Application Layer Matrix

    This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent
    between each pair of network addresses discovered by the probe.

User History

    This function allows an NMS to request that certain variables on the
    probe be periodically polled and for a time-series to be stored of
    the polled values.

Probe Configuration

    This group contains configuration objects that configure many
    aspects of the probe including the software downloaded to the probe,
    the out of band serial connection and the network connection.


7.4.  RMON MIB Protocol Identifiers

The RMON-2 MIB identifies protocols at any layer of the 7 layer
hierarchy with an identifier called a Protocol Identifier, or ProtocolID
for short.. ProtocolIDs also identify the particular configuration of
layering in use including any arbitrary encapsulations. The RMON MIB
Protocol Identifiers document is a companion document to the RMON-2 MIB
that defines a number of well-known protocols.

As the RMON Framwork has grown, other standards have been added to the
framework that utilize ProtocolIDs.


7.5.  Remote Network Monitoring MIB Extensions for Switched Networks

Switches have become pervasive in today's networks as a form of
broadcast media. SMON provides RMON-like functions for the monitoring of
switched networks.

Switches today differ from standard shared media protocols because:

   1)   Data is not, in general, broadcast.  This MAY be caused by the
        switch architecture  or by the connection-oriented nature of the
        data. This means, therefore, that monitoring non-broadcast





Expires December 21, 2002                                      [Page 10]





Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


        traffic needs to be considered.

   2)   Monitoring the multiple entry and exit points from a switching
        device requires a vast amount of resources - memory and CPU, and
        aggregation of the data in logical packets of information,
        determined by the application needs.

   3)   Switching incorporates logical segmentation such as Virtual LANs
        (VLANs).

   4)   Switching incorporates packet prioritization.

   5)   Data across the switch fabric can be in the form of cells. Like
        RMON, SMON is only concerned with the monitoring of packets.

Differences such as these make monitoring difficult. The SMON MIB
provides the following functions that help to manage switched networks:

smonVlanStats

    This function provides traffic statistics per Virtual LAN for 802.1q
    VLANs.

smonPrioStats

    This function provides traffic statistics per priority level for
    802.1q VLANS.

dataSourceCaps

    This function identifies all supported data sources on an SMON
    device. An NMS MAY use this table to discover the RMON and Copy Port
    attributes of each data source.

portCopyConfig

    Many network switches provide the capability to make a copy of
    traffic seen on one port and send it out another port for management
    purposes.  This occurs in addition to any copying performed during
    the normal forwarding behavior of the switch.

    The portCopyConfig function provides control of the port copy
    functionality in a device.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


7.6.  RMON MIB Extensions for Interface Parameters Monitoring

    Many network switches contain hundreds of ports, many with only one
    attached device. A common operation when managing such a switch is
    to sort the interfaces by one of the parameters (e.g. to the find
    the most highly utilized interface). If the switch contains many
    interfaces it can be expensive and time consuming to download
    information for all interfaces to sort it on the NMS. Instead, the
    ifTopN MIB allows the sorting to occur on the switch and for only
    the top interfaces to be downloaded.


7.7.  RMON for High Capacity Networks

    This MIB defines extensions to RMON for use on high capacity
    networks. Except for the mediaIndependentTable, each of the tables
    in this MIB adds high capacity capability to an associated table in
    the RMON-1 MIB or RMON-2 MIB.

    The mediaIndependentTable provides media independent utilization and
    error statistics for full-duplex and half-duplex media. Prior to the
    existence of the HCRMON MIB, a new table needed to be created for
    RMON monitoring of each data-link layer media. These tables included
    many statistical attributes of the media including packet and octet
    counters that are independent of the media type. This wasn't optimal
    because there was no way to monitor media types for which a media-
    specific table had not been defined. Further, there were no common
    objects to monitor media-independent attributes between media types.

    In the future, for media other than ethernet and token ring, the
    mediaIndependentTable will be the source for media-independent
    statistics. Additional media-specific tables may be created to
    provide attributes unique to particular media such as error
    counters.


7.8.  Application Performance Measurement MIB

The APM MIB provides analysis of application performance as experienced
by end-users.

Application performance measurement measures the quality of service
delivered to end-users by applications. With this perspective, a true
end-to-end view of the IT infrastructure results, combining the
performance of the application, desktop, network, and server, as well as

any positive or negative interactions between these components.

Despite all the technically sophisticated ways in which networking and
system resources can be measured, human end-users perceive only two
things about an application: availability and responsiveness.

   Availability - The percentage of the time that the application is
   ready to give a user service.

   Responsiveness - The speed at which the application delivers the
   requested service.


7.9.  Transport Performance Metrics MIB

The TPM MIB monitors selectable performance metrics and statistics
derived from the monitoring of network packets and sub-application level
transactions.  The metrics are defined through reference to existing
IETF, ITU and other standards organizations' documents.  The monitoring
covers both passive and active traffic generation sources.

The TPM MIB includes the following functions:

The tpmCapabilities Group

    The tpmCapabilitiesGroup contains objects and tables which show the
    measurement protocol and metric capabilities of the agent.

The tpmAggregateReports Group

    The tpmAggregateReportsGroup is used to provide the collection of
    aggregated statistical measurements for the configured report
    intervals.

The tpmCurrentReports Group

    The tpmCurrentReportsGroup is used to provide the collection of
    uncompleted measurements for the current configured report for those
    transactions caught in progress. A history of these transactions is
    also maintained once the current transaction has completed.

The tpmExceptionReports Group

7.10.  Synthetic Sources for Performance Monitoring MIB

The Synthetic Sources for Performance Monitoring MIB covers the
artificial generation of a) application-level, b) transport-level, and
c) link-level traffic for the purpose of monitoring system performance.
There are situations where it is useful to be able to control the
generation of synthetic traffic when evaluating system performance.
There are other situations where system performance evaluation can rely
upon naturally generated application-level traffic, in which case one
needs only monitor existing traffic and not instrument synthetic
traffic. The SSPM MIB provides the ability to configure and control the
generation of this synthetic traffic.

9.  Relationship of APM, TPM, and SSPM MIBs

Figure 1 below shows an overiew of the components of the performance
monitoring system.  On the far left of the diagram are the "Traffic
Generation Control" and the "Traffic Generation Instrumentation".  The
underlying instrumentation is implementation dependent and outside the
domain of the RMONMIB specifications.  The focus of the SSPM
specification within the RMONMIB is the traffic generation control
aspects shown in the figure.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


   It is the responsibility of the network management application to
   coordinate the individual aspects of the performance management
   system.  For example, within the RMONMIB framework:

      + SSPMMIB [1] is responsible for the traffic generation control,

      + APMMIB [2] is responsible for the aspects of the "Monitoring
      Metrics Control" directly related to the end-user's perceived
      application-level performance, and

      + TPMMIB [3] is responsible for the aspecys of the monitoring
      metrics control related to sub-application-level transactions.

   The testing model then is to first configure the traffic generation
   instrumentation through the SSPMMIB control function.  This defines
   aspects of the synthetic traffic such as application type, targets,
   etc.  Once the traffic generation is configured, the network
   management application can setup the monitoring instrumentation
   through the APMMIB and TPMMIB.  These control the reporting periods,
   the type of data aggregation, etc.  Once the tests are complete, the
   network management application retrieves the reports from the
   monitoring metrics control MIBs, e.g., APMMIB and TPMMIB.

   In order to instrument the traffic generation, SSPMMIB provides
   various types of information for the tests.

      + Protocol Information - the protocol information is specified
      through the appLocalIndex from the APMMIB [2].  The appLocalIndex
      supports standard application specification and user-defined
      application specification.  For more information on the
      appLocalIndex see the APMMIB[1].

      + Transaction Timing Models - the SSPMMIB controls the timing
      generation of the sythentic traffic.  Possible timing models
      include deterministic transation generation and random transaction
      generation.  The SSPMMIB should support traffic generation models
      as specified by the IPPM Working Group within the IETF [4].

      + Request Packet Configuration - the SSPMMIB supports three levels
      of packet configuration, i.e., Common Part, Link Level and
      Application Level.

         - The Common Part packet configuration covers aspects of the
         packet configuration common to all transactions.  These include
         the appLocalIndex, source and destination network addresses,

Internet Draft               RMON Framework                June 21, 2002


         timing model information, packet timeouts, packet fill, packet
         sequence number information, etc.

         - The Link Layer Configuration - the SSPMMIB contains a
         LinkLevelExtensionTable to configure aspects of the various
         link-level headers.  Examples of link-level header information
         includes media QOS parameters, etc.

         - The Application Level Configuration - the SSPMMIB contains an
         ApplicationLayerExtentionTable to configure application
         specific aspects of the synthetic transactions.  These include
         parameters such as username and password for application-layer
         authentication, application target information such as a URL in
         an HTTP transation, and other target information for other
         applications, e.g., hostname in an DNS transaction.

   Finally, the SSPMMIB presupposes the need for source and sink
   configuration in the context of one-way traffic generation for one-
   way measurements.  In this case, the SSPMMIB has seperate source and
   sink configuration tables.  For roundtrip measurements, the source
   and sink tables reside on the same device.  For one-way measurements,
   the source and sink tables reside on seperate remote devices.  This
   distinction may or may not be necessary, see, e.g., the One-Way Delay
   Protocol (OWDP) draft [5].
