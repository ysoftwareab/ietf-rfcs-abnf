1.  Introduction

   Multicast in BGP/MPLS IP or L2 VPN (referred to MVPN and L2 VPN
   Multicast respectively) can be achieved by using provider tunnels to
   deliver to all or a subset of PEs.  An example of L2 VPN is VPLS.
   The signaling of provider tunnel choice is very similar for both
   cases, and this memo describes managed objects common to both VPLS
   Multicast [RFC7117] and MVPN [RFC6513, RFC6514].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC6513, RFC6514, RFC 7117] and other documents that
   they refer to.  Familiarity with Multicast, MPLS, L3VPN, MVPN
   concepts and/or mechanisms is assumed.  Some of the terms are listed
   below.

   o  PMSI: P-Multicast Service Interface

   o  I-PMSI: Inclusive PMSI

   o  S-PMSI: Selective PMSI

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Summary of MIB Module

   L2L3-VPN-MCAST-MIB contains a Textual Convention,
   L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType, and a
   l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.  Other MIB objects ([I-D. ietf-
   bess-mvpn-mib]) may point to entries in the
   l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.

5.  Security Considerations

   This MIB contains some read-only objects that may be deemed senstive
   by some though perhaps not all operators.  Appropriate security
   procedures related to SNMP in general but not specific to this MIB
   need to be implemented by concerned operators.
