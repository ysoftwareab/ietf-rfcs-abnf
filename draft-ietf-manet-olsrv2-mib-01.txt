                     draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-mib-01

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring and managing
   aspects of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2.  The
   Optimized Link State Routing MIB also reports state information,
   performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
   configuration, this additional state and performance information is
   useful to management stations troubleshooting Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks
   routing problems.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
   version 2 (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)
   is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e. it exchanges
   topology information with other routers in the network regularly.
   OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing
   protocol.  Its key concept is that of MultiPoint Relays (MPRs).  Each
   router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of
   its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.  MPRs
   are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology
   reduction.

   This MIB document provides management and control capabilities of an
   OLSRv2 instance, allowing to monitor the state and performance of an
   OLSRV2 router, as well as to change settings of the deployment.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the OLSRv2 routing process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      OLSRv2 routing process on the router and the overall packet
      forwarding performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the Optimized Link State
   Routing version 2 Management Information Base (OLSRv2-MIB) module.
   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  olsrMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the OLSRv2-MIB.

   o  olsrMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the
      OLSRv2-MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the OLSRv2 objects
         that configure specific options that determine the overall
         operation of the OLSRv2 routing process and the unicast packet
         forwarding performance.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the OLSRv2 routing process, in particular the Information
         Bases of OLSRv2.

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the OLSRv2 routing process, typically
         statistics counters.

   o  olsrMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this OLSRv2-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the OLSRv2-MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus textual convention is imported from RFC 2579 [RFC2579].

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The OLSRv2 device is configured with a set of controls.  The list of
   configuration controls for the OLSRv2 device follows.

   o  Local History Times

      *  O_HOLD_TIME - is used to define the time for which a recently
         used and replaced originator address is used to recognize the
         router's own messages.

   o  Message Intervals

      *  TC_INTERVAL - is the maximum time between the transmission of
         two successive TC messages by this router.

      *  TC_MIN_INTERVAL - is the minimum interval between transmission
         of two successive TC messages by this router.

   o  Advertised Information Validity Times

      *  T_HOLD_TIME - is used to define the minimum Value in the
         VALIDITY_TIME TLV included in all TC messages sent by this
         router.

      *  A_HOLD_TIME - is the period during which TC messages are sent
         after they no longer have any advertised information to report,
         but are sent in order to accelerate outdated information
         removal by other routers.

   o  Received Message Validity Times

      *  RX_HOLD_TIME - is an interface parameter, and is the period
         after receipt of a message by the appropriate OLSRv2 interface
         of this router for which that information is recorded, in order
         that the message is recognized as having been previously
         received on this OLSRv2 interface.

      *  P_HOLD_TIME - is a router parameter, and is the period after
         receipt of a message which is processed by this router for
         which that information is recorded, in order that the message
         is not processed again if received again.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                November 2009


      *  F_HOLD_TIME - is a router parameter, and is the period after
         receipt of a message which is forwarded by this router for
         which that information is recorded, in order that the message
         is not forwarded again if received again.

   o  Jitter

      *  TP_MAXJITTER - represents the value of MAXJITTER used in
         [RFC5148] for periodically generated TC messages sent by this
         router.

      *  TT_MAXJITTER - represents the value of MAXJITTER used in
         [RFC5148] for externally triggered TC messages sent by this
         router.

      *  F_MAXJITTER - represents the default value of MAXJITTER used in
         [RFC5148] for messages forwarded by this router.

   o  Hop Limit Parameter

      *  TC_HOP_LIMIT - is the hop limit set in each TC message.

   o  Willingness

      *  WILLINGNESS - represents the router's willingness to be an MPR,
         and hence its willingness to forward messages and be an
         intermediate router on routes.

5.3.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information.  In OLSRv2, the
   state is stored in Information Bases.  These are separately discussed
   below.

   The Local Information Base (LIB), contains a router's local
   configuration, as defined by NHDP.  It is extended in the OLSRv2
   specification to also record an originator address and to include a
   router's:

   o  "Originator Set", which consists of Originator Tuples, each of
      which contains addresses that were recently used as this router's
      originator address.

   o  "Local Attached Network Set", which consists of Local Attached
      Network Set Tuples, each of which contains addresses of networks
      to which this router can act as a gateway.

   The Interface Information Based (IIB), recording information

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                November 2009


   regarding links on each MANET interface and symmetric 2-hop neighbors
   which can be reached through such links.  In addition to the uses in
   NHDP, information recorded in the Interface Information Bases is used
   for completing the Routing Set. The IIB contains two tables:

   o  A "Link Set", which records links from other routers which are, or
      recently were, 1-hop neighbors.  It consists of Link Tuples, each
      representing a single link.

   o  A "Two-Hop Set", which records network addresses of symmetric
      2-hop neighbors, and the symmetric links to symmetric 1-hop
      neighbors through which these symmetric 2-hop neighbors can be
      reached.  It consists of 2-Hop Tuples, each representing a single
      network address of a symmetric 2-hop neighbor, and a single MANET
      interface of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor

   The Neighbor Information Base (NIB), records information regarding
   current and recently lost 1-hop neighbors of this router.  The NIB
   contains two tables:

   o  The "Neighbor Set", which records all network addresses of each
      1-hop neighbor.  It consists of Neighbor Tuples, each representing
      a single 1-hop neighbor.

   o  The "Lost Neighbor Set", which records network addresses of
      routers which recently were symmetric 1-hop neighbors, but which
      are now advertised as lost.  It consists of Lost Neighbor Tuples,
      each representing a single such network address.

   The Topology Information Base (TIB), records information used for the
   calculation of the Routing Set. The TIB contains five tables:

   o  The "Advertising Remote Router Set", which records information
      describing each remote router in the network that transmits TC
      messages, allowing outdated TC messages to be recognized and
      discarded.  It consists of Advertising Remote Router Tuples.

   o  The "Router Topology Set", which records topology information
      about the links between routers in the MANET, allowing a
      "backbone" graph of all routers to be constructed using a minimum
      distance algorithm.  It consists of Router Topology Tuples.

   o  The "Routable Address Topology Set", which records topology
      information about the routable addresses within the MANET, and via
      which routers they may be reached.  It consists of Routable
      Address Topology Tuples.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                November 2009


   o  The "Attached Network Set", which records information about
      networks (which may be outside the MANET) attached to other
      routers and their routable addresses.  It consists of Attached
      Network Tuples.

   o  The "Routing Set", which records the first hop along a selected
      path to each destination for which any such path is known.  It
      consists of Routing Tuples.

   The Received Message Information Base (RMIB), records information
   regarding messages, that have been previously received, processed, or
   forwarded by this router.  The RMIB contains three tables:

   o  The "Received Set", which records the signatures of messages which
      have been received over that OLSRv2 interface.  Each consists of
      Received Tuples.

   o  The "Processed Set", which records signatures of messages which
      have been processed by the router.  It consists of Processed
      Tuples.

   o  The "Forwarded Set", which records signatures of messages which
      have been forwarded by the router.  It consists of Forwarded
      Tuples.

5.4.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   This section lists objects for OLSRv2 performance monitoring, some of
   which explicitly appear in the OLSRv2-MIB and others which are
   obtainable through a combination of base objects from this MIB and
   reports available through the REPORT-MIB [REPORT].  Throughout this
   section, those objects will be pointed out that are intended as base
   objects which will be explicitly defined within this MIB and those
   objects which are derived through a combination of the base objects
   and capabilities afforded by the REPORT-MIB.

   The objects in this group can be used to examine stability of the
   Routing Set, the selected MPRs, as well as message scheduling of this
   router.

         This object returns the history of the exact timestamps of each
         TC message that has been sent as well as the type of the
         message (triggered or periodical).  The list of events starts
         at the given point of time t0 and ends at the given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         is derived from the XXX Base Object.

   o  Histogram of the intervals between TC messages on an interface

         Returns the values (in a 2-dimensional array) that represent a
         histogram of intervals between TC messages, separated by
         periodic and triggered TC.  The histogram displays the
         distribution of intervals between two consecutive TC of the
         same type (triggered or periodical) using a given bin size.  It
         includes all TC that have been sent after the given time t0 and
         before the given time t1.

         This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1
         into a given number of equal parts.  It then creates a
         histogram for each part and calculate the distances (using the
         Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent histograms in
         time.  A higher value between two histograms means more
         difference between the histograms.  For instance, that could
         happen if suddenly many triggered TC messages are sent, whereas
         before there have been only very few such triggered messages.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The OLSRv2-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following OLSRv2-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                November 2009


   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use place holders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
