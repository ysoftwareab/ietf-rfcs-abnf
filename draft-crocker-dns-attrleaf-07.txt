         DNS Scoped Data Through '_Underscore' Attribute Leaves
                     draft-crocker-dns-attrleaf-07

Abstract

   Historically, any DNS RR may occur for any domain name.  Recent
   additions have defined DNS leaf nodes that contain a reserved node
   name, beginning with an underscore.  The underscore construct is used
   to define a semantic scope for DNS records that are associated with
   the parent domain.  This specification explores the nature of this
   DNS usage and defines the "underscore names" registry with IANA.

1.  Introduction

   The core DNS technical specifications assign no semantics to domain
   names or their parts, and no constraints upon which resource records
   (RRs) are permitted to be associated with particular names.  Over
   time, some leaf node names, such as "www" and "ftp" have come to
   imply support for particular services, but this is a matter of
   operational convention, rather than defined protocol semantics .
   This freedom in the basic technology has permitted a wide range of
   administrative and semantic policies to be used -- in parallel.  Data
   semantics have been limited to the specification of particular
   resource records, on the expectation that new ones would be added as
   needed.

   As an alternative to defining new RRs, some DNS service enhancements
   have specified a restricted scope for the occurrence of particular
   resource records.  That scope is a leaf node, within which the uses
   of specific resource records can be formally defined and constrained.
   The leaf has a distinguished naming convention: It uses a reserved
   DNS node name that begins with an underscore ("_").  Because a "host"
   domain name is not allowed to use the underscore character, this
   distinguishes the name from all legal host names.[RFC1035]
   Effectively, this convention creates a space for attributes that are
   associated with the parent domain, one level up.

   An established example is the SRV record [RFC2782] which generalizes
   concepts long-used for email routing by the MX record

   [RFC0974][RFC2821].  The use of special DNS names has significant
   benefits and detriments.  Some of these are explored in [RFC5507].

   [Comment]:    The terms "resolution context" and "scoping rules" have
      been suggested, in place of "semantic scope".  In order to avoid
      concern for matters of semantics, this specification uses the term
      "scoping rules", to create a focus on the mechanics being defined,
      rather than nuances of interpretation for the mechanism.

   The scoping feature is particularly useful when generalized resource
   records are used -- notably TXT and SRV.  It provides efficient
   separation of one use of them from another.  Absent this separation,
   an undifferentiated mass of these RRs is returned to the DNS client,
   which then must parse through the internals of the records in the
   hope of finding ones that are relevant; in some cases the results are
   ambiguous, because the records do not adequately self-identify.  With
   underscore-based scoping, only the relevant RRs are returned.

   This specification discusses the underscore "attribute" enhancement,
   provides an explicit definition of it, and establishes an IANA
   registry for the reserved names that begin with underscore.  It
   updates the many existing specifications that have defined underscore
   names, in order to aggregate the references to a single IANA table.

   Discussion Venue:    Discussion about this draft is directed to the
      apps-discuss@ietf.org [1] mailing list.

2.  Scaling Benefits and TXT and SRV Resource Records

   Some resource records are generic and support a variety of uses.
   Each additional use defines its own rules and, possibly, its own
   internal syntax and node-naming conventions to distinguish among
   particular types.  The TXT and SRV records are the notable examples.
   Used freely, some of these approaches scale poorly, particularly when
   the same RR can be present in the same leaf node, but with different
   uses.  An increasingly-popular approach, with excellent scaling
   properties, uses an underscore-based name, at a defined place in the
   DNS tree, so as to constrain to particular uses for particular RRs
   farther down the branch using that name.  This means that a direct
   lookup produces only the desired records, at no greater cost than a
   typical DNS lookup.

   In the case of TXT records, different uses have developed largely
   without coordination.  One side-effect is that there is no
   consistently distinguishable internal syntax for the record; even the
   inefficiencies of internal inspection might not provide a reliable
   means of distinguishing among the different uses.  Underscore-based
   names therefore define an administrative way of separating TXT

   records that might have different uses, but otherwise would have no
   syntactic markers for distinguishing among them.

   In the case of the SRV RR distinguishing among different types of use
   was part of the design.  [RFC2782] The SRV specification serves as a
   template, defining an RR that might only be used for specific
   applications when there is an additional specification.  The template
   definition includes reference to tables of names from which
   underscore-names should be drawn.  The set of <service> names is
   defined in terms of other IANA tables, namely any table with symbolic
   names.  The other SRV naming field is <proto>, although its pool of
   names is not explicitly defined.

3.  Underscore DNS Registry Function

   This specification creates a registry for DNS nodes names that begin
   with an underscore and are used to define scope of use for specific
   resource records (RR).  A given name defines a specific, constrained
   context for the use of such records.  Within this scope, use of other
   resource records that are not specified is permitted.  The purpose of
   the Underscore registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use
   of the same underscore-based name, for different applications.

   Structurally, the registry is defined as a single, flat table of
   names that begin with underscore.  In some cases, such as for SRV, an
   underscore name might be multi-part, as a sequence of underscore
   names.  Semantically, this is a hierarchical model and it is
   theoretically reasonable to allow re-use of an underscore name in
   different underscore contexts.  That is, a subordinate name is
   meaningful only within the scope of the first (parent) underscore
   name.  As such, they can be ignored by this global Underscore
   registry.  That is, the registry is for the definition of highest-
   level underscore node name used.

   Only the left-most names are registered in the IANA table.
   Definition and registration of the subordinate names is the
   responsibility of the specification that creates the highest-level
   (left-most) registry entry.

4.  DNS Underscore Registry Definition

   A registry entry contains:



      Name:    Specifies a textual name for a scoped portion of the DNS.
         The name will usually be taken from the specification cited in
         the "Purpose" column and is intended for use in discussions
         about the entry.

      DNS Label:    Specifies a single underscore name that defines a
         name reservation; this name is the "global" entry name for the
         scoped resource records that are associated with that name.

      Constraints:    Specifies any restrictions on use of the name.

      RR(s):    Lists the RRs that are defined for use within this
         scope.

      References  Lists specifications that define the records and their
         use under this Name.

      Purpose:    Specifies the particular purpose/use for specific
         RR(s), defined for use within the scope of the registered
         underscore name.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per [RFC2434], IANA is requested to establish a DNS Underscore Name
   Registry, for DNS node names that begin with the underscore character
   (_) and have been specified in any published RFC, or are documented
   by a specification published by another standards organization.  The
   contents of each entry are defined in Section 4.

   Initial entriess in the registry are:

      { Enhancement of this table to include all underscore name
      reservations in effect at the time this document is published is
      left as an exercise to the readers... /d }

6.  Related and Updated Registries

      This section needs to contained details specification of the
      updates to existing underscore "registries", in order to have
      those specifcations point to this new registry.

   Numerous specifications have defined their own, independent
   registries for use of underscore names.  It is likely that adoption
   of the proposed, integrated registry should render these piecemeal
   registries obsolete

   Registries that are candidates for replacement include:

      Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registry

      Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Parameters

      Presence SRV Protocol Label Registry
