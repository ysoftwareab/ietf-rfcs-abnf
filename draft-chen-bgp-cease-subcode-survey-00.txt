3. Summary


   This document provides an implementation report for the BGP Cease
   Subcodes [1].  Each response is listed. The editor makes no claim as
   to the accuracy of the information provided.


   The following organizations reported having implementations of the
   BGP Cease Subcodes: Hyperchip, Juniper Networks, and Redback
   Networks.



4. Implementation Forms



4.1. Hyperchip


     Person filling out this form: Jean Dube (jdube@hyperchip.com)


     Does your implementation recognize all the subcodes defined in
     the document?  (If not, list the subcodes that your implementation
     recognizes.)


       Yes


     List the subcodes that your implementation may send as part
     of a NOTIFICATION message.


       All (1 to 8, still some 0)


     Does your implementation include the Address Family information
     and the upper bound in the "Data" field of a NOTIFICATION message
     for the subcode "maximum number of prefixes reached"?


        Yes


     Does your implementation implement a backoff mechanism in re-trying
     a BGP connection, as recommended in the document?


        No


     List other implementations that you have tested for BGP Cease
     Subcodes interoperability.


        None

4.2. Juniper Networks


    Person filling out this form: Pedro R. Marques (roque@juniper.net)


    Does your implementation recognize all the subcodes defined in the
    document?  (If not, list the subcodes that your implementation
    recognizes.)


      It recognizes codes [1..7]. Code point 8 is not recognized.


    List the subcodes that your implementation may send as part of a
    NOTIFICATION message.


      1, 4, 5, 6, 7


    Does your implementation include the Address Family information
    and the upper bound in the "Data" field of a NOTIFICATION message
    for the subcode "maximum number of prefixes reached"?


     Yes.


    Does your implementation implement a backoff mechanism in
    re-trying a BGP connection, as recommended in the document?


      Backoff mechanism exists but is not dependent on this draft.


    List other implementations that you have tested for BGP Cease
    Subcodes interoperability.


      Don't know the answer. Me personally, i have not tested interop.



4.3. Redback Networks


     Person filling out this form: Jenny Yuan (jenny@redback.com)


     Does your implementation recognize all the subcodes defined in
     the document?  (If not, list the subcodes that your implementation
     recognizes.)


       Yes


     List the subcodes that your implementation may send as part
     of a NOTIFICATION message.


       1, 2, 3, 4, 6


     Does your implementation include the Address Family information




Chen                                                            [Page 3]






Internet Draft draft-chen-bgp-cease-subcode-survey-00.txt     April 2004



     and the upper bound in the "Data" field of a NOTIFICATION message
     for the subcode "maximum number of prefixes reached"?


       Yes


     Does your implementation implement a backoff mechanism in re-trying
     a BGP connection, as recommended in the document?


       Yes (as part of general backoff mechanism for BGP)


     List other implementations that you have tested for BGP Cease
     Subcodes interoperability.


       Not specifically tested, though can received CEASE subcodes from
       Juniper, and can send CEASE subcodes to Juniper as well.



5. Security Considerations


   This document does not address any security issues.



6. IANA Considerations
