Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas,
   and its Working Groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet Drafts.

   Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months.  Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by
   other documents at any time.  It is not appropriate to use Internet
   Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a
   ``working draft'' or ``work in progress.''

1.0 Introduction

   This document describes an allocation plan for IPv6 addresses to be
   used in testing IPv6 prototype software.  These addresses are
   temporary and will be reclaimed in the future.  Any IPv6 system using
   these addresses will have to renumber at some time in the future.
   These addresses will not to be routable in the Internet other than
   for IPv6 testing.

   This document is intended to replace RFC1897 "IPv6 Testing Address
   Allocation", January 1996.  RFC1897 will become historic.

   The addresses described in this document are consistent with the IPv6

   Addressing Architecture [ARCH].  They may be assigned to nodes
   manually, with IPv6 Auto Address Allocation [AUTO], or with DHCP for
   IPv6 [DHCPv6].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.0 Address Format

   The address format for the IPv6 test address is consistent with the
   aggregatable global unicast address allocation [AGGR] which is as
   follows:

      | 3 |  13 |    32     |   16   |          64 bits               |
      +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+
      |FP | TLA |   NLA*    |  SLA*  |         Interface ID           |
      +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+

   where:

      FP = 001 = Format Prefix

           This is the Format Prefix used to identify aggregatable
           global unicast addresses.

      TLA = 0x1FFE = Top Level Aggregator

           This is a TLA assigned by the IANA for 6bone testing under
           the auspices of the IETF IPng Transition Working Group 6bone
           testbed activity.  It is to be administered by the chair of
           the 6bone activity (Bob Fink at the present time).  The use
           of this TLA is temporary.  All users of these addresses in
           this TLA will be required to renumber at some time in the
           future.

      NLA* = Next-Level Aggregator(s)

           The NLA* space will be assigned, by the TLA administrator, in
           an addressing hierarchy sufficient to identify transit
           networks and end user sites consistent with the architecture
           and topology of the 6bone. This will provide a multi-level
           transit service consistent with the 6bone goals of fully
           testing IPv6 technology in real use environments.

      SLA* = Site-Level Aggregator(s)

           The SLA* field is used by an individual organization to
           create its own local addressing hierarchy and to identify
           subnets.  Assignment of the SLA* field is the responsibility
           of each individual organization.

      Interface ID

           This is the interface identifier of the interface on the link
           as defined in the appropriate IPv6 over <link> document, such
           as [ETHER], [FDDI], etc.
