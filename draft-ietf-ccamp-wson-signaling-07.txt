     Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
                 draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling-07.txt

Abstract

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
   optical networks (WSON).  Such extensions are applicable in WSONs
   under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional
   processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at
   specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured
   to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where
   equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with
   specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to
   support distributed wavelength assignment with choice in distributed
   wavelength assignment algorithms. These extensions build on previous
   work for the control of lambda and G.709 based networks. This
   document updates [RFC6205] as make it applicable to WSON-LSC capable
   equipment.

1. Introduction

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
   optical networks (WSON).  Fundamental extensions are given to permit
   simultaneous bidirectional wavelength assignment while more advanced
   extensions are given to support the networks described in [RFC6163]
   which feature connections requiring configuration of input, output,
   and general signal processing capabilities at a node along a LSP.

   These extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda
   and G.709 based networks [RFC3471].

   Related references with this document are [WSON-info] that provides
   a high-level information model and and [WSON-Encode] that provides
   common encodings that can be applicable to other protocol extensions
   such as routing.

   which are employed to transmit/terminate the optical signals for
   data transmission.



3. Requirements for WSON Signaling

   The following requirements for GMPLS based WSON signaling are in
   addition to the functionality already provided by existing GMPLS
   signaling mechanisms.

3.1. WSON Signal Characterization

   WSON signaling needs to convey sufficient information characterizing
   the signal to allow systems along the path to determine
   compatibility and perform any required local configuration. Examples
   of such systems include intermediate nodes (ROADMs, OXCs, Wavelength
   converters, Regenerators, OEO Switches, etc...), links (WDM systems)
   and end systems (detectors, demodulators, etc...). The details of

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions              March 2014


   any local configuration processes are out of the scope of this
   document.

   From [RFC6163] we have the following list of WSON signal
   characteristic information:

                    List 1. WSON Signal Characteristics

  1. Optical tributary signal class (modulation format).
  2. FEC: whether forward error correction is used in the digital
     stream and what type of error correcting code is used
  3. Center frequency (wavelength)
  4. Bit rate
  5. G-PID: General Protocol Identifier for the information format

   The first three items on this list can change as a WSON signal
   traverses a network with regenerators, OEO switches, or wavelength
   converters. These parameters are summarized in the Optical Interface
   Class as defined in the [WSON-Info] and the assumption is that a
   class always includes signal compatibility information.
   An ability to control wavelength conversion already exists in GMPLS
   signaling along with the ability to share client signal type
   information (G-PID). In addition, bit rate is a standard GMPLS
   signaling traffic parameter. It is referred to as Bandwidth Encoding
   in [RFC3471].

3.2. Per LSP Network Element Processing Configuration

   In addition to configuring a network element (NE) along an LSP to
   input or output a signal with specific attributes, we may need to
   signal the NE to perform specific processing, such as 3R
   regeneration, on the signal at a particular NE.  In [RFC6163] we
   discussed three types of processing not currently covered by GMPLS:

     (A) Regeneration (possibly different types)

     (B) Fault and Performance Monitoring

     (C) Attribute Conversion

   The extensions here MUST provide for the configuration of these
   types of processing at nodes along an LSP.

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions              March 2014


3.3. Bidirectional WSON LSPs

   WSON signaling can support LSP setup consistent with the wavelength
   continuity constraint for bidirectional connections. The following
   cases need to be separately supported:

   (a)  Where the same wavelength is used for both upstream and
        downstream directions

   (b)  Where different wavelengths can be used for both upstream and
        downstream directions.

   This document will review current GMPLS bidirectional solutions
   according to WSON case.

3.4. Distributed Wavelength Assignment Selection Method

   WSON signaling can support the selection of a specific distributed
   wavelength assignment method.

   This method is beneficial in cases of equipment failure, etc., where
   fast provisioning used in quick recovery is critical to protect
   carriers/users against system loss. This requires efficient
   signaling which supports distributed wavelength assignment, in
   particular when the centralized wavelength assignment capability is
   not available.

   As discussed in the [RFC6163] different computational approaches for
   wavelength assignment are available. One method is the use of
   distributed wavelength assignment. This feature would allow the
   specification of a particular approach when more than one is
   implemented in the systems along the path.

3.5. Optical Impairments

   This draft does not address signaling information related to optical
   impairments.

4. WSON Signal Traffic Parameters, Attributes and Processing

   As discussed in [RFC6163] single channel optical signals used in
   WSONs are called "optical tributary signals" and come in a number of
   classes characterized by modulation format and bit rate. Although
   WSONs are fairly transparent to the signals they carry, to ensure
   compatibility amongst various networks devices and end systems it
   can be important to include key lightpath characteristics as traffic
   parameters in signaling [RFC6163].

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions              March 2014


   LSPs signaled through extensions provided in this document MUST
   apply the following signaling parameters:

     . Switching Capability = WSON-LSC ([WSON-OSPF]).
     . Encoding Type = Lambda ([RFC3471])
     . Label Format = as defined in [RFC6205]

   [RFC6205] defines the label format as applicable to LSC capable
   device. This document extend [RFC6205] as make its label format
   applicable also to WSON-LSC capable devices.





4.1. Traffic Parameters for Optical Tributary Signals

   In [RFC3471] we see that the G-PID (client signal type) and bit rate
   (byte rate) of the signals are defined as parameters and in
   [RFC3473] they are conveyed Generalized Label Request object and the
   RSVP SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC objects respectively.

4.2. WSON Processing HOP Attribute TLV Encoding

   Section 3.2. provided the requirements for signaling to indicate to
   a particular NE along an LSP what type of processing to perform on
   an optical signal or how to configure that NE to accept or transmit
   an optical signal with particular attributes.

   To target a specific node, this section defines a WSON_Processing
   object as part of the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and follows procedures
   defined in [RSVP-RO].

   The content of this TLV is defined in the subsequent sections. (See
   Section 4.3 for <RBInformation> TLV and Section 4.4 for
   <WavelengthSelection> TLV, respectively.)

   <WSON_Processing HOP Attribute> ::= <RBInformation>
   [<RBInformation>]



   The WSON Processing carries sub-TLVs of the same format as a HOP
   Attributes TLV, as defined in [RSVP-RO].

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions              March 2014


4.3. Signal Attributes and Processing Capabilities

   The [WSON-Encode] already provides all necessary definitions and
   encoding for WSON information required for signaling. In particular,
   the Resource block information sub-TLV contains, among others, a
   list of available Optical Interface Classes and processing
   capabilities.

   <RBInformation> is defined in Section 4.1 of [WSON-Encode].

     Type        Sub-TLV

   1 (TBA)      <RBInformation>



   At least one <RBInformation> sub-TLV MUST always be present in the
   WSON_Processing HOP Attribute TLV.. At most two <RBInformation> sub-
   TLVs MAY be present in the WSON_Processing HOP Attribute TLV . If
   more than two objects are encountered, two MUST be processed and the
   rest SHOULD be ignored.

   The <RBInformation> contains several information as defined by
   [WSON-Encode]. The following processing rules apply:

   RB Set Field MAY contain more than one RB Indetifier. Only the first
   one MUST be processed, the others SHOULD be ignored.

   The I an E flags MUST be set according to bidirectional LSP
   signaling and the numbers of RBInformation subobjects available. In
   case of unidirectional signaling, only one RBInformartion sub-object
   MUST be processed and  I/E bits can be safely ignored. In case of
   bidirectional signaling: if only one RBInformartion is available,
   bits I and E MUST be both set to 1, if two RBInformation sub-objects
   are available, bits I and E MUST have different values.

   The rest of information available within RBInformation sub-object is
   Optical Interface Class List, Input Bit Range List and Processing
   Capability List. Lists MAY contain one or more elements. The usage
   of WSON Processing object for the bidirectional case is the same as
   per unidirectional. When an intermediate node uses information from
   this object to instruct a node about wavelength regeneration, the
   same information applies to both downstream and upstream directions.

4.4. Wavelength Assignment Method Selection TLV Encoding

   Routing + Distributed wavelength assignment (R+DWA) is one of the
   options defined by the [RFC6163]. The output from the routing
   function will be a path but the wavelength will be selected on a
   hop-by-hop basis.

   Under this hypothesis the node initiating the signaling process
   needs to declare its own wavelength availability (through a
   label_set object). Each intermediate node may delete some labels due
   to connectivity constraints or its own assignment policy. At the
   end, the destination node has to make the final decision on the
   wavelength assignment among the ones received through the signaling
   process.

   As discussed in [HZang00] a number of different wavelength
   assignment algorithms maybe employed. In addition as discussed in
   [RFC6163] the wavelength assignment can be either for a
   unidirectional lightpath or for a bidirectional lightpath
   constrained to use the same lambda in both directions.

   A simple sub-TLV could be used to indication wavelength assignment
   directionality and wavelength assignment method as a TLV in the LSP
   Attributes Object, as defined in [RFC5420].



      Type               Sub-TLV

       TDB          <WavelengthSelection>



       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Where:

     . W is a bit, 0 same wavelength in both directions, 1 may use
        different wavelengths
     . Wavelength Assignment (WA) Method: 0 unspecified (any), 1
        First-Fit, 2 Random, 3 Least-Loaded (multi-fiber).  Others TBD.

   supported security measures. Additionally, [RFC5920] provides an
   overview of security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for
   the GMPLS control plane.
