1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC, which is broadly defined in RFCs 4033 [RFC4033], 4034
   [RFC4034], and 4035 [RFC4035], uses cryptographic keys and digital
   signatures to provide authentication of DNS data.  Currently, the
   most popular signature algorithm is RSA.  RFC 6605 [RFC6605] defines
   usage of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for
   DNSSEC with curve P-256 and SHA-256, and ECDSA with curve P-384 and
   SHA-384.

   This document defines the DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records (RRs) of
   two new signing algorithm:

      Curve Ed25519 and SHA-512.

      Curve Ed448 and SHA-512.

   A description of both curves can be found in Elliptic Curves for
   Security [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].  A more thorough description of
   Ed25519 can be found in EdDSA and Ed25519
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].)

   Ed25519 is targeted to provide attack resistance comparable to
   quality 128-bit symmetric ciphers that is equivalent strength of RSA
   with 3072-bit keys.  Public keys are 256 bits (32 bytes) in length
   and signatures are 512 bits (64 bytes).

   Ed448 is targeted to provide attack resistance comparable to quality
   224-bit symmetric ciphers that is equivalent strength of RSA with

   ~12448-bit keys.  However only RSA with 4096-bit keys is defined for
   use in DNSSEC, so we are going to use RSA-4096 in comparisons below.
   Ed448 public keys are 448 bits (56 bytes) in length and signatures
   are 896 bits (112-bytes).  The curve is meant as a more conservative
   alternative to Ed25519.

   Using the Ed25519 and Ed448 curve in DNSSEC has some advantages and
   disadvantage relative to using RSA.  The Ed25519 and Ed448 keys are
   much shorter than RSA keys; at the comparable size, the difference is
   256 versus 3072 bits for the Ed25519 and 448 versus 4096 bits for the
   Ed448.  The Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures are also much shorter than
   RSA keys; at the comparable size, the difference is 512 versus 3072
   bits for the Ed25519 and 896 versus 4096 bits for the Ed448.  This is
   relevant because DNSSEC stores and transmits both keys and
   signatures.

   Signing with Ed25519 and Ed448 is significantly faster than with
   equivalently strong RSA, it is also faster than existing ECDSA curves
   in DNSSEC defined in RFC 6605 [RFC6605].  However, validating RSA
   signatures is significantly faster than validating Ed25519 and Ed448
   signatures.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for Ed25519 and Ed448

2.1.  Public Keys

   The Ed25519 public keys consist of a 32-byte value that represents
   encoding of the curve point.  The generation of public key is defined
   Chapter 5.5 in I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].

   The Ed448 public key consist of a 56-byte value that represents
   encoding of the curve point.

   In DNSSEC keys, the Ed25519 and Ed448 public key is a simple bit
   string that represents uncompressed form of a curve point.

2.2.  Signatures

   The Ed25519 signature consists of a 64-byte value.  The Ed25519
   signature algorithm is described Chapter 5.6 in I-D.josefsson-eddsa-
   ed25519 [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519].

   The Ed448 signature consists of a 112-byte value.  In DNSSEC keys,
   the Ed448 signatures is a simple bit string that represents the Ed448
   signature.

   In DNSSEC keys, the Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures is a simple bit
   string that represents the signature.

2.3.  Algorithm Numbers

   The algorithm number associated with the DNSKEY and RRSIG resource
   records is fully defined in the IANA Considerations section.  DNSKEY
   and RRSIG RRs signifying:

      Ed25519 and SHA-512 use the algorithm number TBD1.

      Ed448 and SHA-512 use the algorithm number TBD2.

                 this algorithm with Transaction Security.

6.  Security Considerations

   Ed25519 is targeted to provide attack resistance comparable to
   quality 128-bit symmetric ciphers, and Ed448 is targeted to provide
   attack resistance comparable to quality 224-bit symmetric ciphers.
   Such an assessment could, of course, change in the future if new
   attacks that work better than the ones known today are found.
