                 Network Time Protocol Leap Smear REFID
                  draft-stenn-ntp-leap-smear-refid-00

Abstract

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] and earlier versions of NTP are the overwhelming
   method of distributing time on networks.  Leap Seconds will continue
   to exist for a good number of years' time, and since the timescale
   mandated by POSIX effectively ignores any instances where there are
   not 86,400 seconds' time in a day, something must be done to reliably
   synchronize clocks during the application of leap second corrections.
   One mechanism for dealing with the application that has recently
   become visible is to apply the leap second using a "smear", where the
   time reported by leap-second aware servers is gradually adjusted so
   there is no major disruption to time synchronization when processing
   a leap second.

   While leap second processing can be expected to be properly handled
   by up-to-date software and by time servers, there are large numbers
   of out-of-date software installations and client systems that are
   just not able to properly handle a leap second correction.

   This proposal offers a way for a system to generate a REFID that
   indicates that the time being supplied in the NTP packet already
   contains an amount of leap smear correction, and what that amount is.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] and earlier versions of NTP are the overwhelming
   method of distributing time on networks.  Leap Seconds will continue
   to exist for a good number of years' time, and since the timescale
   mandated by POSIX effectively ignores any instances where there are

   synchronize clocks during the application of leap second corrections.
   One mechanism for dealing with the application that has recently
   become visible is to apply the leap second using a "smear", where the
   time reported by leap-second aware servers is gradually adjusted so
   there is no major disruption to time synchronization when processing
   a leap second.

   While leap second processing can be expected to be properly handled

Internet-Draft   Network Time Protocol Leap Smear REFID       March 2016


   This proposal offers a way for a system to generate a REFID that
   indicates that the time being supplied in the NTP packet already
   contains an amount of leap smear correction, and what that amount is.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Leap Smear REFID

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] defines the data type of NTP time values in
   Section 6, "Data Types":

      All NTP time values are represented in twos-complement format,
      with bits numbered in big-endian (as described in Appendix A of
      [RFC0791]) fashion from zero starting at the left, or high-order,
      position. ...

   The 32 bit signed integer seconds portion and the 32 bit unsigned
   fractional seconds portion, or 32:32 format is:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                            Seconds                            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                            Fraction                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       NTP Timestamp Format (32:32)

   This format provides coverage for 136 years' time to a precision of
   232 picoseconds.  If a leap-second addition is being completely
   smeared just before before the stroke of the next POSIX second then
   the smear correction will be (0,1).  If this was the only way to
   apply a leap smear correction then we could simply use an unsigned
   value to represent the correction.  But while the first popular leap
   smear implementation applied the correction over an appropriate
   number of hours' time before the actual leap second so the system
   time was corrected at the stroke of 00:00, that meant that the
   difference between system time and UTC spent half of the duration of
   the smear application at [.5,1) "off" of correct time.  The second
   popular implementation of the leap smear applied the first half-
   second correction before the stroke of 00:00 for a correction range
   of (0,.5] and the last half-second correction starting at the stroke

   of 00:00 for a [-.5,0) correction range.  This also means we need a
   signed value to represent the amount of correction.

   The REFID of a system that is supplying smeared time to client
   requests while leap-smear correction is active would be 254.b1.b2.b3,
   where the three octets (b1, b2, and b3) are a 2:22 formatted value,
   yielding precision to 238 nanoseconds, or about a quarter of a
   microsecond.

   Note that if an NTP server decides to offer smeared time corrections
   to clients, it SHOULD only offer this time in response to CLIENT time
   requests.  An NTP server that is offering smeared time SHOULD NOT
   send smeared time in any peer exchanges.  Also, CLIENT machines
   SHOULD not be distributing time (smeared or otherwise) to other
   systems.

   We also note that during the application of a leap smear, the REFID
   from a system offering smeared time cannot provide detection of a
   timing loop.  This is not expected to be a problem because time
   server systems are not expected to make CLIENT connections with each
   other, so they should not be receiving smeared time.  Moreso, if a
   time server is configured to make CLIENT connections to a server that
   offers smeared time, with the mechanism described here it can detect
   when it is getting smeared time, and either ignore time from that
   source, or "undo" the leap smear correction and use the corrected
   time for that sample.

   This proposal is not an attempt to justify servers offering leap
   smeared time.  It is only an attempt to make it easy and visible to
   identify when a client is receiving smeared time, and provide the
   client to know the amount of smear correction as of the latest
   successful poll.

3.  Questions

   Should we ask IANA to allocate a pseudo Extension Field Type of
   0xFFFE (for example) so the proposed "I-Do" exchange can report
   whether or not this server will offer leap smeared time in response
   to CLIENT time requests, identifying the amount of correction using
   the above REFID?

4.  Acknowledgements

   The author wishes to acknowledge Dan Mahoney (and perhaps others) for
   suggesting the idea of using an "impossible" first-octet value to
   indicate an IPv6 refid hash.  The author wishes to acknowledge the
   contributions of Joey Saccadonuts.
