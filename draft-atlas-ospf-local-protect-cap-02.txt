1.  Introduction

   The motivations for an extension to OSPF version 2 to allow
   advertising link capabilities is to both allow the signaling required
   by [U-TURN] and to provide for future extensibility.

   [RFC3630] specifies OSPFv2 Traffic Engineering extensions for
   carrying link attributes, via a new Link TLV which is carried in the
   TE LSA.  The Link TLV comprises of several sub-TLVs characterizing
   the links.  Among those sub-TLVs are the Link ID and Link Type sub-
   TLVs, which are the only mandatory sub-TLVs.  This is the set of
   information that is necessary to associated advertised link
   capabilities to the specific link.  To avoid potentially unnecessary
   redundant advertisement of the Link ID and Link Type, in the event
   that a router needs to support signaling for both TE and link
   capabilities, this document proposes adding a Link Capabilities sub-
   TLV to the Link TLV.

   The Link Capabilities sub-TLV is defined and three bits are
   identified to support the signaling required by [U-TURN].


2.  Link Capabilities sub-TLV

   A new "Link Capabilities" sub-TLV is defined here to be carried in
   the "Link" TLV which uses the TE LSA [RFC3630].  The Link
   Capabilities field contains 32 flags, each indicating a different
   link capability.  The following flags are defined:

           Bit     Capability
           0-1      Reserved
            2       Link excluded from local protection path
           3-4      Reserved
            5       Explicit Marked U-Turn Recipient Capable
            6       Implicit U-Turn Recipient Capable
           7-31     Future assignments

                     Following is the format for Link-ID sub TLV:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type = 10        |             Length = 4        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |             Link Capabilities                                 |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.  Interpretation for U-turn Alternates for IP Fast-Reroute

   The OSPFv2 extensions described in this document define three bits
   which are relevant for determining the capabilities of a link in
   reference to U-turn Alternates for IP/LDP Fast-Reroute.

   If a link is advertised as "link excluded from local protection
   path", then the router's neighbors are informed that the router
   considers whether that link cannot be used as an alternate next-hop.
   For other applications, such as RSVP-TE FRR [RFC4090], this means the
   link SHOULD not be included in any computation of a repair path by
   any other router in the routing area.

   If a router's link is advertised as Implicit U-turn Recipient
   capable, then the advertising router can apply the implicit U-turn
   packet identification method[U-TURN] to identify packets as U-turn
   packets and redirect those U-turn packets towards an appropriate
   alternate next-hop, if such is available.  A neighbor, which wishes
   to use this link as a U-turn alternate next-hop, should not mark
   traffic sent on the link into a U-turn alternate.

   If a router's link is advertised as Explicit Marked U-turn Recipient
   capable, then the advertising router can apply the explicitly marked
   U-turn packet identification method[U-TURN] to identify packets as
   U-turn packets and redirect those U-turn packets towards an
   appropriate alternate next-hop, if such is available.  A neighbor,
   which wishes to use this link as a U-turn alternate next-hop, should
   mark traffic sent on the link into a U-turn alternate.


4.  IANA Considerations

   A new sub-TLV in the Link TLV will need to be assigned by IANA; this
   is requested to be type 10, which is to be assigned via Standards
   Action [RFC3630].  The remaining bits in the Link Capabilities sub-
   TLV will need to be assigned by IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security issues.
