1. Abstract

   This draft proposes an event package for [SIP], which uses the
   SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods [SUB/NTFY] to carry message waiting
   status and message summaries from a messaging system to an
   interested User Agent.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].


3. Background and Overview

   Messaging Waiting Indication is a common feature of telephone
   networks.  It typically involves playing a special dial tone (called
   message-waiting dial tone), lighting a light or indicator on the
   phone, or both.  Message-waiting dial tone is similar but distinct
   from stutter dial tone.  Both are defined in [GR506].


Mahy, Slain                                                   [Page 1]
Internet Draft           SIP Message Waiting                  Feb 2001


   The methods in SIP 2.0, as defined in RFC2543, were only designed to
   solve the problem of session initiation for multimedia sessions, and
   rendezvous.  Since Message Waiting Indication is really status
   information orthogonal to a session, it was not clear how an IP
   telephone acting as a SIP User Agent would implement comparable
   functionality.  Members of the telephony community viewed this as a
   shortcoming of SIP.

   Users want the useful parts of the functionality they had using
   traditional analog and PBX telephones.  It is also desirable to
   provide comparable functionality in a flexible way that allows for
   more customization and new features.

   Using the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods, A Subscriber User Agent
   (typically an IP phone or SIP soft-phone) subscribes to the status
   of their messages.  A SIP User Agent acting on behalf of the user's
   messaging system then notifies the Subscriber whenever the account's
   messages have changed. The Notifier sends this message summary
   information in the body of the NOTIFY, encoded in a new MIME type
   defined later in this draft.  A User Agent can also explicitly fetch
   the current status.

   A SIP User Agent MAY subscribe to multiple accounts (distinguished
   by the URL in the To header).  Multiple SIP User Agents MAY
   subscribe to the same account.

   Before any subscriptions or notifications are sent, each interested
   User Agents must be made aware of its messaging server(s).  This MAY
   be manually configured on the User Agents, manually configured in
   the proxies, or dynamically discovered using caller preferences
   [Caller-Prefs]. (For more information on usage with caller
   preferences, see section 4.2)


6. Simple Message Summary Format

   A simple text-based format is proposed to prevent an undue burden on
   low-end user agents, for example, inexpensive IP phones with no
   display.  Although this format is text-based, it is intended for
   machine consumption only.

   The format specified in this proposal attempt to separate orthogonal
   attributes of messages as much as possible.  Messages are separated
   by media type (audio, text, image, and video); by message status
   (new and old); and by urgent and non-urgent type.

   The text format begins with a simple status line, and optionally a
   summary line per media type.  Valid media types are Voicemail
   (audio), Email (text), Fax (image), and Video (video).  For each
   media type the total number of new and old messages is reported in
   the new and old fields.


Mahy, Slain                                                   [Page 2]
Internet Draft           SIP Message Waiting                  Feb 2001



        messsage-summary = status-line  [*(summary-line)] [ mheaders ]
        status-line  = "Messages-Waiting: " status CRLF
        summary-line = media-type ": "  new "/" old  [ urgent ] CRLF
        urgent = "(" new-urgent "/" old-urgent ")"
        status = "yes" | "no"

   In some cases, detailed message summaries are not available.  The
   status line allows messaging systems or messaging gateways to
   provide the traditional boolean message waiting notification.

        Messages-Waiting: yes

   In the example that follows, more functionality is available to User
   Agent.  There are one new and three old voice messages.

        Voicemail: 1/3

   After the summary, the format can optionally list a summary count of
   urgent messages. Of the one new and three old voice messages, none
   of the new messages are urgent, but one of the old messages is.

        Voicemail: 1/3 (0/1)

   Optionally, after the summary counts, the messaging systems MAY
   append message headers, which further describe newly added messages.
   A messaging system which includes message headers in a NOTIFY, MUST
   provide an administrator configurable mechanism for selecting which
   headers are sent. Likely headers for inclusion include To, From,
   Date, Subject, Message-ID, and Priority.  Note that the syntax for
   these headers is more restrictive than for [SMTP].

   Mapping local message state to new/old message status and urgency is
   an implementation issue of the messaging server.  Message servers
   which use [IMAP4] SHOULD follow the most current recommendations of
   the [VPIM] Working Group.

   For SMTP encoded messages, messaging systems SHOULD follow the
   recommendations of the VPIM Working Group using either MIME type
   information of  [Message-Context] to map messages to a specific
   media type.  Systems using other encodings MAY define their own
   mappings.

4. Examples of Usage

4.1  Example Message Flow

   In the example call flow below, Rohan's IP phone subscribes to the
   status of Rohan's messages. Via headers are omitted for clarity.

4.2  Use with Caller Preferences

   The use of caller preferences is purely optional but its use is
   encouraged.  If caller preferences is used, a messaging server MAY
   REGISTER a Contact with a "SUBSCRIBE" methods tag.  If SUBSCRIBE is
   used by other services, the messaging server MAY also REGISTER as a
   Contact with the feature="voice-mail" tag.  An example of this kind
   of registration follows below.

5. Specific Use of SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY


5.1  Behavior of Subscriber (Ordinary User Agent)

   Subscriber User Agents will typically SUBSCRIBE to message summary
   information for a period of hours or days, and automatically attempt
   to re-SUBSCRIBE when the subscription is half-expired.  If re-
   subscription fails, the Subscriber SHOULD periodically retry again
   (for example, after the subscription is 66%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,
   95%, and 99% expired) until a subscription is successful. The
   example retry sequence is similar to that used by [DHCP] Clients
   trying to renew a lease.  If a subscription has expired, the
   Subscriber MAY attempt to renew the expired subscription in
   intervals of about 10% of the expires period of the original or
   requested subscription.  These new subscriptions MUST use a new
   Call-ID.

   The Subscriber SHOULD SUBSCRIBE to that user's message summaries
   whenever a new user becomes associated with the device (a new
   login).  The Subscriber MAY also explicitly fetch the current status
   at any time.  The subscriber SHOULD renew its subscription
   immediately after a reboot, or when the subscriber's network
   connectivity has just been re-established.

   The Subscriber MUST be prepared to receive and process a NOTIFY with
   new state immediately after sending a new SUBSCRIBE, a SUBSCRIBE,
   renewal, an unSUBSCRIBE or a fetch; or at any time during the
   subscription.

   When a user de-registers from a device (logoff, power down of a
   mobile device, etc.), subscribers SHOULD unsubscribe by sending a
   SUBSCRIBE message with an Expires header of zero.



Mahy, Slain                                                   [Page 9]
Internet Draft           SIP Message Waiting                  Feb 2001


   A Subscriber MAY use an "alias" or "group" in the To header and/or
   Request-URI if that name is significant to the messaging system.
   User Agents SHOULD tolerate non-SIP URI schemes in the To and From
   fields.

   A Subscriber MUST be prepared to receive NOTIFYs from different
   Contacts corresponding to the same SUBSCRIBE.  (the SUBSCRIBE may
   have been forked).

   Implementers MAY create a service which consolidates and summarizes
   NOTIFYs from many Contacts.


5.3  Behavior of the Notifier (Messaging System)

   When a SIP Messaging System receives SUBSCRIBE messages with the
   message-summary event-type, it obeys the following rules.

   Immediately after a subscription is accepted, the Notifier MUST send
   a NOTIFY with the current message summary information.  This allows
   the Subscriber to resynchronize its state.  This initial
   synchronization NOTIFY MUST NOT include the optional message
   headers.

   When the status of the messages changes sufficiently for a messaging
   account to change the number of new or old messages, the Notifier
   SHOULD send a NOTIFY message to all active subscribers to that
   account.  NOTIFY messages sent to subscribers of a group or alias,
   MUST place the account name in the user part of the Contact header
   URL.

   A Notifier MAY choose to buffer NOTIFY responses for a short
   administrator-defined period (seconds or minutes) when the message
   status is changing rapidly.  Note that timely notification of a
   newly added message is probably more significant to the end user
   than notifications of newly deleted messages.


5.4  Behavior of a Proxy Server

   There are no additional requirements on the Proxy, other than to
   transparently forward the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods. However,
   Proxies SHOULD allow non-SIP URLs.  Proxies and Redirect servers
   SHOULD be able to direct the SUBSCRIBE request to an appropriate
   messaging server User Agent.  Proxies SHOULD support routing to
   Contacts based on the existence of methods="SUBSCRIBE" and
   feature="voice-mail" parameters in a Request-Contact header (as
   specified in the caller preferences specification).

6. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specifications use the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form [BNF] as described in RFC-2234.

6.1  New event-type definition

   The syntax of the Event header is defined in SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY as
   shown below.

        Event         =  "Event" ":" SP 1#event-type
        event-type    =  token

   This document amends that definition as shown below.

        event-type    =  message-event | token
        message-event =  "simple-message-summary"

6.2  Body Format Syntax

   The formal syntax for application/simple-message-summary is below:

   messsage-summary = status-line  [*(summary-line)] [ mheaders ]
   status-line  = "Messages-Waiting: " status CRLF
   summary-line = media-type ":" SP new "/" old  [ urgent ] CRLF
   status = "yes" | "no"
   media-type = "Voicemail" | "Email" | "Fax" | "Video"

   mheaders = *(CRLF message-headers)
   message-headers = hname ":" SP hvalue CRLF
   hname = #( alphanum | "-" | "_" )
   hvalue = <Any [UTF-8] except CTL>
   alphanum = lowalpha | upalpha | DIGIT

   new = WHOLENUMBER
   old = WHOLENUMBER
   new-urgent = WHOLENUMBER
   old-urgent  = WHOLENUMBER
   WHOLENUMBER = *DIGIT
   DIGIT = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
   upalpha  = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" |
              "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" |
              "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"
   lowalpha = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" |
              "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" |
              "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
   CTL = %0x00-1f | %0x7f ; (0-31 or 127)
   CRLF = %d13 %d10
   SP = %d32

7. IANA Considerations

7.1  MIME Registration for application/simple-message-summary

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: simple-message-summary

      Required parameters: none.

      Optional parameters: none.

      Encoding considerations: This type is only defined for transfer
           via [SIP].

      Security considerations: See the "Security Considerations"
           (Section 8) section in this document.

      Interoperability considerations: none

      Published specification: This document.

      Applications which use this media: The simple-message-summary
      application subtype supports the exchange of message waiting and
      message summary information in SIP networks.

      Additional information:

           1. Magic number(s): N/A

           2. File extension(s): N/A

           3. Macintosh file type code: N/A

8. Security Considerations

   At a minimum, SUBSCRIPTION requests for message waiting, and message
   waiting NOTIFY messages SHOULD be authenticated.  Because of the
   potential privacy implications, encrypting NOTIFY messages is
   encouraged to keep potentially sensitive information private.
   Additionally, SUBSCRIPTION requests MAY be encrypted.  Hop-by-hop
   encryption could discourage unauthorized disclosure of the address
   or location of the user's account.

9. Changes from -00

   This draft greatly simplifies and shortens the -00 version.

   1) The generic behavior of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY is now greatly clarified
   in [SUB/NTFY] and made consistent with PINT and SIP for presence.
   This message waiting draft is now consistent with [SUB/NTFY].


Mahy, Slain                                                  [Page 12]
Internet Draft           SIP Message Waiting                  Feb 2001


   2) The XML format has been removed due to lack of immediate
   interest.  At a future date, similar functionality may be added as
   another event package with an appropriate MIME type.

   3) An IANA Considerations section was added to register the new
   "application/simple-message-summary" MIME type and the "simple-
   message-summary" SIP event package.

   4) The "flag-list" was removed due to lack of interest and to
   encourage simplicity.

   5) Due to synchronization issues, and the recommendation of the VPIM
   Working Group, support for message count "deltas" was removed.

   6) The Messages-Waiting line in the body is now mandatory.

   7) This version of the draft clarifies the role of caller
   preferences as optional but encouraged.

   8) A set of SMTP-like headers from the triggering messages may now
   optionally follow the message summaries, provided that the resulting
   NOTIFY on UDP fits in a single datagram.
