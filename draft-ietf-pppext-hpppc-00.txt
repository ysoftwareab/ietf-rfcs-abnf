Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.

   The PPP Compression Control Protocol [2] provides a method to
   negotiate and utilize compression protocols over PPP encapsulated
   links.

   This document describes the use of the HP PPC compression algorithm
   for compressing PPP encapsulated packets.

1.  Introduction

   The HP PPC compression algorithm is an improvement on the existing
   implementations of the LZ variant known as LZ2.  In particular the
   scheme uses an intermediate dictionary initialization.  This method
   allows for a dictionary with fewer entries than the alphabet size.
   Thus, compression is possible with very small dictionaries, requiring
   very little memory.  This is particularly attractive for networks
   where each packet is compressed independently.

   Other enhancements include run length encoding and parameter
   initialization based on input packet size.

   Since this is a packet by packet scheme, only one compression
   dictionary is needed per link and  no reliable link is required or
   necessary.

   If the compressed packet is larger than the input packet, the input
   packet is sent uncompressed.

2.  HP PPC Packets

   Before any HP PPC packets may be communicated, PPP must reach the
   Network-Layer Protocol phase, and the CCP Control Protocol must reach
   the Opened state.

   Exactly one HP PPC datagram is encapsulated in the PPP Information
   field, where the PPP Protocol field indicates type hex 00FD
   (compressed datagram).

   The maximum length of the HP PPC datagram transmitted over a PPP link
   is the same as the maximum length of the Information field of a PPP
   encapsulated packet.


Reliability and Sequencing

   Each HP PPC packet is considered a separate entity.  Therefore, the
   compression tables are reset for each packet.  Reliable links are not
   necessary.  Packets need not be delivered in sequence.


Data Expansion

   Although the compression algorithm might occasionally expand a data
   packet, there is no expansion in HP PPC since such packets are sent
   uncompressed.

2.1.  Packet Format

   The encapsulation is the same for every packet.

PPP Protocol

   The PPP Protocol field is described in the Point-to-Point Protocol
   Encapsulation [1].

   When the HP PPC compression protocol is successfully negotiated by
   the PPP Compression Control Protocol [2], the value is 00FD hex.
   This value MAY be compressed when Protocol-Field-Compression is
   negotiated.

C
   In the off chance that a packet expanded during compression, this bit
   is set.

      0 = compressed
      1 = uncompressed

Uncompressed Length

   This is the length of the uncompressed data.  It is used as a limit
   during the decompression process.

3.  Configuration Option

   No configuration option is required.
