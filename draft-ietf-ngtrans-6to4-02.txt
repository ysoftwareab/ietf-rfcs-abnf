                                 Abstract

                      draft-ietf-ngtrans-6to4-02.txt

   This memo specifies an optional mechanism for assigning a unique
   IPv6 address prefix to any site that currently has at least one
   globally unique IPv4 address, and describes scenarios for using such
   a prefix during the co-existence phase of IPv4 to IPv6 transition.

   The motivation for this method is to allow isolated IPv6 domains,
   attached to an IPv4 network which has no native IPv6 support, to
   communicate with other such IPv6 domains with minimal manual
   configuration. Effectively it treats the IPv4 network as a
   link layer. It also automatically provides a globally unique IPv6
   address prefix to any site with at least one globally unique IPv4
   address, even if combined with an IPv4 Network Address Translator
   (NAT).

0. Changes and Issues
   Changes from 01 to 02 version:

   - added some pictures
   - added sub-section on relay via ISP
   - added scenario on usage with configured tunnels
   - improved discussion of routing
   - improved and moved discussion of multicast
   - added section on relay router config
   - added note on incongruent routing
   - minor fixes

   Issues, and points not added:

   - there is debate about how 6to4 sites locate relay routers;
     do they have to make EGP routing announcements?
   - draft recommends generic address selection algorithm;
     not everybody wants this.
   - soemone observed that configured tunnels can co-exist
     with IPv4 NAT; true, but doesn't belong here.
   - discarded suggestion of scrambling (inverting)
     bit order in 6to4 prefix; doesn't buy anything
     except confusion.

1. Introduction

   This memo specifies an optional mechanism for assigning a unique IPv6
   address prefix to any site that currently has at least one globally
   unique IPv4 address, and describes scenarios for using such a prefix
   during the co-existence phase of IPv4 to IPv6 transition. Note that
   these scenarios are only part of the total picture of transition to
   IPv6, in addition to the mechanisms in [RFC 1933].

   The motivation for this method is to allow isolated IPv6 domains,
   attached to a wide area network which has no native IPv6 support, to
   communicate with other such IPv6 domains with minimal manual
   configuration. Effectively it treats the wide area IPv4 network as a
   point-to-point link layer.

   IPv6 domains connected using this method do not require IPv4-
   compatible IPv6 addresses [RFC 1933] or configured tunnels. In this
   way IPv6 gains considerable independence of the underlying wide area
   network and can step over many hops of IPv4 subnets. The abbreviated
   name of this mechanism is 6to4 (not to be confused with [6OVER4]).
   The 6to4 mechanism is implemented almost entirely in border routers,
   without specfic host modifications except a recommended address
   selection algorithm. Only a modest amount of router configuration is
   required.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. IPv6 Prefix Allocation

   Suppose that a subscriber site has at least one valid, globally
   unique 32-bit IPv4 address, referred to in this document as V4ADDR.
   This address MUST be duly allocated to the site by an address
   registry (possibly via a service provider) and it MUST NOT be a
   private address [RFC 1918].

   The IANA has permanently assigned one 13-bit IPv6 Top Level
   Aggregator (TLA) identifier under the IPv6 Format Prefix 001 [AARCH,
   AGGR], referred to in this document as TLA624. Its numeric value is
   0x0010.

   [*** temporary note - this assignment remains to be made and may
   change ***]

   The subscriber site is then deemed to have the following IPv6 address
   prefix, without any further assignment procedures being necessary:
      Prefix length: 48 bits
      Format prefix: 001
      TLA value: TLA624
      NLA value: V4ADDR

   This is illustrated as follows:

         | 3 |  13 |    32     |   16   |          64 bits               |
         +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+
         |FP | TLA | V4ADDR    | SLA ID |         Interface ID           |
         |001| 624 |           |        |                                |
         +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+

   Thus, this prefix has exactly the same format as normal prefixes
   assigned according to [AGGR]. Within the subscriber site it can be
   used for automated address assignment and discovery according to the
   normal mechanisms such as [CONF, DISC].

   If the subscriber site is not yet running native IPv6, but is running
   IPv4 multicast, this "6 to 4" address prefix can be used in
   conjunction with the "6 over 4" mechanism [6OVER4]. Thus isolated
   IPv6 hosts within isolated IPv6 domains can communicate by using "6
   over 4" to a border router and "6 to 4" over the wide area.

3. Maximum Transmission Unit

   If the IPv6 MTU size proves to be too large for some intermediate
   IPv4 subnet, IPv4 fragmentation will ensue.  While undesirable, this
   is not necessarily disastrous, unless the fragments are delivered to
   different IPv4 destinations due to some  form of IPv4 anycast. The
   IPv4 "do not fragment" bit MUST NOT be set in the encapsulating IPv4
   header.

   The default MTU size for IPv6 packets is 1280 octets [IPV6], which is
   greater than the specified minimum IPv4 MTU size of 576 octets [RFC
   791].  In the event that the IPv6 Path MTU is discovered to be less
   than 1280 octets, the 6to4 router MUST return an ICMP Packet Too Big
   message reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.  The procedure
   described in the last paragraph of Section 5 of [IPv6] MUST then be
   followed by analogy. Note that this does not require any modification
   to an IPv6 host conforming to [IPv6]. Other considerations are as
   described in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC 1933].

4. Frame Format

   IPv6 packets are transmitted in IPv4 packets [RFC 791] with an IPv4
   protocol type of 41, the same as has been assigned [RFC 1933] for
   IPv6 packets that are tunneled inside of IPv4 frames.  The IPv4
   header contains the Destination and Source IPv4 addresses.  One or
   both of these will be identical to the V4ADDR field of an IPv6 prefix
   formed as specified above (see section 6 for more details).  The IPv4
   packet body contains the IPv6 header and payload.

   If there are IPv4 options, then padding SHOULD be added to the IPv4
   header such that the IPv6 header starts on a boundary that is a 32-
   bit offset from the end of the datalink header.

   The IPv4 Time to Live will be set as normal [RFC 791], as will the
   encapsulated IPv6 hop limit [IPv6]. Other considerations are as
   described in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC 1933].

5. Unicast scenarios, scaling, and transition to normal prefixes

5.1 Simple scenario - all sites work the same

   The simplest deployment scenario for 6to4 is to use it between a
   number of sites, each of which has at least one connection to a
   shared IPv4 Internet. This could be the global Internet, or it could
   be a corporate IP network. In the case of the global Internet, there
   is no requirement that the sites all connect to the same Internet
   service provider. The only requiremement is that any of the sites is
   able to send IPv4 packets to any of the others.

   By definition, each site has an IPv6 prefix in the format defined in
   Section 2. It will therefore create DNS records for these addresses.
   For example, site A which owns IPv4 address 192.1.2.3 will create DNS
   records with the IPv6 prefix {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=192.1.2.3}/48.
   Site B which owns address 9.254.253.252 will create DNS records with
   the IPv6 prefix {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=9.254.253.252}/48.

   When an IPv6 host on site B queries the DNS entry for a host on site
   A, the DNS returns an address with the prefix
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=192.1.2.3}/48 and whatever SLA and Interface
   ID applies.  The converse applies when a host on site A queries the
   DNS for a host on site B. IPv6 packets are formed and transmitted in
   the normal way within both sites.

   |_________________________________| |_________________________________|

   The only change to standard IPv6 routing is that the border router on
   each 6to4 site MUST include the sending rule:

        if the destination address of an IPv6 packet is
          {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16
          then
              if the NLA field is an IPv4 address assigned to this site
                then queue the packet for local IPv6 forwarding
                else encapsulate the packet in IPv4 as in Section 3
                     with destination address set to the NLA value V4ADDR;
                     queue the packet for IPv4 forwarding.

   A simple decapsulation rule for incoming IPv4 packets with protocol
   type 41 MUST be implemented:
          Apply any security checks (see Section 8)
          Remove the IPv4 header
          Submit the packet to local IPv6 routing.

   In this scenario, no IPv4 routing information is imported into IPv6
   routing (nor vice versa). The above special sending rule is the only
   contamination of IPv6 forwarding, and it occurs only at border
   routers.

   In this scenario, any number of 6to4 sites can interoperate with no
   tunnel configuration, and no special requirements from the IPv4
   service. All that is required is the appropriate DNS entries and the
   special sending rule configured in the 6to4 router. This router
   SHOULD also generate the appropriate IPv6 prefix announcements [CONF,
   DISC].

   The sites are not required run an IPv6 unicast routing protocol among
   themselves in a pure 6to4 scenario.

   It is RECOMMENDED that in any case each site should use only one IPv4
   address per 6to4 router, and that should be the address assigned to
   the external interface of the 6to4 router.  Single-homed sites
   therefore SHOULD use only one IPv4 address for 6to4 routing.  Multi-

   homed sites are discused in section 5.3. Note that the IPv4 interface
   that is carrying the 6to4 traffic is logically equivalent to an IPv6
   interface, and is referred to below as a pseudo-interface.

   Because of the lack of configuration, and the distributed deployment
   model, there are believed to be no particular scaling issues with the
   pure 6to4 mechanism.

5.2 Mixed scenario with relay to native IPv6

   Suppose one or more of the sites described above acquire native IPv6
   connectivity in addition to 6to4 connectivity. In this case it is
   necessary to relay packets between the 6to4 realm and the native IPv6
   realm. There must be at least one router acting as a relay.  There is
   nothing special about this; it is simply a normal router which
   happens to have at least one logical 6to4 pseudo-interface and at
   least one other IPv6 interface.

   An IPv6 router willing to act as a relay from native IPv6 to the 6to4
   address space is known as a relay router.  It MUST advertise a route
   to {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 into the native IPv6 routing system.
   Additionally, an IPv6 unicast routing protocol such as BGP4+ MUST be
   used among the set of communicating 6to4 routers including the relay
   router. The relay router MUST advertise whatever native IPv6 prefixes
   are appropriate on its 6to4 pseudo-interface. These prefixes will
   indicate the regions of native IPv6 topology that the relay router is
   willing to relay to. Their choice is a matter of routing policy. It
   is clearly desirable for network operators to carefully consider
   desirable traffic patterns and topology when choosing the scope of
   such advertisements.

   Within a 6to4 site, the {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 prefix will normally
   be handled as a default route.

   It is a matter of routing policy how far the advertisement of
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 is propagated. Since there will presumably be
   multiple relay routers advertising it, network operators will require
   to filter it in a managed way. Incorrect policy in this area will
   lead to potential unreachability or to perverse traffic patterns.

   A 6to4 site which also has a native IPv6 connection MUST NOT
   advertise its TLA624/48 prefix on that connection, and IPv6 network
   operators MUST filter out and discard any TLA624 prefix
   advertisements longer than /16.

   Sites which have at least one native IPv6 connection, in addition to
   a 6to4 connection, will therefore have at least one IPv6 prefix which
   is not a TLA624 prefix. Such sites' DNS entries will reflect this and
   DNS lookups will return multiple addresses.  If two such sites need
   to interoperate, whether the 6to4 route or the native route will be
   used depends on IPv6 address selection by the individual hosts (or
   even applications).

   Now consider again the example of the previous section. Suppose an
   IPv6 host on site B queries the DNS entry for a host on site A, and
   the DNS returns multiple IPv6 addresses with different prefixes. If
   the host picks the 6to4 prefix according to some rule for multiple
   prefixes, it will simply send packets to an IPv6 address formed with
   the prefix {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=192.1.2.3}/48. It is essential that
   they are sourced from the prefix
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=9.254.253.252}/48 for two-way connectivity to
   be possible.

   The following algorithm would result in correct address selection.
   Suppose that sending host B has a set {B} of IPv6 addresses, and the
   DNS has returned a set {A} of IPv6 addresses for host A. Then B
   performs a longest prefix match for each address in {B} against each
   member of {A}, and selects as the address pair to be used that pair
   with the overall longest match. This guarantees that a pair of TLA624
   addresses will be selected unless there is a better match using
   native IPv6 addresses, which is the desired result. In the case of a
   tie the choice is arbitrary.

   In practice address selection will proceed in two stages. First, a
   call to gethostbyname2 [API] will return a set of valid destination
   addresses. It is RECOMMENDED that these should be sorted in order of
   longest match to the host's set of valid source addresses. It is then
   the RECOMMENDED default that the host selects the first destination
   address from that list and selects the source address with the
   longest match.

   cooperative 6to4 user site.  An elementary variant of this is for an
   Internet Service Provider, that already offers native IPv6
   connectivity, to operate a relay router. Technically this is no
   different from the previous scenario; site B is simply an internal
   6to4 site of the ISP, possibly containing only one system, i.e. the
   relay router itself.

5.2.2 Summary of relay router configuration

   A relay router participates in IPv6 unicast routing protocols on its
   native IPv6 interface and on its 6to4 pseudo-interface, but these are
   independent routing realms with separate policies (even if the same
   protocol, such as BGP4+, is used in both cases).

   A relay router also participates in IPv4 unicast routing protocols on
   its IPv4 interface used to support 6to4, but this is not further
   discussed here.

   On its native IPv6 interface, the relay router MUST advertise a route
   to {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16. It MUST NOT advertise a longer
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624} prefix on that interface. Routing policy within
   the native IPv6 routing realm determines the scope of that
   advertisement, thereby limiting the visibility of the relay router in
   that realm.

   On its 6to4 IPv6 pseudo-interface, the relay router advertises
   whatever IPv6 native prefixes its local policy permits, from among
   those reachable through its native IPv6 interface. In the simplest
   case, a default route to the whole IPv6 address space MAY be
   advertised.

   Finally, a route MUST be configured in the relay router to each 6to4
   router it is willing to serve (for example, the relay router shown
   above must be configured with a route to Site A, i.e.
   2010:c001:0203::/48).  Note that configuring this route is the
   logical equivalent of configuring one end of a configured tunnel [RFC
   1933], but it will be managed as part of a routing configuration.

   [**The following sentence is contested by some parties.**]
   Conversely, each 6to4 router served by the relay router MUST be
   configured with a default IPv6 route to the relay router (for
   example, Site A's default IPv6 route will be 2010:09fe:fdfc::/48).

   Clearly this requirement for explicit route configuration is an
   operational scaling issue, but one configuration action per user site
   is as little as can be reasonably expected. Additional mechanisms to
   automate such configuration are for further study.

   In general a relay router should not attempt to serve more sites than
   any other transit router, allowing for the encapsulation overhead.

5.2.3 Unwilling to relay

   It may arise that a site has a router with both 6to4 pseudo-
   interfaces and native IPv6 interfaces, but is unwilling to act as a
   relay router. Such a site MUST NOT advertise any {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}
   prefix into the native IPv6 realm and MUST NOT advertise any native
   IPv6 prefixes or a default IPv6 route into the 6to4 realm. Within the
   6to4 realm it will behave exactly as in the pure 6to4 scenario of
   Section 5.1.

5.3 Variant scenario with tunnel to IPv6 space

   A 6to4 site which has no v6 connections to the "native" IPv6 Internet
   MAY acquire effective connectivity to the v6 Internet via a
   "configured tunnel" (using the terminology in [RFC 1933]) to a
   cooperating router which does have v6 access.  RFC 1933 proposes that
   such tunnels could be autoconfigured using a v4 anycast address, but
   this is outside of the scope of this document. Alternatively a tunnel
   broker can be used. This scenario would be suitable for a small
   user-managed site.

5.4 Multihoming

   Sites which are multihomed on IPv4 MAY extend the 6to4 scenario by
   using a TLA624 prefix for each IPv4 border router, thereby
   automatically obtaining a degree of IPv6 multihoming. The address
   selection algorithm of the previous section will apply.

5.5 Transition considerations

   If the above rules for routing advertisements and address selection
   are followed, then a site can migrate from using 6to4 to using native
   IPv6 connections over a long period of co-existence, with no need to
   stop 6to4 until it has ceased to be used. The stages involved are

   1. Run IPv6 on site using any suitable implementation. True
   native IPv6, [6OVER4], or tunnels are all acceptable.

   2. Configure a border router (or router plus IPv4 NAT)
   connected to the external IPv4 network to support 6to4,
   including advertising the appropriate TLA624 prefix locally.
   Configure IPv6 DNS entries using this prefix. At this point
   the 6to4 mechanism is automatically available, and the site
   has obtained a "free" IPv6 prefix.

   3. Identify a 6to4 relay router willing to relay the site's
   traffic to the native IPv6 world. This could either be at
   another cooperative 6to4 site, or an ISP service. Configure
   a default IPv6 route to that relay router, and have the relay

Internet Draft Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds      June 1999

   router configure a route to this site's 6to4 prefix.

   4. When native external IPv6 connectivity becomes available,
   add a second (native) IPv6 prefix to both the border router
   configuration and the DNS configuration. At this point, the
   address selection rule described above will determine when
   6to4 and when native IPv6 will be used.

   5. When 6to4 usage is determined to have ceased (which may
   be several years later), remove the 6to4 configuration.

5.6 Usage with firewall or NAT

   The 6to4 mechanisms can run exactly as described above in the
   presence of a firewall at the border router.

   If the site concerned has very limited global IPv4 address space, and
   is running an IPv4 network address translator (NAT), all of the above
   mechanisms remain valid. The NAT box must also contain a fully
   finctional IPv6 router including the 6to4 mechanism. The address used
   for V4ADDR will simply be a globally unique IPv4 address allocated to
   the NAT. In the example of Section 5.1 above, the 6to4 routers would
   also be the sites' IPv4 NATs, which would own the globally unique
   IPv4 addresses 192.1.2.3 and 9.254.253.252.

   Combining a 6to4 router with an IPv4 NAT in this way offers  the site
   concerned a globally unique IPv6 /48 prefix, automatically, behind
   the IPv4 address of the NAT. Thus every host behind the NAT can
   become an IPv6 host with no need for additional address space
   allocation, and no intervention by the Internet service provider.  No
   address translation is needed by these IPv6 hosts.

   A more complex situation arises if a host is more than one NAT hop
   away from the globally unique IPv4 address space. This document does
   not address this situation in detail. However, it can certainly be
   handled by administrative sub-allocation of the TLA624 prefix
   constructed from the global IPv4 address of the outermost NAT.

5.7 Usage within Intranets

   There is nothing to stop the above scenario being deployed within a
   private corporate network as part of its internal transition to IPv6;
   the corporate IPv4 backbone would serve as the virtual link layer for
   individual corporate sites using TLA624 prefixes.  In this case the
   V4ADDR MAY  be a private IPv4 address [RFC 1918], which MUST be
   unique within the private network.  The corresponding DNS record MUST
   NOT be advertised outside the private network.

5.8 Summary of impact on routing

   IGP (site) routing will treat the local site's TLA624 /48  prefix
   exactly like a native IPv6 site prefix assigned to the local site.
   There will also be an IGP route to the generic {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16
   prefix, which will be a route to the site's 6to4 router, unless this
   is handled as a default route.

   EGP (i.e. BGP) routing will include advertisements for the
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 prefix from relay routers into the native IPv6
   realm, whose scope is limited by routing policy. This is the only
   non-native IPv6 prefix advertised by BGP.

   It will be necessary for 6to4 routers to obtain routes to relay
   routers in order to access the native IPv6 realm. In the simplest
   case there will be a manually configured default IPv6 route to
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=V4ADDR}/48, where V4ADDR is the IPv4 address
   of a relay router. Such a route can be used to establish a BGP
   session for the exchange of additional IPv6 routes.

   Note that nothing except careful engineering can prevent incongruent
   routing, in which the physical path followed by IPv6 traffic from A
   to B is different from the physical path followed by IPv4 traffic.
   By construction, unicast IPv6 traffic within a 6to4 domain will
   follow exactly the same path as IPv4 traffic. However, multicast
   traffic may follow an incongruent path, and when relay routers are in
   use, paths will be congruent only if relay routers are positioned and
   configured appropriately. This does not affect connectivity, but may
   affect performance and operations.

6. Multicast and Anycast

   It is not possible to assume the general availability of wide-area
   IPv4 multicast, so (unlike [6OVER4]) the 6to4 mechanism must assume
   only unicast capability in its underlying IPv4 carrier network.
   However, nothing prevents IPv6 multicast packets being sent to or
   sourced from a 6to4 router encapsulated in IPv4 unicast packets
   exactly as defined in Section 4. An IPv6 multicast routing protocol
   MUST be used.

   PIM needs a unicast routing protocol to provide the base for the RPF.
   Thus 6to4 routers should assume they are directly attached to
   <FP=001, TLA624>/16 prefix, i.e. they should inject such a unicast
   route into their site for the purposes of multicast routing.

   Similarly, 6to4 routers will use PIM among themselves (including
   relay routers) to determine off-site multicast forwarding paths.

   However, an IPv6 multicast tree that covers both 6to4 and non-6to4
   sites is likely to have a sub-optimal topology. If it has a single
   branch in the 6to4 address space, the multicast packets are likely to
   traverse large regions of the IPv4 network as well as corresponding
   regions of the IPv6 network. If the tree has multiple branches in the

Carpenter + Moore        Expires December 1999                 [Page 13]

Internet Draft Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds      June 1999

   6to4 address space, 6to4 encapsulation of the same multicast packet
   will take place multiple times.

   The allocated anycast address space [ANYCAST] is compatible with
   TLA624 prefixes.

7. ICMP messages

   ICMP "unreachable" and other messages returned by the IPv4 routing
   system will be returned to the 6to4 router that generated a
   encapsulated TLA624 packet. However, this router will often be unable
   to return an ICMPv6 message to the originating IPv6 node, due to the
   lack of sufficient information in the "unreachable" message. This
   means that the IPv4 network will appear as an undiagnosable link
   layer for IPv6 operational purposes. Other considerations are as
   described in Section 4.1.3 of [RFC 1933].

8. IANA considerations

   No assignments by the IANA are required except the special TLA value
   TLA624 = 0x0010.   [*** value to be confirmed ***]

9. Security considerations

   Implementors should be aware that, in addition to posssible attacks
   against IPv6, security attacks against IPv4 must also be considered.
   Use of IP security at both IPv4 and IPv6 levels should nevertheless
   be avoided, for efficiency reasons.  For example, if IPv6 is running
   encrypted, encryption of IPv4 would be redundant except if traffic
   analysis is felt to be a threat.  If IPv6 is running authenticated,
   then authentication of IPv4 will add little.  Conversely, IPv4
   security will not protect IPv6 traffic once it leaves the 6to4
   domain. Therefore, implementing IPv6 security is required even if
   IPv4 security is available.

   By default, 6to4 traffic will be accepted and decapsulated from any
   source from which regular IPv4 traffic is accepted.  If this is for
   any reason felt to be a security risk (for example, if IPv6 spoofing
   is felt to be more likley than IPv4 spoofing), then additional
   source-based packet filtering could be applied. A possible
   plausibility check is whether the encapsulating IPv4 address is
   consistent with the encapsulated TLA624 address. If this check is
   applied, exceptions to it must be configured to admit traffic from
   relay routers (Section 5).  TLA624 traffic must also be excepted from
   checks applied to prevent spoofing of "6 over 4" traffic [6OVER4].
