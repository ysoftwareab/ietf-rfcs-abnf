Abstract 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to gives a broad picture of the existing 
   proposed EAP methods, with a focus on shared key EAP methods. Indeed, 
   it is the belief of the author that a standard replacement for EAP-
   MD5 (that is deprecated due to security reasons) is needed. By 
   listing the existing shared key EAP methods, the goal is to gather 
   consensus that such a multiplication of methods is detrimental and 
   that a single methods retaining the best of the existing proposals 
   could and should be drafted.

INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Methods Synthesis         April 2004 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
1.1 Purpose of this document 
    
   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [EAP], provides an 
   authentication framework which supports multiple authentication 
   methods. EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as 
   PPP [PPP] or IEEE 802 thanks to the IEEE 802.1X [IEEE 802.1X] 
   framework., without requiring IP. 
    
   EAP supports many authentication mechanisms usually called EAP 
   methods. 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to gives a broad picture of the existing 
   proposed EAP methods, with a focus on shared key EAP methods.  
    
   Although this has already done before, see [EAP-METHSTAT1] and [EAP-
   METHSTAT2], it appeared worth doing the exercise thoroughly again 
   with a view towards requesting the opening of a work item at IETF, 
   namely replacing EAP-MD5. 
    
   Indeed, EAP methods have proliferated but only 4 are currently 
   standardized - namely EAP-MD5, EAP-OTP and EAP-GTC in [EAP] and EAP-
   TLS in [EAP-TLS]. Due new security requirements, expressed for 
   instance in IEEE 802 EAP Method Requirements for Wireless LANs [IEEE 
   802REQ], EAP-MD5 has been deprecated: it does neither provide mutual 
   authentication nor key derivation. However, no simple shared key EAP 
   method seems to be widely available to replace EAP-MD5. 
    
   In parallel to a proposition for such a replacement ([EAP-PSK]), a 
   documentation effort has been undertaken (see [EAP-SKMDTEMPL]) to 
   assess the different proposals, confirm that no standard replacement 
   for EAP-MD5 exists and open the way for such a replacement by 
   allowing comparison/merger of the existing related work. This 
   document is the synthesis of this effort. 
    
1.2 Material used for this document 
    
   This document has been elaborated thanks to: 
     o The responses received to [EAP-SKMDTEMPL] that was posted March 
        2004 to the EAP mailing list 
     o Investigation of the PPP EAP Request/Response Types registered 
        by IANA ([IANA]) 
     o Investigation of the methods quoted in [EAP-METHSTAT2] 
    
   Although it is the intention of the author of this document to gather 
   all the material relevant to EAP methods on a single location on the 
   Internet, the readers might want to use the following URLs to

   aforementioned location is still under construction:

     o http://www.watersprings.org/pub/id/ 
    
1.3 Organization of this document 
    
   Section 2 is devoted to briefly present and analyze each proposed 
   shared key EAP method the author of this document is aware of. 
    
   Following this review, conclusions are drawn in section 3. After a 
   brief review of the methods studied in section 2 for the sake of 
   clarity to allow the impatient reader to directly jump to section 3 
   without reading section 2, a tentative conclusion on shared key EAP 
   methods in general and replacement of EAP-MD5 in particular is 
   proposed in this section, followed by miscellaneous points on 
   alternative subjects noted while writing this document. 
    
   Section 4 is included for the sake of exhaustively and consists in a 
   brief review of the other existing non shared key EAP methods. This 
   review had to be done to ensure that the methods mentioned in this 
   section were indeed not shared key methods and thus did not belong to 
   section 2. 
    
   Within section 2 and 4, the EAP methods have been listed starting by 
   those who have been attributed an EAP type number by IANA presented 
   in increasing type number order, followed by those who have not, 
   presented in alphabetical order according to their name. 
    
   The other sections are the typical ones of an Internet Draft. 
    
1.4 Caveats 
    
   Though, the intention of this document was mainly to document the 
   existing shared key EAP methods, the borderline between documenting 
   and commenting upon was sometimes blurred. This was further 
   complicated by the obvious potential bias of the author (who is 
   himself the author of a proposed shared key EAP method, EAP-PSK). As 
   the draft may evolve, this will be clarified (i.e. the analysis parts 
   will be more clearly separated from the documentation ones and will 
   be deepened). In the meanwhile, the reader is advised to 
   differentiate in this document between facts and what may be 
   considered opinions. Comments to help separate facts from opinions as 
   well as to include other opinions are more than welcome! 
    
   In addition, gathering documentation and digesting it did not prove 
   to be that simple. Hence, this document may unfortunately contain 
   some errors. Readers are encouraged to report any error they feel

   they have spotted (especially if they are authors of an EAP method 
   and are dissatisfied with the treatment their method has received). 
    
   It was especially difficult to find out whether a method was still 
   being developed or not as well as whether a method had been 
   implemented. Hopefully future versions of this draft will clarify 
   this. 
    
   Last, the reader not familiar with the Internet Draft process is 
   reminded that this document is only (for now) the expression of the 
   work of an individual and by no way the expression of a consensus of 
   the community. It is however the intention of the author that this 
   document evolve from the understanding and appreciation of a single 
   person to the statement of the point of view of the community. 
    
2. Review of the proposed shared key EAP methods 
    
   This section presents the different existing shared key EAP methods 
   the author is aware of. These methods have been a priori deemed 
   relevant for the drafting of a replacement for EAP-MD5. 
    
2.1 EAP-MD5 
    
   Please refer to [EAP] and [EAPbis] for a description of EAP-MD5, 
   which is thus a standardized method. This method has also been widely 
   implemented. 
    
   EAP-MD5 must have been included in [EAPbis] for backward 
   compatibility, since [EAPbis] clearly presents the totally 
   insufficient security claims of this method (I am not sure it was 
   even a good idea to include this method in [EAPbis] but this is 
   another debate, see for instance Issue 174 of the EAP Issues List 
   [EAPIssues]). 
    
   Apart from the issues already mentioned on EAP-MD5 and that are far 
   enough to deprecate it (namely: no mutual authentication, no key 
   derivation and high vulnerability to active brute-force/dictionary 
   attacks), I'd like to raise two additional minor ones. 
    
   First, in [CHAP], the length of the challenge does not appear to be 
   fixed ("The length of the Challenge Value depends upon the method 
   used to generate the octets, and is independent of the hash algorithm 
   used). My understanding is also that the response to CHAP is 
   Hash(Identifier||Secret||Challenge) where Hash denotes a hash 
   function. It is now well-known that it is not a good idea to 
   calculate the response this way (see [MDx]), even though the 
   appending the length of the message in MD5 thwarts the most trivial 
   extension attacks.

INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Methods Synthesis         April 2004 
 
 
   Second, cryptographers tend to deprecate MD5 in favor of, for 
   instance, SHA-1 because MD5 output is only 16 bytes and because 
   collisions have been found for the MD5 compression function. 
    
2.2 EAP-Cisco Wireless 
    
   EAP-Cisco Wireless is also known as LEAP (Lightweight EAP) which has 
   been registered to IANA by S. Norman (Cisco). 
    
   It is an undocumented proprietary method of Cisco, that was shared by 
   Cisco to participants in the CCX program. It has been reverse-
   engineered and analyzed (see [LEAP]). 
    
   EAP-Cisco Wireless is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP Type 
   17 by IANA. 
    
   It is a shared key method that builds on existing mechanisms (MS-
   CHAP). It has been found to be flawed due to cryptographic weaknesses 
   inherited from MS-CHAP and very poor dictionary/brute-force offline 
   attack resistance (see [LEAPVUL]). 
    
   There does not seem to be any intention to officially document EAP-
   Cisco Wireless or to modify it to remedy its known flaws. The plan 
   rather seems to be to develop a new and broader EAP method (namely 
   EAP-FAST, see section 2.10). EAP-Cisco Wireless has been implemented. 
    
2.3 EAP-SIM 
    
   SIM stands for Subscriber Identity Module (it is a concept imported 
   from the GSM world). 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by H. Haverinen (Nokia) and J. Salowey 
   (Cisco). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in February 2001 as an 
   individual Internet-Draft: draft-haverinen-pppext-eap-sim-00.txt. 
   Version 01 published April 2001, Version 02 published November 2001, 
   Version 03 published February 2002, Version 04 published June 2002, 
   Version 05 published June 2002, Version 06 published October 2002, 
   Version 07 published November 2002, Version 08 published December 
   2002, Version 09 published January 2003, Version 10 published 
   February 2003, Version 11 published June 2003 and Version 12 
   published October 2003 are still to be found on the Internet. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography that reuses the 
   GSM authentication infrastructure. Although it could be used without 
   a SIM (e.g. with a software virtual SIM) and therefore as a generic 
   shared key EAP method, it is my opinion that doing would not be 
   appropriate since EAP-SIM makes considerable effort to deal with the

INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Methods Synthesis         April 2004 
 
 
   limitation of the GSM authentication (e.g. 64 bit keys or unilateral 
   authentication). In case, one would however want to reuse such a 
   method as a generic shared key method, I suggest at least not 
   considering EAP-SIM but only EAP-AKA, which reuses the much more 
   evolved UMTS authentication scheme. 
    
   Regarding IPR, some IPR claims seem to be related to EAP-SIM, please 
   refer to:

        eap-sim.txt 
    
   EAP-SIM is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP Type 18 by IANA 
   (under the name Nokia IP smart card authentication). 
    
   EAP-SIM is quite mature and still being actively developed. It has 
   also been implemented. It is backed by the GSM and UMTS world (for 
   instance by the 3GPP and the GSMA). 
    
2.4 SRP-SHA1 
    
   SRP stands for secure remote password, which refers to a protocol 
   developed by Thomas Wu [SRP]. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by J. Carlson (Sun Microsystems), B. 
   Aboba (Microsoft) and H. Haverinen (Nokia). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in December 2000 as a PPPEXT WG 
   Internet-Draft: draft-ietf-pppext-eap-srp-00.txt. 
    
   Version 01 published March 2001, version 02 published June 2001 and 
   version 03 published July 2001 are still to be found on the Internet. 
   Hints to a version 04 may be found on the Internet but I did not 
   manage to find the corresponding draft. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography and asymmetric 
   key cryptography to provide strong password only authenticated key 
   exchange. This method is quite similar to EAP-SPEKE, please refer to 
   section 2.9 for a discussion. 
    
   Regarding IPR, some IPR claims seem to be related to SRP, please 
   refer to:

   SRP-SHA1 is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP Type 19 and 20 
   by IANA. 
    
   It is unclear whether this method is still being developed or not. 
   According to [EAP-METHSTAT1], part of this method is claimed to have 
   been implemented. 
    
2.5 EAP-AKA 
    
   AKA stands for Authentication and Key Agreement (it is a concept 
   imported from the UMTS world). Where the GSM world uses the SIM, the 
   UMTS world uses the USIM which stands for UMTS SIM. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by J. Arkko (Ericsson) and H. Haverinen 
   (Nokia). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in May 2001 as an individual 
   Internet-Draft: draft-arkko-pppext-eap-aka-00.txt. Version 01 
   published November 2001, Version 03 published February 2002, Version 
   04 published June 2002, Version 05 published October 2002, Version 06 
   published November 2002, Version 07 published December 2002, Version 
   08 published January 2003, Version 09 published February 2003, 
   Version 10 published June 2003 and Version 11 published October 2003 
   are still to be found on the Internet. I did not manage to find the 
   Version 02 on the Internet. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography that reuses the 
   UMTS authentication infrastructure. Although it could be used without 
   an USIM (e.g. with a software virtual USIM) and therefore as a 
   generic shared key EAP method, it is my opinion that doing would not 
   be most appropriate. However, in the case of EAP-AKA, I must confess 
   that this opinion is rather a matter of taste, regarding for instance 
   its potential complexity and its design compared to the ones of a 
   standalone shared key EAP method. Further technical and scientific 
   investigation is needed to confirm or infirm this opinion. 
    
   Regarding IPR, an IPR claim seems to be related to EAP-AKA, please 
   refer to: 
    
     o http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/NOKIA-EAP.txt 
    
   Though I am not a lawyer, it seems that this claim does not really 
   encumber EAP-AKA. 
    
   EAP-SIM is quite mature and still being actively developed. It is 
   unclear whether it has been implemented. It is backed by the GSM and 
   UMTS world (for instance by the 3GPP and the GSMA).

2.6 MS-EAP-Authentication 
    
   MS stands for Microsoft. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by Vivek Kamath and Ashwin Palekar 
   (Microsoft). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in September 2002 as an 
   individual Internet-Draft: draft-kamath-pppext-eap-mschapv2-00.txt. 
    
   Hints to a version 01 may be found on the Internet but I did not 
   manage to find the corresponding draft. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography that reuses the 
   MS-CHAPv2 authentication protocol. It therefore bears the well-known 
   security flaws of the MS-CHAPv2 protocol, see [MSCHAPVUL]. An 
   interesting feature is though the password aging and changing 
   process. 
    
   MS-EAP-Authentication is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP 
   Type 26 by IANA. 
    
   This method does not seem to be any more under development, although 
   it would require some, at least to comply to the [EAPbis] and [EKMF]. 
   It has been implemented on Microsoft platforms. 
    
2.7 EAP MSCHAP-V2 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by D. Potter and J. Zamick (Cisco). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in January 2002 as an individual 
   Internet-Draft: draft-dpotter-pppext-eap-mschap-00.txt. 
    
   Hints to a version 01 may be found on the Internet but I did not 
   manage to find the corresponding draft. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography that reuses the 
   MS-CHAPv2 authentication protocol. It therefore bears the well-known 
   security flaws of the MS-CHAPv2 protocol, see [MSCHAPVUL]. This 
   method resembles very closely MS-EAP-Authentication. 
    
   EAP MSCHAP-V2 is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP Type 29 by 
   IANA. 
    
   This method does not seem to be any more under development, although 
   it would require some, at least to comply to the [EAPbis] and [EKMF]. 
   It is unclear whether it has been implemented.

2.8 EAP-HTTP Digest 
    
   EAP-HTTP Digest is an EAP method that has been registered to IANA by

   It is an undocumented EAP method, though some elements were kindly 
   provided by [EAPHTTPDigest]. 
    
   EAP-HTTP Digest is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP Type 38 
   by IANA. 
    
   EAP-HTTP Digest is a shared key method that allows HTTP Digest 
   authentication (defined in [HTTP-Digest]) to be offloaded from a 
   gateway to an AAA server. It is applicable for use with HTTP servers 
   as well as other protocols that use HTTP as a transport and require 
   HTTP digest authentication (e.g. SIP). 
    
   This protocol is not intended to be a shared key EAP method that 
   replaces EAP-MD5 Challenge, as per [EAPHTTPDigest]. It is rather 
   driven by legacy requirements (the definition of an authentication 
   method for HTTP that is not compatible with any existing RADIUS 
   credentials or EAP types). 
    
   It is unclear whether this method will be publicly specified and 
   whether it is implemented or not. 
    
2.9 EAP-SPEKE 
    
   SPEKE stands for simple password exponential key exchange. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by D. Jablon (Phoenix Technologies). The 
   actual EAP method was, as far as I know, never described. Hence, the 
   following text only alludes to the SPEKE scheme by itself. 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in February 2002 as an 
   individual Internet-Draft: draft-jablon-speke-00.txt. 
    
   Version 01 published April 2002 and version 02 published October 2002 
   are still to be found on the Internet.  
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography and asymmetric 
   key cryptography to provide strong password only authenticated key 
   exchange. 
    
   This method is quite similar to EAP-SRP. 
    
   From a security point of view, this method seems to definitely have a 
   better security level than EAP-PSK when a password is used because it 
   uses techniques specially designed to sophisticatedly deal with

   passwords (better than the classic tips provided in the Annex B of 
   [EAP-PSK], which are salting and iterating a hash function). A simple 
   presentation related to the more evolved techniques to deal with 
   password is available at [SRPpres]. 
    
   It would be interesting to investigate whether this increased 
   security level has some concrete impact on realistic usage scenarios 
   and whether it is necessary to provide such a strong password 
   support. The reasons why EAP-PSK did not choose to try and provide 
   strong password authentication in a similar way to SPEKE and SRP are: 
     o EAP-PSK wanted to rely on a single cryptographic primitive (AES) 
        whereas SPEKE or SRP have to use asymmetric cryptography 
     o EAP-PSK wanted to avoid any patent-encumbrance whereas SPEKE and 
        SRP seem to require clarification regarding their IPR status 
     o EAP-PSK left totally open the way the PSK would be stored (in a 
        human brain, in hardware or software containers,...) 
     o EAP-PSK felt that it could provide a decent level of security to 
        users that chose "reasonable" passwords (this point is of course 
        to be investigated, justified and clarified). 
    
   Regarding IPR, some IPR claims seem to be related to SPEKE, please 
   refer to:

   EAP-SPEKE is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP Type 41 by 
   IANA. 
    
   It is unclear whether this method will be publicly specified and 
   whether it is implemented or not. 
    
2.10 EAP-FAST 
    
   EAP-FAST stands for Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling 
   (EAP-FAST). 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by N.Cam-Winget, D. McGrew, J. Salowey 
   and H.Zhou (Cisco). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in February 2004 as an 
   individual Internet-Draft: draft-cam-winget-eap-fast-00.txt. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography and asymmetric 
   key cryptography that reuses the TLS mechanisms. EAP-FAST has some 
   nice features: 
     o ¸ TLV design that allows for extensibility 
     o ¸ Minimization of the per user authentication state requirement 
     o ¸ Handling of legacy equipment (use of TLS and MSCHAPv2) 
     o   Fragmentation support

     o ¸ Crypto-binding to allow sequence of EAP methods 
    
   However, this protocol has in my opinion two main drawbacks: 
     o Cryptographic design: choices were made to reuse flawed 
        protocols (e.g. MSCHAPv2), new cryptographic designs were 
        introduced without any explanations and the enrollment procedure 
        is easily prone to attacks (especially in the anonymous Diffie-
        Hellman setting), which is acknowledged and justified by 
        simplicity arguments. The cryptographic design could have 
        benefited from the more evolved and secure password 
        authentication techniques (e.g. EAP-SRP and EAP-SPEKE). 
     o It is quite a heavy weight protocol since for instance it refers 
        to no less than 5 or 6 cryptographic primitives, namely a stream 
        cipher - RC4, a block cipher - AES and hash functions - MD4, MD5 
        and SHA-1, and focuses directly on tunneling.

   EAP-FAST is an EAP method that has been allocated EAP Type 43 by 
   IANA. 
    
   This method has been released very recently and should be further 
   developed and implemented. 
    
2.11 EAP-Archie 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by Jesse Walker (Intel) and Russ Housley 
   (Vigil Security). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in February 2003 as an 
   individual Internet-Draft: draft-jwalker-eap-archie-00.txt. 
    
   Version 01 published June 2003 is still to be found on the Internet. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography. It is very 
   closely related to EAP-PSK since it was the main source of 
   inspiration for EAP-PSK. 
    
   The main differences between EAP-Archie and EAP-PSK are: 
     o Some cryptographic changes (use of OMAC in EAP-PSK instead of 
        CBC-MAC that cannot handle variable length messages, use of a 
        key derivation scheme that has been proven to be secure in EAP-
        PSK, use of EAX to set up a protected channel, removal of the 
        AES key wrap algorithm from EAP-PSK)

     o Some design changes (e.g. use of a TLV format in EAP-PSK instead 
        of message types) 
    
   EAP-Archie will not be maintained and developed in the future ([EAP-
   Archie]), so EAP-PSK may be considered its successor in my opinion. 
   Some implementations of EAP-Archie have been available. 
    
2.12 EAP-GSS 
    
   GSS stands for Generic Security Service and is defined in RFC 2743. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by B. Aboba and D. Simon (Microsoft). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in December 1999 under the title 
   "PPP EAP GSS Authentication Protocol" as an individual Internet-
   Draft: draft-aboba-pppext-eapgss-00.txt. 
    
   Version 02 published November 2000, version 03 published February 
   2001, version 05 published July 2001, version 06 published August 
   2001, version 07 published August 2001, version 08 published 
   September 2001, version 09 published December 2001, version 10 
   published January 2002, version 11 published February 2002 and 
   version 12 published April 2002 are still to be found on the 
   Internet. Hints to a version 01 and 13 may be found on the Internet 
   but I did not manage to find the corresponding draft. 
    
   EAP-GSS enables the use of GSS-API mechanisms within EAP. As a 
   result, any GSS-API mechanism providing initial authentication can be 
   used with EAP GSS. Since some GSS-API mechanisms are shared key 
   mechanisms, further investigation is required on this method (since I 
   am currently not familiar with the GSS-API and GSS-API mechanisms). 
    
2.13 EAP-IKEv2 
    
   IKEv2 stands for Internet Key Exchangev2. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by H. Tschofenig and D. Kroeselberg 
   (Siemens) and Y. Ohba (Toshiba). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in April 2003 as an individual 
   Internet-Draft: draft-tschofenig-eap-ikev2-00.txt. 
    
   Version 01 published June 2003, version 02 published October 2003 and 
   version 03 published August 2004 are still to be found on the 
   Internet. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on the symmetric and asymmetric 
   cryptography of IKEv2.

INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Methods Synthesis         April 2004 
 
 
   Its main advantages consist in my opinion consist first in reusing a 
   protocol which security has received considerable expert review, 
   second reusing a protocol that could become widely implemented and 
   third benefiting from all the nice features provided by IKEv2 (mutual 
   authentication, key derivation, DoS resistance, fast reconnect, 
   fragmentation support,...). Further investigation is needed to assess 
   this proposal that would be more generic than a shared key method 
   replacing EAP-MD5 since it also allows for asymmetric credentials 
   such as certificates(in particular studying the goals and different 
   features of IKEv2 might be quite inspiring for EAP methods). 
    
2.14 EAP-LDAP 
    
   LDAP is an EAP method proposed by H. Mancini (Bridgewater Systems). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in June 2003 under the title 
   "EAP-LDAP Protocol" as an individual Internet-Draft: draft-mancini-
   pppext-eap-ldap-00.txt. 
    
   Hints to a version 01 may be found on the Internet but I did not 
   manage to find the corresponding draft. 
    
   This document specifies an EAP method to enable the use of EAP-MD5 
   even though there is no access to the user's clear text password 
   within an identity store. It merely uses the hash of the user's 
   password, hash which is stored within the identity store, as the key 
   to EAP-MD5. It thus inherits at least all the vulnerability of EAP-
   MD5 and therefore is not suitable as a replacement for EAP-MD5. 
    
2.15 EAP-MD5 Tunneled Authentication Protocol 
    
   EAP-MD5 Tunneled Authentication Protocol is an EAP method proposed by 
   Paul Funk (Funk Software). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in March 2003 under the title " 
   The EAP MD5-Tunneled Authentication Protocol " as an individual 
   Internet-Draft: draft-funk-eap-md5-tunneled-00.txt. 
    
   EAP-MD5-Tunneled is an EAP protocol designed for use as an inner 
   authentication protocol within a tunneling EAP protocol such as EAP-
   TTLS or PEAP. It is cryptographically equivalent to standard CHAP and 
   the EAP-MD5-Challenge protocol. Thus, EAP-MD5-Tunneled does not aim 
   at proposing a generic shared key EAP method but rather the issues 
   implied by tunneling EAP methods. In addition, EAP-MD5-Tunneled bears 
   at least the same cryptographic weaknesses as EAP-MD5 and therefore 
   is not suitable as a replacement for EAP-MD5.

   EAP-PSK stands for EAP-Pre Shared Key. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by F. Bersani (France Telecom R&D). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in January 2004 as an individual 
   Internet-Draft: draft-bersani-eap-psk-00.txt. 
    
   Version 01 published February 2004 is still to be found on the 
   Internet. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography. Its main design 
   goals are: 
     o Simplicity: It should be easy to implement and to deploy without 
        any pre-existing infrastructure 
     o Wide applicability: It should be possible to use this method to 
        authenticate over any network. In particular, it should be 
        suitable for IEEE 802.11 [IEEE 802.11] wireless LANs and thus 
        comply to IEEE 802 EAP Method Requirements for Wireless LANs 
        [IEEE 802REQ] 
     o Security: It should be conservative in its cryptographic design 
        and enjoy security proofs 
     o Extensibility: It should be possible to add to this method the 
        required extensions as their need appears 
     o Patent-avoidance: It should be free of any Intellectual Property 
        Right claims 
    
   It views itself as the successor of EAP-Archie. 
    
   It is intended to stimulate the debate on EAP-MD5 replacement and to 
   be a proposal for such a replacement. 
    
2.17 EAP-SKE 
    
   EAP-SKE stands for EAP Shared Key Exchange. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by L. Salgarelli (Bell Labs, Lucent 
   Technologies) as the editor and many other co-authors. 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in November 2001 as an 
   individual Internet-Draft: draft-salgarelli-pppext-eap-ske-00.txt. 
    
   Version 01 published April 2002, version 02 published November 2002 
   and version 03 published May 2003 are still to be found on the 
   Internet. Hints to a version 04 may be found on the Internet but I 
   did not manage to find the corresponding draft. 
    
   It is an EAP method based on symmetric cryptography. Its main focus 
   is, in my opinion, network efficiency in roaming situations.

   Work is going on between the authors of EAP-SKE and EAP-PSK to see if 
   forces could be joined to produce a common proposal for a shared key 
   method to the community [EAP-SKE]. 
    
2.18 EAP-SSC 
    
   SSC stands for Secured Smartcard Channel 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by P.Urien and M. Dandjinou (ENST). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in December 2003 under the title 
   "EAP-SSC Secured Smartcard Channel " as an individual Internet-Draft: 
   draft-urien-eap-ssc-00.txt. 
    
   Version 01 published June 2004 is still to be found on the Internet. 
    
   This document describes a means of setting up an EAP secured channel 
   between a smart card and an Authentication Server as well according 
   to an asymmetric key exchange model as a symmetric key exchange 
   model. This channel would permit to convey securely all other types 
   of payload between the smart card and the authentication server. 
    
   It is not clear what exactly makes the content of this document 
   specific to a smart card. It seems to me as though the proposed 
   protocol could be viewed as a generic symmetric and asymmetric 
   cryptography EAP method. If so, the proposed cryptographic mechanism 
   would require, in my opinion, expert review and justification to back 
   up their soundness since new mechanisms seem to be introduced without 
   justification. In addition, further investigation would be needed to 
   assess the pros and cons of this protocol. 
    
3. Conclusion 
    
3.1 The different existing shared key EAP methods 
    
   This section attempts to provide a summary of the pros and cons of 
   the existing shared key EAP methods listed in section 2. 
    
   EAP-MD5 has several security flaws that cannot be tolerated in the 
   new environments where EAP is intended to be used like WLANs (e.g. no 
   mutual authentication, no key derivation and high vulnerability to 
   active brute-force/dictionary attacks). However, it has some nice 
   features that might be worth keeping in mind: it is standardized and 
   it is simple. 
    
   EAP-Cisco Wireless also has security flaws that should not be 
   tolerated in the new environments where EAP is intended to be used 
   like WLANs and it is an undocumented proprietary method. However, it 

 
 
Bersani                 Expires û October 2004              [Page 17] 
INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Methods Synthesis         April 2004 
 
 
   should be remembered as a proof of the need for a shared key EAP 
   method as well as the feasibility of such a method. 
    
   MS-EAP-Authentication and EAP MSCHAPv2 unfortunately inherit, like 
   EAP-Cisco Wireless, the intolerable security flaws of the protocol 
   they are based on, namely MS-CHAPv2. A nice feature though to retain 
   from these methods is the password aging and changing process. 
    
   EAP-MD5 Tunneled Authentication Protocol also inherit the weaknesses 
   of EAP-MD5 and therefore cannot compete for its replacement. 
    
   EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA are not, in their design intention, generic 
   shared key EAP methods. However in case, one wants to use them as 
   such, EAP-SIM should be dropped in favor of EAP-AKA which is more 
   evolved. Whether EAP-AKA could or should be reused as a generic 
   shared key EAP method will be further investigated in the following 
   versions of this draft, although the current feeling is that it 
   should not. 
    
   EAP-HTTP Digest is a method designed to cope with legacy devices and 
   protocols that is not publicly specified. It should therefore not 
   impact the drafting of a replacement for EAP-MD5. 
    
   EAP-SRP and EAP-SPEKE are two very interesting methods for the 
   drafting of a replacement for EAP-MD5 that use evolved cryptography 
   to very efficiently deal with passwords. Further investigation is 
   needed to assess whether or not such efficiency with passwords is 
   required from a security point of view and whether it is possible to 
   move forward with such techniques while avoiding IPR claims. 
    
   EAP-FAST is also an interesting method to take into account. However 
   some choices it made seem to have been driven by a will to deal with 
   legacy devices and infrastructures (e.g. reusing MS-CHAPv2). Further 
   investigation is needed to determine whether dealing with legacy 
   equipment should be a goal in the drafting of a replacement for EAP-
   MD5. EAP-FAST also provide fragmentation support. This leads to 
   raising the question whether fragmentation support should be 
   supported by the replacement of EAP-MD5 (the answer might be yes in 
   my opinion since fragmentation support can probably be easily added 
   and leaves the method open for future extensions that could require 
   payloads larger than the MTU). 
    
   EAP-IKEv2 definitely requires further investigation to better 
   understand IKEv2 design goals and features and whether they suit EAP 
   well. 
    
   EAP-LDAP alludes to the possible problems that might arise when using 
   a standard existing database to store the users' credentials. 
   Similarly to EAP-FAST, further investigation is needed to see if 
 
 
Bersani                 Expires û October 2004              [Page 18] 
INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Methods Synthesis         April 2004 
 
 
   dealing with legacy devices and infrastructures should be a design 
   goal and if yes, how to deal with them. 
    
   EAP SSC needs further investigation to better understand its goals 
   and its capabilities as well as the security level it provides. 
    
   EAP GSS needs further investigation to assess to what extent it could 
   be used in conjunction with a GSS-API mechanism to be specified to 
   replace EAP MD5. The nice idea behind EAP GSS is the use of a generic 
   API to access a range of different authentication mechanisms, 
   although this might be redundant with EAP itself. 
    
   Hopefully, EAP-PSK (which may be considered EAP-Archie's successor 
   since EAP-Archie will not be further developed) and EAP-SKE will be 
   merging to propose a base draft to the community for replacing EAP-
   MD5. It is believed to have a sound security basis as well as a 
   simple and extensible design. 
    
3.2 General conclusion on shared key EAP methods 
    
   There is a wide range of existing shared key EAP methods which is 
   good since it demonstrates the creativity of the community but is 
   also dangerous since it first dilutes the review effort of the 
   community which might result in flawed or broken protocols and second 
   it does not help to provide interoperability. 
    
   Thanks to all the good ideas contained in the drafts mentioned in the 
   precedent section, it seems to be quite possible to draft a standard 
   replacement for EAP-MD5 that would retain the best of all worlds, 
   provided the community shows interest in doing so. 
    
   Further work is needed to better assess the status of the different 
   drafts mentioned in the precedent section and understand their pros 
   and cons (especially those of EAP-AKA, EAP-FAST, SRP-SHA1, EAP-SPEKE, 
   EAP GSS, EAP-PSK and EAP SSC). Hopefully, this will be done in future 
   versions of this document. 
    
   Most drafts do not comply to EAPbis or EKMF which understandable 
   since those documents were themselves evolving. 
    
   It would be a good idea to clarify the relationship between shared 
   key EAP methods and OTP methods (since they both tend to use the same 
   symmetric cryptography credentials). Hopefully, this will be done in 
   future versions of this document. 
    
3.3 Miscellaneous conclusions 
    
   Similar unification work could be done in the following areas:

     o OTP EAP methods (in case, they are deemed essentially different 
        from EAP methods as a result of the further investigations 
        announced in the previous subsection) 
     o Biometrics EAP method (since like OTP EAP methods, there are 
        numerous candidates available, yet none has acquired the 
        maturity and extent of a widespread standard) 
     o Public key EAP methods (although EAP-TLS has already emerged as 
        a standard) 
     o Hybrid methods (i.e. using public key on one side and private 
        key on the other side) 
    
   Such work could improve the quality of the methods and help users 
   find they way through the myriads of EAP methods! 
    
4. Review of the non shared key EAP methods 
    
   The EAP methods presented here have been included for the sake of 
   completeness: they are deemed totally irrelevant for the drafting of 
   a replacement for EAP-MD5. 
    
4.1 EAP-OTP 
    
   EAP-OTP stands for one-time password. 
    
   Please refer to [EAP] and [EAPbis] for a description of EAP-OTP, 
   which is thus a standardized method. 
    
   This EAP method has been defined for use with one-time password 
   systems. 
    
   Unfortunately, this method is quite simplistic and outdated (see for 
   instance the security claims in [EAPbis]). Therefore, this method is, 
   in my opinion, only specified for legacy reasons and its security and 
   functionality levels do not match the current requirements. 
    
4.2 EAP-GTC 
    
   EAP-GTC stands for generic token card. 
    
   Please refer to [EAP] and [EAPbis] for a description of EAP-GTC, 
   which is thus a standardized method. 
    
   This EAP method has been defined for use with various token card 
   implementations that require user input. It consists in a challenge 
   (containing a displayable message) and a response (containing the 
   data entered by the user from the token card). 
    
   Unfortunately, this method is so simplistic and outdated (since in 
   only a round-trip, it is quite hard to provide a good level of

   security - see for instance the security claims in [EAPbis]) that 
   many token cards have chosen to develop their own methods (see e.g. 
   section 4.8). Therefore, this method is, in my opinion, only

4.8 RSA Security SecurID EAP and SecurID EAP 
    
   Two EAP types have been allocated by IANA for RSA SecurID 
   authentication: type 15 and type 32. 
    
   Some documentation on these methods have been kindly communicated by 
   [RSA SecurID]. 
    
   EAP type 15 was developed for use with RSA Security clients and 
   Agents on the Windows platform. It is proprietary and may remain that 
   way. 
    
   Seeing the need for an open EAP type to support RSA Tokens, EAP type 
   32 has been reserved.

4.10 EAP-TTLS 
    
   EAP-TTLS stands for EAP Tunneled TLS Authentication Protocol. 
    
   It is an EAP method proposed by Paul Funk (Funk Software) and Simon 
   Blake-Wilson (Certicom). 
    
   The first version of it was proposed in August 2001 as a PPEXT WG 
   Internet-Draft: draft-ietf-pppext-eap-ttls-00.txt.

   IANA. 
    
   EAP-TTLS is an EAP method based on asymmetric cryptography reusing 
   TLS mechanisms. In EAP-TTLS, the TLS handshake may be mutual; or it 
   may be one-way, in which only the server is authenticated to the 
   client. The secure connection established by the handshake may then 
   be used to allow the server to authenticate the client using 
   existing, widely-deployed authentication infrastructures such as 
   RADIUS. The authentication of the client may itself be EAP, or it may 
   be another authentication protocol such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP or MS-
   CHAP-V2.

   PEAP is an EAP method based on asymmetric cryptography reusing TLS 
   mechanisms that has been allocated EAP Type 25 by IANA. 
    
   PEAP is an EAP method based on asymmetric cryptography reusing TLS 
   mechanisms which provides an encrypted and authenticated tunnel based 
   on transport layer security (TLS) that encapsulates EAP 
   authentication mechanisms. PEAP uses TLS to protect against rogue 
   authenticators, protect against various attacks on the 
   confidentiality and integrity of the inner EAP method exchange and 
   provide EAP peer identity privacy. EAP also provides support for 
   chaining multiple EAP mechanisms, cryptographic binding between 
   authentications performed by inner EAP mechanisms and the tunnel, 
   exchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs), optimized session 
   resumption, and fragmentation and reassembly.

   EAP-GPRS specifies an extension to EAP which allows GPRS clients to 
   perform signaling procedures with a core GPRS network through devices 
   that enforce EAP-based access control. For example, a GPRS client can 
   use EAP-GPRS to attach to a GPRS network through an access point that 
   enforces IEEE 802.1X access control. In this case, the GPRS attach 
   signaling is performed in the context of the underlying 802.1X 
   procedure and the GPRS messages are encapsulated into EAP-GPRS 
   packets. If the GPRS client is permitted to attach to the GPRS 
   network, then the 802.1X procedure ends successfully and the client 
   is authorized access to the access point. In general, EAP-GPRS allows 
   any type of signaling to take place during the EAP authentication as 
   an embedded signaling procedure.  
    
   It is not really an authentication method but rather a new transport 
   mechanism for higher-layer protocols.
