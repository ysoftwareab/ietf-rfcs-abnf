1. Status of this Memo

  This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all
  provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

  This document is intended to be, after appropriate review and
  revision, submitted to the RFC Editor as an Experimental document.
  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Technical discussion of this
  document will take place on the IETF LDAP Extensions Working Group
  mailing list <ietf-ldapext@netscape.com>.  Please send editorial
  comments directly to the author <Kurt@OpenLDAP.org>.

2. Abstract

  This document describes schema and mechanisms extending the
  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC 2251] to support the
  International Domain Name System [IDN].

  The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
  NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'',  and ``MAY'' in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
  [RFC2119].

3. Background and Intended Use

  Experimental internationalized domain name systems exist.  The IETF is
  actively engineering standards in this area.  Though this work is in
  progress, enough is known to experiment with international domain
  names in application protocols.


4. Domains use in LDAP

  Excepting user data transferred by the protocol (see Section 5), the
  only use of domain names within the URL returned in a Referral
  LDAPResult or SearchResultReference response PDU.  An ASCII Compatible
  Encoding (ACE) of the domain name is expected to be used for within
  hostpart of the URL.

  Use of internationalized domain names within URIs [IDNURI] and use of
  Internationalized Resource Identifiers [IRI] with LDAP is not
  discussed when this document.

5. International Domain Schema

  The schema described in this section is intended to be used similar to
  the schema described in [RFC2247] and [LOCATE] excepting that it is
  used conjunction with a International Domain Name System instead of
  the Internet Domain Name System and domain components are restricted
  to UTF-8 not IA5.

  This section defined internationalized versions of the domain related
  schema elements introduced in [RFC1274] and subsequently adapted for
  use with LDAP [RFC2247].

  Editor's Note: object identifiers (OIDs) will be assigned before this
                 document is published as an RFC.


5.1. International Domain Component

  The IDC (short for International Domain Component) attribute type is
  defined as follows:

       ( OID.TBD NAME 'IDC'
            EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
            SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
            SYNTAX directoryString
            SINGLE-VALUE )

  The value of this attribute is a string holding one component of an

  international domain name.  The encoding of directoryString for use in
  LDAP is simply the characters of the string itself.  The equality
  matching rule is case insensitive, as is today's IDN.


5.2. International Domain Component Object

  The idcObject object class permits the IDC attribute to be present in
  an entry.  This object class is defined as auxiliary, as it would
  typically be used in conjunction with an existing structural object
  class, such as organization, organizationalUnit or locality.

  The following object class, along with the IDC attribute, can be added
  to any entry.

     ( OID.TBD NAME 'idcObject'
            AUXILIARY MUST IDC )

  An example entry would be:

       dn: IDC=example,IDC=com
       objectClass: top
       objectClass: organization
       objectClass: idcObject
       IDC: example
       o: Example Organization


6. Security Considerations

  This document describes how attributes of objects may be discovered
  and retrieved.  Servers should ensure that an appropriate security
  policy is maintained.

  An enterprise is not restricted in the information which it may store
  in DNS or LDAP servers.  A client which contacts an untrusted server
  may have incorrect or misleading information returned (e.g.  an
  organization's server may claim to hold naming contexts representing
  domain names which have not been delegated to that organization).
