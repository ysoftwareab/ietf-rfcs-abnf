ABSTRACT

   This document describes the RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable
   Rate Codec (EVRC) Speech.  The packet format supports various formats
   for different application scenarios. An bundled/interleaved format is
   included to reduce the effect of packet loss on Speech quality. A
   non-bundled format is also supported for conversational applications.

1. Introduction

   This document describes how compressed EVRC speech as produced by the
   EVRC CODEC [1] may be formatted for use as an RTP payload type.
   Methods are provided to packetize the codec data frames into RTP
   packets, in bundled/interleaved and zero-header format. The sender
   may choose among various formats the best solutions for different
   application scenario based on the network condition, bandwidth
   restriction, delay requirements and packet-loss tolerance.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


2. Background

   The Electronic Industries Association (EIA) & Telecommunications
   Industry Association (TIA) standard IS-127 [1] defines a speech
   compression algorithm for use in cdma2000 applications.  IS-127, or
   EVRC is the emerging speech codec standard for cdma2000.

   The EVRC CODEC [1] compresses each 20 milliseconds of 8000 Hz, 16-
   bit sampled input speech into one of three different size output
   frames: Rate 1 (171 bits), Rate 1/2 (80 bits), or Rate 1/8 (16 bits).
   The CODEC chooses the output frame rate based on analysis of the
   input speech and the current operating mode (either normal or one of
   several reduced rates).  For typical speech patterns, this results in
   an average output of 4.2 K bits/sec for normal mode and lower for
   reduced rate modes.

3. RTP/EVRC Packet Format

   The RTP timestamp is in 1/8000 of a second units.  The RTP payload
   data for the EVRC CODEC the following two types.

3.1 Type 1 RTP/EVRC Packet Format

   This format is for the situation that the sender and the receiver
   intending to uses interleaving and/or bundling to send one or more
   than one codec frames per packet. The RTP packet for this format is
   as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                      RTP Header [2]                           |
   +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+
   | RR| LLL | NNN |                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+     one or more ToC entries     +-------------+
   |                                                 |             |
   +-------------------------------------------------+             |
   |                                                               |
   |                  one or more codec data frames                |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The RTP header has the expected values as described in [2]. The M bit
   should be set as specified in the applicable RTP profile, for
   example, RFC 1890. Note that RFC 1890 specifies that if the sender
   does not suppress silence (i.e., sends a frame on every 20
   millisecond interval) the M bit will always be zero. When multiple
   codec data frames are present in a single RTP packet, the timestamp
   is, as always, that of the oldest data represented in the RTP packet.
   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is
   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular class of
   applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if that
   is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be chosen.

   The fields of the interleaving byte have the following meaning:

   Reserved (RR): 2 bits
      MUST be set to zero by sender, SHOULD be ignored by receiver.

   Interleave (LLL): 3 bits
      MUST have a value between 0 and 7 inclusive.

   Interleave Index (NNN): 3 bits
      MUST have a value less than or equal to the value of LLL.  Values
      of NNN greater than the value of LLL are invalid.

INTERNET-DRAFT   An RTP Payload Format for EVRC Speech    July 11, 2001


   Table of Content field (ToC) contains the indexes for the codec data
   frame(s) in the packet. There is one entry for each codec data frame.

   More than one codec data frame MAY be included in a single RTP packet
   by a sender. The data frames may be included in one of the two
   manners: bundled or interleaved. Bundling of the codec data frames is
   described in detail in Section 5, and interleaving in Section 6.

3.2 Type 2 RTP/EVRC Packet Format

   The Type 2 RTP/EVRC Packet Format are designed for maximum efficiency
   in transmission of the EVRC codec data. Only one codec data frame is
   sent with each RTP packet, and there is no ToC field prefix the codec
   data. The EVRC codec rate of the data frame can be found out at the
   receiver from the length of the codec frame, since there is only one
   codec data frame in each RTP packet for this type.

   The RTP header for Type 2 RTP/EVRC Packet Format is the same as
   described in Section 3.1 for Type 1 RTP/EVRC Packet Format.


    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


3.3 Detection Between the Type 1 and Type 2 Packets

   All receivers MUST be able to process both types of packets. The
   sender MAY choose to use one or both types of packets.

   The packets of the two types can be destinguished by the payload type
   field in the RTP header. The association of payload type number with
   the packet type is done out-of-band, for example by SDP during the
   setup of a session.


4. Packet Table of Content Entries and CODEC Data Frame Format

4.1 Packet Table of Content entries

   For each of the codec data frames in the packet in Type 1 packets,
   there is a Table of Content (ToC) entry associated with it. The ToC
   entry indicates whether interleaving is present, if rate reduction is
   desired, if there are more entries following the current one, and the
   rate of the corresponding codec frame. Type 2 packets do NOT have the


Adam H. Li                                                      [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT   An RTP Payload Format for EVRC Speech    July 11, 2001


   ToC field, since there is always only one codec data frame in each
   Type 2 packet.

   Each ToC entry is one octet in size. The format of the octet is
   indicated below:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |F|D|  frm type |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Further Entry Indication (F): 1 bit
      Indicate if there are more ToC entries following the current on
      or the current one is the last in the ToC entry field. F = 1
      indicates there are more ToC entries following. F = 0 indicates
      that the current entry is the last one in ToC.

   Reduce Rate (D): 1 bit
      Setting the 'D' bit indicates that this packet is requesting a
      reduced codec rate for the reverse direction. When the 'D' bit is
      not set the packet is requesting that the codec resume normal
      operation.  In the case of packet loss the codec should continue
      to operate in the mode indicated by the last packet received.
      Receivers are not required to respond to the Reduce Rate signal.
      (See more discussion in Section 8.2).

   Frame Type: 6 bits
      The frame type values are described in the table below and the
      size of the associated packet is indicated in the table below:

      Value   RATE      TOTAL CODEC data frame size (in octets)
      ---------------------------------------------------------
        0     Blank      0
        1     1/8        2
        3     1/2       10
        4     1         22
       14     Erasure    0    (SHOULD NOT be transmitted by sender)

      Receipt of a ToC entry with a reserved value in Frame Type MUST
      be considered invalid data.  All values not listed in the above
      table MUST be considered reserved.

4.2 The Codec Data Frame

   The output of the EVRC CODEC must be converted into CODEC data frames
   for inclusion in the RTP payload as follows:

   The bits as numbered in the standard [1] from the lowest to the
   highest are packed into octets.  The lowest numbered bit (bit 1 for
   Rate 1, Rate 1/2 and Rate 1/8) is placed in the most significant bit
   (Internet bit 0) of octet 1 of the CODEC data frame, the second
   lowest bit is placed in the second most significant bit of the first
   octet, the third lowest in the third most significant bit of the

Adam H. Li                                                      [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT   An RTP Payload Format for EVRC Speech    July 11, 2001


   first octet, and so on.  This continues until all of the bits have
   been placed in the CODEC data frame.  The remaining unused bits of
   the last octet of the CODEC data frame MUST be set to zero (note that
   this is only applicable to rate 1 frames as the others fit completely
   into a whole number of octets).

   Here is a detail of how a Rate 1 frame is converted into a CODEC data
   frame:

   The codec data frame for a Rate 1 frame is 22 byte long. Bits 1
   through 171 from the standard Rate 1 frame are placed as indicated
   with bits marked with "Z" being set to zero.  The Rate 1/8 and 1/2
   standard frames are converted similarly but do not require zero
   padding because they align on octet boundaries.

                    Rate 1 CODEC data frame (bytes 0 - 3)

    0                   1                   2                   3

5. Bundling Codec Data Frames in Type 1 Packets

   As indicated in section 3.1, more than one codec data frame MAY be
   included in a single RTP packet by a sender. Bundling codec data
   frames means multiple data frames are included consecutively in a
   packets without interleaving. The bundling of codec data frames is
   signaled by setting the LLL value in the Interleaving Byte to 0.

   Senders MAY support bundling. All receivers MUST support bundling.
   Receivers MAY signal the maximum number of codec data frames they can
   handle in a single RTP packet.

   Furthermore, senders have the following additional restrictions:

   o  MUST never bundle more more codec data frames in a single RTP
      packet than signaled by maxptime in Section 9.

Adam H. Li                                                      [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT   An RTP Payload Format for EVRC Speech    July 11, 2001



   o  SHOULD not bundle more codec data frames in a single RTP packet
      than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol.  For the
      purpose of computing the maximum bundling value, all CODEC data
      frames should be assumed to have the Rate 1 size.

   Since no count is transmitted as part of the RTP payload and the
   codec data frames have differing lengths, the only way to determine
   how many codec data frames are present in the RTP packet is to
   examine the ToC field of the RTP packet until the entry with M bit
   set to 0 is reached.


6. Interleaving Codec Data Frames in Type 1 Packets

   Senders MAY support interleaving. All receivers MUST support
   interleaving. Receivers MAY signal the maximum number of codec data
   frames they can handle in a single RTP packet. Interleaving of codec
   data frames is signaled by setting the LLL value in the Interleaving
   Byte to a value between 1 and 7 inclusive.

   Given a time-ordered sequence of output frames from the EVRC CODEC
   numbered 0..n, a bundling value B, and an interleave value L where n
   = B * (L+1) - 1, the output frames are placed into RTP packets as
   follows (the values of the fields LLL and NNN are indicated for each
   RTP packet):

   First RTP Packet in Interleave group:
      LLL=L, NNN=0
      Frame 0, Frame L+1, Frame 2(L+1), Frame 3(L+1), ... for a total of
      B frames

   Second RTP Packet in Interleave group:
      LLL=L, NNN=1
      Frame 1, Frame 1+L+1, Frame 1+2(L+1), Frame 1+3(L+1), ... for a
      total of B frames

   This continues to the last RTP packet in the interleave group:

   L+1 RTP Packet in Interleave group:
      LLL=L, NNN=L
      Frame L, Frame L+L+1, Frame L+2(L+1), Frame L+3(L+1), ... for a
      total of B frames

   Senders MUST transmit in timestamp-increasing order.  Furthermore,
   within each interleave group, the RTP packets making up the
   interleave group MUST be transmitted in value-increasing order of the
   NNN field.  While this does not guarantee reduced end-to-end delay on
   the receiving end, when packets are delivered in order by the
   underlying transport, delay will be reduced to the minimum possible.




Adam H. Li                                                      [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT   An RTP Payload Format for EVRC Speech    July 11, 2001


   Additionally, senders have the following restrictions:

   o  Once beginning a session with a given maximum interleaving value
      set by maxinterleave in Section 9, MUST NOT increase the
      interleaving value exceeding the maximum interleaving the value
      that is signaled.

   o  MAY change the interleaving value only between interleave groups.

6.1 Finding Interleave Group Boundaries

   Given an RTP packet with sequence number S, interleave value (field
   LLL) L, and interleave index value (field NNN) N, the interleave
   group consists of RTP packets with sequence numbers from S-N to S-N+L
   inclusive.  In other words, the Interleave group always consists of
   L+1 RTP packets with sequential sequence numbers.  The bundling value
   for all RTP packets in an interleave group MUST be the same.

   The receiver determines the expected bundling value for all RTP
   packets in an interleave group by the number of CODEC data frames
   bundled in the first RTP packet of the interleave group received.
   Note that this may not be the first RTP packet of the interleave
   group sent if packets are delivered out of order by the underlying
   transport.

   On receipt of an RTP packet in an interleave group with other than
   the expected bundling value, the receiver MAY discard CODEC data
   frames off the end of the RTP packet or add erasure CODEC data frames
   to the end of the packet in order to manufacture a substitute packet
   with the expected bundling value.  The receiver MAY instead choose to
   discard the whole interleave group and play silence.

6.2 Reconstructing Interleaved Speech

   Given an RTP sequence number ordered set of RTP packets in an
   interleave group numbered 0..L, where L is the interleave value and B
   is the bundling value, and CODEC data frames within each RTP packet
   that are numbered in order from first to last with the numbers 1..B,
   the original, time-ordered sequence of output frames from the CODEC
   may be reconstructed as follows:

   First L+1 frames:
      Frame 0 from packet 0 of interleave group
      Frame 0 from packet 1 of interleave group
      And so on up to...
      Frame 0 from packet L of interleave group

   Second L+1 frames:
      Frame 1 from packet 0 of interleave group
      Frame 1 from packet 1 of interleave group
      And so on up to...
      Frame 1 from packet L of interleave group


Adam H. Li                                                      [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT   An RTP Payload Format for EVRC Speech    July 11, 2001


   And so on up to...

   Bth L+1 frames:
      Frame B from packet 0 of interleave group
      Frame B from packet 1 of interleave group
      And so on up to...
      Frame B from packet L of interleave group

6.3 Receiving Invalid Interleaving Values

   On receipt of an RTP packet with an invalid value of the LLL or NNN
   field, the RTP packet MUST be treated as lost by the receiver for the
   purpose of generating erasure frames as described in Section 7.

6.4 Additional Receiver Responsibilities

   Assume that the receiver has begun playing frames from an interleave
   group.  The time has come to play frame x from packet n of the
   interleave group.  Further assume that packet n of the interleave
   group has not been received.  As described in section 7, an erasure
   frame will be sent to the EVRC CODEC.

   Now, assume that packet n of the interleave group arrives before
   frame x+1 of that packet is needed.  Receivers SHOULD use frame x+1
   of the newly received packet n rather than substituting an erasure
   frame.  In other words, just because packet n wasn't available the
   first time it was needed to reconstruct the interleaved speech, the
   receiver SHOULD NOT assume it's not available when it's subsequently
   needed for interleaved speech reconstruction.


7. Handling Lost RTP Packets

   The EVRC CODEC supports the notion of erasure frames.  These are
   frames that for whatever reason are not available.  When
   reconstructing interleaved speech or playing back non-interleaved
   speech, erasure frames MUST be fed to the EVRC CODEC for all of the
   missing packets.

   Receivers MUST use the timestamp clock to determine how many CODEC
   data frames are missing.  Each CODEC data frame advances the
   timestamp clock EXACTLY 160 counts.

   Since the bundling/interleaving value may vary, the timestamp clock
   is the only reliable way to calculate exactly how many CODEC data
   frames are missing when a packet is dropped.

   Specifically when reconstructing interleaved speech, a missing RTP
   packet in the interleave group should be treated as containing B
   erasure CODEC data frames where B is the bundling value for that
   interleave group.

8. Implementation Issues

8.1 Interleaving Length

   The EVRC CODEC interpolates the missing speech content when given an
   erasure frame.  However, the best quality is perceived by the
   listener when erasure frames are not consecutive.  This makes
   interleaving desirable as it increases speech quality when dropped
   packets are more likely.

   On the other hand, interleaving can greatly increase the end-to-end
   delay.  Where an interactive session is desired, the non-interleaved
   RTP payload type is recommended.

   When end-to-end delay is not a concern, an interleaving value (field
   LLL) of 4 or 5 is recommended subject to MTU limitations.

   The parameters maxbundle and maxinterleaving at the initial setup of
   the session guarantees that the receiver can allocate a well-known
   amount of buffer space at the beginning of the session that will be
   sufficient for all future reception in that session. Less buffer
   space may be required at some point in the future if the sender
   decreases the bundling value or interleaving value, but never more
   buffer space.  This prevents the possibility of the receiver needing
   to allocate more buffer space (with the possible result that none is
   available).

8.2 Signaling of Reduce Rate

   The reduce rate signal requests reducing of the codec rate on the
   reverse direction. It is not required that all implementations to be
   able to react to the Reduce rate signal. If an implementation will
   react to the Reduce rate signal, it MUST be able to process/react to
   the D bit in Type 1 packets. The Reduce Rate signal should only be
   used in one-to-one sessions. In multiparty sessions, all the received
   Reduce Rate signal MUST be discarded.

   In additional, the Reduce rate signal may also be sent through non-
   RTP means, which is out of the scope of this specification.


9. The EVRC MIME Type Registration

   The MIME-name for the EVRC codec is allocated from the IETF tree
   since EVRC is expected to be a widely used codec for voice-over-IP
   applications.

   The RTP mode has been described in the previous sections.

9.1 Storage Mode

   The storage mode is used for storing speech frames, e.g. as a file or
   e-mail attachment.

Adam H. Li                                                     [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT   An RTP Payload Format for EVRC Speech    July 11, 2001



   The file begins with a magic number to identify that it is an EVRC
   file. The magic number for EVRC corresponds to the ASCII character
   string "#!EVRC\n", i.e., 0x2321455652430a.

   The speech codec frames are stored in consecutive order with the TOC
   entry byte prefix each codec frame data.

   Speech frames lost in transmission and non-received frames MUST be
   stored as erasure frames (frame type 14, see definition in Section
   4.1) to keep synchronization with the original media.

9.2 EVRC MIME Registration

   Media Type Name:     audio

   Media Subtype Name:  EVRC

   Required Parameters:

      ptype:    It is the type of the RTP/EVRC packets. The valid
         values are 1 or 2.

   Optional parameters for RTP mode:

      ptime:    Defined as usual for RTP audio.

      maxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated
         in each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds. The time
         shall be calculated as the sum of the time the media present
         in the packet represents. The time SHOULD be a multiple of the
         frame size. If not signalled, the default maxptime value is
         200 milliseconds.

      maxinterleave: Maximum number for interleaving value. The
         interleaving values used in the entire session should not
         exceed this maximum value. If not signalled, the maxinterleave
         value is 5.

   Optional parameters for storage mode: none

   Encoding considerations for RTP mode: see Section 5 and Section 6 of
      this document.

   Encoding considerations for storage mode: The EVRC speech frames are
      packed into consecutive compound EVRC payloads, see Section 5 and
      Section 6. The compound EVRC payloads must be stored in
      sequential order. Furthermore, missing frames and non-received
      frames during non-speech period must be encapsulated into a
      compound EVRC payload as blank frames or erasures. Each receiving
      entity that accepts this MIME type must be able to decode all
      EVRC coding modes.

10. Mapping to SDP Parameters

   Please note that this chapter applies to the RTP mode only.

   Parameters are mapped to SDP [5] as usual.
   Example usage in SDP:
     m = audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
     a = rtpmap:97 EVRC
     a = fmtp:97 ptype=1; maxptime=4


11. Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [2], and any appropriate profile (for example [4]).
   This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by
   encryption.  Because the data compression used with this payload
   format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed after
   compression so there is no conflict between the two operations.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
   be overloaded.  However, this encoding does not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity.

   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances, a receiver may
   be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either
   desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to
   discard packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of

   the authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast
   environment, pruning of specific sources may be implemented in
   future versions of IGMP [6] and in multicast routing protocols to
   allow a receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach it.
