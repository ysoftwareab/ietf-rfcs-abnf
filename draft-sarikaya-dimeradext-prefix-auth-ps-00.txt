Internet-Draft      PS:Diameter Prefix Authorization           July 2008


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   Prefix assignment for an IPv6 node (host or router) is essential to
   IPv6 address formulation.  Even though IPv6 address space is large
   enough, it still makes sense for operators to manage addresses in a
   central way, e.g. using central DHCPv6 servers or AAA servers.
   Authorizing the use of a prefix that a central server has by a prefix
   user needs communication between different network entities.

   Prefix usage and per-MN prefixes are widely discussed in IETF 16NG,
   NEMO, and NETLMM Working Groups.  Corresponding solutions are also
   introduced.  But these solutions only solve a part of the problem.
   In 16NG, an Access Router allocates a mobile node's prefix using
   Router Advertisement message defined in [RFC4861].  There is no
   discussion about how the Access Router acquires prefixes from
   external entity.  NEMO deals with synchronization of Mobile Network
   prefixes between a Mobile Router and a Home Agent, while the method
   is agnostic to the way that a Home Agent gets prefixes from back end
   servers.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6 [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6], Proxy
   Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages are used to
   allocate prefixes from a Local Mobile Anchor to a mobile node, but
   how the Local Mobile Anchor gets prefixes from external server is
   left out of the scope.

   [RFC3633] defines Prefix Delegation options and procedures to provide
   a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  In [RFC3633], the
   requesting router (RR) as DHCP client requests the prefixes for the
   prefix users from the delegating router (DR) as DHCP server.  When RR
   and DR are not located on the same subnet RR needs to have a Relay
   agent as well as DHCP client in order to communicate with DHCP server
   in the network.

   Making use of AAA infrastructure for prefix management can solve the
   aforementioned problems in a uniform way.


2.  Terminology
   Prefix Authorization (PA):  The process by which a network access
      server (NAS) (as AAA client) obtains a prefix dynamically from AAA
      server.


3.  Problem Statement

   AAA servers managing IP addresses is a convention.  [RFC2865] defines
   attribute Framed-IP-Address for allocating IPv4 address for a host.




Sarikaya & Xia           Expires January 7, 2009                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      PS:Diameter Prefix Authorization           July 2008


   AAA servers statically configuring IPv6 prefixes is also a
   convention.  [RFC3162] introduces Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute for
   configuring IPv6 prefixes for a host.  This configuration is static
   because Framed-IPv6-Prefix carries a number of prefixes only.
   Lifetime values for each prefix can not be carried.

   Existing AAA (RADIUS and Diameter) mechanisms can't accomodate prefix
   authorization.  [RFC4818] designs Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute.
   The protocol defined in [RFC4818] is in fact used for the AAA server
   to authorize prefix(es) to NAS for use in the user's network.
   However in [RFC4818], the recommended usage scenario is that the AAA
   server configures the delegating server acting as NAS with the
   prefix(es) and then DHCP Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] can be used to
   delegate these prefixes to the requesting router.  Also Delegated-
   IPv6-Prefix carries a number of prefixes only.  Lifetime values for
   each prefix can not be carried.  The identities of the end users for
   which prefixes are authorized can not be carried.  AAA server is not
   given any information on the end users of the prefixes.  Also the NAS
   could be better configured at the requesting router instead of at the
   DHCP server.

   In a prefix authorization application, the NAS requests prefixes from
   the AAA server.  In the request, the users of prefixes MUST be
   identified.  AAA server replies with one or more prefixes.  When the
   lifetime of the prefix(es) expires, the NAS renews its request for
   the prefix(es).

   There are many potential uses of such a prefix authorization
   application which are presented in the next section.  The number of
   applications is growing due to the use of point-to-point link model
   in cellular networks.


4.  Application Scenarios

   Diameter/Radius prefix authorization application has the applications
   that are described in this section.

4.1.  Prefix Management in Access Routers

   [RFC4968] provides different IPv6 link models that are suitable for
   IEEE 802.16 based networks and provides analysis of various
   considerations for each link model and the applicability of each link
   model under different deployment scenarios.  As to IPv6 addressing,
   there are two models, shared link model and point-to-point link
   model.  In the former model, an IPv6 prefix is shared by multiple
   MNs.  While in the point-to-point link model, a prefix is only
   assigned to one interface of MN.  Different MNs can't share a prefix



Sarikaya & Xia           Expires January 7, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      PS:Diameter Prefix Authorization           July 2008


   and an interface can have multiple prefixes.  [RFC5121] specifies the
   addressing and operation of IPv6 over the IPv6 specific part of the
   packet convergence sub-layer of IEEE Std 802.16e [802.16e] and point-
   to-point link model is recommended.

   Also, 3GPP/3GPP2 have earlier adopted the point-to-point link model
   [RFC3314].

   A mobile node and an Access Router are connected via a point-to-point
   connection at the IPv6 layer.  Hence each mobile node can be
   considered to be on a separate subnet.  The prefixes for the mobile
   node are advertised through Router Advertisement messages [RFC4861].

   When an MN attaches an Access Router(AR), the AR requests one or more
   prefixes for the MN from an external server.  When the MN detaches
   the AR, the prefixes should be released.  When an operator wants to
   renumber its network, prefixes with different lifetime are advertised
   to the MN.

   Diameter/Radius prefix authorization application can be the mechanism
   to deal with how AR acquires and manages these prefixes.

4.2.  Prefix Management in Local Mobility Anchors

   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] enables mobility support to a host
   without requiring its participation in any mobility related
   signaling.  Currently, only point-to-point access link is supported
   which assumes that the mobile node and the Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) are the only two nodes on the access link.  Figure 1 shows a
   typical process for MN to request it's home network prefix(es).


          MN      MAG      LMA      Server
            |------>|        |        |      1. RtSol
            |       |------->|        |      2. PBU (HNP=0)
            |       |        |<------>|      3. Prefix Exchange
            |       |<-------|        |      4. PBA (HNPs)
            |<------|        |        |      5. RA(HNPs)


            Figure 1: Prefix Authorization in Proxy Mobile IPv6

   1.  An MN solicits a router advertisement (RtSol) for stateless
       address configuration.
   2.  The Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) sends Proxy Binding Update (PBU)
       message to Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) and with Home Network
       Prefix (HNP) to zero.

   3.  No details are provided in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] on how LMA
       manages prefixes.  This is one of the motivations to design a
       Diameter/Radius application for prefix authorization.
   4.  The LMA replies PBU with Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) and
       sets MN's prefixes to HNP field of PBA.
   5.  MAG advertises prefixes to MN with Router Advertisement (RA) for
       stateless address configuration.

4.3.  Prefix Management for Mobile Routers

   [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] specifies mechanism for a Mobile
   Router(MR) to synchronize its Mobile Network Prefixes with its Home
   Agents and obtain new ones dynamically.  Figure 2 shows the process
   that a Mobile Router requests prefixes from a Home Agent.


            MR       HA      Server
            |        |        |
            |------->|        |      1. BU
            |        |        |
            |        |<------>|      2. Prefix Exchange
            |        |        |
            |<-------|        |      3. BA
            |        |        |


                    Figure 2: Prefix Delegation in NEMO

   1.  Mobile Network Prefix request option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] is included in the Binding
       Update(BU) to indicate to the Home Agent(HA) that the MR wishes
       to get new prefixes assigned to it for use as Mobile Networks
       Prefixes.
   2.  The HA requests prefix from an external entity.  There is no
       further description in [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation].  The
       problem can also be solved by defining a new Diameter/Radius
       application.
   3.  Mobile Network Prefix Confirm option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] is included in the Binding
       Acknowledgement to allocate prefixes to the MR.

   Mobile Network Prefix Confirm option carries the prefix lifetime.
   Prefixes can be refreshed either by MR sending a BU or by HA sending
   a BA.

5.  Requirements on AAA-based Prefix Authorization Application

   AAA-based prefix authorization (PA) application MUST run between a
   NAS, located on AR, LMA, MR, etc. and an AAA server.

   AAA-based PA application MUST support the AAA client to request
   prefixes from an AAA server.  AAA-based PA application MUST support
   the client to give back the prefixes to the AAA server.

   If Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] is used by the devices
   on the network, the certificate or the information needed to obtain a
   certificate SHOULD also be sent by the AAA server to NAS.

   In point-to-point link operation, the NAS MUST identify the interface
   of MN in its request.  The NAS MAY provide a prefix hint, e.g. of
   length /48 to which the AAA server MUST reply with one or more
   prefixes, e.g. of length /64.

   In point-to-point operation, the AAA server MAY assign the prefix(es)
   and related parameters such as the lifetime and the certificates to
   MN from MN's profile.

   AAA-based prefix authorization application SHOULD support prefix
   release procedures.

   The NAS is responsible for renewing the prefixes when the lifetime
   expires.  The NAS SHOULD be able to extend the lifetime of the
   prefixes using messages designed for this purpose.

   It SHOULD be possible to renumber the prefixes authorized by AAA
   server.  The AAA server SHOULD initiate prefix renumbering process.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document is a problem statement that does not by itself
   introduce any security issues.


7.  IANA Considerations

   None.


8.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.
