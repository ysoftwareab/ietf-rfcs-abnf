                   draft-ietf-mile-iodef-guidance-06

Abstract

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format v2
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis] defines a data representation that
   provides a framework for sharing information commonly exchanged by
   Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer
   security incidents.  Since the IODEF model includes a wealth of
   available options that can be used to describe a security incident or
   issue, it can be challenging for security practicioners to develop
   tools that can leverage IODEF for incident sharing.  This document
   provides guidelines for IODEF practicioners.  It also addresses how
   common security indicators can be represented in IODEF and use-cases
   of how IODEF is being used so far.  The goal of this document is to
   make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier and encourage faster and
   wider adoption of the model by Computer Security Incident Response
   Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.

Internet-Draft               IODEF Guidance                    July 2016


1.  Introduction

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format v2 in
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis] defines a data representation that
   provides a framework for sharing information commonly exchanged by
   Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer
   security incidents.  The IODEF data model consists of multiple
   classes and data types that are defined in the IODEF XML schema.

   The IODEF schema was designed to be able to describe all the possible
   fields that would be needed in a security incident exchange.  Thus,
   IODEF contains plenty data constructs that could potentially make it
   harder for IODEF implementers to decide which are the most important
   ones to use.  Additionally, in the IODEF schema, there exist multiple
   fields and classes which do not necessarily need to be used in every
   possible data exchange.  Moreover, there are fields that are useful
   only in data exchanges of non-traditional security events.  This
   document tries to address these issues.  It also addresses how common
   security indicators can be represented in IODEF.  It points out the
   most important IODEF classes for an implementer and describe other
   ones that are not as important.  Also, it presents some common
   challenges for IODEF implementers and how to address them.  The end
   goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier
   and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by Computer
   Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.

   Section 3 discusses the recommended classes and how an IODEF
   implementer should chose the classes to implement.  Section 4
   presents common considerations a practicioner will come across and
   how to address them.  Section 5 goes over some common uses of IODEF.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in
   [RFC5070] and [RFC7203].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Implementation Strategy

   It is important for IODEF practicioners to be able to distinguish how
   the IODEF classes will be used in incident information exchanges.  It
   is critical to follow a strategy according to which of the various
   IODEF classes will be implemented.  It is also important to know the
   most common classes that will be used to describe common security
   incidents or indicators.  Thus, this section will describe the most

Internet-Draft               IODEF Guidance                    July 2016


   important classes and factors an IODEF implementer should take into
   consideration before designing the implementation or tool.

3.1.  Minimal IODEF document

   An IODEF document MUST include at least an Incident class and a
   version attribute.  An Incident MUST contain three minimal mandatory-
   to-implement classes.  An Incident class needs to have a Generation
   time and at least one Contact and IncidentID class.  The structure of
   the minimal-style Incident class follows below.

       +-------------------------+
       | Incident                |
       +-------------------------+
       | ENUM purpose            |<>----------[ IncidentID      ]
       |                         |<>----------[ GenerationTime  ]
       |                         |<>--{1..*}--[ Contact         ]
       +-------------------------+

                       Minimal-style Incident class

   This minimal Incident class needs to include a purpose attribute and
   the IncidentID, GenerationTime, and Contact elements.

   The Contact class requires the type and role attributes, but no
   elements are required by the IODEF v2 specification.  Nevertheless,
   at least one of the elements in the Contact class, such as Email
   class, need to be implemented so that the IODEF document can be
   practical.

   Implementers can refer to Appendix A and Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis] for example IODEF and IODEF v2 documents
   respectively.

3.2.  Decide what IODEF will be used for

   There is no need for an practicioner to implement IODEF classes and
   fields other than the minimal ones (Section 3.1) and the ones that
   are necessary for his use-cases.  The implementer SHOULD carefuly
   look into the schema and decide classes to implement (or not).

   For example, if we have has DDoS as a potential use-case, then the
   Flow class and its included information are the most important
   classes to use.  The Flow class describes information related to the
   attacker hosts and victim hosts, which information may help automated
   filtering or sink-hole operations.





Kampanakis & Suzuki      Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               IODEF Guidance                    July 2016


   Another potential use-case is malware command and control.  After
   modern malware infects a device, it usually proceeds to connect to
   one or more command and control (c2) servers to receive instructions
   from its master and potentially exfiltrate information.  To protect
   against such activity, it is important to interrupt the c2
   communication by filtering the activity.  IODEF can describe such
   activities using the Flow and the ServiceName classes.

   For use-cases where indicators need to be described more than events
   themselves, the IndicatorData class and the necessary included in it
   classes will be implemented instead of the EventData class and its
   classes.

   In summary, an implementer SHOULD identify the use-cases and find the
   classes that are necessary to support in IODEF v2.  Implementing and
   parsing all IODEF classes can be cumbersome in some occasions and is
   not always necessary.  Other external schemata can also be used in
   IODEF to describe incidents or indicators which should be treated
   accordingly only if the implementer's IODEF use-cases require
   external schema support.

3.3.  Indicators vs Events

   [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis] contains classes that can describe attack
   Methods, Events, Indicents, how they were discovered and the
   Assessment of the reprecussions of the incident to the victim.  It is
   important for implementers to know the distinction between these
   classes in order to decide which ones fullfulls their use-cases.

   An IndicatorData class depicts a threat indicator or observable that
   could be used to describe a threat that does not necessarily mean
   that an exploit happened.  For example, we could see an attack
   happening but it might have been prevented and not have resulted in
   an incident or security event.  On the other hand an EventData class
   usually describes a security event and can be considered as a
   incident report of something that took place.

   Classes like Discovery, Assessment, Method, RecoveryTime are used in
   conjuction with EventData as they related to the incident report
   described in the EventData.  The RelatedActivity class can reference
   an incident, an indicator or other related threat activity.

   While deciding what classes are important for the needed use-cases,
   IODEF users SHOULD carefuly evaluate the necessary classes and how
   these are used in order to avoid unecessary work.  For example, if we
   want to only describe indicators in IODEF, the implementation of
   Method or Assessment might not be important.

4.  IODEF considerations and how to address them

4.1.  External References

   The IODEF format includes the Reference class that refers to
   externaly defined information such as a vulnerability, Intrusion
   Detection System (IDS) alert, malware sample, advisory, or attack
   technique.  To facilitate the exchange of information, the Reference
   class was extended to the Enumeration Reference Format [RFC7495].
   The Enumeration Reference Format specifies a format to include
   enumeration values from external data representations into IODEF like
   CVE, and manages references to external representations using IANA
   registry.  Practicioners SHOULD only support external enumerations
   that are expected to be used in IODEF documents for their use-cases.

4.2.  Extensions

   The IODEF data model ([RFC5070]) is extensible.  Many class
   attributes and their values can be extended using using the "ext-*"
   prefix.  Additional classed can also be defined by using the
   AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.  An extension to the
   AdditionalData class for reporting Phishing emails is defined in
   [RFC5901].

   Additionally, IODEF can import existing schemata by using an
   extension framework defined in [RFC7203].  The framework enables
   IODEF users to embed XML data inside an IODEF document using external
   schemata or structures defined by external specifications.  Examples
   include CVE, CVRF and OVAL.  Thus, [RFC7203] enhances the IODEF
   capabilities without further extending the data model.

   IODEF practicioners can consider using their own IODEF extensions
   only for data that cannot be described using existing standards or
   importing them in and IODEF document using [RFC7203] is not a
   suitable option.

   Information about extending IODEF classes attributes and enumarated
   values can be found in Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis].

4.3.  Indicator predicate logic

   An IODEF [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis] document can describe incident
   reports and indicators.  The Indicator class can include references
   to other indicators, observables and more classes the contain details
   about the indicator.  When describing security indicators, it is
   often common to need to group them together in order to form a group
   of indicator that constitute a security threat.  For example, a
   botnet might have multiple command and control servers.  For that

Internet-Draft               IODEF Guidance                    July 2016


   reason, IODEF v2 introduced the IndicatorExpression class that is
   used to add the indicator predicate logic when grouping more than one
   indicators or observables.

   It is important for implementers to be able to parse and apply the
   boolean logic offered by an IndicatorExpression in order to evaluate
   the existance of an indicator.  As explained in Section 3.29.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis] the IndicatorExpression element operator
   defines the operator applied to all the child element of the
   IndicatorExpression.  If no operator is defined "and" SHOULD be
   assumed.  IndicatorExpressions can also be nested together.  Child
   IndicatorExpressions should be treated as child elements of their
   parent and they SHOULD be evaluated first before evaluated with the
   operator of their parent.

   In the following example the EventData class evaluates as a Flow of
   one System with source address being (10.10.10.104 OR 10.10.10.106)
   AND target address 10.1.1.1

      </Indicator>
    </IndicatorData>
   <!-- ...XML code omitted... -->

   Similarly, the FileData Class can be an observable in an
   IndicatorExpression.  The hash values of two files can be used to
   match against an indicator using boolean "or" logic.  In the
   following example the indicator consists of either of the two files
   with two different hashes.

4.4.  Disclosure level of IODEF

   The information conveyed in IODEF documents SHOULD be treated
   carefully since the content may be confidential.  IODEF provides a
   disclosure level indicator, but its enforcement depends on operations
   at the practicioner's side.

   IODEF has a common attribute, called "restriction", which indicates
   the disclosure guideline to which the sender expects the recipient to
   adhere to for the information represented in the class and its
   children.  That way, the sender can express the level of disclosure
   for each component of an IODEF document.  Appropriate external
   measures could be implemented based on the restriction level.  One
   example is when RID is used to transfer the IODEF documents, it can
   provide policy guidelines for handling IODEF documents by using the
   RIDPolicy class.

   The enforcement of the disclosure guidelines goes beyond IODEF.  The
   recipient of the IODEF document needs to follow the guidelines, but
   these guidelines themselves do not provide any enforcement measures.
   For that purpose, practicioners SHOULD consider appropriate measures,
   technical or operational.

5.  Current uses of IODEF

   IODEF is currently used by various organizations in order to
   represent security incidents and share incident and threat
   information between security operations organizations.

5.1.  Inter-vendor and Service Provider Exercise

   Various vendors organized and executed an exercise where multiple
   threat indicators were exchanged using IODEF.  The transport protocol
   used was RID.  The threat information shared included incidents like
   DDoS attacks.  Malware and Spear-Phishing.  As this was a proof-of-
   concept (PoC) exercise only example information (no real threats)
   were shared as part of the exchanges.

                           PoC peering topology

   The figure above shows how RID interactions took place during the
   PoC.  Participating organizations were running RID Agent software on-
   premises.  The RID Agents formed peering relationships with other
   participating organizations.  When Entity X had a new incident to
   exchange it would package it in IODEF and send it to Entity Y over
   TLS in a RID Report message.  In case there was an issue with the
   message, Entity Y would send an RID Acknowledgement message back to
   Entity X which included an application level message to describe the
   issue.  Interoperability between RID agents and the standards,
   [RFC6545] and [RFC6546], was also proven in this exercise.
   Appendix A includes some of the incident IODEF example information
   that was exchanged by the organizations' RID Agents as part of this
   proof-of-concept.

   The first use-case included sharing of Malware Data Related to an
   Incident between CSIRTs.  After Entity X detected an incident, she
   would put data about malware found during the incident in a backend
   system.  Entity X then decided to share the incident information with
   Entity Y about the malware discovered.  This could be a human
   decision or part of an automated process.

   Below are the steps followed for the malware information exchange
   that was taking place:

   (1)  Entity X has a sharing agreement with Entity Y, and has already
        been configured with the IP address of Entity Y's RID Agent

   (2)  Entity X's RID Agent connects to Entity Y's RID Agent, and
        mutual authentication occurs using PKI certificates.

   (3)  Entity X pushes out a RID Report message which contains
        information about N pieces of discovered malware.  IODEF is used
        in RID to discribe the

        (a)  Hash of malware files

        (b)  Registry settings changed by the malware

        (c)  C&C Information for the malware

   (4)  Entity Y receives RID Report message, sends RID Acknowledgement
        message

   (5)  Entity Y stores the data in a format that makes it possible for
        the back end to know which source the data came from.

   Another use-case was sharing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) as
   presented below information: Entity X, a Critical Infrastructure and
   Key Resource (CIKR) company detects that their internet connection is
   saturated with an abnormal amount of traffic.  Further investigation
   determines that this is an actual DDoS attack.  Entity X's computer
   incident response team (CIRT) contacts their ISP and shares
   information with them about the attack traffic characteristics.  In
   addition, Entity X has an information sharing relationship with
   Entity Y.  It shares information with Entity Y on characteristics of
   the attack to watch for.  Entitty X's ISP is being overwhelmed by the
   amount of traffic, so it shares attack signatures and IP addresses of
   the most prolific hosts with its adjacent ISPs.

   Below are the steps followed for a DDoS information exchange:

   (1)  Entity X has a sharing agreement with Entity Y, and has already
        been configured with the IP address of Entity Y's RID Agent

   (2)  Entity X's RID Agent connects to Entity Y's RID Agent, and
        mutual authentication occurs using PKI certificates.

   (3)  Entity X pushes out a RID Report message which contains
        information about the DDoS attack.  IODEF is used in RID to
        discribe the

        (e)  HTTP User-Agents used

   (4)  Entity Y receives RID Report message, sends RID Acknowledgement
        message

   (5)  Entity Y stores the data in a format that makes it possible for
        the back end to know which source the data came from.

   One more use-case was sharing spear-phishing email information as
   explained in the following scenario: The board members of several
   defense contractors receive an email inviting them to attend a
   conference in San Francisco.  The board members are asked to provide
   their personally identifiable information such as their home address,
   phone number, corporate email, etc in an attached document which came
   with the email.  The board members were also asked to click on a URL
   which would allow them to reach the sign up page for the conference.
   One of the recipients believes the email to be a phishing attempt and
   forwards the email to their corporate CSIRT for analysis.  The CSIRT
   identifies the email as an attempted spear phishing incident and
   distributes the indicators to their sharing partners.

   Below are the steps followed for a spear-phishing information
   exchange between CSIRTs that was part of this PoC.

   (1)  Entity X has a sharing agreement with Entity Y, and has already
        been configured with the IP address of Entity Y's RID Agent

   (2)  Entity X's RID Agent connects to Entity Y's RID Agent, and
        mutual authentication occurs using PKI certificates.

   (3)  Entity X pushes out a RID Report message which contains
        information about the spear-phishing email.  IODEF is used in
        RID to discribe the

        (a)  Attachment details (file Name, hash, size, malware family

        (b)  Target description (IP, domain, NSLookup)

        (c)  Email information (From, Subject, header information, date/
             time, digital signature)

        (d)  Confidence Score

   (4)  Entity Y receives RID Report message, sends RID Acknowledgement
        message

   (5)  Entity Y stores the data in a format that makes it possible for
        the back end to know which source the data came from.

5.2.  Implementations

   In order to use IODEF, some tools that cope with IODEF documents,
   such as the IODEF parser, are needed.  Though arbitrary
   implementations can be done, some guidelines are provided in
   [I-D.ietf-mile-implementreport].  IODEF , but
   [I-D.ietf-mile-implementreport] provides guidelines for implementers.
   The document does not specify any specific MTI but provides a list of
   implementations the authors have surveyed at the time of its
   publication as well as some tips on the implementations.
   Implementers are encourage to read the draft.

5.3.  Other

   IODEF is also used in various projects and products to consume and
   share security information.  Various vendor incident reporting
   products have the ability to consume and export in IODEF format
   [implementations].  Perl and Python modules (XML::IODEF, Iodef::Pb,
   iodeflib) exist in order to parse IODEF documents and their
   extensions.  Additionally, some worldwide CERT organizations are
   already able to use receive incident information in IODEF.

   Future use-cases of IODEF could be:

   (1)  ISP notifying a national CERT or organization when it identifies
        and acts upon an incident and CERTs notifying ISPs when they are
        aware of incidents.

   (2)  Suspected phishing emails could be shared amongst organizations
        and national agencies.  Automation could validate web content
        that the suspicious emails are pointing to.  Identified
        malicious content linked in a phishing email could then be
        shared using IODEF.  Phishing campaigns could thus be subverted
        much faster by automating information sharing using IODEF.

   (3)  When finding a certificate that should be revoked, a thrid-party
        would forward an automated IODEF message to the CA with the full
        context of the certificate and the CA could act accordingly
        after checking its validity.  Alternatively, in the event of a
        compromise of the private key of a certificate, a third-party
        could alert the certificate owner about the compromise using
        IODEF.
