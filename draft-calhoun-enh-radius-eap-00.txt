Abstract
     
   The RADIUS Protocol allows for authentication using existing 
   PPP authentication protocols such as PAP and CHAP.  This 
   document describes how the Enhanced RADIUS Protocol could 
   also include the PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol, EAP.

   1. Introduction
     
   The PPP extensions WG is considering a new authentication protocol 
   for PPP called EAP - PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol.  EAP is 
   described in [2].
     
   EAP is intended to provide support for authentication protocols which 
   do not fit into the PAP or CHAP model using a standard mechanism.  The 
   protocols include varieties of smart cards, S/key, Public Key and 
   Kerberos.  EAP is designed to allow a RADIUS style helper to handle 
   all authentication protocol support where the NAS acts as a transit 
   mechanism for EAP packets.
     
   The following diagram gives an example of how an EAP authentication 
   using S/key might be accomplished with Enhanced RADIUS.  This example 
   may be extended to other EAP protocols easily, but this concrete 
   example serves to make it a easier to understand the basic concept:

   The following describes one way to make this work with RADIUS:  

   a) Upon receiving an EAP-Response as the authentication protocol, 
      the NAS sends a RADIUS-EAP-Request to the RADIUS-server.  The 
      absence of an EAP-Packet attribute in this request indicates that 
      this is a Start-EAP indication. 
     
   b) The RADIUS-server responds by sending a RADIUS-EAP-ACK with an 
      EAP-Packet attribute specifying the EAP packet to be issued to the 
      NAS.  The EAP type of this packet will normally be "Identity", but 
      it could be any other valid EAP type if the server does not need to 
      know the user identity before beginning authentication.  The NAS 
      forwards the EAP packet on to the PPP client.
     
   c) The PPP client responds by sending an EAP-Response packet, which 
      the NAS forwards to the RADIUS-server in the EAP-Packet attribute 
      of a RADIUS-EAP-Request. 
     
   d) Based on the user's identity, the RADIUS-server determines if it
      is able to authenticate the user locally, otherwise it may proxy 
      the request to a remote RADIUS server.

   e) The RADIUS-server decides whether the response is okay and sends
      a RADIUS-EAP-Ack or RADIUS-EAP-Reject with the appropriate EAP 
      success/failure packet inside an EAP-MSG attribute.  The NAS 
      forwards the EAP packet to the PPP client, and accepts or rejects 
      the connection.
     
     
   The above scenario creates a situation in which the NAS never needs to 
   touch an EAP packet.  An alternative which may be used by NAS vendors 
   wanting to simplify things would be for the NAS to, 1) always send an
   EAP Identity request message to the client, and 2) to forward the 
   response to the RADIUS-server in the EAP-Packet attribute of a 
   RADIUS-EAP-Request.
   
   Unless the NAS interprets the EAP-Packet field of
   RADIUS-EAP-Requests, it will not see the user id supplied by the
   client.  Rather than doing this interpretation, it is suggested that a
   simple mechanism be defined for the RADIUS server to set the userid in
   the NAS with a special attribute.  It is important to have a userid 
   for logging and accounting purposes.

   In the case where the RADIUS Server does not support the EAP 
   Extension, the following scenario would occur:

   3. Command Meanings
     
   3.1 RADIUS-EAP-Request
     
    Description
     
      RADIUS-EAP-Request packets are sent by the Radius Client to the 
      Radius Server, and convey EAP-Responses from the client through the
      NAS and on to the Radius server.  RADIUS-EAP-Requests will normally
      include a single EAP-Packet attribute which contains the EAP packet.
      A RADIUS-EAP-Request sent from the NAS to the RADIUS server that 
      does not contain an EAP-Packet attribute signals to the RADIUS 
      server that it is to initiate EAP authentication with the client.

      Upon receipt of a RADIUS-EAP-Request, A RADIUS Server MUST 
      issue a reply. The reply may be either: 1) a RADIUS-EAP-Response 
      containing an EAP-Request in a single EAP-Packet attribute, 2) a 
      RADIUS-EAP-Ack containing an EAP-Packet of type "success", or 3) a 
      RADIUS-EAP-Reject containing an EAP-Packet of type "failure". A 
      Command-Unrecognized packet is returned if the server does not 
      support EAP.

      A summary of the RADIUS-EAP-Request packet format is shown 
      below. The fields are transmitted from left to right.

    Length

      The total length of the message, including this header.

    Authenticator

      The Authenticator field is a random 16 octet value. If the 
      Timestamp option is supported, the first four octets contain a 
      timestamp of when the packet was sent from the peer. 

    Message Integrity Code

      This field contains an MD5 hash of the following:

         MD5( packet | Shared Secret )

    Attributes
     
      The Attribute field is variable in length, and contains a list of 
      zero or more Attributes.  It MAY contain zero or one EAP-Packet 
      attributes.  If it does not contain an EAP-Packet attribute, it is
      an indication to the server that server that EAP should be 
      initiated by the server.  If it contains one EAP-Packet attribute, 
      this attribute contains the reply to the last EAP-Request issued by
      the server (or the reply to the EAP-Identity that can be issued by 
      the NAS). The remainder of the attributes are those normally sent 
      on an Access-Request by the NAS.
     
     
   3.2 RADIUS-EAP-Response
     
    Description

      RADIUS-EAP-Response packets are sent by the RADIUS-Server to the 
      NAS. They contain the next EAP-Request packet to be passed to the 
      client.

      The RADIUS-EAP-Response MUST contain a single EAP-Packet 
      attribute.

      After issuing the included EAP-Request to the client, the NAS 
      remains in a state where it awaits further EAP-Responses from the 
      client.

    Authenticator

      The Authenticator field is a random 16 octet value. If the 
      Timestamp option is supported, the first four octets contain a 
      timestamp of when the packet was sent from the peer. 

    Message Integrity Code

      This field contains an MD5 hash of the following:

         MD5( packet | Shared Secret )

    Attributes
     
      The Attribute field contains only a single EAP-Packet attribute 
      which contains an EAP-Request packet.


   3.4 RADIUS-EAP-Reject
     
    Description
     
      RADIUS-EAP-Reject packets are sent by the RADIUS server to the NAS. 
      They are sent in response to a RADIUS-EAP-Request that results in 
      an authentication failure.  RADIUS-EAP-Reject packets contain a 
      single EAP-Packet attribute containing an EAP failure packet.
   
      After issuing the included EAP failure packet to the client, the
      NAS should end the authentication phase with a negative result.

      A summary of the RADIUS-EAP-Reject packet format is shown below. 
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   6. Motivation

      The motivation for this extension to Enhanced RADIUS is to allow
      RADIUS, which is the most common Authentication protocol deployed 
      today, to keep up with the new authentication protocols currently 
      being worked on by the PPP Extensions WG.

      This extension allows the NAS' to support a variety of 
      authentication protocols by delegating the task to the 
      Authentication server. The NAS needs to simply forward packets from 
      the PPP client to the local RADIUS Server. Note, however, that the 
      same RADIUS Server must be used throughout the whole transaction 
      process (see section 7 on dealing with proxy'ed requests). If the 
      local RADIUS server becomes unavailable at any time during the 
      authentication phase, the NAS will have to begin LCP negotiations 
      again with the PPP client.

      Since the EAP messages are simply forwarded from/to the NAS and the
      RADIUS Server, the support of the Message Integrity Check in the 
      Enhanced RADIUS header allows both parties to authenticate 
      themselves.





Rubens                                                          [Page 14] 
DRAFT        Extensible Authentication Protocol Support        June 1996
     
   7. Description (or Implementation Rules)
     
      Upon negotiating LCP EAP with the PPP client, the NAS must send a 
      EAP Start message to the local RADIUS Server (note this should only 
      be done if the NAS is aware that its local RADIUS Server is capable
      of the Enhanced RADIUS protocol [1]). The EAP-Start message is an 
      EAP-Request with no EAP-Packet attribute present.

      If the RADIUS Server does not support this extension, a 
      Command-Unrecognized message will be returned to the NAS. Upon 
      receipt of this packet, the NAS will NAK the PPP client and request
      PAP or CHAP as the authentication protocol.

      For Proxied RADIUS requests there are two methods of processing,
      if the domain is determined based on the DNIS the RADIUS-server may
      proxy the initial EAP-Start request. In the case that the domain is
      determined based on the user id, the local RADIUS-server must 
      issue the EAP-identity request. The response from the PPP user
      must be proxied to the final authentication server.

      If the RADIUS Server does support this extension, an EAP-Identity
      message is returned to the NAS. Upon receipt of this packet, the 
      NAS will complete the LCP negotiation phase and will enter the EAP
      authentication phase. The NAS will then forward the packet which
      was contained in the EAP-Packet attribute of the EAP-Request-Ack to 
      the PPP client.

      For proxied RADIUS requests, a Command-Unrecognized message may be
      received following the EAP-Identity response. This would occur 
      if the messages was proxied to a RADIUS-server which does not 
      support the EAP extension.

      Note that if at any point an EAP-Request-Reject message is received 
      from the RADIUS Server, the NAS SHOULD issue an LCP Terminate 
      Request to the PPP Client. 

      At this point, the PPP Client will exchange a series of 
      request/response messages with the RADIUS Server. This is done 
      until either an EAP-Request-Reject is received (which will 
      disconnect the user), or an EAP-Request-Success is received which 
      the NAS would then successfully end the authentication phase.

      The RADIUS-server will always include the CLASS attribute in all
      messages to the NAS. The NAS MUST include this same attribute in 
      the subsequent message to the RADIUS-server which includes the
      response from the PPP client. The CLASS attribute which is

DRAFT        Extensible Authentication Protocol Support        June 1996
     
      associated with the EAP-Request-Success message from the 
      RADIUS-server is the one which should be used by the NAS in 
      all accounting messages for the authenticated user.

      The RADIUS-EAP-Ack issued by the server to the NAS will contain all 
      of the attributes which are contained in an Access-Accept in 
      addition to the EAP-Packet attribute.

      The Port number and NAS Identifier are included in the attributes
      issued by the NAS in the original RADIUS-EAP-Request message.

      The NAS is not responsible for the retransmission of any EAP 
      messages. The PPP client and the RADIUS-server are responsible for
      for any retransmissions.
