1. Introduction

   Many applications e.g., Intrusion detection, traffic engineering, and
   accounting among others require the monitoring, measuring of IP
   traffic flows. It is hence important to have a standard way of
   exporting information related to IP       flows. This document
   defines the base set of data items which may be used by the exporter
   for IP traffic flow monitoring and measuring. It also defines the
   mechanism by which new data items may be added without changing the
   underlying exchange protocol.

2. Scope

   This document defines information data model for IPFIX-Requirements
   [1]Specifically, this document describes a general purpose flow
   definition along with the data elements which may be exported.

3. Definition of a Flow

   As defined in the requirement draft IPFIX-Requirements [1]

   . A flow is a set of packets passing an observation point in the
   network during a certain time interval. All packets belonging to a
   particular flow have a set of common properties derived from the data
   contained in the packet and from the packet treatment at the
   observation point.

   In this document we define the flow more specifically. A flow is
   defined as a set of packets passing an observation point in the
   network during a certain time interval. All packets belonging to a
   particular flow have a set of common properties.

   Each property is defined as the result of applying a function to the
   values of: A. one or more of packet header fields (e.g. destination
   IP address) B. one or more properties of the packet itself (e.g.
   packet length) C. one or more of fields derived from packet treatment
   (e.g. AS number) A packet is defined to belong to a flow if it
   matches all the defined properties of the flow. Flows can be defined
   in multiple ways.

4. Properties of an IPFIX Information Element

   Information elements defined in this specification, or by extension
   MUST have the following properties defined:

      Name - a unique and meaningful name for the field. The preferred
      spelling for the name is to use mixed case if the name is
      compound, with an initial lower case letter. (E.g.
      "sourceAddress").

      Description - the semantics of this information element. Describes
      how this field is derived from the flow or other information
      available to the observer.

      Type - the typespace for attributes is constrained to facilitate
      implementation. The existing typespace does however encompass most
      basic types used in modern programming languages, as well as some
      derived types (such as IPAddress) which are common to this domain
      and useful to distinguish.

      FieldId - a numeric identifier administered by IANA. This is used
      for compact identification of an information item when encoding
      templates in the protocol.

   Information elements defined in this specification, or by extension
   MAY have the following properties defined:

      Vendor ID - when extension is done outside of the scope of the
      IANA IPFIX fieldId range, a vendorId MUST be provided.  This
      identifier is based on IANA assigned enterprise identifiers.

      Reference - identifies additional specifications which more
      precisely define this item or provide additional context for its
      use.

      Units - if the field is a measure of some kind, the units identify
      what the measure is.

      Enumerated range - some items may have a specific set of numeric
      identifiers associated with a set of discrete values this element
      may take.  The meaning of each discrete value and a human readable
      name should be assigned.

      Range - some elements may only be able to take on a restricted set
      of values which can be expressed as a range (e.g. 0 through 511
      inclusive). If this is the case, the valid inclusive range should
      be specified.

5. Type Space

   The following subsections describe the basic types from which most
   IPFIX information elements should be constructed.

   By describing Information Elements in terms of a well defined type
   space, versus describing these details in each Element declaration,
   greater consistency of the existing Information Model is expected.
   This should also simplify the process of extending the Information
   Model over time, and maintain this consistency.

5.1 int

   The type "int" represents a integer numeric value in the range of
   -2147483648 to 2147483647. (i.e. a 32-bit integer)

5.2 unsignedInt

   The type "unsignedInt" represents an integer value in the range of 0
   to 4294967295. (i.e. a 32-bit unsigned integer)

5.3 long

   The type "long" represents an integer value in the range of
   9223372036854775807 to -9223372036854775808. (i.e. a 64-bit integer)

5.4 unsignedLong

   The type "unsignedLong" represents an integer value in the range of 0
   to 18446744073709551615. (i.e. a 64-bit unsigned integer)

5.5 float

   The type "float" corresponds to an IEEE single-precision 32-bit
   floating point type.

5.6 double

   The double datatype corresponds to IEEE double-precision 64-bit
   floating point type

5.7 hexBinary

   The type "hexBinary" represents a finite length string of octets.
   Note the name reflects the mechanism used in XML documents to
   represent the value using ASCII characters.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Information Model                June 2003


5.8 string

   The type "string" represents a finite length string of valid
   characters from the Unicode character encoding set. Unicode allows
   for ASCII and many other international character sets to be used. It
   is expected that strings will be encoded in UTF-8 format, which is
   identical in encoding for USASCII characters, but also accomodates
   other Unicode multibyte characters.

5.9 boolean

   The type "boolean" represents the values for binary logic. (i.e.
   "true/false" or "1/0").

5.10 byte

   The type "byte" represents a integer numeric value in the range of
   -128 to 127. (i.e. an 8-bit integer)

5.11 unsignedByte

   The type "unsignedByte" represents a non-negative integer numeric
   value in the range of 0 to 255. (i.e. an 8-bit unsigned integer)

5.12 short

   The type "short" represents a integer numeric value in the range of
   32767 to 32768. (i.e. an 16-bit integer)

5.13 unsignedShort

   The type "unsignedShort" represents a non-negative integer numeric
   value in the range of 0 to 65535. (i.e. an 16-bit unsigned integer)

5.14 dateTime

   The "dateTime" type represents a specific instant of time. It is
   further restricted from the basic XML dateTime type to having a
   precision of seconds and normalized to the GMT timezone. Such types
   are in common use on many Operating Systems and have the advantage
   that they can be stored in 32-bit integers.

5.15 ipdr:dateTimeMsec

   The "dateTimeMsec" type is defined in the IPDR namespace. It
   represents a specific instant of time. It is further restricted from
   the basic XML dateTime type to having a precision of milliseconds and
   normalized to the GMT timezone.

   Such types are in common use on many Operating Systems and have the
   advantage that they can be stored in 64-bit integers.

5.16 ipdr:ipV4Addr

   The "ipV4Addr" type indicates the value is an IP version 4 address.
   These addresses are typically stored as 32-bit integers on systems.

5.17 ipdr:ipV6Addr

   The "ipV6Addr" type indicates the value is an IP version 6 address.
   IPv6 addresses are 16 byte octet strings.

5.18 ipdr:UUID

   The "UUID" type represents a universal unique id as defined in the
   OSF specification for Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). It's
   definition can be found in the OSF CAE Specification, Document C706,
   1997, Appendix A, located at: http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/
   009629399/

   UUIDs are equivalent to Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) used by
   Microsoft.

   UUIDs are 16 byte quantities which are generated in such a way that
   systems can independently generate their values, but still have a
   guarantee of global uniqueness of the generated value.

   UUID's are typically written in the form
   f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6. Which merely shows in
   hexadecimal the 16 byte value. Separators are introduced to segment
   the hex value into groupings of 4, 2, 2, 2 and 6 bytes.

   An open source C implementation of UUID generation is available in
   the appendix of the IETF draft, draftleach-uuids-guids-01.txt. This
   draft has expired, but an archived copy is available at: http://
   www.ipdr.org/public/draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt

   Note: the IETF draft was allowed to expire because the group
   considered the OSF work a referenceable standard and did not chose to
   duplicate it.

5.19 ipdr:dateTimeUsec

   The dateTimeUsec type is defined in the IPDR namespace. It represents
   a specific instant of time. It is further restricted from the basic
   XML dateTime type to having a precision of microseconds and
   normalized to the GMT timezone.

6. Extending the Information Model

   A key requirement for IPFIX is to allow for extending the set of
   information items which are reported for flows. This section defines
   the mechanism for extending this set.

   The IPFIX protocol carries flow records defined by a template.
   Multiple templates may be defined for a dialog between an exporter
   and a collector. A given template identifies the information items
   and their order. The means of identification of information items in
   a template is via a field ID. Field Id's are unique identifiers
   administered by IANA (ed. ? true for vendor specific fields?).

   Extension is done by defining new Information elements, including the
   set of necessary information and possibly additional optional
   information for each element. Each new information item MUST be
   assigned a unique fieldId as part of its definition. These unique
   flow ids are the connection between the record structure communicated
   by the protocol using templates and a consuming application.

7. The Benefits of a Formal Machine Readable Information Model

   Appendix A. expresses the IPFIX Information model as an XML-Schema.
   Using a formal and machine readable syntax for the Information model
   enables the creation of IPFIX aware tools which can automatically
   adapt to extensions to the information model, by simply reading
   updated information model specifications.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Information Model                June 2003


8. Using XML Schema for Information Models

   The use of XML-Schema as the formal specification language is modeled
   after the techniques employed by the IPDR NDM-U specification.

   The wide availability of XML aware tools is a primary consideration
   for this choice.  In particular libraries for parsing XML documents
   are readily available. Also mechanisms such as the Extensible
   Stylesheet Language (XSL) allow for transforming a source XML
   document into other documents.  This draft was initially authored in
   XML and transformed according to RFC2629.

   It should be noted that the use of XML processors is not mandatory
   for the deployment of IPFIX.  In particular exporting processes which
   may run on constrained platforms do not produce or consume XML as
   part of their operation.  It is expected that IPFIX collectors MAY
   take advantage of the machine readability of the Information Model
   vs. hardcoding their behavior or inventing proprietary means for
   accomodating extensions.

   Flows coming from SW1 and SW2 through proxy P1 would look to the
   Collector [ is this the right term??? PAC]  like the same Exporter
   connection. With the Source Exporter in the message the original
   Exporter  address is maintained.

Appendix A. IPFIX IPDR Service Definition

   This proposal does not currently address possible IANA implications
   associated with XML Namespace URIs. The use of Namespaces as an
   extension mechanism implies that an IANA registered Namespace URI
   should be available and that directory names below this base URI be
   assigned for relevant IETF specifications. The author is not aware of
   this mechanism today. Alternatively IPDR.org could fulfill this role.
   The sample uses the IPDR.org namespace.

      In the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) [RFC791] there is a field,
      called "Protocol", to identify the next level protocol.  This is an 8
      bit field.  In Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) [RFC1883] this field
      is called the "Next Header" field.
      </t><t>
      These numbers are administered by IANA.

      Source Exporter address is the address of the Exporter reporting
      the flow, Address is same as is as shown for Source Address. This
      information is used by applications to later correlate the
      ingress/egress port with a specific Exporter. It is also used to
      maintain the source Exporter information when there is an
      intermediate proxy. For example, given the picture below:
     </t><t><figure><artwork xml:space="preserve">

                  SW1 --------    P1 ------ Collector
                                  ^

      Flows coming from SW1 and SW2 through proxy P1 would look to the

      connection. With the Source Exporter in the message the original
      Exporter  address is maintained.
