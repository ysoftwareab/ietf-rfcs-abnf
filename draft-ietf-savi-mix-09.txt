           SAVI for Mixed Address Assignment Methods Scenario
                         draft-ietf-savi-mix-09

Abstract

   In case that multiple IP address assignment methods are allowed in a
   network, the corresponding SAVI methods should be enabled to prevent
   spoofing in the network.  This document reviews how multiple SAVI
   methods can coexist in a single SAVI device and collisions are
   resolved when the same binding entry is discovered by two or more
   methods.

1.  Introduction

   There are currently several SAVI documents ([RFC6620], [RFC7513] and
   [RFC7219]) that describe the different methods by which a switch can
   discover and record bindings between a node's IP address and a
   binding anchor and use that binding to perform source address
   validation.  Each of these documents specifies how to learn on-link
   addresses, based on the method used for their assignment,
   respectively: StateLess Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), Dynamic Host
   Control Protocol (DHCP) and Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND).  Each
   of these documents describes separately how one particular method
   deals with address collisions (same address, different binding
   anchor).

   While multiple IP assignment methods can be used in the same layer-2
   domain, a SAVI device might have to deal with a mix of SAVI methods.
   The purpose of this document is to provide recommendations to avoid
   collisions and to review collisions handling when two or more such
   methods come up with competing bindings.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Scope

   Three different IP address assignment methods have been analyzed for
   SAVI:

   1.  StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) - analyzed in SAVI-
       FCFS[RFC6620]

   2.  Dynamic Host Control Protocol address assignment (DHCP) -
       analyzed in SAVI-DHCP[RFC7513]

   3.  Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) address assignment, analyzed in
       SAVI-SEND[RFC7219]

   In addition, there is a fourth method for managing (i.e., creation,
   management, deletion) a binding on the switch, referred to as
   "manual".  It is based on manual binding configuration and is
   analyzed in [RFC6620] and [RFC7039].

   All combinations of address assignment methods can coexist within a
   layer-2 domain.  A SAVI device MUST implement the corresponding
   binding setup methods (referred to as a "SAVI method") to enable
   Source Address Validation.  If more than one SAVI method is enabled
   on a SAVI device, the method is referred to as "mix address
   assignment method" in this document.

   SAVI methods are independent from each other, each one handling its
   own entries.  In the absence of reconciliation, each method will
   reject packets sourced with an address it did not discovered.  To
   prevent addresses discovered by one method to be filtered out by
   another, the binding table should be shared by all the solutions.
   However this could create some conflict when the same entry is
   discovered by two different methods.  The purpose of this document is
   of two folds: provide recommendations and methods to avoid conflicts,
   and resolve conflicts if and when they happen.  Collisions happening
   within a given method are outside the scope of this document.

4.  Architecture

   A SAVI device may enable multiple SAVI methods.  This mechanism,
   called SAVI-MIX, is proposed as a arbiter of the binding generation
   algorithms, generating the final binding entries as illustrated in



Bi, et al.              Expires January 20, 2016                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  SAVI MIX                       July 2015


   Figure 1.  Once a SAVI method generates a candidate binding, it will
   request SAVI-MIX to set up a corresponding entry in the binding
   table.  Then SAVI-MIX will check if there is any conflict in the
   binding table.  A new binding will be generated if there is no
   conflict.  If there is a conflict, SAVI-MIX will determine whether to
   replace the existing binding or reject the candidate binding based on
   the policies specified in Section 6.

   The packet filtering will not be performed by each SAVI method
   separately.  Instead, SAVI-MIX will perform filtering based on the
   entries in the binding table.

   Each entry in the binding table will contain the following fields:

   1.  IP source address

Internet-Draft                  SAVI MIX                       July 2015


   2.  Binding anchor

   3.  Lifetime

   4.  Creation time

   5.  Binding methods: the methods which request the binding setup.

5.  Recommendations for preventing collisions

   If each solution has a dedicated address space, collisions won't
   happen.  Using non overlapping address space across SAVI solutions is
   therefore recommended.  To that end, one should:

   1.  DHCP/SLAAC: use non-overlapping prefix for DHCP and SLAAC.  Set
       the A bit in Prefix information option of Router Advertisement
       for SLAAC prefix, and set the M bit in Router Advertisement for
       DHCP prefix.  For detail explanations on these bits, refer to
       [RFC4861][RFC4862].

   2.  SeND/non-SeND: avoid mixed environment (where SeND and non-SeND
       nodes are deployed) or separate the prefixes announced to SeND
       and non-SenD nodes.  One way to separate the prefixes is to have
       the router(s) announcing different (non-overlapping) prefixes to
       SeND and to non-SeND nodes, using unicast Router
       Advertisements[RFC6085], in response to SeND/non-SeND Router
       Solicit.

6.  Resolving binding collisions

   In situations where collisions could not be avoided, two cases should
   be considered:

   1.  The same address is bound on two different binding anchors by
       different SAVI methods.

   2.  The same address is bound on the same binding anchor by different
       SAVI methods.

6.1.  Same Address on Different Binding Anchors

   This would typically occur in case assignment address spaces could
   not be separated.  For instance, an address is assigned by SLAAC on
   node X, installed in the binding table using SAVI-FCFS, anchored to
   "anchor-X".  Later, the same address is assigned by DHCP to node Y,
   and SAVI-DHCP will generate a candidate binding entry, anchored to
   "anchor-Y".

Internet-Draft                  SAVI MIX                       July 2015


6.1.1.  Basic preference

   The SAVI device must decide whom the address should be bound with
   (anchor-X or anchor-Y in this example).  Current standard documents
   of address assignment methods have implied the prioritization
   relationship, i.e., first-come.

   1.  SLAAC: s5.4.5 of [RFC4862]

   2.  DHCPv4: s3.1-p5 of [RFC2131]

   3.  DHCPv6: s18.1.8 of [RFC3315]

   4.  SeND: s8 of [RFC3971]

   In the absence of any configuration or protocol hint (see
   Section 6.1.2) the SAVI device should choose the first-come binding
   anchor, whether it was learnt from SLAAC, SeND or DHCP.

6.1.2.  Overwritten preference

   There are two identified exceptions to the general prioritization
   model, one of them being CGA addresses, another one controlled by the
   configuration of the switch.

6.1.2.1.  CGA preference

   When CGA addresses are used, and a collision is detected, preference
   should be given to the anchor that carries the CGA credentials once
   they are verified, in particular the CGA parameters and the RSA
   options.  Note that if an attacker was trying to replay CGA
   credentials, he would then compete on the base of "First-Come, First-
   Served" (FCFS) principle.

6.1.2.2.  configuration preference

   For configuration driven exceptions, the SAVI device may allow the
   configuration of a triplet ("prefix", "anchor", "method") or
   ("address", "anchor", "method"), where at least one of ("anchor",
   "method") should be specified.  Later, if a DAD message is received
   with the following conditions verified:

   1.  The target in the DAD message does not exist in the binding table

   2.  The target is within configured "prefix" (or equal to "address")

   3.  The anchor bound to target is different from the configured
       anchor, when specified



Bi, et al.              Expires January 20, 2016                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  SAVI MIX                       July 2015


   4.  The configured method, if any, is different from SAVI-FCFS

   the switch should defend the address by responding to the DAD
   message, with a NA message or an ARP response, on behalf of the
   target node.  Plain NA will be replied to SeND DAD.  SeND accepts
   plain NA for the first time (see s8 of [RFC3971]).  The probability
   for a SeND node to generate a colliding address more than one time is
   trivial in practice, thus the response can effectively protect an
   existing binding.

   It should not at this point install the entry into the binding table.
   It will simply prevent the node to assign the address, and will de-
   facto prioritize the configured anchor.  This is especially useful to
   protect well known bindings such as a static address of a server over
   anybody, even when the server is down.  It is also a way to give
   priority to a binding learnt from SAVI-DHCP over a binding for the
   same address, learnt from SAVI-FCFS.

6.1.3.  Multiple SAVI Device Scenario

   A single SAVI device doesn't have the information of all bound
   addresses on the perimeter.  Therefore it is not enough to lookup
   local bindings to identify a collision.  However, assuming DAD is
   performed throughout the security perimeter for all addresses
   regardless of the assignment method, then DAD response will inform
   all SAVI devices about any collision.  In that case, FCFS will apply
   the same way as in a single switch scenario.  If the admin configured
   on one the switches a prefix (or a single static binding) to defend,
   the DAD response generated by this switch will also prevent the
   binding to be installed on other switches of the perimeter.

6.2.  Same Address on the Same Binding Anchor

   A binding may be set up on the same binding anchor by multiple
   methods, typically SAVI-FCFS and SAVI-DHCP.  If the binding lifetimes
   obtained from the two methods are different, priority should be given
   to 1) Manual configuration 2) SAVI-DHCP 3) SAVI-FCFS as the least
   authoritative.  The binding will be removed when the prioritized
   lifetime expires, even if a less authoritative method had a longer
   lifetime.

7.  Security Considerations

   SAVI MIX does not eliminate the security problems of each SAVI
   method.  Thus, the potential attacks, e.g., the DoS attack against
   the SAVI device resource, can still happen.  In deployment, the
   security threats from each enabled SAVI methods should be prevented
   by the corresponding proposed solutions in each document.

Internet-Draft                  SAVI MIX                       July 2015


   SAVI MIX is only a binding setup/removal arbitration mechanism.  It
   does not introduce additional security threats only if the principle
   of decision is reasonable.  However, there is a slight problem.  SAVI
   MIX is more tolerant about binding establish than each SAVI method
   alone.  As long as one of the enabled SAVI method generates a
   binding, the binding will be applied.  As a result, the allowed
   binding number limitation or allowed binding setup rate limitation
   will be the sum of all the enabled SAVI methods.  In deployment,
   whether a SAVI device is capable to support that resource requirement
   should be evaluated.
