                  Minimal EDNS compliance requirements
                    draft-spacek-edns-camel-diet-01

Abstract

   DNS responders must either follow RFC 6891 by fully implementing EDNS
   or at least respond to queries containing OPT record according to
   older specifications.  Non-compliant implementations which do not
   respond at all are not worth talking to.

1.  Introduction

   Neither the original DNS standard RFC 1035 nor its extensions RFC
   2671 and RFC 6891 allow not to respond to a DNS query.  Many years
   later non-compliant implementations which drop queries still exist
   and cause lot of extra queries, latency, and complicated logic in
   recursive resolvers.  The cost of supporting these non-compliant
   implementations keeps increasing.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  The Protocol

   No DNS response message to a repeated DNS query containing EDNS
   extension implies that the other side is not a DNS responder.  The
   querier MUST NOT retry its query without EDNS.

3.  Security Considerations

   Instruction to follow EDNS standard does not change security
   properties beyond what is written in RFC 6891.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   This has no effect on privacy of DNS.
