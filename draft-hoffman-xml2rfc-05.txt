                   The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary
                        draft-hoffman-xml2rfc-05

Abstract

   This document defines the 'XML2RFC' version 3 vocabulary; an XML-
   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is
   heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under
   discussion.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ('v3') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version ("v2") vocabulary [XML2RFCv2],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [XML2RFCv2] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible. [[anchor2: More needs
   to be said here about what "obsoletes" means in this case.]]

   The v3 format will be used as part of the new RFC series described in
   [RFC6949].  The new series will have multiple formats: the canonical
   document will be in XML using the v3 format described here, and many
   non-canonical formats (such as HTML and text) will be generated as
   well.  The generation of these non-canonical formats means that there
   will be much more emphasis put on the processor that handles the XML.
   Features of the expected processor are described in Appendix B.

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   affect the rendering of the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

   The following is a hopefully-complete list of all the technical
   changes between [XML2RFCv2] and this document, as welll as the design
   criteria for those changes.  Note that the list is for the current
   version of this document only.  There are additional changes that are
   expected to the v3 vocabulary that are being discussed.  Also note
   that changes to the design choices for the differences are also
   expected.

1.1.  Design Criteria for the Changes in v3

   The design criteria of the changes from v2 to v3 are:

   o  The intention is that starting and editing a v3 document will be
      easier than for a v2 document.

   o  There will be good v2-to-v3 conversion tools for when an author
      wants to change versions.

   o  There are no current plans to make v3 XML the required submission
      format for drafts or RFCs.  That might happen eventually, but it
      is likely to be years away.



Hoffman                 Expires October 21, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   There is a desire to keep as much of the v2 grammar as makes sense
   within the above design criteria and not to make gratuitous changes
   to the v2 grammar.  Another way to say this is "we would rather
   encourage backward compatibility but not be constrained by it".
   Still, the goal of starting and editing a v3 document being easier
   than for a v2 document is more important than backwards compatibility
   with v2, given the latter two design criteria.

   v3 is upwards compatible with v2, meaning that a v2 document is meant
   to be a valid v3 document as well.  However, some features of v2 are
   deprecated in v3 in favor of new elements.  Deprecated features are
   described in [XML2RFCv2].

   The canonical RFCs will not have any markup that uses a deprecated
   feature.  The processor described in Appendix B will have a "convert
   with warnings" mode that will convert a v2 document to a v3 document
   that converts deprecated features wherever possible, issuing warnings
   for where it cannot convert.  The processor will also have a "strict"
   mode that will issue errors if any deprecated features are in the
   input.

1.2.  Differences from v2 to v3

   The format changes in v3 are listed in the following subsections.

1.2.1.  New Elements in v3

   o  Add <dl>, <ul>, and <ol> as new ways to make lists.  This is a
      significant change from v2 in that the child under these elements
      is <li>, not <t>. <li> has a model of either containing one or
      more <t> elements, or containing the flowing text normally found
      in <t>.

   o  Add <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, and <tt> for character formatting.

   o  Add <aside> for incidental text that will be indented when
      displayed.

   o  Add <sourcecode> to differentiate from <artwork>.

   o  Add <blockquote> to indicate a quotation as in a paragraph-like
      format.

   o  Add <titleelement> to sections, figures, and texttables to allow
      character formatting (fixed-width font) in their titles, and to
      allow references.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   o  Add <postalLine>, free text that represents one line of the
      address.

   o  Add <displayreference> to allow display of more mneumonic anchor
      names for automatically-included references.

   o  Add <refcontent> to allow better control of text in a reference.

1.2.2.  New Attributes for Existing Elements

   o  Add "sortRefs", "symRefs", "tocDepth", and "tocInclude" attributes
      to <rfc> to cover processor instructions (PIs) that were in v2
      that are still needed in the grammar.

   o  Add "ascii" attributes to <author>, <email>, and <organization>.
      This allows an author to specify their information in their native
      scripts as the primary entry and still allow the ASCII-equivalent
      values to appear in the processed documents.

   o  Add "xml:lang" attribute to <artwork>, <postal>, and <author>.
      This is sometimes useful for renderers which display different
      fonts for ideographic characters used in China and Japan.

   o  Add the "section", "relative", and "sectionFormat" attributes to
      <xref>.

   o  Add the "numbered" and "removeinrfc" attributes to <section>.

   o  Add "autogeneratedBoilerplateText", "autogeneratedSectionNumber",
      "autogeneratedFigureNumber", and "autogeneratedTableNumber"
      attributes to <rfc>, <section>, <figure>, and <texttable>,
      respectively.  These will be filled in by the RFC processor so
      that the canonical XML file has all of the same information as the
      non-canonical formats.

1.2.3.  Elements and Attributes Deprecated from v2

   o  Deprecate <list> in favor of <dl>, <ul>, and <ol>.

   o  Deprecate <spanx>; replace it with <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, and
      <tt>.

   o  Deprecate <vspace> because the major use for it, creating pseudo-
      paragraph-breaks in lists, is now handled properly.

   o  Deprecate <facsimile> because it is rarely used and is not
      actually useful.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   o  Deprecate <format> because it is not useful and has caused
      surprise for authors in the past.

   o  Deprecate the "title" attribute in <section>, <figure>, and
      <texttable> in favor of the new <titleelement>.

   o  Deprecate the "alt", "height", "src", and "width" attributes in
      <figure> because they overlap with the attributes in <artwork>.

   o  Deprecate the "xml:space" attribute in <artwork> because there was
      only one useful value.  Deprecate "height" and "width" attribute.

   o  Deprecate the "pageno" attribute in <xref> because it was unused
      in v2.  Deprecate the "none" and "title" values for the "format"
      attribute in <xref> because the former makes no sense semantically
      and the latter because it has unpredictable output.

1.2.4.  Additional Changes from v2

   o  Allow <artwork> to be used on its own in <section> (no longer
      confine it to a figure).

   o  Give more specifics of handling the "type" attribute in <artwork>.

   o  In <address>, allow the sub-elements to be in any order.

   o  Allow <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <tt>, <eref>, and <xref> in
      <cref>.

   o  Allow the sub-elements inside a <reference> to be in any order.

   o  Turned off the auto-generation of anchors in <cref> because there
      is no use case for them that cannot be achieved in other ways.

   o  Allow more than one <artwork>, or more than one <sourcecode>, in
      <figure>.

   o  In <front>, make <date> optional.

   o  In <postal>, allow the sub-elements to be in any order.  Also
      allow the inclusion of the new <postalLine> instead of the older
      elements.

   o  In <ttcol>, allow <xref>, <eref>, <iref>, and <cref> as optional
      children.

   o  Do not generate the grammar from a DTD, but instead get it
      directly from the Relax Next Generation (RNG) grammar.

1.3.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix C (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

   Many elements have an optional "anchor" attribute.  In all cases, the
   value of the "anchor" attribute needs to be a valid XML "Name"
   (Section 2.3 of [XML]).  In short, it is a text string with no spaces
   or colons; hyphens and underscores are allowed.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  See [RFCSTYLE] for more
   information on restrictions for the abstract.

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area to which this document
   relates (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the fullname or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>.
   The list at the time that this document is being published is:
   "Applications", "app", "General", "gen", "Internet", "int",
   "Operations and Management", "ops", "Real-time Applications and
   Infrastructure", "rai", "Routing", "rtg", "Security", "sec",
   "Transport", "tsv", but that list will likely change over time.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.27).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks, and thus is used for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing, using a URI.  In
   this case, the textual content acts as fallback for output formats
   that do not support graphics, and thus ought to contain either a
   "line art" variant of the graphics, or otherwise prose that describes
   the included image in sufficient detail.

   If the artwork includes either "&" or "<" characters, those
   characters either need to be escaped or the artwork needs to be in a
   CDATA structure; see <sourcecode> for a fuller description of these
   solutions.

   In [XML2RFCv2], the <artwork> element was also used for source code
   and formal languages; in v3, this is now done with <sourcecode>.

   This element appears as child element of: <aside> (Section 2.6),
   <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <dd> (Section 2.17), <figure>

   Content model:

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the artwork).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]) as well, in which case
   the graphics file is wholly part of the XML file.

   [[anchor8: Add an example of in-lined SVG here.]]

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A private
   processor (as described in Appendix B might add type-specific
   formatting to artwork with the preferred values in the non-canonical
   output formats.  If a processor encounters a value for "type" that is
   not one of the preferred values, it can issue a warning but should
   still use the artwork as if it had no "type" attribute.

   The preferred values for <artwork> types are:

   o  ascii-art

   o  call-flow

   o  hex-dump

   o  svg

   The RFC Editor will maintain a complete list of the preferred values
   on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over time.
   Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.8.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for ideographic
   characters used in China and Japan.

2.5.9.  'xml:space' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.6.  <aside>

   This element is a container for content that is semantically less
   important or tangential to the content that surrounds it.  The
   elements inside this container are indented from both margins when
   displayed.

   This element appears as child element of: <section> (Section 2.47).

2.7.  <author>

   Provides information about a document author.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".  For RFCs, it is the
   stream that determines who is listed as authors or editors.

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.27).

   Content model:

   In this order:

2.7.1.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's full name.

2.7.2.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.7.3.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   The value contains one or more initials, each followed by a period.

2.7.4.  'role' attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.7.5.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname.

2.7.6.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.8.  <b>

   Causes the text to be displayed in bold.  It is almost always a
   better idea to use the <strong> element instead.

2.16.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the
   document being produced, and also inside bibliographic references
   that use the <front> element.

   In the first case, it defines the publication date, which, when
   producing Internet-Drafts, will be used for computing the expiration
   date (see [IDGUIDE]).  When "year", "month" or "day" are left out,
   the processor will attempt to use the current system date if the
   attributes that are specified do match the system date.

   Note that month names, if given, need to match the full English month
   name{ "January", "February", "March", "April", "May, "June", "July",
   "August", "September", "October", "November", or "December".

   In the second case, the date information will be embedded as-is into
   the reference text.  Therefore, also vague dates ("ca. 2000"), date
   ranges, and so on, are allowed.

2.44.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"

2.47.  <section>

   Represents a section (when inside a <middle> element) or an appendix
   (when inside a <back> element).

   Sub-sections are created by nesting <section> elements inside
   <section> elements.  Sections are allowed to be empty.

   This element appears as child element of: <back> (Section 2.9),
   <middle> (Section 2.33), and <section> (Section 2.47).

   Content model:

2.47.3.  'numbered' attribute

   If set to "no", this section does not get a section number.
   Processors will verify that such a section is not followed by a
   numbered section in a part, and will verify that the section is a
   top-level section.

   Allowed values:

   o  "yes" (default)

   o  "no"

2.47.4.  'removeInRFC' attribute

   If set to "yes", this section is marked in the processor with text
   indicating that it should be removed before the document is published
   as an RFC.

   Allowed values:

   o  "yes"

   o  "no" (default)

2.47.5.  'title' attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <titleelement> instead.

2.47.6.  'toc' attribute

   Indicates to a processor whether or not the section is to be included
   in the table of contents.  This only takes effect if the level of the
   section would have appeared in the table of contents based on the
   "tocDepth" attribute of the <rfc> element, and of course only if the
   table of contents is being created based on the "tocInclude"
   attribute of the <rfc> element.  If this is set to "exclude", any
   section below this one will be excluded as well.  The "default" value
   indicates to include the section if it would be included by the
   tocDepth attribute of the <rfc> element.

   Allowed values:

   o  "include"

   o  "exclude"

2.48.  <seriesInfo>

   Specifies the document series in which this document appears, and
   also specifies an identifier within that series.

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.43).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.48.1.  'name' attribute (mandatory)

   The name of the series.

   The following names trigger specific processing (such as for auto-
   generating links, and adding descriptions such as "work in
   progress"): "BCP", "FYI", "Internet-Draft", "RFC", and "STD".

2.48.2.  'value' attribute (mandatory)

   The identifier within the series specified by the "name" attribute.

   For BCPs, FYIs, RFCs, and STDs this is the number within the series.
   For Internet-Drafts, it is the full draft name (ending with the two-
   digit version number).

2.49.  <sourcecode>

   This element allows the inclusion of sourcecode into the document.

   <sourcecode> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks.  It is thus useful for source code and formal languages (such
   as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this document).

   For artwork such as character-based art, diagrams of message layouts,
   and so on, use the <artwork> element instead.

   A common problem authors have with <sourcecode> is that the XML
   processor returns errors if the text in the artwork contains either
   the "&" or "<" character.  To avoid these problems, the artwork needs
   to be surrounded in a CDATA structure: "<![CDATA[]]".  For example:

   <artwork>
   <![CDATA[allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&" | "<" | ">" | "|"]]
   </artwork>

   Instead of using a CDATA structure, the authour could instead escape

   (Section 2.25), <li> (Section 2.31), <section> (Section 2.47), and
   <t> (Section 2.53).

   Content model: only text content.

2.49.1.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).  This attribute generally isn't used for document
   generation, but it can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as
   automated syntax checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.49.2.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the sourcecode.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A private
   processor (as described in Appendix B might add type-specific
   formatting to sourcecode with the preferred values in the non-
   canonical output formats.  If a processor encounters a value for
   "type" that is not one of the preferred values, it can issue a
   warning but should still use the artwork as if it had no "type"
   attribute.

   The preferred values for <sourcecode> types are:

   o  abnf

   o  asn.1

   o  bash

   o  c++

   o  c

   o  cbor

   o  dtd

   o  java

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.61.  <vspace>

   Deprecated.

   This element appears as child element of: <t> (Section 2.53).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.61.1.  'blankLines' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.62.  <workgroup>

   This element is used to specify the Working Group (IETF) or Research
   Group (IRTF) from which the document originates, if any.  The
   recommended format is the official name of the Working Group (with
   some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property on the <rfc>
   element (Section 2.46.11).

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.27).

   Content model: only text content.

2.63.  <xref>

   Inserts a reference to a different part of a document.

   The generated text depends on whether the <xref> is empty (in which
   case the processor will try to generate a meaningful text fragment),
   and the nature of the referenced document part. [[anchor11: Need to
   say more about the processor output if the element is empyt and if it
   has text.]]

   Any element that allows the "anchor" attribute can be referenced,
   however there are restrictions with respect to the text content being
   generated.  For instance, a <t> can be a reference target, however,
   because paragraphs are not (visibly) numbered, the author will have
   to make sure that the prose is sufficient for a reader to understand

2.63.1.  'format' attribute

   This attribute is used to control the format of the generated
   reference text.

   "counter"

      Inserts just a counter; this use used for the number of a section,
      figure, or table.  For example:

     <section anchor="overview">Protocol Overview</section>
     . . .
     See Section <xref target="overview" format="counter"/>
     for an overview.

      might generate

     See Section 1.7 for an overview.

   "default"

      Inserts a text fragment that describes the referenced part
      completely, such as "Section 2" or "Table 4" for internal links,
      or "[XML]" for links to references.  For example:

     <section anchor="overview">Protocol Overview</section>
     . . .
     See <xref target="overview"/> for an overview.

      might generate

     See Section 1.7 for an overview.

   "title"

      This attribute value is deprecated.

   Allowed values:

   o  "counter"

   o  "title"

   o  "none"

   o  "default" (default)

2.63.2.  'pageno' attribute

   Deprecated.

   Allowed values:

   o  "comma"

   o  "parens"

   For example:

     See <xref target="RFC6949" section="2.3" sectionFormat="of"/>
     for more inforation.
     See <xref target="RFC6949" section="2.4" sectionFormat="comma"/>
     for more inforation.
     See <xref target="RFC6949" section="2.5" sectionFormat="parens"/>
     for more inforation.

   would generate

        See Section 2.3 of [RFC6949] for more information.
        See [RFC6949], Section 2.4 for more information.
        See [RFC6949] (Section 2.5) for more information.

2.63.6.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   Identifies the document component being referenced.

   The value needs to match the value of the "anchor" attribute of
   another element in the document.

3.  Special Unicode Code Points

   Although the current RFC format does not allow non-ASCII Unicode
   characters ([UNICODE]), some of them can be used to enforce certain
   behaviors of formatters.

   For instance:

   non-breaking space (U+00A0)

      Represents a space character where no line break should happen.
      This is frequenly used in titles (by excluding certain space
      characters from the line breaking algorithm, the processor will
      use the remaining whitespace ocurrences for line breaks).

   non-breaking hyphen (U+2011)

      Similarly, this represents a hyphen character where nevertheless
      no line breaking ought to occur.

   word joiner (U+2060)




Hoffman                 Expires October 21, 2014               [Page 58]

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


      Also called "zero width non-breaking space".  This can be used to
      disallow line breaking between two non-whitespace characters.

   Note that in order to use these characters by name, they need to be
   declared either in the Document Type Definition (DTD, [XML], Section
   2.9), or in the "internal subset" ([XML], Section 2.8), like this:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>

   <!DOCTYPE rfc [

     <!-- declare nbsp and friends -->
     <!ENTITY nbsp    "&#xa0;">
     <!ENTITY nbhy    "&#x2011;">
     <!ENTITY wj      "&#x2060;">
   ]>

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.

   However, the current canonical RFC format is restricted to US-ASCII
   [USASCII] characters ([RFC2223], Section 3).  Future versions are
   likely to relax this role, and it is expected that the vocabulary
   will be extended so that US-ASCII alternatives can be provided when
   that makes sense (for instance, in contact information).

5.  Security Considerations

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   The "type" attribute of the <artwork> and <sourcecode> elements is
   meant to encourage processors to automatically extract known types of
   content from an RFC or Internet Draft.  While extraction is probalby
   safe, those processors might also think that they could further
   process the extracted content such as by rendering artwork or
   executing code.  Doing so without first sanity-checking the extracted
   content is clearly a terrible idea from a security perspective.  More
   generally, a processor that is reading RFCs or Internet Drafts needs
   to be suspicious of any content that it intends to post-process.

   Furthermore, all security considerations related to XML processing
   are relevant as well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document updates the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml" from the one in [XML2RFCv2].  The following is
   to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that either
      transform xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML,
      plus additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be uses as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the category determines the "maturity level" (see Section 4
   of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for

   "Experimental", and "historic" for "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values
   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the <date> element when archiving
      the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of submission.

   Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER.  For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the submissionType
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP, that
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further
   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "correct" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978" and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3978 (March 2005).

A.2.2.3.  Historic Values: '*3667'

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in RFC 2026 (October 1996).

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet-Draft.

Appendix B.  The v3 Format and Processors

   As described in [RFC6949], the v3 format will be the format for
   canonical RFCs.  The format will also likely be allowed for
   submission of Internet Drafts.  The format for both of these tasks is
   the same; however, software processing an XML file for creation of an

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   Internet Draft will act differently than it will for creation of what
   is expected to be an RFC.

   This section describes topics that ares specific to processors.  Note
   that there is some discussion of processors in the main body of the
   document as well.  For example, some elements have descriptions of
   how a processor might create output from the element.

   In v2, the grammar was specified as a DTD.  In v3, the grammar is
   specified only as Relax Next Generation (RNG).  This means that
   processors most work from the RNG, not from a DTD.  In fact, the
   author believes that some of the features of the v3 grammar cannot be
   specified as a DTD.

   This section differentiates between three types of processors:

   o  RFC Processor -- The processor used by the RFC Editor to validate
      the contents of the intended RFC and to create the non-canonical
      formats that will be published by the RFC Editor.

   o  Draft Processor -- The processor used by the IETF to validate the
      contents of XML that is submitted and to create the other formats
      that will be supported for Internet Drafts; to produce interim
      versions of the non-canonical formats so that authors can see how
      their XML might later be rendered; and to convert documents that
      use the v2 format to v3.

   o  Private Processors -- There may be processors that are meant to
      run on the computers of authors.  These processors may be used to
      produce interim versions of the non-canonical formats so that
      authors can see how their XML might later be rendered; to create
      documents in formats different than those supported by the RFC
      Editor; and to convert XML that has external information into XML
      that has that external information included.

   It is expected that a single piece of software will be used for both
   the RFC Processor and the Draft Processor, with different application
   settings to differentiate between them.  For example, some XML that
   is valid for Internet Drafts will not be valid for canonical RFCs, so
   the Draft Processor can be set to give warnings for those features
   but the RFC Processor can be set to give hard errors.  It is also
   expected that the same software could be used as a Private Processor;
   others might create Private Processors independently, or using parts
   of, the software used by the RFC Editor.

   Users of current and older XML processors for Internet Drafts and
   RFCs may be used to them having unhelpful error messages.  Beginning
   with v3, the RFC Processor and Draft Processor will have much better

   error reporting, giving more context than just a line number.  For
   example, the error messages will differentiate between errors in XML
   and those from the v3 format.

B.1.  Including External Text

   All XML processors for v3 are expected to support XInclude
   [XInclude].  XInclude specifies a processing model and syntax for
   general purpose inclusion of information that is either on the
   Internet or local to the user's computer.

   In the v3 format, XInclude is expressed as the <xi:include>> element.
   To use this element, you need to include the "xi" namespace in the
   <rfc> element; that is, you need to specify

   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

   as one of the attributes in the <rfc> element.

   The most common way to use <xi:include> is to pull in references that
   are already formed as XML.  Currently, this is done from
   xml.resource.org, but later is expected to be from the RFC Editor.
   For example, if a document has three normative refernces, all RFCs,
   the document might contain:

   <references>
       <xi:include href="http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.2119.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.4869.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.7169.xml"/>
   </references>

   <xi:include> can be used anywhere where an XML element could be used
   (but not where free text is used).  For example, if three Internet
   Drafts are all including a particular paragraph or section verbatim,
   that text can be kept either in a file or somewhere on the web, and
   be included with <xi:include>.  An example of pulling something from
   the local disk would be:

   <x:include href="file://home/chris/ietf/drafts/commontext.xml"/>

   [[anchor18: Need to think a bit more about using xi:include to
   replace src= for artwork or sourcecode.]]

B.2.  The RFC Processor

   The canonical format for RFCs have a number of restrictions that the
   RFC Processor needs to enforce before a document can be published in
   its final form.  In this "final" mode, the processor will give a hard
   error when an input XML file has:

   o  any element or attribute listed as "deprecated" in the v3
      vocabulary

   o  XML comments

   o  XML Processor Instructions (PIs)

   o  an external DTD

   o  ENTITYs that have a SYSTEM component

   o  <artwork> elements with a "src" attribute that points to a URI
      with a scheme other than "data:"

   o  <cref> elements

   The RFC Processor will also have a mode that gives hard errors on all
   of the above other than <cref> elements.  This is to allow the RPC to
   insert <cref> elements in the working XML for notes to authors in
   AUTH 48, notes to IANA, and so on.

   The RFC Processor will also generate values for
   "autogeneratedBoilerplateText", "autogeneratedSectionNumber",
   "autogeneratedFigureNumber", and "autogeneratedTableNumber"
   attributes in <rfc>, <section>, <figure>, and <texttable>,
   respectively.

B.3.  The Draft Processor

   The Draft Processor will help in the transition from the v2 format to
   the v3 format.  A user could request that the Draft Processor convert
   a v2 document to v3, using the new features of v3 where appropriate,
   and removing the parts that are no longer supported.  The processor
   might be able to fully convert a v2 document to v3, or it might have
   to only give advice on some of the v2 features that could not be
   automatically converted.

   The Draft Processor should have a mode that mimics the RFC
   Processor's restictive mode, but that instead gives warningis instead
   of hard errors.

B.4.  Processor Instructions

   In the v2 format, XML PIs were used for a wide variety of tasks,
   including changing some formatting of the text outputs, adding
   information to HTML versions of Internet Drafts, and specifying other
   instructions to processors.  In the v3 format, a much smaller set of
   PIs is supported for the Draft Processor and Private Processors.  It
   is important to note that canonical RFCs will not contain any PIs.

   The following PIs will be supported by the Draft Processor:

   o  editing -- When set ot "yes", causes the processor to insert
      reference numbers throughout the output files to allow ease of
      referral to particular paragraphs or artwork in the text.  The
      default is "no".

   The following PIs will not be supported by the Draft Processor, but
   are included so that Private Processors have a common way of
   referring to them:

   o  comments -- When set to "yes", causes all <cref> elements to be
      rendered in the output files.  The default is "yes".

   o  linefile -- Causes the processor to emit more detailed information
      about which line of which input file caused an error or warning.

   Note that a Private Processor can have PIs not from this list.
