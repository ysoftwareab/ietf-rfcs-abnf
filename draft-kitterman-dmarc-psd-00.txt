DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
               Extension For PSDs (Public Suffix Domains)
                      draft-kitterman-dmarc-psd-00

Abstract

   DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and
   Conformance) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating
   organization can express domain-level policies and preferences for
   message validation, disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving
   organization can use to improve mail handling.  DMARC policies can be
   applied at the individual domain level or for a set of domains at the
   organizational level.  The design of DMARC precludes grouping
   policies for a set of domains above the organizational level, such as
   TLDs (Top Level Domains).  These types of domains (which are not all
   at the top level of the DNS tree) can be collectively referred to as
   Public Suffix Domains (PSDs).  For the subset of PSDs that require
   DMARC usage, this memo describes an extension to DMARC to enable
   DMARC functionality for such domains.

1.  Introduction

   DMARC [RFC7489] provides a mechanism for publishing organizational
   policy information to email receivers.  DMARC [RFC7489] allows policy
   to be specified for both individual domains and sets of domains
   within a single organization.  For domains above the organizational



Kitterman                Expires April 28, 2019                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                  PSD DMARC                   October 2018


   level in the DNS tree, policy can only be published for the exact
   domain.  There is no method available to such domains to express
   lower level policy or receive feedback reporting for sets of domains.
   This prevents policy application to non-existent domains and
   identification of domain abuse in email, which can be important for
   brand and consumer protection.

   As an example, imagine a country code TLD (ccTLD) which has public
   subdomains for government and commercial use (.gov.example and
   .com.example).  Within the .gov.example public suffix, use of DMARC
   [RFC7489] has been mandated and .gov.example has published its own
   DMARC [RFC7489] record:

   "v=DMARC1;p=reject;rua=mailto:dmarc@dmarc.service.gov.example"

   at

   _dmarc.gov.example.

   This would provide policy and feedback for mail sent from
   @gov.example, but not @tax.gov.example and there is no way to publish
   an organizational level policy that would do so.  While, in theory,
   receivers could reject mail from non-existent domains, not all
   receivers do so.  Non-existence of the sending domain can be a factor
   in a mail delivery decision, but is not generally treated as
   definitive on its own.

   This memo provides a simple extension to DMARC [RFC7489] to allow
   operators of Public Suffix Domains (PSDs) to express policy for
   groups of subdomains, extends the DMARC [RFC7489] policy query
   functionality to detect and process such a policy, describes receiver
   feedback for such policies, and provides controls to mitigate
   potential privacy considerations associated with this extension.

   There are two types of Public Suffix Operators (PSOs) for which this
   extension would be useful and appropriate:

   o  Branded PSDs (e.g., ".google"): These domains are effectively
      Organizational Domains as discussed in DMARC [RFC7489].  They
      control all subdomains of the tree.  These are effectively private
      domains, but listed in the Public Suffix List.  They are treated
      as Public for DMARC [RFC7489] purposes.  They require the same
      protections as DMARC [RFC7489] Organizational Domains, but are
      currently excluded.

   o  Multi-organization PSDs that require DMARC usage (e.g., ".bank"):
      Because existing Organizational Domains using this PSD have their
      own DMARC policy, the applicability of this extension is for non-

      existent domains.  The extension allows the brand protection
      benefits of DMARC [RFC7489] to extend to the entire PSD, including
      cousin domains of registered organizations.

   Due to the design of DMARC [RFC7489] and the nature of the Internet
   email architecture [RFC5598], there are interoperability issues
   associated with DMARC [RFC7489] deployment.  These are discussed in
   Interoperability Issues between DMARC and Indirect Email Flows
   [RFC7960].  These issues are not applicable to PSDs, since they
   (e.g., the ".gov.example" used above) do not send mail.

   DMARC [RFC7489], by design, does not support usage by PSD operators.
   For PSDs that require use of DMARC [RFC7489], an extension of DMARC
   reporting and enforcement capability is needed for PSD operators to
   effectively manage and monitor implementation of PSD requirements.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]  when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Public Suffix Domain (PSD)

   The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in
   numerous Requests for Comment (RFC).  It defines a tree of names
   starting with root, ".", immediately below which are Top Level Domain
   names such as ".com" and ".us".  They are not available for private
   registration.  In many cases the public portion of the DNS tree is
   more than one level deep.  PSD DMARC includes all public domains
   above the organizational level in the tree, e.g., ".gov.uk".

2.3.  Longest PSD

   Organizational Domain (DMARC [RFC7489] Section 3.2) with one label
   removed.

2.4.  Public Suffix Operator (PSO)

   A Public Suffix Operator manages operations within their PSD.

2.5.  PSO Controlled Domain Names

   PSO Controlled Domain Names are names in the DNS that are managed by
   a PSO and are not available for use as Organizational Domains (the
   term Organizational Domains is defined in DMARC [RFC7489]
   Section 3.2).  Depending on PSD policy, these will have one (e.g.,
   ".com") or more (e.g., ".co.uk") name components.

2.6.  Non-existent Domains

   For DMARC [RFC7489] purposes, a non-existent domain is a domain name
   that publishes none of A, AAAA, or MX records that the receiver is
   willing to accept.  This is a broader definition than that in
   NXDOMAIN [RFC8020].

3.  PSD DMARC Updates to DMARC Requirements

   This document updates DMARC [RFC7489] as follows:

3.1.  General Updates

   References to "Domain Owners" also apply to PSOs.

3.2.  Section 6.1 DMARC Policy Record

   PSD DMARC records are published as a subdomain of the PSD.  For the
   PSD ".example", the PSO would post DMARC policy in a TXT record at
   "_dmarc.example".

3.3.  Section 6.5.  Domain Owner Actions

   In addition to the DMARC [RFC7489] domain owner actions, PSOs will
   need to update the "DMARC Public Suffix Domain (PSD) Registry".  This
   registry is defined in Section 6.1.

3.4.  Section 6.6.3.  Policy Discovery

   A new step between step 3 and 4 is added:

   3A.  If the set is now empty and the longest PSD (Section 2.3) of the
      Organizational Domain is listed in the DMARC PSD Registry (defined
      in Section 6.1), the Mail Receiver MUST query the DNS for a DMARC
      TXT record at the DNS domain matching the longest PSD
      (Section 2.3) in place of the RFC5322.From domain in the message
      (if different).  A possibly empty set of records is returned.

   As an example, for a message with the Organizational Domain of
   "example.compute.cloudcompany.com.cctld", the query for PSD DMARC



Kitterman                Expires April 28, 2019                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  PSD DMARC                   October 2018


   would use "compute.cloudcompany.com.cctld" as the longest PSD
   (Section 2.3).  The receiver would check to see if that PSD is listed
   in the DMARC PSD Registry, and if so, perform the policy lookup at
   "_dmarc.compute.cloudcompany.com.cctld".

   Note: Because the PSD policy query comes after the Organizational
   Domain policy query, PSD policy is not used for Organizational
   domains that have published a DMARC [RFC7489] policy.  Specifically,
   this is not a mechanism to provide feedback addresses (RUA/RUF) when
   an Organizational Domain has declined to do so.

3.5.  Section 7.  DMARC Feedback

   Operational note for PSD DMARC: For PSOs, feedback for non-existent
   domains is desired and useful.  Because of the constraints on PSD
   DMARC scope, there are no significant privacy considerations
   associated with this reporting (See Section 4).

4.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not significantly change the Privacy
   Considerations of [RFC7489].

4.1.  Feedback leakage

   Providing feedback reporting to PSOs can, in some cases, create
   leakage of information outside of an organization to the PSO.  There
   are roughly three cases to consider:

   o  Branded PSDs (e.g., ".google"), RUA and RUF reports based on PSD
      DMARC have the potential to contain information about emails
      related to entities managed by the organization.  Since both the
      PSO and the Organizational Domain owners are common, there is no
      privacy risk for either normal or non-existent Domain reporting.

   o  Multi-organization PSDs that require DMARC usage (e.g., ".bank"):
      PSD DMARC based reports will only be generated for domains that do
      not publish a DMARC policy at the organizational or host level.
      For domains that do publish the required DMARC policy records, the
      feedback reporting addresses (RUA and RUF) of the organization (or
      hosts) will be used.  Since PSD DMARC is limited to PSDs that
      mandate Organizational Domains publish DMARC policy for existing
      domains, the risk of this issue is limited to Organizational
      Domains that are out of compliance with PSD policy.

   o  Multi-organization PSDs (e.g., ".com") that do not mandate DMARC
      usage.  Privacy risks for Organizational Domains within such PSDs
      would be significant.  This is mitigated by the limitation to only

Internet-Draft                  PSD DMARC                   October 2018


      include PSDs listed in the public IANA DMARC PSD Registry
      described in Section 6.1.

   PSOs will receive feedback on non-existent domains, which may be
   similar to existing Organizational Domains.  Feedback related to such
   cousin domains have a small risk of carrying information related to
   an actual Organizational Domain.  To minimize this potential concern,
   PSD DMARC feedback is best limited to Aggregate Reports.  Feedback
   Reports carry more detailed information and present a greater risk.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7489].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes actions requested to be completed by IANA.

6.1.  DMARC Public Suffix Domain (PSD) Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new DMARC Public Suffix Domain (PSD)
   Registry within the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
   and Conformance (DMARC) Parameters Registry.

   Names of PSDs participating in PSD DMARC must be registered with IANA
   in this new sub-registry.  New entries are assigned only for PSDs
   that require use of DMARC.  The requirement has to be documented in a
   manner that satisfies the terms of Expert Review, per [RFC5226].  The
   Designated Expert needs to confirm that provided documentation
   adequately describes PSD policy to require domain owners to use DMARC
   or that all domain owners are part of a single organization with the
   PSO.

   The initial set of entries in this registry is as follows:

   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   |    PSD      | Reference      | Status        |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   | .bank       | this document  | current       |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   | .insurance  | this document  | current       |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   | .gov.uk     | this document  | current       |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
