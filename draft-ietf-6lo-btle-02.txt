       Transmission of IPv6 Packets over BLUETOOTH(R) Low Energy
                         draft-ietf-6lo-btle-02

Abstract

   Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy
   feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth
   Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely
   implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio
   headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth
   is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
   devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low
   power variant of Bluetooth is standardized since the revision 4.0 of
   the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is
   required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported
   over Bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

1.  Introduction

   Bluetooth low energy (LE) is a radio technology targeted for devices
   that operate with coin cell batteries or minimalistic power sources,
   which means that low power consumption is essential.  Bluetooth LE is
   an especially attractive technology for Internet of Things

   applications, such as health monitors, environmental sensing,
   proximity applications and many others.

   Considering the potential for the exponential growth in the number of
   sensors and Internet connected devices and things, IPv6 is an ideal
   protocol due to the large address space it provides.  In addition,
   IPv6 provides tools for stateless address autoconfiguration, which is
   particularly suitable for sensor network applications and nodes which
   have very limited processing power or lack a full-fledged operating
   system.

   RFC 4944 [RFC4944] specifies the transmission of IPv6 over IEEE
   802.15.4.  The Bluetooth LE link in many respects has similar
   characteristics to that of IEEE 802.15.4.  Many of the mechanisms
   defined in the RFC 4944 can be applied to the transmission of IPv6 on
   Bluetooth LE links.  This document specifies the details of IPv6
   transmission over Bluetooth LE links.

1.1.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms 6LN, 6LR and 6LBR are defined as in [RFC6775], with an
   addition that Bluetooth LE central and Bluetooth LE peripheral (see
   Section 2.2) can both be either 6LN or 6LBR.

2.  Bluetooth Low Energy

   Bluetooth LE is designed for transferring small amounts of data
   infrequently at modest data rates at a very low cost per bit.
   Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) has introduced two
   trademarks, Bluetooth Smart for single-mode devices (a device that
   only supports Bluetooth LE) and Bluetooth Smart Ready for dual-mode
   devices (devices that support both Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE).  In
   the rest of the document, the term Bluetooth LE refers to both types
   of devices.

   Bluetooth LE was introduced in Bluetooth 4.0 and further enhanced in
   Bluetooth 4.1 [BTCorev4.1].  Bluetooth SIG will also publish Internet
   Protocol Support Profile (IPSP) [IPSP], which includes Internet
   Protocol Support Service (IPSS) and that enables discovery of IP-
   enabled devices and establishment of link-layer connection for
   transporting IPv6 packets.  IPv6 over Bluetooth LE is dependent on
   both Bluetooth 4.1 and IPSP.

   Devices such as mobile phones, notebooks, tablets and other handheld
   computing devices which will include Bluetooth 4.1 chipsets will also
   have the low-energy functionality of Bluetooth.  Bluetooth LE will
   also be included in many different types of accessories that
   collaborate with mobile devices such as phones, tablets and notebook
   computers.  An example of a use case for a Bluetooth LE accessory is
   a heart rate monitor that sends data via the mobile phone to a server
   on the Internet.

2.1.  Bluetooth LE stack

   The lower layer of the Bluetooth LE stack consists of the Physical
   (PHY) and the Link Layer (LL).  The Physical Layer transmits and
   receives the actual packets.  The Link Layer is responsible for
   providing medium access, connection establishment, error control and
   flow control.  The upper layer consists of the Logical Link Control
   and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP), Attribute Protocol (ATT), Generic
   Attribute Profile (GATT) and Generic Access Profile (GAP) as shown in
   Figure 1.  The device internal Host Controller Interface (HCI)
   separates the lower layers, often implemented in the Bluetooth
   controller, from higher layers, often implemented in the host stack.
   GATT and Bluetooth LE profiles together enable the creation of
   applications in a standardized way without using IP.  L2CAP provides
   multiplexing capability by multiplexing the data channels from the
   above layers.  L2CAP also provides fragmentation and reassembly for
   large data packets.

2.2.  Link layer roles and topology

   Bluetooth LE defines two GAP roles of relevance herein: the Bluetooth
   LE central role and the Bluetooth LE peripheral role.  A device in
   the central role, which is called central from now on, has
   traditionally been able to manage multiple simultaneous connections
   with a number of devices in the peripheral role, called peripherals
   from now on.  A peripheral is commonly connected to a single central,
   but since Bluetooth 4.1 can also connect to multiple centrals.  In
   this document for IPv6 networking purposes the Bluetooth LE network
   (i.e. a Bluetooth LE piconet) follows a star topology shown in the
   Figure 2, where the router typically implements the Bluetooth LE
   central role and nodes implement the Bluetooth LE peripheral role.
   In the future mesh networking may be defined for IPv6 over Bluetooth
   LE.

                  Node --.      .-- Node
                          \    /
                Node ---- Router ---- Node
                          /    \
                  Node --'      '-- Node

                   Figure 2: Bluetooth LE Star Topology

   In Bluetooth LE a central is assumed to be less constrained than a
   peripheral.  Hence, in the primary deployment scenario central and
   peripheral will act as 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) and a 6LoWPAN
   Node (6LN), respectively.

   In Bluetooth LE, direct communication only takes place between a
   central and a peripheral.  Hence, in a Bluetooth LE network using
   IPv6, a radio hop is equivalent to an IPv6 link and vice versa.

2.3.  Bluetooth LE device addressing

   Every Bluetooth LE device is identified by a 48-bit device address.
   The Bluetooth specification describes the device address of a
   Bluetooth LE device as:"Devices are identified using a device
   address.  Device addresses may be either a public device address or a
   random device address."  [BTCorev4.1].  The public device addresses
   are based on the IEEE 802-2001 standard [IEEE802-2001].  The random
   device addresses are generated as defined in the Bluetooth
   specification.  The device addresses are always unique within a
   Bluetooth LE piconet, but the random addresses are not guaranteed to
   be globally unique.

2.4.  Bluetooth LE packets sizes and MTU

   Optimal MTU defined for L2CAP fixed channels over Bluetooth LE is 27
   bytes including the L2CAP header of four bytes.  Default MTU for
   Bluetooth LE is hence defined to be 27 bytes.  Therefore, excluding
   L2CAP header of four bytes, protocol data unit (PDU) size of 23 bytes
   is available for upper layers.  In order to be able to transmit IPv6
   packets of 1280 bytes or larger, link layer fragmentation and
   reassembly solution is provided by the L2CAP layer.  The IPSP defines
   means for negotiating up a link-layer connection that provides MTU of
   1280 bytes or higher for the IPv6 layer [IPSP].  The link-layer MTU
   is negotiated separately for each direction.  Implementations that
   require single link-layer MTU value SHALL use the smallest of the
   possibly different MTU values.

3.  Specification of IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy

   Before any IP-layer communications can take place over Bluetooth LE,
   Bluetooth LE enabled nodes such as 6LNs and 6LBRs have to find each
   other and establish a suitable link-layer connection.  The discovery
   and Bluetooth LE connection setup procedures are documented by
   Bluetooth SIG in the IPSP specification [IPSP], and hence are out of
   scope of this document.  The IPSP depends on Bluetooth version 4.1,
   and hence both Bluetooth version 4.1 or newer and IPSP are required
   for IPv6 communications.

   Bluetooth LE technology sets strict requirements for low power
   consumption and thus limits the allowed protocol overhead. 6LoWPAN
   standards [RFC6775], and [RFC6282] provide useful functionality for
   reducing overhead which can be applied to Bluetooth LE.  This
   functionality comprises of link-local IPv6 addresses and stateless
   IPv6 address autoconfiguration (see Section 3.2.1), Neighbor
   Discovery (see Section 3.2.2) and header compression (see
   Section 3.2.3).

   A significant difference between IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth LE is
   that the former supports both star and mesh topology (and requires a
   routing protocol), whereas Bluetooth LE does not currently support
   the formation of multihop networks at the link layer.

3.1.  Protocol stack

   Figure 3 illustrates IPv6 over Bluetooth LE stack including the
   Internet Protocol Support Service.  UDP and TCP are provided as
   examples of transport protocols, but the stack can be used by any
   other upper layer protocol capable of running atop of IPv6.  The
   6LoWPAN layer runs on top of Bluetooth LE L2CAP layer.

3.2.  Link model

   The concept of IPv6 link (layer 3) and the physical link (combination
   of PHY and MAC) needs to be clear and the relationship has to be well
   understood in order to specify the addressing scheme for transmitting
   IPv6 packets over the Bluetooth LE link.  RFC 4861 [RFC4861] defines
   a link as "a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
   communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below
   IPv6."

   In the case of Bluetooth LE, 6LoWPAN layer is adapted to support
   transmission of IPv6 packets over Bluetooth LE.  The IPSP defines all
   steps required for setting up the Bluetooth LE connection over which
   6LoWPAN can function [IPSP], including handling the link-layer
   fragmentation required on Bluetooth LE, as described in Section 2.4.

   This specification also assumes the IPv6 header compression format
   specified in RFC 6282 is used [RFC6282].  It is also assumed that the
   IPv6 payload length can be inferred from the L2CAP header length and
   the IID value inferred from the link-layer address with help of
   Neighbor Cache, if elided from compressed packet header.

   Bluetooth LE connections used to build a star topology are point-to-
   point in nature, as Bluetooth broadcast features are not used for
   IPv6 over Bluetooth LE. 6LN-to-6LN communications, e.g. using link-
   local addresses, need to be bridged by the 6LBR.  The 6LBR ensures
   address collisions do not occur (see Section 3.2.2).

   After the peripheral and central have connected at the Bluetooth LE
   level, the link can be considered up and IPv6 address configuration
   and transmission can begin.

3.2.1.  Stateless address autoconfiguration

   A Bluetooth LE 6LN performs stateless address autoconfiguration as
   per RFC 4862 [RFC4862].  A 64-bit Interface identifier (IID) for a
   Bluetooth LE interface MAY be formed by utilizing the 48-bit
   Bluetooth device address (see Section 2.3) as defined in RFC 2464
   "IPv6 over Ethernet" specification [RFC2464].  Alternatively, a
   randomly generated IID (see Section 3.2.2) can be used instead, for
   example, as discussed in [I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids].  In the case
   of randomly generated IID or randomly generated Bluetooth device
   address, the "Universal/Local" bit MUST be set to 0 [RFC4291].  Only
   if the Bluetooth device address is known to be a public address the
   "Universal/Local" bit can be set to 1.

   As defined in RFC 4291 [RFC4291], the IPv6 link-local address for a
   Bluetooth LE node is formed by appending the IID, to the prefix
   FE80::/64, as depicted in Figure 4.


             10 bits        54 bits             64 bits

           +----------+-----------------+----------------------+


             Figure 4: IPv6 link-local address in Bluetooth LE

   The tool for a 6LBR to obtain an IPv6 prefix for numbering the
   Bluetooth LE network is out of scope of this document, but can be,
   for example, accomplished via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] or
   by using Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULA) [RFC4193].  Due to
   the link model of the Bluetooth LE (see Section 2.2) the 6LBR MUST
   set the "on-link" flag (L) to zero in the Prefix Information Option
   [RFC4861].  This will cause 6LNs to always send packets to the 6LBR,
   including the case when the destination is another 6LN using the same
   prefix.

3.2.2.  Neighbor discovery

   'Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
   Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)' [RFC6775] describes the neighbor
   discovery approach as adapted for use in several 6LoWPAN topologies,
   including the mesh topology.  Bluetooth LE does not support mesh
   networks and hence only those aspects that apply to a star topology
   are considered.

   The following aspects of the Neighbor Discovery optimizations
   [RFC6775] are applicable to Bluetooth LE 6LNs:

Internet-Draft           IPv6 over Bluetooth LE                June 2014


   1.  A Bluetooth LE 6LN MUST register its addresses with the 6LBR by
   sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with the Address
   Registration Option (ARO) and process the Neighbor Advertisement (NA)
   accordingly.  The NS with the ARO option MUST be sent irrespective of
   the method used to generate the IID.  The 6LN MUST register only one
   IPv6 address per IPv6 prefix available on a link.

   2.  For sending Router Solicitations and processing Router
   Advertisements the Bluetooth LE 6LNs MUST, respectively, follow
   Sections 5.3 and 5.4 of the [RFC6775].

3.2.3.  Header compression

   Header compression as defined in RFC 6282 [RFC6282], which specifies
   the compression format for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is
   REQUIRED in this document as the basis for IPv6 header compression on
   top of Bluetooth LE.  All headers MUST be compressed according to RFC
   6282 [RFC6282] encoding formats.

   The Bluetooth LE's star topology structure and ARO can be exploited
   in order to provide a mechanism for IID compression.  The following
   text describes the principles of IPv6 address compression on top of
   Bluetooth LE.

   The ARO option requires use of EUI-64 identifier [RFC6775].  In the
   case of Bluetooth LE, the field SHALL be filled with the 48-bit
   device address used by the Bluetooth LE node converted into 64-bit
   Modified EUI-64 format [RFC4291].

   To enable efficient header compression, the 6LBR MUST include 6LoWPAN
   Context Option (6CO) [RFC6775] for all prefixes the 6LBR advertises
   in Router Advertisements for use in stateless address
   autoconfiguration.

   When a 6LN is sending a packet to or through a 6LBR, it MUST fully
   elide the source address it has registered with ARO to the 6LBR for
   the indicated prefix.  That is, if SAC=0 and SAM=11 the 6LN MUST have
   registered the source link-local IPv6 address it is using using ARO,
   and if SAC=1 and SAM=11 the 6LN MUST have registered the source IPv6
   address with the prefix related to compression context identified
   with Context Identifier Extension.  The destination IPv6 address MUST
   be fully elided if the destination address is the same address to
   which the 6LN has succesfully registered its source IPv6 address with
   ARO (set DAC=0, DAM=11).  The destination IPv6 address MUST be fully
   or partially elided if context has been set up for the destination

   compression context has been configured for the used destination
   prefix.

   When a 6LBR is transmitting packets to 6LN, it MUST fully elide the
   source IID if the source IPv6 address is the one 6LN has used to
   register its address with ARO (set SAC=0, SAM=11), and it MUST elide
   the source prefix or address if a compression context related to the
   IPv6 source address has been set up.  The 6LBR also MUST elide the
   destination IPv6 address registered by the 6LN with ARO and thus 6LN
   can determine it based on indication of link-local prefix (DAC=0) or
   indication of other prefix (DAC=1 with Context Identifier Extension).

3.2.3.1.  Remote destination example

   When a 6LN transmits an IPv6 packet to a remote destination using
   global Unicast IPv6 addresses, if a context is defined for the 6LN's
   global IPv6 address, the 6LN has to indicate this context in the
   corresponding source fields of the compressed IPv6 header as per
   Section 3.1 of RFC 6282 [RFC6282], and has to elide the full IPv6
   source address previously registered with ARO.  For this, the 6LN
   MUST use the following settings in the IPv6 compressed header: CID=1,
   SAC=1, SAM=11.  In this case, the 6LBR can infer the elided IPv6
   source address since 1) the 6LBR has previously assigned the prefix
   to the 6LNs; and 2) the 6LBR maintains a Neighbor Cache that relates
   the Device Address and the IID the device has registered with ARO.
   If a context is defined for the IPv6 destination address, the 6LN has
   to also indicate this context in the corresponding destination fields
   of the compressed IPv6 header, and elide the prefix of or the full
   destination IPv6 address.  For this, the 6LN MUST set the DAM field
   of the compressed IPv6 header as DAM=01 (if the context covers a
   64-bit prefix) or as DAM=11 (if the context covers a full, 128-bit
   address).  CID and DAC MUST be set to CID=1 and DAC=1.  Note that
   when a context is defined for the IPv6 destination address, the 6LBR
   can infer the elided destination prefix by using the context.

   When a 6LBR receives an IPv6 packet sent by a remote node outside the
   Bluetooth LE network, and the destination of the packet is a 6LN, if
   a context is defined for the prefix of the 6LN's global IPv6 address,
   the 6LBR has to indicate this context in the corresponding
   destination fields of the compressed IPv6 header.  The 6LBR has to
   elide the IPv6 destination address of the packet before forwarding
   it, if the IPv6 destination address is inferable by the 6LN.  For
   this, the 6LBR will set the DAM field of the IPv6 compressed header
   as DAM=11.  CID and DAC needs to be set to CID=1 and DAC=1.  If a
   context is defined for the IPv6 source address, the 6LBR needs to
   indicate this context in the source fields of the compressed IPv6
   header, and elide that prefix as well.  For this, the 6LBR needs to
   set the SAM field of the IPv6 compressed header as SAM=01 (if the

   context covers a 64-bit prefix) or SAM=11 (if the context covers a
   full, 128-bit address).  CID and SAC are to be set to CID=1 and
   SAC=1.

3.2.4.  Unicast and Multicast address mapping

   The Bluetooth LE link layer does not support multicast.  Hence
   traffic is always unicast between two Bluetooth LE nodes.  Even in
   the case where a 6LBR is attached to multiple 6LNs, the 6LBR cannot
   do a multicast to all the connected 6LNs.  If the 6LBR needs to send
   a multicast packet to all its 6LNs, it has to replicate the packet
   and unicast it on each link.  However, this may not be energy-
   efficient and particular care must be taken if the master is battery-
   powered.  In the opposite direction, a 6LN always has to send packets
   to or through 6LBR.  Hence, when a 6LN needs to transmit an IPv6
   multicast packet, the 6LN will unicast the corresponding Bluetooth LE
   packet to the 6LBR.  The 6LBR will then forward the multicast packet
   to other 6LNs.  To avoid excess of unwanted multicast traffic being
   sent to 6LNs, the 6LBR SHOULD implement MLD Snooping feature
   [RFC4541].

3.3.  Internet connectivity scenarios

   In a typical scenario, the Bluetooth LE network is connected to the
   Internet as shown in the Figure 5.

                          \              ____________

         Figure 5: Bluetooth LE network connected to the Internet

   In some scenarios, the Bluetooth LE network may transiently or
   permanently be an isolated network as shown in the Figure 6.

   It is also possible to have point-to-point connection between two
   6LNs, one of which being central and another being peripheral.
   Similarly, it is possible to have point-to-point connections between
   two 6LBRs, one of which being central and another being peripheral.

   At this point in time mesh networking with Bluetooth LE is not
   specified.

   In the isolated network scenario communications between 6LN and 6LBR
   can use IPv6 link-local methodology, but for communications between
   different 6LNs, the 6LBR has to number the network with ULA prefix
   [RFC4193], and route packets between 6LNs.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   The transmission of IPv6 over Bluetooth LE links has similar
   requirements and concerns for security as for IEEE 802.15.4.
   Bluetooth LE Link Layer security considerations are covered by the
   IPSP [IPSP].

   Bluetooth LE Link Layer supports encryption and authentication by
   using the Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mechanism [RFC3610] and a
   128-bit AES block cipher.  Upper layer security mechanisms may
   exploit this functionality when it is available.  (Note: CCM does not
   consume bytes from the maximum per-packet L2CAP data size, since the
   link layer data unit has a specific field for them when they are
   used.)

   Key management in Bluetooth LE is provided by the Security Manager
   Protocol (SMP), as defined in [BTCorev4.1].
