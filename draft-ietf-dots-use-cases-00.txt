   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Currently, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation
   solutions/services are largely based upon siloed, proprietary
   communications paradigms which result in vendor/service lock-in, and
   as a side-effect make the configuration, provisioning, operation, and
   activation of these solutions a highly manual and often time-
   consuming process.  Additionally, coordination of multiple DDoS
   mitigation solutions/services simultaneously engaged in defending the
   same organization against DDoS attacks is fraught with both technical
   and process-related hurdles which greatly increase operational
   complexity and often result in suboptimal DDoS attack mitigation
   efficacy.

   The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to
   facilitate interoperability between DDoS solutions/services by
   providing a standards-based, programmatic communications mechanism
   for the invitation and termination of heterogeneous DDoS attack
   mitigation systems and services.  This allows for a much higher
   degree of automation and concomitant efficacy and rapidity of DDoS
   attack mitigation involving multiple DDoS mitigation systems and
   services than is currently the norm, as well as providing additional
   benefits such as automatic DDoS mitigation service registration and
   provisioning.

   This document provides an overview of common DDoS mitigation system/
   service deployment and operational models which are in use today, but
   which are currently limited in scope to a single vendor and/or
   service provider and are often highly manual in nature, which can
   lead to miscommunications, misconfigurations, and delays in bringing
   mitigation services to bear against an attack.  The introduction of
   DOTS into these scenarios will reduce reaction times and the risks
   associated with manual processes, simplify the use of multiple types
   of DDoS mitigation systems and services as required, and make
   practical the simultaneous use multiple DDoS mitigation systems and
   services as circumstances warrant.

3.  Terminology and Acronyms

   This document makes use of the same terminology and definitions as
   [I-D.draft-ietf-dots-requirements], except where noted below:

   - DDoS:   A distributed denial-of-service attack.  DDoS attacks are
         intended to cause a negative impact on the availability of
         servers, services, applications, and/or other functionality of
         an attack target.

   - Attack target:   The intended target of a DDoS attack.

   - Attack telemetry:   Collected network traffic characteristics
         enabling the detection, classification, and in many cases
         traceback of a DDoS attack.

   - Mitigation:   A defensive response against a detected DDoS attack,
         performed by an entity in the network path between attack
         sources and the attack target, either through inline deployment
         or some form of traffic diversion, consisting of one or more
         countermeasures.  The form a given mitigation takes is out of
         scope for this document.

   - Countermeasure:   An action or set of actions taken by a mitigator
         to evaluate and filter out a significant proportion of DDoS
         attack traffic while forwarding onwards a significant
         proportion of legitimate traffic directed towards an attack
         target.

4.  Use Cases

   This section provides a high-level overview of likely use cases and
   deployment scenarios for DOTS-enabled DDoS mitigation services.  It
   should be noted that DOTS servers may be standalone entities which,
   upon receiving a DOTS mitigation service request from a DOTS client,
   then initiate DDoS mitigation service by communicating directly or
   indirectly with DDoS mitigators, and likewise terminate the service
   upon receipt of a DOTS service termination request; conversely, the
   DDoS mitigators themselves may incorporate DOTS servers and/or DOTS
   clients.  The mechanisms by which DOTS servers initiate and terminate
   DDoS mitigation service with DDoS mitigators is beyond the scope of
   this document.

   All of the primary use cases described in this section are derived
   from current, real-world DDoS mitigation functionality, capabilities,
   and operational models which have been implemented in a largely
   proprietary manner by various DDoS mitigation solution vendor and/or
   service providers, resulting in vendor/service lock-in and mutually

Internet-Draft               DOTS Use cases                 October 2015


   incompatible solutions/services.  The overarching goal of the DOTS
   effort is to provide a standards-based mechanism to allow
   heterogeneous DDoS mitigation solutions and services to be woven
   together in order to allow broader, more pervasive adoption of
   coordinated DDoS defense.

   The posited ancillary use cases described in this section are
   reasonable and highly desirable extrapolations of the functionality
   of baseline DOTS capabilities, and are readily attainable in the near
   term.

   Another important goal of DOTS is interoperability and coordination
   via a common standards-based mechanism between multiple DDoS
   mitigation service providers contemporaneously engaged in defending
   the same organization against DDoS attacks.  Each of the primary and
   ancillary use cases described in this section may be read as
   involving one or more DDoS mitigation service providers; DOTS makes
   multi-provider coordinated DDoS defenses much more effective and
   practical due to abstraction of the particulars of a given DDoS
   mitigation service/solution set.

   Both the primary and ancillary use cases may be facilitated by direct
   DOTS client - DOTS server communications or via DOTS relays deployed
   in order to aggregate DOTS mitigation service requests/responses, to
   mediate between stateless and stateful underlying transport
   protocols, to aggregate multiple DOTS requests and/or responses, to
   filter DOTS requests and/or responses via configured policy
   mechanisms, or some combination of these functions.

   These use cases requirements are intended to inform the DOTS
   requirements described in [I-D.draft-ietf-dots-requirements].

4.1.  Primary Use Cases

4.1.1.  Successful Automatic or Operator-Assisted CPE or PE Mitigators
        Request Upstream DDoS Mitigation Services

   In this scenario, one or more CPE or PE mitigators with DOTS client
   capabilities may be configured to signal to one or more DOTS servers
   in order to request upstream DDoS mitigation service initiation
   during an attack when DDoS attack volumes and/or attack
   characteristics exceed the capabilities of such CPE mitigators.  DDoS
   mitigation service may be terminated either automatically or manually
   via a DOTS mitigation service termination request initiated by the
   mitigator when it has been determined that the DDoS attack has ended.

   All DOTS messages exchanged between the DOTS clients and DOTS servers
   in this use case may be communicated directly between the DOTS

   clients and servers, or mediated by one or more DOTS relays residing
   on the network of the originating network, the network where upstream
   DDoS mitigation service takes place, an intervening network or
   networks, or some combination of the above.

   (a)  A DDoS attack is initiated against online properties of an
        organization which has deployed DOTS-client-capable DDoS
        mitigators.

   (b)  CPE or PE DDoS mitigators detect, classify, and begin mitigating
        the DDoS attack.

   (c)  CPE or PE DDoS mitigators determine that their capacity and/or
        capability to mitigate the DDoS attack is insufficient, and
        utilize their DOTS client functionality to send a DOTS
        mitigation service initiation request to one or more DOTS
        servers residing on one or more upstream transit networks, peer
        networks, or overlay MSSP networks.  The scope, format, and
        content of these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.  This
        DOTS mitigation service initiation request may be automatically
        initiated by the CPE or PE DDoS mitigators, or may be manually
        triggered by personnel of the requesting organization in
        response to an alert from the mitigators (the mechanism by which
        this process takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (d)  The DOTS servers which receive the DOTS mitigation service
        initiation requests determine that they have been to honor
        requests from the requesting CPE or PE mitigators, and initiate
        situationally-appropriate DDoS mitigation service on their
        respective networks (the mechanism by which this process takes
        place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (e)  The DOTS servers transmit a DOTS service status message to the
        requesting CPE or PE mitigators indicating that upstream DDoS
        mitigation service has been initiated.

   (f)  While DDoS mitigation services are active, the DOTS servers
        regularly transmit DOTS mitigation status updates to the
        requesting CPE or PE mitigators.  The scope, format, and content
        of these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.

   (g)  While DDoS mitigation services are active, the CPE or PE
        mitigators may optionally regularly transmit DOTS mitigation
        efficacy updates to the relevant DOTS servers.  The scope,
        format, and content of these messages must be codified by the
        DOTS WG.

   (h)  When the upstream DDoS mitigators determine that the DDoS attack
        has ceased, they indicate this change in status to their
        respective DOTS servers (the mechanism by which this process
        takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (i)  The DOTS servers transmit a DOTS mitigation status update to the
        CPE or PE mitigators indicating that the DDoS attack has ceased.
        The scope, format, and content of these messages must be
        codified by the DOTS WG.

   (j)  The CPE or PE DDoS mitigators transmit a DOTS mitigation service
        termination request to the DOTS servers.  [The scope, format,
        and content of these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.]
        This DOTS mitigation service termination request may be
        automatically initiated by the CPE or PE DDoS mitigators, or may
        be manually triggered by personnel of the requesting
        organization in response to an alert from the mitigators or a
        management system which monitors them (the mechanism by which
        this process takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (k)  The DOTS servers terminate DDoS mitigation service on their
        respective networks (the mechanism by which this process takes
        place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (l)  The DOTS servers transmit a DOTS mitigation status update to the
        CPE or PE mitigators indicating that DDoS mitigation services
        have been terminated.  The scope, format, and content of these
        messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.

   (m)  The CPE or PE DDoS mitigators transmit a DOTS mitigation
        termination status acknowledgement to the DOTS servers.  [The
        scope, format, and content of these messages must be codified by
        the DOTS WG.]

4.1.2.  Successful Automatic or Operator-Assisted CPE or PE Network
        Infrastructure Element Request to Upstream Mitigator

   In this scenario, CPE or PE network infrastructure elements such as
   routers, switches, load-balancers, firewalls, 'IPSes', etc. which
   have the capability to detect and classify DDoS attacks and which
   have DOTS client capabilities may be configured to signal to one or
   more DOTS servers in order to request upstream DDoS mitigation
   service initiation during an attack.  DDoS mitigation service may be
   terminated either automatically or manually via a DOTS mitigation
   service termination request initiated by the network element when it
   has been determined that the DDoS attack has ended.

   All DOTS messages exchanged between the DOTS clients and DOTS servers
   in this use case may be communicated directly between the DOTS
   clients and servers, or mediated by one or more DOTS relays residing
   on the network of the originating network, the network where upstream
   DDoS mitigation service takes place, an intervening network or
   networks, or some combination of the above.

   (a)  A DDoS attack is initiated against online properties of an
        organization with DOTS-client-capable network infrastructure
        elements deployed.

   (b)  The network infrastructure elements utilize their DOTS client
        functionality to send a DOTS mitigation service initiation
        request to one or more DOTS servers residing on one or more
        upstream transit networks, peer networks, or overlay MSSP
        networks, either directly or via intermediate DOTS relays
        residing upon the requesting organization's network, the
        upstream mitigation provider's network, or both.  The scope,
        format, and content of these messages must be codified by the
        DOTS WG.  This DOTS mitigation service initiation request may be
        automatically initiated by the network infrastructure elements,
        or may be manually triggered by personnel of the requesting
        organization in response to an alert from the network elements
        or a management system which monitors them (the mechanism by
        which this process takes place is beyond the scope of this
        document).

   (c)  The DOTS servers which receive the DOTS mitigation service
        initiation requests determine that they have been to honor
        requests from the requesting network infrastructure elements,
        and initiate situationally-appropriate DDoS mitigation service
        on their respective networks (the mechanism by which this
        process takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (d)  The DOTS servers transmit a DOTS service status message to the
        requesting network infrastructure elements indicating that
        upstream DDoS mitigation service has been initiated.  The scope,
        format, and content of these messages must be codified by the
        DOTS WG.

   (e)  While DDoS mitigation services are active, the DOTS servers
        regularly transmit DOTS mitigation status updates to the
        requesting requesting network infrastructure elements.  The
        scope, format, and content of these messages must be codified by
        the DOTS WG.

   (f)  While DDoS mitigation services are active, the network
        infrastructure elements may optionally regularly transmit DOTS

        scope, format, and content of these messages must be codified by
        the DOTS WG.

   (g)  When the upstream DDoS mitigators determine that the DDoS attack
        has ceased, they indicate this change in status to their
        respective DOTS servers (the mechanism by which this process
        takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (h)  The DOTS servers transmit a DOTS mitigation status update to the
        network infrastructure elements indicating that the DDoS attack
        has ceased.  The scope, format, and content of these messages
        must be codified by the DOTS WG.

   (i)  The network infrastructure elements transmit a DOTS mitigation
        service termination request to the DOTS servers.  The scope,
        format, and content of these messages must be codified by the
        DOTS WG.  This DOTS mitigation service termination request may
        be automatically initiated by the network infrastructure
        elements, or may be manually triggered by personnel of the
        requesting organization in response to an alert from the
        mitigators (the mechanism by which this process takes place is
        beyond the scope of this document).

   (j)  The DOTS servers terminate DDoS mitigation service on their
        respective networks (the mechanism by which this process takes

4.1.3.  Successful Automatic or Operator-Assisted CPE or PE Attack
        Telemetry Detection/Classification System Request to Upstream
        Mitigator

   In this scenario, CPE or PE Attack Telemetry Detection/Classification
   Systems which have DOTS client capabilities may be configured so that
   upon detecting and classifying a DDoS attack, they signal one or more
   DOTS servers in order to request upstream DDoS mitigation service

        servers residing on one or more upstream transit networks, peer
        networks, or overlay MSSP networks, either directly or via
        intermediate DOTS relays residing upon the requesting

        service initiation request may be automatically initiated by the
        CPE or PE Attack Telemetry Detection/Classification Systems, or
        may be manually triggered by personnel of the requesting
        organization in response to an alert from the CPE or PE Attack
        Telemetry Detection/Classification Systems (the mechanism by
        which this process takes place is beyond the scope of this

4.1.4.  Successful Automatic or Operator-Assisted Targeted Service/
        Application Request to Upstream Mitigator

   In this scenario, a service or application which is the target of a
   DDoS attack and which has the capability to detect and classify DDoS
   attacks (i.e, Apache mod_security [APACHE], BIND RRL [RRL], etc.) as
   well as DOTS client functionality may be configured so that upon
   detecting and classifying a DDoS attack, it signals one or more DOTS
   servers in order to request upstream DDoS mitigation service
   initiation.  DDoS mitigation service may be terminated either
   automatically or manually via a DOTS mitigation service termination
   request initiated by the service/application when it has been
   determined that the DDoS attack has ended.

   All DOTS messages exchanged between the DOTS clients and DOTS servers
   in this use case may be communicated directly between the DOTS
   clients and servers, or mediated by one or more DOTS relays residing
   on the network of the originating network, the network where upstream
   DDoS mitigation service takes place, an intervening network or
   networks, or some combination of the above.

   (a)  A DDoS attack is initiated against online properties of an
        organization which include DOTS-client-capable services or
        applications that are the specific target(s) of the attack.

   (b)  The targeted services or applications utilize their DOTS client
        functionality to send a DOTS mitigation service initiation
        request to one or more DOTS servers residing on the same network
        as the services or applications, one or more upstream transit
        networks, peer networks, or overlay MSSP networks, either
        directly or via intermediate DOTS relays residing upon the
        requesting organization's network, the upstream mitigation
        provider's network, or both.  The scope, format, and content of
        these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.  This DOTS
        mitigation service initiation request may be automatically
        initiated by the targeted services or applications, or may be
        manually triggered by personnel of the requesting organization
        in response to an alert from the targeted services or
        applications or a system which monitors them (the mechanism by
        which this process takes place is beyond the scope of this
        document).

   (c)  The DOTS servers which receive the DOTS mitigation service
        initiation requests determine that they have been provisioned to
        honor requests from the requesting services or applications, and
        initiate situationally-appropriate DDoS mitigation service on
        their respective networks (the mechanism by which this process
        takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

        services or applications indicating that upstream DDoS
        mitigation service has been initiated.  [The scope, format, and
        content of these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.

   (e)  While DDoS mitigation services are active, the DOTS servers

        requesting services or applications.  The scope, format, and
        content of these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.

   (f)  While DDoS mitigation services are active, the requesting
        services or applications may optionally regularly transmit DOTS
        mitigation efficacy updates to the relevant DOTS servers.  The

        service termination request to the DOTS servers.  [The scope,
        format, and content of these messages must be codified by the
        DOTS WG.]  This DOTS mitigation service termination request may
        be automatically initiated by the targeted services or

        requesting organization in response to an alert from a system
        which monitors them (the mechanism by which this process takes
        place is beyond the scope of this document).

        the DOTS WG.

4.1.5.  Successful Manual Web Portal Request to Upstream Mitigator

   In this scenario, a Web portal which has DOTS client capabilities has
   been configured in order to allow authorized personnel of
   organizations which are targeted by DDoS attacks to manually request
   upstream DDoS mitigation service initiation from a DOTS server.  When
   an organization has reason to believe that it is under active attack,
   authorized personnel may utilize the Web portal to manually initiate
   a DOTS client mitigation request to one or more DOTS servers.  DDoS
   mitigation service may be terminated manually via a DOTS mitigation
   service termination request through the Web portal when it has been
   determined that the DDoS attack has ended.

   All DOTS messages exchanged between the DOTS client and DOTS servers
   in this use case may be communicated directly between the DOTS client
   and servers, or mediated by one or more DOTS relays residing on the
   network of the originating network, the network where upstream DDoS
   mitigation service takes place, an intervening network or networks,
   or some combination of the above.

   (a)  A DDoS attack is initiated against online properties of an
        organization have access to a Web portal which incorporates DOTS
        client functionality and can generate DOTS mitigation service
        requests upon demand.

   (b)  Authorized personnel utilize the Web portal to send a DOTS
        mitigation service initiation request to one or more upstream
        transit networks, peer networks, or overlay MSSP networks,
        either directly or via intermediate DOTS relays residing upon
        the requesting organization's network, the upstream mitigation
        provider's network, or both.  [The scope, format, and content of
        these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.]  This DOTS
        mitigation service initiation request is manually triggered by
        personnel of the requesting organization when it is judged that
        the organization is under DDoS attack (the mechanism by which
        this process takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (c)  The DOTS servers which receive the DOTS mitigation service
        initiation requests determine that they have been provisioned to
        honor requests from the Web portal, and initiate situationally-
        appropriate DDoS mitigation service on their respective networks
        (the mechanism by which this process takes place is beyond the
        scope of this document).

4.1.6.  Successful Manual Mobile Device Application Request to Upstream
        Mitigator

   In this scenario, an application for mobile devices such as
   smartphones and tablets which incorporates DOTS client capabilities
   has been made available to authorized personnel of an organization.
   When the organization has reason to believe that it is under active
   DDoS attack, authorized personnel may utilize the mobile device
   application to manually initiate a DOTS client mitigation request to
   one or more DOTS servers in order to initiate upstream DDoS
   mitigation services.  DDoS mitigation service may be terminated
   manually via a DOTS mitigation service termination request initiated
   through the mobile device application when it has been determined
   that the DDoS attack has ended.

   All DOTS messages exchanged between the DOTS client and DOTS servers
   in this use case may be communicated directly between the DOTS client
   and servers, or mediated by one or more DOTS relays residing on the
   network of the originating network, the network where upstream DDoS
   mitigation service takes place, an intervening network or networks,
   or some combination of the above.

   (a)  A DDoS attack is initiated against online properties of an
        organization have access to a Web portal which incorporates DOTS
        client functionality and can generate DOTS mitigation service
        requests upon demand.

   (b)  Authorized personnel utilize the mobile application to send a
        DOTS mitigation service initiation request to one or more DOTS
        servers residing on the same network as the targeted Internet
        properties, one or more upstream transit networks, peer
        networks, or overlay MSSP networks, either directly or via
        intermediate DOTS relays residing upon the requesting
        organization's network, the upstream mitigation provider's
        network, or both.  [The scope, format, and content of these
        messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.]  This DOTS mitigation
        service initiation request is manually triggered by personnel of

        organization is under DDoS attack (the mechanism by which this
        process takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (c)  The DOTS servers which receive the DOTS mitigation service
        initiation requests determine that they have been provisioned to
        honor requests from the mobile application, and initiate
        situationally-appropriate DDoS mitigation service on their
        respective networks (the mechanism by which this process takes
        place is beyond the scope of this document).

4.1.7.  Unsuccessful Automatic or Operator-Assisted CPE or PE Mitigators
        Request Upstream DDoS Mitigation Services

   In this scenario, one or more CPE or PE mitigators with DOTS client
   capabilities may be configured to signal to one or more DOTS servers
   in order to request upstream DDoS mitigation service initiation
   during an attack when DDoS attack volumes and/or attack
   characteristics exceed the capabilities of such CPE mitigators.  DDoS
   mitigation service may be terminated either automatically or manually
   via a DOTS mitigation service termination request initiated by the
   mitigator when it has been determined that the DDoS attack has ended.

   All DOTS messages exchanged between the DOTS clients and DOTS servers
   in this use case may be communicated directly between the DOTS
   clients and servers, or mediated by one or more DOTS relays residing
   on the network of the originating network, the network where upstream
   DDoS mitigation service takes place, an intervening network or
   networks, or some combination of the above.

   (a)  A DDoS attack is initiated against online properties of an
        organization which has deployed DOTS-client-capable DDoS
        mitigators.

   (b)  CPE or PE DDoS mitigators detect, classify, and begin mitigating
        the DDoS attack.

   (c)  CPE or PE DDoS mitigators determine that their capacity and/or
        capability to mitigate the DDoS attack is insufficient, and
        utilize their DOTS client functionality to send a DOTS
        mitigation service initiation request to one or more DOTS
        servers residing on one or more upstream transit networks, peer
        networks, or overlay MSSP networks.  The scope, format, and
        content of these messages must be codified by the DOTS WG.]
        This DOTS mitigation service initiation request may be
        automatically initiated by the CPE or PE DDoS mitigators, or may
        be manually triggered by personnel of the requesting
        organization in response to an alert from the mitigators (the
        mechanism by which this process takes place is beyond the scope
        of this document).

   (d)  The DOTS servers which receive the DOTS mitigation service
        initiation requests determine that they have been to honor
        requests from the requesting CPE or PE mitigators, and attempt
        to initiate situationally-appropriate DDoS mitigation service on
        their respective networks (the mechanism by which this process
        takes place is beyond the scope of this document).

   (e)  The DDoS mitigators on the upstream network report back to the
        DOTS servers that they are unable to initiate DDoS mitigation
        service for the requesting organization due to mitigation
        capacity constraints, bandwidth constraints, functionality
        constraints, hardware casualties, or other impediments (the
        mechanism by which this process takes place is beyond the scope
        of this document).

   (f)  The DOTS servers transmit a DOTS service status message to the
        requesting CPE or PE mitigators indicating that upstream DDoS
        mitigation service cannot be initiated as requested.  The scope,
        format, and content of these messages must be codified by the
        DOTS WG.

   (g)  The CPE or PE mitigators may optionally regularly re-transmit
        DOTS mitigation status request messages to the relevant DOTS
        servers until acknowledgement that mitigation services have been
        initiated.  The scope, format, and content of these messages
        must be codified by the DOTS WG.

   (h)  The CPE or PE mitigators may optionally transmit a DOTS
        mitigation service initiation request to DOTS servers associated
        with a configured fallback upstream DDoS mitigation service.
        The scope, format, and content of these messages must be
        codified by the DOTS WG.  Multiple fallback DDoS mitigation
        services may optionally be configured.

   (i)  The process describe above cyclically continues until the DDoS
        mitigation service request is fulfilled; the CPE or PE
        mitigators determine that the DDoS attack volume has decreased
        to a level and/or complexity which they themselves can
        successfully mitigate; the DDoS attack has ceased; or manual
        intervention by personnel of the requesting organization has
        taken place.

4.2.  Ancillary Use Cases

4.2.1.  Auto-registration of DOTS clients with DOTS servers

   An additional benefit of DOTS is that by utilizing agreed-upon
   authentication mechanisms, DOTS clients can automatically register
   for DDoS mitigation service with one or more upstream DOTS servers.

4.2.2.  Auto-provisioning of DDoS countermeasures

   The largely manual tasks associated with provisioning effective,
   situationally-appropriate DDoS countermeasures is a significant
   barrier to providing/obtaining DDoS mitigation services for both
   mitigation providers and mitigation recipients.  Due to the 'self-
   descriptive' nature of DOTS registration messages and mitigation
   requests, the implementation and deployment of DOTS has the potential
   to automate countermeasure selection and configuration for DDoS
   mitigators.  The details of such provisioning are beyond the scope of
   this document.

4.2.3.  Informational DDoS attack notification to interested and
        authorized third parties

   In addition to its primary role of providing a standardized,
   programmatic approach to the automated and/or operator-assisted
   request of DDoS mitigation services and providing status updates of
   those mitigations to requesters, DOTS may be utilized to notify
   security researchers, law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies,
   etc. of DDoS attacks against attack targets, assuming that
   organizations making use of DOTS choose to share such third-party
   notifications, in keeping with all applicable laws, regulations,
   privacy and confidentiality considerations, and contractual
   agreements between DOTS users and said third parties.

5.  Security Considerations

   DOTS is at risk from three primary attacks: DOTS agent impersonation,
   traffic injection, and signaling blocking.  The DOTS protocol MUST be
   designed for minimal data transfer to address the blocking risk.

   Impersonation and traffic injection mitigation can be managed through
   current secure communications best practices.  DOTS is not subject to
   anything new in this area.  One consideration could be to minimize
   the security technologies in use at any one time.  The more needed,
   the greater the risk of failures coming from assumptions on one
   technology providing protection that it does not in the presence of
   another technology.

6.  IANA Considerations
