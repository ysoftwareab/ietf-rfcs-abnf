Status of This Memo

   This document is a submission by the Service Location Working Group
   of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  Comments should be

   This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
   and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at

Abstract

   This document defined the service:lpr scheme and attributes
   associated with it.  This template is designed to be used in
   conjuction with the Service Location Protocol [1], but may be
   used with any directory service supporting attribute/value pair
   registration.

1. lpr service: URL Scheme

   Service Type templates are used to describe in a standard way those
   services which use the service: URL. The template described in this
   document is for the printing protocol defined in RFC 1179 [2], ``Line
   Printer Daemon Protocol''.  The service type for this service: URL is
   lpr.


2. urlpath Definition

   The URL has service specific information that specifies protocol used
   to access the printer, and the name of the print queue.  The syntax
   for the urlpath for specifying this is:

      qname    = 1*[ DIGIT / ALPHA ]
      urlpath  = "/" qname


   A null value the qname assumes the default value, as defined by the
   print server.

3. Printer Scheme Background

   The printer scheme provides for consistent registration of printer
   services.  The attributes described within this draft are a
   combination of previous works conducted by the IETF Printer MIB WG,
   the IETF IPP WG and the Salutation Consortium.

   The attributes specified are intended to facilitate both automatic
   as well as manual selection of services not to provide service
   statistics or notification.  In short, the target audience of service
   attributes are users, either programatic or end users, where the
   audience of MIB statistics are network managers.

4. lpr Service Template

   The lpr template, as defined below, conforms to the grammar described
   in ``Service Templates and service:  Schemes''.  Please refer to [2]
   for detailed explaination of the syntax.

        type = lpr

        description =
            The lpr service template describes the attributes supported by
            network printing devices that support RFC 1179.  These
            devices may be either directly connected to a network, or
            connected to a printer spooler that understands the protocol
            described in RFC 1179.

        url-syntax =
            qname = 1*[ DIGIT / ALPHA ]

            # by this Printer object.  The syntax shall be:
            # vendor-name "/" model-name
            # where the vendor-name is the same as that registered with
            # IANA for use in domain names.
            # For example:  "vendor-x/super-duper-printer".

        location-description = STRING
