Internet-Draft         NFS Direct Data Placement                May 2003


Abstract

   The RDMA transport for ONC RPC supports direct data placement for NFS
   data.  Direct data placement not only reduces the amount of data that
   needs to be copied in an NFS call, but allows much of the data
   movement over the network to be implemented in RDMA hardware. This
   draft describes the use of direct data placement by means of server-
   initiated RDMA Writes into client-supplied buffers in a Write list
   for implementations of NFS versions 2, 3, and 4 over an RDMA
   transport.


1.  Introduction

   The RDMA Transport for ONC RPC [RPCRDMA] allows an RPC client
   application to post buffers in a Write list that accept specific
   results from an RPC call.  The RDMA transport header conveys this
   list of client buffer addresses to the server where the application
   can associate them with result data and use RDMA Write to transfer
   the results directly into the posted buffers on the client.  The
   client and server must agree on a consistent mapping of posted reply
   buffers to RPC results.  This document details the mapping for each
   version of the NFS protocol.


2.  RDMA Write List

   The RDMA Write list, in the RDMA transport header, allows the client
   to post one or more buffers into which the server will RDMA Write
   designated result chunks directly.  If the client sends a null write
   list, then results from the RPC call will be returned as either an
   in-line reply, as chunks in an RDMA Read list of server-posted
   buffers, or in a client-posted reply buffer.

   Each posted buffer in a Write list is represented as an array of
   memory segments. This allows the client some flexibility in
   submitting discontiguous memory segments into which the server will
   scatter the result.  Each segment is described by a triplet
   consisting of the segment handle or steering tag (STag), segment
   length, and memory address or offset.

      struct xdr_rdma_segment {
         uint32 handle;    /* Registered memory handle */
         uint32 length;    /* Length of the chunk in bytes */
         uint64 offset;    /* Chunk virtual address or offset */
      };

      struct xdr_write_chunk {
         struct xdr_rdma_segment target<>;
      };

      struct xdr_write_list {
         struct xdr_write_chunk entry;
         struct xdr_write_list  *next;
      };

   The sum of the segment lengths yields the total size of the buffer,
   which must be large enough to accept the result.  If the buffer is
   too small the server must return an XDR encode error.  The server
   must return the result data for a posted buffer by progressively
   filling its segments, perhaps leaving some trailing segments unfilled
   or partially full if the size of the result is less than the total
   size of the buffer segments.

   The server returns the RDMA Write list to the client with the segment
   length fields overwritten to indicate the amount of data RDMA Written
   to each segment. Results returned by direct placement must not be
   returned by other methods, e.g.  by read chunk list or in-line.

   The RDMA Write list allows the client to provide multiple result
   buffers - each buffer must map to a specific result in the reply. The
   NFS client and server implementations must agree on the mapping of
   results to buffers for each RPC procedure. The following sections
   describe this mapping for versions of the NFS protocol.


3.  NFS Versions 2 and 3 Mapping

   A single RDMA write list entry may be posted by the client to receive
   either the opaque file data from a READ request or the pathname from
   a READLINK request.  The server will ignore a Write list for any
   other NFS procedure, as well as any Write list entries beyond the
   first in the list.


4.  NFS Version 4 Mapping

   This specification applies to the first minor version of NFS version
   4 (NFSv4.0) and any subsequent minor versions that do not override
   this mapping.

   The Write list will be considered only for the COMPOUND procedure.
   This procedure returns results from a sequence of operations.
   Designated operations consume entries from the Write chunk list.  The
   first entry in the Write chunk list must be used by the first

   designated operation in the compound procedure.  If the Write chunk
   list is consumed before all designated operations are evaluated,
   remaining results will be returned in-line or by Read chunk list as
   appropriate.  If a Write chunk list entry is presented, then a
   designated operation must use it to return its result data.  However,
   Write list chunk with a zero length buffer indicates that the
   corresponding designated operation is to return its result in-line or
   by Read chunk list.

   The designated operations and their results are the opaque file data
   from the READ operation, and the pathname from the READLINK
   operation.

   The following example shows an RDMA Write list with three posted
   buffers A, B, and C.  The designated operations in the compound
   request, READ and READLINK, consume the posted buffers by writing
   their results back to each buffer.

      RDMA Write list:

         A --> B --> C

      Compound request:

         PUTFH LOOKUP READ PUTFH LOOKUP READLINK PUTFH LOOKUP READ
                       |                   |                   |
                       v                   v                   v
                       A                   B                   C

   If the client does not want to have the READLINK result returned
   directly, then it sets the values in the segment triplet for buffer B
   to zeros so that the READLINK result will be returned in-line.


5.  Security

   The RDMA transport for ONC RPC supports RPCSEC_GSS security as well
   as link-level security.  The use of RDMA Write to return RPC results
   does not affect ONC RPC security.


6.  IANA Considerations

   NFS use of direct data placement introduces no new IANA
   considerations.
