Abstract 

   This document defines generalized procedures that allow BGP speakers 
   to exchange Route Target reachability information. This information 
   can be used to precisely control the propagation of different kinds 
   of Virtual Private Network (VPN) routing information. This method 
   avoids unnecessary advertising of VPN routes when more than one kind 
   of VPN service is deployed in the network. This document also 
   provides a solution to ensure the RT-Constrain mechanism compatible 
   with IPv6 address specific Route Target defined in [RFC5701].

1. Introduction 

   BGP [RFC4271] has been widely used in many kinds of Virtual Private 
   Networks (VPNs) for exchanging routes and auto discovery information.

   Route Target (RT) extended communities defined in [RFC4360] are used 
   to control the distribution of received information into VPN 
   instances.  

   [RFC4684] defines some procedures to restrict the distribution of VPN 
   routes. It defines a new MP-BGP NLRI with [AFI=1, SAFI=132] for 
   carrying RT membership information, which can be used to control the 
   propagation of VPN routes. The procedures are helpful in limiting the 
   propagation of VPN routes in networks where only one kind of VPN is 
   deployed. If multiple different kinds of VPN services are deployed in 
   the network, the procedures in RFC 4684 are not sufficient for 
   providing precise control of VPN route distribution. In addition, the 
   format of RT membership NLRI defined is not compatible with IPv6 
   address specific Route Target which is defined in [RFC5701]. 

   This document describes the use of RT for VPNs, analyses possible 
   problems RFC 4684 may meet with and provides solutions for these 
   problems.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Use of Route Target 

   The Route Target (RT) extended communities defined in [RFC4360] is 
   used for controlling the distribution of VPN routes. The use of RT in 
   each kind of VPN has been specified respectively in [RFC4364], 
   [RFC4659], [RFC4761], [RFC5195], [MVPN-BGP], [L2VPN-BGP], [VPLS-
   MCAST], [L2VPN-SIG] and [VPMS-BGP]. The Appendix section extracts the 
   specifications about RT in these RFCs and drafts. 

   Currently there is no specification on RT assignment among different 
   kinds of VPNs. Based on the procedures of BGP based VPN, different 
   kinds of VPNs are isolated using different AFI/SAFI, which allows the 
   RT assignment in different kinds of VPNs be performed independently, 
   i.e. the RT assignment in one kind of VPN has no impact on the RT 
   assignment and route distribution of another kind of VPN.  

   In some scenarios such as network migration and deployment of new VPN 
   services, in order to reduce manual configuration and the complexity 
   in network management, operators MAY prefer to use the same RT for 
   different kinds of VPN services. One case is to use the same RT for 
   IPv4 and IPv6 VPN. 

4. Problems of Route Constraint in Multiple Kinds of VPNs 

   Service Provider (SP) may deploy more than one kind of VPNs in the 
   same network. For example, SPs may deploy both IPv4/IPv6 L3VPNs, or 
   both L3VPN and L2VPN, or both unicast VPN and multicast VPN, or even 
   more than 2 kinds of VPN services coexisted in their network. It is 
   reasonable for SPs to design, deploy and maintain these different VPN 
   services independently. Thus the RT assignment in different VPN 
   services should be performed independently. In addition, in the 
   scenarios of inter-provider VPNs, it would be a complicated task to 
   coordinate the RT assignment in different kinds of VPN services 
   between different service providers. This burden can be relieved by 
   allocating RTs independently for different kinds of VPN services. In 
   this case, the same RT may be used by different kinds of VPNs. 

   The procedures of RFC 4684 cannot work accurately in networks with 
   multiple kinds of VPNs. The RT membership NLRI used for controlling

Internet-Draft      BGP Based VPN Route Constrain            July 2010 
    

   the distribution of VPN routes cannot tell which kind of VPN route is 
   requested. Thus in some scenarios, the mechanism in RFC 4684 is not 
   sufficient to provide precise control for VPN route distribution, and 
   some PEs may receive undesired VPN routes. Detailed analyses are 
   given in sections below. 

4.1. IPv4 L3VPN and IPv6 L3VPN 

   Some service providers need to deploy both IPv4 L3VPN (VPNv4) and 
   IPv6 L3VPN (VPNv6) in their network. During the migration from IPv4 
   to IPv6, for less manual configuration and management simplicity the 
   RTs used for VPNv6 can be the same as the ones for VPNv4. However, 
   it's likely that not all the VPN sites are both IPv4 and IPv6 capable, 
   some of them may be only IPv4 capable, some other ones may support 
   both IPv4 and IPv6, and the others may only recognize IPv6 packets.  

   In Figure 1, suppose the VPN site of VPN-1 connected to PE-1 is only 
   IPv4 capable, the sites of VPN-1 connected to PE-2 and PE-3 are IPv6 
   capable. Using procedures of RFC 4684, PE-1 advertises the RT 
   membership information containing RT-1 to the other PEs. According to 
   the received RT membership information, PE-2 and PE-3 will advertise 
   VPNv6 routes of VPN-1 to PE-1. As a result, PE-1 will receive 
   undesired VPNv6 routes of VPN-1. Similarly, PE-1 will receive 
   undesired VPNv4 routes of VPN-2, PE-3 will receive undesired VPNv4 
   routes of VPN-1.

   Even if RTs allocated for VPNv6 are different from the ones used for 
   VPNv4 on each PE, if there is some overlapping between the RT space 
   of VPNv4 and VPNv6 in the network, some PEs may also receive 
   undesired VPN routes of other VPNs. 

4.2. L3VPN and L2VPN  

   The mechanisms defined in RFC 4684 are claimed to be applicable for 
   L2VPNs which use Route Targets to control distribution of routing 
   information. However, if both L3VPN and L2VPN are deployed in the 
   same network, the mechanisms defined in RFC 4684 are not sufficient 
   to achieve accurate control of route distribution.  

   If there is some overlapping between the RTs used in L3VPNs and 
   L2VPNs in the network, PEs may receive undesired VPN routes of 
   another kind of VPN service. 

   For example, in Figure 2, RT-1 is used by PE-1 and PE-4 for L2VPN-1, 
   and is also used by PE-2 and PE-3 for L3VPN-3. If PE-1 and PE-4 
   advertise RT membership information of RT-1 to other PEs in the

   network, subsequently PE-2 and PE-3 would advertise undesired L3VPN 
   routes to PE-1 and PE-4.

4.3. Unicast VPN and Multicast VPN 

   Multicast L3VPN [MVPN, MVPN-BGP] and VPLS multicast [VPLS-MCAST] have 
   defined new SAFIs for exchanging multicast routing information, and 
   RTs are used in these scenarios to control distribution of multiple 
   types of multicast routing information.  

   Since MVPN is deployed on the basis of unicast VPN, they are always 
   coexistent in the same network.  

   As [MVPN-BGP] says, by default the distribution of Intra-AS I-PMSI A-
   D route is controlled by the same Route Targets as the ones used for 
   the distribution of VPN-IP unicast routes. Thus PE advertising RT 
   membership NLRI may receive undesired routing information, i.e., PE 
   wants to receive only unicast VPN routes corresponding to the RT may 
   also receive undesired multicast routing information.

   In Figure 3, suppose the site of VPN-1 connected to PE-1 only support 
   IP unicast, the sites of VPN-1 connected to PE-2 and PE-3 support IP 
   multicast. Using the mechanisms defined in [RFC4684], PE-1 will 
   advertise the RT membership information containing RT-1 to the other 
   PEs. According to the received RT membership information, PE-2 and 
   PE-3 will advertise multicast routes of VPN-1 to PE-1. As a result, 
   PE-1 will receive undesired multicast routes of VPN-1.

   Even if RTs allocated for MVPNs are different from the ones used for 
   unicast VPNs on each PE, if there is some overlapping between the RT 
   space of MVPNs and unicast VPNs in the network, some PEs may also 
   receive unwanted VPN routes of other VPNs. 

5. Considerations about IPv6 address specific Route Target  

   The format of RT membership NLRI in RFC 4684 contains a Route Target 
   field of 8 octets. However, [RFC5701] has defined IPv6 address 
   specific Route Target with the length of 20 octets, thus the format 
   of RT membership NLRI is not applicable when IPv6 address specific

Internet-Draft      BGP Based VPN Route Constrain            July 2010 
    

   Route Target is used. From this point of view, an update to the 
   format of RT-membership NLRI is necessary.  

6. Possible Solutions 

6.1. Compatibility with IPv6 address specific Route Target 

   First of all, this document proposes to change the length of Route 
   Target field in RT membership NLRI to "variable". Thus the NLRI 
   format is compatible with IPv6 address specific Route Target and 
   other potential types of Route Targets which can be defined in future. 
   Since the RT membership NLRI is encoded as defined in section 4 of 
   RFC 2858 (which is obsoleted by [RFC4760]), thus the length field in 
   RT membership NLRI can be used to calculate the length of Route 
   Target.  

6.2. Identifying RT Membership in Multiple Kinds of VPNs 

6.2.1. Unique RT Assignment 

   One straightforward solution to avoid receiving undesired VPN routes 
   with the use of RFC 4684 is to assign different RTs in different 
   kinds of VPNs.  

   One possible way is to pre-allocate disjoint RT ranges for different 
   kinds of VPN services, such as allocate RT-1 to RT-X for IPv4 VPN, 
   and RT-(X+1) to RT-Y for IPv6 VPN, RT-(Y+1) to RT-Z for L2VPN, etc. 
   This requires well planning of RT space for different kinds of VPNs 
   before the deployment of any VPN service. Since usually the VPN 
   services are not developed, designed and deployed simultaneously, 
   this solution seems not quite practical.  

   Another scheme is to make sure each RT is only used in one kind of 
   VPN service, e.g. if RT-X is used in IPv4 VPN, it cannot be used in 
   any other kind of VPN. This does not require pre-allocated disjoint 
   RT space for each VPN service, but operators has to assign RTs very 
   carefully to make sure that each RT is only used in one kind of VPN. 
   This brings additional planning and management burdens to operators 
   during the deployment of new VPN services.  

   As described in previous sections, in some cases the operators may 
   prefer to use the same RT for different kinds of VPN services, such 
   as IPv4 and IPv6 L3VPNs, or unicast and multicast VPNs. The unique RT 
   assignment can not work in these scenarios. 

   In the case of inter-provider VPNs, different providers need to 
   cooperate on the choice of RTs, which makes it more difficult to 
 
 
Dong, et al.          Expires January 12, 2011                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft      BGP Based VPN Route Constrain            July 2010 
    

   select proper RTs for inter-provider VPNs based on the above 
   solutions. 

6.2.2. Generalized RT Constrain 

   This section provides a solution which totally eliminates the 
   restriction on RT assignment among different kinds of VPNs, thus 
   keeps the management of RTs in one kind of VPN independent of the 
   other kinds of VPNs. This will relieve operators' burden on planning 
   and management of different VPN services. 

   This solution proposes to extend RFC 4684 to a more general method 
   for controlling the route distribution of all kinds of BGP based VPNs 
   in any scenario. 

   In order to identify corresponding AFI of VPN routes that the RT 
   membership NLRI stands for, this document proposes to extend the AFI 
   value of RT membership NLRI. The AFI of this NLRI SHOULD be one of 
   the AFIs that use Route Target to control route distribution. This 
   document defines a new SAFI called Generalized Route Target 
   Membership. A new SAFI value needs to be assigned by IANA. Thus the 
   [AFI, SAFI] value pair of the Generalized RT Membership NLRI could be 
   [AFI=1, SAFI=TBA] for IPv4 L3VPN, and [AFI=2, SAFI=TBA] for IPv6 
   L3VPN, and [AFI=25, SAFI=TBA] for L2VPN, etc. Since currently there 
   is no fixed AFI value for L1VPN, a new AFI value MAY need to be 
   allocated by IANA, and the [AFI=TBD, SAFI=TBA] value pair represents 
   the Generalized RT membership NLRI of L1VPN. 

   In order to distinguish the control of VPN routes with the same AFI 
   value but different SAFIs, e.g. unicast L3VPN and MVPN, the 
   Generalized RT membership NLRI MUST contain the SAFI information of 
   the VPN routes being requested. Thus the Generalized RT membership 
   NLRI can be accurately identified as RT information of one particular 
   type of VPN route. Besides, if L1VPN and other kinds of VPNs are 
   deployed in the same network, and no fixed AFI value has been 
   allocated for L1VPN, the SAFI value of L1VPN can be used to identify 
   RT membership information of L1VPN. 

6.3. Proposed Format of Generalized RT Membership NLRI 

   The format of Generalized RT membership NLRI is structured as follows:

   The Length field is used to identify the total length of the rest 
   fields. [Author notes: Though this field is defined as "the length in 
   bits" in [RFC4760], it is RECOMMENDED that it represents the length 
   in octets of the rest fields as in [RFC4761] for convenience.]  

   The Origin AS field contains an Autonomous System number. Two octets 
   AS numbers are encoded in the two low order octets of the Origin AS 
   field, with the two high order octets set to zero. 

   The "SAFI of VPN" field is the SAFI value of the VPN routes the PE 
   wants to import using the Route Target below. 

   The Route Target field contains Route Target of VPN routes being 
   requested. Note the length of the Route Target field is variable, and 
   can be calculated using the Length field of this NLRI.  

7. Capability advertisement 

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange Generalized RT membership 
   NLRI, they MUST use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that 
   they both are capable of properly processing such NLRI. This is done 
   as specified in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (multiprotocol 
   BGP) with an AFI of the corresponding VPN and an SAFI of TBA. 

8. Security Considerations 

   This document does not change the security properties of BGP based 
   VPNs and RFC 4684.  

9. IANA Considerations 

   IANA needs to assign a SAFI value for Generalized Route Target 
   Membership. This code point will come from the "Subsequent Address 
   Family Identifiers" registry.

Appendix A. Use of Route Target in Single Kind of VPN Service 

   The use of Route Target for single kind of VPN has been specified in 
   some IETF documents. 

   [RFC4364] specifies the use of RT in IPv4 VPNs:  

     A Route Target attribute can be thought of as identifying a set of 
     sites. (Though it would be more precise to think of it as 
     identifying a set of VRFs.)  Associating a particular Route Target 
     attribute with a route allows that route to be placed in the VRFs 
     that are used for routing traffic that is received from the 
     corresponding sites. 

     Suppose it is desired to create a fully meshed closed user group, 
     i.e., a set of sites where each can send traffic directly to the 
     other, but traffic cannot be sent to or received from other sites. 
     Then each site is associated with a VRF, a single Route Target 
     attribute is chosen, that Route Target is assigned to each VRF as 
     both the Import Target and the Export Target, and that Route Target 
     is not assigned to any other VRFs as either the Import Target or 
     the Export Target. 

 
 
Dong, et al.          Expires January 12, 2011               [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft      BGP Based VPN Route Constrain            July 2010 
    

     Alternatively, suppose one desired, for whatever reason, to create 
     a "hub and spoke" kind of VPN.  This could be done by the use of 
     two Route Target values, one meaning "Hub" and one meaning "Spoke".  
     At the VRFs attached to the hub sites, "Hub" is the Export Target 
     and "Spoke" is the Import Target.  At the VRFs attached to the 
     spoke site, "Hub" is the Import Target and "Spoke" is the Export 
     Target. 

   [RFC4659] states the use of Route Target in IPv6 VPNs: 

     The use of route target is specified in [BGP/MPLS-VPN] and applies 
     to IPv6 VPNs. Encoding of the extended community attribute is 
     defined in [BGP-EXTCOM]. 

   [RFC4761] describes the use of Route Target in VPLS: 

     The semantics of the use of Route Targets is described in [RFC4364]; 
     their use in VPLS is identical. 

     As it has been assumed that VPLSs are fully meshed, a single Route 
     Target RT suffices for a given VPLS V, and in effect that RT is the 
     identifier for VPLS V. 

   [RFC5195] states the use of Route Target in L1VPN auto-discovery: 

     To restrict the flow of this information to only the PITs within a 
     given L1VPN, we use BGP route filtering based on the Route Target 
     Extended Community [BGP-COMM], as follows. 

     Each PIT on a PE is configured with one or more Route Target 
     Communities, called "export Route Targets", that are used for 
     tagging the local information when it is exported into the 
     provider's BGP. The granularity of such tagging could be as fine as 
     a single <CPI, PPI> pair.  In addition, each PIT on a PE is 
     configured (at provisioning time) with one or more Route Target 
     Communities, called "import Route Targets", that restrict the set 
     of routes that could be imported from provider's BGP into the PIT 
     to only the routes that have at least one of these Communities. 

   [MVPN-BGP] specifies the use of RT in Multicast IP VPNs: 

     To support MVPN in addition to the import/export Route Target(s) 
     extended communities used by the unicast routing, each VRF on a PE 
     MUST have an import Route Target extended community, except if it 
     is known a priori that none of the (local) MVPN sites associated 
     with the VRF contain multicast source(s) and/or C-RP, in which case 
     the VRF need not have this import Route Target.

     We refer to this Route Target as the "C-multicast Import RT", as 
     this Route Target controls imports of C-multicast routes into a 
     particular VRF. 

     By default the distribution of the Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D routes is 
     controlled by the same Route Targets as the ones used for the 
     distribution of VPN-IP unicast routes... The default could be 
     modified via configuration by having a set of Route Targets used 
     for the Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D routes being distinct from the ones 
     used for the VPN-IP unicast routes. 

     An ASBR MUST be configured with a set of (import) Route Targets 
     (RTs) that specifies the set of MVPNs supported by the ASBR. These 
     Route Targets control acceptance of Intra-AS/Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D 
     routes by the ASBR. As long as unicast and multicast connectivity 
     are congruent, this could be the same set of Route Targets as the 
     one used for supporting unicast (and therefore would not require 
     any additional configuration above and beyond of what is required 
     for unicast). 

     The ASBR MUST be (auto-)configured with an import Route Target 
     called "ASBR Import RT". ASBR Import RT controls acceptance of Leaf 
     A-D routes and C-multicast routes by the ASBR, and is used to 
     constrain distribution of both Leaf A-D routes and C-multicast 
     routes. 

   [L2VPN-BGP] uses Route Target to define the topology of L2VPN: 

     Each PE is configured with the VPNs in which it participates. Each 
     VPN is associated with one or more Route Target communities 
     [RFC4360] which serve to define the topology of the VPN. 

   [L2VPN-SIG] specifies the coordination in RT assignment between 
   different operators in inter-provider L2VPN scenarios. 

     The main challenge is that it is necessary for the operator of one 
     AS to know what RT or RTs have been chosen in another AS for any 
     VPN that has sites in both ASes. As in layer 3 VPNs, there are many 
     ways to make this work, but all require some co-operation among the 
     providers. 

   [VPLS-MCAST] describes the use of RT for VPLS Multicast in a similar 
   way to mechanisms defined in [MVPN-BGP]. 

   [VPMS-BGP] describes the use of RT in VPMS service in section 5 "VPMS 
   Auto-Discovery":

     This document reuses the procedures described in [VPLS-MCAST] for 
     auto-discovery with modifications described in this document. 

     The BGP A-D route MUST carry the set of Route Targets being 
     exported by the VPMS instance. 

     As described in the section "Layer 2 Multicast VPN" the information 
     about whether a CE belongs to a sender site or a receiver site is 
     determined from the Route Targets (RT) that are configured to 
     enforce the administrative policies of a L2 MVPN. These RTs are 
     advertised in the corresponding BGP A-D routes. For instance if 
     some of the sites in a VPMS are only in sender site set while 
     others are only in receiver sites set, then CEs that are in the 
     receiver site set are configured to import only sender site set RTs. 
     While CEs that are in the sender site set are configured to import 
     only the receiver site set RTs. In this case two RTs are required 
     to provision the VPMS instance.
