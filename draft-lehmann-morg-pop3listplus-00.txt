            The Post Office Protocol (POP3) LIST+ Extension
                   draft-lehmann-morg-pop3listplus-00

Abstract

   The Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) LIST+ Extension allows a
   POP3 client to instruct a POP3 server to send additional information
   with the LIST command response.  This will help save message round
   trips and bandwidth overhead, especially on mailboxes containing
   several messages.  On public POP3 servers, serving thousands of
   mailboxes, and being polled frequently, LIST+ will help reduce server
   load.

Note

   This document defines an extension to POP3, and updates RFC 1939.

   Technical comments are solicited and should be addressed to Message

Internet-Draft            POP3 LIST+ Extension             February 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the term "client" refers to a host making use of
   the POP3 service, while the term "server" refers to a host which
   offers the POP3 service.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

1.2.  Overview

   Although POP3 is intended as a download-and-delete protocol, clients
   can decide to leave messages on the server, resulting in mailboxes
   containing several messages.  Observations on a public POP3 server
   have shown several POP3 clients using the LIST command, and,
   immediately followed, the UIDL command to get the Message Number,
   Message Size and Unique-ID, of all messages of a mailbox, to see if
   new messages have arrived.  On large mailboxes, holding hundreds or
   thousands of mails, this causes serious resource consumption on the
   server, and will prolong the duration a mailbox is hold in locked
   state.  This situation is even stressed by the fact that POP3 clients
   will usually poll a mailbox for new messages periodically in short
   intervals.

   The LIST command has to scan through all messages of a mailbox to
   support the Message Number and the Message Size.  The following UIDL
   command also has to scan through all messages of a mailbox to support
   the Message Number and the Unique-ID.  The Message Number sent with
   the UIDL command, in this scenario, is already known to the client,
   and therefore, is a redundant information (as in example shown in
   Appendix A.1).

   Using the LIST+ Extension, a server has to scan through the mailbox
   only for a single time, and can send the Message Number, Message Size
   and Unique-ID in a more compact form to the client (as shown in
   Appendix A.2.1).

   The LIST+ Extension also offers the possibility to fetch other useful

Internet-Draft            POP3 LIST+ Extension             February 2011


   information with the LIST command quasi "on the fly", like the age of
   a message, or the number of days a message is unread.  This may be
   helpful for clients to decide if a message has to be deleted
   automatically due to clients' message deleting policies.  There is no
   need to read the mail headers to make this decision in this case.


2.  The LIST+ Capability

   This section defines the LIST+ Capability according to Section 9 of
   [RFC2449].

   CAPA tag:
      LIST+

   Arguments:
      Supported LIST+ Flags

   Added commands:
      none

   Standard commands affected:
      LIST

   Announces states / possible differences:
      both / no

   Commands valid in states:
      n/a

   Specification reference:
      This document and [RFC1939]

   Discussion:
      The LIST+ capability enables the use of the indicated LIST+ Flags
      as additional parameters of the LIST command.


3.  The LIST Command

   This section updates the syntax of the LIST command as well as the
   definition of the scan listing, both as defined in Section 5 of
   [RFC1939].

   Formal syntax: LIST [msg] [flaglist]

   The flaglist is a list of LIST+ Flags, separated by a single space.
   A LIST+ Flag always starts with "+" (it means "add the following



Lehmann                  Expires August 7, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            POP3 LIST+ Extension             February 2011


   information"), followed by the name of the flag.  A flag name MUST
   start with a letter ("A-Z" or "a-z").  It is RECOMMENDED to keep flag
   names as short as possible.

   A server, supporting LIST+, has to decide whether the first argument
   of the LIST command (if any) is a message number or a LIST+ Flag.  If
   an argument starts with "+", and its second character is a letter,
   this parameter is to be considered as a LIST+ flag.

   If the server receives a LIST+ flag which is not supported, the
   server MUST issue a "-ERR" response.

   After the server has accepted a flaglist, it sends an extended scan
   listing for each requested message back to the client.  The extended
   scan listing consists of:

   o  The message-number of the message, followed by a single space

   o  The exact size of the message in octets, followed by a single
      space

   o  The value(s) as requested by the flaglist, separated each by a
      single space, in the same order as given in the flaglist.  A value
      MUST consist of only ASCII characters in the range of 33-126 (hex
      21-7E).  Otherwise, it is RECOMMENDED to use BASE64 encoding
      according to [RFC4648].

   See Appendix B for a formal syntax using ABNF.


4.  Initial Set of LIST+ Flags

4.1.  The +UIDL Flag

   The +UIDL Flag requests to add the Unique-ID of a message to the
   extended scan listing.  The Unique-ID for a message is the same value
   as it would be sent by the UIDL command for this message.  See
   [RFC1939], Section 7, "UIDL Command".

   Servers not supporting the UIDL command MUST NOT advertise the +UIDL
   Flag in the LIST+ capability list.

4.2.  The +AGE Flag

   The +AGE Flag requests to add the age of a message to the extended
   scan listing.  The age is expressed in units of whole days since the
   message was delivered into the mailbox.




Lehmann                  Expires August 7, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            POP3 LIST+ Extension             February 2011


   A message delivered yesterday (regardless of the time) has an age of
   one.  A message delivered today has an age of zero.  The value is
   presented as a decimal integer.

   Servers unable to determine the age of a message in this way MUST NOT
   advertise the +AGE Flag in the LIST+ capability list.

4.3.  The +UNREAD Flag

   The +UNREAD Flag requests to add the number of whole days, since the
   message was read for last time, to the extended scan listing.

   A message read yesterday (regardless of the time) for last time has a
   value of one.  A message read today has a value of zero.  The value
   is presented as a decimal integer.

   Servers unable to determine the number of whole days, since a message
   was read for last time, MUST NOT advertise the +UNREAD Flag in the
   LIST+ capability list.


5.   Parameter and Response Length

   The Parameter and Response Lengths, as defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC2449], are not affected by the LIST+ Extension Flags as defined
   in this document.

   The already defined Parameter and Response Lengths are sufficient to
   hold complete LIST+ command and response lines as defined in this
   document, even if all possible flags are given together.


6.  Future Extensions to LIST+

   The LIST+ Extension itself is expandable.  New LIST+ flags may be
   defined by future documents.  If such a document defines a LIST+ flag
   whose value contains characters outside the range as defined in
   Section 3, it MUST declare how to encode the value, so it fulfills
   the requirements of this document.

   Future documents defining new LIST+ flags MUST contain a statement
   whether the Parameter and Response Length, as defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC2449], are sufficient to hold lines with all possible flags/
   values, or not.  If not, new values for parameter and response length
   MUST be defined.

7.  Security Considerations

   The LIST+ Extension does not influence any security issues.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA maintain a new keyword "LIST+" in
   the "POP3 Capabilities" registry.

   This document requests that IANA maintain a new registry "POP3 LIST+
   Flags".

   This document requests that IANA maintain three new keywords,
   "+UIDL", "+AGE" and "+UNREAD", in the "POP3 LIST+ Flags" registry.


9.  Conclusions

   All mail program/server developers are encouraged to implement LIST+.

   All carriers of POP3 servers holding mailboxes of many, frequently
   polling clients are encouraged to support LIST+.

Appendix B.  Augmented BNF

   This section defines the LIST+ syntax using Augmented BNF (see
   [RFC5234] for details).  The following rules are for clarification
   only, and are not intended to supersede the definition of the LIST
   command, as defined in [RFC1939].

   listplus-req      = "LIST" [SP msg-num] [SP listplus-flaglist]
   listplus-rsp      = msg-num SP msg-size [*(SP listplus-value)]
   listplus-flaglist = listplus-flag [*(SP listplus-flag)]
   listplus-flag     = "+" ALPHA [*listplus-char]
   listplus-value    = 1*listplus-char
   listplus-char     = %x21-7E
   msg-num           = 1*DIGIT
   msg-size          = 1*DIGIT
