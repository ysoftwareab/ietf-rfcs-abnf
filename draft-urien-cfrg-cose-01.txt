Abstract 
    
   This document describes an architecture named "Cloud of Secure 
   Elements (CoSE)" whose goal is to strengthen the Internet trust. A 
   Secure element (SE) provides secure services thanks to various means 
   such as tamper resistant technologies or software virtualization 
   techniques. Secure elements are hosted in dedicated servers (i.e. 
   Trusted Secure Elements Servers, TSES); they provide secure storage 
   facilities or compute cryptographic procedures. Secure elements 
   resources are identified by dedicated URIs and should also support 
   HTTP interface. Users are equipped with "Access Credential" and 
   thanks to the Secure Transport Protocol (STP-TSES) remotely access 
   to Secure Element embedded resources. The RACS (Remote APDU Call 
   Secure) and its associated framework protocol is an early proof of 
   concept of the CoSE concept.

1 Overview 
    
   Internet technologies are more and more pervasive. Connected users 
   and devices produce and consume data that are exchanged over the 
   network and stored in data centers. The IETF has defined multiple 
   standards providing secure features such as authentication, privacy 
   or data integrity. 
    
   However the Internet suffers from a lack of trust. Recent facts were 
   reported by the press about pervasive surveillance over Internet 
   users; even if Internet protocols support privacy features, these 
   procedures require secret keys and strong cryptographic algorithms. 
    
   There is a trust issue towards all entities that provide 
   cryptographic facilities and secure storage of sensitive data. It 
   makes may wonder how trust these services are; in other words who 
   may access to secret values storage and use?. 
    
   In this document we discuss an architecture draft, named "Cloud of 
   Secure Elements (CoSe)", whose goal is to strengthen the Internet 
   trust. 
    
   Trust is a complex concept. A banknote is the root of trust for 
   commercial exchanges in a set of countries. Trust relies on 
   national, cultural, educative, social or professional beliefs. For 
   the most part, Internet trust relies on secure storage of passwords 
   both on users and servers sides. 
    
   The basic idea of the proposed architecture is to deploy Trusted 
   Secure Element Servers (TSES), whose trusted internal components 
   (the secure elements) could be used and managed by human or software 
   entities. This functional granularity is a key feature for the CoSE 
   paradigm. 
    
   TSES servers are managed by a plurality of entities and realized 
   security services for isolated users or numerous users. They could 
   be fitted for individual or worldwide needs. 
    
   TSES servers are accessed thanks to a Secure Transport Protocol 
   (STP-TSES), which always works with a strong mutual authentication, 
   which is used both for service and administration purposes, and 
   which is interoperable with all TSES. 
    
   Users or administrators are connected to TSES servers thanks to the 
   STP-TSES protocol. They need Access Credentials (AC) for mutual 
   authentication with TSES. Cryptographic procedures, long term 
   secrets, sensitive data are executed or stored in TSES. Users work 
   with multiple terminals with different level of trust and security. 
   These devices remotely access to critical data and procedures thanks 
   their Access Credentials; this feature implies native traceability 
   and easy revocation for lost or compromise terminals.

   The Cloud of Secure Elements comprises the following components: 
   - A set of Trusted Secure Element Servers (TSES). 
   - Secure Transport Protocol (STP-TSES), working with all TSES. 
   - Users and administrators, implementing STP-TSES, and equipped with 
   Access Credentials (AC). 
    
2.1 Trusted Secure Element Servers (TSES) 
    
   A Trusted Security Server manages a set of trusted entities called 
   Secure Elements (SE). A secure element provides secure services 
   thanks to various means such as tamper resistant technologies or 
   software virtualization techniques. 
    
   The main hypothesis is that users trust the SEs hosted in the TSES. 
    
   Secure Elements realizes services such as secure storage or 
   cryptographic procedures. These services are remotely installed, 
   updated or deleted by management entities. 
    
   Therefore SEs work according to two functional planes,  
   - An administrative plane. 
   - A user plane. 
    
   According to the CoSE model, the SE MUST provide isolated and safe 
   computing environment, according to criteria (for example 
   certifications) that are trusted by the users. SEs entities are 
   accessed via physical or logical protocols referred as Secure 
   Element Protocol (SEP).

                                   CoSE                    August 2014 
 
   There are two classes of SEP: 
   - Protocols (SEP-BER) based on well-known binary encoding rules 
   (BER), for example ISO7816 commands [ISO7816] exchanged with secure 
   ISO7816 microcontrollers. 
    
   - Protocols (SEP-API) based on the transport of application 
   programming Interface (API), for example the PKCS#11 [PKCS#11] API 
   usually referred as "cryptoki" widely used for the interface of 
   hardware secure module (HSM). 
    
2.2 Secure Transport Protocol (STP-TSES) 
    
   The Secure Transport Protocol (STP-TSES) drives the data exchange 
   between users and TSES servers. It MUST enforce a strong mutual 
   authentication between these entities, and also support identity 
   protection features on the client side. 
    
   The STP-TSES creates a secure session with the TSES server. 
    
   The STP-TSES mainly provides two services: 
   - The inventory of SEs hosted in TSES servers 
   - The transport of SEP messages, and their routing towards the 
   targeted Secure Element. 
    
   Each SE is identified by a secure element identifier (SEID). 
    
   STP-TSES services SHOULD be compatible with the [REST] 
   (Representational State Transfer) architecture. 
    
   Secure elements resources SHOULD be identified by dedicated URIs 
   (Uniform Resource Identifier). 
    
   An HTTP interface SHOULD be also supported. 
    
    
2.3 Users and Administrators 
    
   Users and administrators drive the data exchanges with TSES via the 
   STP-TSES protocol. There are equipped with Access Credentials (AC) 
   needed for mutual authentication with the TSES. 
    
   A secure tunnel is opened with the TSES. Thanks to their ACs 
   attributes, users and administrators privileges, dealing with the 
   two functional planes (user and administrative), are established by 
   the TSES. 
    
   Because Secure Elements handle cryptographic facilities, a second 
   secure channel MAY be opened between users (or administrators) and 
   SEs.

3. Remote APDU Call Secure (RACS) 
    
   RACS stands for "Remote APDU Call Secure" [RACS]. It is an early 
   proof of concept of the Cloud of Secure Elements. 
    
   The RACS framework enables secure remote access of data and 
   cryptographic procedures hosted in the CoSE. These elements are 
   identified by URIs and also support an HTTP interface. 
    
   In the RACS context, a Secure Element (SE) is a tamper resistant 
   microcontroller equipped with host interfaces such as ISO7816, SPI 
   (Serial Peripheral Interface) or I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit). 
    
   The typical area size of these electronic chips is about 25mm2. They 
   comprise CPU (8, 16, 32 bits), ROM (a few hundred KB), nonvolatile 
   memory (EEPROM, FLASH, a few hundred KB) and RAM (a few ten KB). 
   Security is enforced by multiple hardware and logical 
   countermeasures. 
    
   These Secure Elements are hosted in servers, whose commercial 
   appliances are usually referred as SIM-Servers. 
    
   The RACS protocol, is transported over the TLS protocol [TLS 1.0] 
   [TLS 1.1] [TLS 1.2], and works with a mandatory mutual 
   authentication. Both server and client are equipped with 
   certificates and associated private keys. RACS is used for the 
   transport of SEP messages; it also supports features for the SEs 
   inventory. 
    
   The SE protocol is based on the ISO7816 protocol, which defines the 
   binary encoding rules for request and response packets exchanged 
   with SE, refereed as APDUs (Application Protocol Data Unit). 
    
   The administration is compliant with a set of Global Platform [GP] 
   standards, which controls the lifecycle of SE embedded software, 
   i.e. application downloading, activation and deletion.
