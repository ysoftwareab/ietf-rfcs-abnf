1.  Introduction

   The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a single
   best path for each prefix.  Apart from BGP Add-Paths Proposal , today
   BGP has no other mechanisms to distribute paths other then best path
   between its speakers.  BGP Divrsepath proposal does not specify any
   changes to the BGP protocol definition as specificed by BGP Add-Paths
   proposal.  It does not require upgrades to provider edge or core
   routers nor does it need network wide upgrades.  Diverse Path
   attempts do solve the addpath problem and provision an interim
   solution to the customers who cannot deploy addpath solution on
   certain networks.  Due to the simple natiure of Diverse Path with
   simple upgrades and configuration to the Route Reflectors without any
   configurations on the edge routers, Diverse Path becomes very easy to
   deploy

   This document provides an implementation report for Diverse Path as
   defined in draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03

   The editor did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
   respondents or by any alternative means.  The respondents are experts
   with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
   considered authoritative for the implementations for which their
   responses represent.


2.  Implementation Forms

   Contact and implementation information for person filling out this
   form:

   Name: Satish Mynam, Email: mynam@cisco.com, Vendor: Cisco Systems,
   Inc. Release: IOS

2.1.  Support for multiple RRs

   Does the implementation support Sec.4.
   [draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03] Provision for Multi plane
   route reflection?

   Cisco: YES

   Does the implementation provide support for
   Sec4.1[draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03 ] Co-located best and
   backup path RRs?

   Cisco: YES

Internet-Draft  draft-mynam-grow-diverse-path-impl-00.txt  February 2011


   Does the implementation provide provision for Sec 4.3.
   [draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03] Multi plane route servers
   for Internet Exchanges?

   Cisco: YES

2.2.  Path Selection

   Does BGP diverse Path implementation follow the procedures for
   selection of the bestpath outlined in Section 9.1.Decision Process in
   RFC 4271?

   Cisco: YES

2.3.  Deployment Consideration

   Does BGP diverse Path implementation be easily enabled by
   introduction of a new route reflector, route server plane dedicated
   to the selection and distribution of Nth best-path?

   Cisco: YES

   Does BGP diverse Path implementation require any upgrades to the
   edge/core routers?

   Cisco: NO

   Can BGP diverse Path implementation be deployed on multiple RR
   clusters?

   Cisco: YES

   Does your BGP diverse Path implementation involve major modification
   to BGP implementations in the entire network?

   Cisco: NO

2.4.  Usage of Diverse Path

   Does BGP diverse Path implementation require any modifications to
   BGP4 protocol?

   Cisco: NO

   Does it help in the Multi-path load balancing applications for both
   IBGP and EBGP?

   Cisco: YES

Internet-Draft  draft-mynam-grow-diverse-path-impl-00.txt  February 2011


   Does the implementation support second session from RR to the same
   RR-client preferably terminated at a different loopback address of
   the route reflector and provide second bestpath to the RR-client?

   Cisco: NO

2.5.  Bestpath algorithm

   Does it add any modifications to the 9.1.Decision Process in RFC
   4271?  Does it skip any steps in the decision process?

   Cisco: NO.  No modifications to the algorithm are done except when
   RRs are not co-located and have different metric to reach the edge
   routers.  A configurable CLI command is provided for the user to
   control the disabling of the IGP metric check in the Decision Process
   to select bestpath and backupath

   Does the implementation provide support for disabling IGP metric for
   bestpath selection on Sec 4.2
   [draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03] randomly located best and
   backup path RRs?

   Cisco: YES

2.6.  Interoperable Implementations

   List other implementations that you have tested interoperability of
   Diverse Path

   Cisco: The implementation should be interoperable with other vendor
   BGP implementations as no BGP Protocol changes are needed


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


4.  Security considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.
