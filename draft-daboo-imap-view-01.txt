1 Abstract
    
    The VIEW extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
    permits a subset of messages in the mailbox to be processed
    separately from the entire set of messages in the mailbox.  This
    allows a client to restrict its view to only the messages appearing
    in this set.  The subset of messages also need not be returned in
    order of their sequence numbers, allowing clients to access messages
    in a particular sort order.
    
    The subsetting and sorting of messages is handled by existing
    [IMAP4] commands that return a set of messages as their result.
    This extension takes the set returned from such a command and
    applies the VIEW methodology to it.

IMAP VIEW Extension             October 1999

3 Introduction and Overview
    
    The VIEW extension is present in any IMAP4 implementation which
    returns "VIEW" as one of the supported capabilities in the
    CAPABILITY command.
    
    The VIEW extension specifies one new command and introduces one new
    untagged response, modifies two existing [IMAP4] commands and two
    existing [IMAP4] untagged responses, as well as putting requirements
    on standard IMAP4 protocol responses when the command is in effect.
    
    Each of the features in VIEW are optimizations; clients can provide
    the same functionality, albeit more slowly, by using existing
    commands.
    
    The design goal of the VIEW extension is to allow clients to
    reference messages only by their "view position numbers" as opposed
    to sequence numbers or UIDs, if so desired, and thus remove the need
    for the client to maintain its own mapping between sequence number,
    UID and view position.
    
    This extension makes the following changes to the IMAP4 protocol:
    
    a) Adds a new VIEW command which takes one of two forms:
       
        (i) The first form, VIEW SET, takes an optional sub-command and
        is used to initiate or cancel the view mechanism on the server.
        
        (ii) In the second form, the VIEW command is used with a FETCH,
        COPY, STORE or SEARCH command, and instructs the server to
        interpret the sequence numbers provided by the client in the
        command as VIEW positions (as described below), or to return
        results using view positions rather than sequence numbers.
        
    b) Allows the arguments of the VIEW SET command to appear as
        arguments of the SELECT or EXAMINE commands [IMAP4] to allow
        selecting a mailbox and setting a view in a single round-trip.
       
    When the VIEW SET command is used by the client, the following
    changes also take place:
    
    c) New FETCH message data response item:
       
        VIEW
            Indicates the position of messages in the view, which may be
            different from message sequence number.
            
    d) New untagged response:
       
        VIEW
            Indicates new message arrival, a change in position of a
            message within the current view or a message moving in or

            out of the current view.  The sequence number, UID and new
            view position number of the message are supplied, and
            optionally the old position when the message is not new.
            Can also be used to return SEARCH results using view
            position numbers rather than sequence numbers or UIDs.
            
    e) Changes to untagged responses and response codes:
       
        EXISTS
            The standard EXISTS response is enhanced to include
            information about the total number of messages in the
            current view.
            
        EXPUNGE
            The standard EXPUNGE response is enhanced to include
            information about message UID and view position.
    
    The rest of this document describes these changes more rigorously.
    The document will use the IMAP4 SEARCH command as an example of a
    sub-command to VIEW SET.  However, other commands can be used with
    VIEW SET as well.
    
    
4 Commands
    
4.1 VIEW Command
    
    The VIEW command takes one of two forms.
    
4.1.1 VIEW SET
    
    Arguments: OPTIONAL sub-command and associated arguments:
               this draft currently only allows the SEARCH command
               as the sub-command, however, anticipated SORT [SORT]
               and THREAD [THREAD] commands are expected to be
               added to this.
    
    Responses: REQUIRED untagged responses: modified EXISTS if
                                            sub-command present
    
    Result:    OK - view completed, now in view state
               NO - view failure
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid
    
    The VIEW SET command is only available when the server is in
    'selected state' [IMAP4].  Thus a successful SELECT or EXAMINE
    command MUST have been issued before VIEW SET can be used.  If a
    client attempts to use VIEW SET while the server is not in 'selected
    state', then the server MUST respond with a BAD response.  Note that
    a view can also be initiated during a SELECT or EXAMINE command, as
    described in Section 4.2.
    


Daboo, Crispin, Pustilnik          Expires April 2000          [Page 4]Internet Draft            
IMAP VIEW Extension             October 1999

    When the VIEW SET command is in effect (either by an explicit VIEW
    SET command or by a modified SELECT or EXAMINE command), it results
    in the following changes to the IMAP4 protocol:
    
    a) The server creates a 'view' that is a subset of messages in the
    mailbox that match the results of the sub-command.  The position of
    a message in the view, its view position number, is then given by
    the VIEW fetch item response.  Messages outside of the view have a
    view position of 0 (zero).
    
    b) The VIEW command can be used by the client to request information
    about messages in the current view set, without requiring the client
    to determine the view positions of every message in the mailbox (see
    Section 4.1.2).
    
    c) The server MUST return a VIEW fetch item in every FETCH response,
    including unsolicted FETCH responses.  This ensures the client does
    not need to maintain its own mapping from sequence numbers to view
    positions.
    
    d) A new VIEW untagged response MUST be sent by the server when new
    messages arrive or when existing messages move within the current
    view, or are moved into or out of the current view.
    
    e) The server MUST modify the EXISTS untagged response (see Section
    5.2) to include additional information to indicate the current
    number of messages in the view set.
    
    f) The server MUST modify the EXPUNGE untagged response (see Section
    5.3) to include additional information to indicate the expunged
    message's UID and view position number.
    
    g) The VIEW SET command with no sub-command can be used to turn off
    the view facility and return the server to standard IMAP4 behaviour.
    
    h) A VIEW SET command with a sub-command (see Section 4.1.2) can be
    used while another VIEW SET is in effect.  This results in the view
    being 'reset' to use the new VIEW SET parameters.
    
    i) Any SELECT, EXAMINE or CLOSE command issued while a VIEW SET is
    in effect has the behaviour of cancelling the current view behaviour
    and returns the server to standard [IMAP4] behaviour, unless the
    SELECT or EXAMINE commands include a new VIEW SET arguments as
    described in Section 4.2.
    
    Examples:
        C: A999 VIEW SET SEARCH FROM "Smith"
        S: * 23 EXISTS 5
        S: A999 OK VIEW SET completed

IMAP VIEW Extension             October 1999

4.1.2 VIEW <sub-command>
    
    Arguments:  command name
                command arguments
    
    Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH, VIEW SEARCH
    
    Result:     OK - VIEW command completed
                NO - VIEW command error
                BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid
    
    This version of the VIEW command has two forms.  In the first form,
    it takes as its arguments a COPY, FETCH, or STORE command [IMAP4]
    with arguments appropriate for the associated command.  However, the
    numbers in the message set argument are view position numbers
    instead of message sequence numbers.
    
    In the second form, the VIEW command takes a SEARCH command with
    SEARCH command arguments [IMAP4].  The interpretation of the
    arguments is the same as with SEARCH [IMAP4]; however, the numbers
    returned in a VIEW SEARCH response (see Section 5.1.3) for a VIEW
    SEARCH command are view position numbers instead of message sequence
    numbers.  In addition, the search is carried out only on those
    messages in the current view set, so a view position of 0 (zero)
    MUST NOT be returned in the search results.
    
    The number after the "*" in an untagged FETCH response is always a
    message sequence number, not a view position number, even for a VIEW
    command response.  However, server implementations MUST implicitly
    include the VIEW fetch item as part of any FETCH response caused by
    a VIEW command, regardless of whether a VIEW was specified as a
    message data item to the FETCH, as described in Section 4.1.1 (c).
    
    This version of the VIEW command is only available when the VIEW SET
    command is in effect.  Clients MUST NOT issue this version of the
    VIEW command when a VIEW SET is not in effect, and servers MUST
    respond with a tagged BAD response if it receives a VIEW command of
    this type when VIEW SET is not in effect.
    
    Examples:
        C: A999 VIEW FETCH 1:3 FLAGS
        S: * 23 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) VIEW 2)
        S: * 24 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) VIEW 3)
        S: * 25 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) VIEW 1)
        S: A999 OK VIEW FETCH completed
    
        C: A999 VIEW SEARCH UNSEEN
        S: * VIEW SEARCH 1 2 4 6
        S: A999 OK VIEW SEARCH completed

4.2 Modified SELECT and EXAMINE commands
    
    This extension modifies the syntax of the existing IMAP4 SELECT and
    EXAMINE commands as follows.
    
    Arguments:  mailbox name
                OPTIONAL view set arguments
    
    Response:   same as [IMAP4] except for modified EXISTS
    
    Result:     same as [IMAP4]
    
    The IMAP4 SELECT and EXAMINE commands are modified to include
    optional VIEW SET command arguments after the mailbox name.  This
    allows a client to select a mailbox and set a view in a single
    command.  The syntax for the optional arguments are the same as for
    the VIEW SET command arguments.
    
    When the optional VIEW SET command arguments are present, the EXISTS
    response that is normally sent by the server as part of the SELECT
    or EXAMINE command response is modified to include the current
    number of messages in the view, as described in Section 4.1.1 (e).
    
    Examples:
        C: A142 SELECT INBOX SEARCH FROM "Smith"
        S: * 172 EXISTS 5
        S: * 1 RECENT
        S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen
        S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid
        S: * OK [UIDNEXT 4392] Predicted next UID
        S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
        S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited
        S: A142 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT with VIEW SET completed
    
    
5 Responses
    
5.1 VIEW Untagged Response
    
    There are three forms of this response.
    
5.1.1 New message arrival
    
        <seq> VIEW <uid> <newpos>
    
        indicates that a new message has arrived with the given sequence
        number, UID and view position number
        
    When using the VIEW SET command, the VIEW untagged response augments
    the EXISTS untagged response as a means of new mail notification.
    Specifically it is used to tell the client where new messages appear
    in the current view.  The server MUST send an untagged VIEW response


Daboo, Crispin, Pustilnik          Expires April 2000          [Page 7]Internet Draft            
IMAP VIEW Extension             October 1999

    for every new message that arrives in the mailbox, after the
    corresponding untagged EXISTS response is sent to indicate this,
    when the VIEW SET command is in effect.
    
    
    When the VIEW SET command is in effect, and the view position number
    of a new message is non-zero (i.e. the new message appears in the
    current view), the untagged VIEW response causes the view position
    numbers of all subsequent messages in the mailbox's current view to
    be incremented.
    
    Example:
    
        C: NOOP
        S: * 173 EXISTS 24
        S: * 1 RECENT
        S: * 173 VIEW 5274234 14
        S: NOOP complete
    
        indicates that a new message with sequence number 173 and UID
        5274234 has been inserted into the view with view position
        number 14.  Any message that used to have a view position number
        14 is now at position 15, etc.
        
    If a new message arrives outside the current view (i.e. not matching
    the specified search criteria), the view position number of the new
    message is given as 0.
    
    Example:
    
        C: NOOP
        S: * 174 EXISTS 24
        S: * 2 RECENT
        S: * 174 VIEW 5274235 0
        S: NOOP complete
    
        indicates that a message has arrived with sequence number 174
        and UID 5274235, however, the VIEW SET command in effect
        prevents it from being in the current view.
    
    
5.1.2 Messages moving in the view
    
        <seq> VIEW <uid> <new> <old>
    
        indicates that a message with the given sequence number and UID
        has changed its position within the view
        
    Some sub-commands of the VIEW SET command may change the sort order
    of messages in the view.  In such a case, changes to message flags
    or keywords can cause the position of messages in sorted order to
    change.  Also, when search criteria are specified, changes to


Daboo, Crispin, Pustilnik          Expires April 2000          [Page 8]Internet Draft            
IMAP VIEW Extension             October 1999

    message flags or keywords can cause messages to move into or outside
    of the view.  The server MUST communicate these changes to the
    client by sending it the VIEW untagged response.
    
    When VIEW SET search criteria are in effect, changes made to a
    message can cause it to drop out of view or, on the contrary, become
    visible.  When a message drops out of view, the new view position
    number is sent as 0.  Similarly, when a message appears in view, for
    example, as a result of another agent changing the message
    attributes, the old view position number is sent as 0.
    
    When the old view position number in the VIEW untagged response is
    0, the effect of VIEW is a message inserted into the view at the
    position given by <new>.  The view position numbers of all
    subsequent messages in the current view are implicitly incremented.
    
    When the new view position number in the VIEW untagged response is
    0, the effect of VIEW is a message removed from the view at the
    position given by <old>.  The view position numbers of all
    subsequent messages in the current view are implicitly decremented.
    
    When both the <old> and <new> view positions are non-zero, then the
    view positions of messages between the <old> and <new> positions
    need to be implicitly decremented or incremented depending on
    whether the <old> view position is less than or greater than the
    <new> view position, respectively.
    
    It is meaningless to have a VIEW untagged response where both <old>
    and <new> view position numbers are 0; the server MUST NOT generate
    VIEW responses of this form.
    
    VIEW untagged responses indicating messages moving in the view MUST
    NOT be sent as the result of messages being expunged (which is
    handled by the modified untagged EXPUNGE response), or when no
    command is in progress, or while responding to a FETCH, SEARCH or
    STORE command.  These rules are necessary to prevent loss of
    synchronization of message sequence numbers between client and
    server.
    
    Examples:
    
        S: * 172 VIEW 5274234 2 14
    
        indicates that the view position of the message with sequence
        number 172 and UID equal to 5274234 has changed from 14 to 2.
        The view position numbers of the messages in the range 2:13 are
        incremented.
        
        S: * 172 VIEW 5274234 0 14
        
        indicates that the message with view position number 14 has
        dropped out of view.  The view position numbers of subsequent

IMAP VIEW Extension             October 1999

        messages are decremented.  The message continues to exist,
        however, it is outside of the current view and is therefore no
        longer accessible to the session via the VIEW command.
        
        S: * 173 VIEW 5274234 2 0
        
        indicates that the message with UID 5274234 has appeared in the
        current view and has been assigned view position number 2.  The
        view position numbers of subsequent messages are incremented.
    
    
5.1.3 VIEW SEARCH Response
    
        VIEW SEARCH <zero or more view position numbers>
    
    The VIEW SEARCH response occurs as a result of a VIEW SEARCH
    command.  The view position number(s) refer to those messages that
    match the search criteria.  Each number is delimited by a space.
    
    Example:  S: * VIEW SEARCH 2 3 6
    
    
5.2 EXISTS Untagged Response
    
        <# in mailbox> EXISTS <# in view>
    
        indicates the total number of messages in the mailbox and in the
        current view
        
    The modified EXISTS untagged response MUST only be used when the
    VIEW SET command is in effect.  This MUST be sent in response to a
    VIEW SET command taking a sub-command argument.  Otherwise this
    response is sent under the same circumstances as the unmodifed
    EXISTS response (i.e. in when there is a change to the total number
    of messages in the mailbox).
    
    Example:
    
        C: A142 SELECT INBOX
        S: * 172 EXISTS
        S: * 3 RECENT
        S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen
        S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857429045] UIDs valid
        S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
        S: OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited
        S: A142 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed
        C: A143 VIEW SET SEARCH FROM "Smith"
        S: * 172 EXISTS 23
        S: A143 OK VIEW SET completed
    
    In this example, there are 172 messages in the mailbox and 23
    messages have a from address including the text "Smith".

5.3 EXPUNGE Untagged Response
    
        <seq> EXPUNGE <uid> <pos>
    
        indicates that a message with given sequence number, UID and
        view position number has been permanently removed from the
        mailbox
        
    When VIEW SET is in effect, the EXPUNGE untagged response [IMAP4] is
    modified to include the UID and view position number of the message
    being expunged.  The server MUST use this modified form of the
    EXPUNGE response whenever a VIEW SET command is in effect.
    
    When search criteria are specified in the VIEW SET command, and a
    message outside the current view is expunged, the view position
    number of the expunged message is given as 0.
    
    When the view position number of the expunged message is non-zero,
    the modified EXPUNGE untagged response causes the view position
    numbers of all subsequent messages in the mailbox's current view to
    be decremented.
    
    Examples:
    
        S: * 172 EXPUNGE 5274234 14
    
        indicates that the message with sequence number 172, UID 5274234
        and view position number 14 has been expunged from its mailbox.
        Any message previously at position 15 is now at position 14, etc
        
        S: * 173 EXPUNGE 5274234 0
        
        indicates that a message with sequence number 173, UID 5274234
        was expunged, however, the message was outside the current view.
        
    A modified EXPUNGE untagged response MUST NOT be sent when no
    command is in progress; nor while responding to a FETCH, SEARCH or
    STORE command.  This rule is necessary to prevent loss of
    synchronization of message sequence numbers between client and
    server.
