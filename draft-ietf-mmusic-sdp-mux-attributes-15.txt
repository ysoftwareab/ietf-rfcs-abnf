            A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing
                draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes-15

Abstract

   The purpose of this specification is to provide a framework for
   analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) attributes when SDP is used to negotiate the usage of
   single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
   multiple media descriptions.

   This specification also categorizes the existing SDP attributes based
   on the framework described herein.

1.  Introduction

   SDP defines several attributes for capturing characteristics that
   apply to the individual media descriptions (described by "m=" lines")
   and the overall multimedia session.  Typically different media types
   (audio, video, etc.) described using different media descriptions
   represent separate RTP sessions that are carried over individual
   transport layer flows.  However
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] defines a way to use a
   single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media
   associated with multiple SDP media descriptions.  This would, for
   example allow the usage of a single set of Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] candidates for multiple media
   descriptions.  This in turn has made it necessary to understand the
   interpretation and usage of the SDP attributes defined for the
   multiplexed media descriptions.

   Given the number of SDP attributes registered with the [IANA] and
   possibility of new attributes being defined in the future, there is
   need for a framework to analyze these attributes for their
   applicability in the transport multiplexing use-cases.

   The document starts with providing the motivation for requiring such
   a framework.  This is followed by introduction to the SDP attribute
   analysis framework/procedures, following which several sections apply
   the framework to the SDP attributes registered with the [IANA].

2.  Terminology

   5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source address, source
   port, destination address, destination port, and transport-layer
   protocol.

3.  Motivation

   The time and complications of setting up ICE [RFC5245] and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) based Secure Real-time Transport
   Protocol (SRTP) [RFC5763] transports for use by RTP, reasons to
   conserve ports bindings on the Network Address Translators (NAT),
   forms a requirement to try and reduce the number of transport level
   flows needed.  This has resulted in the definition of ways, such as
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] to multiplex RTP over a
   single transport flow in order to preserve network resources such as
   port numbers.  This imposes further restrictions on applicability of
   the SDP attributes as they are defined today.

   The specific problem is that there are attribute combinations which
   make sense when specified on independent "m=" lines -- as with
   classical SDP -- that do not make sense when those "m=" lines are
   then multiplexed over the same transport.  To give an obvious
   example, ICE permits each "m=" line to have an independently
   specified ice-ufrag attribute.  However, if the media from multiple
   "m=" lines is multiplexed over the same ICE component, then the
   meaning of media-level ice-ufrag attributes becomes muddled.

   At the time of writing this document there are close to 250 SDP
   attributes registered with the [IANA] and more will be added in the
   future.  There is no clearly defined procedure to establish the
   validity/applicability of these attributes when used with transport
   multiplexing.

4.  SDP Attribute Analysis Framework

   Attributes in an SDP session description can be defined at the
   session-level or media-level or source-level.  Informally, there are
   various semantic groupings for these attributes.  One such grouping
   could be notes as below:

   o  Attributes related to media content such as media type, encoding
      schemes and payload types.

   o  Attributes specifying media transport characteristics like RTP/RTP
      Control Protocol (RTCP) port numbers, network addresses and QOS.

   o  Metadata description attributes capturing session timing and
      origin information.

   o  Attributes establishing relationships between media descriptions
      such as grouping framework [RFC5888]

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing          December 2016


   The proposed framework analyzes the SDP attributes usage under
   multiplexing and assigns each SDP attribute to an appropriate
   multiplexing category.  Since the multiplexing categories defined in
   this specification are independent of any informal semantic groupings
   of the SDP attributes, the categorizations assigned are normative.

4.1.  Category: NORMAL

   The attributes in the NORMAL category can be independently specified
   when multiplexed and they retain their original semantics.

   In the example given below, the direction and label attributes are
   independently specified for audio and video "m=" lines.  These
   attributes are not impacted by multiplexing these media streams over
   a single transport layer flow.

4.2.  Category: CAUTION

   The attributes in the CAUTION category are advised against
   multiplexing since their usage under multiplexing might lead to
   incorrect behavior.

   Example: Multiplexing media descriptions over a single Datagram
   Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) transport [RFC5762] is not
   recommended since DCCP being a connection oriented protocol doesn't
   allow multiple connections on the same 5-tuple.

4.3.  Category: IDENTICAL

   The attributes and their associated values (if any) in the IDENTICAL
   category MUST be repeated across all the media descriptions under
   multiplexing.

   Attributes such as rtcp-mux fall into this category.  Since RTCP
   reporting is done per RTP session, RTCP Multiplexing MUST be enabled
   for both the audio and video "m=" lines if they are transported over
   a single 5-tuple.

4.4.  Category: SUM

   The attributes in the SUM category can be set as they are normally
   used but software using them in the multiplexing scenario MUST apply
   the sum of all the attributes being multiplexed instead of trying to
   use them independently.  This is typically used for bandwidth or
   other rate limiting attributes to the underlying transport.

   The software parsing the SDP sample below, should use the aggregate
   Application Specific (AS) bandwidth value from the individual media

   descriptions to determine the AS value for the multiplexed session.
   Thus the calculated AS value would be 256+64 kilobits per second for
   the given example.

4.5.  Category: TRANSPORT

   The attributes in the TRANSPORT category can be set normally for
   multiple items in a multiplexed group but the software MUST pick the
   one that's associated with the "m=" line whose information is used
   for setting up the underlying transport.

   In the example below, "a=crypto" attribute is defined for both the
   audio and the video "m=" lines.  The video media line's a=crypto
   attribute is chosen since its mid value (bar) appears first in the
   a=group:BUNDLE line.  This is due to BUNDLE grouping semantic
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] which mandates the values
   from "m=" line corresponding to the mid appearing first on the
   a=group:BUNDLE line to be considered for setting up the RTP
   Transport.

4.6.  Category: INHERIT

   The attributes in the INHERIT category encapsulate other SDP
   attributes or parameters.  These attributes inherit their
   multiplexing characteristics from the attributes or parameters they
   encapsulate.  Such attributes are defined in [RFC3407], [RFC5939] and
   [RFC6871] as part of a generic framework for indicating and
   negotiating transport, media, and media format related capabilities
   in the SDP.

   The inheritance manifests itself when the encapsulated attribute or
   parameter is being leveraged.  In the case of SDP Capability
   Negotiation [RFC5939] for example, this occurs when a capability
   (encapsulating attribute) is used as part of a configuration; the
   configuration inherits the multiplexing category of each of its
   constituent (encapsulated) attributes and parameters.  The inherited
   attributes MUST be coherent in order to form a valid configuration
   from a multiplexing point of view (see Section 14 for further
   details).

          a=rtpmap:101 VP8/90000
          a=fmtp:100 max-fr=15;max-fs=1200
          a=cdsc: 2 video RTP/AVP 101
          a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux

   In the above example, the category IDENTICAL is inherited by the cpar
   encapsulated rtcp-mux attribute.

4.7.  Category: IDENTICAL-PER-PT

   The attributes in the IDENTICAL-PER-PT category define the RTP
   payload configuration on per Payload Type basis and MUST have
   identical values across all the media descriptions for a given RTP
   Payload Type when repeated.  These Payload Types identify the same
   codec configuration as defined in the Section 10.1.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] under this context.

   In the SDP example below, Payload Types 96 and 97 are repeated across
   all the video "m=" lines and all the payload specific parameters (ex:
   rtpmap, fmtp) are identical (Note: some line breaks included are due
   to formatting only).

        max-mbps=7200; max-br=200

4.8.  Category: SPECIAL

   For the attributes in the SPECIAL category, the text in the
   specification defining the attribute MUST be consulted for further
   handling when multiplexed.

   As an exampe, for the attribute extmap [RFC5285], the specification
   defining the extension needs to be referred to understand the
   multiplexing implications.

4.9.  Category: TBD

   The attributes in the TBD category have not been analyzed under the
   proposed multiplexing framework and SHOULD NOT be multiplexed.

5.  Analysis of Existing Attributes

   This section analyzes attributes listed in [IANA], grouped under the
   IETF document that defines them.

   The "Level" column indicates whether the attribute is currently
   specified as:

   o  S -- Session level

   o  M -- Media level

   o  B -- Both (Implies either a session level or a media level
      attribute)

   o  SR -- Source-level (for a single SSRC) [RFC5576]

   The "Mux Category" column identifies multiplexing category assigned
   per attribute and the "Notes" column captures additional informative
   details regarding the assigned category, wherever necessary.

5.1.  RFC4566: SDP

   [RFC4566] defines SDP that is intended for describing multimedia
   sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session
   invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation.

   NOTE: If RFC6773 is being used in addition to RFC5762 and provided
   that DCCP-in-UDP layer has additional demultiplexing, then it can be
   possible to use different DCCP service codes for each DCCP flow,
   given each uses a different DCCP port.  Although doing so might
   conflict with the media type of the "m=" line.  None of this is
   standardized yet and it wouldn't work as explained.  Hence performing
   multiplexing is not recommended even in this alternate scenario.

5.9.  RFC6773: DCCP-UDP Encapsulation

   [RFC6773] specifies an alternative encapsulation of DCCP, referred to
   as DCCP-UDP.  This encapsulation allows DCCP to be carried through
   the current generation of Network Address Translation (NAT) middle
   boxes without modification of those middle boxes.

   allows arbitrary DCCP packets to be encapsulated and the DCCP port
   chosen can conflict with the port chosen for the RTP traffic.  For
   multiplexing several DCCP-in-UDP encapsulations on the same UDP port
   with no RTP traffic on the same port implies collapsing several DCCP
   port spaces together.  This can or cannot work depending on the
   nature of DCCP encapsulation and ports choices thus rendering it to
   be very application dependent.

5.11.  RFC6787: Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2

   The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
   hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers,
   recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the
   network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on
   other protocols, such as the SIP, to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and
   servers, and manage session between them, and SDP to describe,
   discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP
   to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the
   media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the
   MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above,
   allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the
   speech resource server.  [RFC6787] defines attributes for this
   purpose.

5.14.  RFC3605: RTCP attribute in SDP

   Originally, SDP assumed that RTP and RTCP were carried on consecutive
   ports.  However, this is not always true when NATs are involved.
   [RFC3605] specifies an early mechanism to indicate the RTCP port.

5.15.  RFC5576: Source-Specific SDP Attributes

   [RFC5576] defines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, which
   are identified by their synchronization source (SSRC) identifiers, in
   SDP, to associate attributes with these sources, and to express
   relationships among sources.  It also defines several source-level
   attributes that can be used to describe properties of media sources.

   [RFC6236] proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make it
   possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image size.
   A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end hand-held
   terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
   something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing
   power.  The document also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for
   video as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is
   transmitted.

                      5.24 RFC3407 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: The attributes (a=cparmin and a=cparmax) define minimum and
   maximum numerical values associated with the attributes described in
   a=cpar.

   Since the cpar attribute can either define a 'b=' attribute or any
   'a=' attribute, the multiplexing category depends on actual attribute
   being encapsulated and the implications of the numerical values
   assigned.  Hence it is recommended to consult the specification
   defining attributes (cparmin/cparmax) to further analyze their
   behavior under multiplexing.

5.25.  RFC6284: Port Mapping between Unicast and Multicast RTP Sessions

   [RFC6284] presents a port mapping solution that allows RTP receivers
   to choose their own ports for an auxiliary unicast session in RTP
   applications using both unicast and multicast services.  The solution
   provides protection against denial-of-service or packet amplification
   attacks that could be used to cause one or more RTP packets to be
   sent to a victim client.

5.26.  RFC6714: MSRP-CEMA

   [RFC6714] defines a Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) extension,
   Connection Establishment for Media Anchoring (CEMA).  Support of this
   extension is optional.  The extension allows middle boxes to anchor
   the MSRP connection, without the need for middle boxes to modify the
   MSRP messages; thus, it also enables secure end-to-end MSRP
   communication in networks where such middle boxes are deployed.  This
   document also defines a SDP attribute, 'msrp-cema', that MSRP
   endpoints use to indicate support of the CEMA extension.

   categories assignments for the attributes in this section could be
   revisited.

5.27.  RFC4583: SDP Format for BFCP Streams

   [RFC4583] document specifies how to describe Binary Floor Control
   Protocol (BFCP) streams in SDP descriptions.  User agents using the
   offer/answer model to establish BFCP streams use this format in their
   offers and answers.

   advanced Voice over IP (VoIP), Real-time Text, and Video over IP
   performance metrics.

                     5.33 RFC6871 - Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: The "sescap" attribute is not recommended for use with
   multiplexing.  The reason is that it requires the use of unique
   configuration numbers across the entire SDP (per [RFC6871]) as
   opposed to within a media description only (per [RFC5939]).  As
   described in Section 14, the use of identical configuration numbers
   between multiplexed (bundled) media descriptions is the default way
   of indicating compatible configurations in a bundle.

5.34.  RFC7006: Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation SDP

   [RFC7006] extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
   endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In
   particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth
   ("b=" line), connection data ("c=" line), and session or media titles
   ("i=" line for each session or media).

   [RFC4567] defines general extensions for SDP and Real Time Streaming
   Protocol (RTSP) to carry messages, as specified by a key management
   protocol, in order to secure the media.  These extensions are
   presented as a framework, to be used by one or more key management
   protocols.  As such, their use is meaningful only when complemented
   by an appropriate key management protocol.

5.36.  RFC4572: Comedia over TLS in SDP

   [RFC4572] specifies how to establish secure connection-oriented media
   transport sessions over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
   using SDP.  It defines a new SDP protocol identifier, 'TCP/TLS'.  It
   also defines the syntax and semantics for an SDP 'fingerprint'
   attribute that identifies the certificate that will be presented for
   the TLS session.  This mechanism allows media transport over TLS
   connections to be established securely, so long as the integrity of
   session descriptions is assured.

   [RFC4570] describes how to adapt SDP to express one or more source
   addresses as a source filter for one or more destination "connection"
   addresses.  It defines the syntax and semantics for an SDP "source-
   filter" attribute that may reference either IPv4 or IPv6 address(es)
   as either an inclusive or exclusive source list for either multicast
   or unicast destinations.  In particular, an inclusive source-filter
   can be used to specify a Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) session.

5.38.  RFC6128: RTCP Port for Multicast Sessions

   SDP has an attribute that allows RTP applications to specify an
   address and a port associated with the RTCP traffic.  In RTP-based
   source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used
   to designate the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in
   the SDP description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM
   session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid
   ambiguity, and thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of
   the media description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line
   imposes an unnecessary restriction.  [RFC6128] removes this
   restriction by introducing a new SDP attribute.

   nettype value of "IN".  If in future there exists a specification
   that defines procedures to multiplex media streams over nettype
   "PSTN", the multiplexing categories for attributes in this section
   could be revisited.

   The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level
   protocol for control over the delivery of data with real-time
   properties.  RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable
   controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and
   video.

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing          December 2016


   NOTE: [RFC2326] defines SDP attributes that are applicable in the
   declarative usage of SDP alone.  For purposes of this document, only
   the Offer/Answer usage of SDP is considered as mandated by
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].

5.47.  RFC6064: SDP and RTSP Extensions for 3GPP

   The Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) and the Multimedia
   Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) defined by 3GPP use SDP and RTSP
   with some extensions.  [RFC6064] provides information about these
   extensions and registers the RTSP and SDP extensions with IANA.

                      5.48 RFC3108 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: RFC3108 describes conventions for using SDP for characterizing
   ATM bearer connections using an AAL1, AAL2 or AAL5 adaptation layers.
   For AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5, bearer connections can be used to transport
   single media streams.  In addition, for AAL1 and AAL2, multiple media
   streams can be multiplexed into a bearer connection.  For all
   adaptation types (AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5), bearer connections can be
   bundled into a single media group.  In all cases addressed by
   RFC3108, a real-time media stream (voice, video, voiceband data,
   pseudo-wire, and others) or a multiplex of media streams is mapped
   directly into an ATM connection.  RFC3108 does not address cases
   where ATM serves as a low-level transport pipe for IP packets which
   in turn can carry one or more real-time (e.g.  VoIP) media sessions
   with a life-cycle different from that of the underlying ATM
   transport.

                        6.3 RFC3890 bwtype Analysis

   NOTE: The intention of TIAS is that the media level bit-rate is
   multiplied with the known per-packet overhead for the selected
   transport and the maxprate value to determine the worst case bit-rate
   from the transport to more accurately capture the required usage.
   Summing TIAS values independently across "m=" lines and multiplying
   the computed sum with maxprate and the per-packet overhead would
   inflate the value significantly.  Instead performing multiplication
   and adding the individual values is a more appropriate usage.

   [RFC6285] describes a method using the existing RTP and RTCP
   machinery that reduces the acquisition delay.  In this method, an
   auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the Reference Information to
   the receiver precedes or accompanies the multicast stream.  This
   unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a faster than natural bitrate
   to further accelerate the acquisition.  The motivating use case for
   this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time
   compressed audio and video.

   mechanism.  It defines a new RTCP Extended Report (XR) block for
   periodic ECN feedback, a new RTCP transport feedback message for
   timely reporting of congestion events, and a STUN extension used in
   the optional initialization method using ICE.

7.5.  RFC6642: Third-Party Loss Report

   In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
   [RFC4585], a feedback target may experience transient overload if
   some event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at
   once.  This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback
   reports are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid
   sending duplicate feedback reports.  However, there are cases where
   it is not recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow
   feedback implosion.  [RFC6642] memo discusses these cases and defines
   a new RTCP Third-Party Loss Report that can be used to inform
   receivers that the feedback target is aware of some loss event,
   allowing them to suppress feedback.  Associated SDP signaling is also
   defined.

   [RFC5109] describes a payload format for generic Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on
   the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format allows end
   systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and
   levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt
   to different media and channel characteristics.  It enables complete
   recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical
   parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.

14.  Multiplexing Considerations for Encapsulating Attributes

   This sections deals with recommendations for defining the
   multiplexing characteristics of the SDP attributes that encapsulate
   other SDP attributes/parameters.  Such attributes as of today, for
   example, are defined in [RFC3407], [RFC5939] and [RFC6871] as part of
   a generic framework for indicating and negotiating transport, media,
   and media format related capabilities in the SDP.

   The behavior of such attributes under multiplexing is in turn defined
   by the multiplexing behavior of the attributes they encapsulate which

   are made known once the Offer/Answer negotiation process is
   completed.

14.1.  RFC3407: cpar Attribute Analysis

   [RFC3407] capability parameter attribute (a=cpar) encapsulates b=
   (bandwidth) or an a= attribute.  For bandwidth attribute
   encapsulation, the category SUM is inherited.  For the case of a=
   attribute, the category corresponding to the SDP attribute being
   encapsulated is inherited.

    a=fmtp:100 max-fr=15;max-fs=1200
    a=cdsc: 2 video RTP/AVP 101
    a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux

   In the above example,the category IDENTICAL is inherited for the cpar
   encapsulated rtcp-mux attribute.

14.2.  RFC5939 Analysis

   [RFC5939] defines a general SDP capability negotiation framework.  It
   also specifies how to provide transport protocols and SDP attributes
   as capabilities and negotiate them using the framework.

   For this purpose, [RFC5939] defines the following

   o  A set of capabilities for the session and its associated media
      stream components, supported by each side.  The attribute
      ("a=acap") defines how to list an attribute name and its
      associated value (if any) as a capability.  The attribute
      ("a=tcap") defines how to list transport protocols (e.g., "RTP/
      AVP") as capabilities.

   o  A set of potential configurations ("a=pcfg") provided by the
      offerer to indicate which combinations of those capabilities can
      be used for the session and its associated media stream

      components.  Potential configurations are not ready for use until
      fully negotiated.  They provide an alternative that MAY be used,
      subject to SDP capability negotiation procedures.  In particular
      the answerer MAY choose one of the potential configurations for
      use as part of the current Offer/Answer exchange.

   o  An actual configuration ("a=acfg") for the session and its
      associated media stream components.  The actual configuration
      identifies the potential configuration that was negotiated for
      use.  Use of an actual configuration does not require any further
      negotiation.

   o  A negotiation process that takes the current actual and the set of
      potential configurations (combinations of capabilities) as input
      and provides the negotiated actual configurations as output.  In
      [RFC5939] the negotiation process is done independently for each
      media description.

14.2.1.  Recommendation: Procedures for Potential Configuration Pairing

   This section provides recommendations for entities generating and
   processing SDP under the generic capability negotiation framework as
   defined in [RFC5939] under the context of media stream multiplexing.

   These recommendations are provided for the purposes of enabling the
   Offerer to make sure that the generated potential configurations
   between the multiplexed streams can (easily) be negotiated to be
   consistent between those streams.  In particular, the procedures aim
   to simplify Answerer's procedure to choose potential configurations
   that are consistent across all the multiplexed media descriptions.

   A potential configuration selects a set of attributes and parameters
   that become part of the media description when negotiated.  When
   multiplexing media descriptions with potential configurations
   specified, there MAY be a need for coordinating this selection
   between multiplexed media descriptions to ensure the right
   multiplexing behavior.

   Although it is possible to analyze the various potential
   configurations in multiplexed media descriptions to find combinations
   that satisfy such constraints, it can quickly become complicated to
   do so.

   The procedures defined in [RFC5939] state that each potential
   configuration in the SDP has a unique configuration number, however
   the scope of uniqueness is limited to each media description.  To
   make it simple for the answerer to chose valid combinations of
   potential configurations across media descriptions in a given bundle

   group, we provide a simple rule for constructing potential
   configurations

   o  Let m-bundle be the set of media descriptions that form a given
      bundle .

   o  Let m-bundle-pcfg be the set of media descriptions in m-bundle
      that include one or more potential configurations.

   o  Each media description in m-bundle-pcfg MUST have at least one
      potential configuration with the same configuration number (e.g.
      "1").

   o  For each potential configuration with configuration number x in m-
      bundle-pcfg, the offerer MUST ensure that if the answerer chooses
      configuration number x in each of the media descriptions in m-
      bundle-pcfg, then the resulting SDP will have all multiplexing
      constraints satisfied for those media descriptions.

   o  Since it is nearly impossible to define a generic mechanism for
      various capability extensions, this document does't provide
      procedures for dealing with the capability extension attributes.
      However, Section 14.3 provide analysis of media capability
      extension attributes as defined in [RFC6871].

   The above allows the answerer to easily find multiplexing compatible
   combinations of potential configurations: The answerer simply choses
   a potential configuration (number) that is present in all of the
   media descriptions with potential configurations in the bundle.

   Note that it is still possible for the offerer to provide additional
   potential configurations with independent configuration numbers.  The
   answerer will have to perform more complicated analysis to determine
   valid multiplexed combinations of those.

   repeated while referring to attribute capability a=rtcp-mux, since
   the behavior is IDENTICAL for the attribute a=rtcp-mux under
   multiplexing.

14.3.  RFC6871 Analysis

   [RFC6871] extends the capability negotiation framework described in
   [RFC5939] by defining media capabilities that can be used to indicate
   and negotiate media types and their associated format parameters.  It
   also allows indication of latent configurations and session
   capabilities.

14.3.1.  Recommendation: Dealing with Payload Type Numbers

   [RFC6871] defines a new payload type ("pt") parameter to be used with
   the potential, actual, and latent configuration parameters.  The
   parameter associates RTP payload type numbers with the referenced
   RTP-based media format capabilities ("a=rmcap") defined in [RFC6871]
   and is appropriate only when the transport protocol uses RTP.  This
   means that the same payload type number can be assigned as part of
   potential or actual configurations in different media descriptions in
   a bundle.  There are rules for the usage of identical Payload Type
   values across multiplexed "m=" lines as described in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation], which must be followed here
   as well.  As described in Section 14.2.1, the use of identical
   configuration numbers for compatible configurations in different
   media descriptions that are part of the bundle provides a way to
   ensure that the answerer can easily pick compatible configurations
   here as well.

14.3.1.1.  Example: Attribute Capability Under Shared Payload Type

   The attributes (a=rmcap, a=mfcap) follow the above recommendations
   under multiplexing.

   a=pcfg:1 m=4 pt=4:97
   a=pcfg:4 m=5 pt=5:101


   In the example above, the potential configuration number "1" is
   repeated when referring to media and media format capability used for
   the Payload Type 96.  This implies that both the media capability 2
   and 4 along with their media format capabilities MUST refer to the
   same codec configuration, as per the definition of IDENTICAL-PER-PT.

14.3.2.  Recommendation: Dealing with Latent Configurations

   [RFC6871] adds the notion of a latent configurations, which provides
   configuration information that may be used to guide a subsequent
   offer/exchange, e.g. by adding another media stream or use
   alternative codec combinations not currently offered.  Latent
   configurations have configuration numbers which cannot overlap with
   the potential configuration numbers [RFC6871].  Supported
   combinations of potential and latent configurations are indicated by
   use of the "a=sescap" attribute, however use of this attribute is not
   recommended with multiplexed media, since it requires the use of
   unique configuration numbers across the SDP.  Taken together, this
   means there is no well-defined way to indicate supported combinations

   of latent configurations, or combinations of latent and potential
   configurations with multiplexed media.  It is still allowed to use
   the latent configuration attribute, however the limitations above
   will apply.  To determine valid combinations, actual negotiation will
   have to be attempted subsequently instead.

15.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFCXXXX with the RFC number of this
   document.]

   Section 15.1 defines a new subregistry to be added by the IANA for
   identifying the initial registrations for various multiplexing
   categories applicable, as proposed in this document.

   IANA is also requested to add a new column named "Mux Category" to
   several of the subregistries in the "Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The tables in Section 15.2 identify name
   of an entry in the existing subregistry and specify the value to be
   put in the new "Mux Category" column of the associated IANA registry.

15.1.  New 'Multiplexing Categories' subregistry

   A new sub-registry needs to be defined called the "Multiplexing
   Categories", with the following registrations created initially:
   "NORMAL", "CAUTION", "IDENTICAL", "TRANSPORT", "SUM", "INHERIT",
   "IDENTICAL-PER-PT", "SPECIAL" and "TBD" as defined in this document.

   Initial value registration for "Multiplexing Categories".

   +-------------------------+-----------+
   | Multiplexing Categories | Reference |
   +-------------------------+-----------+
   | NORMAL                  | RFCXXXX   |
   | CAUTION                 | RFCXXXX   |
   | IDENTICAL               | RFCXXXX   |
   | TRANSPORT               | RFCXXXX   |
   | SUM                     | RFCXXXX   |
   | INHERIT                 | RFCXXXX   |
   | IDENTICAL-PER-PT        | RFCXXXX   |
   | SPECIAL                 | RFCXXXX   |
   | TBD                     | RFCXXXX   |
   +-------------------------+-----------+

   Further entries can be registered using Standard Actions policies
   outlined in [RFC5226], which requires IESG review and approval and
   standards-track IETF RFC publication.

   Each registration needs to indicate the multiplexing category value
   to be added to the "Multiplexing Categories" subregistry as defined
   in this section.

   Such a registration MUST also indicate the applicability of the newly
   defined multiplexing category value to various subregistries defined
   at the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.

15.2.  'Mux Category' column for subregistries

   Each sub-section identifies a subregistry in the "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The tables list the column that
   identifies the SDP attribute name/Token/Value from the corresponding
   subregistries and the values to be used for the new "Mux Category"
   column to be added.

   For the entries in the existing subregistries, under the "Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry, that lack a value
   for the "Mux Category" in this specification will get a value of
   "TBD".

   The registration policy for updates to the 'Mux Category' column
   values for existing parameters, or when registering new parameters,
   are beyond the scope of this document.  The registration policy for
   the affected table is defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis].

15.2.1.  Table: SDP bwtype

   The following values are to be added to the 'SDP bwtype' subregistry
   in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The

16.  Security Considerations

   The primary security for RTP including the way it is used here is
   described in [RFC3550] and [RFC3711].

   When multiplexing SDP attributes with the category "CAUTION", the
   implementations should be aware of possible issues as described in
   this specification.
