                  Enhanced Duplicate Address Detection
                    draft-ietf-6man-enhanced-dad-11

Abstract

   IPv6 Loopback Suppression and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) are
   discussed in Appendix A of RFC4862.  That specification mentions a
   hardware-assisted mechanism to detect looped back DAD messages.  If
   hardware cannot suppress looped back DAD messages, a software
   solution is required.  Several service provider communities have
   expressed a need for automated detection of looped back Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) messages used by DAD.  This document includes
   mitigation techniques and outlines the Enhanced DAD algorithm to
   automate the detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used by DAD.
   For network loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm allows IPv6 to
   self-heal after a loopback is placed and removed.  Further, for
   certain access networks the document automates resolving a specific
   duplicate address conflict.  This document updates RFC4861, RFC4862,
   and RFC3971.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Loopback Suppression and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) are
   discussed in Appendix A of [RFC4862].  That specification mentions a
   hardware-assisted mechanism to detect looped back DAD messages.  If
   hardware cannot suppress looped back DAD messages, a software
   solution is required.  One specific DAD message is the Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS), specified in [RFC4861].  The NS is issued by the
   network interface of an IPv6 node for DAD.  Another message involved
   in DAD is the Neighbor Advertisement (NA).  The Enhanced DAD
   algorithm specified in this document focuses on detecting an NS
   looped back to the transmitting interface during the DAD operation.

   Detecting a looped back NA does not solve the looped back DAD
   problem.  Detection of any other looped back ND messages during the
   DAD operation is outside the scope of this document.  This document
   also includes a section on Mitigation that discusses means already
   available to mitigate the DAD loopback problem.  This document
   updates RFC4861, RFC4862, and RFC3971.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   o  DAD-failed state - Duplication Address Detection failure as
      specified in [RFC4862].  Note even Optimistic DAD as specified in
      [RFC4429] can fail due to a looped back DAD probe.  This document
      covers looped back detection for Optimistic DAD as well.

   o  Looped back message - also referred to as a reflected message.
      The message sent by the sender is received by the sender due to
      the network or an Upper Layer Protocol on the sender looping the
      message back.

   o  Loopback - A function in which the router's layer-3 interface (or
      the circuit to which the router's interface is connected) is
      looped back or connected to itself.  Loopback causes packets sent
      by the interface to be received by the interface and results in
      interface unavailability for regular data traffic forwarding.  See
      more details in section 9.1 of [RFC2328].  The Loopback function
      is commonly used in an interface context to gain information on
      the quality of the interface, by employing mechanisms such as
      ICMPv6 pings and bit-error tests.  In a circuit context, this
      function is used in wide area environments including optical Dense
      Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and SONET/SDH for fault
      isolation (e.g. by placing a loopback at different geographic
      locations along the path of a wide area circuit to help locate a
      circuit fault).  The Loopback function may be employed locally or
      remotely.

   o  NS(DAD) - shorthand notation to denote an Neighbor Solicitation
      (NS) (as specified in [RFC4861]) with unspecified IPv6 source-
      address issued during DAD.

2.  Problem Statement

   Recently, service providers have reported a problem with DAD that
   arises under the following sets of circumstances: In the first,
   loopback testing for troubleshooting purposes is underway on a
   circuit connected to an IPv6-enabled interface on a router.  The
   interface issues a NS for the IPv6 link-local address DAD.  The NS is
   reflected back to the router interface due to the loopback condition
   of the circuit, and the router interface enters a DAD-failed state.
   After the loopback condition is removed, IPv4 will return to
   operation without further manual intervention.  However, IPv6 will
   remain in DAD-failed state until manual intervention on the router
   restores IPv6 to operation.  In the second scenario, two broadband
   modems are served by the same service provider and terminate to the
   same layer-3 interface on an IPv6-enabled access concentrator.  In
   this case, the two modems' Ethernet interfaces are also connected to
   a common local network (collision domain).  The access concentrator
   serving the modems is the first-hop IPv6 router for the modems and
   issues a NS(DAD) message for the IPv6 link-local address of its
   layer-3 interface.  The NS message reaches one modem first and this
   modem sends the message to the local network, where the second modem
   receives the message and then forwards it back to the access
   concentrator.  The looped back NS message causes the network
   interface on the access concentrator to be in a DAD-failed state.
   Such a network interface typically serves thousands of broadband
   modems, and all would have their IPv6 connectivity affected until the
   DAD-failed state is cleared.  Additionally, it may be difficult for
   the user of the access concentrator to determine the source of the
   looped back DAD message.  Thus in order to avoid IPv6 outages that
   can potentially affect multiple users, there is a need for automated
   detection of looped back NS messages during DAD operations by a node.

   Note: In both examples above, the IPv6 link-local address DAD
   operation fails due to a looped back DAD probe.  However, the problem
   of a looped back DAD probe exists for any IPv6 address type including
   global addresses.

3.  Operational Mitigation Options

   Two mitigation options are described below that do not require any
   change to existing implementations.

3.1.  Disable DAD on an Interface

   One can disable DAD on an interface so that there are no NS(DAD)
   messages issued.  While this mitigation may be the simplest, the
   mitigation has three drawbacks: 1) care is needed when making such
   configuration changes on point-to-point interfaces, 2) this is a one-



Asati, et al.             Expires July 18, 2015                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                Enhanced DAD                  January 2015


   time manual configuration on each interface, and 3) genuine
   duplicates on the link will not be detected.

   A Service Provider router, such as an access concentrator, or network
   core router, SHOULD support this mitigation strategy.

3.2.  Dynamic Disable/Enable of DAD Using Layer-2 Protocol

   Some layer-2 protocols include provisions to detect the existence of
   a loopback on an interface circuit, usually by comparing protocol
   data sent and received.  For example, the Point-to-Point Protocol
   (PPP) uses a magic number (section 6.4 of [RFC1661]) to detect a
   loopback on an interface.

   When a layer-2 protocol detects that a loopback is present on an
   interface circuit, the device MUST temporarily disable DAD on the
   interface.  When the protocol detects that a loopback is no longer
   present (or the interface state has changed), the device MUST
   (re-)enable DAD on that interface.

   This mitigation has several benefits.  It leverages the layer-2
   protocol's built-in loopback detection capability, if available.  It
   scales better since it relies on an event-driven model which requires
   no additional state or timer.  This may be significant on devices
   with hundreds or thousands of interfaces that may be in loopback for
   long periods of time (e.g., awaiting turn-up).

   This solution SHOULD be enabled by default, and MUST be a
   configurable option if the layer-2 technology provides means for
   detecting loopback messages on an interface circuit.

3.3.  Operational Considerations

   The mitigation options discussed above do not require the devices on
   both ends of the circuit to support the mitigation functionality
   simultaneously, and do not propose any capability negotiation.  They
   are effective for unidirectional circuit or interface loopback (i.e.
   the the loopback is placed in one direction on the circuit, rendering
   the other direction non-operational), but they may not be effective
   for a bidirectional loopback (i.e. the loopback is placed in both
   directions of the circuit interface, so as to identify the faulty
   segment).  This is because unless both ends followed a mitigation
   option specified in this document, the non-compliant device would
   follow current behavior and disable IPv6 on that interface due to DAD
   until manual intervention restores it.

4.  The Enhanced DAD Algorithm

   The Enhanced DAD algorithm covers detection of a looped back NS(DAD)
   message.  The document proposes use of a random number in the Nonce
   Option specified in SEND [RFC3971].  Note [RFC3971] does not provide
   a recommendation for pseudo-random functions.  Pseudo-random
   functions are covered in [RFC4086].  Since a nonce is used only once,
   the NS(DAD) for each IPv6 address of an interface uses a different
   nonce.  Additional details of the algorithm are included in section
   4.2.

   If there is a collision because two nodes using the same Target
   Address in their NS(DAD) and generated the same random nonce, then
   the algorithm will incorrectly detect a looped back NS(DAD) when a
   genuine address collision has occurred.  Since each looped back
   NS(DAD) event is logged to system management, the administrator of
   the network will have access to the information necessary to
   intervene manually.  Also, because the nodes will have detected what
   appear to be looped back NS(DAD) messages, they will continue to
   probe, and it is unlikely that they will choose the same nonce the
   second time (assuming quality random number generators).

   The algorithm is capable of detecting any ND solicitation (NS and
   Router Solicitation) or advertisement (NA and Router Advertisement)
   that is looped back.  However, there may be increased implementation
   complexity and memory usage for the sender node to store a nonce and
   nonce related state for all ND messages.  Therefore, this document
   does not recommend using the algorithm outside of the DAD operation
   by an interface on a node.

4.1.  Processing Rules for Senders

   If a node has been configured to use the Enhanced DAD algorithm, when
   sending an NS(DAD) for a tentative or optimistic interface address
   the sender MUST generate a random nonce associated with the interface
   address, MUST store the nonce internally, and MUST include the nonce
   in the Nonce Option included in the NS(DAD).  If the interface does
   not receive any DAD failure indications within RetransTimer
   milliseconds (see [RFC4861]) after having sent DupAddrDetectTransmits
   Neighbor Solicitations, the interface moves the Target Address to the
   assigned state.

   If any probe is looped back within RetransTimer milliseconds after
   having sent DupAddrDetectTransmits NS(DAD) messages, the interface
   continues with another MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT number of NS(DAD)
   messages transmitted RetransTimer milliseconds apart.  Section 2 of
   [RFC3971] defines a single-use nonce, so each Enhanced DAD probe uses
   a different nonce.  If no probe is looped back within RetransTimer

Internet-Draft                Enhanced DAD                  January 2015


   milliseconds after MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT NS(DAD) messages are sent,
   the probing stops.  The probing MAY be stopped via manual
   intervention.  When probing is stopped, the interface moves the
   Target Address to the assigned state.

4.2.  Processing Rules for Receivers

   If the node has been configured to use the Enhanced DAD algorithm and
   an interface on the node receives any NS(DAD) message where the
   Target Address matches the interface address (in tentative or
   optimistic state), the receiver compares the nonce included in the
   message, with any stored nonce on the receiving interface.  If a
   match is found, the node SHOULD log a system management message,
   SHOULD update any statistics counter, and MUST drop the received
   message.  If the received NS(DAD) message includes a nonce and no
   match is found with any stored nonce, the node SHOULD log a system
   management message for a DAD-failed state, and SHOULD update any
   statistics counter.

4.3.  Changes to RFC 4861

   The following text is appended to the RetransTimer variable
   description in section 6.3.2 of [RFC4861]:

   The RetransTimer MAY be overridden by a link-specific document if a
   node supports the Enhanced DAD algorithm.

   The following text is appended to the Source Address definition in
   section 4.3 of [RFC4861]:

   If a node has been configured to use the Enhanced DAD algorithm, an
   NS with an unspecified source address adds the Nonce option to the
   message and implements the state machine of the Enhanced DAD
   algorithm.

5.  Actions to Perform on Detecting a Genuine Duplicate

   As described in the paragraphs above, the nonce can also serve to
   detect genuine duplicates even when the network has potential for
   looping back ND messages.  When a genuine duplicate is detected, the
   node follows the manual intervention specified in section 5.4.5 of
   [RFC4862].  However, in certain cases, if the genuine duplicate
   matches the tentative or optimistic IPv6 address of a network
   interface of the access concentrator, additional automated actions
   are recommended.

   Some networks follow a trust model where a trusted router serves un-
   trusted IPv6 host nodes.  Operators of such networks have a desire to



Asati, et al.             Expires July 18, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                Enhanced DAD                  January 2015


   take automated action if a network interface of the trusted router
   has a tentative or optimistic address duplicated by a host.  One
   example of a type of access network is cable broadband deployment
   where the access concentrator is the first-hop IPv6 router to
   multiple broadband modems and supports proxying of DAD messages.  The
   network interface on the access concentrator initiates DAD for an
   IPv6 address and detects a genuine duplicate due to receiving an
   NS(DAD) or an NA message.  On detecting such a duplicate, the access
   concentrator SHOULD log a system management message, drop the
   received ND message, and block the modem on whose layer-2 service
   identifier the duplicate NS(DAD) or NA message was received on.  Any
   other network that follows the same trust model MAY use the automated
   actions proposed in this section.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not improve nor reduce the security posture of
   [RFC4862].  The nonce can be exploited by a rogue deliberately
   changing the nonce to fail the looped back detection specified by the
   Enhanced DAD algorithm.  SEND is recommended to circumvent this
   exploit.  Additionally, the nonce does not protect against the DoS
   caused by a rogue node replying by a fake NA to all DAD probes.  SEND
   is recommended to circumvent this exploit also.  Disabling DAD has an
   obvious security issue before a remote node on the link can issue
   reflected NS(DAD) messages.  Again, SEND is recommended for this
   exploit.  Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) [RFC6620] also
   protects against various attacks by on-link rogues.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
