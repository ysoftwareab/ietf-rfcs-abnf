Abstract

   TLS session ticket provides a stateless mechanism for server to
   resume connection with client.  As per TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], server
   always sends arbitary number of session ticket after handshake.  This
   document introduces a new message which is TicketRequest message, it
   can be send by client after handshake at any point of connection
   lifetime to retrieve session ticket.  The proposed mechanism in this
   document is only for TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3 and future versions.

1.  Introduction

   As per TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], TLS server sends arbitary number of session
   ticket after handshake (or after post-handshake authentication).
   Such session tickets are needed only for a client which resumes
   parallel connections to server immediately.  But this delays the
   application data processing for a client which is not going to resume
   parallel connections immediately.  Such clients might need session
   ticket at later point of time or it may not need also.

   So a client's need based session ticket generation will be more
   efficient on both server and client.

   To achieve this a new TicketRequest message is proposed in this
   specification, which should be send by client as and when it needs
   session ticket for resumption.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

2.  SessionTicket Generation

   Client should be able to retrieve session ticket from server in two
   ways

   o  As per [RFC8446] immediately after handshake or after post-
      handshake authentication.

   o  By sending TicketRequest message to server at later time during
      data transfer.

   A new ticket_request extension [I-D.ietf-tls-ticketrequests] has been
   proposed to give control over client to request the amount of session
   ticket it needs for resuming parallel connection immediately after
   handshake.

   This extension SHOULD be send by client with
   TicketRequestContents.count as zero, if it does not need to resume
   parallel connection immediately after handshake.  Then it can use
   TicketRequest message at later point when it needs to resume
   connection.

   A client can send any number of TicketRequest message in its
   connection lifetime with server.  But server SHOULD limit the total
   number of ticket issued to client per connection to prevent DOS
   attack.

3.  TicketRequest Message

   TicketRequest message send by client holds the count parameter, which
   indicates how much session ticket immediately client needs.

   Structure of this message:

   struct {
       uint8 count;
   } TicketRequest;

   count  The number of tickets needed by client

4.  IANA Considerations

   Needs to register new TLS message type TicketRequest in IANA

5.  Security Considerations

   The amount of ticket requested per connection should be limited by
   threshold value at server to prevent DOS attack.
