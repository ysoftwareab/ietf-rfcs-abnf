Abstract

     This document describes a mechanism by which an appropriate
     ringback tone may be played to the calling party when the called
     party's device is alerting. It is written specifcally to address
     the case where the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used to
     initiate voice-over-IP calls. It also lists ringback
     characteristics for several countries.

1. Introduction

     In the current PSTN (public switched telephony network), users
     expect to hear an appropriate ringback tone when contacting a
     node in a foreign network. For example, when placing a call from
     the United States to Sweden, a Swedish ringback tone is heard by
     the caller.

     Further, it is currently possible that calls terminating on a PBX
     exchange receive special ringback tones which are distinct from
     those used by the PSTN in the country in which the PBX resides.

Internet Draft   Ringback tones in SIP-Based Telephony     November 2000



     In order to ease the transition from standard circuit-switched
     telephony to voice-over-IP telephony, it is desirable that, when
     feasable, user experience remains largely the same. In the case
     of providing an appropriate ringback tone, doing so is quite
     trivial.

     This document defines two extension headers to SIP [1] to allow
     such behavior. The first, "Country," specifies the country in
     which the called party is located. The second, "Ringback," allows
     the called party to give an specific frequency and cadence for
     the ringback tone. Both headers are expected to be included only
     in "180 Ringing" responses to "INVITE" requests.

2. Client Handling

     If a SIP UAS (called party) wishes to suggest that a specific
     ringback tone be played to the calling party, it may include one
     or both of the "Country" or "Ringback" headers (defined below) in
     its "180 Ringing" responses to "INVITE" requests. For robust
     operation, it is strongly recommended that UASs wishing to use
     this extension include both headers.

     UACs (calling party agents) may elect to implement either or both
     of the "Ringback" and "Country" headers (although, for robustness
     sake, are encouraged to implement both). Note that low-memory
     embedded devices may not have the luxury of storing ringtone
     information for scores of countries; similarly, many clients may
     choose not to parse out the slightly more complicated "Ringback"
     syntax and instead opt to use the "Country" header exclusively.

     When a UAC (calling party) understanding either or both of the
     "Country" and "Ringback" headers receives them in a "180 Ringing"
     message, it can use them to generate an approprite ringback tone
     for the calling user. In the case that only a "Country" header is
     present, the ringback tone is that defined in section 4. When a
     "Ringback" header is present, it will define a specific tone
     (frequency and cadence) to be played to the calling user.

     In the case that the UAC understands both headers, "Ringback" is
     expected to take precedence over "Country." This allows the
     definition of custom ringback tones (e.g. for special PBX
     ringback).

     It is suggested that nodes implementing the extension described
     in this document also implement the "Reliability of Provisional
     Responses in SIP" extension [6] ; this will ensure delivery of
     the "180 Ringing" response.

2.1. New SIP headers

     This table expands on tables 4 and 5  in RFC 2543 [1] .

     Header field         where  proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG
     ---------------------------------------------------------
     Country               180          -   -   -   o   -   -
     Ringback              180          -   -   -   o   -   -


2.1.1. SIP "Country" Header

     The following SIP header is defined.

     Country      =  "Country" ":" country-code
     country-code =  2(lower-case)
     lower-case   =  %x61-7a ; lowercase letters a-z


     This header is used to convey which country-specific ringback
     tone is to be presented to the calling party. The defined values
     for "country-code" and their corresponding ringback tone
     definitions are given in section 4.

     Note that the "Country" header may be generally useful in other
     situations which are outside the scope of this document. Draft
     authors are encouraged to reuse the "Country" header where
     appropriate. The syntax and accepted values (based on ISO 3166
     [3] and the IANA TLD list [2] ) are expected remain the largely
     the same, with the possible addition of parameters when needed
     (e.g. "Country: gb;subdivision=sct").

2.1.2. SIP "Ringback" Header

     The following SIP header is defined.

     Ringback     =  "Ringback" ":" frequency ";" cadence
     frequency    =  1*DIGIT [("x" | "+") 1*DIGIT]
     cadence      =  duration ";" duration *(";" duration ";" duration)
     duration     =  1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT]


     When present, this header gives a specific definition of the
     ringback tone to be played for the calling party.

     The "frequency" parameter specifies the tone to be played. All
     frequency numbers represent a sine-wave frequency in hertz.

     If the frequency paremeter contins a single number, it represents
     a pure tone to be played. If a frequency of the format "f1 + f2"
     is specified, both frequencies f1 and f2  should be played



Roach                                                           [Page 3]

Internet Draft   Ringback tones in SIP-Based Telephony     November 2000


     simultaneously to generate the tone. If a frequency of the format
     "f1 x f2" is speficied, the frequency f1 should be modulated by
     the frequency f2 to generate the tone.

     The remaining numbers in the "Ringback" header represent the
     cadence at which the tone is to be played. There must always be
     an even number of cadence parameters; clients receiving an odd
     number of cadence parameters are expected to ignore the
     "Ringback" header as malformed. The first cadence parameter is a
     decimal duration, in seconds, for which the tone is to be played.
     The second parameter is a duration, in seconds, which should be
     paused before playing the tone again. Third and subsequent
     parameters specify additional on/off periods for the tone. All
     ringtone patterns repeat.

2.2. Alternate Handling

     If no "Country" or "Ringback" header is present, clients
     implementing this extension may choose to make an intellegent
     guess about the called party's country.

     If the "180 Ringing" message contains a "Contact" header using a
     symbolic name (i.e. resolvable by DNS), the client takes note of
     the top-level-domain of this contact address for the processing
     described below. If the "Contact" header contains an IP address,
     the client may attempt to perform a DNS lookup on this IP address
     to determine the top-level-domain for its preferred name.

     If a top-level-domain could not be determined from the "Contact"
     header, the same series of steps is applied to the address in the
     "To" header.

     If a country-specific top-level-domain can be determined via the
     steps above, the client will play the ringtone matching this
     country (as if it had been specified in a "Country" header). Note
     that the country-specific top-level-domain "uk" should be treated
     the same as "gb."

     If a non-country-specific top-level-domain is determined, it is
     suggested that the client play one of: the ringback tone local to
     the calling party, North American ringback tone (see section
     4.165. ), or a generic ringback tone meeting the requirements
     described in ITU-T E.180 [4] (e.g. 425 Hz at a cadence of 1
     second on, 4 seconds off). It would be appropriate to allow the
     user to select between these three modes of operation to suit
     personal preferences.

3. Proxy Handling

     No special proxy handling is required by this extension.

4. Ringtone Characteristics by Country

     This section provides a reference for relevant information about
     a number of countries. "Code" is the two-letter "country-code"
     token to be used in the "Country:" header. "Frequency" describes
     the frequency/frequencies which compose(s) the ringback tone, and
     the remaining information describes the cadence of the ringback
     tone.

     The two-letter country codes in this section are largely aligned
     which those published in ISO 3166 [3] , with some minor additions
     from the IANA document "Root-Zone Whois Information" [2] for
     practical considerations.

     The ringback tones and cadences are beleived to be the most
     common form of ringback tone in the associated country, as
     published in Suppliment 2 to ITU-T E.180 [5] .

5. Example Messages

     This section provides a collection of SIP messages which
     demonstrate the various uses of the "Country:" and "Ringback:"
     headers.

5.1. Dual-Tone Ringback

     This is an example of how a message might look for a standard
     two-tone ringback. In this example, both a country code of "us"
     and the standard US ringtone are specified.

     From: <sip:ake.svensson@ericsson.se>;tag=012345
     Call-ID: cmk2109fj@ws17.ericsson.se
     CSeq: 397 INVITE
     Via: SIP/2.0/UDP fw.ericsson.se
     Via: SIP/2.0/UDP ws17.ericsson.se
     Country: us
     Ringback: 440+480;2;4
     Content-Length: 0


5.2. Modulated Ringback

     This is almost identical to the previous example, with the
     exception that Australian ringback is being provided. This
     demonstrates the syntax for modulated ringback tones.

     Call-ID: 13098jv@b04a24.ericsson.com
     CSeq: 32849 INVITE
     Via: SIP/2.0/UDP b04a24.ericsson.com
     Country: au
     Ringback: 400x17;0.4;0.2;0.4;2
     Content-Length: 0


5.3. Continuous Ringtone

     Some localities provide an continuous ringtone, which indicates
     that there is no pause in the tone whatsoever. The suggested
     syntax for encoding such a ringtone is to provide an "off" period
     of 0.

     Country: tz
     Ringback: 400;1;0
     Content-Length: 0


5.4. No "Ringback" specified

     This is an example of a message which specifies no particular
     ringtone pattern. If the calling party client understands the
     country code of "gb," it will provide the proper ringback tone;
     otherwise, it will provide default handling.

     Country: gb
     Content-Length: 0


5.5. Special PBX double-ring ringback

     This message gives an example in which the default ringtone for
     the country should be overridden (e.g. because the call has
     terminated on a PBX). The "Country" header is still provided so
     that clients not implementing the "Ringback" header can still
     provided a regionalised dialtone.

Internet Draft   Ringback tones in SIP-Based Telephony     November 2000


     This message gives an example in which the specific ringback tone
     has been provided, but no country. Clients not implementing the
     "Ringback" header will treat this as a normal "Ringing" message.

7. Security Considerations

     Note that user location (including information as broad as
     "country") may be considered private information. As such, the
     user should have direct control over the presence and value of
     the "Country:" header.
