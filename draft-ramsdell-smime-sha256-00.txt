1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   In light of recent developments with the SHA-1 algorithm, this
   document describes the use of SHA-256.

3.  Changes to the S/MIME message specification

   The following changes are made to [RFC3851]

   The notation for SHOULD+ and MUST- needs to be added.

   The first sentence of section 2.1 is changed to read:

   Sending and receiving agents MUST- support SHA-1 [CMSALG] and SHOULD+
   support SHA-256 [SHA256].

   The following paragraph is added as the second paragraph to section
   2.2:

   Sending and receiving agents SHOULD+ support sha256WithRSAEncryption
   [SHA256].

   The last paragraph of section 2.2 needs some serious rework.

   The reference for [SHA256] needs to point to [RFC4055].

4.  Changes to the S/MIME certificate handling specification

   The following changes should be made to [RFC3850]

   The notation for SHOULD+ and MUST- needs to be added.

   Section 4.3 paragraph 2 is changed to the following:

   A receiving agent MUST- be capable of verifying the signatures on
   certificates and CRLs made with md5WithRSAEncryption and
   sha1WithRSAEncryption signature algorithms with key sizes from 512
   bits to 2048 bits described in [CMSALG].  A receiving agent SHOULD+
   be capable of verifying the signatures on certificates and CRLs made
   with sha256WithRSAEncryption described in [SHA256].

   Rewrite of last paragraph of section 4.3 to include SHA-1 and MD5
   warnings?
