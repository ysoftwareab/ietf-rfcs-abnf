1. Abstract

   This draft describes the Contract Net Protocol (CNP) and suggests
   some ways it could be used to enhance macro and/or micro mobility
   protocols.  Specifically this draft focuses on how CNP could be used
   for AAA and QoS state transfer and handover negotiation in mobile IP
   networks.

2. Introduction

   The CONTRACT NET PROTOCOL (CNP) is a distributed interaction
   protocol for cooperative problem solving among agents [1][2]. CNP
   was born in the distributed AI community in the early 1980s.  In
   many respects, the distributed agent nature of mobile IP lends
   itself naturally to the application of CNP. 

   CNP is modeled after the contracting mechanism used by businesses to
   govern the exchange of goods and services.  In this draft we show
   that CNP can be applied to mobile IP and/or other micro-mobility
   proposals to provide a scalable, robust, and improved distributed
   handover negotiation mechanism. A CONTRACT NET provides a solution
   to the connection problem: i.e. finding an appropriate agent to work
   on a given task.

3. CNP Overview

   In CNP's most basic form there is a pair of agents where one acts as
   a manager and one acts as a contractor.  The dialogue takes place as
   follows:

       Manager (x)                      Contractor (y)
   -----------------------------------------------------
        |---------- (Call for Bids) ------>|
        |                                  |
        |<--------- (Bid) -----------------|
        |                                  |
        |---------- (Award Contract) ----->|
        |                                  |
        |<--------- (Bid Accept|Decline) --|  (Optional)
        |                                  |

   In the figure above we show only one contractor y.  In practical
   applications there could be dozens of cooperating agents involved in
   the bidding process.  Also, any agent can act as a manager and/or a
   contractor.  The protocol is very simple.  There is no negotiation,
   the contractor responds with an acceptance or refusal of the
   contract.

4. Applying CNP to Mobility

   In the micro-mobility model we use in this draft, we define the
   concept of a CALL ANCHOR.  The CALL ANCHOR functionality is moved
   during a handover from one ACCESS POINT to another.  The collection
   of all call anchors on any one access point are managed by a
   MICROMOBILITY AGENT residing on the access point, and one call
   anchor is present for each call managed by the micro-mobility agent. 

   When a Mobile Node or an Access Point desires a handover, the
   micromobility agent contructs a CONTRACT that identifies the mobile
   node and the call anchor attributes.  These attributes will
   typically include AP load metrics and link charactersists like
   compression settings, AAA parameters, and QoS requirements.  After
   the contract has been contructed it will be announced to all handoff
   candidates compatible with the anchored Mobile Node (it is assumed
   that these have been previously discovered and screened based on the
   MN's capabilities).  Some of the micro-mobility managers on each of
   the neighboring APs sends a BID back to the current call anchor. 
   Based on information in the bid, such as received signal strength of
   the mobile (for example), the contract is awarded to the best AP. 
   The award process moves the call anchor for this MN to the new AP. 

   EXAMPLE: 

     AP0                  Propsect       Propect       Propect
     Current Anchor       Anchor AP1     Anchor AP2    Anchor AP3
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     |-- (HORQST Contract) ->|               |              |  (1)
     |         \-------------|-------------->|              |
     |          \------------|---------------|------------->|
     |                       |               |              |
     |<-- (HOBID) -----------|               |              |  (2)
     |<---------(HO DECLINE) |---------------|              |
     |<----------------------|---(HOBID)-----|--------------|
     |                       |               |              |
     |---------(CONTRACT AWARD (ANCHOR TOSS) |------------->|  (3)
     |                       |               |              |

   In step (1), the micro mobility agent in AP0, sends a Handover
   Request Contract (HORQST) message to the the cooperating anchor
   handoff candidates: AP1, AP2, AP3.  We assume the the neighbor list
   of APs was automagically discovered during initialization and
   configuration operations (not discussed in this draft).  It is
   assumed that the link characteristics in use by the mobile (AAA,
   QoS) are part of the contract (possibly described in XML (see
   digression below)). 

   In step (2), AP1's micro-mobililty agent responds with a bid to

   handle the anchor as does AP3.  AP2 declines the contract. 

   In step (3), AP0 after comparing the bids (within a short fixed time
   period), awards the Handover contract to AP3 (the best AP for the
   job). 

   Clearly this method for handover negotiation is very scalable since
   it lives completely on the edge of the internet and uses a minimal
   set of messages.  The obvious question is how does it cooperate with
   mobile IP?  This is covered in the subsequent section. 

   DIGRESSION:  We suggest using XML as the message format for our CNP
   based micro-mobility messages. It is used by Internet Open Trading
   Protocol (IOTP) and handovers may one day tie in directly to various
   e-commerce systems.	It is a convenient way to build versioned and
   extensible messages like those we will need for link characteristic
   contract formation.  It will require a minimal XML parser to be
   present in the micro-mobility agent.

5. Running CNP with MIP

   Many implementations of CNP base micro-mobility running in
   conjunction with mobile IP are possible.  It may be desirable to
   place micro- mobility agents inside the mobile nodes as well as
   access points. This would allow mobile nodes to act as call anchors,
   gateways, and hop points in manet-like configurations.  For the rest
   of this draft we will assume only access point based micro-mobility
   agents. 

   MIPv4 would require the micro-mobility agent to understand the
   relationship between the mobile node and the foreign agent.  It may
   be possible for a micro-mobility agent to know a-priori which
   handoff neighbors require a FA change (possibly via a discovery
   process conducted with its anchor handoff propects).  By "knowing"
   that a new FA is required for the handover, the micro-mobility agent
   could orchestrate a fast, smooth, even make before break handover on
   behalf of the mobile (perhaps by proxying for the MN in some
   instances). 

   In MIPv6, the micro-mobility agent needs to understand the current
   care of address assigned to the mobile and the mobile node's home
   agent address.  When a new COA is required the agent can go get it
   before initiating performing the anchor toss. 

   Many other possibilities exist and I hope to describe some of these
   in subsequent versions of this draft.
