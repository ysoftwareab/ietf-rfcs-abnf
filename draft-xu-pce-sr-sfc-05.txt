          PCEP Extensions for Unifed Source Routing-based SFC
                         draft-xu-pce-sr-sfc-05

Abstract

   MPLS-SPRING (a.k.a., MPLS Segment Routing) could be leveraged to
   realize a unified source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6
   data planes by using a unified source routing instruction set while
   preserving backward compatibility with MPLS-SPRING.  More
   specifically, the source routing instruction set information
   contained in a source routed packet could be uniformly encoded as an
   MPLS label stack no matter the underlay is IPv4, IPv6 or MPLS.  The
   unified source routing mechanism could be leveraged to realize a
   transport-independent service function chaining by encoding the
   service function path information or service function chain
   information as an MPLS label stack.  This document describes
   extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow
   a PCE to compute and instantiate service function paths in the unifed
   source routing based service function chaining context.  The
   extensions specified in this document are applicable to both the
   stateless PCE model and the stateful PCE model.

1.  Introduction

   Service Function Chaining [RFC7665] provides a flexible way to
   construct services.  When applying a particular Service Function
   Chain (SFC) to the traffic classified by the Classifier, the traffic
   needs to be steered through an ordered set of Service Function
   Forwarders (SFF) and Service Functions (SF) in the network.  This
   ordered set of SFFs and SFs in the network, referred to as a Service
   Function Path (SFP), is an instantiation of the SFC in the network.
   For example, as shown in Figure 1, an SFP corresponding to the SFC of
   {SF1, SF3} can be expressed as {SFF1, SF1, SFF2, SF3}.

             Figure 1: PCE-based Service Function Chaining in MPLS-SR Network

   MPLS-SPRING (a.k.a., MPLS Segment Routing) could be leveraged to
   realize a unified source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6
   data planes by using a unified source routing instruction set while
   preserving backward compatibility with MPLS-SPRING as descried in
   [I-D.xu-mpls-unified-source-routing-instruction].  More specifically,
   the source routing instruction set information contained in a source
   routed packet could be uniformly encoded as an MPLS label stack no
   matter the underlay is IPv4, IPv6 or MPLS.  The unified source
   routing mechanism in turn could be leveraged to realize a transport-
   independent service function chaining by encoding the service
   function path information or service function chain information as an
   MPLS label stack as described in [I-D.xu-mpls-service-chaining].

   This document describes extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) that allow a PCE to compute and instantiate service
   function paths in the MPLS source routing based service function
   chaining context.  More specifically, the PCC provides an ordered
   list of SF IDs to the PCE and indicates to the PCE that what type SFs
   and paths are requested (e.g., an SFP, or a compact SFP, or an SR-
   specific SFP, or a compact SR-specific SFP) through the path
   computation request message, and then the PCE responds with a
   corresponding path through the path computation response message.

   The extensions specified in this document are applicable to both the
   stateless PCE model [RFC5440] and the stateful PCE model
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC5440],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] and [I-D.xu-mpls-service-chaining].
   In addition, this memo defines the following two additional terms:

      Compact SFP: An ordered list of SFFs.

      SR-specific SFP: An ordered list of node SIDs (representing SFFs)
      and Service Function SIDs.

      Compact SR-specific SFP: An ordered list of node SIDs
      (representing SFFs).

3.  PCEP Message Extensions for MPLS Source Routing-based SFC

3.1.  PCReq Message

   This document does not specify any changes to the PCReq message
   format.  This document requires the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV
   [I-D.ietf-pce-lsp-setup-type] to be carried in the RP Object in order
   for a PCC to request a particular type of path.  Four new Path Setup
   Types need to be defined for MPLS source routing-based SFC (see
   Section 4.2).  This document also requires the Include Route Object
   (IRO) to be carried in the PCReq message in order for a PCC to
   specify an SFC.  A new IRO sub-object type needs to be defined for SF
   (see Section 4.3).

3.2.  PCRep Message

   This document defines the format of the PCRep message carrying an
   SFP.  The message is sent by a PCE to a PCC in response to a
   previously received PCReq message, where the PCC requested an SFP.
   The format of the SFC-specific PCRep message is defined as follows:

              <PCRep Message>::=<Common Header>
                                <response-list>
                 Where:
                  <response-list>::=<response>[<response-list>]
                  <response>::=<RP>
                               [<NO-PATH>]
                               [<path-list>]
                  Where:
                   <path-list>::=<SR-SFC-ERO>[<path-list>]

Internet-Draft                                                 July 2017


   The RP and NO-PATH Objects are defined in [RFC5440].  The <SR-SFC-
   ERO> object contains an SFP and is defined in Section 4.4.

3.3.  PCUpd Message

   This document defines the format of the PCUpd message carrying an SFP
   update.  The message is sent forwardly by a PCE to a PCC to update an
   previously computed SFP.

   The format of the PCUpd message is defined as follows:

           <PCUpd Message>::=<Common Header>
                             <udpate-request-list>
           Where:
            <udpate-request-list>::=<udpate-request>[<udpate-request-list>]
            <udpate-request>::=<SRP><path-list>
            Where:
             <path-list>::=<SR-SFC-ERO>[<path-list>]

3.4.  PCRpt Message

   PCPRpt message sent from a PCC to PCE as a respond to a PCUpd message
   or in an unsolicited manner (e.g., during state synchronization).

   The format of the PCUpd message is defined as follows:

              <PCUpd Message>::=<Common Header>
                                <state-report-list>
              Where:
               <state-report-list>::=<state-report>[<state-report-list>]
               <state-report>::=[<SRP>]<path-list>
               Where:
                <path-list>::=<SR-SFC-ERO>[<path-list>]

4.  Object Formats

4.1.  OPEN Object

   This document defines a new optional TLV for use in the OPEN Object.

4.1.1.  SR-SFC PCE Capability TLV

   The SR-SFC-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   Object to negotiate SR-SFC capability on the PCEP session.  The
   format of the SR-SFC-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is shown in the following
   Figure 2:

                  Figure 2: SR-SFC-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV Format

   The code point for the TLV type is to be defined by IANA.  The TLV
   length is 4 octets.  The 32-bit value is formatted as follows.  The
   "Maximum SID Depth" (1 octet) field (MSD) specifies the maximum
   number of SIDs that a PCC is capable of imposing on a packet.  The
   "Flags" (1 octet) and "Reserved" (2 octets) fields are currently
   unused, and MUST be set to zero and ignored on receipt.

4.1.1.1.  Negotiating SR-SFC Capability

   The SR-SFC capability TLV is contained in the OPEN object.  By
   including the TLV in the OPEN message to a PCE, a PCC indicates its
   support for SFPs.  By including the TLV in the OPEN message to a PCC,
   a PCE indicates that it is capable of computing SFPs.

4.2.  RP/SRP Object

   In order to setup an SFP, the RP or SRP object MUST carry a PATH-
   SETUP-TYPE TLV specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-lsp-setup-type].  This
   document defines four new Path Setup Types (PST) for SR-SFC as
   follows:

      PST = 2: The path is an SFP.

      PST = 3: The path is a compact SFP.

      PST = 4: The path is an SR-specific SFP.

      PST = 5: The path is a compact SR-specific SFP.

4.3.  Include Route Object

   The IRO (Include Route Object) MUST be carried within PCReq messages
   to indicate a particular SFC.  Furthermore, the IRO MAY be carried in
   PCRep messages.  When carried within a PCRep message with the NO-PATH
   object, the IRO indicates the set of service functions that cause the
   PCE to fail to find a path.  This document defines a new sub-object
   type for the SR-SFC as follows:

       5          Service Function ID

4.4.  SR-SFC-ERO Object

   Generally speaking, an SR-SFC-ERO object consists of one or more ERO
   subobjects described in the following sub-sections to represent a
   particular type of service function path.  In the ERO subobject, each
   SID is associated with an identifier that represents either an SFF or
   an SF.  This identifier is referred to as the 'Node or Service
   Identifier' (NSI).  As described later, an NSI can be represented in
   various formats (e.g., IPv4 address, IPv6 address, SF identifier,
   etc).  Specifically, in the SFP case, the NSI of every ERO subobject
   contained in the SR-SFC-ERO object represents an SFF or an SF while
   the SID of each ERO subobject is set to null.  In the compact SFP
   case, the NSI of every ERO subobject contained in the SR-SFC-ERO
   object only represents an SFF meanwhile the SID of every ERO
   subobject is set to null.  In the SR-specific SFP, the NSI of every
   ERO subobject contained in the SR-SFC-ERO object represents an SFF or
   an SF while the SID of every ERO subject MUST NOT be null.  In the
   compact SR-specific SFP, the NSI of every ERO subobject contained in
   the SR-SFC-ERO object represents an SFF meanwhile the SID of every
   ERO subobject MUST NOT be null.

4.4.1.  SR-SFC-ERO Subobject

   An SR-SFC-ERO subobject (as shown in Figure 3) consists of a 32-bit
   header followed by the SID and the NSI associated with the SID.  The
   SID is a 32-bit or 128 bit number.  The size of the NSI depends on
   its respective type, as described in the following sub-sections.

                 Figure 3: SR-SFC-ERO Subobject Format

      'L' Flag: indicates whether the subobject represents a loose-hop
      in the explicit route [RFC3209].  If this flag is unset, a PCC
      MUST not overwrite the SID value present in the SR-SFC-ERO

      subobject.  Otherwise, a PCC MAY expand or replace one or more SID
      value(s) in the received SR-SFC-ERO based on its local policy.

      Type: is the type of the SR-SFC-ERO Subobject.  This document
      defines the SR-SFC-ERO Subobject type.  A new code point will be
      requested for the SR-SFC-ERO Subobject from IANA.

      Length: contains the total length of the subobject in octets,
      including the L, Type and Length fields.  Length MUST be at least
      4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.

      NSI Type (NSIT): indicates the type of NSI associated with the
      SID.  The NSI-Type values are described later in this document.

      Flags: is used to carry any additional information pertaining to
      SID.  Currently, the following flag bits are defined:

         M: When this bit is set, the SID value represents an MPLS label
         stack entry as specified in [RFC5462], where only the label
         value is specified by the PCE.  Other fields (TC, S, and TTL)
         fields MUST be considered invalid, and PCC MUST set these
         fields according to its local policy and MPLS forwarding rules.

         C: When this bit as well as the M bit are set, then the SID
         value represents an MPLS label stack entry as specified in
         [RFC5462], where all the entry's fields (Label, TC, S, and TTL)
         are specified by the PCE.  However, a PCC MAY choose to
         override TC, S, and TTL values according its local policy and
         MPLS forwarding rules.

         S: When this bit is set, the SID value in the subobject body is
         null.  In this case, the PCC is responsible for choosing the
         SID value, e.g., by looking up its Traffic Engineering Database
         (TED) using node/service identifier in the subobject body.

         F: When this bit is set, the NSI value in the subobject body is
         null.// When will the NSI value is null?

         P: When this bit is set, the SID value represents an IPv6
         address.

      SID: is the 4-octect or 16-octect Segment Identifier.

      NSI: contains the NSI associated with the SID.  Depending on the
      value of NSIT, the NSI can have different format as described in
      the following sub-section.

4.4.2.  NSI Associated with SID

   This document defines the following NSIs:

      'IPv4 Node ID': is specified as an IPv4 address.  In this case,
      NSIT and Length are 1 and 12 respectively.

      'IPv6 Node ID': is specified as an IPv6 address.  In this case,
      NSIT and Length are 2 and 24 respectively.

      'Service Function ID': is specified as an SF ID.  In this case,
      NSIT and Length are TBD.

4.4.3.  SR-SFC-ERO Processing

   TBD

5.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  PCEP Objects

   IANA is requested to allocate an ERO subobject type (recommended
   value= 6) for the SR-SFC-ERO subobject.

6.2.  PCEP-Error Object

   TBD
