1.    Introduction

                                <LZIP>                       July 2005 
 
   The Push-IMAP protocol (P-IMAP) is based on IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501], 
   but contains additional enhancements for optimization in a mobile 
   setting.  LZIP provides an extension to allow compression of the 
   exchanged messages to and from the mobile client. 
    
   While it could be argued that transport could provide generic 
   compression of the data (e.g. TLS with NULL Cipher), application 
   level compression presents the advantage to be better tunable to the 
   type of data.  
    
   Compression performances depend on the actual types of e-mail that 
   are received. They change between text bodies and different types of 
   attachments.  In general, LZIP present a significant gain over 
   uncompressed or network compressed only approached at very little 
   extra cost for the implementer. 
    
   LZIP allows for compression of responses to a command.  Practical 
   testing results shows significant performance improvement when the 
   responses to FETCH FLAGS or header information, body parts and 
   attachments are compressed. 
    
   Bandwidth optimization are are important features required in 
   particular to support mobile email use cases [MEMAIL][OMA-ME-RD] 
      
2.   Relation with other specifications 
    
   LZIP can be seen as an command that allows optimization of IMAP for 
   mobile clients. 
    
   The Lemonade Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] specifies the Lemonade Pull 
   Model that governs the exchanges among mail servers or between 
   desktop mail client and mail servers. Lemonade investigates adding 
   mobile optimizations for the next version of the profile. 
    
   LZIP should be seen as a way to address the issues of bandwidth 
   optimization and an input to the Lemonade Profile work.  
    
   This document assumes that clients MUST be compliant to LZIP, if they 
   decide to use LZIP. The server that advertises support for LZIP via 
   CAPABILITY MUST be compliant to LZIP for its exchanges with the 
   mobile client.  
    
   LZIP adopts the æliteral8Æ format of the IMAP BINARY specification 
   [RFC3516] for its response.  
    
   LZIP relies on the DEFLATE compression algorithm and format specified 
   in [RFC1951].

3.   The CAPABILITY Command 
    
   The CAPABILITY command is defined in RFC3501, section 6.1.1.  The 
   client sends a CAPABILITY command so it can query the server to find 
   out what commands it supports.  In RFC3501, the IMAP server is 
   allowed to specify additional capabilities not included in that 
   specification.  A server that supports LZIP conforms to that 
   requirement, and must list that it supports LZIP.   
    
   A server can also enumerate individually the other commands that it 
   supports.  
    
   capability_cmd =  tag SP "CAPABILITY"  
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY 
   Result:  OK - capability completed 
      BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 
    
   Example: A P-IMAP server that implements LZIP.  
      C: a001 CAPABILITY 
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=LOGIN IDLE LZIP 
      S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed 
 
4.   LZIP Command 
    
   The LZIP command is used for zipping the response (and optionally the 
   request) of a command and can be used while the server is in any 
   state.  In either case, the data is compressed according to [RFC1951] 
   and transmitted according to the æliteral8Æ rule of [RFC3516]. The 
   LZIP command takes in a complete second command (including a tag for 
   that command).  In an untagged response to LZIP, the server gives a 
   æliteral8Æ response including the number of bytes in the zipped 
   response to the enclosed command, as well as the response to that 
   command in ZIP format.   
 
   LZIP can also compress the command request, although this is most 
   useful when the command request is large. Short command strings may 
   still benefit from compression, but most likely, the overhead of the 
   LZIP syntax itself, which adds about 20 characters to the command 
   request, will wipe out any gains. 
    
   The format for LZIP is 
    
   lzip_cmd =  tag SP "LZIP" SP [INLINE æ{æ length æ}Æ] (command or 
   zipped-compressed command) 
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  "{" num "}" zipped-response-to-command 
   Result:  OK - the command given was g-zipped correctly and sent 
            BAD - invalid arguments, i.e. command given is in the wrong

               format. 
    
   Example: Zipping the response to a FETCH command. 
      C: A001 LZIP A002 FETCH 1:* ALL 
      S: * LZIP ~{10933843723}  
      S: ...[zipped response to FETCH command]... CRLF 
      S: A001 OK LZIP completed 
   When the client unzips the body of the response to the FETCH command 
   it gets: 
      * 1 FETCH ... 
      ... 
      A002 OK FETCH completed 
    
   Example: command request compression using FETCH 
    
   C: A001 LZIP INLINE {1234} (zip-compressed string æa002 FETCH ...Æ) 
   S: * LZIP ~{4567} 
   S: ... [zipped response to FETCH command] . . .CRLF 
   S: A001 OK LZIP completed 
    
   The client can then unzip the body of the response as above. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   LZIP does not introduce additional security consideration with 
   respect to IMAPv4Rev1.
