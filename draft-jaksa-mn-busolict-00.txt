Abstract

   This draft documents an idea whereby a Mobile IPv6 node may request
   binding information from its respective Home Agent about other Mobile
   IPv6 nodes all using the same home agent.

Internet-Draft   Requesting MN binding from a home agent    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The tunneling of packets between the correspondent node and the
   mobile node via the home agent is known as bidirectional tunneling.
   Bidirectional tunneling ensures that the mobile node is always
   reachable when it is away from home, even if the correspondent node
   is not Mobile IPv6-capable.  The sending of packets directly between
   a mobile node and a Mobile IPv6-capable correspondent node is known
   as route optimization. [1]

   There may be usage scenarios whereby a correspondent node may wish to
   maintain the binding information for other Mobile IPv6 nodes without
   first exchanging data packets or requiring a mobile node to send
   binding updates to the correspondent node.  This draft documents a
   proposal whereby a correspondent node may query a home agent for
   binding information about another mobile node.  In particular this
   draft seeks to document a couple of usage cases.  It is assumed
   throughout this draft that the requesting correspondent node is also
   a Mobile IPv6 supported node that is requesting binding information
   from its respective Home Agent about another Mobile IPv6 node that is
   also being serviced by the same Home Agent.


2.  Terminology

   See [2] for mobility terminology used in this document.


3.  Usage Cases

   Mobile IPv6 [1] defines a process during which a mobile node sends a
   Binding Update to its home agent or a correspondent node, causing a
   binding for the mobile node to be registered.  Usage scenarios exist
   whereby a correspondent node may wish to request the mobile node's
   binding from it's home agent.

   Mobile based applications or services may need to know if another
   mobile node is connected or active.  For example, the absence of a
   binding association for a homeless mobile node may mean that the node
   is not active or connected.  Perhaps the mobile node is in nomadic
   mode and is currently inactive.  A correspondent node can make a
   request to the home agent for the binding information.  Applications
   may then use the binding cache to obtain information about on-line or
   active status for the respective mobile node.  Examples may include
   end-to-end gaming applications that may need to know if nodes within
   some predefined communication group are active (i.e., on-line).  Here
   the Home agent is providing information to a node about the current
   reachability status of another node.

   Location based service support for mobile nodes is another usage
   case.  For example, a server may wish to periodically track the
   movement and/or location of mobile nodes that are subscribing to its
   services even though there is not an active on-going session.  The
   correspondent node providing the services may periodically check the
   location of the mobile node by requesting its binding information
   from the home agent.  Services may then retrieve the binding cache
   and push location-based information to the mobile node.


4.  Security Considerations

   It is assumed throughout this draft that the requesting correspondent
   node is also a Mobile IPv6 supported node that is requesting binding
   information from its respective Home Agent about another Mobile IPv6
   node that is also being serviced by the same Home Agent.  As such
   there is already a security association between the nodes requesting
   binding information and the home agent.  Instead of sending a binding
   update to the home agent, a request for another mobile nodes binding
   information is being made.

   What needs to be fretted out is a way to keep private home agent
   binding cache entries for mobile nodes that don't want to disclose
   this information.
