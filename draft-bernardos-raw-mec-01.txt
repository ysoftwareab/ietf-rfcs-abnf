1.  Introduction

   Wireless operates on a shared medium, and transmissions cannot be
   fully deterministic due to uncontrolled interferences, including
   self-induced multipath fading.  RAW (Reliable and Available Wireless)
   is an effort to provide Deterministic Networking on across a path
   that include a wireless interface.  RAW provides for high reliability
   and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium.  The
   wireless medium presents significant challenges to achieve
   deterministic properties such as low packet error rate, bounded
   consecutive losses, and bounded latency.  RAW extends the DetNet
   Working Group concepts to provide for high reliability and
   availability for an IP network utilizing scheduled wireless segments
   and other media, e.g., frequency/time-sharing physical media
   resources with stochastic traffic: IEEE Std. 802.15.4 timeslotted
   channel hopping (TSCH), 3GPP 5G ultra-reliable low latency
   communications (URLLC), IEEE 802.11ax/be, and L-band Digital
   Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), etc.  Similar to DetNet,
   RAW technologies aim at staying abstract to the radio layers
   underneath, addressing the Layer 3 aspects in support of applications
   requiring high reliability and availability.

   As introduced in [I-D.pthubert-raw-architecture], RAW separates the
   path computation time scale at which a complex path is recomputed
   from the path selection time scale at which the forwarding decision
   is taken for one or a few packets.  RAW operates at the path
   selection time scale.  The RAW problem is to decide, amongst the
   redundant solutions that are proposed by the Patch Computation
   Element (PCE), which one will be used for each packet to provide a

   Reliable and Available service while minimizing the waste of
   constrained resources.  To that effect, RAW defines the Path
   Selection Engine (PSE) that is the counter-part of the PCE to perform
   rapid local adjustments of the forwarding tables within the diversity
   that the PCE has selected for the Track.  The PSE enables to exploit
   the richer forwarding capabilities with Packet (hybrid) ARQ,
   Replication, Elimination and Ordering (PAREO), and scheduled
   transmissions at a faster time scale.

   Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) -- formerly known as Mobile Edge
   Computing -- capabilities deployed in the edge of the mobile network
   can facilitate the efficient and dynamic provision of services to
   mobile users.  The ETSI ISG MEC working group, operative from end of
   2014, intends to specify an open environment for integrating MEC
   capabilities with service providers' networks, including also
   applications from 3rd parties.  These distributed computing
   capabilities will make available IT infrastructure as in a cloud
   environment for the deployment of functions in mobile access
   networks.

   One relevant exemplary scenario showing the need for an integration
   of RAW and MEC is introduced next.  One of the main (and distinct)
   use cases of 5G is Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications
   (URLLC).  Among the many so-called "verticals" that require URLLC
   features, the Industry 4.0 (also referred to as Wireless for
   Industrial Applications) is probably the one with more short-term
   potential.  As identified in [I-D.bernardos-raw-use-cases], this
   scenario also calls for RAW solutions, as cables are not that
   suitable for the robots and mobile vehicles typically used in
   factories.  This is also a very natural scenario for MEC deployments,
   as bounded, and very low latencies are needed between the robots and
   physical actuators and the control logic managing them.  Figure 1
   depicts an exemplary scenario of a factory where terminals (robots
   and mobile automated guided vehicles) are wirelessly connected.
   Control applications running in the edge (implemented as MEC
   applications) require bounded low latencies and a guaranteed
   availability, despite the mobility of the terminals and the changing
   wireless conditions.  An heterogeneous wireless mesh network is used
   to provide connectivity inside the factory.

    Figure 1: Exemplary scenario depicting MEC and RAW in an industrial
                               environments

   This scenario includes a wireless domain, involving multiple MEC
   platforms to ensure low latency to applications, by being able to
   host MEC applications in several locations, and dynamically migrate
   the apps as the terminals move around and the serving MEC platform
   might no longer be capable of meeting the latency requirements.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the ETSI MEC
   ISG, and the IETF:

      MEC host.  The mobile edge host is an entity that contains a
      mobile edge platform and a virtualization infrastructure which
      provides compute, storage, and network resources, for the purpose
      of running mobile edge applications.

      MEC platform.  The mobile edge platform is the collection of
      essential functionalities required to run mobile edge applications
      on a particular virtualization infrastructure and enable them to
      provide and consume mobile edge services.

      MEPM.  MEC Platform Manager.

      MEC applications.  Mobile edge applications are instantiated on
      the virtualization infrastructure of the mobile edge host based on
      configuration requests validated by the mobile edge management.

      PAREO.  Packet (hybrid) ARQ, Replication, Elimination and
      Ordering.  PAREO is a superset Of DetNet's PREOF that includes
      radio-specific techniques such as short range broadcast, MUMIMO,
      constructive interference and overhearing, which can be leveraged
      separately or combined to increase the reliability.

      PSE.  The Path Selection Engine (PSE) is the counter-part of the
      PCE to perform rapid local adjustments of the forwarding tables
      within the diversity that the PCE has selected for the Track.  The
      PSE enables to exploit the richer forwarding capabilities with
      PAREO and scheduled transmissions at a faster time scale over the
      smaller domain that is the Track, in either a loose or a strict
      fashion.

3.  Problem Statement

   With current standards, the MEC platform(s) would have to interact
   with a Path Computation Element (PCE) for data plane requests and
   updates.  This tremendously limits the capabilities to guarantee
   real-time forwarding decisions, as it will make it challenging and
   not possible to manage forwarding decisions in real or near-real
   time.

   RAW solutions and approaches being explored today consider the role
   of the PSE, which computes at a short time scale which of the
   available paths (called tracks) -- computed by a PCE -- should be
   used per flow/packet and also which PAREO functions can be used, in



Bernardos & Mourad        Expires July 22, 2021                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           RAW and MEC integration            January 2021


   order to provide the flow with the required availability and
   reliability features.  The PSE interacts with the PCE and with the
   RAW nodes so they can setup the required per-flow state, to recognize
   the flow and determine the forwarding policy to be applied.  These
   RAW forwarding decisions can be distributed among the necessary nodes
   using in-band signaling (e.g., extending Segment Routing, BIER-TE or
   DETNET tagging) or can be taken autonomously by each forwarding node
   locally (based on its knowledge of the status of the network, gained
   via OAM RAW-specific mechanisms).

   Figure 1 shows an exemplary scenario, depicting an industrial
   environment where different nodes are wirelessly connected to provide
   connectivity to several stationary and mobile terminals (i.e.,
   robots).  Industry environments are a good example of applications
   where reliability and availability are critical.  Ensuring this in
   wireless heterogeneous and multi-hop networks requires using multiple
   paths, using PAREO functions and even using dual or multiple
   connectivity.  Terminal mobility makes it even more challenging to
   guarantee certain reliability and availability levels, due to the
   dynamic and fast changes that this needs at the data plane level.
   The short-time scale forwarding decisions that are required to ensure
   reliability and availability with terminal mobility cannot be managed
   if MEC platforms can only interact with the data plane through the
   PCE.

   The PCE is responsible for routing computation and maintenance in a
   network and it is typically a centralized entity that can even reside
   outside the network.  It is meant to compute and establish redundant
   paths, but not to be sensitive/reactive to transient changes, and
   therefore is not capable of ensuring a certain level of reliability
   and availability in a wireless heterogeneous mesh network, especially
   if some of the nodes (e.g., the end terminals) might be mobile.  With
   currently standardized solutions, a MEC platform could only interact
   with the RAW network through the PCE, most possibly through the Mp2
   reference point defined by ETSI MEC.  This reference point is defined
   between the MEC platform and the data plane of the virtualization
   infrastructure to instruct the data plane on how to route traffic
   among applications, networks, services, etc.  This reference point is
   not further specified by ETSI MEC, but it would be the one that could
   be used by current solutions to allow for MEC to request the data
   plane on the RAW network a certain behavior (in terms of availability
   and reliability) for MEC app traffic flows.  With existing solutions,
   the PCE would be the entry point for configuring and managing the RAW
   network, probably through the Mp2 reference point.  Note that the PCE
   might reside outside the RAW network, the path between the RAW
   network and the PCE might be expensive and slow (e.g., it might need
   to traverse the whole RAW network) and reaching to the PCE can also

Internet-Draft           RAW and MEC integration            January 2021


   be slow in regards to the speed of events that affect the forwarding
   operation at the radio layer.

   Additionally, the MEC architecture as currently defined by ETSI does
   not have any component designed to deal with the specifics of an
   heterogeneous wireless multi-hop networks (such a RAW one), and
   therefore, it is very limited in terms of what a MEC app (through the
   MEC platform) can request to the data plane of an heterogeneous
   wireless multi-hop network.  Besides, this lack of RAW-aware
   component at the ETSI MEC architecture prevents any enhancement at
   either the MEC side (e.g., MEC app migrations triggered by RAW status
   updates) or the RAW side (e.g., PAREO function updates triggered by
   MEC app/terminal mobility).

   Because of all these aforementioned reasons, it is needed to define a
   new RAW-enabled component at the ETSI MEC architecture, aimed at
   enabling a more direct interaction between the MEC platform and the
   RAW network, allowing the MEC platform to notify events and/or
   request actions to the RAW network quick enough.  This involves some
   challenges, as the RAW PSE has to understand the needs from the
   running MEC applications, so it can properly configure the RAW nodes
   so the data plane provides the required reliability and availability.

4.  RAW and MEC integration

   This document defines a new entity inside the MEC platform: the RAW
   ctrl.  This entity is responsible for computing what to instruct the
   RAW PSE, based on the requirements of the MEC apps, as well as to
   take decisions at the MEC side (e.g., migration of apps) based on
   information about the RAW network status.

   As a result of the introduction of the RAW ctrl and the actions it is
   responsible of, new interactions and interface semantics are added.
   These interactions and semantics can be terminated at either the PCE
   or the RAW PSE, depending on the requirements of the MEC apps.  For
   near real-time coordination and control between MEC and RAW
   mechanisms, the interactions are between the RAW ctrl and the RAW
   PSE.  We mostly refer to this deployment model from now on, as it is
   the one that allow for near real-time updates on the forwarding
   plane, but note that an alternative deployment model in which the RAW
   ctrl interacts with the PCE is also possible, though only supporting
   non real-time interactions.

   The MEC-RAW new interface semantics/extensions depicted in Figure 2
   allows the MEC platform to issue requests to the RAW network, through
   the RAW PSE, so it can behave as required by MEC apps.

                          Figure 2: Block diagram

   The new semantics of the interface between the MEC platform and the
   RAW PSE do not only serve to convey the requests, but also to
   synchronize the status and topology of the RAW (relevant portion of
   the) network, enabling to perform real-time or near-real time
   forwarding decisions.  In the sequel, we show different exemplary
   signaling diagrams for the most relevant procedures.

4.1.  MEC app request for RAW

   Here we specify the interface extensions and signaling procedures
   needed to enable a MEC app describe and request its needs in terms of
   availability and reliability.  As it will be further developed in
   other subsections, the wireless network conditions could also have an
   impact back on the MEC platform (e.g., by triggering the migration of
   the MEC app).

   Figure 3 shows an exemplary signaling flow diagram, in which a
   certain MEC app request a given behavior for the treatment of the
   packets the app generates.  We consider an industrial wireless
   application scenario, as the one used in previous sections, as an
   example for the sake of describing the interface and specified
   interactions.

   The MEC platform is enhanced with a RAW ctrl entity, as introduced in
   the previous section.  The RAW ctrl is a RAW-aware component within
   the MEC architecture that enables the required interactions with the
   RAW network, through the RAW PSE.  This allows MEC apps to: (i) adapt
   to RAW conditions (e.g., if the requested reliability and
   availability is not possible), and (ii) dynamically modify the

                     Figure 3: MEC app request for RAW

   We next explain each of the steps illustrated in the figure:

   1.  A MEC app which is going to be consumed by a given terminal (or
       set of terminals, though in this example we show just one
       consumer), specifies to the MEC platform the characteristics of
       the traffic is going to generate and its associated requirements.

   2.  The MEC platform -- namely the RAW ctrl component, which is RAW-
       aware and knows the characteristics of the deployment -- analyzes
       the characteristics of the MEC app traffic and the provided
       requirements, and generates a new request -- over a new interface
       between the MEC platform and the RAW PSE -- that includes, among
       others, the following parameters:

Internet-Draft           RAW and MEC integration            January 2021


       *  An ID for the given flow, which can be used for future near
          real-time update/configuration operations on the same flow.

       *  The flow specification, describing the characteristics of the
          packets, allowing an efficient identification of flow(s) based
          on well-known fields in IPv4, IPv6, and transport layer
          headers like TCP and UDP.  An example of how to do this is
          defined in the Traffic Selectors for Flow Bindings [RFC6088].

       *  The requirements of the flow in terms of reliability and
          availability.

   3.  The RAW PSE processes the request, and based on its knowledge of
       the network (topology, node capabilities and ongoing flows)
       computes the best way of transmitting the packets over the RAW
       network (using the available paths/tracks, previously computed by
       a PCE).  Note that at this point it might be possible that the
       RAW PSE realizes that it is not possible to provide the requested
       reliability and availability characteristics, and would report
       that back to the MEC platform (which might issue a new request
       with less requirements).  The RAW PSE sends control packets to
       each of the RAW nodes involved, instructing how to deal with the
       packets belonging to the MEC app flow.  This includes:

       *  assigning an ID to the flow;

       *  instructing the entry point in the RAW network to tag packets
          with that ID;

       *  specific PAREO functions to be used by each of the RAW nodes.
          This might be signaled to each of the RAW nodes, or just to
          some of them (e.g., only the entry point) who can then use in-
          band signaling to specify it.

   4.  The MEC app generates traffic (step 4a in the figure) which
       arrives at the RAW entry point in the network, which following
       the instructions of the RAW PSE, encapsulates and tags the
       packet, and might also include in-band signaling (e.g., using
       Segment Routing).  Some PAREO functions are applied to the MEC
       app traffic packets (step 4b in the figure) to achieve the
       required levels of reliability and availability.  In the figure,
       as an example, packets are replicated (this could be done by
       means of wireless overhearing) at one point of the network, and
       then later duplicated packets eliminated.

4.2.  RAW OAM triggering MEC app migration

   Here we specify the mechanisms for MEC to benefit from RAW OAM
   information, for example, to trigger the migration of a MEC
   application to a different MEC platform, to ensure that the
   requirements of the MEC app continue to be met.

              Figure 4: RAW OAM triggering MEC app migration

   Figure 4 shows an exemplary signaling flow diagram, in which changes
   in the RAW network, detected thanks to RAW OAM, trigger the migration
   of a MEC app.  We assume there is already a MEC app deployed and
   traffic is already flowing (i.e., all the procedures explained in the




Bernardos & Mourad        Expires July 22, 2021                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           RAW and MEC integration            January 2021


   previous section took already place).  We next explain each of the
   steps illustrated in the figure:

   1.  RAW OAM signaling is periodically and reactively exchanged
       between the RAW nodes and the RAW PSE
       [I-D.theoleyre-raw-oam-support].

   2.  If the conditions of the network get worse (e.g., because of
       changes in the radio propagation of a critical link), making it
       impossible to guarantee the required levels of reliability and
       availability, this generates a message from the RAW PSE to the
       MEC platform, indicating that a given MEC app flow can no longer
       be served.

   3.  The currently serving MEC platform triggers a MEC app migration
       to a different MEC platform.  This involves the MEC platform
       manager.  Note that the MEC platform might provide suggestions
       regarding where to migrate the MEC app, based on its knowledge of
       the RAW network status, acquired by the RAW ctrl through
       interactions with the PSE.

   4.  The same steps 2-3-4 specified in the procedure described in
       Section 4.1 take place.  In this step, the MEC platform generates
       a new request to the RAW PSE.

   5.  The RAW PSE processes the request, and based on its knowledge of
       the network computes the best way of transmit the packets over
       the RAW network.  The RAW PSE sends control packets to each of
       the RAW nodes involved.

   6.  The MEC app generates traffic, arriving at the RAW entry point in
       the network, which following the instructions of the RAW PSE,
       encapsulates and tags the packet.

4.3.  MEC OAM for RAW updates

   There are scenarios and situations where -- due to the mobility of
   the terminals or the nodes hosting the MEC platform hosting a given
   MEC app -- it might be needed to take actions on the RAW network:
   e.g., to update the paths, apply different PAREO functions, migrate
   the MEC app (thus involving a change in the RAW forwarding).  This
   triggers the need for mechanisms enabling the RAW PSE to get and use
   MEC OAM information to update traffic forwarding at the RAW network
   as needed to adapt to varying conditions, e.g., due to node mobility.

                     Figure 5: MEC OAM for RAW updates

   Figure 5 shows an exemplary signaling flow diagram, in which the
   mobility of the a node (in this case the terminal, but it could have
   been the MEC platform hosting the MEC app) triggers the need for
   updating RAW forwarding mechanisms.  As in the previous section, we
   assume there is already a MEC app deployed and traffic is already
   flowing (i.e., all the procedures explained in Section 4.1 took
   already place).  We next explain each of the steps illustrated in the
   figure:

   1.  The MEC platform notifies that the terminal consuming the MEC app
       is moving (note that it other events can be notified, such as the

       mobility of the MEC platform itself), including the expected
       trajectory (if can be known or predicted in advance, as it will
       be the case in most cases in several scenarios, such as
       industrial use cases).

   2.  The RAW PSE uses this information to re-compute how to best
       provided the reliability and availability needed by the MEC app
       traffic flow, and updates the RAW nodes about the PAREO functions
       that they have to apply.

   3.  After this, traffic from the MEC app benefits from updated
       policies, computed according to the new conditions, and ensuring
       that the requirements of the MEC app continue to be fulfilled.
