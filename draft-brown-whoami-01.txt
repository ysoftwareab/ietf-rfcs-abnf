1.  Introduction

   It is common for Domain Registries (Section 1.2) - whether country-
   code or generic, operating at the second-level or lower - to operate
   a directory service to allow interested parties to identify the
   entity to which a Domain (Section 1.2) has been allocated.
   Typically, access to this directory service is provided using WHOIS
   [RFC3912] or RDAP [RFC7480] services.

   Consequently, Domain Registries have developed a model whereby the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5733] is used to collect
   large volumes of data - much of which is Personal Data (see [RFC6973]
   for further discussion) - and then make this data available, with few
   restrictions, to anyone who might want it, for reasons both benign
   and malign.  This is especially the case for generic Top-Level Domain
   Registries, who are subject to policy obligations which, as of
   writing, require a uniform data model for Registration Data
   (Section 1.2), and do not permit differentiated access to this data.

   This document proposes a decentralised alternative to traditional
   WHOIS directories.  To avoid the need for Domain Registries to
   collect Registration Data, it provides a means by which Domain
   Operators (Section 1.2) may, at their own discretion (or in

   compliance with a Domain Registry's policy requirements), publish
   their contact information in a machine-readable manner.

   It is contended that this approach eliminates the need for registries
   to maintain large databases of contact information, while still
   allowing supporting most of the uses to which such databases are put.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Definitions

   In addition to the terms definied in this section, this document
   makes use of the terminology defined in [RFC7719].

   Domain:  A domain object as specified in [RFC5731].  In the DNS, this
      object corresponds to a Delegation of a "child" Zone from the
      "parent" Zone operated by the Domain Registry.

   Domain Registry:  The entity which (a) operates a provisioning
      service (such as EPP) for one or more Zones, the Authoritative
      server(s) for those Zones, and optionally a WHOIS and/or RDAP
      service.

   Domain Registrant:  The entity to whom the operation and usage of a
      Domain is assigned by a Registry.

   Domain Operator:  The entity (or entities) responsible for the
      administration of the Zone in the DNS corresponding to Domain.
      The Operator of a Domain may or may not also be its Registrant.

   Registration Data:  Metadata about a Domain object, such as its
      creation, update, and expiration date, the nameservers to which it
      is delegated, and the sponsoring registrar, plus a collection of
      zero or more Points of Contact for the Domain Registrant, Domain
      Operator and/or other entities responsible for the administration
      of a Domain.

   Point of Contact (PoC):  Contact information, including Contact Name,
      Organisation Name, Postal Addres, email, voice and fax numbers,
      for a single entity (which may be a natural person or legal
      entity).

   WHOAMI Record:  A Point of Contact in vCard [RFC6350] format.

2.  WHOAMI Protocol

   Domain Operators MAY choose to publish a WHOAMI Record in conformance
   with this specification.  It may be published (a) at a URL indicated
   by a URI record [RFC7553] published in the DNS (as described in
   Section 2.1), or (b) at a well-known URL (as described in
   Section 2.2).

   Software which consumes WHOAMI records SHOULD first perform a DNS
   query for the URI record for a Domain, falling back to the well-known
   URL if the query does not return a positive result.

2.1.  URI Record

   Domain Operators MAY publish the URL of their WHOAMI record as a URI
   record in the DNS.  An example of such a record is below:

   $ORIGIN example.com.
   _nicname._tcp IN URI 10 1 https://example.com/whoami/whoami.vcf

   Note: the Owner Name, Priority, Weight, and Target in the above
   record are illustrative only.

   The Service Tag of the URI record is constructed as per Section 4.1
   of [RFC7553], with the "_nicname" tag being derived from the "Who Is
   Protocol" entry in the "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port
   Number Registry (see [RFC6335]).

2.1.1.  URI Record with a data: scheme

   Domain Operators MAY publish a record with a "data:" scheme
   [RFC2397].  This allows the WHOAMI record to be embedded in the URI
   record itself.  An example of such a URI is below:

   data:text/vcard;charset=utf-8;base64,QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNClZFUlNJT046NC4w
   DQpVSUQ6dXJuOnV1aWQ6NGZiZTg5NzEtMGJjMy00MjRjLTljMjYtMzZjM2UxZWZmNmIxD
   QpGTjtQSUQ9MS4xOkouIERvZQ0KTjpEb2U7Si47OzsNCkVNQUlMO1BJRD0xLjE6amRvZU
   BleGFtcGxlLmNvbQ0KQ0xJRU5UUElETUFQOjE7dXJuOnV1aWQ6NTNlMzc0ZDktMzM3ZS0
   0NzI3LTg4MDMtYTFlOWMxNGUwNTU2DQpFTkQ6VkNBUkQ=

   If a "data:" scheme is used, the MIME type of the data MUST be "text/
   vcard".

2.2.  Well-Known URL

   Domain Operators MAY publish their WHOAMI record at the following
   URL:

Internet-Draft                Domain WHOAMI                February 2018


   http://example.com/.well-known/whoami/whoami.vcf

   The "whoami" path segment has been registered in the "Well-Known URI
   Registry" (see [RFC5785]).

   Software which consumes WHOAMI records SHOULD follow 3xx redirections
   return in server responses.

   It is RECOMMENDED that web servers which support HTTP over Transport
   Layer Security [RFC2818] provide a 3xx redirect to the HTTPS version
   of this URL.

   The Content-Type header of the server response MUST be "text/vcard".

3.  Operational Considerations

3.1.  Domain Registries

   TODO

3.2.  Domain Registrants

   TODO

   Domain Operators MAY configure the HTTP server which hosts their
   WHOAMI record to restrict access to this information (based some form
   of authentication such as HTTP Basic Authentication [RFC7617] or
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

3.3.  Domain Operators

   TODO

3.4.  WHOAMI Clients

   TODO

4.  Security Considerations

      TODO, but probably lots.

5.  Privacy Considerations

      TODO, but probably lots.
