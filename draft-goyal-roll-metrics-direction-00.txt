1.  Introduction

   Asymmetric links are a common observation in low power and lossy
   networks (LLNs) [sang_2010].  Many link-level routing metrics have a
   directional aspect.  Although such routing metrics can be defined in
   a bidirectional manner so as to account for the link properties in
   both directions, this is not always desirable.  In the context of RPL
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], the IPv6 routing protocol for LLNs, it may be
   necessary to measure a link-level routing metric in a particular
   direction.  For example, if the intent is to build a directional
   acyclic graph (DAG) specifically for the purpose of low latency
   communication to the DAG root, the routing metric must measure the
   link latency in Up direction, i.e., towards the DAG root, as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Similarly, if a temporary DAG is being
   constructed to discover a point-to-point route towards a destination
   [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl], the routing metric must calculate the
   relevant link characteristic in Down direction, i.e., away from the
   DAG root, as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Thus, there is a need
   to specify the directional aspect of a link-level routing metric.

   Accordingly, this document defines a Direction field inside the
   Routing Metric/Constraint object header, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].  The Direction field is defined in
   two previously reserved bits inside the Routing Metric/Constraint
   object header.  The modified Routing Metric/Constraint object header
   is backward compatible with its definition in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology] and [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Specifically,
   the term RPL node refers to an RPL router or an RPL host as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

         Figure 1: Routing Metric/Constraint object generic format

   The modified Routing Metric/Constraint object header is illustrated
   in Figure 1.  The Direction (or D) field is a 2-bit field that
   indicates the direction associated with the routing metric/
   constraint:

   o  D = 0x00: undefined;

   o  D = 0x01: Up;

   o  D = 0x02: Down;

   o  D = 0x03: Bidirectional.

   If the D field has value 0x00, the direction associated with the
   routing metric/constraint is undefined as in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].  A value 0x00 for the D field may be
   suitable for node-level routing metrics/constraints defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].  The D field value in link-level
   routing metrics/constraints SHOULD NOT be set to 0x00.

   This document does not specify how to measure/evaluate a routing
   metric/constraint object in the direction specified by the D field.
   The measurement/evaluation methodology for specific routing metrics/
   constraints, taking in account the D field, may be specified in a
   separate document.

   A routing metric/constraint object MUST be measured/evaluated in
   accordance with its D field value if defined.  In case, an RPL node
   can not measure/evaluate the routing metric/constraint object in the
   specified direction, the following rules MUST be applied:

   o  If the object is a recorded metric, i.e., has C=0 and R=1 fields,
      the RPL node MUST set the P flag inside the object, thereby

      indicating the partial nature of the recorded metric.

   o  If the object is an aggregated metric, i.e., has C=0 and R=0
      fields, the RPL node MUST drop the DIO containing the object.

   o  If the object is a mandatory constraint, i.e., has C=1 and O=0
      fields, the RPL node MUST drop the DIO containing the object.

   o  If the object is an optional constraint, i.e., has C=1 and O=1
      fields, the RPL node MAY drop the DIO containing the object or it
      MAY continue processing rest of the DIO ignoring this object.
