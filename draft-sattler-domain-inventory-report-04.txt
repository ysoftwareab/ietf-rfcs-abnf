1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide many detailed reports and
   documents that their registrars require on a daily, weekly and
   monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction reports, as
   well as lists containing currently unavailable domains and current
   premium domain fees. These reports are critical for registrars'
   businesses and play an important role in accounting and operations
   processes as well as in sales and marketing activities. In the
   current set-up, registrars must download these reports from each
   registry's intranet differently according to each registry's document
   management set up.
   
   A domain inventory comparison between the domains that are on an
   accreditation/account and the domain names that a registrar/reseller
   has in its system is therefore useful.
   
   This document describes the content of a Domain Inventory Report
   based on the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-report-structure] and delivered
   by the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-reporting-repository].

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   specified in their uppercase forms.

Internet-Draft          Domain Inventory Report             October 2019
   
2.1.  Internationalized Domain Names

   MUST be as defined in
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-report-structure].
   
2.2.  Character Encoding

   MUST be as defined in
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-report-structure].
   
2.3.  Dates and Times

   MUST be as defined in
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-report-structure].

3.  Report Headings

   The first row MUST be the column headings in the following order:
   
   TLD               It MUST contain the top-level domain name and
                     formatted according to section 2.1 of this
                     document.
   
   DOMAIN            It MUST contain the domain name formatted according
                     to section 2.1 of this document.
                     
   UPDATED           It MUST contain the date and time of the most
                     recent domain-object modification. If the domain
                     object has never been modified, then the date and
                     time of domain-object creation have to be used.
                     Formatting in both cases according to section 2.3
                     of this document.

   ID                It MUST contain a unique ID according to section 4
                     of this document.
                     
4.  Unique ID

   A unique ID MUST either be according to the IANA registrar IDs
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/registrar-ids/registrar-ids.xhtml)
   where applicable or another unique registrar or reseller ID MUST be
   used.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Domain Inventory Report described in this document does not
   provide any security services.

8.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
