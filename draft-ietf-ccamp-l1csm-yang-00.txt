1. Introduction

   This document provides a YANG data model for L1VPN Connectivity
   Service Model (L1CSM). The intent of this document is to provide a
   transport service model exploiting Yang data model, which can be
   utilized by a client network controller to initiate a service
   request connectivity request as well as retrieving service states
   toward a transport network controller communicating with the client
   controller via a Netconf/Restconf interface.

   [RFC4847] provides a framework and service level requirements for
   Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs). It classifies service
   models as management-based service model, signaling-based service
   model (Basic Mode) and signaling and routing service model (Enhanced
   Mode).

   In the management-based service model, customer management systems
   and provider management systems communicate with each other.
   Customer management systems access provider management systems to
   request layer 1 connection setup/deletion between a pair of CEs.
   Customer management systems may obtain additional information, such
   as resource availability information and monitoring information,
   from provider management systems.  There is no control message
   exchange between a CE and PE.

   In the signaling-based service model (Basic Model), the CE-PE
   interface's functional repertoire is limited to path setup signaling
   only. In the Signaling and routing service model (Enhanced Mode),
   the CE-PE interface provides the signaling capabilities as in the
   Basic Mode, plus permits limited exchange of information between the
   control planes of the provider and the customer to help such
   functions as discovery of customer network routing information
   (i.e., reachability or TE information in remote customer sites), or
   parameters of the part of the provider's network dedicated to the
   customer.

   The primary focus of this document is to describe L1CS YANG model
   required for the instantiation of point-to-point L1VPN service. A
   L1VPN is a service offered by a core layer 1 network to provide
   layer 1 connectivity between two or more customer sites where the
   customer has some control over the establishment and type of the
   connectivity.

   The model presented in Section 3 is in consistent with [MEF-L1CS].



1.1. Deployment Scenarios

   Figure 1 depicts a deployment scenario of the L1VPN SDN control-
   based service model for an external customer instantiating L1 point-
   to-point connectivity to the provider.

   Figure 1: L1VPN SDN Controller/EMS/NMS-Based Service Model: External Customer


   With this scenario, the customer service orchestrator interfaces
   with the network SDN controller of the provider using Customer
   Service Model as defined in [Service-Yang].

   Figure 2 depicts another deployment scenario for internal customer
   (e.g., higher-layer service management department(s)) interfacing
   the layer 1 transport network department. With this scenario, a
   multi-service backbone is characterized such that each service
   department of a provider (e.g., L2/3 services) that receives the
   same provider's L1VPN service provides a different kind of higher-
   layer service.  The customer receiving the L1VPN service (i.e., each
   service department) can offer its own services, whose payloads can
   be any layer (e.g., ATM, IP, TDM). The layer 1 transport network and
   each service network belong to the same organization, but may be

   managed separately. The Service SDN Controller is the
   control/management entity owned by higher-layer service department
   (e.g., L2/3 VPN) whereas the Network SDN Controller is the
   control/management entity responsible for Layer 1 connectivity
   service. The CE's in Figure 2 are L2/3 devices that interface with
   L1 PE devices.

   The benefit is that the same layer 1 transport network resources are
   shared by multiple services.  A large capacity backbone network
   (data plane) can be built economically by having the resources
   shared by multiple services usually with flexibility to modify
   topologies, while separating the control functions for each service
   department. Thus, each customer can select a specific set of
   features that are needed to provide their own service [RFC4847].


1.2. Terminology

   Refer to [RFC4847] and [RFC5253] for the key terms used in this
   document.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o client

   o configuration data

   o server

   o state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o augment

   o data model

   o data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

1.3. Tree diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in Section x.


   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
   make the corresponding node conditional.

   o Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
   (read-write), and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
   denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
   marked with a colon (":").

   o Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
   shown.

5. Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241].  The NETCONF access
   control model [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are

   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true") These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.


6. IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG modules in the YANG
   Module

   Names registry [RFC7950]:
