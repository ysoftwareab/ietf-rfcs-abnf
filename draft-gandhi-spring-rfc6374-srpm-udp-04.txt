                draft-gandhi-spring-rfc6374-srpm-udp-04

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Segment
   Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies
   procedures for using UDP path for sending and processing probe query
   and response messages for Performance Measurement (PM).  The
   procedure uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 6374 for Performance
   Delay and Loss Measurement.  The procedure specified is applicable to
   SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes for both Links and end-to-end SR Paths
   including SR Policies measurements.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  SR takes advantage of the Equal-
   Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes, between
   transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR Policies
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are used to
   steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack of
   Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   [RFC6374] specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of performance metrics and can be used in SR
   networks with MPLS data plane [I-D.gandhi-mpls-rfc6374-sr].
   [RFC6374] addresses the limitations of the IP based performance
   measurement protocols as specified in Section 1 of [RFC6374].
   [RFC6374] requires data plane to support MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel Label (GAL) and Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh), which may
   not be supported on all nodes in the segment routing network.

   [RFC7876] specifies the procedures to be used when sending and
   processing out-of-band performance measurement probe response
   messages over an UDP return path for RFC 6374 based probe queries.
   [RFC7876] can be used to send out-of-band probe responses in both SR-
   MPLS and SRv6 networks for one-way performance measurement.

   For SR Policies, there are ECMPs between the source and transit
   nodes, between transit nodes and between transit and destination
   nodes.  RFC 6374 does not define handling for ECMP forwarding paths
   when used in SR networks.

   For two-way measurements for SR Policies, there is a requirement to
   specify a return path in the form of a Segment List in probe query
   messages that does not require on any SR Policy state information on
   the destination node.

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 with UDP Path for SR         June 2020


   This document specifies a procedure for sending and processing probe
   query and response messages using UDP paths for Performance
   Measurement in SR networks.  The procedure uses RFC 6374 defined
   mechanisms for Performance Delay and Loss Measurement and unless
   otherwise specified, the procedures from RFC 6374 are not modified.
   The procedure specified is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data
   planes.  The procedure can be used for both Links and end-to-end SR
   Paths including SR Policies measurements.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the querier node R1 initiates
   a probe query for performance measurement and the responder node R5
   sends a probe response for the probe query message received.  The
   probe response may be sent to the querier node R1 or to a controller
   node R100.  The nodes R1 and R5 may be directly connected via a Link
   enabled with Segment Routing or there exists a Point-to-Point (P2P)
   SR Path e.g.  SR Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] on
   node R1 with destination to node R5.  In case of Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP), SR Policy originating from source node R1 may terminate on
   multiple destination leaf nodes
   [I-D.voyer-spring-sr-replication-segment].

3.  Overview

   For one-way, two-way and round-trip delay measurements, the
   procedures defined in Section 2.4 and Section 2.6 of [RFC6374] are
   used.  For transmit and receive packet loss measurements, the
   procedures defined in Section 2.2 and Section 2.6 of [RFC6374] are
   used.  The procedures use probe messages with UDP path and do not use
   MPLS GAL.  Separate UDP destination port numbers are user-configured
   for delay and loss measurements from the range specified in

   [RFC8762].  The querier node uses the destination UDP port number
   following the guidelines specified in Section 6 in [RFC6335].  For
   both Links and end-to-end SR Policies, no PM session for delay or
   loss measurement is created on the responder node R5 [RFC6374].

   For Performance Measurement, probe query and response messages are
   sent as following:

   o  For Delay Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the
      congruent path of the data traffic by the querier node, and are
      used to measure the delay experienced by the actual data traffic
      flowing on the Links and SR Policies.

   o  For Loss Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the congruent
      path of the data traffic by the querier node, and are used to
      collect the receive traffic counters for the incoming link or
      incoming SID where the probe query messages are received at the
      responder node (incoming link or incoming SID needed since the
      responder node does not have PM session state present).

   The In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   mechanisms for SR-MPLS defined in [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr] and for
   SRv6 defined in [I-D.ali-spring-ioam-srv6] are used to carry PM
   information such as timestamp in-band as part of the data packets,
   and are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Example Provisioning Model

   An example provisioning model described in
   [I-D.gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm] is also applicable to the procedures
   defined in this document.

4.  Probe Query Message

   In this document, UDP path is used for Delay and Loss measurements
   for Links and end-to-end SR Policies for the probe messages defined
   in [RFC6374].  The user-configured destination UDP ports (separate
   UDP ports for different delay and loss message formats) are used for
   identifying the probe packets.

4.1.  Delay Measurement Probe Query Message

   The message content for Delay Measurement for probe query message
   using UDP header [RFC0768] is shown in Figure 1.  The DM probe query
   message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for
   DM.  The Destination UDP port can also be used as Source port for
   two-way delay measurement, since the message has a flag to
   distinguish between query and response.  The DM probe query message

   contains the payload format for delay measurement defined in
   Section 3.2 of [RFC6374].

                     Figure 1: DM Probe Query Message

   It is recommended to use the IEEE 1588v2 Precision Time Protocol
   (PTP) truncated 64-bit timestamp format as a default format as
   specified in Appendix A of [RFC6374], with hardware support.  As an
   alternative, Network Time Protocol (NTP) timestamp format can also be
   used [RFC6374].

4.2.  Loss Measurement Probe Query Message

   The message content for Loss measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC0768] is shown in Figure 2.  As shown, the LM probe
   query message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port
   number for LM.  Separate Destination UDP ports are used for direct-
   mode and inferred-mode loss measurements.  The Destination UDP port
   can also be used as Source port for two-way loss measurement, since
   the message has a flag to distinguish between query and response.
   The LM probe query message contains the payload format for loss
   measurement defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC6374].

   The message content for combined Loss/Delay measurement probe query
   message using UDP header [RFC0768] is shown in Figure 3.  As shown,
   the probe query message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP
   port number for combined LM/DM message format.  Separate Destination
   UDP ports are used for direct-mode and inferred-mode loss
   measurements.  The Destination UDP port can also be used as Source
   port for two-way loss/delay measurement, since the message has a flag
   to distinguish between query and response.  The probe query message
   contains the payload format for combined loss/delay measurement
   defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC6374].

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 with UDP Path for SR         June 2020


5.1.  One-way Measurement Mode

5.1.1.  Links and SR Policies

   In one-way performance measurement mode, the probe response message
   as defined in Figure 6 or Figure 7 is sent out-of-band to the querier
   node, for both Links and SR Policies.

   The querier node can receive probe response message back by setting
   its own IP address as Source Address of the header or by adding URO
   TLV in the probe query message and setting its own IP address in the
   IP Address in the URO TLV (Type=131) [RFC7876].  The "control code"
   in the probe query message is set to "out-of-band response
   requested".  The "Source Address" TLV (Type 130), and "Return
   Address" TLV (Type 1), if present in the probe query message, are not
   used to send probe response message.  In this delay measurement mode,
   as per Reference Topology, timestamps t1 and t2 are collected by the
   probes to measure one-way delay.

5.1.2.  Probe Response Message to Controller

   As shown in the Reference Topology, if the querier node requires the
   probe response message to be sent to the controller R100, it adds URO
   TLV in the probe query message and sets the IP address of R100 in the
   IP Address field and user-configured UDP port for DM and for LM in
   the UDP-Destination-Port field of the URO TLV (Type=131) [RFC7876].

5.2.  Two-way Measurement Mode

5.2.1.  Links

   In two-way performance measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   link, the probe response message as defined in Figure 6 or Figure 7
   is sent back on the congruent path of the data traffic to the querier
   node for Links.  In this case, the "control code" in the probe query
   message is set to "in-band response requested" [RFC6374].  In this
   delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology, timestamps t1, t2,
   t3 and t4 are collected by the probes to measure two-way delay.

5.2.2.  SR Policies

   In two-way performance measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   path, the probe response message is sent back on the congruent path
   of the data traffic to the querier node for end-to-end SR Policies
   measurements.  In this case, the "control code" in the probe query
   message is set to "in-band response requested" [RFC6374].

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 with UDP Path for SR         June 2020


5.2.3.  Return Path TLV

   For two-way performance measurement, the querier node can request the
   responder node to send a response message back on a given reverse
   path (e.g. co-routed path for two-way measurement).  Return Path TLV
   defined in [I-D.gandhi-mpls-rfc6374-sr] is used to carry reverse SR
   path information as part of the payload of the probe query message.

   Additional Sub-TLVs are defined in this document for the Return Path
   TLV for the following Types:

   o  Type (value TBA1): SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Path

   o  Type (value TBA2): SRv6 Binding SID
      [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] of the Reverse SR Policy

5.2.4.  Probe Response Message for SR-MPLS Policy

   The message content for sending probe response message on the
   congruent path of the data traffic for two-way end-to-end SR-MPLS
   Policy performance measurement is shown in Figure 8.  The SR-MPLS
   label stack in the packet header is built using the Segment List
   received in the Return Path TLV in the probe query message.

   The message content for sending probe response message on the
   congruent path of the data traffic for two-way end-to-end SRv6 Policy
   performance measurement is shown in Figure 9.  For SRv6 Policy using

5.3.  Loopback Measurement Mode

   The Loopback measurement mode defined in Section 2.8 of [RFC6374] can
   be used to measure round-trip delay of a bidirectional SR Path.  The
   IP header of the probe query message contains the destination address
   equals to the querier node address and the source address equals to
   the responder address.  Optionally, the probe query message can carry
   the reverse path information (e.g. reverse path label stack for SR-
   MPLS) as part of the SR header.  The responder node does not process
   the probe messages and generate response messages, and hence Loopback
   Request object (Type 3) is not required for SR.  In this delay

   measurement mode, as per Reference Topology, timestamps t1 and t4 are
   collected by the probes to measure round-trip delay.

6.  Performance Measurement for P2MP SR Policies

   For P2MP SR Policies [I-D.voyer-spring-sr-replication-segment], the
   procedure defined in [I-D.gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm] is also
   applicable to the procedures defined in this document (using the RFC
   6374 messages in the payload).

7.  ECMP Support for SR Policies

   For handling ECMP of SR Policies, the procedure defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm] is also applicable to the procedure
   defined in this document.

8.  Additional Probe Message Processing Rules

   The additional probe message processing rules defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm] are also applicable to the procedures
   defined in this document.

9.  Sequence Numbers

   The message formats for DM and LM [RFC6374] can carry either
   timestamp or sequence number but not both.  There are case where both
   timestamp and sequence number are desired for both DM and LM.
   Sequence numbers can be useful when some probe query messages are
   lost or they arrive out of order.  In addition, the sequence numbers
   can be useful for detecting denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on UDP

   [RFC6374] defines DM and LM probe query and response messages that
   can include one or more optional TLVs.  New TLV Type (value TBA3) is
   defined in this document to carry sequence number for probe query and
   response messages for delay and loss measurement.  The format of the
   Sequence Number TLV in unauthenticated mode is shown in Figure 10.

           Figure 10: Sequence Number TLV - Unauthenticated Mode

   o  The sequence numbers start with 0 and are incremented by one for
      each subsequent probe query packet.

   o  The sequence number are independent for DM and LM messages.

   o  The sequence number can be of any length determined by the querier
      node.

   o  The Sequence Number TLV is optional.

   o  The querier node SHOULD only insert one Sequence Number TLV in the
      probe query message and the responder node in the probe response
      message SHOULD return the first Sequence Number TLV from the probe
      query message and ignore the other Sequence Number TLVs if
      present.

   o  When Sequence Number TLV is added, the DM and LM messages SHOULD
      NOT carry sequence number in the timestamp field of the message.

9.2.  Sequence Number TLV in Authenticated Mode

   The probe query and response packet format in authenticated mode
   includes a key Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) ([RFC2104])
   hash.  Each probe query and response messages are authenticated by
   adding Sequence Number with Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
   TLV.  It can use HMAC-SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits (similarly to the
   use of it in IPSec defined in [RFC4868]); hence the length of the
   HMAC field is 16 octets.

   In authenticated mode, only the sequence number is encrypted, and the
   other payload fields are sent in clear text.  The probe packet MAY
   include Comp.MBZ (Must Be Zero) variable length field to align the
   packet on 16 octets boundary.

   The computation of HMAC field using HMAC-SHA1 can be used with the
   procedure defined in this document.  HMAC uses own key and the
   definition of the mechanism to distribute the HMAC key is outside the

   scope of this document.  Both the authentication type and key can be
   user-configured on both the querier and responder nodes.

   The format of the Sequence Number TLV in authentication mode is shown
   in Figure 11.

            Figure 11: Sequence Number TLV - Authenticated Mode

   o  This TLV is mandatory in the authenticated mode.

   o  The node MUST discard the probe message if HMAC is invalid.

   o  The Sequence Number follows the same processing rule as defined in
      the unauthenticated mode.

10.  Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring

   The procedure defined in this document for delay measurement can also
   be applied to liveness monitoring of Links and SR Paths.  Liveness
   failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe response
   messages are not received back at the querier node, where N is
   locally provisioned value.  Note that for one-way and two-way modes,
   the detection interval and scale for number of sessions need to
   account for the processing of the probe messages which are punted out
   of fast path in forwarding (to slow path or control plane), and re-
   injected on the responder node.

11.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in well-
   managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it assumes
   that a node involved in a measurement operation has previously

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 with UDP Path for SR         June 2020


   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far end
   responder node.  The security considerations described in Section 8
   of [RFC6374] are applicable to this specification, and particular
   attention should be paid to the last three paragraphs.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the querier node, of the counter or timestamp
   fields in received measurement response messages.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode defined in this
   document protects the data integrity of the probe messages.  SRv6 has
   HMAC protection authentication defined for SRH [RFC8754].  Hence,
   probe messages for SRv6 may not need authentication mode.
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access-control lists and firewalls.

12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the values for the following Sub-TLV
   Types for the Return Path TLV for RFC 6374 from the sub-registry
   "Return Path Sub-TLV Type" of the "MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV
   Object" registry contained within the "Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Parameters" registry set:

   o  Type TBA1: SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Path

   o  Type TBA2: SRv6 Binding SID of the Reverse SR Policy

   IANA is also requested to allocate the values for the following
   Sequence Number TLV Types for RFC 6374 to be carried in the probe
   query and response messages for delay and loss measurement from the
   "MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object" registry contained within
   the "Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters" registry set:

   o  Type TBA3: Sequence Number TLV in Unauthenticated Mode

   o  Type TBA4: Sequence Number TLV in Authenticated Mode
