Multi-cluster Edge System Architecture and Network Function Requirements
                   draft-dwon-t2trg-multiedge-arch-01

Abstract

   Artificial intelligence based IoT applications demand more massive
   computing resource through networks for the process of AI tasks.  To
   support these applications, some new technologies based an edge
   computing and fog computing are emerging.  Especially, the
   computation-intensive and latency-sensitive IoT applications such as
   augmented reality, virtual reality and AI based inference application
   is deployed with an edge computing and fog computing which are
   connected with cloud computing.  Recently, cluster-based edge system
   is deployed to extend computation capacity of an edge server.  The
   cluster-based edge system has the advantage that can enhace the
   resource scalability and availability in edge computing and fog
   computing.  In this draft, we present cluster-based edge system
   architecture and multi-cluster edge network topology that consists of
   multi-cluster edge system and core cloud.  Also, we define the
   network functions and network node to configurate and operate multi-
   cluster edge network collaboratively.

1.  Introduction

   Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based diverse IoT applications
   utilizing computing resources in cloud are emerging.  These
   applications are deployed with a computation offloading service which
   offloads the AI task in IoT devices to a cloud which has the enough
   computing resources.  However, this centralized processing service is
   not suitalbe for latency-sensitive and computing-intensive AI
   applications, since the unpredictable delay in the dynamic network
   and computing environments may occur due to the network congestion
   and the available computing resource may vary dynamically.

   Recently, as edge computing or fog computing evolve, some solutions
   are emerging to overcome the shortcoming of cloud computing.
   Specially, these solutions can quickly offload and deploy tasks for
   latency-sensitive and computation-intensive application to edge

   computing server because edge computing and fog computing is
   geographically closer to IoT devices and service users.  Also, IoT
   application can get better quality of service (QoS), such as fast
   task response time.  This means that edge computing has an advantage
   in terms of the development of computation-intensive and latency-
   sensitive intelligence IoT applications, such as augmented reality
   (AR), virtual reality (VR) and AI based inference
   application.[I-D.irtf-t2trg-iot-edge]

   Nevertheless, it is difficult for the edge computing itself to
   strictly satisfy the quality of service requested in the task due to
   the hardware constraints and the consideration of computing power in
   the edge computing server.  Thus, one solution proposes the
   collaborative processing that offloads the part of tasks to the
   remote cloud or neighbor edge server.  This solution adopts the
   collaborative resource allocation in a distributed computing manner
   between the edge computing server and the cloud and between the edge
   computing servers.  Also, to extend the computation capacity of an
   edge computing server, cluster-based edge system is deployed and
   extended with Kubernetes technology.  Kubernetes is an open-source
   platform which is optimized for configuring the infrastructures to
   deploy the cluster-based edge system.  In this draft, we present
   cluster-based edge system architecture and multi-cluster edge network
   topology that consists of multi-cluster edge system and core cloud.
   Also, we define the network functions and network node to configurate
   and operate multi-cluster edge network collaboratively.

3.1.  The cluster-based edge system architecture

   The cluster-based edge system architecture is shown in figure below.
   The cluster edge system consists of an edge controller (a master
   node) and N edge nodes (worker nodes) which can execute an offloaded
   computation task and application service provision.  At the case of a
   computation offloading for tasks, on the procedures of a offloading
   task, the mobile node (MN) requests task offloading to the cluster-
   based edge system and then the edge controller determines appropriate
   edge node (worker) deployed with the application which can perform
   the offloaded task with a scheduler.  After that, the task offloading
   is performed at the selected edge node, the edge controller collects
   and then responses the task results to the mobile node requesting
   task offloading.

3.2.  Multi-cluster edge network topology

   The multi-cluster edge network topology is shown in figure below.  It
   provides an edge network which can support a distributed computing
   environment for collaboration among cluster-based edge systems and
   between multi-cluster edge systems and core cloud.  The following
   network functions are required to smoothly provide distributed
   computing services in a multi-cluster edge network environment.

4.  Collaborative computation service

   In multi-cluster edge network topology, two collaborative computation
   models are possible.  One is vertical collaborative computation.  The
   other is horizontal collaborative computation.  Vertical
   collaborative computation is a collaboration service between a multi-
   cluster edge network and the core cloud, and horizontal collaborative
   computation is a collaboration service between cluster edge systems
   in a multi-cluster edge network.  For at all, to provide
   collaborative computation, high-speed network connection is required
   between cluster edge systems.  This can be configurated with a
   tunneling protocol.  In addition, a storage, or a cache for sharing
   data and operating service collaboratively should be configured
   between cluster edge systems.  Thus, a function for multi-cluster
   edge network management is required.  Also, the function to
   monitoring resource state in multi-cluster edge network and a
   scheduler for resource allocation is necessary and a computation
   resource, a storage and a cache in multi-cluster edge network shall
   be driven and managed collaboratively.
