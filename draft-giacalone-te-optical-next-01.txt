Abstract

   This memo defines extensions to OSPFv3 [2] to provide support for
   Network Engineering. This set of extensions is termed Network
   Engineering eXTensions for OSPFv3, or NEXT. The term network
   engineering was chosen to impart NEXT's wide scope of functionality.

   NEXT enables OSPFv3 to discern and advertise holistic state and
   capability data. NEXT may be used to build and present complex "best
   network paths" to outside protocols such as CR-LDP and RSVP-TE.
   NEXT may also be used to support other (perhaps unforeseen) advanced
   topological and administrative processes.

   NEXT is specifically designed to support Traffic Engineering and
   Optical Routing while providing new features and functionality. Note
   that NEXT does not intend to alter native packet routing.

   Since NEXT inter-operates with OSPFv3, it is essentially network
   protocol independent. Therefor, when used with OSPFv3, NEXT can
   support advanced services without limiting networks to IPv4.

   Please send comments to ospf@discuss.microsoft.com.

1 Overview

   This document details extensions to OSPFv3 [2] called NEXT. NEXT can
   be used to add very granular network engineering capabilities to
   OSPFv3 networks. To accomplish this, NEXT provides a wealth of
   interface, link, and device capability and state information to
   OSPFv3 or other protocols. The intent of NEXT is to enable the
   selection of shortest paths through networks based on sets of
   advanced network state criteria. NEXT aims to provide unified support
   to both Traffic Engineering and Lambda switching protocols.

   While NEXT builds on functionality presented in other works, it adds
   many new features, presents new philosophical possibilities, and is
   intended for use with OSPFv3.

   Since it operates with OSPFv3, which is essentially network protocol
   independent, NEXT can be used to enable all networks to become
   extensively self aware. NEXT's independence from IP may be used to
   support the domain (all routed) IP optical model.

   Although, NEXT focuses on traffic engineering (TE) [3,4], Multi
   Protocol lambda Switching (MPLmS) [5,6], and Protection Wavelength

   Routing it is specifically intended to support changing requirements
   and technologies in the future.

   A core philosophical premise of NEXT is that it may effect the core
   topology building process of OSPFv3, or it may be used to build
   separate "shadow" topologies. In the former, NEXT can be used a basis
   to make sophisticated decisions within OSPFv3. In the later,
   OSPFv3/NEXT can serve to build repositories of detailed information
   to enhance supplementary protocols.

   NEXT supports advanced intra-area and inter-area routing.

   It is hoped that NEXT will become a focal point for the distribution
   of advanced network information, enhancing OSPFv3 (and other
   protocols) while enabling complex deterministic services to be
   implemented.

   Note that in addition to allowing existing QOS protocols, such as
   RSVP, to provide new types of QoS, NEXT can enhance these protocols,
   by reducing the possibility of "crank-back". Extensions to other
   protocols to make use of NEXT information may be needed.

2 Terminology

   -Link State Database (LSDB): In NEXT, this represents the collection
   of NEXT LSAs.

   -Topology: Depending on the mode in which NEXT is operating, the
   topology is a data structure representing the OSPF router's view of
   the network. There may be a single NEXT LSDB supporting a single OSPF
   topology, or there may be many of each. For example, if a composite
   view of the network is desired, there is no reason to have more than
   a single OSPF topology. However, when it's desirable to view the
   network as subsets of, for example least delay and also highest
   bandwidth paths, there may be a single NEXT LSDB, but multiple
   topologies. These NEXT modes, composite and shadow, are detailed
   elsewhere in this document.

3 Basic Functionality

   To provide network engineering functionality, NEXT adds new LSAs to
   OSPFv3. As (generally) conceived with other OSPFv3 LSAs, NEXT LSAs
   will be encapsulated in IPv6 packets.

   As with other protocols and technologies, NEXT is based on a
   hierarchical series of type/length/value (TLV) triplets which reside
   in NEXT OSPFv3 LSAs. The TLV is the most basic component of NEXT.

   NEXT TLVs may carry sub-TLVs, each conveying more specific data. The
   ability of TLVs to hierarchically nest other TLVs is described in
   terms of levels, Level-1 being the first, or highest TLV level.

Internet Draft             NEXT for OSPFv3                August, 2000



   NEXT's TLVs convey information to describe the OSPFv3 network's
   resource state for the purpose of manipulating data forwarding. That
   is, NEXT provides information pertaining to current and potential
   network operation to allow administrative control of the way data
   traverses the network. NEXT network topology/s may not be
   synchronized with the regular OSPFv3 routed topology.

   The information provided by NEXT LSAs and TLVs may be used to build
   channels, lightpaths, MPLS LSPs, RSVP reservations, a combination of
   these, or for other purposes. Note that NEXT can be used to make
   protocols like RSVP more deterministic as resources for path requests
   would be known in advance, and avoidance of "crank back" would be
   possible.

3.1 Protected Wavelength Routing

   NEXT allows the reservation of alternate standby paths to a specific
   destination. This function may be necessary in Lambda routing and
   MPLmS network to insure that redundant lightpath bandwidth is
   available in the event of a network reconvergence. Protected
   Wavelength Routing is supported by the Shared Risk Link Group TLV
   (described elsewhere). Using this TLV, it's possible to determine,
   select and or reserve paths which are physically separate, and share
   no single point of failure in the network.

3.2 Limiting Resource Consumption

   This memo outlines several methods by which the impact NEXT
   has on network resources can be minimized.

3.2.1 Controlling Implementations

   To minimize memory and processing requirements, implementations do
   not need to support more than 8 NEXT sub-level (level 2 and 3) TLVs
   at one time. Supporting more than this number at one time is
   optional.

   Additionally, there is a minimalistic set of NEXT TLVs required for
   interoperability and compatibility. These TLVs are specified
   elsewhere in this memo.

3.2.2 Separating data into LSAs

   Next splits dynamic TLVs (like averages) into separate LSAs, so that
   less aggregate TLV data needs to be retransmitted when network
   changes occur.

3.2.3 Balancing Benefits and Utilization




Expires February 2001                                         [Page 5]
Internet Draft             NEXT for OSPFv3                August, 2000


   Network operators must determine which TLVs are needed, balancing the
   benefits of next data against resource consumption. Only critical
   TLVs should be enabled.

   NEXT assumes that network operators only enable a subset of all TLVs
   in an implementation.

3.2.4 Control Channels

   To minimize the amount of data injected into a network, NEXT fully
   supports the assignment of a single lambda (or portion thereof) as a
   control channel. This control channel runs OSPF/NEXT, and represents
   lamdbas residing on the fiber which don't need to run OSPF/NEXT. This
   functionality is implemented by the DCC level-3 TLV, and the Total
   and Available Spectra level-2 TLVs, described elsewhere in this memo.

3.2.5 Edge-Mode Operation

   Edge-mode NEXT operation can dramatically reduce the memory and
   processing requirements of interior (UNI/NNI) routing devices. When
   NEXT is being used to provide data for building explicit paths (such
   as E-LSPs or lightpaths) only edge devices need to store NEXT LSAs
   and (possibly) compute topology. Therefor, only edge devices need
   additional resources for these purposes. Note that all devices
   running NEXT must originate and forward NEXT LSAs

3.2.6 Path calculation on demand

   NEXT implementations may (if desired) calculate topology when needed
   by other protocols, thus reducing processing overhead.

3.3 Maintaining Network Stability

   NEXT does not intend to alter packet-by-packet (native OSPF) routing.
   NEXT provides additional data to other protocols for uses outside the
   scope of this memo. Therefor, routing oscillations caused by NEXT are
   limited to the protocols that use NEXT data (for example CR-LDP).
   Normal traffic follows normal OSPFv3 routing when NEXT is in use.

   NEXT best topology data may be used by outside protocols to route
   resource reservation requests, or set up explicit network paths.
   Careful design and implementation of outside protocols will increase
   network stability. For example, outside protocols using NEXT best
   data to set up explicit routes should be very diligent in tearing
   down and rebuilding existing paths. Once a resource-reserved path is
   set up, general NEXT path metric changes should not automatically
   cause existing reserved paths to change.

   NEXT defines several TLVs which must not be re-originated when router
   event counters are cleared. These TLVs must be re-originated via
   commands designed to trigger this action. This applies to any TLV

Internet Draft             NEXT for OSPFv3                August, 2000


   which polls device or interface counters which can be manually reset.
   For example, the reliability TLV, which polls interface error
   counters, must not be resent when those counters are rest.

   Special care must be taken with the general origination intervals of
   several TLVs, including those based on counters (like errors) or
   truly dynamic states (like delay). Polling intervals must be manually
   configurable. All counter based TLVs will default to a 5 minute
   counter polling average.

   Additionally, [10] describes a methods for smoothing the variance
   between differing metrics. Using this technique, it may be possible
   to limit oscillations.

3.4 Topology and Computation

   Whether NEXT LSAs result in a separate topological views of the
   OSPFv3 network, a modified singular view, or a composite (totally
   singular)view is TBD.

   For example, NEXT may result in separate topological views if the
   network based on some, or all, of it's state parameters. This mode of
   NEXT operation is termed "shadow mode"

   Alternatively, NEXT may be used to modify the normal topology
   process, building dense (complex) composite metrics, in a mode called
   NEXT "composite mode".

   Although NEXT LSA data may be used to provide enhanced composite
   metric data for path selection, implementations of NEXT must be
   capable of providing separate and distinct sets of topology data. For
   example, NEXT must be able to differentiate between paths that offer
   low delay, high bandwidth, or low loss.

   The specification of recommended and required NEXT TLV state sets
   (combinations) for conformance and use in building separate
   topologies is TBD.

   To calculate topological views of the network, NEXT uses the metric
   computation presented in [10].

   Although one intent of NEXT is to provide best-paths based on complex
   state and capability data, directly access to the NEXT LSAs
   database/s must be permitted.

3.5 NEXT Time and Origination Parameters

   Normally, routers will originate NEXT LSAs as
   contents change, and whenever otherwise required by OSPF (an LSA
   refresh, for example)[3].

   There are, however, several issues regarding resource consumption.
   For more information, please refer to the section entitled limiting
   resource consumption.

   Upon reception of a changed NEXT LSA, routers should update their
   NEXT database/s.

   TLVs not enabled MUST not be added to LSAs or nested within other
   TLVs.

NEXT LSA Formats

   NEXT LSAs follow the basic OSPFv3 packet and LSA header constructs.
   Each NEXT LSA is contained within a standard OSPFv3 packet header
   [2]:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Additionally, each NEXT LSA begins with the standard OSPFv3 LSA
   Header [2]:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   NEXT defines new OSPFv3 LSAs, including:

   -The NEXT-LSA. The NEXT-LSA carries data that is more likely to be
   somewhat static. For example, administrative metrics, which once
   assigned tend not to change frequently.



Expires February 2001                                         [Page 8]
Internet Draft             NEXT for OSPFv3                August, 2000


   -The NEXT-Dynamic-LSA. The NEXT-Dynamic-LSA carries data that is
   likely to change often. For example, the NEXT-Dynamic-LSA will carry
   information such as average state data, which will tend to change
   every polling interval. NEXT splits static and dynamic data into
   separate LSAs in order to reduce protocol overhead.

   Both LSAs carry data which pertains to interface and node state and
   capability.

   All NEXT LSAs will be defined with the allocation unused LS-type [2]
   bit space.

   NEXT follows the same rules for LSA origination, flooding, and
   reception as those presented in [2]

   Within the LS type of each NEXT LSA header, the U bit must be set to
   1 (store and flood). The flooding scope bits S1 and S2 must be set to
   0 and 1 (Area Scope) respectively.

   Options field allocation in NEXT LSAs on the LSAs it references is
   TBD.

   Special use of NEXT LSA ID fields to impart meaning are TBD. Until
   that time, the LSA ID field carries the same meaning as the intra-
   area-prefix LSA [2]

NEXT TLVs

   As noted earlier, the actual payload of each next LSA is comprised of
   a nested series of TLVs. The first layer of TLVs are referred to as
   level-1 TLVs, the following level as level-2, and so on. The use of
   TLVs enables NEXT to provide modularity and therefor versatility and
   extensibility.

   Both NEXT LSAs, the NEXT-LSA and the NEXT-Dynamic-LSA, use the same
   TLV architecture.

   The basic NEXT TLV architecture is :

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type             |             length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                            Value...                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   As in [3], the length field defines the TLV's value length field in
   bytes. A TLV with no value field would have a corresponding length of
   zero. TLVs must be padded to a four-byte alignment and padding is not
   included in the length field. For example, a three byte value would

Internet Draft             NEXT for OSPFv3                August, 2000


   have a length of three, but the total size of the TLV would be eight
   bytes). All Nested TLVs must also be 32-bit aligned.

   Unrecognized TLV types must be ignored. All TLVs types between 1 and
   9, and above 131000 are reserved for NEXT protocol extensions. All
   TLV types between 400 and 6000 are reserved for protocol specific
   functions. All TLV types between 16384 and 32767 are reserved for
   vendor-specific extensions. Base NEXT TLVs must be assigned with
   types at intervals of five. All other undefined TLV type codes are
   reserved for future assignment. TLVs values will be assigned to allow
   changes to be easily made.

   All reserved fields are currently not utilized and should be set to
   zero.

Level-1 TLV Interaction

   As the level-1 TLVs don't, by themselves, carry state and capability
   data, there doesn't appear to be interaction issues between level-1
   TLVs.

NEXT level-2 and level-3 TLVs

   Each level-1 TLV may carry nested level-2 TLVs, each conveying more
   specific data. Level-2 TLVs must conform the same architectural and
   operative constraints as level-1 TLVs. Note level-2 TLVs may, in
   turn, carry further nested level-3 TLVs.

   The number of TLVs subordinate to a a higher level TLV may vary, but
   it must be possible for a single de TLV to be sent. The specific
   number of TLVs related to a higher Level TLV should permit optimum
   network convergence. Unnecessary TLVs should not be sent.

   NEXT LSAs (the NEXT-LSA and the NEXT-Dynamic-LSA) DO NOT define the
   same level-2 TLVs.

   Implementations of NEXT must allow values to be manually overridden.

   There are several TLVs which must not be re-originated when router
   event counters are cleared. These TLVs must be re-originated via
   commands designed to trigger this action.

   Special care must be taken with the general origination intervals of
   several TLVs. These TLVs include those that are based on counters
   (like errors) or truly dynamic states (like delay).

   Sub TLVs will be ordered as appropriate, and there may be instances
   when certain TLVs must be ordered in a specific fashion.

NEXT Level-3 TLVs

   As noted, each level-2 TLV may carry nested level-3 TLVs, which
   convey more specific data. Level-3 TLVs must conform to the same
   architectural and operative constraints as other TLVs. Note level-3
   TLVs may, in turn, carry further nested TLVs.

   The number of Level-3 TLVs subordinate to a Level-2 TLV may vary, but
   it must be possible for a single de TLV to be sent. The specific
   number of Level-3 TLVs related to a Level-2 TLV should permit optimum
   network convergence. Unnecessary TLVs should not be sent.

   Implementations of NEXT must allow values to be manually overridden.

   There are several TLVs which must not be re-originated when router
   event counters are cleared. These TLVs must be re-originated via
   commands designed to trigger this action.

   Special care must be taken with the general origination intervals of
   several TLVs. These TLVs include those that are based on counters
   (like errors) or truly dynamic states (like delay).

   Implementations of NEXT must allow values to be manually overridden

TLVs for the NEXT-LSA

   This section provides information regarding TLVs which are only used
   with the NEXT-LSA. NEXT-LSA related TLVs provide state and capability
   data which is more static in nature.

NEXT-LSA level-1 TLVs

   Level-1 TLVs follow the OSPFv3 LSA header in the NEXT-LSA. NEXT
   currently defines the following level-1 TLVs for the NEXT-LSA:

       Type   Description
       ---------------------------------------------------
       10     The NEXT-interface TLV
       15     The NEXT-node TLV

   Inter area and external path handling is TBD. It may be possible to
   support this by using referencing [2] or by adding a new level-1 TLV.

The NEXT-Interface level-1 TLV

   Each NEXT-Interface TLV granularly describes a single device
   interface in the network. The NEXT-interface TLV contains basic
   values and a set of nested level-2 TLVs. Note that an interface may
   be a physical or virtual link, or some type of composite as in WDM.

   The number of NEXT-interface TLVs carried in each LSA may vary, but
   it must be possible for a single NEXT-interface TLV to be sent. The
   specific number of NEXT-interface TLVs contained in an LSA should
   permit optimum network convergence. For example, unnecessary TLVs
   should not be sent. All device interfaces may be described by
   multiple TLVs residing in a single LSA if warranted.

   The base values contained in the NEXT-interface level-1 TLV are
   extremely similar to parts of the Intra-Area-Prefix LSA [2]. The
   architecture of the NEXT-interface TLV is:

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The combined values of Referenced LS type, Referenced Link State ID,
   and Referenced Advertising Router Identify the router-LSA or network-
   LSA and interface which NEXT-interface information should be
   associated with. If Referenced LS type is 1, the prefixes are
   associated with a router-LSA, Referenced Link
   State ID should be 0 and Referenced Advertising Router should be
   the originating router's Router ID. If Referenced LS type is 2,
   the prefixes are associated with a network-LSA, Referenced Link
   State ID should be the Interface ID of the link's Designated
   Router and Referenced Advertising Router should be the Designated
   Router's Router ID [2].

   By utilizing LSA referencing [2], the NEXT-interface LSA does not
   need to advertise neighboring routers and/or links to determine and
   identify redundant topologies.

   A possible use for the reserved space in the base NEXT-Interface LSA
   data is as a vector (identifier) for technologies or protocols.

   The remainder of the NEXT-interface TLV is comprised of level-2 TLVs.

The NEXT-Node level-1 TLV

   Each NEXT-Node TLV granularly describes a system which is running
   OSPFv3 and NEXT. The NEXT-Node TLV may contain basic value/s, but it
   will contain a set of nested level-2 TLVs.

   Only a single NEXT-Node TLV may be carried in an LSA. Unnecessary
   and/or disabled TLVs should not be sent.

   The NEXT-Node TLV can be utilized to view OSPFv3 network entities
   (i.e. routers) as devices with inherent states, similar to the way
   that links have been viewed traditionally. For example, NEXT-Node
   TLVs may be used to inject router CPU or environmental state data
   into a topology. Note that the possibility of using nodal states in
   topological computation was previously not possible. This usage of
   Node TLVs is called "nodal" mode.




Expires February 2001                                        [Page 13]
Internet Draft             NEXT for OSPFv3                August, 2000


   To the Contrary, NEXT-Node TLVs may be used as "macro" TLVs,
   adjusting the value all TLVs of a certain type. In this case, the
   Nodal TLVs can be viewed as extended interface TLVs. This usage of
   Node TLVs is called "macro" mode.

   Using NEXT-Node TLVs in nodal mode to describe the interior state of
   devices is very topologically significant, as it presents a new set
   of pseudo paths through the OSPFv3 network. However, this approach
   (the nodal approach) is likely to be somewhat complex.

   Using NEXT-Node TLVs in macro mode as an interface TLV adjustment
   mechanism is simple, however, this approach leads to the complex
   possibility of the representation all NEXT-Interface TLVs in Node-
   TLVs becoming desirable.

   The architecture of the NEXT-Node TLV is:

        0                   1                   2                   3

Link Media Level-2 TLV

   As in [6], the link media TLV represents the bit encoding format and
   the bit transmission rate of the interface. Generally, this TLV will
   be used to list supported transport methods within the same routing
   construct, as currently may occur in the optical domain [6].

   As defined in [6] the value of the link media TLV is listed by a 16
   bit media type field. The second field defines the lowest priority at
   which that media type is available as in [6], but is 16 bits in
   length.

   The following values for the media type field of this TLV are as in
   [6]:

Shared Risk Link Group Level-2 TLV

   As in [6], the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) TLV permits the
   advertisement and bonding of links to SRLGs. SRLGs are configured to
   indicate the use of share resources whose failure may affect all
   links in the set [6].

   A link may belong to multiple SRLGs.  Thus the SRLG TLV
   describes a list of SRLGs that the link belongs to.  An SRLG is
   identified by a 32 bit number that is unique within an IGP domain
   [6].

   The value in the SRLG TLV is an unordered list of 32 bit numbers that
   are the SRLGs that the link belongs to [6].

   The Administrative Metric TLV specifies a supplemental interface

   greater significance. The default value should be zero (the lowest
   metric).

Bandwidth level-2 TLV

   The Bandwidth Level-TLV specifies the overall (Total) outbound
   interface bandwidth in IEEE floating point format. Whether this
   metric should be automatically computed is TBD. To provide uniform
   and eased network administration, the value of this TLV is specified
   in kiloBITS per second.

   When an OSPFv3 link is a MPLmS control channel as specified by Type
   TLVs, the bandwidth should be the sum of the bandwidths of all
   lambdas of all the fibers in the IP link at that priority level [6].

MTU-Interleave Level-2 TLV
   The MTU-Interleave TLV specifies the maximum output transmission unit
   for the interface. This TLV may be useful in networks where abnormal
   MTUs are present, as in the case of packet interleaving, often used
   in multi-service networks. The value of this TLV is specified in the
   number of BYTEs that comprise the MTU.

Dilation level-2 TLV

   The Dilation TLV permits the specification of protocol overhead
   values for an interface. This TLV may be useful in for calculating
   true interface bandwidths. For example, an ATM/SONET interface may
   have more average associated protocol overhead than a POS interface,
   etc. This TLV may also be useful in networks that implement tunneling
   and/or trunking. The value of this TLV is specified in KiloBITs per
   second. This value should be determined by referring to a table
   listing percentage of bandwidth used for protocol overhead per
   protocol "stack". A table listing these values is TBD.

   This TLV may adjust bandwidth TLVs, or present data for separate
   topological computation.

Total Spectra level-2 TLV

   The Total Spectra TLV specifies the total number of lambdas that can
   be injected into the link by the device originating this LSA.
   Additionally, this TLV lists the range/s of the wavelengths that can
   be used. This TLV might be used in conjunction with interfaces that
   specify the use control channels (i.e. links running OSPFv3 on a
   single connection, but layer 2 lambda switching on others). The
   specification of a control channel is perform in a separate TLV. The
   Total Spectra TLV can provide potential wavelength state information
   in MPLmS networks.

NEXT-interface TLV related level-3 TLVs

   NEXT Level-3 TLVs follow (and are part of) NEXT level-2 TLVs. NEXT
   currently defines the following level-3 TLVs for NEXT-interface
   Level-2 TLVs:

       Type   Description         Associated Level-2 TLV
       ---------------------------------------------------

       10     Data Control Channel       Link Type
       15     Link subtype               Link Type

Data Control Channel (DCC) level-3 TLV

   The Link subtype TLV identifies this interface as a data control
   channel. An interface sending this TLV is representing other, non
   OSPF interfaces in OSPF. Furthermore, this TLV specifies whether
   other TLVs will represent all non OSPF interfaces on this fiber as a
   single unit, or if all other TLVs in the parent NEXT-Interface level-
   1 TLV refer to a specific non OSPF channel (lambda). The second usage
   is useful when non OSPF channels (lambdas) on a fiber have differing
   states and capabilities.

   The DCC interface will be identified by the physical interface ID
   derived from the referenced router links LSA. Therefor, this TLV can
   support non OSPF channels on the local link, as well as those that
   are on separate links in the same device.

   When the NEXT-Interface TLV is used to represent channels or lambdas
   with differing state and capabilities it's necessary to list the non
   OSPF channel or lambda by interface index.

   Because interface ID is used in the DCC TLV, NEXT allows control
   channels to operate on physically separate links from data channels.

   This TLV appears as:

        0                   1                   2                   3

   Interface level-1 TLV refer to a conglomeration of the non OSPF
   channels or lambdas.

   The B bit when set, indicates that the parent NEXT-Interface TLV
   represents a DCC, and that the values of all other TLVs are a
   represent a SINGLE non OSPF channel or lambda. This non OSPF channel
   or lambda is referenced by Non OSPF Interface Index.

Link Subtype level-3 TLV

   The Link subtype TLV identifies access characteristics and
   capabilities of the interface. It is subordinate to the NEXT-
   Interface Level-2 Link Type TLV. As based in [6] NEXT currently
   defines the following values for the type field of this TLV:

       Type   Description

   Detailed descriptions of types and TLV architecture is as in [6],
   except for the following:

   DCC indicates that the interface or Lambda can and will be used by
   OSPFv3, and perhaps Lambda signaling [5]. It indicates that
   information presented by NEXT may be a composite of other
   connections, which do not operate at the network layer. This type may
   have some functional similarities to type LSC.

   This section provides information regarding TLVs which are only used
   with the NEXT-Dynamic-LSA. NEXT-Dynamic-LSA related TLVs provide
   state and capability data which is likely to change frequently.

NEXT-Dynamic-LSA level-1 TLVs

   Level-1 TLVs follow the OSPFv3 LSA header. NEXT currently defines the
   following level-1 TLVs:

NEXT-Dynamic-Interface TLV Related level-2 TLVs

   NEXT Interface Level-2 TLVs follow (and are part of) NEXT level-1
   Interface TLVs. NEXT currently defines the following level-2 TLVs for
   the Level-1 Interface TLV when viewed in the NEXT-Dynamic-LSA:

Maximum Reservable Bandwidth level-2 TLV

   The Bandwidth Level-TLV specifies the outbound interface bandwidth
   that may be reserved, in IEEE floating point format. To provide
   uniform and eased network administration, the value of this TLV is
   specified in KiloBITs per second.

   When an OSPFv3 link is a MPLmS control channel as specified by Type
   TLVs, the reservable bandwidth should be the sum of the bandwidths of

Unreserved Bandwidth level-2 TLV

   The Unreserved Bandwidth level-2 TLV specifies the outbound interface
   bandwidth not yet reserved in IEEE floating point format. Data
   pertaining to class levels is TBD, however iterative issuance of
   unreserved bandwidth TLVs per class may be possible by re-allocating
   reserved bit space. The sum of each must be less than or equal to the
   maximum reservable bandwidth. To provide uniform and eased network
   administration, the value of this TLV is specified in KiloBITs per
   second.

   When an OSPFv3 link is a MPLmS control channel as specified by Type
   TLVs, the unreserved bandwidth should be the sum of the unused
   bandwidths of all lambdas of all the fibers in the IP link at that
   priority level allocated for reservation but not yet allocated [6].

Interface Utilization Average level-2 TLV

   The Interface Utilization Average TLV specifies the outbound
   interface utilization. The Utilization Average may be useful in
   situations where no reservations have been made, when reservations
   have been made but do not behave as expected, or when reservation is
   not configured. A possible use of the Utilization Average TLV would
   be soft (deterministic) over subscription. The utilization average

Delay Average level-2 TLV

   The Delay Average TLV specifies the overall average (mean) outbound
   delay in milliseconds. The Delay Average may be useful in situations
   where path selection must be dependant on latency. This TLV may be
   utilized when, for example the network contains slow or congested
   links, or when traffic shaping is enabled. It would be beneficial to
   calculate the delay automatically. A method for determining delay is
   TBD, although one is presented in this document. Without an automatic
   system for determining delay, it is possible to use a manual value.
   Any automatic delay calculation system must balance granularity with
   LSA origination rates; the delay average should be determined via an

Delay Variation Average level-2 TLV

   The Delay Variation average TLV specifies the average minimum and
   maximum outbound delay in milliseconds. The delay variation average
   may be useful in situations where path selection must be dependant on
   jitter. It would be beneficial to calculate the interface delay
   variation automatically, however a method for accomplishing this is
   TBD. It may be possible to use the minimum and maximum rates using
   the delay mechanism introduced in this memo. Until an automatic
   method is specified, a possible solution is to use a manual value.
   Any automatic delay variation calculation system must balance
   granularity with LSA origination rates; the delay variation average
   should be determined via an adjustable polling cycle. Special care
   must be taken to insure that the received rate of LSAs generated due

Reliability level-2 TLV

   The Reliability TLV specifies perceived interface reliability. This
   TLV may provide a decay metric. This TLV may be useful in situations
   where path selection must be dependant on:

      -Loss
      -Link technology fault tolerance (LTFT)
      -Errors

   Loss regards output loss rates. It would be beneficial to calculate
   loss automatically; an obvious solution being to parse output drop
   counters. For brevity, loss rates will be mapped to pre-determined
   values. A table mapping loss and values is TBD.

   LTFT regards the fault tolerance of the link technology. For example,
   SONET may be more fault tolerant that Frame Relay, which is more
   fault tolerant than T1. It would be beneficial to calculate LTFT
   automatically, based on interface type. Specifications of types and
   LTFT values are TBD.

   Errors regards error event rates on an interface. Note that unless
   input errors are measured this value may not properly represent link
   state. A list of error counters that should be parsed is TBD. All
   interface error rates should be combined into a composite value,
   which will then be mapped to pre-determined threshold values. A table
   mapping errors and values is TBD.

   The rate at which this TLV, and therefor an LSA is generated must
   specifically be adjustable. Special care must be taken to insure that
   the received rate of LSAs generated is sustainable. This TLV should
   not be re-issued specifically due changes in the polling average.

System Error Level-2 TLV

   The System Error TLV specifies the occurrence of a critical system
   event, allowing that state to be injected into topology. This TLV
   would be useful in situations where it would be beneficial to select
   paths around compromised components. For example, this TLV might
   allow paths to avoid a device with a failed cooling system. It would
   be beneficial to send this TLV automatically. It may be possible to
   send this TLV when system error SNMP traps are sent. To accomplish
   this, a table listing general types of system errors and values could
   be used to install value in this TLV. Thereafter, the value in the
   TLV could be used to devalue other states and metrics, or it could be
   used to effect topology directly. Any automatic system for issuing
   this TLV must limit LSA origination rates. Special care must be taken
   to insure that the received rate of LSAs generated due to this level-
   2 TLV is sustainable.

   This TLV should not be re-issued specifically due changes in the
   polling average.

NEXT Delay Calculation

   There are several methods for calculating interface (and link delays)
   in NEXT.

   One logical solution is for routers operating with a higher RID to
   "poll" other routers at some interval. If the routers have
   synchronized internal clocks then the polling router might build a
   packet which includes time stamp. When the target router receives
   this packet, it can compare the time stamp with it's own clock.
   Additionally, the target router would "flip" the network addresses
   and send the exact (unchanged) packet back to the polling router. The
   polling router could compare the time stamp with its now incremented
   internal clock to find the differential. Next, the router might
   divide the time differential equally to find the one-way delay. For
   added accuracy serialization and estimated processing times might be
   factored.

   The polling packet described might be implemented as an OSPFv3 LSA
   with link Local scope, or extending this principle, OSPFv3's hello
   packet might be modified to support time stamp polling.

   It may be beneficial to measure delay (using the polling method) for
   each class of service supported.

   Note that the use of special CPU time allocations or queuing for
   OSPFv3 packet processing should be taken into account.

   For time synchronization, OSPFv3 NEXT routers polling for delay might
   also use NTP.

Issues To Be Decided (TBD)

   -Best practices for allocating TLV types should be considered. This
    must include TLV hierarchies.
   -Inter area and External support
   -OSPFv3 Options field assignments
   -IPv6 COS TLVs
   -Interoperation between level-2 TLVs, and between level-1 and level-2
    TLVs.
   -Additional optical capabilities and state data
   -Diff-Serv support
   -Virtual Link Support
   -Increase bounds and half-lives

Internet Draft             NEXT for OSPFv3                August, 2000


        for Internet Traffic Engineering", July 2000.

A Compatibility

   Since NEXT uses new LSA/s, routers not running NEXT will simply
   ignore and flood its messages. Additionally, NEXT uses OSPFv3
   flooding scopes to limit its LSAs effect to areas of the network.

   When a only subset of the devices in a network run NEXT, it should
   still be possible to benefit from its use.

   When routers run NEXT and are building separate topological databases
   OSPFv3 will, generally, operate as when not running NEXT.

   If NEXT is used to build composite metrics, the premise for path
   selection may change greatly, as NEXT provides an abundance of new
   information.

A.1 NEXT operation with resource class/color and COS

   When enabled, NEXT advertises data for each class/color and/or COS on
   a per interface/node basis. Put simply, each class/color and/or COS
   can be viewed as another instance of an interface or node.

A.2 Basic Compatibility Criteria

   To be compatible with this memo, NEXT implementations must support
   the following minimum set of NEXT specifications:

   -The NEXT-LSA
        -The NEXT Interface Level-1 TLV
           -NEXT Interface Level-2 TLVs
               -Link type
               -Link Media
               -Shared Risk Link Group
               -Administrative Metric
               -Bandwidth
               -Resource class/color
        -The NEXT Node Level-1 TLV
           -NEXT Node Level-2 TLVs
               -System Resource class/color

   -The NEXT-Dynamic-LSA
        -The NEXT-Dynamic-Interface level-1 TLV
           -NEXT-Dynamic-Interface level-2 TLVs
               -Maximum Reservable Bandwidth
               -Unreserved Bandwidth
               -Interface Utilization Average
               -Interface Delay Average
               -Reliability
        -The NEXT-Dynamic-Node level-1 TLV

               -System Error

A.3 Unnumbered Links

   Since OSPFv3 separates network topology data and addressing
   information advertisement, NEXT can operate on unnumbered links with
   no additional implications. OSPFv3 refers to interfaces using network
   protocol independent identifiers.

B NEXT State and the end-to-end argument

   It appears that the end-to-end argument [9] does not apply to NEXT as
   it is not an end-to-end protocol.

   Furthermore, [9] specifies "that the network maintains some state
   information: routes, QoS guarantees that it makes, session
   information where that is used in header compression, compression
   histories for data compression, and the like." Fortunately, NEXT
   operates in the areas of routing, switching, and QoS and it therefor
   operates within this specification.

   While NEXT provides abundant state information to other intermediate
   protocols (for example, MPLS) it makes efforts to minimize unneeded
   information advertisement, and therefor complies with [9] in that the
   volume of state data be minimized.


C Security Considerations

   NEXT does not appear to provide risk in addition to that already
   present in OSPF.
