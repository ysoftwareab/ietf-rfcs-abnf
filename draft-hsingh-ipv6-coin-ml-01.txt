               New IPv6 Multicast Addresses for Switch ML
                      draft-hsingh-ipv6-coin-ml-01

Abstract

   Recently, in-network aggregation to scale distributed machine
   learning (ML) has been presented.  A network switch implementation
   uses IPv4 broadcast messages from switch to the hosts to send updates
   to all workers.  IPv6 does not support broadcast addresses.  This
   document proposes, IPv6 implementations use the IPv6 link-local all-
   nodes multicast address, until a new IPv6 link-local multicast
   address is assigned by IANA for switch to hosts multicast
   communications.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   New computing in the network for ML uses IPv4 broadcast
   communications between switch to hosts.  [Switch-ML].  With IPv6,
   multicast communications would be used.  This document proposes a new
   well-known multicast address be defined for such communications.
   Until a new address is defined, the IPv6 link-local all-nodes
   multicast address may be used.  By definition, a layer-2 switch
   operates in the link-local subnet.  Thus, the IPv6 link-local
   multicast address defined by this document suffices for switch to
   host multicast communications.

3.  Additional Information

   It is common when new networking protocols such as RPL and Babel were
   developed, each protocol requested IANA for a new IPv6 link-local
   multicast address for use.  Switch ML does not have a protocol
   defined by IETF just yet and may never define one.  However,
   experiments in switch ML are already using IP or layer-2 broadcast
   communications.  For IPv6, switch ML experiments should use IPv6
   link-local multicast communications.  A new IPv6 link-local multicast
   address for switch ML facilitates efficient filtering by hosts.

   If a switch is configured in layer-3 mode and if switch ML
   communicates with hosts to another IPv6 subnet, an IPv6 Site-Local
   Scope Multicast address is recommended for communications.

4.  Security Considerations

   SEND [RFC3971] is recommended to secure switch to host ML
   communications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a new IPv6 link-local multicast
   address for use by network ML.  This multicast address name is
   Switch_ML_Host.  An interface on the host MUST join this well-known
   multicast address.

   Additionally, IANA is requested to assign a new IPv6 Site-Local Scope
   Multicast address for switch ML to host communication across IPv6
   subnets.  If configured to do so, an interface on the host MUST join
   this well-known multicast address.
