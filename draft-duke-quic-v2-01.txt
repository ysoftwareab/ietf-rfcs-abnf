Abstract

   This document specifies QUIC version 2, which is identical to QUIC
   version 1 except for some trivial details.  Its purpose is to combat
   various ossification vectors and exercise the version negotiation
   framework.  Over time, it may also serve as a vehicle for needed
   protocol design changes.

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF
   mailing list quic@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains
   the draft: https://github.com/martinduke/draft-duke-quic-v2.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC [QUIC-TRANSPORT] has numerous extension points, including the
   version number that occupies the second through fifth octets of every
   long header (see [I-D.ietf-quic-invariants]).  If experimental
   versions lower in frequency, and QUIC version 1 constitutes the vast
   majority of QUIC traffic, there is the potential for middleboxes to
   ossify on the version octets always being 0x00000001.

   Furthermore, version 1 Initial packets are encrypted with keys
   derived from a universally known salt, which allow observers to
   inspect the contents of these packets, which include the TLS Client
   Hello and Server Hello messages.  Again, middleboxes may ossify on
   the version 1 key derivation and packet formats.

   Finally [QUIC-VN] provides two mechanisms for endpoints to negotiate
   the QUIC version to use.  The "incompatible" version negotiation
   method can support switching from any initial QUIC version to any
   other version with full generality, at the cost of an additional
   round-trip at the start of the connection.  "Compatible" version
   negotiation eliminates the round-trip penalty but levies some
   restrictions on how much the two versions can differ semantically.

Internet-Draft                   QUICv2                       April 2021


   QUIC version 2 is meant to mitigate ossification concerns and
   exercise the version negotiation mechanisms.  The only change is a
   tweak to the inputs of some crypto derivation functions to enforce
   full key separation.  Any endpoint that supports two versions needs
   to implement version negotiation to protect against downgrade
   attacks.

   This document may, over time, also serve as a vehicle for other
   needed changes to QUIC version 1.

   [I-D.duke-quic-version-aliasing] is a more robust, but much more
   complicated, proposal to address these ossification problems.  By
   design, it requires incompatible version negotiation.  QUICv2 enables
   exercise of compatible version negotiation mechanism.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Changes from QUIC Version 1

   QUIC version 2 endpoints MUST implement the QUIC version 1
   specification as described in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], [I-D.ietf-quic-tls],
   and [I-D.ietf-quic-recovery], with the following changes:

   *  The version field of long headers is 0x00000002.  Note: Unless
      this document is published as an RFC, implementations should use
      the provisional value 0xff010001, which might change with each
      edition of this document.

   *  The salt used to derive Initial keys in Sec 5.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] changes to

   initial_salt = 0xa707c203a59b47184a1d62ca570406ea7ae3e5d3

   *  The labels used in [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] to derive packet protection
      keys (Sec 5.1), header protection keys (Sec 5.4), Retry Integrity
      Tag keys (Sec 5.8), and key updates (Sec 6.1) change from "quic
      key" to "quicv2 key", from "quic iv" to "quicv2 iv", from "quic
      hp" to "quicv2 hp", and from "quic ku" to "quicv2 ku," to meet the
      guidance for new versions in Section 9.6 of that document.

   *  The key and nonce used for the Retry Integrity Tag (Sec 5.8 of
      [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] change to:

4.  Version Negotiation Considerations

   QUIC version 2 endpoints SHOULD also support QUIC version 1.  Any
   QUIC endpoint that supports multiple versions MUST fully implement
   [QUIC-VN] to prevent version downgrade attacks.

   Note that version 2 meets that document's definition of a compatible
   version with version 1.  Therefore, v2-capable servers MUST use
   compatible version negotiation unless they do not support version 1.

   As version 1 support is more likely than version 2 support, a client
   SHOULD use QUIC version 1 for its original version unless it has out-
   of-band knowledge that the server supports version 2.

5.  Ossification Considerations

   QUIC version 2 provides protection against some forms of
   ossification.  Devices that assume that all long headers will contain
   encode version 1, or that the version 1 Initial key derivation
   formula will remain version-invariant, will not correctly process
   version 2 packets.

   However, many middleboxes such as firewalls focus on the first packet
   in a connection, which will often remain in the version 1 format due
   to the considerations above.

   Clients interested in combating firewall ossification can initiate a
   connection using version 2 if they are either reasonably certain the
   server supports it, or are willing to suffer a round-trip penalty if
   they are incorrect.

6.  Security Considerations

   QUIC version 2 introduces no changes to the security or privacy
   properties of QUIC version 1.

   The mandatory version negotiation mechanism guards against downgrade
   attacks, but downgrades have no security implications, as the version
   properties are identical.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA add the following entry to the QUIC
   version registry:
