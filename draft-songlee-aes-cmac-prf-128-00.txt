Abstract
   
   Some implementations of IP Security (IPsec) may want to use a
   pseudo-random function derived from the Advanced Encryption Standard
   (AES).  This memo describes such an algorithm, called AES-CMAC-
   PRF-128.

1. Introduction

   [AES-CMAC] describes a method to use the Advanced Encryption Standard
   (AES) as a message authentication code (MAC) whose output is 128 bits
   long.  128 bits output is useful as a long-lived pseudo-random (PRF)
   in either IKE version 1 or version 2.  Both versions of IKE use the
   PRF to create keys in a fashion that is dependent on the length of
   the output of the PRF.  This memo specify AES-CMAC use as a PRF whose
   output is 128 bits, named AES-CMAC-PRF-128.


2.  The AES-CMAC-PRF-128 Algorithm

   The AES-CMAC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical to AES-CMAC defined 
   in [AES-CMAC].

   The test vectors in appendix of [AES-CMAC] can be used for
   AES-CMAC-PRF-128 as well.


3.  Security Considerations

   The security provided by AES-CMAC-PRF-128 is based upon the strength
   of AES.  At the time of this writing, there are no known practical
   cryptographic attacks against AES or AES-CMAC-PRF-128.

   As is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its strength
   lies in the security of the key management mechanism, the strength of
   the associated secret key, and upon the correctness of the
   implementations in all of the participating systems.  [AES-CMAC]
   contains test vectors to assist in verifying the correctness of the
   AES-CMAC-PRF-128 code.
