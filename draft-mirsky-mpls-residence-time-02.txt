1.  Introduction

   Time synchronization protocols, Network Time Protocol version 4
   (NTPv4) [RFC5905] and Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Version 2, a.k.a.
   IEEE-1588 v.2, can be used to syncronized clocks across network
   domain.  In some scenarios calculation of time packet of time
   syncronization protocol spends within a node, called Residence Time,
   can improve accuracy of clock syncronization.  This document defines
   new Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) that can be used in Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network to measure Residence Time
   over Label Switched Path (LSP).  Transport of packets of a time
   synchronization protocol over MPLS domain is outside of scope of this
   document.

2.  Residence Time Measurement

   Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks [RFC6374] can be
   used to measure one-way or two-way end-to-end propagation delay over
   LSP or PW.  But none of these metrics is useful for time
   syncronization across a network.  For example, PTPv2 uses "residence
   time", time it takes for a PTPv2 event packet to transit a node.  The
   residence times are accumulated in the correctionField of the PTP
   event messages or of the associated follow-up messages (or Delay_Resp
   message associated with the Delay_Req message) in case of two-step
   clocks.  The residence time values are specific to each output PTP
   port and message.

   Note the delay of propagation over a link connected to a port
   receiving the PTP event message is handled by IEEE 1588
   [IEEE.1588.2008] by means of specific messages, Pdelay_Req and
   Pdelay_Resp,or Delay_Req and Delay_Resp depending on the applicable
   delay mechanism, peer-to-peer or delay request-response mechanism
   respectively.

Internet-Draft         Residence Time Measurement              June 2014


   This document proposes mechanism to accumulate packet residence time
   from all LSRs that support the mechanism across the particular LSP.

3.  G-ACh for Residence Time Measurement

   RFC 5586 [RFC5586] and RFC 6423 [RFC6423] extended applicability of
   PW Associated Channel (ACH) [RFC5085] to LSPs.  G-ACh presents
   mechanism to transport OAM and other control messages and trigger
   their processing by arbitrary transient LSRs through controlled use
   of Time-to-Live (TTL) value.

       Figure 1: G-ACh packet format for Residence Time Measurement

   The Version field is set to 0, as defined in RFC 4385 [RFC4385].  The
   Reserved field must be set to 0 on transmit and ignored on receipt.
   The RTM G-ACh field, value to be allocated by IANA, identifies the
   packet as such.  The Scratch Pad field is 8 octets in length and is
   used to accumulate the residence time spent in LSRs transited by the
   packet on its path from ingress LSR to egress LSR.  Its format is
   IEEE double precision and its units are nanoseconds.

   The Type field identifies type of Value that the TLV carries.  IANA
   will be asked to create sub-registry in Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Parameters Registry called "MPLS RTM TLV Registry".  The
   Length field is number of octets of the Value field.  The optional
   Value field may be used to carry a packet of a given time
   synchronization protocol.  If the packet carried in the RTM message,
   then it accordingly identified by distinct Type, and may be NTP
   [RFC5905] or PTP [IEEE.1588.2008].  It is important to note that the
   packet may be authenticated or encrypted and carried over MPLS LSP

   edge to edge unchanged while residence time being accumulated in the
   Scratch Pad field.  The TLV MUST be included in the RTM.

4.  Control Plane Theory of Operation

   A router will announce its support for RTM in a new sub-TLV, the RTM
   Capable TLV which will be defined in a subsequent version of this
   document, for the router capabilities TLV defined in RFC 4970 (OSPF)
   [RFC4970] and RFC 4971 (IS-IS) [RFC4971].

   The operation of RTM depends upon TTL expiry to deliver an RTM packet
   from one RTM capable LSR to the next along the path from ingress LSR
   to egress LSR, which means that an RTM capable LSR needs to be able
   to compute a TTL which will cause the expiry of an RTM packet on the
   next RTM capable LSR.

   However, because of Equal Cost Multipath, labels distributed by LDP
   do not instantiate a single path between a given ingress/egress LSR
   pair but rather a graph and different flows will take different paths
   through this graph.  This means one doesn't know the path that RTM
   packets will take or even if they all take the same path.  So, in an
   environment in which not all routers in an IGP domain support RTM, it
   is effectively impossible to use TTL expiry to deliver RTM packets
   and hence RTM cannot be used for LSPs instantiated using LDP.  In the
   special but important case of environment in which all routers in an
   IGP domain support RTM, setting the TTL to 1 will always cause the
   expiry of an RTM packet on the next RTM capable downstream LSR and
   hence in such an environment, RTM can be used for LSPs instantiated
   using LDP.

   Generally speaking, RTM is more useful for an LSP instantiated using
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] because the LSP's path can be known.

4.1.  RSVP-TE Control Plane Operation to Support RTM

   An ingress LSR that wishes to perform RTM along a path through an
   MPLS network to an egress LSR verifies that the selected egress LSR
   supports RTM via the egress LSR's advertisement of the RTM Capable
   TLV.  In the Path message that the ingress LSR uses to instantiate
   the LSP to that egress LSR it places initialized Record Route and RTM
   Set (see below) Objects, which tell the egress LSR that RTM is
   desired for this LSP.

   In the Resv message that the egress LSR sends in response to the
   received Path message, it includes initialized Record Route and RTM
   Set objects.  The latter object will be defined in a subsequent
   version of this document and it contains an ordered list, from egress
   LSR to ingress LSR, of the RTM capable LSRs along the LSP's path.



Mirsky, et al.           Expires January 1, 2015                [Page 5]


Internet-Draft         Residence Time Measurement              June 2014


   Each such LSR will use the use the ID of the first LSR in the RTM Set
   Object in conjunction with the Record Route Object to compute the hop
   count to its downstream RTM capable LSR.  It will also insert its ID
   at the beginning of the RTM Set Object before forwarding the Resv
   upstream.

   After the ingress LSR receives the Resv, it will begin sending RTM
   packets to the first RTM capable LSR on the LSP's path.  Each RTM
   packet has its Scratch Pad field initialized and its TTL set to
   expire on that LSR.

   It should be noted that RTM can also be used for LSPs instantiated
   using [RFC3209] in an environment in which all routers in an IGP
   support RTM.  In this case the RTM Set Object is not used.

5.  Data Plane Theory of Operation

   After instantiating an LSP for a path using RSVP-TE [RFC3209] as
   described in Section 4.1 or if this is the special case of
   homogeneous RTM-capable IP/MPLS domain discussed in the last
   paragraph of Section 4, ingress LSR MAY begin sending RTM packets to
   the first RTM capable downstream LSR on that path.  Each RTM packet
   has its Scratch Pad field initialized and its TTL set to expire on
   the next downstream LSR.  Each RTM capable LSR that receives an RTM
   packet records the time at which it receives that packet as well as
   the time at which it transmits that packet; this should be done as
   close to the physical layer as possible.  Just prior to sending that
   packet, it takes the difference between those two times and adds it
   to the value in the Scratch Pad field.  Note, for the purpose of
   calculating a residence time, a free running clock may be sufficient,
   as, for example, 4.6 ppm accuracy leads to 4,6 ns error for residence
   time in the order of 1 ms.

   The RTM capable LSR also sets the RTM packet's TTL to expire on the
   next RTM capable downstream from it LSR.

   The egress LSR may then use the value in the Scratch Pad field to
   perform time correction.  For example, the egress LSR may be a PTP
   Boundary Clock synchronized to a Master Clock and will use the value
   in the Scratch Pad Field to update PTP's Correction Field.

6.  Applicable PTP Scenarios

   The proposed approach can be directly integrated in a PTP network
   based on delay request-response mechanism.  The RTM capable LSR nodes
   act as end-to-end transparent clocks, and typically boundary clocks,
   at the edges of the MPLS network, use the value in the Scratch Pad

   field to update the correctionField of the corresponding PTP event
   packet prior to performing the usual PTP processing.

   Under certain assumptions the proposed solution in a network where
   peer delay mechanism is used is also possible.  The solution in this
   case requires the definition of a specific protocol to be used to
   calculate the link delays according to a peer delay link measurement
   approach.  This is not described in this version of the draft.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  New RTM G-ACh

   IANA is requested to reserve a new G-ACh as follows:

          +-------+----------------------------+---------------+

                  Table 1: New Residence Time Measurement

7.2.  New RTM TLV Registry

   IANA is requested to create sub-registry in Generic Associated
   Channel (G-ACh) Parameters Registry called "MPLS RTM TLV Registry".
   All code points within this registry shall be allocated according to
   the "IETF Review" procedure as specified in [RFC5226] This document
   defines the following new values RTM TLV type

                  +-------+-------------+---------------+
                  | Value | Description | Reference     |
