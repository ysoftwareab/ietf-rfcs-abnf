   relay, and ATM over MPLS become more common, the ability to detect, 
   handle and diagnose control and data plane defects becomes 
   critical. 

   Detection and specification of how to handle those defects is not 
   only important because such defects may not only affect the 
   fundamental operation of an Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   network, but also because they MAY impact service level specification 
   commitments for customers of that network.

   This document describes requirements for user and data
   plane operations and management for MPLS.
   These requirements have been gathered
   from network operators who have extensive experience deploying
   MPLS networks, similarly some of these 
   requirements have appeared in other documents. This draft specifies
   Operations and Management requirements for Multi-Protocol Label 
   Switching, as well as for applications of Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching such as pseudowire voice and virtual private network 
   services. Those interested in specific issues relating to 
   instrumenting    MPLS for Operations 
   and Management purposes are directed to the Multi-Protocol Label 
   Switching Architecture specification.


1. Introduction

   This document describes requirements for user and data
   plane operations and management (OAM) for Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (MPLS). These requirements have been gathered
   from network operators who have extensive experience deploying
   MPLS networks. This draft specifies OAM requirements
   for MPLS, as well as for applications of MPLS.

   No specific mechanisms are proposed to address these
   requirements at this time.  The goal of this draft is to
   identify a commonly applicable set of requirements for MPLS
   OAM at this time. Specifically, a set of requirements that apply 
   to the most common set of MPLS networks deployed by service
   provider organizations today. These requirements can then be used 
   as a base for network management tool development and to guide 
   the evolution of currently specified tools, as well as the
   specification of OAM functions that are intrinsic to protocols
   used in MPLS networks.

   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list
   at mpls@lists.ietf.org.

2.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   Defect:   Any error condition that prevents an LSP
             functioning correctly. For example, loss of an
             IGP path will most likely also result in an LSP
             not being able to deliver traffic to its
             destination. Another example is the breakage of
             a TE tunnel.  These MAY be due to physical
             circuit failures or failure of switching nodes
             to operate as expected.

             Multi-vendor/multi-provider network operation typically
             requires agreed upon definitions of defects (when it is 
             broken and when it is not) such that both recovery 
             procedures and service level specification impacts can 
             be specified.

   Head-end Label Switch Router (LSR): The beginning of a label 
          switched path.

   Probe-based-detection: Active measurement using a tool such as 
          LSP ping.

   Collecting traffic: Passive measurement of network traffic.   

   Head-end Label Switching Router (LSR): The beginning of a label 
          switched path. A head-end LSR is also referred to as
          an Ingress Label Switching Router.

   Probe-based-detection: Active measurement using a tool such as 
          LSP ping.

   Collecting traffic: Passive measurement of network traffic.


   propagation latency: delay added by the propagation of the packet 
                        through the link (fixed value that depends on 
                        the distance of the link and the propagation 
                        speed).

   transmission latency: delay added by the transmission of the packey 
                         over the link i.e. the time it takes put the 
                         packet over the media (value that depends of 
                         the link throughput and packet length).

   processing latency: delay added by all the operations related to the
                       switching of labeled packet (value is node 
                       implementation specific and may are considered 
                       as fixed and constant for a given equipment).

   queuing/buffering latency: delay caused by packet queuing (value is
                              variable since depending on the packet 
                              arrival rate in addition to the
                              dependance on the packet length and the 
                              link throughput).

   node latency: delay added by the network element resulting from of 
                 the sum of the transmission, processing and queuing/
                 buffering latency

   one-hop delay: fixed delay experienced by a packet to reach the next 
                  hop reesulting from the of the propagation latency, 
                  the transmission latency and the processing latency.

   minimum path latency: sum of the one-hop delays experienced by the 
                         packet when travelling from the ingress to the 
                         egress LSR.

   variable path latency (jitter): sum of the delays caused by the 
                                   queuing latency experienced by the

Internet Draft           MPLS OAM Requirements          December 2004



   MPLS OAM has been tackled in numerous Internet drafts.
   However as of this writing, existing drafts focus on single 
   provider solutions or focus on a single aspect of the MPLS 
   architecture or application of MPLS. For example, the use 
   of RSVP or LDP signaling and defects MAY be covered in some 
   deployments, and a corresponding SNMP MIB module exists to 
   manage this application; however, the handling of defects 
   and specification of which types of defects are interesting 
   to operational networks MAY not have been created in concert 
   with those for other applications of MPLS such as L3 VPN.  
   This leads to inconsistent and inefficient applicability 
   across the MPLS architecture, and/or requires significant 
   modifications to operational procedures and systems in order 
   to provide consistent and useful OAM functionality which do 
   not create inconsistencies with existing solutions. As MPLS 
   has matured, relationships between providers has become more 
   complex. Furthermore, the deployment of multiple concurrent 
   applications of MPLS is common place, leading to a need to 
   consider broader and more uniform solutions, rather than very 
   specific ad hoc point solutions.

4. Requirements

   The following sections enumerate the OAM requirements
   gathered from service providers who have deployed MPLS
   and services based on MPLS networks. Each requirement is
   specified in detail to clarify its applicability. 
   Although the requirements specified herein are defined by 
   the IETF, they have been harmonized with requirements
   gathered by other standards bodies such as the ITU [Y1710].
      

   4.1 Detection of Label Switch Path Defects

   The ability to detect defects in a broken Label Switch Path 
   (LSP) SHOULD not require manual hop-by-hop troubleshooting of
   each LSR used to switch traffic for that LSP. For example,
   it is not desirable to manually visit each LSR along the data 
   plane path used to transport an LSP; instead,this function 
   SHOULD be automated and able to be performed at some operator
   specified frequency from the origination point of that LSP.
   This implies solutions that are interoperable as to allow for
   such automatic operation. Furthermore, the automation of path 
   liveliness is desired in cases where large numbers of LSPs might 
   be tested. For example, automated ingress LSR to egress LSR testing 
   functionality is desired for some LSPs. The goal is to detect LSP 
   path defects before customers do, and this requires detection of 
   LSP defects in a "reasonable" amount of time. One useful 
   definition of reasonable is both predictable and consistent. 




MPLS Working Group             Expires June 2005             [Page 5]

Internet Draft           MPLS OAM Requirements          December 2004



   Synchronization of detection time bounds by tools used to detect 
   broken LSPs is required. Failure to specifying defect detection 
   time bounds may result in an ambiguity in test results. If the 
   time to detect is known, then automated responses can be specified 
   both with respect to and with regard to resiliency and service 
   level specification reporting. Further, if synchronization of 
   detection time bounds is possible, an operational framework can be 
   established that can guide the design and specification of MPLS 
   applications.
   
   Although ICMP-based ping [RFC792] can be sent through an LSP, the 
   use of this tool to verify the defect free operation of an LSP
   has the potential for returning erroneous results (both positive and 
   negative). For example, failures may occur when 
   inconsistencies exist within the IP or MPLS forwarding tables, 
   in the MPLS control and data planes or LSP. Failures may also result
   from defects with the reply path (i.e., a reverse path does not 
   exist) used to return a response to a test message. As an example 
   of a false positive, consider the case where the MPLS data 
   plane flows through a network node using a different output line 
   card than the data plane uses to reach the next-hop neighbor. Also 
   assume that although the control plane is functional, the data 
   plane on the output line card where data traffic is programmed to 
   exit the device is defective. Now, if an LSP is signaled using 
   this node, any test based solely on the control plane's view of the 
   world (i.e., ICMP-based) will return with a false positive result 
   because although the control plane traffic at the node in the 
   example would be forwarded correctly, the actual data plane 
   switching at the node in the example would misroute or drop any 
   traffic transmitted onto that LSP.  An example of a false 
   negative case would be when a functioning return path does not 
   exist. In this case, neither a positive nor a negative reply 
   will be received by the sender. Therefore any detection mechanisms
   that depend on receiving status via a return path SHOULD provide 
   multiple return options with the expectation that one of them will 
   not be impacted by the original defect.

   The OAM packet MUST follow exactly the customer data path in order 
   to reflect path liveliness used by customer data. Particular cases 
   of interest are forwarding mechanisms such as equal cost multipath 
   (ECMP) scenarios within the operator's network whereby flows are 
   load-shared across parallel (i.e., equal IGP cost) paths. Where 
   the customer traffic MAY be spread over multiple paths, what is 
   required is to be able to detect failures on any of the path 
   permutations.  Where the spreading mechanism is payload specific, 
   payloads need to have forwarding that is common with the traffic 
   under test. Satisfying these requirements introduces complexity 
   into ensuring that ECMP connectivity permutations are exercised, 
   and that defect detection occurs in a reasonable amount of time.

  4.2 Diagnosis of a Broken Label Switch Path

   The ability to diagnose a broken LSP and to isolate the failed 
   component (i.e., link or node) in the path is required. For 
   example, note that specifying recovery actions for misbranching 
   defects in an LDP network is a particularly difficult case. 
   Diagnosis of defects and isolation of the failed component is 
   best accomplished via a path trace function which can return the 
   the entire list of LSRs and links used by a certain LSP (or at 
   least the set of LSRs/links up to the location of the defect) is 
   required. The tracing capability SHOULD include the ability to 
   trace recursive paths, such as when nested LSPs are used. This 
   path trace function MUST also be capable of diagnosing LSP 
   mis-merging by permitting comparison of expected vs. actual 
   forwarding behavior at any LSR in the path. The path trace 
   capability SHOULD be capable of being executed from both the 
   head-end Label Switch Router (LSR) and MAY permit downstream 
   path components to be traced from an intermediate mid-point LSR.
   Additionally, the path trace function MUST have the ability to 
   support equal cost multipath scenarios described above in 
   section 4.1.

  4.3 Path characterization

   The path characterization function is the ability to reveal details 
   of LSR forwarding operations. These details can then be compared 
   later during subsequent testing relevant to OAM functionality.
   This would include but is not limited to:

     - consistent use of pipe or uniform time to live (TTL) models by 
       an LSR [RFC3443].
     - sufficient details that allow the test origin to 
       excersize all path permutations related to load spreading
       (e.g. ECMP).
     - stack operations performed by the LSR, such as pushes, pops,
       and TTL propagation at penultimate hop LSRs.


   4.4 Service Level Agreement Measurement

   Mechanisms are required to measure the diverse aspects of Service
   Level Agreements which include:
     - defect free forwarding. The service is considered to be
       available and the other aspects of performance measurement 
       listed below have meaning, or the service is unavailable and 
       other aspects of performance measurement do not.
     - latency - amount of time required for traffic to transit
       the network
     - packet loss
     - jitter - measurement of latency variation



MPLS Working Group             Expires June 2005             [Page 7]

Internet Draft           MPLS OAM Requirements          December 2004




   Such measurements can be made independently of the user traffic
   or via a hybrid of user traffic measurement and OAM probing.

   At least one mechanism is required to measure the number
   of OAM packets. In addition, the ability to measure the qualitative 
   aspects of LSPs such as jitter, delay, latency and loss MUST 
   be available in order to determine whether or not the traffic for
   a specific LSP are traveling within the operator-specified 
   tollerances. 

   Any method considered SHOULD be capable of measuring the latency 
   of an LSP with minimal impact on network resources.  See section 
   2.1 for definitions of the various qualitative aspects of LSPs.


   4.5 Frequency of OAM Execution

   The operator MUST have the flexibility to configure OAM
   parameters insofaras to meet their specific operational 
   requirements. 

   This includes the frequency of the execution of any OAM
   functions. The capability to synchronize OAM operations is required
   as to to permit consistent measurement of service level agreements.
   To elaborate, there are defect conditions such as misbranching or 
   misdirection of traffic for which probe-based detection mechanisms 
   that incur significant mismatches in the probe rate MAY result in 
   flapping.  This can be addressed either by synchronizing the rate
   or having the probes self-identify their probe rate.

   One observation would be that wide-spread deployment of MPLS, common
   implementation of monitoring tools and the need for 
   inter-carrier synchronization of defect and service level 
   specification handling will drive specification of OAM parameters 
   to commonly agreed on values and such values will have to be 
   harmonized with the surrounding technologies (e.g. SONET/SDH, 
   ATM etc.) in order to be useful. This will become particularly 
   important as networks scale and misconfiguration can result in 
   churn, alarm flapping etc.


  4.6 Alarm Suppression, Aggregation and Layer Coordination

   Network elements MUST provide alarm suppression functionality that 
   prevents the generation of superfluous generation of alarms by 
   simply discarding them (or not generating them in the first place), 
   or by aggregating them together, and thereby greatly reducing the 
   number of notifications emitted.  When viewed in conjuction with 
   requirement 4.7 below, this typically requires fault notification 



MPLS Working Group             Expires June 2005             [Page 8]

Internet Draft           MPLS OAM Requirements          December 2004



   to the LSP egress that 
   MAY have specific time constraints if the application using the LSP 
   independently implements path continuity testing (for example ATM 
   I.610 Continuity check (CC)[I610]).  These constraints apply to 
   LSPs that are monitored. The nature of MPLS applications allows 
   for the possibility to have multiple MPLS applications attempt to 
   respond to defects simultaneously. For example, layer-3 MPLS VPNs 
   that utilize Traffic Engineered tunnels, where a failure occurs on 
   the LSP carrying the Traffic Engineered tunnel. This failure would 
   affect he VPN traffic that uses the tunnel's LSP. Mechanisms are 
   required to coordinate network response to defects.


   4.7 Support for OAM Interworking for Fault Notification

   An LSR supporting the interworking of one or more networking 
   technologies over MPLS MUST be able to translate an MPLS defect 
   into the native technology's error condition. For example, errors 
   occurring over a MPLS transport LSP that supports an emulated 
   ATM VC MUST translate errors into native ATM OAM Alarm Indication 
   Signal (AIS) cells at the termination points of the LSP. The 
   mechanism SHOULD consider possible bounded detection time 
   parameters, e.g., a "hold off" function before reacting as to 
   synchronize with the OAM functions. 
   One goal would be alarm suppression by the upper layer using 
   the LSP. As observed in section 4.5, this requires that MPLS 
   perform detection in a bounded timeframe in order to initiate 
   alarm suppression prior to the upper layer independently 
   detecting the defect.

   4.8 Error Detection and Recovery.

   Recovery from a fault by a network element can be facilitated by 
   MPLS OAM procedures. These procesures will detect a broader range 
   of defects than that of simple link and node failures.
   Since MPLS LSPs may span multiple routing areas and service provider 
   domains, fault recovery and error detection should be possible 
   in these configuration as well as in the more simplifed 
   single-area/domain configurations.

   Recovery from faults SHOULD be automatic. It is a requirement that 
   faults SHOULD be detected (and possibly corrected) by the network 
   operator prior to customers of the service in question detecting 
   them.


   4.9 Standard Management Interfaces

   The wide-spread deployment of MPLS requires common information 
   modeling of management and control of OAM functionality. This is 



MPLS Working Group             Expires June 2005             [Page 9]

Internet Draft           MPLS OAM Requirements          December 2004



   reflected in the the integration of standard MPLS-related MIBs 
   (e.g. [RFC3813][RFC3812][RFC3814]) for fault, statistics and 
   configuration management. These standard interfaces provide 
   operators with common programmatic interface access to
   operations and management functions and their status.

   4.10  Detection of Denial of Service Attacks 

   The ability to detect denial of service (DoS) attacks against the 
   data or control planes MUST be part of any security management 
   related to MPLS OAM tools or techniques.

   4.11 Per-LSP Accounting Requirements

   In an MPLS network, service providers (SPs) can measure traffic 
   from an LSR to the egress of the network using some MPLS related 
   MIBs, for example. This means that it is a reasonable to know how 
   much traffic is traveling from where to where (i.e., a traffic 
   matrix) by analyzing the flow of traffic. Therefore, traffic 
   accounting in an MPLS network can be summarized as the following 
   three items.

     (1) Collecting information to design network

         Providers and their customers MAY need to verify high-level 
         service level specifications, either to continuously 
         optimize their networks, or to offer guaranteed bandwidth 
         services. Therefore, traffic accounting to monitor MPLS 
         applications is required. 

     (2) Providing a Service Level Specification

         For the purpose of optimized network design, a service 
         provider may offer the traffic informationr. Optimizing 
         network design needs this information.

     (3) Inter-AS environment

         Service providers that offer inter-AS services require 
         accounting of those services.

     These three motivations need to satisfy the following.

        - In (1) and (2), collection of information on a per-LSP 
          basis is a minimum level of granularity of collecting 
          accounting information at both of ingress and egress 
          of an LSP.

        - In (3), SP's ASBR carry out interconnection functions as an
          intermediate LSR. Therefore, identifying a pair of ingress 



MPLS Working Group             Expires June 2005            [Page 10]

Internet Draft           MPLS OAM Requirements          December 2004



          and egress LSRs using each LSP is needed to determine the 
          cost of the service that a customer is using.

    4.11.1 Requirements

     Accounting on a per-LSP basis encompasses the following set of
     functions:

      (1) At an ingress LSR accounting of traffic through LSPs
          beginning at each egress in question.

      (2) At an intermediate LSR, accounting of traffic through
          LSPs for each pair of ingress to egress.

      (3) At egress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs
          for each ingress.

      (4) All LSRs that contain LSPs that are being measuremented
          need to have a common key to distinguish each LSP.
          The key MUST be unique to each LSP, and its mapping to
          LSP SHOULD be provided from whether manual or automatic
          configuration.

       In the case of non-merged LSPs, this can be achieved by
       simply reading traffic counters for the label stack associated
       with the LSP at any LSR along its path. However, in order to  
       measure merged LSPs, an LSR MUST have a means to distinguish 
       the source of each flow so as to disambiguate the statistics. 

     4.11.2 Scalability

     It is not realistic to perform the just described operations by
     LSRs in a network on all LSPs that exist in a network.
     At a minimum, per-LSP based accounting SHOULD be performed on the
     edges of the network -- at the edges of both LSPs and the MPLS 
     domain.

5. Security Considerations

   Provisions to any of the tools designed to satisfy the requirements
   described herin are required to prevent their unauthorized use. 
   Likewise, these tools MUST provide a means by which an operator 
   can prevent denial of service attacks if those tools are used in 
   such an attack.

   LSP mis-merging has security implications beyond that of simply
   being a network defect. LSP mis-merging can happen due to a number 
   of potential sources of failure, some of which (due to MPLS label 
   stacking) are new to  MPLS.

   The performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization 
   involve extracting a significant amount of information about 
   network construction which the network operator MAY consider 
   private.

6. IANA Considerations
 
   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces
   [RFC2434].
