Abstract 
    
   CONVERT defines extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for 
   optimization in a mobile setting, aimed at allowing adaptation and 
   transcoding of attachments as needed by the client. Conversion 
   (adaptation, transcoding) may be requested by the client and 
   performed by the server on a best effort basis or decided by the 
   server based on its knowledge of the client capabilities, user or 
   administrator preferences or its settings.

1. Introduction 
    
   CONVERT is based on IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501]. It defines additional 
   enhancements for optimization in a mobile setting: extensions to the 
   IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] that allows adaptation and transcoding 
   of body parts as needed by the client. Conversion (adaptation, 
   transcoding) may be requested by the client and performed by the 
   server on a best effort basis or decided by the server based on its 
   knowledge of the client capabilities, user or administrator 
   preferences or its settings.  
    
   These are important features required in particular to support mobile 
   email use cases [MEMAIL], [OMA-ME-RD]. 
    
   A server that supports CONVERT can convert leaf body parts to other 
   formats to be viewed on a mobile device. The client can explicitly 
   request a particular conversion. The server complies on a best effort 
   basis. When not possible, the server determines based on its own 
   strategy (e.g. based on knowledge of the client as discussed 
   hereafter) how to convert. If the server knows the characteristics of 
   the device or can determine them (out of scope of CONVERT), the 
   attachments can also be optimized for the capabilities of the devices 
   (e.g. form factor of pictures). This is a recommended server 
   behavior. 
   
   
2. Relation with other E-mail specifications 
    
   The Lemonade Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] specifies the Lemonade Pull 
   Model that governs the exchanges among mail servers or between 
   desktop mail client and mail servers. Lemonade investigates adding 
   mobile optimizations for the next version of the profile.

                              <CONVERT>                      May 2006 
 
 
    
   CONVERT should be seen as a way to address the issues of mobile 
   optimization and an input to the Lemonade Profile work. It addresses 
   the topic of attachment conversions identified by the Lemonade work 
   as critical for mobile email.  
    
   CONVERT does not address conversion and streaming of media as also 
   identified of interest by lemonade. This has not been identified as 
   relevant to mobile e-mail [MEMAIL] and [OMA-ME-RD]. 
    
   CONVERT depends on the ANNOTATEMORE extension [ANNOTATEMORE] to 
   support discover of supported conversion formats. In addition, to use 
   CONVERT, the client and server MUST support the IMAP Binary 
   specification [RFC3516]. 
    
   
 
3. Interactions between the Client and Server when supporting CONVERT 
    
   This document does not specify how conversions are to be done by the 
   server. It is however noted that the conversion MUST NOT affect the 
   document stored in the message storage server in order to remain 
   accessible unaffected through other clients that do not request 
   conversion as well as in order to allow replies or forward of the 
   documents as they were originally received by the server. 
   
 
4. Discovery with the CAPABILITY and GETANNOTATION Commands 
 

4.1. CAPABILITY 
    
   A server that supports CONVERT MUST return "CONVERT", "ANNOTATEMORE", 
   and "BINARY" and in the CAPABILITY response. 
     
    
   Example: A server that implements LDELIVER.  
      C: a001 CAPABILITY 
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=LOGIN IDLE CONVERT BINARY 
   ANNOTATEMORE 
      S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed 
    
 

4.2. GETANNOTATION 
    
   To determine which conversions are supported, mailbox annotations are 
   used. For each mime-type that the client is interested in, it MAY 
   determine which conversions are supported. For any proposed 
   conversion, the client MAY discover a list of optional parameters 
   that the conversion SHOULD accept. MIME type/subtype are mapped to a 
   hierarchy under the root “/convert”. For each mime type under

                              <CONVERT>                      May 2006 
 
 
   “/convert”, a value for “types.shared” SHOULD exist which is a 
   semicolon separated list of output formats. 
    
   Example: Discover all image conversions 
    
      C: a GETANNOTATION "INBOX" "/convert/image/*" "types.shared" 
      S: * ANNOTATION "INBOX" "/convert/image/jpeg"  
            ("types.shared” "image/jpeg;image/png;image/gif;image/wbmp”) 
      S: a OK GETANNOTATION complete 
    
   The above example shows that the server supports one kind of input 
   image transcoding, from image/jpeg to four different outputs: JPEG, 
   PNG, GIF, and WBMP. 
    
   For a given conversion, optional transcoding parameters MAY be 
   present. These are mapped into a value “params.shared” under 
   “/convert/sourcetype/destinationtype”. 
    
      Example: Discover optional parameters for image/jpeg -> image/gif. 
    
      C: a GETANNOTATION "INBOX" "/convert/image/jpeg/image/gif" 
   "params.shared" 
      S: * ANNOTATION "INBOX" "/convert/image/jpeg/image/gif"  
            ("params.shared” "width;height;depth;interlaced”) 
      S: a OK GETANNOTATION complete 
    
   The above example shows that to convert from image/jpeg to image/gif, 
   the transcoding supports the following types of option parameters: 
   width, height, depth, and interlaced. 
    
   A client MAY use these values to check whether or not a desired 
   conversion is possible, or it may present the parameters as a GUI 
   preferences pane for the user to customize. A baseline set of 
   register transcoding parameter names should be standardized (see 
   [OMA-STI]) in the future, and it is beyond the scope of this spec to 
   allow the client to discover the underlying legal values that these 
   parameters may take. 
    
   
 
5. CONVERT BODY and BINARY data item extension 
    
   CONVERT is a FETCH extension used to transcode the media type of a 
   leaf MIME part into another media type, and/or the same media type, 
   with different encoding parameters. It adds new options to the 
   section-spec part of the BODY data item, a new FETCH response data 
   item BODYPARTSTRUCTURE, and new response codes. It is also expected 
   to work with IMAP BINARY data item extension, whose grammar is 
   modified as well. The response to a CONVERT request always includes a 
   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE.

                              <CONVERT>                      May 2006 
 
 
    
   CONVERT’s syntax is modeled after the HEADER.FIELDS syntax in 
   RFC3501, and is generally structured as: 
    
   BODY[section-part.CONVERT[.STRICT] (“media type/subtype” 
   (parameters))] 
    
   BODY.PEEK[section-part.CONVERT[.STRICT] (“media type/subtype” 
   (parameters))]<partial> 
    
   BINARY[section-part.CONVERT[.STRICT]  (“media type/subtype” 
   (parameters))]<partial> 
    
   BINARY.PEEK[section-part.CONVERT[.STRICT]  (“media type/subtype” 
   (parameters))]<partial> 
    
   BINARY.SIZE[section-part.CONVERT[.STRICT]  (“media type/subtype” 
   (parameters))]<partial> 
 
   Example:  The client fetches body part section 3 in the message with 
   the message sequence number of 2 and asks to have that attachment 
   converted to pdf format.   
    
      C: a001 FETCH 2 BODY[3.CONVERT (“APPLICATION/PDF”)] 
      S: * 2 FETCH (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("APPLICATION" "PDF" () NIL  
         NIL "Base64" 2135 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3] {2135} 
         <the document in .pdf format> 
         ) 
      S: a001 OK FETCH COMPLETED 
 
   Example:  The client requests for conversion of a text/html section 
   as text/plain and asks for a charset of us-ascii.  The server cannot 
   respect the charset request because there are non-us-ascii characters 
   in the html code.  Thus, in the untagged response, the server returns 
   the charset of UTF-8 and utilizes a content transfer encoding capable 
   of representing the full 8-bit range, along with the converted text. 
    
      C: a001 FETCH 2 BODY[3.CONVERT (“text/plain” (“charset” “us-
   ascii”))] 
      S: * 2 FETCH (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("charset" 
   "utf-8") NIL  
         NIL "Base64" 2135 181 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3] {2135} 
           the document in text/plain format with utf-8 character set 
           ) 
      S: a001 OK FETCH COMPLETED

                              <CONVERT>                      May 2006 
 
 
 
   Example:  The client requests for conversion of a text/html section 
   as text/plain, but only wants 1000 bytes, starting from byte 2001.  
      C: a001 FETCH 2 BODY[3.CONVERT (“TEXT/PLAIN” (“CHARSET” “us-
   ascii”))]<2001.1000>  
      S: * 2 FETCH (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("charset" "us-
   ascii") NIL  
         NIL "7bit" 2135 181 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3]<2001> {135} 
           bytes 2001 - 2135 of the document in text/plain format 
           ) 
      S: a001 OK FETCH COMPLETED 
    
   The server is not required to respect a particular transcoding 
   request or its request parameters unless the STRICT qualifier is 
   used, although it MAY try to make a best effort to fulfill that 
   request if it is omitted. Indeed, the server may know a priori 
   information about the client obtained through a different mechanism 
   outside the scope of CONVERT (e.g. dynamically through device 
   description mechanisms or when the device was associated to the 
   account). These preferences may be used to predefine what conversions 
   are possible. Ideally the client should request the same conversions. 
   In addition, this information may also allow attachment adaptation 
   (e.g. picture form factor) instead of solely format conversion. 
   
 
6. CONVERT transcoding parameters 
    
   CONVERT servers MAY support additional transcoding parameters for 
   each media type. All CONVERT compliant servers MUST minally support 
   recognition of charset for text/* mime types, although they may 
   decline to honor some requests. For media types other than text, it 
   is beyond the scope of this document to define conversion parameters. 
   In general however, CONVERT compliant servers MAY choose to support 
   additional parameters, and if so, they SHOULD follow the OMA STI 1.0 
   spec [OMA-STI] adopting the same parameter names as defined in 
   section 5.2.4 and above for the most popular image/*, video/*, and 
   audio/* codecs 
    
   As an example, in section 5.2.6.2 of [OMA-STI], the parameters 
   "width" and "height" are defined. The following example illustrates 
   how these OMA STI parameters are used with CONVERT. 
    
         C: a001 UID FETCH 100 BINARY[2.CONVERT (“IMAGE” “JPG” (“WIDTH” 
   “128” “HEIGHT” “96”))]  
         S: * 2 FETCH (UID 100 BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[2] ("IMAGE" "JPG"   
            () NIL NIL "8bit » 4182 NIL NIL NIL) BINARY[2] ~{4182}   
            <this part of a document is a rescaled image in JPG format 
   with width=128, height=96.>  
            )  
         S: a001 OK UID FETCH COMPLETED

6.1. Mandatory Transcoding support 
    
   A server implementing CONVERT MUST support character set conversions 
   for the text/plain mime type, and MUST support character set 
   conversions from iso-8859-* to utf-8. 
    
   A client requesting the mailbox annotation “/convert/text/plain” MUST 
   return “text/plain” as an allowed destination conversion. And a 
   request for annotation “/convert/text/plain/text/plain” must return 
   “charset” as a supported transcoding parameter. 
    
   Servers SHOULD offer additional character encoding conversions where 
   they make sense as libraries of conversion facilities are generally 
   available on many platforms. 
    
   If for some reason, the server cannot carry about the trancoding 
   without preserving all the characters, the server should add an 
   INFORMATIONLOSS response code to the response, unless STRICT is 
   request, in which case it may return a BADPARAMETERS response code. 
    
6.1.1. Additional informative recommendations for mobile usage 
    
   As additional guidance to developers, based on the expected usage of 
   convert in mobile environments, it is recommended that: 
    
   - Servers SHOULD support conversion of HTML and XHTML documents to 
     text in ways that preserve at the minimum the document structure 
     and tables. 
   - Server SHOULD support image conversions among the types image/gif, 
     image/jpeg and image/png for at least the parameters: 
        o Size limit (i.e. reduce quality),  
        o width,  
        o height,  
        o resize directive (crop, stretch, aspect ratio) 
      depth may also be of interest. 
    
   It is also recognized that audio conversion is of significant 
   interest but the relevant formats depend significantly on the usage 
   context. 
    
   Support of other formats like proprietary document formats and video 
   can also be described as MIME types and STI parameters. Their support 
   depends on the usage context.

7. FETCH response extensions 
    
   The BODYPARTSTRUCTURE data item is introduced when using the CONVERT 
   extension.  It follows the exact syntax specified in the [RFC3501] 
   BODYSTRUCTURE data item, but contains information for only the 
   converted part.  All information contained in BODYPARTSTRUCTURE 
   pertains to the state of the part after it is converted, such as the 
   converted mime-type, sub-type, size, or charset.  The client must 
   respect the return values and not assume the conversion request 
   succeeds exactly as requested unless the STRICT qualifier is used. 
   
 
8. Status responses, Response code extensions 
    
   Some transcodings may require parameters. If a transcoding request is 
   sent for a format which requires parameters, the server can reply 
   with a BAD response. Likewise, malformed mime types may also generate 
   BAD responses.  
    
   If the server if unable to perform the requested conversion because a 
   resource is unavailable (internal error, transcoding service down) 
   than a BAD response should be returned. 
    
   If a request is denied because of an operational error, such as lack 
   of disk space, or because the requested conversion for some reason 
   cannot be performed, and there is no fallback for this particular 
   device (such as the case where a proprietary document format has no 
   existing transcoding implementation, and the server recognizes that 
   the client has no default viewer for it), the server SHOULD return a 
   NO response. 
    
   Otherwise, the server should return an OK response. The client in 
   general can tell from the BODYPARTSTRUCTURE response whether or not 
   its request was honored exactly, but may not know exactly why it 
   differents. 
    
   The following extension response codes are provided for OK and NO 
   responses to disambiguate those situations, or warn about possible 
   important data loss. 
    
   INFORMATIONLOSS – the conversion was satisfied for conversion 
   request, but it may have resulted in the loss of important data 
   (primarily of use for loss of text data, since richmedia is often 
   compressed with loss)   
    
   BADPARAMETERS “(“ convert-params “)” – the listed parameters were not 
   understood, or could not be honored for the reasons noted in section-
   text. In particular, a CONVERT.STRICT request may be fail because the 
   server has no way to honor it.

   SERVEROVERRIDE – the server override the request because it 
   determined it could substitute a better one based on preferences, 
   device capability knowledge, or server policy. If CONVERT.STRICT is 
   used, the server may not return SERVEROVERRIDE. It must either honor 
   the request, or fail. 
   
 
9. Formal Syntax 
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (ABNF) notation as used in [ABNF], and incorporates by reference 
   the Core Rules defined in that document. 
    
   This syntax augments the grammar specified in [RFC3501] and 
   [RFC3516].

   In addition, the following ABNF describes the syntax of the 
   GETANNOTATION entries in Section 4.2 
    
         convert-entry-req = available-conversions / available-
   transcoding-parameters 
     
         available-conversions = “/convert/” from-mime-type 
     
         from-mime-type = “*” /(astring [“/” (astring / “*”)] 
                          ; i.e. “*” or “type/*” or “type/subtype” 
    
         from-concrete-mime-type = astring “/” astring  
                          ; i.e.  “type/subtype” 
    
         to-mime-type = astring “/” astring 
    
         available-transcoding-parameters = “/convert/” from-concrete-
   mime-type “/” to-mime-type 
                        ;i.e. 
   /convert/fromtype/fromsubtype/totype/tosubtype 
    
    
   Finally, two standard annotation attributes are defined. Under 
   available-conversions entry, there will be an attribute named 
   “types.shared” with the following ABNF: 
    
         types-shared-value = from-concrete-mime-type(“;” from-concrete-
   mime-type)* 
    
   And under an available-transcoding-parameters entry, there will be an 
   attribute named “params.shared” with the following ABNF: 
    
         params-shared-value = transcoding-param-name (“;” transcoding-
   param-name)* 
    

10. Compression 
    
   This section describes how CONVERT can allow compression of text and 
   binary literals. 
    
   While it could be argued that transport could provide generic 
   compression of the data (e.g. TLS with NULL Cipher), application 
   level compression presents the advantage to be better tunable to the 
   type of data being requested, for example, to avoid compression of 
   already compressed data. 
    
   Compression performances depend on the actual types of e-mail that 
   are received. They change between text bodies and different types of

   attachments.  In general, the present approach presents a worthwhile 
   gain over uncompressed or network compressed only approached at very 
   little extra cost for the implementer. 
    
   Bandwidth optimizations are important features required in particular 
   to support mobile email use cases ([MEMAIL], [OMA-ME-RD]). 
    

10.1. Capability description 
    
   The server capability to support compression is handled as any other 
   conversion capability via the transcoding parameter name 
   'compression' and its associated value 'deflate'. 
    

10.2. Compression requests 
    
   When compression is requested through the compression transcoding 
   parameter name and value 'deflate' added to any conversion request.  
    
   The items to compress are processed via the DEFLATE algorithm, after 
   any other requested conversion (except encryption) are applied on 
   that element.  
    

10.3. Responses 
    
   Responses from the server and its behavior of the server follow the 
   responses and behavior of other CONVERT requests. However, the 
   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE response MUST include an extra body-fld-param named 
   "compression" with value "deflate" 
    

11. Object Level Encryption 
    
   In the presence of proxy and other intermediaries, it is of interest 
   to allow object level encryption of the emails. This also allows 
   simplifying the securing the deployment models across multiple 
   domains considered by OMA. 
    

11.1. Capability description 
    
   The server capability to support compression is handled as any other 
   conversion capability via the transcoding parameter name 'encryption' 
   and its associated value encryption-identifier, where the encryption 
   identifier refers to the selected algorithms and keys to be used.  
    
   Associating algorithms and selecting keys are at this stage taking 
   place of out of band of the CONVERT exchanges.

11.2. Object level encryption requests 
    
   When encryption is requested through the 'encryption' transcoding 
   parameter name and value encryption-descriptor added to any 
   conversion request.  
    
   The items to encrypt are processed via the encryption algorithm, 
   after any other requested conversion applied on that element. 
    
   Encryption requests SHOULD use CONVERT.STRICT requests.  
    
   Encryption identifiers at the moment are not defined, pending future 
   work. One possibility is to use S/MIME or OpenPGP as a mechanism, 
   with "smime" or "openpgp" as an identifier that has the effect of 
   causing a transcoded body part to be additionally converted and 
   encapsulated in an encrypted part. Although, with OpenPGP there may 
   be issues with converting a leaf part node into a multipart/encrypted 
   node. This are requires more study. 
     
    

11.3. Responses 
    
   The responses from the server and its behavior follow the responses 
   and behavior of other CONVERT requests  
    
   However, if a request to encrypt can not be satisfied, it MUST always 
   result in an error with BADPARAMETERS. 
    
   Encryption requests may end up setting the content type to an 
   encapsulation type rather than the destination conversion type (e.g. 
   image/gif -> application/pkcs7-mime). BODYPARTSTRUCTURE might not 
   convey the properties of the encapsulated content type, but only of 
   the encapsulated encryption wrapper. This may pose a problem for 
   clients requesting non-strict conversions which base decisions on the 
   returned BODYPARTSTRUCTURE information, which may represent a 
   different conversion than the one they requested. The server MAY warn 
   clients using INFORMATIONLOSS or SERVEROVERRIDE if this occurs, but 
   clients should be defensive and not assume their request succeeded. 
    
 
 
Security Considerations 
    
   It is to be noted that some conversions may present security 
   threatens (e.g. converting a document to a damaging executable). 
   Clients should be careful when requesting conversions or processing 
   transformed attachments. Servers should avoid dangerous conversions 
   if possible. It may of interest to consider, when possible, server-

   side verification of the converted attachments before providing to 
   the server. 
    
   When an implementation is proxy-based, this may create new security 
   issues.  These issues are discussed in detail in Appendix C, because 
   the issues are dependent on the implementation of this protocol 
   rather than inherent to the protocol itself. 
 
   On bandwidth limited mobile networks where users pay per data 
   volumes, spam may become an important issue. It can be mitigated with 
   appropriate filters and server-side spam prevention tools. These are 
   of course outside the scope of CONVERT. 
 
   It is also recommended that clients be explicitly registered with the 
   server through separate channels / application. Exchanges should then 
   be paired. 
    
   Deployments that require object level encryption may present security 
   challenges to be carefully considered. Mechanisms for selecting 
   encryption algorithms and exchanging keys must be carefully 
   considered. They are currently considered as taking place out of band 
   of the CONVERT exchanges.

A. Security Issues for Proxy-Based Implementations  
    
   In some implementations, the client may connect to a proxy that sits 
   in an operator network, but the backend email storage server sits in 
   a separate enterprise network.  The enterprise network is assumed to 
   be secure, but the operator network may not be trusted.  If 
   unencrypted information lies in the operator network, that 
   information is vulnerable to attacks. 
    
   If the CONVERT extensions are all implemented in the enterprise 
   network, then the proxy on the carrier should be an encrypted SSL 
   pass-through proxy.  SSL ensures confidentiality and integrity of the 
   proxied datastream, ensuring that the proxy cannot monitor the 
   content of messages, nor inject commands to modify or corrupt the  
   enterprise email server to corrupt the user's mailbox.  The 
   additional cost for this design is that the backend enterprise email 
   server and the client devices must have additional processing to 
   handle the overhead of SSL. 
    
   If the CONVERT compliant server is implemented as a backend IMAP 
   server with additional command processing done on the proxy, there 
   are more complex security issues.  This proxy must be able to send 
   commands to the backend server to accomplish its tasks, as well as 
   read information coming from the backend server.  An attacker who 
   compromises the proxy thus can send commands to the backend to change 
   the state of the mail storage, possibly corrupting it.  In addition, 
   it can read responses from the mail server that might contain 
   confidential email information.  This proxy may also send bogus 
   responses back to the client.  Clearly, this setup is not an ideal 
   issue and many complications that make this problem complex to solve.  
   The suggestion recommended is to remedy the problem of unencrypted, 
   untagged FETCH responses that may contain confidential information.  
   Encrypted responses should be used in place of any untagged FETCH 
   responses, which contain encrypted message information to be passed 
   through the proxy on the operator network.  The key exchange for

   encryption should not occur through the proxy.  It has to be done 
   through another channel: manually entered by user (e.g. password), or 
   via an HTTP SSL request to the enterprise server.  Any other 
   additional server responses containing sensitive information 
   (passwords, etc.) should be encrypted.   
    
   It is beyond the scope of this document to define the implementation 
   of transcoding services. In general, it is recommended that they 
   reside within the same domain as the IMAP server, and are not 
   performed by third party services, which may compromise the privacy 
   of the data being transcoded. 
    
Future Work 
    
   -Details compression in CONVERT request 
   -Details options to introduce additional compression methods. 
   -Detail encryption in CONVERT request

   keys 
   -Detail any BODYPARTSTRUCTURE response parameters (body-fld-param) to 
   be added for encapsulated content types to identity the content-type 
   and other parameters of the encrypted content 
   -Collaboration with security area to validate algorithm and 
   mechanisms for encryption).
