                  Preferred Path Routing (PPR) in OSPF
           draft-chunduri-lsr-ospf-preferred-path-routing-04

Abstract

   This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR), a routing
   protocol mechanism to simplify the path description of data plane
   traffic in Segment Routing (SR) deployments with OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
   protocols.  PPR aims to mitigate the MTU and data plane processing
   issues that may result from SR packet overheads; and also supports
   further extensions along the paths.  Preferred path routing is
   achieved through the addition of path descriptions to the OSPF
   advertised prefixes, and mapping those to a PPR data-plane
   identifier.

Internet-Draft    Preferred Path Routing (PPR) in OSPF        March 2020


1.  Introduction

   In a network implementing Segment Routing (SR), packets are steered
   through the network using Segment Identifiers (SIDs) carried in the
   packet header.  Each SID uniquely identifies a segment as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].  SR capabilities are defined for
   MPLS and IPv6 data planes called SR-MPLS and SRv6 respectively.

   In SR-MPLS, a segment is encoded as a label and an ordered list of
   segments is encoded as a stack of labels on the data packet.  In
   SRv6, a segment is encoded as an IPv6 address, with in a new type of
   IPv6 hop-by-hop routing header/extension header (EH) called SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header], where an ordered list of IPv6
   addresses/segments is encoded in SRH.

   Preferred path routing cab be described as a) enabling route
   computation based on the specific path described along with the
   prefix as opposed to shortest path towards the prefix and b)
   forwarding based on the abstracted path identifier as opposed to the
   individual segments on the packet.  This also further described in
   Section 2 of [I-D.chunduri-lsr-isis-preferred-path-routing].

   Any prefix advertised with a path description from any node in the
   network is called PPR.  A PPR could be an SR path, an explicitly
   provisioned Fast Re-Route (FRR) path or a service chained path.  A
   PPR can be signaled by any node, which receives the SR path computed
   by a central controller, or by statically configuring the same on a
   node in the network.

   The issues caused by the large SID depth, and existing methods for
   mitigation are introduced in
   [I-D.chunduri-lsr-isis-preferred-path-routing] in Appendix A.1 and
   A.2.  To mitigate these issues and also to facilitate forwarding
   plane extensibility, this draft proposes a new OSPFv2 PPR TLV
   (Section 2), OSPFv3 PPR TLV (Section 3) to use the path with a
   corresponding data plane identifier.

2.  OSPFv2 PPR TLV

   Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs defined in [RFC7684] are used for
   advertisements of PPRs.  This section describes the encoding of PPR
   TLV.  This TLV can be seen as having 4 logical section viz., encoding
   of the OSPFv2 Prefix, encoding of PPR-ID, encoding of path
   description with an ordered PDE Sub-TLVs and a set of optional PPR
   attribute Sub-TLVs, which can be used to describe one or more
   parameters of the path.  Multiple OSPF PPR TLVs MAY be advertised in
   each OSPF Extended Prefix Opaque LSA, but all TLVs included in a
   single OSPF Extended Prefix Opaque LSA MUST have the same flooding
   scope.

   The PPR TLV has Type TBD (suggested value xxx), and has the following
   format:

2.1.  PPR-Flags

   Flags: 2 octet field of PPR TLV has following flags defined:

           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7                      15

           +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   w=Where:

      IA-Flag: Inter-Area flag.  If set, advertisement is of inter-area
      type.  An Area Boarder Router (ABR) that is advertising the OSPF
      PPR TLV between areas MUST set this bit.

      A: The originator of the PPR TLV MUST set the A bit in order to
      signal that the prefixes and PPR-IDs advertised in the PPR TLV are
      directly connected to the originators.  If this bit is not set,
      this allows any other node in the network advertise this TLV on
      behalf of the originating node of the "OSPF Prefix".  If PPR TLV
      is propagated to other areas the A-flag MUST be cleared.  In case
      if the originating node of the prefix has to be disambiguated for
      any reason including, if it is a Multi Homed Prefix (MHP) or
      propagated to a different OSPF area, then PPR-Attribute Sub-TLV
      Source Router ID SHOULD be included.

      Reserved: Reserved bits for future use.  Reserved bits MUST be
      reset on transmission and ignored on receive.

   PPR path description for each OSPF area is computed and given to one
   of the nodes in that area for dissemination.  Similarly path
   information when crossing the area boundaries MUST be relevant to the
   destination area.  If there is no path information available for the
   destination area, PPR TLV MUST NOT be leaked regardless of the IA bit
   status.

2.2.  PPR-Prefix Sub-TLV

   The structure of PPR-Prefix, for which path description is attached
   to is as follows:

      Sub-TLV registry.

   o  Length - Total length of the value field in bytes (variable).

   o  MT-ID - Multi-Topology ID (as defined in [RFC4915]).

   o  Prefix Len - contains the length of the OSPF prefix being encoded
      in bytes.

   o  Mask Length - The length of the prefix in bits.  Only the most
      significant octets of the Prefix are encoded.

   o  OSPFv2 Prefix - represents the OSPFv2 prefix at the tail-end of
      the advertised PPR.  For the address family IPv4 unicast, the
      prefix itself is encoded as a 32-bit value.  The default route is
      represented by a prefix of length 0.

   o  PPR-Prefix Sub-TLVs have2 octet type, 2 octet length and value
      field is defined per type.

2.3.  PPR-ID Sub-TLV

   This represents the actual data plane identifier in the packet and
   could be of any data plane as defined in PPR-ID-type field.  Both
   OSPF Prefix and PPR-ID MUST belong to a same node in the network.

   o  PPR-ID Mask Len - It is applicable for only for PPR-ID Type 2.
      For Type 1 this value MUST be set to zero.  It contains the length
      of the PPR-ID Prefix in bits.  Only the most significant octets of
      the Prefix are encoded.  This is needed, if PPR-ID followed is an
      IPv4 Prefix instead of 4 octet Address respectively.

   o  Algo - 1 octet value represents the SPF algorithm.  Algorithm
      registry is as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].

   o  PPR-ID - This is the Preferred Path forwarding identifier that
      would be on the data packet.  The value of this field is variable
      and it depends on the PPR-ID Type - for Type 1, this is encoded as
      SR-MPLS SID/Label.  For Type 2 this is a 4 byte IPv4 address
      encoded similar to PPR-Prefix.

2.4.  PPR-PDE Sub-TLV

   This is a new Sub-TLV type in PPR TLV Section 2 and is called as PPR
   Path Description Element (PDE).  PPR-PDEs are used to describe the
   path in the form of set of contiguous and ordered Sub-TLVs, where
   first Sub-TLV represents (the top of the stack in MPLS data plane or)
   first node/segment of the path.  These set of ordered Sub-TLVs can
   have both topological SIDs and non-topological SIDs (e.g., service
   segments).

      IA-Flag: Inter-Area flag.  If set, advertisement is of inter-area
      type.  An ABR that is advertising the OSPF PPR TLV between areas
      MUST set this bit.
      [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-segment-routing-extensions]

      A: The originator of the PPR TLV MUST set the A bit in order to
      signal that the prefixes and PPR-IDs advertised in the PPR TLV are
      directly connected to the originators.  If this bit is not set,
      this allows any other node in the network advertise this TLV on
      behalf of the originating node of the "OSPF Prefix".  If PPR TLV
      is propagated to other areas the A-flag MUST be cleared.  In case
      if the originating node of the prefix has to be disambiguated for
      any reason including, if it is a Multi Homed Prefix (MHP) or
      propagated to a different OSPF area, then PPR-Attribute Sub-TLV
      Source Router ID SHOULD be included.

      Reserved - reserved bits for future use.  Reserved bits MUST be
      reset on transmission and ignored on receive.

   PPR path description for each OSPF area is computed and given to one
   of the nodes in that area for dissemination.  Similarly path
   information when crossing the area boundaries MUST be relevant to the
   destination area.  If there is no path information available for the
   destination area, PPR TLV MUST NOT be leaked regardless of the IA bit
   status.

      significant octets of the Prefix are encoded.

   o  OSPFv3 Prefix - represents the OSPFv3 prefix at the tail-end of
      the advertised PPR.  For the address family IPv4 unicast, the
      prefix itself is encoded as a 32-bit value.  The default route is
      represented by a prefix of length 0.  For the address family (AF
      in OSPFv3 PPR TLV) in IPv6 unicast, the prefix, encoded as an even
      multiple of 32-bit words, padded with zeroed bits as necessary.
      This encoding consumes ((PrefixLength + 31) / 32) 32-bit words.

   o  PPR-Prefix Sub-TLVs have2 octet type, 2 octet length and value
      field is defined per type.

3.2.  OSPFv3 PPR-ID Sub-TLVs

   This represents the actual data plane identifier in the packet and
   could be of any data plane as defined in PPR-ID-type field.  Both
   OSPF Prefix and PPR-ID MUST belong to a same node in the network.

   o  PPR-ID Mask Len - It is applicable for only for PPR-ID Type 2, 3
      and 4.  For Type 1 this value MUST be set to zero.  It contains
      the length of the PPR-ID Prefix in bits.  Only the most
      significant octets of the Prefix are encoded.  This is needed, if
      PPR-ID followed is an IPv4/IPv6 Prefix instead of 4/16 octet
      Address respectively.

   o  Algo - 1 octet value represents the SPF algorithm.  Algorithm
      registry is as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-segment-routing-extensions].

   o  PPR-ID - This is the Preferred Path forwarding identifier that
      would be on the data packet.  The value of this field is variable
      and it depends on the PPR-ID Type - for Type 1, this is encoded as
      SR-MPLS SID/Label.  For Type 2 this is encoded as 4 byte IPv4
      address.  For Type 3 this is encoded as 16 byte IPv6 address.  For
      Type 2 and Type 3 encoding is similar to OSPF Prefix as specified
      in Section 2.2.  For Type 4, this is encoded as 16 byte IPv6 SID.

3.3.  OSPFv3 PPR-PDE Sub-TLV

   This is a new Sub-TLV type in PPR TLV Section 3 and is called as PPR
   Path Description Element (PDE).  PPR-PDEs are used to describe the
   path in the form of set of contiguous and ordered Sub-TLVs, where
   first Sub-TLV represents (the top of the stack in MPLS data plane or)
   first node/segment of the path.  These set of ordered Sub-TLVs can

        Type 10: SRv6 Node SID as defined in
        [I-D.li-ospf-ospfv3-srv6-extensions].  PDE-ID Len and PDE-ID
        Value are as defined in SRv6 SID.

        Type 11: SRv6 Adjacency-SID.  PDE-ID Len and PDE-ID Value are as
        defined in Type 6.

   o  PDE-ID Len - 1 Octet.  Length of PDE-ID field.

   o  Reserved - 1 Octet reserved bits for future use.  Reserved bits
      MUST be reset on transmission and ignored on receive.

   o  PPR-PDE Flags - 2 Octet flags for this TLV are described below:

        PPR-PDE Flags Format

          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7...          15
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |L|D|E|   Reserved              |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


        L: Loose Bit. This bit indicates the type of next "Topological
        PDE-ID" in the path description and overrides the L bit in
        Section 3.2.  If set, the next PDE is Loose.  If this flag is
        unset, the next Topological PDE is Strict Type.

        D: Destination Bit. By default this bit MUST be unset.  This bit
        MUST be set only for PPR-PDE Type is Topological and this PDE
        represents the PDE-ID corresponding to the PPR-Prefix
        Section 3.1.

        E: Egress Bit. By default this bit MUST be unset.  This bit MUST
        be set only for PPR-PDE Type is 2 i.e., Non-Topological and the
        service needs to be applied on the egress side of the
        topological PDE preceding this PDE.

        Reserved - Reserved bits for future use.  Reserved bits MUST be
        reset on transmission and ignored on receive.

   o  PPR-PDE Sub-TLVs have 2 octet type, 2 octet length and value field
      is defined per type.

   o  PPR-PDE Sub-TLV: Type 4 (IANA TBD), Length Total length of value
      field in bytes, Value: The Router ID of the neighbor for which the
      LAN interface is advertised.  This Sub-TLV MUST NOT be present, if
      the PPR-PDE Type is not equal to 1 i.e., Topological PDE and PDE-
      ID Type 6/9.

3.4.  OSPFv3 PPR-Attributes Sub-TLV

   PPR-Attribute Sub-TLVs describe the attributes of the path.  The
   following Sub-TLVs draw from a new registry for Sub-TLV numbers; this
   registry is to be created by IANA, and administered using the first
   come first serve process:

   o  Type 1 (suggested value, IANA TBD): PPR-Metric Sub-TLV.  Length 4
      bytes, and Value is metric of this path represented through the
      PPR-ID.  Different nodes can advertise the same PPR-ID for the
      same Prefix with a different set of PPR-PDE Sub-TLVs and the
      receiving node MUST consider the lowest metric value.

4.  Other Considerations

   Please refer to [I-D.chunduri-isis-preferred-path-routing] section 4,
   5, 6 and 7.

   Thanks to Richard Li, Alex Clemm, Padma Pillay-Esnault, Toerless
   Eckert, Kiran Makhijani and Lin Han for initial discussions on this
   topic.  Thanks to Kevin Smith and Stephen Johnson for various
   deployment scenarios applicability from ETSI WGs perspective.
   Authors also acknowledge Alexander Vainshtein for detailed
   discussions and suggestions on this topic.

   Earlier versions of draft-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions have a
   mechanism to advertise EROs through Binding SID.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following new TLV in IANA OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3 TLV code-point registry as specified in Section 2 Section 3
   respectively .

        TLV #   Name
        -----   --------------
        TBD     PPR TLV


   This document also requests IANA to create new registries for PPR TLV
   Flags field, PPR Flags, and PPR Sub-TLVs in PPR TLV as described in
   Section 2 and Section 3.

7.  Security Considerations

   Existing security extensions as described in [RFC2328] and [RFC7684]
   apply to the extensions specified in this document.  While OSPF is
   under a single administrative domain, there can be deployments where
   potential attackers have access to one or more networks in the OSPF
   routing domain.  In these deployments, stronger authentication
   mechanisms such as those specified in [RFC7474] SHOULD be used.

   Advertisement of the additional information defined in this document
   introduces no new security concerns in OSPF protocol.  However as
   this extension is related to SR-MPLS and SRH data planes as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing], those particular data plane
   security considerations does apply here.
