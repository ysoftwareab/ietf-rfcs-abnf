                draft-spaghetti-sidrops-rpki-vrp-yang-00

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG model for a commonly used
   datastructure for RPKI Validated ROA Payload data.  This specific
   datastructure is commonly used in the transport between RPKI Cache
   Validators and BGP routers.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a base YANG [RFC6020] data module to structure
   RPKI [RFC6480], Validated ROA Prefix [RFC6811] (VRP) information.
   Such export functionality has emerged in several implementations of
   relaying party (RP) software, but was not previously standardized,
   resulting in loose coordination between implementers.  This module
   establishes a simple and consistent interface for information export
   by RPs drawing from best practices observed in existing
   implementations.

2.  Export Model Design and Structure

   This section should explain why the specific elements have been
   chosen for export, and why the structure of roas block + prefix and
   AS content is the most useful or widely used.

3.  RPKI VRP Export Module

<CODE BEGINS> file "rpki-vrps.yang"
module rpki-vrp {

  namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:rpki-vrp";

  prefix rpki-vrp;
  import "ietf-inet-types" {
    prefix inet;
  }

4.  Security Considerations

   A few words about not spooking parsers would fit here.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.
