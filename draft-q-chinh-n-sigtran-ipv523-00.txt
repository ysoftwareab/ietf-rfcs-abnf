Abstract
   This document proposes the use TCP/IP as the transport protocol for 
   V5. The migration from the current trunk 2048 kbps physical to an IP
   based transport will reduce the cost associated with dedicated trunk
   based link. Also, the current signaling End-to-End will be unchanged
   to make the transition seamless as possible.

Internet-Draft     V5 Level two and three Over IP        December, 2007


1. Introduction
   This draft defines the encapsulation of V5 messages in TCP/UDP 
   packets. The concept of a physical link will be maintained, which 
   will emulate the V5 links.   

2. V5 Protocol
   The V5 protocol stack is used for the connection of an Access Network
   (AN)to a Local Exchange (LE).The AN is a system between the LE and 
   the user, replacing part or whole of the local line distribution 
   network. It is used for the following access method:
   - PSTN telephone access.
   - ISDN basic rate access.
   - ISDN primary rate access (V5.2).

   There are two forms of V5: V5.1 and V5.2. The V5.1 protocol operates
   on single E1 circuit, while the V5.2 protocol operates on a group of
   E1 circuits(up to 16 E1 lines). Both of these interfaces may utilize
   time slots 15,16,and 31 for signaling.
   Time slot zero(TS0) of the 32 time slots is always used for frame 
   alignment, error reporting and error monitoring using cyclic 
   redundancy check procedures. In the cases of V5.2 links, TS0 is 
   additionally used to verify the correct physical connection of 
   2048 kbps. 
  
2.1 Differences between V5.1 and V5.2:
   The major differences between V5.1 and V5.2 interface are:
   - The V5.1 uses only one 2048 kbit/s link, whereas V5.2 may use 
     N(N=1-16) 2048 kbits/s on one interface.
   - V5.1 does not support concentration, whereas is inherently designed
     to support it using a dedicated protocol as the Bearer Channel 
     Connection (BCC) protocol.
   - V5.1 does not support ISDN primary rate access user ports, whereas
     V5.2 does. Furthermore, the ISDN primary rate access shall be 
     applicable in semi-permanent leased line and permanent line as well
     as direct user ports.
   - V5.1 has no concept of communication channel protection, whereas 
     this function is available for V5.2 when that particular V5.2 
     interface uses more than one 2048 kbit/s. A specific protocol, 
     known as the protection protocol, is provided for this function.

2.2 Protocols
    The following protocols are defined for the various protocol layers:
   
    Layer 2:
    - LAPV5-EF
      The V5 Envelope Function sublayer exchanges information between 
      the AN and the LE.

Internet-Draft     V5 Level two and three Over IP        December, 2007


    - LAPV5-DL
      The LAPV5 Data Link sublayer defines peer-to-peer exchanges of 
      information between the AN and the LE. LAPV5-DL frames can be 
      either with or without an information filed. 

   Layer 3:
   - V5-Link Control
     The V5 Link Control Protocol is sent by the AN or the LE to convey
     information required for the coordination of the link control 
     functions for each individual 2048 kbps link.
   - V5-BCC
     The V5-BCC protocol provides the means for the LE to request the AN
     to establish and release connections between specified AN user 
     ports and specified V5 interface time slots. It enables V5 
     interface bearer channels to be allocated or de-allocated by 
     independent processes. There may be more than one process active at
     any one time for given user port.  
   - V5-PSTN
     The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)protocol defines a lot
     of useful messages for call initiation and progress in both 
     directions. This protocol sets up and clears down connections, and
     carries the information on the condition of the time that can be 
     used for necessary analogue call. The V5-PSTN protocol is used in
     conjunction with the national protocol entity in the LE. The
     national protocol entity in the LE, which is used for customer
     lines which are connected directly to the LE, is also used to
     control calls on customers lines which are connected via the
     V5-interface. The majority of the line signals are not interpreted
     by the V5-PSTN protocol, but simply transferred transparently
     between the user port in the AN and the national protocol entity
     in the LE.

   - V5-CONTROL
     Control protocol contains two parts: User Port Control and Common
     Control. The Port Control performs the blocking and unblocking 
     functions of the individual ports, when faults occur or for 
     maintenance purposes. In addition, it also supports functions that
     are specific to ISDN ports only, such as activation and 
     deactivation, fault and performance indications, and flow control 
     for signaling ISDN ports.
     The Common Control protocols is responsible for checking the 
     identity of the V5 interface, to ensure interconnection accuracy 
     and the consistency in the configuration of both sides of the 
     interface. Each side of the interface can inform or request the 
     other side of its interface ID and configuration. 
   - V5-PROTECTION
     The protection protocol is used in the case of interfaces with more
     than one 2048 kbps link. It is required the link control, the 
     control, and the BCC protocols have a communication path over the 
     V5.2 interface, even in the event 2048 kbps link failure 
     (i.e. primary or secondary link). 
     The protection protocol has the responsibility to ensure that there
     is a method by which entities in the LE and AN can communicate for
     the purpose of protecting logical C-channels in the case of a
     single link failure. In the event of protection switching being
     required for logical C-channels, it is the responsibility of the
     protection management function to initiate the switch-over in a 
     controlled manner using the protection protocol.    
     These two time slot (time slot 16 of primary and secondary link),
     are considered as Protection Group 1. The protection protocol in 
     time slot 16 of the secondary link monitors time slot 16 on both 
     the primary and secondary links. This ensures that degradation on
     the primary link is detected and that the availability of the 
     secondary link is ensured.
     
3. IP node
   The scope of IP node, in this Recommendation includes the following:
   - A link will be identified by an IP address and time slots 15,16, 31
     may be utilized for signaling
   - The link alignment procedure as the control of CRC-4 Multiframe 
   - The emergency link alignment procedure
   - The link Basic Error Rate (BER) monitor  
   - The SA7 bit control.

4. Quasi-associated Network
   A quasi-associated network between a AN (Access Network) and LE 
  (Local Network) is shown below. 

          -------------                        --------------
          |    AN     |     -------------      |     LE     |
          | V5.1,V5.2 | <-> | IP Network|  <-> | V5.1, V5.2 |
          -------------     -------------      --------------

Internet-Draft     V5 Level two and three Over IP        December, 2007


   Currently, the V5 messages of signaling traverse from AN through IP
   Network to LE using trunk E1 2048kbps. The IP network could be used 
   As a physical alternation to E1 trunk and it must be able to 
   Demonstrate at least equal reliabilities and non alternate the 
   routing capabilities.        

5. V5 Signaling and IP Connection 
   Each link will have its own IP address and processor, one link 2048 
   kbit/s for V5.1 and could be 16 links 2048 kbit/s for V5.2. This will
   maintain the current link concepts intact for reliability, 
   redundancy, alignment, load sharing, etc. V5 <-> IP <-> LE 
   interworking should be as transparent as possible. 

6. TCP encapsulation
   The current V5 (V5.1 or V5.2) is to be used as is. It transports the 
   signals of analogue telephone, the messages of ISDN (BRI for V5.1 and
   BRI, PRI for V5.2). TCP packets will be used to transport the 
   messages of level 2 and level 3 of V5.      
   - TCP encapsulation of level 2
   - TCP encapsulation of level 3
   This mechanism reduces the risk of V5-IP-V5 losing the important 
   information by eliminating the need for new protocols.
  
                -------------------------------
                |  TCP header |  V5.1 or V5.2 |
                -------------------------------     

   However the type of encapsulation scheme and how it is used can have
   an effect on the data throughput rate and so it should not be 
   ignored. A message can have two modes of encapsulation: framed and
   transparent. 
   In transparent mode all the data from an incoming signal including 
   interpacket gap and the preamble will be transported. This means that
   line-side bandwidth is being used to transport "overhead" data.
   Conversely if message is operated in framed mode, it will only 
   transport the actual frame and not the preamble or interpacket gap
   This can obviously lead to bandwidth efficiencies.

7. IPMultilink Timers
   The timers for IPMultilink have been extended as following: 

   7.1 Layer 2 ISDN protocol:
       - T200  1 s      transmission of a frame may be initiated
       - T203  10 s     the maximum time allowed without frame being
                        exchanged. 
   7.2 BCC protocol:
       - Tbcc1          500-1500 ms       ALLOCATION sent
       - Tbcc2          2 s               DE-ALLOCATION sent
       - Tbcc3          2 s               DE-ALLOCATION sent
       - Tbcc4          500 - 1500 ms     AUDIT sent
       - Tbcc5          500 - 1500  ms    AN FAULT sent

   7.3 Protection protocol:
       - TS01          1500 ms           SWITCH-OVER Com sent
       - TS02          1500 ms           OS-SWITCH-OVER sent
       - TS03          1500 ms           SWITCH-OVER REQUEST sent
       - TS04          20 s              RESET SN COM sent
       - TS05          10 s              Receipt of RESET SN COM

8. IPMultilink Procedures
   Independently the choice of encapsulation, all procedures of V5 are
   applicable.   

   8.1 IPMultilink BCC procedures:
        - bearer channel allocation: normal procedure
        - bearer channel allocation: exceptional procedure
        - bearer channel de-allocation: normal procedure
        - bearer channel de-allocation: exceptional procedure
        - audit procedure
        - AN internal failure notification procedure 
        - Handling of error conditions.
    are unchanged from the current procedures.
       
   8.2 IPMultilink Protection procedures:
       - transmission of protection messages
       - receipt of protection protocol messages
       - sequence number reset: normal procedure
       - sequence number reset : exceptional procedure
       - standard protection switch-over procedure initiated by LE-side:
         normal procedure
       - standard protection switch-over procedure initiated by LE-side:
         exceptional procedure 
    are unchanged from the current procedures.

    8.3 IPMultilink Port Alignment procedure
       The Port alignment can be carried out in two ways:
     8.3.1 Coordinated Port Alignment
       This procedure allows alignment of port states by issuing Block
       and Unblock messages for each individual port. This procedure is
       unchanged from the current procedure.
     8.3.2 Accelerated Port Alignment procedure
       This procedure allows alignment of port states without issuing 
       Block and Unblock messages for each individual port. This 
       procedure is unchanged from the current procedure.
  
9. IPMultilink CRC-4 Multiframe
   E1 framing for both V5.1 and V5.2 links should always be CRC-4 
   Multiframe. This same reliability must be used in IPMultilink. 

10. IPMultilink SA7 bit 
   This procedure allows the verification of link continuity by link
   identification. This procedure is unchanged from the current 
   procedure.
 
11. IPMultilink identification 
   The IPMultilink is identified by an IP address. The required number
   of IP address is dependent to the AN which has the V5.1 interface or
   V5.2 interface. 

12. Security Considerations
   This type of process document does not have a direct impact on the
   Security of the Internet or Internet protocols.

13. IANA Considerations
   No IANA actions are required by this document.
