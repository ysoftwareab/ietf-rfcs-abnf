Internet-Draft  SHA-0 and SHA-1 Security Considerations      Sept 2010

   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents 
   (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of 
   publication of this document. Please review these documents

1. Introduction 

   The Secure Hash Algorithms, SHA-1 and SHA-2 family (SHA) are 
   specified in [SHS]. This document also makes assertions about SHA-0, 
   which was documented in an earlier version of [SHS]. NIST withdrew 
   SHA-0 in 1996.  SHA-0 and SHA-1 are message digest algorithms that 
   take as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 
   160-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.  The 
   published attacks against both algorithms show that it is not prudent 
   to use them when collision resistance is required. 

   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols and 
   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way 
   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet 
   protocols. 

   Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in 
   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [WORDS]. 

2. SHA-0 Security Considerations 

   What follows are recent attacks against SHA-0's collision, pre-image, 
   and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally, attacks against SHA-0 
   used in message authentication with a shared secret (i.e., HMAC-SHA-
   0) are discussed. 

   It must be noted that the discussions about SHA-0 is for completeness 
   only.  NIST withdrew SHA-0 in 1996.  Any use of SHA-0 is strongly 
   discouraged.

Internet-Draft  SHA-0 and SHA-1 Security Considerations      Sept 2010 
    

2.1. Collision Resistance 

   SHA-0 was published in 1993 by NIST.  The first attacks were 
   published in 1998 [CHJO1998] and showed collisions can be found in 
   2^61 operations.  In 2006, [NSSYK2006] showed an improved attack that 
   can find collisions in 2^36 operations. 

2.2. Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance 

   Even though SHA-0 has been withdrawn, it has been studied as a weaker 
   version of SHA-1 in many research literatures. The main results 
   obtained on pre-image and second pre-image attack are on reduced 
   versions of SHA-0. [deCARE2008] showed a pre-image attack on 49 out 
   of 80 rounds of SHA-0 with a complexity of 2^159 and [AOSA2009] 
   showed a pre-image attack on 52 out of 80 rounds of SHA-0 with a 
   complexity of 2^156. These results are considered as assertions on 
   security margins of SHA-0 on pre-image resistance. 

2.3. HMAC-SHA-0 

   The attacks on HMAC presented so far can be classified in three 
   types: distinguishing attacks, existential forgery attacks, and key 
   recovery attacks. Of course, among all these attacks, key recovery 
   attacks are the most severe attacks. 

   As opposed to attacking a hash function, which can be conducted 
   through purely offline computations, an attack on HMAC would need to 
   query a large amount of HMAC values, since the keys are unknown. The 
   best results on partial key recovery attacks on HMAC-SHA0 were 
   published at ASIACRYPT 2006 with 2^84 queries and 2^60 SHA-0 
   computations [COYI2006]. 

3. SHA-1 Security Considerations 

   What follows are recent attacks against SHA-1's collision, pre-image, 
   and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally, attacks against SHA-1 
   used in message authentication with a shared secret (i.e., HMAC-SHA-
   1) are discussed. 

   It must be noted that NIST has recommended that SHA-1 not be used for 
   generating digital signatures after Dec 31st 2010 and has mandated 
   that it not be used for generating digital signatures after December 
   31st 2013 [SP800-131]. 

3.1. Collision Resistance 

   SHA-1 was published by NIST in 1995.  The first attack was published 
   in early 2005 [RIOS2005].  It described a theoretical shortcut attack 
 
Polk, et al.           Expires January 30, 2011                [Page 3] 

Internet-Draft  SHA-0 and SHA-1 Security Considerations      Sept 2010 
    

   on a version of SHA-1 reduced to 53 rounds.  The very next month 
   [WLY2005] showed collisions in the full 80 round SHA-1 in 2^69 
   operations.  Since then, many new analysis methods have been 
   developed to improve the attack presented in [WLY2005]. However, 
   there is no formal claimed complexity in finding collision for full 
   version SHA-1 in less complexity than the result presented in 
   [WLY2005]. The IACR ePrint version [Man2008/469] of [Man2009] claimed 
   that using the method presented in the paper, a collision of full 
   SHA-1 can be found in 2^51 hash function calls. However, the claimed 
   bound is removed when it was published at a conference [Man2009]. 

   In any case, the known research results indicated that SHA-1 is not 
   as collision resistant as expected. The collision security strength 
   is significantly less than an ideal hash function, and its use in 
   digital signature generation after 2010 has been deprecated by NIST. 

3.2. Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance 

   The preimage and second preimage attacks published so far on reduced 
   versions of SHA-1 just indicate the security margin of SHA-1 in 
   resistance to these attacks. [AOSA2009] showed a preimage attack on 
   48 out of 80 steps with complexity of 2^159. 

   [KeSch] discovered for a narrow pipe Merkle-Damgaard hash functions, 
   finding a second preimage takes less than 2^n computations. This 
   result applies to all the narrow pipe Merkle-Damgaard hash functions 
   and not specific for SHA-1. When n = 160 in case of SHA-1, for 60 
   byte message, it will take 2^106 computations to find a second 
   preimage. 

3.3. HMAC-SHA-1 

   So far, there is no indication that attacks and analysis results on 
   SHA-1 can be extended to HMAC-SHA-1. 

4. Guidance 

   SHA-1 no longer provides an acceptable security level when used in 
   digital signature applications.  IETF protocol designers SHOULD NOT 
   specify digital signature algorithms using SHA-1 as mandatory to 
   implement.  IETF protocols that rely on SHA-1 based digital 
   signatures MUST include countermeasures that mitigate SHA-1's reduced 
   collision resistance by randomized hashing (e.g., as specified in 
   [SP800-107]). 

   HMAC-SHA-1 remains secure and is the preferred keyed hash algorithm 
   for IETF protocol design.

   As noted above, any use of SHA-0 is strongly discouraged. Discussions 
   regarding the strength of SHA-0 were included for completeness only. 
   SHA-0 has no functional or performance advantage, and SHA-1 is 
   considered significantly more secure.
