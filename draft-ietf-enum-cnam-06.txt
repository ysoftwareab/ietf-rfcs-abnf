Internet-Draft          CNAM Enumservice              Sept 2007 
 
  This document registers the Enumservice 'pstn' and subtype 'cnam' 
  using the URI scheme 'pstn:' as per the IANA registration process 
  defined in the ENUM specification, RFC 3761[1] and registers a new 
  URI type 'pstn:' according to the URI registration procedure in RFC 
  4395 [15].   
   
  This data is used to facilitate the transfer of Calling Name Delivery 
  (CNAM) data for calls that originate on the Public Switched Telephone 
  Network (PSTN) that may be displayed on VoIP or other Real-time 
  Client User Agents (CUA). The pstn URI is created to facilitate this 
  transfer, however this URI may be used to transport other PSTN data 
  in the future.

2.   Introduction 
   

  ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping), RFC 3761 is a system that transforms 
  E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication Number 
  Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164) [2] into domain names and then uses 
  the Domain Name System (DNS), RFC 1034 [3] and Naming Authority 
  Pointer Records (NAPTR) records in the Dynamic Delegation Discovery

Internet-Draft          CNAM Enumservice              Sept 2007 
 
  System (DDDS) RFC 3403 [4]) to query the services that are available 
  for a specific domain name. 
   
  This document registers an Enumservice 'cnam' according to the 
  guidelines given in RFC 3761, to be used for provisioning a NAPTR [4] 
  resource record to indicate a type of functionality associated with 
  an end point and/or telephone number.  The registration is defined 
  within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [4][5][6][7][8]) 
  hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC 
  3761.  
   
  This document also registers an IANA URI type 'pstn' per the 
  requirements of RFC 4395. 
   
  The purpose of this Enumservice is to enable service providers to 
  place Calling Name Delivery information (CNAM) into ENUM databases or 
  to send ENUM queries to a protocol converter that would have access 
  to the Signaling System 7 (SS7) Network.  This, in turn, could enable 
  such parties to offer Calling Name Delivery services using the 
  technology provided by RFC 3761.  
   
  The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 dictate that a 'type' and 
  one or more 'subtype' should be specified.  Within this set of 
  specifications the convention is assumed that the 'type' (being the 
  more generic term) defines the service and at least one of the 
  ‘subtype’ may indicate the URI scheme. 
   
  In this document, one type is specified, 'pstn' and one subtype 
  'cnam' with the URI scheme specified, 'pstn:'. 
   
3.    Protocol Design Considerations. 

   
  The design of this protocol was influenced by several factors: 
 
  RFC 3761 has become the defacto query-response protocol of choice for 
  a variety of data types associated with E.164 numbering and 
  addressing including data not necessarily associated with a SIP [18] 
  or other communications session. RFC 3761 is already being used by 
  service providers to query for data that has significant privacy or 
  security issues associated with it. RFC 4769 [17], for instance, 
  describes an Enumservice that associates an E.164 number with a PSTN 
  Local Routing Number. An Enumservice for CNAM data has similar design 
  requirements of being used in private and closed systems. 
   
  Communications service providers are concerned with the impact of 
  call setup up times on the overall user experience. There is a strong 
  desire to maintain a single query mechanism for data involving E.164 
  phone numbers and not complicate call processing applications with 
  multiple protocol mechanisms. Were the query for CNAM data to require

Internet-Draft          CNAM Enumservice              Sept 2007 
 
  a secondary protocol mechanism such as LDAP or IRIS to retrieve the 
  data, it could significantly impact call setup times. 
   
     
4.   Definition of PSTN CNAM Data 

 
  Calling Name data is a string of up to 15 ASCII [9] characters of 
  information associated with a specific calling party number [10] [11] 
  [12] [13] [14].  In the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) this 
  data is sent by the originating network only at the specific request 
  of the terminating network via a SS7 Transaction Capabilities 
  Application Part (TCAP) response message.    
   
   
5. 
  The PSTN URI 
 
  This document proposes a new URI scheme specifically to carry PSTN 
  data in general and CNAM data specifically. 
 
  pstnuri    = "pstn:" datatype ["/" telephone-subscriber ] ";" 
                (content / reason) 
  datatype   = "cnam" 
             ; Other datatypes can be defined by adding alternative 
             ; values. 
  content    = [ mediatype ] [ ":base64" ] "," data 
  mediatype  = [ type "/" subtype ] *( ";" parameter ) 
  data       = *urlchar 
  parameter  = attribute "=" value 
  reason     = "available=" ("p" / "u") 
   
  ANSI standards specify the use of ASCII in the response to TCAP 
  queries for Calling Name data.  This specification does not preclude 
  the use of internationalized characters within the pstn URI, nor does 
  it preclude the use of more than 15 characters.  
 
5.1 Enumservice Privacy Responses and Parameters 
 
  The PSTN defines several values for CNAM data in the event that there 
  are privacy restrictions on the access to that data or that the data 
  is unavailable.  These are defined as "Reason for Absence of Name" in 
  GR-1188 [13], consequently the following responses to a query are 
  reserved. 
   
  Within the media type 'cnam' two optional parameters are supported. 
     
  Calling Name Privacy Indicator: 'unavailable=p'   
   
  This parameter defined as the Calling Name data information may be 
  available but the Calling Party does not wish to have their Calling 
  Name data displayed by Called Party User Agents.

Internet-Draft          CNAM Enumservice              Sept 2007 
 
   
  Usage: pstn:cnam;unavailable=p 
   
  Calling Name Status Indicator 
   
  Definition: 'unavaiable=u' 
   
  This parameter is defined as there is no Calling Name data for that 
  E.164 number available. 
   
  Usage: pstn:cnam;unavailable=u 
   
 
6.   Distribution of CNAM Data 

   
  The distribution of CNAM data is often highly restricted.The NAPTR 
  records described herein should not be part of the e164.arpa DNS 
  tree.  Distribution of this NAPTR data would be either within a 
  service provider’s internal network, or on a private basis between 
  one or more parties using a variety of security mechanisms to 
  prohibit general public access. 
   
  If such data was distributed in an open DNS system, a national 
  regulatory body may have jurisdiction, especially since CNAM 
  information may contain Personally Identifying Information.  Such a 
  body may choose to restrict distribution of the data in such a way 
  that it may not pass over that country’s national borders.  How 
  Personally Identifying Information is collected, distributed and 
  subsequently regulated is out of the scope of this document.

  This section documents several examples of how this protocol is used 
  for illustrative purposes only.

8.   Usage Considerations  

   
  Typically, the Calling Name data in the PSTN is delivered to the 
  called party during the first silent interval after the first ring of 
  the phone.  (see GR-1188 requirement R3-341 [13]).  If the Called 
  party answers the call before this, Calling Name data may not be 
  delivered. 
   
  This protocol could be invoked, for example, when a user agent within 
  a service provider’s network receives an INVITE without a display 
  name present. 
   
  The exact mechanism or determination of when to issue an ENUM-CNAM 
  request, and the formatting of SIP [18] messages is beyond the scope 
  of this document. 
   
   
9.   Privacy Considerations 
 
  It is assumed that carriers, service providers, or other 
  organizations that originate Calling Name data will not publish such 
  information in a globally visible DNS tree, such as e164.arpa for 
  reasons of personal privacy protection unless such publication is 
  consistent with national regulatory policy.  
   
  Service providers and other organizations will probably privately 
  exchange and publish this data in their internally cached ENUM 
  databases, which is only able to be queried by trusted elements of 
  their network, such as soft switches and SIP [18] proxy servers. 
   
  Service providers using this query response technique are advised 
  that many national jurisdictions have strict regulations on the use 
  of Calling Name data and that National Regulatory Authorities may 
  have special regulations that permit subscribers to block the use of 
  such data before call setup.  Other jurisdictions have services known 
  as anonymous caller rejection, meaning that calls made from a system 
  where Calling Line Identification and Calling Name data are blocked 
  are prevented from establishing a session. 
   
10.   Security Considerations

  Use of the CNAM Enumservice shall either be within a service 
  provider's internal network, or on a private basis between one or 
  more parties using a variety of security mechanisms to prevent 
  general public access.  It should be noted that this content type is 
  designed to carry potentially personal information and as such, may 
  be subject to restrictions within various national jurisdictions. 
   
  The CNAM Enumservice defined in this document is assumed to be used 
  in an environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are 
  not supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those   
  elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes   
  achieved by using IPSec [A] and sometimes by physically protecting 
  the underlying network.  In any case, it is presumed the environment 
  where the CNAM request-response mechanism will be used can ensure the 
  integrity and the confidentiality of the contents of the CNAM data. 
   
   
   
                                                            
11.   IANA Considerations 

 
  This document registers the 'cnam' Enumservice using the type 'pstn' 
  and the subtype 'cnam' in the Enumservice registry described in the 
  IANA considerations in RFC 3761.  Details of this registration are 
  provided in sections 13 and 14 of this document. 
   
  This document also registers with the IANA the URI 'pstn:' per RFC 
  4395 
   
   
11.1 IANA Enumservice Registration for PSTN Data "cnam" 
   
  Enumservice Name: "cnam" 
   
  Enumservice Type: "pstn" 
   
  Enumservice Subtypes: "cnam" 
   
  URI Schemes: "pstn:" 
   
  Functional Specification: 
   
  This Enumservice indicates that a resource record contains Calling 
  Name Delivery Information that can be addressed by the associated 
  'pstn:' URI scheme in order to facilitate the display of Calling 
  Party information from a PSTN endpoint to a VoIP Client User Agent or 
  other application.   
   
  Security Considerations: See Section 9.

  Encoding considerations. 
   
  The purpose of this URI is to enable service providers to place 
  Calling Name Delivery information (CNAM) into RFC 3761 [ENUM] 
  databases or to send ENUM queries to a protocol converter that would 
  have access to the Signaling System 7 (SS7) Network.  This, in turn, 
  could enable such parties to offer Calling Name Delivery services 
  using the technology provided by RFC 3761. 
   
  The information stored in these databases can be encoded to 
  facilitate storage and retrieval operations.  The type of encoding 
  used is identified using appropriate media type parameters.  If not 
  otherwise identified, character data is presumed to be encoded using 
  US-ASCII [9]. 
   
  Applications and/or protocols that use this URI scheme name. 
   
  This URI scheme is intended for use in RFC 3761 [ENUM] databases. 
   
  Interoperability considerations. 
   
  The URI is designed to be used specifically in conjunction with 
  systems that utilize the RFC 3761 [ENUM] databases.  
   
  Security considerations: 
   
  The distribution of CNAM data is often highly restricted.  
  Distribution of this data would typically be either within a service 
  provider’s internal network, or on a private basis between one or 
  more parties using a variety of security mechanisms to prohibit 
  general public access.  It should be noted that this content type is 
  designed to carry potentially personal information and as such, may 
  be subject to restrictions within various national jurisdictions. 
   
  The pstn URI defined in this document is assumed to be used in an 
  environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are not 
  supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those   
  elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes
