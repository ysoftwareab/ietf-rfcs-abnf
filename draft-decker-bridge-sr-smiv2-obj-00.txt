          Internet Draft SR Bridge MIB in the SNMPv2 SMI        Feb 1996


          1.  Introduction

          This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
          (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
          Internet community.  In particular, it defines managed objects
          used for managing source routing and source routing
          transparent bridges.  These bridges are also required to
          implement relevant groups in the Bridge MIB [8].

          The MIB module contained in this memo is updated to be defined
          using the SNMPv2 SMI [1], but is otherwise identical to that
          contained in [18].

          2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

          The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of three
          major components.  They are:

          o    RFC 1902 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
               for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.

          o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of
               managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

          o    RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4] which defines the
               protocol used for network access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.


          2.1.  Object Definitions

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
          object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an
          administratively assigned name.  The object type together with
          an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
          object type.

          Internet Draft SR Bridge MIB in the SNMPv2 SMI        Feb 1996


          3.  Overview

          A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This
          device is used to connect Local Area Network segments below
          the network layer.  There are two major modes defined for this
          bridging; transparent and source route.  The transparent
          method of bridging is defined in the IEEE 802.1d MAC Bridge
          specification [11].  Source route bridging has been defined by
          I.B.M. and is described in the Token Ring Architecture
          Reference[12], as well as the IEEE 802.5M SRT Bridge
          Operations Addendum [14] to 802.1d.  This memo defines objects
          needed for management of a source routing bridge, and is an
          extension to the SNMP Bridge MIB [8].

          An explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as simple as
          possible.  This was accomplished by applying the following
          criteria to objects proposed for inclusion:

          (1)  Start with a small set of essential objects and add only
               as further objects are needed.

          (2)  Require objects be essential for either fault or
               configuration management.

          (3)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

          (4)  Limit the total of objects.

          (5)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
               this or other MIBs.

          (6)  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily
               instrumented.  The guideline that was followed is one
               counter per critical section per layer.


          3.1.  Structure of MIB

          Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
          organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure
          and assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.
          Where appropriate, the corresponding management object name
          found in IEEE 802.1d[11] and IEEE 802.5M [14] is also
          included.

          Internet Draft SR Bridge MIB in the SNMPv2 SMI        Feb 1996


          3.1.1.  The dot1dSr Group

          This group contains the objects that describe the entity's
          state with respect to source route bridging.  If source
          routing is not supported, this group will not be implemented.
          This group is applicable to source route only, and SRT
          bridges.

          3.1.2.  The dot1dPortPair Group

          Implementation of this group is optional.  This group is
          implemented by those bridges that support the port-pair
          multiport model of the source route bridging mode as defined
          in the IEEE 802.5M SRT Addendum to 802.1d.

          3.2.  Relationship to Other MIBs

          As described above, some IEEE 802.1d management objects have
          not been included in this MIB because they overlap with
          objects in other MIBs applicable to a bridge implementing this
          MIB.  In particular, it is assumed that a bridge implementing
          this MIB will also implement (at least) the Bridge MIB [8] and
          the 'system' group [16] and the 'interfaces' group [17].

          3.2.1.  Relationship to the Bridge MIB

          The Bridge MIB [8] must be implemented by all bridges,
          including transparent, SR and SRT bridges.  The SR bridge MIB
          is an extension to the Bridge MIB.


          3.2.2.  Relationship to the 'system' group

          In [16], the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for
          all systems such that each managed entity contains one
          instance of each object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those
          objects apply to the entity as a whole irrespective of whether
          the entity's sole functionality is bridging, or whether
          bridging is only a subset of the entity's functionality.


          3.2.3.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' group

          In [17], the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory
          for all systems and contains information on an entity's

          Internet Draft SR Bridge MIB in the SNMPv2 SMI        Feb 1996


          interfaces, where each interface is thought of as being
          attached to a `subnetwork'.  (Note that this term is not to be
          confused with `subnet' which refers to an addressing
          partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of protocols.)
          The term 'segment' is used in this memo to refer to such a
          subnetwork.

          Implicit in this MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each
          of these ports is associated with one interface of the
          'interfaces' group, and in most situations, each port is
          associated with a different interface. However, there are
          situations in which multiple ports are associated with the
          same interface.  An example of such a situation would be
          several ports, each corresponding one-to-one with several X.25
          virtual circuits, but all on the same interface.

          Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port
          number has no mandatory relationship to an interface number,
          but in the simple case, a port number will have the same value
          as the corresponding interface's interface number.

          Some entities provide other services in addition to bridging
          with respect to the data sent and received by their
          interfaces.  In such situations, only a subset of the data
          sent/received on an interface is within the domain of the
          entity's bridging functionality.  This subset is considered to
          be delineated according to a set of protocols, with some
          protocols being bridged, and other protocols not being
          bridged. For example, in an entity which exclusively performed
          bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged,
          whereas in an entity which performed IP routing on IP
          datagrams and only bridged other protocols, only the non-IP
          data would be considered as being bridged.

          Thus, this MIB (and in particular, its counters) are
          applicable only to that subset of the data on an entity's
          interfaces which is sent/received for a protocol being
          bridged.  All such data is sent/received via the ports of the
          bridge.


          4.  Changes from RFC 1525

          (1)  Removed dot1dSrPortLanIdMismatches, as it is redundant
               with dot1dSrPortSegmentMismatchDiscards.

          (2)  Replaced the words "explorer frames" in the definition of
               dot1dSrPortSegmentMismatchDiscards with the words "ARE
               and STE explorer frames" for clarification.

          (3)  Revised definition of dot1dSrPortHopCount.
