 Abstract


   In this draft, we propose a guideline for an improved version of
   router handling procedures in RFC 2461 that allow for improved 
   default router acquisition performance when an active IP host moves
   from one subnet to the other using the Path Computation Element 
   Metric Protocol (PCEMP). Router handling procedures can be improved
   by a soft configuration of PCEMP support in the context of 
   real-time data driven strategy on individual PCE nodes. 


   This draft is an informational draft that shows a guideline to 
   specifications of modifying existing protocols to facilitate 
   communication between LSRs and PCEs, and between a PCE and other
   PCEs. This can also be a guideline for mobile PCE nodes changing
   respective PCEDAs and thus needing fast advertisements to the 
   corresponding LSRs and other PCE peers using IPv6 schemes.

1. Terminology
    


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


   
   This memo makes use of the following terms: 
    
   1. Path Computation Element (PCE): an entity that is responsible 
      for computing/finding inter/intra domain LSPs. This entity can 
      simultaneously act as a client and a server. Several PCEs can 
      be deployed in a given AS.                                      


   2. Path Computation Element node (PCE Node): a network processing 
      unit comprising of a PCE unit. This can be embedded in a router
      or a switch.  
 
   3. Domain: Denotes an Autonomous system (AS) within the scope of
      this draft.

2. Introduction


  According to RFC 2461 [1] , a participating router MUST delay a 
  response to a Router Solicitation (RS) by a random time between 0 
  and MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME seconds. The idea behind MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME is
  that if there is more than one router on the link, simultaneously 
  transmitted responses will collide if the routers try to answer
  the RS immediately, and, additionally, to avoid congestion when
  a link comes up and all hosts on the link solicit.


  This can be a performance bottleneck in the case of default
  PCE peer acquisition for PCE nodes that are moving between 
  PCEDAs [2]. The PCEMP protocol architecture enable the 
  corresponding PCE peers to exchange information tags instantaneously 
  upon discovery at any point of time. The concept of synchonization 
  of information between PCE nodes even in the case of a change in the 
  corresponding PCEDA can help in fast default PCE peer acquistion. 
  


3. Fast PCE peer advertisement


  To enable fast response time in PCE peer solicitation processing, 
  at most one PCE node on any given PCEDA SHOULD be allowed to 
  respond immediately to the PCE peer solicitations sent out by PCE 
  peers on that PCEDA. 


  This mechanism is enabled using the SCM based fast computation
  techniques defined in [2]. 



4. Fast processing of PCE peer solicitations


4.1 PCE peer architecture as seen by the PCEMP protocol


  These are the PCE unit architectures as seen by the PCEMP protocol 
  state machines during path computation: 


  1. A matrix and parallel vector arithmetic unit that provides 
  parallel data processing capabilities on the commonly used matrix 
  and vector mathematical data types. Performance of this unit is 
  independent of the size of the data vector under computation. This 
  is implemented in the CC and SPC [2].

Internet Draft      draft-choi-pcemp-ipv6-00.txt        October 2004


  2. The processing core that provides the ease of programming and 
  flexibility to address changing algorithms and standards. There 
  exists a one-to-one map from the transform computed by the core 
  to the high-level code generated by the PCE application. This is 
  implemented using soft memory techniques in the CC, SPC and SCM.  


  3. A high-speed I/O system that allows complex, adaptive 
  algorithms to be partitioned cost-effectively across multiple sub 
  PCE unit blocks by providing dual ports. These ports are logically 
  indistinguishable across the ordered pair of a data vector and the 
  corresponding transform that is executed. 


  These units are images of the PCE computing unit that are mapped 
  onto the PCEMP state machines.



4.2 Realization of fast path computing unit architecture using PCEMP


  Concept: Iterative applications of the PCEMP DS. Two or more
  IDT [2] encoders separated by an interleaver (respectively CC and 
  SPC). This structure suggests a decoding strategy based on the 
  iterative passing of soft-computing information between two 
  decoding algorithms. This is equivalent to dynamically partitioning 
  the path computing engine core into sub-units that are linked 
  together real-time based on the input data and the protocol handler. 


  Basic Computation: Configure PCEMP DS to compute soft-decisions in 
  terms of measures. An assigned measure is given to each branch of 
  the IDT. 


4.3 Configuration of PCE peers for fast processing of solicitations


  A PCE peer that is configured to provide fast solicitation 
  processing maintains a soft decision counter and multiple IDT 
  encoders in the form of CCs and SPCs. This might not be physical
  hardware, the entities may be capable of a soft configuration on
  individual LSRs and PCEs. 



J.K.Choi, D.Guha            Informational                   [Page 5]


Internet Draft      draft-choi-pcemp-ipv6-00.txt        October 2004



  From [2], we know that there are two distinct finite state machine 
  handlings of the PCEMP protocol architecture that are configured
  on each participating PCE peer. They are when the PCE unit block 
  is invoked for constantly changing data profiles within the time
  of goodness of fit (MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT), and the case where the PCE
  unit block is invoked only once for a variable data profile and 
  the data tagged (tags) within MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT.  


  When a PCE peer solicitation request is received, the corresponding
  PCE node ACK MUST be sent immediately if:


         CC & SPC IDT encoder count <= max tags (MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT)


  where max tags determine the computing potential within 
  MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT [2]. 


  A PCE peer SHOULD unicast the response directly to the soliciting 
  PCE node's address, else it SHOULD schedule a multicast Router 
  Advertisement in accordance with RFC 2461.


  When a PCE node ACK is sent, the IDT encoder count is not
  incremented but a corresponding flag written on the output branch
  measure using the z-parameter [2].


  This process ensures that the IDT encoder count never exceeds 
  max tags (MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT). If there is such a possibility, the 
  PCEDA partitioning is recomputed by the PCE node. 



5. Security Considerations


  The impact of the use of the PCEMP architecture is relatively much 
  secure as the PCEDA are computed and distributed internal to the 
  PCE unit. An increase in inter-domain information flows and the 
  facilitation of inter-domain path establishment through PCEMP does 
  not increase the existing vulnerability to security attacks. It 
  should be remembered that PCEMP works by an invoked logic scheme 
  local to each participating PCE unit, and the protocol scheme is 
  brought into play only when there is a significant change in the 
  data profile within the time of goodness of fit.



J.K.Choi, D.Guha            Informational                   [Page 6]


Internet Draft      draft-choi-pcemp-ipv6-00.txt        October 2004


  The corresponding upper bound 
  max tags (MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT) / MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT may be a useful
  metric to limit the advertisement's response rate. 


  However, it is expected that the PCE solutions will address 
  security issues mentioned in [Ash] in details using authentication 
  and security techniques.
