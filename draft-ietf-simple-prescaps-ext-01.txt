Abstract

   Interoperation of Instant Messaging and Presence systems has been
   defined in the IMPP working group.  The IMPP WG has come up with
   baseline interoperable operations and formats for presence and
   instant messaging systems.  However, these base formats might need
   standardized extensions in order to enable building rational
   applications using presence and instant messaging.  This memo
   proposes an extension  to represent "Indicating User Agent
   Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" capabilities

Internet-Draft    User Agent Capability Presence Status Extension  May 2004


1.  Introduction

   Interoperation of instant messaging and presence systems has been
   defined in IMPP working group.  Working group has defined "A model
   for Presence and Instant Messaging" RFC2778 [2] and also requirements
   for protocols implementing such a system in RFC 2779 [3].  Common
   presence (CPP) [5] and instant messaging  (CPIM) [11] define common
   operations and formats which all  Presence and Instant Messaging
   services must agree upon so that basic interoperability would be
   possible.  The actual base format for the presence is defined in the
   Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) [4].  The PIDF document
   format has been designed to reduce the need for gatewaying and to
   allow end-to-end security of presence data.  It has taken very
   minimalistic approach to support such operations.  In order to make
   the PIDF format usable by different presence applications, these
   applications usually must extend the basic PIDF format by standard
   XML mechanism as defined in the PIDF [4].

   The aim of this memo is to introduce SIP/SIMPLE specific extension
   mechanism for the PIDF document.  With this extension SIMPLE based
   applications can have richer and more usable formats compared to the
   baseline PIDF data format.  Aim of this document is to introduce
   extension for "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)" [6].

1.1  Motivation

   The PIDF document format [4] defines a <contact> element which may
   appear once inside every <tuple> element.  The content of the
   <contact>  element encodes the CONTACT ADDRESS and CONTACT MEANS as
   defined in RFC2778 [2].  The <contact> element is defined to be an
   URI.  This URI can be of any URI type.  In some implementations this
   URI can uniquely identify the application the tuple intends to
   describe (e.g.  im: URIs usually represent Instant Messaging
   service).  However, this may not be the case in all implementations.
   For example in SIP, a SIP URI can represent different kinds of
   applications.  A SIP URI can be used to contact voice applications,
   video applications, or messaging applications.  If it is not known by
   other means, it might be hard for applications processing the
   presence document containing only SIP URI contact addresses to know
   what particular application the tuple intends to describe.  Also
   watchers receiving presence information would probably benefit for
   getting more descriptive information about what particular
   communication means or applications are supported by the presentity.

   "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)" document [6] defines a set of extensions which allow
   callees to express preferences about request handling in SIP servers.

Internet-Draft    User Agent Capability Presence Status Extension  May 2004


   The same information can provide value also to presence watchers so
   that they can make more rational decisions on how presentity should
   be contacted if presence document would contain similar information
   as defined in "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)" extension.

1.2  Scope

   This document defines extension to the PIDF document format which
   enables presence implementations based on SIP protocol to utilize
   similar capabilities in presence document as what "Indicating User
   Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" document
   [6] defines.

   This extension does not replace media negotiation mechanisms defined
   for SIP (e.g.  SDP [15]).  This extension is only aimed to give the
   watchers hints about the presentity's preferences, willingness and
   capabilities to communicate before watchers would initiate
   communication with the presentity.

2.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in RFC2778 [2], and in
   PIDF [4].

3.  Extension for "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)" in PIDF documents

   This section presents "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" extension namespace, its elements,
   their values, and semantics.  This section also describes how this
   extension can be further extended.  Extension is intended to be used
   with "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf" namespace and that particular
   usage is described here.  This extension may also be used with other
   namespaces if appropriate.

3.1  Extension overview

   This extension adds features presented in "Indicating User Agent
   Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" document [6]
   into the PIDF presence document format.  Extension also includes type
   feature tag RFC2913 [7] and language feature tag RFC2987 [8]
   definitions.  Features presented in "Indicating User Agent

Internet-Draft    User Agent Capability Presence Status Extension  May 2004


   Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"[6], RFC2913
   [7], and RFC2987 [8] are used here without any change in their
   semantics.  Bringing these features to the PIDF presence document
   format basically means mapping them to XML formatted structure.
   Namespace identifier for this extension is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-prescaps-ext

   When this extension namespace is congregated with the PIDF document,
   combined document must follow the same general formatting rules as
   specified in the PIDF [4] in Section 4.1.

Internet-Draft    User Agent Capability Presence Status Extension  May 2004


3.18  <extensions> element

   The <extensions> element is a list of SIP extensions (each of which
   is defined by an option-tag registered with IANA) that are understood
   by the UA.  Understood, in this context, means that the option tag
   would be included in a Supported header field in a request as defined
   in [6].

   <extensions> element can contain any number of <extension> elements
   which can be used to describe individual extensions supported by the
   device.

   'negated' attribute is 'false'.

3.19  <schemes> element

   The <schemes> element provides the set of URI schemes that are
   supported by a UA.  Supported implies, for example, that the UA would
   know how to handle a URI of that scheme in the Contact header field
   of a redirect response as defined in [6].

   <schemes> element can contain any number of <scheme> elements which
   can be used to describe individual schemes supported by the device.

3.19.1  <scheme>

   o  principal: The device provides communication with the principal
      that is associated with the device.  Often this will be a specific
      human being, but it can be an automata (for example, when calling
      a voice portal).

   o  attendant: The device provides communication with an automaton or
      person that will act as an intermediary in contacting the
      principal associated with the device, or a substitute.

   o  msg-taker: The device provides communication with an automaton or
      person that will take messages and deliver them to the principal.

   o  information: The device provides communication with an automaton
      or person that will provide information about the principal.


3.21  <is-focus> element

   The <is-focus> element indicates that the UA is a conference server,
   also known as a focus, and will mix together the media for all calls
   to the same URI as defined in [6].

   The <is-focus> element is of boolean type and does not have any
   attributes.

3.22  <languages> element

   The <languages> element indicates Ability to display particular human
   languages as as defined in [8].

   <languages> element can contain any number of <language> elements
   which can be used to describe individual languages supported by the
   device.

3.22.1  <language>

   The <language> is string type element and it is used to describe
   individual language supported by the device.  The <language> element
   can contain 'negated' attribute.  This attribute is of boolean type.
   Value 'false' indicates that device supports particular language and
   value 'true' indicates that device does not support particular
   language as defined in [6].  Default value for 'negated' attribute is
   'false'.

4.  Publishing and using 'prescaps' elements

   In "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)" [6] it is recommended that a UA provides complete



Lonnfors & Kiss         Expires November 5, 2004               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    User Agent Capability Presence Status Extension  May 2004


   information in its contact predicate.  However, it may be that
   presentity is not willing to publish presence information which would
   be consistent with actual device capabilities (e.g.  presentity may
   not want to indicate that he/she supports voice when the device
   actually is able to support it).  Also authorization rules or
   policies in presence server may limit or modify the published
   presence information in a way that all published presence information
   may not end up to all possible watchers.

   It is RECOMMENTED that Presence User Agent (PUA) using this extension
   provides as complete presence information as it can.  However, it is
   not mandated that this presence information should be consistent with
   actual device capabilities.  Also, watchers should not expect that
   presence information represented by this extension fully represents
   actual presentity's device capabilities.

5.  Using extension with PIDF document format

   PIDF format allows use of extension XML namespaces inside <presence>,
   <tuple>, and <status> elements.  <presence> element is intended to
   describe presentity as a whole.  PIDF extension namespace defined in
   this document relates to contact address defined by PIDF <contact>
   element to which this extension is applied to.  These contact
   addresses can only appear inside <tuple> elements as defined in the
   PIDF [4].  PIDF extension namespace defined in this document SHOULD
   be placed inside <status> element.  Root element <prescaps> MUST NOT
   appear more than once inside a single  <tuple> element but MAY appear
   multiple times in PIDF document format inside different <tuple>
   elements.

5.1  Contact URI

   "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)" [6]  has restrictions what kind of URIs can be used
   with callee capabilities.  As Address of Record of the presentity
   represents the union of all presentity's device capabilities it is
   RECOMMENTED that contact URI in <contact> element used with this
   specifications SHOULD be Address of Record of the presentity.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace URN as
   defined in [9]

8.1   URN sub-namespace registration for
    'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-prescaps-ext'

   URI:
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-prescaps-ext

   Description:
   This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by [[[RFCXXXX]]]
   to describe user agent capability extension for PIDF presence
   document format in application/pidf+xml content type.

   Registrant Contact:
   IETF, SIMPLE working group, <simple@ietf.org>
   Mikko Lonnfors, <mikko.lonnfors@nokia.com>

9.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations specified in CPIM [5] and in PIDF [4]

   documents apply to this document.  Compared to PIDF [4] this presence
   document format may reveal additional information about user's device
   capabilities.

   Because presence is very privacy-sensitive information, the transport
   protocol for the presence information SHOULD have capabilities to
   protect protocol messages from possible threats, such as
   eavesdropping, corruption, tamper and replay attacks.  The protocols
   SHOULD be able to use security mechanisms which are standardized or
   being standardized in IETF.  However, it depends on the actual
   transport protocols which security mechanisms should be used, and it
   is beyond the scope of this memo.
