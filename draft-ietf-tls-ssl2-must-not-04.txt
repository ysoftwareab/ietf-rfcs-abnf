Abstract 

   This document requires that when TLS clients and servers establish 
   connections that they never negotiate the use of Secure Sockets Layer 
   (SSL) version 2.0.  This document updates the backward compatibility 
   sections found in the Transport Security Layer (TLS).

1. Introduction 

   Many protocols specified in the IETF rely on Transport Layer Security 
   (TLS) [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2] for security services.  This is a good 
   thing, but some TLS clients and servers also support negotiating the 
   use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0 [SSL2]; however, this 
   version does not provide a sufficiently high level of security. SSL 
   version 2.0 has known deficiencies. This document describes those 
   deficiencies, and it requires TLS clients and servers never negotiate 
   the use of SSL version 2.0. 

   TLS 1.1 [RFC4346] and later in TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] explicitly warned 
   implementers that the "ability to send version 2.0 CLIENT-HELLO 
   messages will be phased out with all due haste."  This document 
   accomplishes this by updating the backward compatibility sections 
   found in TLS [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2]. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119]. 

2. SSL 2.0 Deficiencies 

   SSL version 2.0 [SSL2] deficiencies include: 

   o Message authentication uses MD5 [MD5].  Most security-aware users 
     have already moved away from any use of MD5 
     [I-D.turner-md5-seccon-update]. 

   o Handshake messages are not protected.  This permits a man-in-the-
     middle to trick the client into picking a weaker cipher suite than 
     they would normally choose.

   o Message integrity and message encryption use the same key, which is 
     a problem if the client and server negotiate a weak encryption 
     algorithm. 

   o Sessions can be easily terminated.  A man-in-the-middle can easily 
     insert a TCP FIN to close the session and the peer is unable to 
     determine whether or not it was a legitimate end of the session. 

3. Changes to TLS 

   Because of the deficiencies noted in the previous section: 

   o TLS clients MUST NOT send the SSL version 2.0 compatible CLIENT-
     HELLO message format. Clients MUST NOT send any client hello 
     message which specifies a protocol version less than 
     { 0x03, 0x00 }. As previously stated by the definitions of all 
     previous versions of TLS, the client SHOULD specify the highest 
     protocol version it supports.  

   o TLS servers MAY continue to accept CLIENT-HELLO messages in the 
     version 2 CLIENT-HELLO format as specified in TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] 
     Appendix E.2. Note that this does not contradict the prohibition 
     against actually negotiating the use of SSL 2.0.  

     TLS Servers MUST NOT reply with a SSL 2.0 SERVER-HELLO with a 
     protocol version which is less than { 0x03, 0x00 } and instead 
     MUST abort the connection, i.e., when the highest protocol version 
     offered by the client is { 0x02, 0x00 } the TLS connection will be 
     refused.  

   Note that the number of servers that support this above-mentioned 
   "MAY accept" implementation option is declining, and the SSL 2.0 
   CLIENT-HELLO precludes the use of TLS protocol enhancements that 
   require TLS extensions. TLS extensions can only be sent as part of an 
   (Extended) ClientHello handshake message. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This entire document is about security considerations. 

6. Acknowledgements

   Saint Andre, Simon Josefsson, and others on the XMPP mailing list.
