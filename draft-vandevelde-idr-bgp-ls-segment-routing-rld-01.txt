1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing tunnels are computed by a centralised
   controller, it is beneficial that the controller knows the RLD
   "Readable Label Depth" of each node the computed tunnel traverses.

   RLD awareness of each node will allow the network SDN controller to
   influence the path used for each tunnel.  The SDN controller may for
   example only create tunnels with a label stack smaller or equal as
   the RLD of each node on the path.  This will allow the network to
   behave accordingly (e.g.  make use of Entropy Labels to improve ECMP)
   upon the imposed Segment Routing labels on each packet.

   This document describes how to use BGP-LS to expose the RLD of a
   node.

3.  Problem Statement

   In existing technology both ISIS [4] and OSPF [3] have proposed
   extensions to signal the Readable Label Depth of a node.  However, if
   a network SDN controller is connected to the network through a BGP-LS
   session and not through ISIS or OSPF technology, then the RLD needs
   to be conveyed in BGP-LS accordingly.  This document describes the
   extension BGP-LS requires to transport the RLD.

   A network SDN controller having awareness of the Readable Label Depth
   can for example use it as a constraint on path computation so that it
   can make sure that high bandwidth LSPs are not placed on LAG links
   with smaller member bandwidths if they know the Entropy Label cannot
   be processed by the node at the ingress to the link.

4.  RLD support by a node

   Node RLD is encoded in a new Node Attribute TLV, as defined in
   RFC7752 [2].

      RLD: Node RLD is a number in the range of 0-254.  The value of 0
      represents lack of ability to read a label stack of any depth, any
      other value represents the readable label depth of the node.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security issues beyond those
   discussed in RFC7752 [2]

6.  Acknowledgements

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning 1 new code-points from the BGP-LS
   Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs registry as specified in sections 4.
