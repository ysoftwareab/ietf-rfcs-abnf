                     Identity Header Error Handling
          draft-wendt-stir-identity-header-errors-handling-00

Abstract

   This document extends STIR and the Authenticated Identity Management
   in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) related to error handling
   for STIR verification services and how they feedback errors to STIR
   authentication services.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8224] in Section 6.2.2 discusses future specifications for
   enhancement of how errors are communicated and the handling of
   multiple identity headers.  This specification provides some
   additional mechanisms for solutions to address these problems.

   In some deployments of STIR and specifically using SIP [RFC3261] as
   defined by [RFC8224], one issue with the current error handling,
   specifically with the use of the defined 4xx error responses, is that
   when an error occurs with the verification of the identity header or
   the PASSporT contained in the identity header and a 4xx response is
   returned, the call is then terminated.  It may be the case that the
   policy for handling errors might be that calls should continue even
   if there is a verification error, in the case of, for example
   inadvertent errors, however the authentication service should still
   be notified of the error so that corrective action can be taken.
   This specification will discuss the use of reason header in
   subsequent provisional (1xx) responses in order to accomplish this.

   For the handling of multiple identity headers and the potential
   situation that some of the identity headers in a call may pass
   verification but others may have errors, this document provides a
   mechanism to add an identifier so that the authentication service can
   identify which identity header is being referred to in the case of an
   error.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use of provisional error responses to signal errors without
    terminating the call

   In cases where local policy dictates that a call should not terminate
   when any verification errors, including errors described in [RFC8224]
   Section 6.2.2, then the verification service SHOULD include the error
   response code and reason phrase in a Reason header field, defined in
   [RFC3326], in the next provisional or final response sent to the
   authentication service.

   Example Reason header field:

   Reason: SIP ;cause=436 ;text="Bad Identity Info"

4.  Handling of errors when there is multiple identity headers

   In cases where a SIP message includes multiple identity headers and
   one or more of those identity headers has errors the verification
   service SHOULD include the error response code and reason phrase in a
   Reason header field, defined in [RFC3326], in the next provisional or
   final response sent to the authentication service.  The reason cause
   SHOULD represent at least one of the errors that occurred with one of
   the identity headers, but in order to identify each of the associated
   identity headers that had errors the body of the response should
   include a multipart MIME with each section including the PASSporT of
   the corresponding identity header.

   Example Reason header field with multipart MIME body:
