  GMPLS Routing and Signaling Framework for Flexible Ethernet (FlexE)
                      draft-izh-ccamp-flexe-fwk-02

Abstract

   This document specifies GMPLS Control Plane Signalling and Routing
   protocol extensions for Flexible Ethernet (FlexE).  The FlexE data
   plane were specified by Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) in two
   implementation agreements in 2016.

   As different from earlier Ethernet data planes FlexE allows for
   decoupling of the Ethernet Physical layer (PHY) and Media Access
   Control layer (MAC) rates.

   This document also specifies the use cases of FlexE technology, GMPLS
   control plane requirements, framework and architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates
   of the Ethernet PHY(s).  OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3] was
   the first step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY
   rates standardized by IEEE.  A recently approved implementation
   agreement [OIFFLEXE1] allows for complete decoupling of the MAC data
   rates and the Ethernet PHY(s).

   This includes support for

   a.  MAC rates which are greater than the rate of a single PHY
       (multiple PHYs) are bonded to achive this

   b.  MAC rates which are less than the rate of a PHY (sub-rate)

   c.  support of multiple FlexE CLients carried over a single PHY, or
       over a collection of bonded PHY).

   The capabilities supported by the FlexE implementation agreement
   version 1.0 are:

   a.  Support a large rate Ethernet MAC over bonded Ethernet PHYs, e.g.
       supporting a 200G MAC over 2 bonded 100GBASE-R PHY(s)

   b.  Support a sub-rate Ethernet MAC over a single Ethernet PHY, e.g.
       supportnig a 50G MAC over a 100GBASE-R PHY

   c.  Support a collection of flexible Ethernet clients over a single
       Ethernet PHY, e.g. supporting two MACs with the rates 25G, 50G
       over a single 100GBASE-R PHY

   d.  Support a sub-rate Ethernet MAC over bonded PHYs, e.g. supporting
       a 150G Ethernet client over 2 bonded 100GBASE-R PHY(s)

   e.  Support a collection of Ethernet MAC clients over bonded Ethernet
       PHYs, e.g. supporting a 50G, and 150G MAC over 2 bonded Ethernet
       PHY(s)

   All networks which support the bonding of Ehernet interfaces (as per
   [OIFFLEXE1]) include a basic building block -- which consists of two
   FlexE Shim functions (located at opposite ends of a link) and the
   (logical) point to point links that carry the Ethernet PHY signals
   between the two FlexE Shim Functions.  These logical point-to-point
   PHY links can be realized in a variety of ways:

   a.  These are direct point-to-point links with no intervening
       transport network.

   b.  The Ethernet PHY(s) are transparently transported via an Optical
       Transport Network.  Optical Transport Networks (defined by
       [G.709] and [G798]) have recently expanded the traditional bit
       (or codeword) transparent transport of Ethernet client signals,
       and included support for the usecases identified in the OIF FlexE
       implementation agreement.

   c.  Realized by tunneling the Ethernet PHY(s) over some other type of
       network (e.g.  IP/MPLS).  Thus, for example, the Ethernet PHY(s)
       signals could be carried over a pseudowire (or a LSP)in the IP/
       MPLS network.  Note that the OIF implementation agreement
       [OIFFLEXE1]  only includes support for 100G Ethernet PHY(s).  As
       a result of this encapsulation into a PW, the bandwidth of the PW
       will be much larger than the bit rate of the Ethernet PHY (i.e.
       100G), and such a pseudowire cannot be transported in networks
       that only include 100G Ethernet links.  This scenario is
       realizable when (a) higher rate Ethernet PHY(s), e.g. 200G/40G
       are supported) or (b) OIF extends the FlexE groups to include
       lower rate Ethernet PHY(s), e.g. at the 25G/50G rate.  Further
       study is needed to ensure that these scenarios are realizable,
       practical, and beneficial to operators.  With this in mind, the
       current draft doesn't include any coverage for this scenario.

   This Internet-draft examines the usescases that arise when the
   logical links between FlexE capable devices are (a) point-to-point
   links without any intervening network (b) realized via Optical
   transport networks.  This draft considers the variants in which fhe
   two peer FlexE devices are both customer-edge devices, or customer-
   edge/provider edge devices.  This list of usecases will help identify
   the Control Plane (i.e.  Routing and Signaling) extensions that may
   be required.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   a.  CE (Customer Edge) - the group of functions that support the
       termination/orignation of data received from or sent to the
       network,

   b.  Crunching: (Editors note: text to be submitted>)

   c.  Ethernet PHY: an entity representing 100G-R Physical Coding
       Sublayer (PCS), Physical Media Attachment (PMA), and Physical
       Media Dependent (PMD) layers.

   d.  FlexE Calendar: The total capacity of a FlexE group is
       represented as a collection of slots which have a granularty of
       5G.  The calendar for a FlexE group composed of n 100G PHYs is
       represented as an array of 20n slots (each representing 5G of
       bandwidth).  This calendar is partitioned into sub-calendars,
       with 20 slots per 100G PHY.  Each FlexE client is mapped into one
       or more calendar slots (based on the bandwidth of the FlexE
       client).

   e.  FlexE Client: an Ethernet flow based on a MAC data rate that may
       or may not correspond to any Ethernet PHY rate.

   f.  FlexE Group: A FlexE Group is composed of from 1 to n Ethernet
       PHYs.  In the first version of FlexE each PHY is identified by a
       number in the range [1-254].

   g.  FlexE Interface: A logic interface that is composed of from 1 to
       n Ethernet interfaces.

   h.  FlexE Link: A logic link that connects two FexE interfaces
       residing in two adjacent nodes.

   i.  FlexE Shim: the layer that maps or demaps the FlexE clients
       carried over a FlexE group.

   j.  FlexE Sub-Interface: A channelized logic sub-interface that is
       allocated specific slots from a FlexE interface, the number of
       slots depends on the rate of the FlexE Client that will be
       transmitted through this sub-interface.

   k.  FlexE Sub-Link: A logic link that connects two FlexE sub-
       interfaces that residing in two adjacent nodes.

3.  Usecases

3.1.  FlexE Unware transport

   The FlexE Shim layer in a router maps the FlexE client(s) over the
   FlexE group.  The transport network is unware of the FlexE.  Each of
   the FlexE group PHY is carried independently across the transport
   network over the same fiber route.  The FlexE Shim in the router
   tolerates end-to-end skew across the network.  In this usecase, the
   router makes flexible use of the full capacity of the FlexE group,
   and depends on legacy transport equipment to realize PCS-codeword-
   transparent transport of 100GbE.  It allows striping of PHYs in the
   FlexE group over multiple line cards in the transport equipment.  It
   is worth mentioning that in this case, the FlexE Shim layer is
   terminated at the routers, and the coordination of operations related
   to FlexE clients, e.g. creating new FlexE clients, deleting existing
   FlexE clients, and resizing the bandwidth of existing FlexE clients
   (if desired) happens between the two routers.  Note that the
   transport network is completely transparent to the FlexE signals, and
   doesn't participate in any FlexE protocols.

3.2.  FlexE Aware transport

   This scenario represents an optimization of the FlexE unaware
   transport presented in Section 3.1, and illustrated in Figure 1.  In
   this application (see Figure 2), the devices at the edge of the
   transport network do not terminate the FlexE shim layer, but are
   aware of the (a) composition of the FlexE group (i.e. set of all
   contained Ethernet PHYs) and (b) format of the FlexE overhead.  At
   the ingress to the transport network, the transport network edge
   removes the unavailable calendar slots, and retains all available
   calendar slots (whether they are allocated or not).  At the egress
   point of the transport network, the edge device adds the unavailable
   calendar slots back.  The result is that the FlexE Shim layers at
   both routers see exactly the same input that they saw in the FlexE
   unware scenario -- with the added benefit that the line (or DWDM)
   side bandwidth has been optimized to be sufficient to carry only the
   available calendar slots in all of the Ethernet PHY(s) in the FlexE
   group.

   The transport network edge device could learn of the set of
   unavailable calendar slots in a variety of ways; a few examples are
   listed below:

   a.  In this scenario, the transport network edge does not expect the
       number of unavailable calendar slots to change dynamically.  The
       set of unavailable calendar slots is configured against each
       Ethernet PHY in the FlexE group.  The FlexE demux function in the
       transport network edge device (A) compares the information about
       calendar slots which are expected to be unavailable (as per user
       supplied configuration), with the corresponding information
       encoded by the customer edge device in the FlexE overhead (as
       specified in [OIFFLEXE1]).  If there is a mismatch between the
       unavailable calendar slots in any of the PHYs within a FlexE
       group, the transport edge node software could raise an alarm to
       report the inconsistency between the provisioning information at
       the transport network edge, and the customer edge device.

   b.  The Transport network edge is configured to act in a "slave"
       mode.  In this mode, the FlexE demux function at the Transport
       network edge (A) receives the information about the available/
       unavailable calendar slots by observing the FlexE overhead (as
       specified in [OIFFLEXE1]) and uses this information to calculate
       the bandwidth of the ODUflex (or fixed rate ODUs) connection that
       could carry the FlexE PCS end-to-end.  This scenario allows for
       the set of available/unavailable calendar slots to change
       (slowly) with time -- but comes with the complexity of resizing
       the ODUflex connection in response to changes in the number of
       available calendar slots.

   Note that the process of removing unavailable calendar slots from a
   FlexE PHY is called "crunching" (see [OIFFLEXE1]).  The following
   additional notes apply to Figure 2:

   a.  As in the FlexE unaware case, all PHYs of the FlexE group MUST be
       terminated between the same two FlexE shims.

   b.  The crunched FlexE PHYs are independently transported through the
       transport network.  The number of used (and unused) calendar
       slots can be different across the FlexE group.  In particular, if
       all the calendar slots in a FlexE PHY are in use, the crunching
       operation leaves the original signal intact.

   c.  In this illustration, the different FlexE PHY(s) are transported
       using ODUflex containers in the transport network.  These ODUflex
       connections can be of different rates.

   d.  In the most general form, G.709 Section 17.12 [G.709] allows for
       a FlexE group consisting of m Ethernet PHY(s) to be crunched,
       combined, and transported using n ODUFlex containers (where n can
       range between 1 and m).  In other words, the ITU G.709
       recommendation allows for (but not require the support for) the
       degenerate cases in which (a) each Ethernet PHY within the group
       is transported using its own ODUflex, and (b) all the PHY(s) are
       crunched, combined and transported over a single ODUflex
       container.  If all the sub-calendar slots in a given PHY are
       available, it is possible to transport the content of the PHY in
       one of two ways: (a) as shown in Figure 2, or (b) using a FlexE
       unware (i.e.  PCS-codeword transparent transport) mode.  The
       latter approach (of using FlexE unaware transport) for a few
       select (fully-utilized) PHYs is not attractive from the
       perspective of skew between the PHYs that comprise the FlexE
       group.  For simplicity, the preferred mode of operation will be
       one in which the same mapping procedure is used for member PHYs
       of a FlexE group.

   e.  When the crunched FlexE PHY(s) have a rate that is identical to
       that of a standard Ethernet PHY, it is possible that the
       transport network may utilize standard ODU containers such as
       ODU2e, ODU4 etc.  As currently defined by ITU G.709 Section 17.12
       [G.709], the crunched signal is always mapped to an ODUflex, and
       the mapping to a fixed rate ODU signal is not required.  This
       option could be dropped if it results in any significant
       simplification.

   f.  The bandwidth of the ODUFlex connections shall be computed based
       on the total number of available 5G calendar slots which in the

       subset of PHY(s) which are transported over this ODUflex entity
       (see Section 3.2, G.709:Table 7-2 [G.709]).

   g.  As in the FlexE unaware case, the FlexE Shim layer is terminated
       at the routers, and the coordination of operations related to
       FlexE clients, e.g. creating new FlexE clients, deleting existing
       FlexE clients, and resizing the bandwidth of existing FlexE
       clients (if desired) happens between the two routers.  Note that
       the transport network is completely transparent to the FlexE
       signals, and doesn't participate in any FlexE protocols.  As long
       as the set of available (and unavailable) calendar slots on the
       PHY(s) does not change after the initial setup, the transport
       network is not required to make any changes to the number/rates
       of ODUflex connections which were created at service setup time.

   h.  In the FlexE aware case, the OTN pipes are sized to match the
       currently configured set of available/unavailable calendar slots
       across the FlexE group.  If this set of available/unavailable
       calendar slots on the PHY(s) is allowed to dynamically change,
       the ODUflex connections would also require resizing to match the
       new usage of available slots.  However, the ODUflex hitless
       resizing mechanism defined in G.7044 [G7044] has the following
       restrictions: (a) ODUflex connection being resized must have
       bandwidth of 100G or less (b) the ODUflex connection cannot
       traverse OTUCn links which were introduced in the latest revision
       of G.709.  With the present limitations in the ODUflex resizing
       mechanism, the dynamic adjustent of ODUflex bandwidth (for the
       FlexE aware case) is possible only if (a) the transport network
       edge maps each crunched PHY to its own ODUflex connection (b) the
       Ethernet PHY rates are 100G or less (c) the ODUflex connection
       does not traverse any OTUCn links along the end-to-end path.  As
       a result, this scenario is not considered in this document.

3.3.  FlexE Termination in Transport

   These usecases build upon the basic router-transport equipment
   connectivity illustrated in Figure 1.  The FlexE shim layer at the
   router maps to the set of FlexE clients over the FlexE group, as
   usual.  This section considers various usecases in which the
   equipment located at the edge of the transport network instantiates
   the FlexE Shim function which peers with the FlexE shim on the
   customer device.  In the router to network direction, the transport
   edge node terminates the FlexE shim layer, and extracts one or more
   FlexE client signals, and transports them through the network.  That
   is, these usecases are distinguished from the FlexE unaware cases in
   that the FlexE group, and the FlexE shim layer end at the transport
   network edge, and only the extracted FlexE client signals transit the
   optical network.  In the network to router direction, the transport
   edge node maps a set of FlexE clients to the FlexE group (i.e.
   performing the same functions as the router which connects to the
   transport network).The various usecases differ in the combination of
   service endpoints in the transport network.  In the FlexE termination
   scenarios, the distance between the FlexE Shims is limited the normal
   Ethernet link distance.  The FlexE shims in the router, and the
   equipment need to support a small amount skew.

3.3.1.  FlexE Client at Both endpoints

   In this scenario, service consists of transporting a FlexE client
   through the transport network, and possibly combining this FlexE
   client with other FlexE clients into a FlexE group at the endpoints.
   The FlexE client signal BMP mapped into an ODUflex (of the
   appropriate rate) and then switched across the OTN.  Figure 3
   illustrates the scenario involving the mapping of a FlexE client to
   an ODUflex envelope; this figure only shows the signal "stack" at the
   service endpoints, and doesn't illustrate the switching of the
   ODUflex entity through the OTN.  The ODUflex signal then carried over
   a sequence of OTUk links (with a maximum rate of 100G), and/or OTUCn
   (with rates of n X 100G).  Although Figure 3 illustrates the scenario
   in which one FlexE client is transported within the OTN, the
   following points should be noted:

   a.  When the FlexE Shim termination function recovers multiple FlexE
       client signals (at node A), the FlexE signals can be transported
       independently.  In other words, it is not a requirement that all
       the FlexE client signals be co-routed.

   b.  Conversely, at the egress node, FlexE clients from different
       endpoints can be combined via the FlexE shim, eventually exiting
       the transport edge node over an Ethernet group.

Internet-Draft              FlexE Extensions                  March 2017


   c.  The description presented above(implicitly) assumes that the
       FlexE Client signals have a constant bit rate which does not
       change after the service setup.  In the scenarios in which the
       FlexE Client Signal rates are permitted to be dynamically
       adjusted (i.e. resized), the resizing process would require
       coordination across three resizing domains: (a) between Router1,
       Node A (b) Resizing the ODUflex connection between the transport
       edge nodes A, Z (c) between the Node Z, Router2.  This usecase is
       not considered in this document since G.709 [G.709] has dropped
       support for the the hitless resizing of ODUflex connections with
       bandwidths larger than 100G.  In the absence of a hitless B100G
       ODUflex resizing mechanism, this will have to be realized by
       treating it like a request for new service with a new (increased
       or decreased) rate.  The FlexE client bandwidth resize
       applicability for various use cases is summarized in Table 1.

3.3.2.  Interworking of FlexE Client w/ Native Client at the other
        endpoint

   The OIF implementation agreement [OIFFLEXE1] currently supports FlexE
   client signals carried over one or more 100GBASE-R PHY(s).  There is
   a calendar of 5G timeslots associated with each PHY, and each FlexE
   client can make use of a number of timeslots (possibly distributed
   across the members of the FlexE group).  This implies that the FlexE
   client rates are multiples of 5Gbps.  When the rates of the FlexE
   client signals matches the MAC rates corresponding to existing
   Ethernet PHYs, i.e. 10GBASE-R/40GBASE-R/100GBASE-R, there is a need
   for the FlexE client signal to interwork with the native Ethernet
   client received from a single (non-FlexE capable) Ethernet PHY.  This
   capability is expected to be extended to any future Ethernet PHY
   rates that the IEEE may define in future (e.g. 25G, 50G, 200G etc.).
   In these cases, although the bit rate of the FlexE client matches the
   MAC rate of other endpoint, the 64B66B PCS codewords for the FlexE
   client need to be transformed (via ordered set translation) to match
   the specification for the specific Ethernt PHY.  These details are
   described in Section 7.2.2 of [OIFFLEXE1] and are not eloborated any
   further in this document.

   Figure 4 illustrates a scenario involving the interworking of a 10G
   FlexE client with a 10GBASE-R native Ethernet signal.  In this
   example, the network wrapper is ODU2e.

3.3.3.  Interworking of FlexE client w/ Client from OIF_MLG

   As explained in the Introduction section ( Section 1 OIFMLG3
   [OIFMLG3] introduced support for carrying 10GE and 40GE client
   signals over a group of 100GBASE-R Ethernet PHY(s).  While the most
   recent implementation agreement doesn't call it out explicitly, it is
   expected that the FlexE clients (as defined in [OIFFLEXE1]), and
   10GBASE-R/40GBASE-R clients supported by OIFMLG3 [OIFMLG3]) will
   interoperate.

   Figure 5 illustrates a scenario involving the interworking of a 10G
   FlexE client with a 10GBASE-R client supported by an OIFMLG3
   interface.  In this example, the network wrapper is ODU2e.

3.4.  Back-to-Back FlexE

   This section covers a degenerate FlexE termination scenario in which
   Router1, Router2, and Router3 are interconnected through back-to-back
   FlexE groups without an intermediate transport network (see
   Figure 6).  Even in scenarios where there is a transport network
   providing FlexE unaware/aware transport services for this pair of
   FlexE groups, the FlexE layer network can be viewed as an overlay on
   top of the underlying transport network.  As such, all of the FlexE
   Shim operations (e.g. adding/deleting FlexE clients, resizing
   existing clients) proceed in the same manner -- regardless of whether
   the routers are directly connected or not.

   In this example, the FlexE Shim at Router2 extracts one or more FlexE
   client signals from the FlexE group connected to Router1, and
   mutliplexes these extracted FlexE signals into the FlexE group

   towards the appropriate router (e.g.  Router3).  Note that each of
   the extracted FlexE client signals can be independently routed
   towards its respective FlexE group.

3.5.  FlexE Client BW Resizing

   The hop-by-hop (a hop is delimited by two FlexE Shim functions)
   resizing of a FlexE client signal operates by maintaining two sets of
   calendar slots for each client: the present and the future.  Once the
   configuration of both calendar slots for a specific client is
   complete, the node signals to its peer to switch to from the present
   set to the new set of calendar slots.  Note that the switch to the
   new set of calendar slots is unidirectional, and the process is
   executed independently for both directions of transfer.  This process
   makes use of the following FlexE overhead (as per [OIFFLEXE1]

   a.  Currently active FlexE calendar (containing a list of mapping
       between the 5G tributary slots and the FlexE client signals

   b.  Future calendar to which the sender wants to transition to.

   c.  Calendar switch request bit (CR)

   d.  Calendar switch acknowldege bit (CA)

   FlexE client resizing operations are supported and can be achieved
   via the configuration of Calendar A and Calendar B.  It is worth
   noting that there is no guarantee that such resizing will be hitless.

4.  Requirements

   This section summarizes the requirements for FlexE Group and FlexE
   Client signaling and routing.  The requirements are derived from the
   usecases described in Section 3 of this document.  Data plane
   requirements (and/or solutions) (e.g. crunching of tributary slots,
   adding unavailable tributary slots etc.) are not explicitly mentioned
   in the following text.  Given that the control plane sets up circuits
   that transport client streams, there are no implications for the
   control plane in matters of delay, jitter tolerance etc.  The
   requirements listed in this section will be used to identify the
   Control Plane (i.e.  Routing and Signaling) extensions that will be
   required to support FlexE services in an OTN.

   A Control Plane solution will be compliant to the specification in
   Section 7 if it meets all the mandatory (MUST, SHALL) requirments,
   the solution may also meet the optional (SHOULD, MAY) requirments.

   Req-1   The solution SHALL support the creation of a FlexE group,
           consisting of one or more (i.e., in the 1 to 254 range) 100GE
           Ethernet PHY(s).

           There are several alternatives that can meet this
           requirement, e.g. routing and signaling protocols, or a
           centrailized controller/management system with network access
           to the FlexE mux/demux at each FlexE group termination point.

Internet-Draft              FlexE Extensions                  March 2017


   Req-2   The solution SHOULD be able to verify that the collection of
           Ethernet PHY(s) included in a FlexE group have the same
           characteristics (e.g. number of PHYs, rate of PHYs, etc.) at
           the peer FlexE shims.

   Req-3   The solution SHALL support the ability to delete a FlexE
           group.

   Req-4   It SHALL support the ability to administratively lock/unlock
           a FlexE group.

   Req-5   It SHALL be possible to add/remove PHY(s) to/from an
           operational FlexE group while the group has been
           administratively locked.

           [Note: Since the addition/removal of Ethernet PHY(s) is done
           only when the group has been locked, this dataplane operation
           of the FlexE group ceases until it is placed in an unlocked
           state.]

   Req-6   The solution SHALL support the ability to advertise (and
           discover) the information about FlexE capable nodes, and the
           FlexE group instances they are supporting.

   Req-7   It SHALL be possible to assign the transport network
           treatment for a FlexE group to one the following choices: (a)
           FlexE unaware transport (b) FlexE aware transport (c) FlexE
           termination in Transport.

   Req-8   For the FlexE unaware case, each of the Ethernet PHY(s) in
           the FlexE group SHALL be mapped independently to the
           appropriately sized ODU container (as per [G.709], and
           switched across the transport network [OIFFLEXE1].  The
           control plane SHALL be capable of co-routing the ODU signals
           that are transporting the member PHY(s) between the two FlexE
           Shim functions.

           [Note: Insert applicable references to ITU, OIF spec for hard
           skew tolerances]

   Req-9   In the FlexE aware mode, the OTN SHALL crunch the PHY(s), and
           map them to one or more ODUflex connections as per [G.709].

           When two or more ODUflex connections are used to transport
           the collection of FlexE PHY(s) in a FlexE group, the system
           SHALL support the ability to constrain the routes for these
           ODUflex connections (e.g. co-route them) so that the end-to-

Internet-Draft              FlexE Extensions                  March 2017


           end skew is kept to a minimum (and within the range supported
           by the FlexE Shims).

   Req-10  The system SHALL allow the addition (or removal) of one or
           more FlexE clients against the FlexE group which is being
           terminated.  The addition (or removal) of FlexE client SHALL
           not affect the services for the other FlexE client signals.

   Req-11  The system SHALL allow the FlexE client signals to flexibly
           span the set of Ethernet PHY(s) which comprise the FlexE
           group.  In other words, it SHALL be possible to distribute
           any FlexE client over an arbitrary combination of calendar
           slots (whose total capacity matches the client bitrate)
           chosen from a subset of the PHY(s).

   Req-12  When the FlexE group is terminated on the Transport edge
           node, this node SHOULD be capable of resizing one or more
           FlexE client (using the "A/B" calendar signaling defined by
           OIF) (see Section 3.5).  It is acceptable that this resizing
           is not hitless, and the client signal incurs a glitch during
           the resizing operation.

           There is no requirement for the OTN network to support the
           hitless resizing of the ODUFlex connection which is
           transporting the FlexE client signal.

   Req-13  The solution SHALL support FlexE client resizing without
           affecting any existing FlexE clients within the same FlexE
           group.

5.  Framework

   This section discusses the environment where FlexE operates, this
   should include both what FlexE runs over and what applications run on
   top of FlexE.

5.1.  FlexE Layer Model

   Based on the cases addressed in Section 3, FlexE has different kinds
   of mapping hierarchy accordingly.  This section gives some
   description of FlexE layer model in different cases.

5.1.1.  Layer Model in FlexE Unaware Case

   This case is depicted in Section 3.1.  The FlexE Ethernet client
   represents an end-to-end connection, which is from the Router 1 to
   destination Router 2.  The FlexE Ethernet client signal is first
   mapped into the slots of FlexE at Router 1, then the FlexE signal is



Hussain, et al.        Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft              FlexE Extensions                  March 2017


   carried by Ethernet PHYs towards the destination Router 2.  When the
   Ethernet PHYs arrive at Transport network edge node A-end, each PHY
   will be mapped into a separate ODU4 connection and then forwarded
   across the OTN network towards the ODU layer connection destination
   Z-end.

   Note: in this case, more than one FlexE clients can be carried by
   FlexE layer.

   Four different layers exist in this case, and the mapping hierarchy
   can be seen in Figure 1.

5.1.2.  Layer Model in FlexE Terminating Case

   This case is depicted in Section 3.3.  Take Section 3.3.1 for
   example.  The FlexE Ethernet signal is first mapped into the slots of
   FlexE at Router 1, then the FlexE signal is carried by Ethernet PHYs
   towards the Transport Network edge node A-end.  When the FlexE signal
   arrives at node A-end, node A-end first terminate Ethernet PHY signal
   and FlexE signal, extracts the FlexE Ethernet client signal, then
   maps the Ethernet client signal into ODU signal and forwards across
   the OTN network towards destination node Z-end.  Node Z-end first
   terminate the ODU signal, extract the FlexE client signal from the
   ODU signal, then map the Ethernet client signal into FlexE signal,
   which will then be carried by Ethernet PHYs towards destination node
   Router 2.

   Two segments of FlexE connection exist in this case. one is from
   Router 1 to node A-end, and the other is from node Z-end to Router 2.
   The mapping hierarchy can be seen in Figure 3

5.1.3.  Layer Model in FlexE Aware Case

   This case is depicted in Section 3.2.  The FlexE Ethernet client is
   transferred from the R1 to destination R2, while the internal node NE
   A and NE Z are capable of "crunching" and "combining" operation.  The
   FlexE Ethernet client signal is first mapped into the slots of FlexE
   at R1, then the FlexE signal is carried by Ethernet PHYs towards the
   destination R2.  When the Ethernet PHY signal arrives at node NE A,
   node NE A first discards unavailable slots, then map the remaining
   FlexE slots onto ODU Connection.  According to the description in
   [G.709], these FlexE slots can be carried across the OTN network via
   a couple of ODUflex signals which are carried in ODUCn/OTUCn/OTSiA
   signals.

   Two kinds of mapping hierarchy exist in this case, one is the FlexE
   connection is carried by Ethernet PHYs, the other is FlexE connection

   (e.g., FlexE-psg) is carried by ODUflex, which can be seen in
   Figure 2.

5.2.  GMPLS Considerations

   The goal of this section is to provide an insight into the
   application of GMPLS as a control mechanism in FlexE networks.
   Specific control-plane requirements for the support of FlexE networks
   are covered in Section 5.3.  This section aims to describe the
   modelling of controlling the FlexE shim layer specific attributes in
   different network scenarios based on the capability of FlexE
   described in OIF Flex Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement
   [OIFFLEXE1].

5.2.1.  General Considerations

   The GMPLS control of the FlexE layer deals with the establishment of
   FlexE connections that are transferred in FlexE capable nodes.  GMPLS
   labels are used to locally represent the FlexE connections and its
   associated slots assignment information for client.

5.2.2.  Consideration of FlexE LSPs

   The FlexE LSP is a control-plane representation of a FlexE Connection
   and MUST be carried by Ethernet PHYs LSP or ODU LSP in the network.

   Figure 1 depicts a scenario that the FlexE LSP is carried over
   Ethernet PHYs LSP from Router 1 to Router 2.  When there is a need to
   set up FlexE end-to-end connection to carry FlexE Ethernet client
   signal at R1, R1 will first check if there are enough resources for
   setting up FlexE LSP.  If yes, R1 will first set up Ethernet PHYs LSP
   from R1 to R2, and then set up the FlexE LSP over the Ethernet PHYs
   LSP.  This process actually includes three signalling procedures, the
   first one is to set up multiple ODU4 LSPs to carry Ethernet PHYs, the
   second one is to set up multiple Ethernet PHYs connection to carry
   FlexE LSP, and the third one is to set up FlexE connection to carry
   FlexE Ethernet client signal.  The signalling of FlexE LSP SHOULD be
   able to reserve resource for Ethernet client.

   Figure 2 depicts the case that the FlexE LSP is carried over ODU LSP
   between NE A and NE Z.  This case is different from that one in
   Figure 1, and is used to support cases such as the Ethernet PHY rate
   is be greater than the wavelength rate, the wavelength rate is not an
   integral multiple of the PHY rate.  Both NE A and NE Z support the
   partial-rate ability ,which means when the FlexE LSP over Ethernet
   PHYs arrives at NE A, NE A should first discard the unavailable slots
   and then map the remaining FlexE slots into the ODU signal.

5.2.3.  Control-Plane Modelling of FlexE Network Elements

   FlexE is a new kinds of transport technology, which has many new
   constraints.  These constraints are listed as follows:

      Unavailable slots: this is different from "unused" slot, in that
      it is known, due to transport network constraints, that not all of
      the calendar slots generated from the FlexE mux will reach the
      FlexE demux and therefore no FlexE client should be assigned to
      those slots.  As defined in the Flex Ethernet Implementation
      Agreement, unavailable slots are always at the end of the sub-
      calendar configuration for the respective PHY.

      Unused slots: unused slots can be allocated to Ethernet client as
      available resource.

      Partial-rate capability: the partial-rate capability is usually
      supported by the OTN edge equipments.  If an equipment supports
      partial-rate, it means this equipment has the capability of
      discarding unavailable slots and transfers the remaining slots
      across OTN transport network.

      Slot granularity: currently, only one kinds of 5G slot granularity
      is defined in OIF Flex Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement.

5.2.4.  FlexE Layer Resource Allocation Considerations

   FlexE LSP is used to provide resource service for its client, which
   is mainly reflected through the provision of the unused slot resource
   information towards the client layer.  Besides the slot information,
   there are also some other attributes that need to be specified when
   allocating resource during connection setup process.

      FlexE group number: a bunch of Ethernet PHYs can be bounded
      together and used as a whole as one FlexE LSP.  FlexE LSPs between
      the same source and destination equipment SHOULD NOT have the same
      FlexE group number.  Source equipment and destination equipment
      SHOULD be aware of the existing of different FlexE groups and
      which Ethernet PHYs are in which FlexE group.

      PHY Number: it's a dynamic and logical number that is assigned
      through control plane or management plane, which is unique within
      the context of (source, destination), and has a one-to-one
      correlation with physical port.  This information will also be
      carried in the FlexE overhead.  Source equipment and destination
      equipment SHOULD negotiate a value for every Ethernet PHYs within
      one FlexE group.

      Slot Assignment information: the FlexE LSP transfers based on the
      slot positions, so the equipment SHOULD be able to tell which slot
      is assigned to which client.

      Partial-rate: during the process of resource allocation, where the
      partial-rate would happen should be indicated.

      Granularity: currently, only one kinds of 5G slot granularity is
      defined in OIF Flex Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement
      [FlexE-IA].

5.2.5.  Neighbour Discovery and Link Property Correlation

   There are potential interworking problems between different FlexE
   capable equipment.  Devices or equipments might not be able to
   support the interworking of every slot due to the constraints of
   transport network equipment or other constraints.  In this case, two
   directly connected FlexE capable equipments SHOULD run the neighbour
   discovery process and correlate the link property to make sure which
   slots are unavailable, which slots can be used by the client.
   Neighbour discovery protocol can be communicated in in-band FlexE
   section management channel, and also can be communicated through out-
   of-band management channel.

5.2.6.  Routing and Topology Dissemination

   The topology and routing information is used by the path computation
   entity to compute an end-to-end path.  Besides the basic
   interconnected information, there are also some FlexE specific
   attributes that should be taken into consideration.

      Partial-rate: partial-rate capability is a special feature which
      allows an equipment to discard unavailable slots and transfers the
      left slots across OTN transport network.  Path computation entity
      is more likely to compute a feasible path if this capability is
      taken into consideration when computing path.

      Unavailable slot information: this information is used to indicate
      certain slots SHOULD not be considered when computing an end-to-
      end path.  The unavailable slots can not be used to forward signal
      because of the transport constraints.

      Unused slot information: unused slot can be allocated to the path
      as available resource.

5.3.  Control-Plane Protocol Requirements

   The control of FlexE networks brings some new additional requirements
   to the GMPLS protocols.  This section summarizes those requirements
   for signalling,routing and Link management protocol.

5.3.1.  Support for Signalling of FlexE

   Aim of the signaling is to set up an end-to-end LSP for FlexE signal.

   The signalling procedures shall be able to assign FlexE releated
   attributes for an LSP, which include FlexE group number for a FlexE
   LSP.  This FlexE group number is unique and can be used to indicate a
   group of Ethernet PHYs bonded together.

   The signalling procedures shall be able to assign an unique PHY
   number for each bonded Ethernet PHY, and a correlation relationship
   SHOULD also be indicated between the assigned PHY number and real
   physical port number when signalling.

   The signalling procedures shall be able to configure the slots
   information allocated for a FlexE LSP.

   The Signalling procedures shall be able to indicate the palace where
   partial-rate mapping happens.

   The Signalling procedures shall be able to support the non-hitless
   resizing of FlexE client.

5.3.2.  Support for Routing of FlexE

   The routing protocol extensions are mainly based on the functionality
   that is described in [RFC4202] and these extensions are made to fit
   into FlexE network.

   The routing protocol SHALL distribute sufficient information to
   compute paths to enable the signalling procedure to establish LSPs as
   described in the previous sections.

   The routing protocol SHALL update its advertisements of available
   resources and capabilities to include the partial-rate support
   information and unused slot information on each Ethernet PHY port.

5.3.3.  Support for Neighbour Discovery and Link Property and Link
        Correlation

   The control plane MAY include support for neighbour discovery such
   that a FlexE network can be constructed in a "plug-and-play" manner.

   The control plane SHOULD allow the nodes at opposite ends of a link
   to correlate the properties that they will apply to the link.  Such a
   correlation SHOULD include at least the identities of the nodes and
   the identities that they apply to the link.  Other FlexE specific
   properties, such as the link characteristics of unavailable slot
   information, SHOULD also be correlated.  Such neighbour discovery and
   link property correlation, if provided, MUST be able to operate in
   both in-band and out-of-band manner.

6.  Architecture

   This section discusses the different parts of FlexE signaling and
   routing and how these parts interoperte.

   FlexE control plane technology SHOULD be able to set up end-to-end
   connection in different cases, which may include the management of
   FlexE group, assignment of the resource to the FlexE client and so
   on.

   The FlexE routing mechanism is used to provide resource available
   information for set up FlexE connections, like Ethernet PHYs'
   information, partial-rate support information.  Based on the resource
   available information advertised by routing protocol, an end-to-end
   FlexE connection is computed, and then the signalling protocol is
   used to set up an end-to-end connection.
