        Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) Extension Fields
                  draft-stenn-ntp-extension-fields-00

Abstract

   Network Time Protocol version 4 (NTPv4) defines the optional usage of
   extension fields.  An extension field, as defined in RFC 5905
   [RFC5905], resides after the end of the NTP header, and supplies
   optional capabilities or information that is not conveyed in the
   standard NTP header.  This document updates RFC 5905 [RFC5905] by
   clarifying some points regarding NTP extension fields and their usage
   with legacy Message Authentication Codes (MACs).

   With the adoption of this update, the authors recommend rescinding
   [Err3627].

1.  Introduction

   The NTP header format consists of a set of fixed fields that may be
   followed by optional fields.  Two types of optional fields are
   defined: extension fields as defined in Section 7.5 of RFC 5905
   [RFC5905], and legacy Message Authentication Codes (legacy MACs).

   If a legacy MAC is used, it resides at the end of the packet.  This
   field can be either a 4-octet crypto-NAK or data that is usually 20
   or 24 octets long.

   NTP extension fields are defined in RFC 5905 [RFC5905] as a generic
   mechanism that allows the addition of future extensions and features
   without modifying the NTP header format (Section 16 of RFC 5905
   [RFC5905]).

   Section 7.5 of RFC 5905 [RFC5905] clearly states that "one or more
   extension fields can be inserted after the header and before the MAC,
   which is always present when an extension field is present."
   However, the experimental Checksum Complement RFC 7821 [RFC7821]
   cannot be used if the NTP packet contains a MAC.

   To allow for extension fields that do not require a MAC, changes to
   the NTPv4 specification must be made.  [Err3627] was an attempt to

   clarify the rules around MACs, but with the adoption of this proposal
   the authors recommend rescinding [Err3627].

   This document better specifies and clarifies both Extention Fields
   and the requirements and parsing of a legacy MAC, with changes to
   address errors found after the publication of RFC 5905 [RFC5905] with
   respect to extension fields.  Specifically, this document updates
   Section 7.5 of RFC 5905 [RFC5905], clarifying the relationship
   between extension fields and MACs, and defines the behavior of a host
   that receives an unknown extension field.

3.1.  OLD: 7.5 NTP Extension Field Format

   In NTPv4, one or more extension fields can be inserted after the
   header and before the MAC, which is always present when an extension
   field is present.  Other than defining the field format, this
   document makes no use of the field contents.  An extension field
   contains a request or response message in the format shown in
   Figure 14.

   All extension fields are zero-padded to a word (four octets)
   boundary.  The Field Type field is specific to the defined function
   and is not elaborated here.  While the minimum field length
   containing required fields is four words (16 octets), a maximum field
   length remains to be established.

   The Length field is a 16-bit unsigned integer that indicates the
   length of the entire extension field in octets, including the Padding
   field.

3.2.  NEW: 7.5 NTP Extension Field Format

   In NTPv4, one or more extension fields can be inserted after the
   header and before the possibly optional legacy MAC.  A MAC SHOULD be
   present when an extension field is present.  A MAC is always present
   in some form when NTP packets are authenticated.  This MAC can be
   either a legacy MAC or a MAC-EF.  Other than defining the field
   format, this document makes no use of the field contents.  An
   extension field contains a request or response message in the format
   shown in Figure 14.

   Where:

      R: 0 for a "Query", 1 for a "Response"

      E: 0 for "OK", 1 for an "Error"

      O: 0 for "MAC Required", 1 for "MAC Optional"

      I: 0 for "MAC Not Included", 1 for "MAC Included"

   The Code subtype is currently only used by RFC 5906, Autokey
   [RFC5906].

   The Field Type, Value, and Padding fields are specific to the defined
   function and are not elaborated here; the Field Type value is defined
   in an IANA registry, and the Length, Value, and Padding values are
   defined by the document referred to by the registry.  If a host
   receives an extension field with an unknown Field Type, the host
   SHOULD ignore the extension field and MAY drop the packet altogether
   if policy requires it.

   While the minimum field length containing required fields is four
   words (16 octets), the maximum field length MUST NOT be longer than
   65532 octets due to the maximum size of the data represented by the
   Length field, and SHOULD be small enough that the size of the NTP
   packet received by the client does not exceed the smallest MTU
   between the sender and the recipient.

   The Length field is a 16-bit unsigned integer that indicates the
   length of the entire extension field in octets, including any Padding
   .

3.3.  NEW: 7.5.1 Extension Fields and MACs

   With the inclusion of additional Extension Fields, there is now a
   possibility of an ambiguous parsing of a legacy MAC.  If an
   implementation offers even a modicum of care, there will be no
   ambiguity when parsing an NTP packet that contains a legacy MAC.

   If an implementation uses the LAST-EF extension field, the presence
   of this field means "I am the last EF in this NTP Packet.  Any
   subsequent packet data MUST be a legacy MAC."  In this case, there is
   no parsing ambiguity.

   If a system sends its MAC as a MAC-EF and does not send a legacy MAC,
   there is no parsing ambiguity.

   The only time there is a potential for a parsing ambiguity is when a
   legacy MAC is provided and neither of the previous two cases are
   present.  Even in this case, there is minimal risk.

   An Extension Field contains a 2-octet Field Type, a 2-octet Field
   Length, and any payload (data and/or padding).  If the NTP Packet
   parsing is at a point where it is evaluating data after the base
   packet, one of the following situations exists:

      If the Field Length is not an even multiple of 4, we are not
      looking at an extension field.  In this case, the only possibility
      of having a valid packet is if the data is part of a legacy MAC.

      If the Field Length is valid, i.e., an even multiple of 4 octets,
      one of the following three cases must be present:

         First, the Field Length will be less than the remaining data.
         This means subsequent data must parse as some number of
         Extension Fields, optionally follwed by a legacy MAC.

         Second, the Field Length will exactly match the remaining data.

         The third case is where the Field Length is longer than the
         remaining packet data.  In this case, the current parse cannot
         be a valid extension field.

   Semantic checking may also be done to validate a potential legacy
   MAC.  A legacy MAC is a four-octet Key Identifier followed by a
   message digest.  The usual message digest is 16 octets long but may



Mizrahi, et al.           Expires May 17, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           NTPv4 Extension Fields            November 2016


   be another size, depending on the digest algorithm.  In the Reference
   Implementation, a Key Identifier between 1 and 65535, inclusive, is a
   symmetric key, while a Key Identifier that is > 65535 is an Autokey
   RFC 5905 [RFC5905], or similar.  If the receiving system does not
   recognize the Key Identifier, the data CANNOT be a valid legacy MAC.
   If the receiving system recognizes the Key Identifier, then it also
   has knowledge of the digest algorithm and can make sure the digest
   payload is the proper length.  If this is not the case, then the data
   CANNOT be a valid legacy MAC.

   It is trivial to parse the data after the base NTP packet and come up
   with a list of potential parsings.  A local policy choice can specify
   the precedence of the parsing options in this case.

   If none of the parsings validate, the packet fails authentication.
   An implementation has three local policy choices available if LAST-EF
   is not used and a legacy MAC may be provided.  First, the
   implementation may specify EF-precedence.  Second, the implementation
   may specify legacy-MAC-precedence.  Finally, the implementation may
   specify "best fit" precedence.  In this last case, the packet will
   meet one of the three following criteria: First, none of the parsings
   will match.  Again, this is a case of failed authentication.  Second,
   exactly one parsing will match and that parsing will be accepted.
   Third, multiple parsings will match, in which case the implementation
   may choose its behavior.

   Additionally, most EFs will require a MAC.  If there is a
   syntactically-valid parsing that does not include a MAC but
   previously scanned EFs require a MAC, then in a multiple-choice
   parsing scenario where one of the choices does not include a MAC the
   "no MAC provided" choice SHOULD be eliminated.

   Note well that this rare situation can be completely avoided by using
   LAST-EF, or by indicating that no legacy MAC will be used.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests IANA to allocate NTP Extension Field Types 0x0007
   (I-Do), 0x2007 (I-Do, MAC OPTIONAL), 0x8007 (I-Do Response), and
   0xA007 (I-Do Response, MAC OPTIONAL)for this proposal.

5.  Security Considerations

   Additional information TBD
