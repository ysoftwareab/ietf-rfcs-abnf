1.  Overview

   The new services' provider expects a user experience with lower
   latency and high reliability, which put forwards immense challenges
   to cloud computing and traditional network.  Centralized computing
   requires a long transmission distance of traffic flow, and the
   existing network technology is to the best of its ability.  Network
   operators start to think about how to meet the higher needs of
   service provider and users.  Computing in the network may solve the

   problems because it can provide a flexible network and computing
   integration system.

   To integrate the computing resource to the network, it need to find
   suitable computing nodes to handle service's request, as well as a
   forwarding path to them.  How much computing resources will affect
   the delay of service processing, which could also affect the whole
   network latency.  Just as the measurement of network performance has
   one more dimension, it will interact and cooperate with others.  So
   there are some requirments for both network and computing.

2.  Requirements of Network

   The network requirements includes precision, concurrent, addressing
   and information interaction.

2.1.  Precision

   Precision of the network refers to the deterministic of latency,
   packet loss rate and perception of computing resources.

   * Latency: The traditional network's best-effort forwarding mode can
   no longer meet the demand of such services for network latency.  The
   deterministic latency brings forward a new measure latitude for
   network, which changes from in-time to on-time.

   * Packet loss rate: It is another factor to evaluate the precision of
   the network.  Utilizing the ubiquitous computing capability of the
   network, network prediction and segment-by-segment path
   retransmitting are realized based on AI, network transmission can be
   optimized and service QoS can be ensured.

   * Perception of computing resources: how to precisely obtain the
   status of computing resource to meet the requirements of business
   requests is also a challenge to the network.  It considers the
   network status and the performance status of computing resources can
   be matched dynamicly.  So the user experience, utilization rate of
   computing resources and the network efficiency can be optimum.

   For the latency and packet loss rate, some technologies such as time-
   sensitive network TSN, deterministic network DetNet, etc., have
   proposed corresponding technical means to provide network bearers
   with deterministic latency(IEEE802.1Qbv, IEEE802.1Qbu) and packet
   loss rate and guarantee the user's business experience.  However, it
   also needs to consider how to guarantee the service's end-to-end
   latency, packet loss rate and resource utilization rate.

   For the perception of computing resources, we may consider about the
   OAM and telemetry to achieve it, however, the performance and
   information collection strategies are issues that need attention.

2.2.  Concurrent

   There will be number of computing nodes deployed in the network, or
   computing fucntions intergrated in the network device for network
   computing.  A serivce's computing request may distributed in several
   computing nodes in order to response quickly to the client.  So there
   may be a lot of parallel computing task, whitch cause too much
   connection among the nodes but consume less bandwidth.  It will bring
   great challenges to the concurrent network connection including how
   to build and deploy these distributed computing nodes to ensure the
   processing capability of the network , as well as the storage, call
   of the database are worth studying.

2.3.  Addressing

   Traditional application-based addressing can not accurately grasp the
   network performance in real time.  The comprehensive performance of
   addressing results based on application layer may not be the best.
   It is always to find the consistent host's address and go through a
   long distance internet, which results in poor business experience.

   It need to find some new way to improve the addressing proccess.  For
   example, in the function based addressing, the application
   deconstruction components on the server side are distributed on the
   cloud platform, and the business logic in the server is transferred
   to the client side.  So the client only needs to care about the
   computing function itself, not about the computing resources such as
   server, virtual machine, container and so on.

2.4.  Information interaction

   The network needs to have the ability to sense application's
   requirments and expose network and computing status.  For example,
   application can tell the network requirements including bandwidth,
   latency and jitter, as well as the computing requirements, such as
   CPU, storage and memory.  The network also can have the capability to
   be aware of the application's requirements.  Thus it can effectively
   support the network programming, which could meet the future business
   requirements.

3.  Requirements of computing

   The computing requirements includes computing resource deployment,
   discovery, reservation, scheduling and OAM.

3.1.  Computing resource deployment

   If some computing tasks in the network is planned to be implemented,
   it needs to consider about what kinds of chips and where should them
   be deployed.  On the one hands, different kinds of computing require
   different kinds of chips, such as CPU, GPU and memory chip.  On the
   other hands, those chips may be put into router, switch, server or
   some dedicated machines, which are connected by the network.

   There is an example about AI algorithm which might be discussed
   before.  The AI algorithm has several steps including training and
   matching, and they also have different requirements of chips.  In
   network computing, those steps could be distributed in different
   computing nodes.

3.2.  Computing resource discovery

   The network needs to have the ability to discover computing
   resources. when the computing nodes are deployed in the network, it
   need to be registered to the network management system, and the
   information of computing resource or routing can update.  In this
   way, when there are computing tasks to be executed, the network can
   reasonably allocate resources according to the needs of the
   application.

3.3.  Computing resource reservation

   There might be serial distributed computing model of computing in the
   network, and different resources need to be reserved for different
   nodes.  For example, AI algorithm now has a model of step-by-step
   iteration at multiple nodes.  The previous iteration will affect the
   next calculation results, and the computing resources required for
   each iteration are not the same.  From the perspective of network
   standard, we hope to regard computing resources as the dimensions to
   measure network performance, such as the same bandwidth, path, etc.,
   while the traditional technologies of resource reservation have not
   considered the reservation of computing resources, and have not
   considered the differentiated resource reservation model.  Therefore,
   new protocol or extension of existing protocol is needed to meet the
   requirement.

3.4.  Computing aware scheduling

   Computing in network needs a reasonable scheduling strategy, which
   means computing aware scheduling.  According to the business
   requests, dynamicly computing power matching is carried out based on
   network status and performance of computing resources to achieve
   optimal user experience, optimal utilization of computing resources
   and optimal network efficiency.  In computing aware scheduling,
   computing is seen as "link state" and the computing resource
   information should be exposed.

3.5.  Computing resource OAM

   The ability of OAM can be used to continuously update the current
   computing power resources, and perform some troubleshooting tasks.
   However, OAM of computing resource is more complex than network.
   Network monitoring is relatively simple, like bandwidth, latency,
   jitter, while computing can be divided into many categories,
   different application need different kinds of computing.  So it need
   to implement fine-grained OAM of computing resource.

4.  Requirements of management

   The management requirements includes cross domain management, joint
   optimisation and multi user access.

4.1.  Cross domain management

   The computing in the network should ensure the end-to-end network
   management to meet the needs of different network topology,
   performance and function, which involves cross domain network
   arrangement.  In the process of network data transmission, different
   services will forward in different ways or different network
   protocols, and computing resources may be distributed in different
   network domains.  Effective cross domain management will enhance the
   performance of network and computing.

4.2.  Joint optimisation

   As computing resources are integrated in the network, and may be used
   as one of the measurement dimensions of network performance, joint
   optimization is also a very important part.  Network and computing
   resources will affect each other, including performance, scheduling
   and so on.  So It need a good joint optimization scheduling strategy.

4.3.  Multi user access

   Many existing applications, such as games, remote video conferencing,
   are usually multi--accessed and interacted by several users at the
   same time.  This brings about the problem of service consistency,
   that is, users accessing to the same game or video need the
   consistency of SLA, otherwise it will seriously affect the experience
   of other users.  Service consistency can be achieved through network
   management or application layer control.

5.  Conclusion

   Based on the requirements of new business, this document puts forward
   the requirements of computing in network, and gives some reference
   technologies and use cases.  Computing in network is a new direction,
   some details need more in-depth discussion and research.

6.  Security Considerations

   Computing In network has brought the trend of network convergence in
   different regions.  For example, 5g network of operators can go deep
   into the vertical industry user site to provide users with higher
   quality network services, which will bring the convergence of
   operator's network and user site network.  Besides, industrial
   Internet brings the trend of integration of industrial OT network and
   IT network to further improve the production efficiency of the
   industry.  It need to ensure the security of the network, including
   the mutual trust and non aggression of information among regions,
   which may require further protection and detection measures.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
