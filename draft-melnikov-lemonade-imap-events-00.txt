1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.


2.  Introduction

   IMAP [IDLE] extension defines how an IMAP [RFC3501] server can push
   notifications to an IMAP client.  This mechanism is suitable for
   transporting of Internet Message Store events [MSGEVENTS] "inband".
   However the [IDLE] extension doesn't provide any guidance on how
   different Message Store events can be represented in IMAP.  This
   document is attempting to fill this gap.


3.  Mapping of Internet Message Store Events to IMAP responses

   [[anchor4: Note that some event types require that the server
   supports certain IMAP extensions (e.g.  QUOTA).]]

3.1.  Message Addition and Deletion for the currently selected mailbox

   An AppendMessage or NewMessage event related to one or more messages
   in the currently selected mailbox (if any) MUST be reported as an
   EXISTS response.  The server MAY also send a RECENT response, if the
   server would mark the message as \Recent. [[anchor6: This doesn't
   provide UID of the new message.]]  If the bodyStructure parameter is
   included in the event, it MUST be returned in a FETCH response
   containing the BODYSTRUCTURE FETCH item.  If the FETCH response is
   returned it MUST contain the UID FETCH item.

   Note that a single EXISTS response can be returned for multiple
   AppendMessage/NewMessage events.

Internet-Draft        Lemonade Inband Notifications            June 2006


   Example:

            S: * 161 EXISTS
            S: * 161 FETCH (UID 25627 BODYSTRUCTURE (("TEXT" "PLAIN"
               ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)(
               "TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" "NAME"
               "trip.txt")
               "<960723163407.20117h@washington.example.com>"
               "Your trip details" "BASE64" 4554 73) "MIXED"))

   Example:

            S: * 162 EXISTS
            S: * 4 RECENT

   An ExpireMessage or ExpungeMessage event related to a message in the
   currently selected mailbox MUST be reported as an EXPUNGE response.
   [[anchor7: Recommend the EXPUNGED response?]]

   [[anchor8: OverQuota - Use OVERQUOTA response code defined in the
   expired draft-cridland-imap-quota-xx.txt.]]

   [[anchor9: UnderQuota - TBD]]

3.2.  Message Addition and Deletion for other mailboxes

   An AppendMessage/NewMessage/ExpireMessage/ExpungeMessage event
   related to one or more messages in any mailbox rather then the
   currently selected one MUST result in an untagged STATUS response,
   containing MESSAGES status data item.  Other status data items MAY be
   included. [[anchor11: What about UIDVALIDITY status item?]]

   Example:

            S: * STATUS blurdybloop (MESSAGES 231 RECENT 8
                        UIDVALIDITY 765)

   [[anchor12: OverQuota - TBD]]

   [[anchor13: UnderQuota - TBD]]

3.3.  Message Flags events for the currently selected mailbox

   All message flag events related to one or more messages in the
   currently selected mailbox (if any) MUST be reported as a FETCH
   response containing FLAGS and UID fetch items.

3.4.  Message Flags events for other mailboxes

   [[anchor16: TBD]]

3.5.  Access Accounting events

   [[anchor18: TBD]]

3.6.  Mailbox management events

   [[anchor20: These events are not currently defined in MSGEVENTS.]]

   Mailbox creation MUST be reported as a LIST response, containing
   mailbox attributes which are usually returned in a LIST response.

   Mailbox deletion MUST be reported as a LIST response, containing
   \NonExistent mailbox attribute [LISTEXT].

   Mailbox rename - TBD. [[anchor21: This would require a new LIST
   extended data item.]]


4.  Security Considerations

   [[anchor23: TBD]]


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document doesn't require any action from IANA.
