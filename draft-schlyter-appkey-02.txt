Abstract

   This document specifies a new DNS RR type for applications to store
   public keys in.  Experience with DNSSEC has indicated that mixing DNS
   keys and application keys is a bad idea in many regards.  The new RR
   expands certain fields based on experience from early DNSSEC
   deployment.

Internet-Draft       Application public keys in DNS        February 2002


1. Introduction

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) as described in
   RFC 2535 [3] specifies the KEY resource record (RR).  The KEY RR is
   specified for use both for storing keys used by the DNSSEC
   infrastructure itself and for storing keys used by non-DNSSEC
   infrastructure applications (e.g.  TLS [2], email and IPsec).  The
   issues with combining these two uses in one RR are further discussed
   in a draft called "Limiting the Scope of the KEY Resource Record"
   [10].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. Comments on the KEY RR

2.1 The flag field

   The KEY RR includes a flag field that specifies key usage, what kind
   of entity the key is associated with and various other flags.  As
   this kind of information often is application dependent and a common
   specification that covers all kinds of different flags that an
   application might need is hard to do, the usability of this field is
   questionable.

2.2 The protocol field

   The protocol field in the KEY RR is only 8-bit and thus limited to
   256 different protocols.  As there is no way of separating different
   version of a specific protocol, incompatible versions of a single
   protocol requires multiple protocol values.  A larger protocol field
   together with the possibility to specify a version of the protocol
   could solve this issue.

   A problem with multiple applications storing their public keys at a
   single owner name and thus creating a very large RR set has been
   identified.  A possible solution for this could be to use a generic
   protocol value [9] indicating that the actual protocol used is
   indicated in the owner name using a SRV-like encoding.  Although this
   would indeed solve the problem with large RR sets when querying for
   an application key, it could also make the protocol field lose its
   value in practice as new applications would not require a new
   protocol value.

3. The APPKEY resource record

   The APPKEY resource record (RR) is used to store a application public



Schlyter                 Expires August 7, 2002                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Application public keys in DNS        February 2002


   key that is associated with a Domain Name System (DNS) name.

   The RR type code for the APPKEY RR is TBA.

   An APPKEY RR is, like any other RR, authenticated by a SIG RR.

3.1 The APPKEY RDATA format

   The RDATA for an APPKEY RR consists of an algorithm number octet and
   the public key itself.  The format is as follows:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   algorithm   |                                               /
   +---------------+                public key                     /
   /                                                               /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-|

   The meaning of the APPKEY RR owner name and algorithm number octet
   are described in the sections below.  The format of the public key is
   algorithm dependent.

   APPKEY RRs do not specify their validity period but their
   authenticating SIG RR(s) do as described in RFC 2535 [3].

3.2 Algorithm number specification

   The algorithm number used is the same as defined for the KEY RR
   described in RFC 2535 [3].

3.3 Text representation of APPKEY RRs

   The RDATA portion of an APPKEY RR has the algorithm number octet
   represented as unsigned integers.

   The public key fields is represented in base 64 [8] and may be
   divided up into any number of white space separated substrings, down
   to single base 64 digits, which are concatenated to obtain the full
   public key.  These substrings can span lines using the standard
   parenthesis notation.  Note that although the public key field may
   have internal sub-fields, these do not appear in the master file
   representation.

3.4 Owner names for APPKEY RRs

   The owner name of the APPKEY RR is defined per application and SHOULD
   be defined in such a way that it is possible to query for a single

Internet-Draft       Application public keys in DNS        February 2002


   application APPKEY.  This can be, but is not limited to, the domain
   name of the host the application is running at (e.g.
   host.example.com) combined with a protocol identifier.  A name
   matching the SRV RR [5] for the service (e.g.
   _service._protocol.host.example.com) could be a good starting point
   for this naming.

4. Applicability Statement

   The APPKEY resource record (RR) are only intended for storage of
   public keys - private keys MUST NOT be stored in an APPKEY RR.

   The APPKEY RR is not intended for storage of certificates and a
   separate certificate RR, defined in RFC 2538 [4], has been developed
   for that purpose.

5. Security considerations

   Public keys from an APPKEY RR, SHOULD NOT be trusted unless the
   APPKEY was authenticated by a trusted SIG RR.  Applications that do
   not validate the signatures by themselves are advised to use TSIG [6]
   or SIG(0) [7] to protect the transport between themselves and the
   name server doing the signature validation.

6. IANA considerations

   IANA needs to allocate a RR type code for APPKEY from the standard RR
   type space.  No other IANA services are required by this document.
