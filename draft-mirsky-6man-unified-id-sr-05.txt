          Unified Identifier in IPv6 Segment Routing Networks
                   draft-mirsky-6man-unified-id-sr-05

Abstract

   Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source
   routing.  It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending
   the packet with a list of instructions, a.k.a. segments.  A segment
   can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4
   address, or IPv6 address.  Segment Routing can be applied in MPLS
   data plane by encoding segments in the MPLS label stack.  It also can
   be applied to IPv6 data plane by encoding a list of segment
   identifiers in IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH).  This
   document extends the use of the SRH to unified segment identifiers
   encoded, for example, as MPLS label or IPv4 address, to compress the
   SRH, and support more detailed network programming and interworking
   between SR-MPLS and SRv6 domains.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing architecture [RFC8402] leverages the paradigm of
   source routing.  It can be realized in a network data plane by
   prepending the packet with a list of instructions, a.k.a. segment
   identifiers (SIDs).  A segment can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.  Segment
   Routing can be applied in MPLS data plane by encoding 20-bits SIDs in
   MPLS label stack [RFC8660].  It also can be applied to IPv6 data

   Extension Header (SRH) [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].

   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] to unified identifiers encoded
   as MPLS label or IPv4 address to support more detailed network
   programming and interworking between SR-MPLS and SRv6 domains.

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Segment Routing Extension Header: Benefits and Challenges

   Many functions related to Operation, Administration and Maintenance
   (OAM) require identification of the SR tunnel ingress and the path,
   constructed by segments, between the ingress and the egress SR nodes.
   Combination of IPv6 encapsulation [RFC8200] and SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header], referred to as SRv6, comply
   with these requirements while it is challenging when applying SR in
   MPLS networks, also referred to as SR-MPLS.

   On the other hand, the size of IPv6 SID presents a scaling challenge
   to use topological instructions that define strict explicit traffic-
   engineered (TE) path or support network programming in combination
   with service-based instructions.  At the same time, that is where SR-
   MPLS approach provides better results due to smaller SID length.  It
   can be used to compress the SRv6 header size when a smaller namespace
   of available SIDs is sufficient for addressing the particular
   network.

   SR-MPLS is broadly used in metro networks.  With the gradual
   deployment of SRv6 in the core networks, supporting interworking
   between SR-MPLS and SRv6 becomes the necessity for operators.  It is
   operationally more efficient and straightforward if SRv6 can use the
   same size SIDs as in SR-MPLS.  The SRH can be extended to define the
   same as in SR-MPLS SID length to support the unified segment
   identifier (U-SID).  As a result, end-to-end SR tunnel may use U-SIDs
   across SR-MPLS and SRv6 domains.

   SRH format has been defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] as presented in Figure 1

                           Figure 1: SRH format

   This document defines a new field Size in the SRH Flags field as a
   two-bits field with the following values:

      0b00 - 128-bits SID, an IPv6 address.

      0b01 - 32-bits SID.  In some environments, the context could be of
      IPv4 address, while in some other cases, it could represent an
      index of list or range of IPv4/IPv6 addresses.  Another
      interpretation of 32-bits SID could be as a complementary element
      of an IPv4/IPv6 prefix.  The setting of the interpretation might
      be done through the control plane based signaling and is outside
      the scope of this document.  If this SID represents a
      complementary part of an IPv4/IPv6 prefix, the original IP address
      can be re-constructed by using, for example, mapping, stitching,
      shifting or translating operation.  Specification of such a
      mechanism is outside the scope of this document.

      0b10 - 32-bits SID, which includes an MPLS label in the leftmost
      20-bits as displayed in Figure 2.  Information in the Context

   Entries of the segment list in the SRH MUST be of the same length.

4.  The Use Case of Unified Segment Identifier

   U-SID can be used for interworking between SR-MPLS and SRv6 domains.
   SR-MPLS is often used in a metro network, for example, in the
   backhaul metro network of CMCC.  If the core network uses SRv6, for
   example, the core network of the same operator, U-SID can be used in
   the SRv6 domain to interwork with SR-MPLS in the metro network to
   form an end-to-end tunnel.

4.1.  Interworking Between SR-MPLS and SRv6 Using U-SID

   SR-MPLS uses SR SIDs as MPLS label in MPLS stack, and the SIDs are
   32-bits long.  SRv6 uses SR SIDs as IPv6 extension header in SRH, and
   the SIDs are 128-bits long.

   The U-SID uses the same 32-bits long SIDs in MPLS stack and SRH.
   Thus, four 32-bits long U-SIDs can be placed in the space of a single
   128-bits long header.  The encapsulation is illustrated in Figure 3.

   family.  The SRv6 border nodes (E/G) receive SR-MPLS packets and
   forward them into the SRv6 domain using an SR-MPLS Binding SID
   [RFC8660].

                  Figure 4: SR-MPLS and SRv6 interworking

   The SRv6 edge node E assigns two SIDs, e.g., E1 and E2, E1 is an SR-
   MPLS Node-SID, E2 is an SR-MPLS Binding-SID, which represents an SRv6
   policy (from E to F, via segment list E-G-H-F) with U-SID
   encapsulation.  At the headend A, the end-to-end segment list could
   be B-E1-E2-F.  Figure 6 demonstrates an example of the packet
   forwarding, where U-SID is an MPLS label.

   The controller may assign the end-to-end SR tunnel U-SIDs (from A to
   F), and another method is outside the scope of this document.

   The reverse interworking is illustrated in Figure 5.  An end-to-end
   SR tunnel from F to A crosses the SRv6 and SR-MPLS domains.  The SRv6
   border nodes (E/G) receive SRv6 packets and forward them into the SR-
   MPLS domain using an SR-MPLS Binding SID or normal Prefix/Adjacency
   SID.

              Figure 5: SR-MPLS and SRv6 reverse interworking

   The SRv6 edge node F assigns an SR-MPLS Binding-SID F2, which
   represents an SRv6 policy (from F to E, via segment list F-H-G-E)
   with U-SID encapsulation.  At the headend F, the end-to-end segment
   list could be F2-B-A.

5.  Operations with Unified Segment Identifier

   When SRH is used to include 32-bits long U-SIDs, the ingress and
   transit nodes of an SR tunnel act as described in Section 5.1 and
   Section 5.2 of [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] respectively.

   If U-SID is used to support interworking between SR-MPLS and SRv6
   domains, it is beneficial that U-SID type matches to an MPLS label.
   In that case, an ILM (Incoming Label Map) entry can be used to map a
   U-SID to an IPv6 address.  As a result, it is not necessary to
   introduce a new type of index-based mapping table.  For ILM entry of



Weiqiang, et al.         Expires August 22, 2020                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           Unified Identifier SRv6           February 2020


   Adjacency-SID, the mapping result copied to DA (Destination Address)
   is the remote interface IPv6 address, for ILM entry of Node-SID, the
   mapping result that is copied into DA is a remote node loopback IPv6
   address.

   Operations on an MPLS label of U-SID type are the same as those
   defined in [RFC8663].  However, SR-MPLS over SRH has the following
   advantages compared with SR-MPLS over UDP:

   o  SRH is flexible to extend flags or sub-TLVs for service
      requirements, but UDP not.

   o  Labels in SRH can meet 8 bytes alignment requirements as per
      [RFC8200], but UDP not.

   o  The source address of the SR policy is not discarded, but UDP not.

5.1.  Procedures of SR-MPLS over IP

   Procedures of SR-MPLS over IP of [RFC8663] described how to construct
   an adjusted SR-MPLS FTN (FEC-to-NHLFE map) and ILM entry towards a
   prefix-SID when next-hops are IP-only routers.  The action of FTN and
   ILM entry will steer the packet along an outer tunnel to the
   destination node that has originated the FEC (Forwarding Equivalence
   Class).  UDP header is removed and put again at the each segment
   endpoint.  However, for SR-MPLS over SRH in this document we don't
   try to depend on that adjusted FIB (Forwarding Information Base)
   entry, because there are not any actions needed to get from the FIB
   entry, a traditional ILM entry (maybe without out-label because of
   IP-only next-hop) is enough to get the FEC information, i.e., to map
   a U-SID to an IPv6 address and copy to DA.  Note that an
   implementation can get both FEC and next-hop/interface forwarding
   information from the ILM entry, to avoid extra FIB lookup.  An SRv6
   policy chosen to encapsulate U-SID list within SRH is determined at
   the ingress node of this SRv6 policy, SRH is preserved along the SR
   to egress, though PSP (Penultimate Segment Popping) may be used, that
   is different from SR-MPLS over IP/UDP method [RFC8663], so the source
   address (i.e., the ingress of the SRv6 policy) is not discarded.

5.2.  Packet Forwarding

   U-SID based packet forwarding is similar to the processing described
   in [RFC8663].  But it differs from that in FIB action and segment
   list processing.  For completeness, we repeat the description of
   [RFC8663] with modification as follows.

                    Figure 6: Packet Forwarding Example

   In the example shown in Figure 6, assume that routers A, E, G, and H
   are U-SID capable (i.e., both SR-MPLS and SRv6 capable ) while the
   remaining routers (B, C, D, and F) are only capable of forwarding IP
   packets.  Routers A, E, G, and H advertise their Segment Routing
   related information via IS-IS or OSPF.

   Now assume that router A (the Domain ingress) wants to send a packet
   to router H (the Domain egress) via an SRv6 policy with the explicit
   path {E->G->H}. Router A will impose an MPLS label stack within SRH
   on the packet that corresponds to that explicit path.  Router A
   searches ILM entry by the top label (that indicated router E), get
   the FEC information and next-hop/interface forwarding information, a
   loopback IPv6 address of E, and then copy to DA and sends the packet.
   The value of SRH.SL is 2.

   When the IPv6 packet arrives at router E, router E picks the next
   segment (label) within SRH based on the SRH.SL value of 2, searches
   ILM entry by the next label, get the FEC information and next-hop/
   interface forwarding information, a loopback IPv6 address of G, and
   then copy to DA and sends the packet.  The value of SRH.SL is 1.

   When the IPv6 packet arrives at router G, router G gets the next
   segment (label) within SRH based on the SRH.SL value of 1, looks up
   ILM entry by the next label, gets the FEC information and next-hop/

   interface forwarding information, a loopback IPv6 address of H, and
   then copies it to IP DA and transmits the packet.  Because the value
   of SRH.SL is 0, the SRH can be removed if the behavior flavor
   codepoint of next segment (label) is set to PSP.

   Processing of SRH with elements carrying 20 bits-long SIDs closely
   follows SRH processing as defined in Section 4.3.1.1

5.3.  Control Plane in Support of Unified SID

   The introduction of the Unified Identifier may rely on the existing
   SR extensions to the routing protocols.  But some enhancements in the

Internet-Draft           Unified Identifier SRv6           February 2020


   control plane are still required.  This section references to the
   existing protocols and identifies necessary extensions.

   SR extensions to Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP), IS-IS [RFC8667],
   OSPF [RFC8665], and OSPFv3 [RFC8666], defined how 20-bits and 32-bits
   SIDs advertised and bound to SR objects and/or instructions.
   Extensions to BGP Link-state address family
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext] enabled propagation of
   segment information of variable length via BGP.

6.  U-SID supporting SRv6 programming

   U-SID can support SRv6 programming defined by
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].  The details will be
   described in another document.

7.  Implementation Considerations

   The Unified SID solution has been already implemented and tested by
   two companies:

   o  Centec has conducted its PoC, and the report is available at
      https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1540023.

   o  Broadcom, in its lab, also conducted PoC testing of the U-SID
      solution.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate from the Segment Routing Header Flags
   registry the two-bits long field referred to as Size.

9.  Security Considerations

   This specification inherits all security considerations of [RFC8402]
   and [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].
