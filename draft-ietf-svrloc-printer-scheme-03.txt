Abstract 

   This document is a submission to the Service Location Working Group
   of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  Comments should be
   submitted to the srvloc@srvloc.org mailing list.  
   
   This document defines the 'printer' service type and the attributes
   associated with it.  This 'printer' service template is designed to
   be used in conjunction with the Service Location Protocol, Version 2 
   [13], but it may be used with any directory service which supports
   attribute/value pair registration.  
   
   The 'printer' service type is specified as an abstract service type.
   It is expected that printers advertised with the 'printer' service
   type may be accessible by one or more protocols.  IPP [3] and LPR [2]
   are two examples of printing protocols that may be used to perform
   the actual printing.

Internet Draft        'printer' Service Template        19 February 1999



1.  Introduction

   Service Type templates are used to describe in a standard way those
   services which use the 'service:' URL.  The template described in
   this document is an abstract type that includes concrete types such
   as the printing protocol defined in RFC 1179 [2], "Line Printer
   Daemon Protocol".  The service type for this 'service:' URL is
   'printer'.  
   
   The 'printer:' service URL scheme supports consistent registration of
   printer services.  The attributes described within this document are 
   derived from previous specifications developed by the IETF IPP WG and
   IETF Printer MIB WG.  
   
   The attributes specified are intended to facilitate both automatic as
   well as manual selection of services, not to provide service
   statistics or notification.  In short, the target audience of service
   attributes are users, either software agents or end users.  



2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [14].

3.  urlpath Definition

   The 'printer' type is an abstract service type.  Because an abstract 
   service type may contain one of many concrete types, the 'urlpath'
   associated with a 'printer:' service URL may vary.  Two types of
   printers that are expected to be common in printer URLs are IPP and
   LPR.  



3.1.  IPP

   An IPP printer MAY support several underlying transport protocols.
   The definition of an IPP Printer object is specified in "IPP/1.1
   Model and Semantics" [3].  The definition of an IPP printer concrete
   URL is specified in "IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport" [9].  
   
   Examples of valid 'service:' URLs for IPP printers include:  
   
   service:printer:ipp://server.sun.com/cgi-bin/public-printer
   service:printer:ipp://foo.sun.com/printers?public-printer



3.2.  LPR

   An LPR accessible printer MAY include a queue name as the last part
   of the URL.  If the queue name is absent, the print server is assumed
   to use a default print queue.  The definition of an LPR printer
   concrete URL is specified in this document, in the 'printer' service
   template.  
   
   Examples of valid 'service:' URLs for LPR printers include:  
   
   service:printer:lpr://server.sun.com
   service:printer:lpr://server.sun.com/public-printer

4.  Printer Service Template

   The 'printer' service template defined below conforms to the grammar 
   described in "Service Templates and service: Schemes".  Please refer 
   to [4] for detailed explanation of the syntax.  
   
   Name of submitters: Pete St. Pierre <Pete.StPierre@eng.sun.com>
                       Scott Isaacson <sisaacson@novell.com>
                       Ira McDonald <imcdonal@sdsp.mc.xerox.com>
   
   Language of service template: en (English)
   
   Security Considerations:
      By advertising the security methods associated with each supported
      printer URL via the mandatory attributes 'printer-uri-supported'
      and 'uri-security-supported', the printer may expose information
      useful to attackers.  Some security method, such as SLP security,
      should be used to authenticate service advertisements.

            print server.  The device or server understands one or
            more network print protocols such as IPP or LPR.

5.  Summary of Required Attributes

   The purpose of having attributes associated with a 'service:' URL is 
   to provide a dynamic search capability to service location clients.  
   It is not intended to burden server implementations with additional
   information to provide in a registration.  For this reason, only a a
   small subset (6) of the attributes defined in this template are
   required in compliant service registrations.  
   
   Mandatory                       Optional
   ---------                       --------
   printer-uri-supported           printer-location
   uri-security-supported          printer-info
   printer-name                    printer-more-info
   natural-language-configured     printer-make-and-model
   natural-language-supported      charset-configured
   document-format-supported       charset-supported

                                   finishings-supported
                                   number-up-supported
                                   sides-supported

6.  Summary of Attribute Origins

   The following table summarizes all of the attributes in the 'printer'
   service template and their origins.  This table does NOT include the 
   'template-xxx' standard attributes defined in "Service Templates and 
   service: Schemes" [4] and required for all 'service:' templates.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Registration of this 'printer' service template will follow the
   procedures defined in section 4 'A Procedure for Standardizing New
   Service Types' and section 5 'IANA Considerations' of "Service
   Templates and service: Schemes" [4].  



8.  Internationalization Considerations

   All attribute values in registrations using this 'printer' service
   template MUST be encoded in UTF-8 characters, as required by "Service
   Location Protocol, Version 2" [13].  Thus, all registrations using
   this 'printer' service template conform to "IETF Policy on Character 
   Sets and Languages" [12].  



9.  Security Considerations

   When used with SLPv2, this 'printer' service template inherits all of
   the security issues described in section 17 'Security Considerations'
   of "Service Location Protocol, Version 2" [13].
