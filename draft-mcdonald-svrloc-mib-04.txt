Internet Draft      Service Location Protocol MIB       27 February 2003



1.  Introduction

   The SLP MIB supports minimal passive monitoring of SLPv2 agents for
   network management purposes.  The SLP MIB also supports (optional)
   passive monitoring of configured or discovered SLPv2 DA/SA network
   addresses and SLPv2 DA/SA attributes.  
   
   This document is structured as follows:  
   
   - Section 2 briefly describes the SNMP network management framework.
     
   - Section 3 enumerates design requirements for the SLP MIB.  
     
   - Section 4 provides an overview of the SLP MIB, including
     conformance terminology and SLP-specific terminology.  
     
   - Section 5 specifies the SLP MIB in SMIv2 [RFC2578], including the
     conformance requirements for SNMP Command Responders that claim
     conformance to this document.  
     
   - Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 specify IANA, intellectual property,
     internationalization, and security considerations.  
     
   - Sections 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 list acknowledgements, normative
     references, informative references, authors' addresses, and full
     IETF copyright statement.  



2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Design Requirements for SLP MIB

   The SLP MIB design requirements listed below are _not_ conformance
   requirements on _implementations_ of the SLP MIB.  Therefore the
   words must, should, and may are used below in lowercase (informative
   per [RFC2119] conventions).  
   
   (1) The SLP MIB must provide an SNMP interface to monitor SLPv2
       [RFC2608] directory agents (DAs), service agents (SAs), and user
       agents (UAs).  
       
   (2) The SLP MIB must be organized so that access can be controlled
       effectively by using the User-based Security Model [RFC2574] and 
       the View-based Access Control Model [RFC2575] from the SNMPv3
       framework.  
       
   (3) The SLP MIB must not compromise native security in SLPv2
       [RFC2608] by exposing private keys or other confidential
       information via SNMP.  
       
   (4) The SLP MIB must define a core set of mandatory object groups
       that support minimal passive monitoring requirements.  
       
   (5) The SLP MIB must use UTF-8 [2279] for all human-readable text
       strings per [RFC2277] for internationalization support.  



4.  Overview of SLP MIB

   The SLP MIB can be used to monitor SLPv2 [RFC2608] directory agents
   (DAs), service agents (SAs), and user agents (UAs).  The SLP MIB
   makes no assumptions about the particular system topology of the
   managed SLP agents (for example, they may be distributed across
   several rack-mounted processors in a router).  
   
   
   
   4.1.  Conformance Terminology
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet Draft      Service Location Protocol MIB       27 February 2003

   
   
   4.2.  SLP Terminology
   
   The SLP MIB uses the following definitions from SLPv2 [RFC2608]:  
   
   - "User Agent (UA)" 
     A process working on the user's behalf to establish contact with
     some service.  The UA retrieves service information from the
     Service Agents or Directory Agents.  
     
   - "Service Agent (SA)" 
     A process working on the behalf of one or more services to
     advertise the services.  
     
   - "Directory Agent (DA)" 
     A process which collects service advertisements.  There can only be
     one DA present per given host.  
     
   - "Scope" 
     A set of services, typically making up a logical administrative
     group.  
   
   
   
   4.3.  Abstract Model of SLP MIB
   
   The Agent group is the principal object group in the abstract model
   defined in the SLP MIB.  
   
   The Scope, Address, and Attribute tables (all subordinate to
   "slpAgentTable") each use a high-order index of "slpAgentIndex" for
   linkage to the "slpAgentTable".

   |===========|
         |        INDEX { slpAgentIndex }
         |
         |

         |              (Optional)
         |        0..* |===========|
         |.............|  Address  |  (One row per remote DA/SA address)
         |             |===========|
         |                            INDEX { slpAgentIndex,
         |                                    slpAddressIndex }
         |
         |              (Optional)
         |        0..* |===========|
         |.............| Attribute |  (One row per DA/SA attr)
                       |===========|
                                      INDEX { slpAgentIndex,
                                              slpAttributeIndex }
   
   
   
   4.4.  Relationship to SNMP Framework MIB (RFC 3411)
   
   The SLP MIB defines all text strings with a syntax of
   'SnmpAdminString' [RFC3411] which supports human-readable information
   in UTF-8 [RFC2279].  
   
   
   
   4.5.  Relationship to Host Resources MIB (RFC 2790)
   
   The SLP MIB supports specification of the SLP agent software for each
   managed SLP agent via a pointer to the 'hrSWInstalledTable' in the
   Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] in the following object:  
   
   - "slpAgentSWInstalledIndexOrZero" - a value for "hrSWInstalledIndex"
     in the Host Resources MIB for this SLP agent's software

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a base arc in the 'mgmt' (standards track) OID
   tree for the 'slpMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the SLP MIB.  
   
   The following definitions in the SLP MIB depend on IANA
   registrations:  
   
   - "slpAgentMessageTypesSupported" contains an array of the binary
     values assigned by SLPv2 [RFC2608] or assigned by IANA for the
     Function-ID in SLPv2 messages.  
     
   - "slpAgentExtensionsSupported" contains an array of the binary
     values assigned by SLPv2 [RFC2608] or assigned by IANA for the
     Extension ID in SLPv2 messages.  
   
   There are no other IANA considerations associated with the SLP MIB.  



7.  Intellectual Property

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in RFC 2028.  Copies of 
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.  
   
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive 
   Director.  



8.  Internationalization Considerations

   The SLP MIB defines all text strings with a syntax of
   'SnmpAdminString' [RFC3411] which supports human-readable information
   in UTF-8 [RFC2279].  The SLP MIB is therefore in full conformance

Bakke, McDonald             Expires 27 August 2003             [Page 19]

Internet Draft      Service Location Protocol MIB       27 February 2003

   with the best practices in "IETF Policy on Character Sets and
   Languages" [RFC2277].  



9.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have 
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.  
   
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:  
   
   slpAgentTable:
     slpAgentSWInstalledIndexOrZero  - possible configuration data loss
     slpAgentName                    - possible configuration data loss
     slpAgentType                    - possible configuration data loss
     slpAgentIsBroadcastOnly         - possible configuration data loss
     slpAgentActiveDADiscovery       - possible configuration data loss
     slpAgentPassiveDADiscovery      - possible configuration data loss
     slpAgentMessageTypesSupported   - possible configuration data loss
     slpAgentExtensionsSupported     - possible configuration data loss
   
   slpScopeTable:
     slpScopeSource                  - possible configuration data loss
     slpScopeValue                   - possible configuration data loss
   
   slpAddressTable:
     slpAddressAgentType             - possible configuration data loss
     slpAddressSource                - possible configuration data loss
     slpAddressOrName                - possible configuration data loss
   
   slpAttributeTable:
     slpAttributeName                - possible configuration data loss
     slpAttributeType                - possible configuration data loss
     slpAttributeValue               - possible configuration data loss
   
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.  


Bakke, McDonald             Expires 27 August 2003             [Page 20]

Internet Draft      Service Location Protocol MIB       27 February 2003

   
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).  
   
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
