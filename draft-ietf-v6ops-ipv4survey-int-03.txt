Abstract

   This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in
   currently deployed IETF Internet Area documented standards.  In order
   to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6
   Internet, many interim steps will be taken. One of these steps is the
   evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It is
   hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be
   redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will
   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards
   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be
   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.

1. Introduction

   This document is part of a document set aiming to document all usage
   of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards. In an effort to have the
   information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents
   conforming to the current IETF areas (Application,  Internet,
   Management & Operations, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).

   This specific document focuses on usage of IPv4 addresses within the
   Internet area.

   For a full introduction, please see the introduction [1] document.

2. Document Organization

   The following sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis
   of Full, Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each
   RFC is discussed in turn starting with RFC 1 and ending in (about)
   RFC 3100. The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.  That is,
   each RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do
   not "look ahead" to see if any of the issues raised have already been
   fixed.

   Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,
   and 6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole
   and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are
   correlated.

3. Full Standards

   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as
   "Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely
   implemented and used throughout the Internet.

3.1 RFC 791 Internet Protocol

   This specification defines IPv4 and is replaced by the IPv6
   specifications.

3.2 RFC 792 Internet Control Message Protocol

   This specification defines ICMP, and is inherently IPv4 dependent.

3.3 RFC 826 Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.4 RFC 891 DCN Local-Network Protocols

   There are many implicit assumptions about the use of IPv4 addresses
   in this document.

3.5 RFC 894 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernet
    networks

   This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4
   packets over Ethernet.

3.6 RFC 895 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over
    experimental Ethernet networks

   This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4
   packets over experimental Ethernet.

3.7 RFC 903 Reverse Address Resolution Protocol

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.8 RFC 919 Broadcasting Internet Datagrams

   This specification defines broadcasting for IPv4; IPv6 uses multicast
   so this is not applicable.

3.9 RFC 922 Broadcasting Internet datagrams in the presence of subnets

   This specification defines how broadcasts should be treated in the

   presence of subnets. IPv6 uses multicast so this is not applicable.

3.10 RFC 950 Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure

   This specification defines IPv4 subnetting; similar functionality is
   part of IPv6 addressing architecture to begin with.

3.11 RFC 1034 Domain Names: Concepts and Facilities

   In Section 3.6, "Resource Records", the definition of A record is:

     RDATA           which is the type and sometimes class dependent
                     data which describes the resource:

                     A         For the IN class, a 32 bit IP address

   And Section 5.2.1, "Typical functions" defines:

     1. Host name to host address translation.

        This function is often defined to mimic a previous HOSTS.TXT
        based function.  Given a character string, the caller wants
        one or more 32 bit IP addresses.  Under the DNS, it
        translates into a request for type A RRs.  Since the DNS does


        not preserve the order of RRs, this function may choose to
        sort the returned addresses or select the "best" address if
        the service returns only one choice to the client.  Note that
        a multiple address return is recommended, but a single
        address may be the only way to emulate prior HOSTS.TXT
        services.

     2. Host address to host name translation

        This function will often follow the form of previous
        functions.  Given a 32 bit IP address, the caller wants a
        character string.  The octets of the IP address are reversed,
        used as name components, and suffixed with "IN-ADDR.ARPA".  A
        type PTR query is used to get the RR with the primary name of
        the host.  For example, a request for the host name
        corresponding to IP address 1.2.3.4 looks for PTR RRs for
        domain name "4.3.2.1.IN-ADDR.ARPA".

   There are, of course, numerous examples of IPv4 addresses scattered
   throughout the document.

3.12 RFC 1035 Domain Names: Implementation and Specification

   Section 3.4.1, "A RDATA format", defines the format for A records:


         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         |                    ADDRESS                    |
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

     where:

     ADDRESS         A 32 bit Internet address.

     Hosts that have multiple Internet addresses will have
     multiple A records.

     A records cause no additional section processing.  The
     RDATA section of an A line in a master file is an Internet
     address expressed as four decimal numbers separated by dots
     without any imbedded spaces (e.g.,"10.2.0.52" or "192.0.5.6").


   And Section 3.4.2, "WKS RDATA", format is:


     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     |                    ADDRESS                    |
     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     |       PROTOCOL        |                       |
     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+                       |
     |                                               |
     /                   <BIT MAP>                   /

     /                                               /
     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

       where:

       ADDRESS         An 32 bit Internet address

       PROTOCOL        An 8 bit IP protocol number

       <BIT MAP>       A variable length bit map.  The bit map
                   must be a multiple of 8 bits long.

       The WKS record is used to describe the well known services
       supported by a particular protocol on a particular internet
       address.  The PROTOCOL field specifies an IP protocol number,



Mickles & Nesser         Expires March 31, 2004                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Survey of IPv4 Addresses in Internet Area     Oct 2003


       and the bit map has one bit per port of the specified protocol.
       The first bit corresponds to port 0, the second to port 1, etc.
       If the bit map does not include a bit for a protocol of
       interest, that bit is assumed zero.  The appropriate values and
       mnemonics for ports and protocols are specified in [RFC-1010].

       For example, if PROTOCOL=TCP (6), the 26th bit corresponds to
       TCP port 25 (SMTP).  If this bit is set, a SMTP server should be
       listening on TCP port 25; if zero, SMTP service is not supported
       on the specified address.

       The purpose of WKS RRs is to provide availability information for
       servers for TCP and UDP.  If a server supports both TCP and UDP,
       or has multiple Internet addresses, then multiple WKS RRs are
       used.

       WKS RRs cause no additional section processing.


   Section 3.5, "IN-ADDR.ARPA domain", describes reverse DNS lookups and
   is clearly IPv4 dependent.

   There are, of course, numerous examples of IPv4 addresses scattered
   throughout the document.

3.13 RFC 1042 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over IEEE
     802 networks

   This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4
   packets over IEEE 802 networks.

3.14 RFC 1044 Internet Protocol on Network System's HYPERchannel:
     Protocol Specification

   There are a variety of methods used in this standard to map IPv4
   addresses to 32 bits fields in the HYPERchannel headers.  This
   specification does not support IPv6.

3.15 RFC 1055 Nonstandard for transmission of IP datagrams over serial
     lines: SLIP

   This specification is more of a analysis of the shortcomings of SLIP
   which is unsurprising.  The introduction of PPP as a general
   replacement of SLIP has made this specification essentially unused.
   No update need be considered.

3.16 RFC 1088 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over NetBIOS
     networks

   This specification documents a technique to encapsulate IP packets
   inside NetBIOS packets.

   The technique presented of using NetBIOS names of the form
   IP.XX.XX.XX.XX will not work for IPv6 addresses since the length of
   IPv6 addresses will not fit within the NetBIOS 15 octet name
   limitation.

3.17 RFC 1112 Host Extensions for IP Multicasting

   This specification defines IP multicast.  Parts of the document are
   IPv4 dependent.

3.18 RFC 1132 Standard for the transmission of 802.2 packets over IPX
     networks

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.19 RFC 1201 Transmitting IP traffic over ARCNET networks

   The major concerns of this specification with respect to IPv4
   addresses occur in the resolution of ARCnet 8bit addresses to IPv4
   addresses in an "ARPlike" method.  This is incompatible with IPv6.

3.20 RFC 1209 The Transmission of IP Datagrams over the SMDS Service

   This specification defines running IPv4 and ARP over SMDS.  The
   methods described could easily be extended to support IPv6 packets.

3.21 RFC 1390 Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks

   This specification defines the use of IPv4 address on FDDI networks.
   There are numerous IPv4 dependencies in the specification.

   In particular the value of the Protocol Type Code (2048 for IPv4) and
   a corresponding Protocol Address length (4 bytes for IPv4) needs to
   be created.  A discussion of broadcast and multicast addressing
   techniques is also included, and similarly must be updated for IPv6
   networks.  The defined MTU limitation of 4096 octets of data (with

4. Draft Standards

   Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple,
   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are
   usually quite mature and widely used.

4.1 RFC 951 Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)

   This protocol is designed specifically for use with IPv4, for
   example:

    Section 3. Packet Format

    All numbers shown are decimal, unless indicated otherwise.  The
    BOOTP packet is enclosed in a standard IP [8] UDP [7] datagram.  For
    simplicity it is assumed that the BOOTP packet is never fragmented.
    Any numeric fields shown are packed in 'standard network byte
    order', i.e. high order bits are sent first.

    In the IP header of a bootrequest, the client fills in its own IP
    source address if known, otherwise zero.  When the server address is
    unknown, the IP destination address will be the 'broadcast address'
    255.255.255.255.  This address means 'broadcast on the local cable,
    (I don't know my net number)' [4].

         FIELD   BYTES   DESCRIPTION
         -----   -----   ---

     [...]
            ciaddr  4       client IP address;
                            filled in by client in bootrequest if known.

            yiaddr  4       'your' (client) IP address;
                            filled by server if client doesn't
                            know its own address (ciaddr was 0).

            siaddr  4       server IP address;
                            returned in bootreply by server.

            giaddr  4       gateway IP address,
                            used in optional cross-gateway booting.

   Since the packet format is a fixed 300 bytes in length, an updated
   version of the specification could easily accommodate an additional
   48 bytes (4 IPv6 fields of 16 bytes to replace the existing 4 IPv4
   fields of 4 bytes).

4.2 RFC 1188 Proposed Standard for the Transmission of IP  Datagrams
    over FDDI Networks

   This document is clearly informally superceded by RFC 1390,
   "Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks", even though no
   formal deprecation has been done.  Therefore, this specification is
   not considered further in this memo.

4.3 RFC 1191 Path MTU discovery

   The entire process of PMTU discovery is predicated on the use of the
   DF bit in the IPv4 header, an ICMP message (also IPv4 dependent) and
   TCP MSS option.  This is not compatible with IPv6.

4.4 RFC 1356 Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN

   Section 3.2 defines an NLPID for IP as follows:

      The value hex CC (binary 11001100, decimal 204) is IP [6].
      Conformance with this specification requires that IP be supported.
      See section 5.1 for a diagram of the packet formats.

   Clearly a new NLPID would need to be defined for IPv6 packets.

4.5 RFC 1534 Interoperation Between DHCP and BOOTP

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.6 RFC 1542 Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol

   header field:

      Class
         The Class field is one octet and indicates the identifier

         address space.  The most up-to-date values of the LCP Endpoint
         Discriminator Class field are specified in the most recent
         "Assigned Numbers" RFC [7].  Current values are assigned as
         follows:

           0    Null Class

           1    Locally Assigned Address

           2    Internet Protocol (IP) Address

           3    IEEE 802.1 Globally Assigned MAC Address

           4    PPP Magic-Number Block

           5    Public Switched Network Directory Number

   A new class field needs to be defined by the IANA for IPv6 addresses.

4.11 RFC 1994 PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.12 RFC 2067 IP over HIPPI

   Section 5.1, "Packet Formats", contains the following excerpt:

    EtherType (16 bits) SHALL be set as defined in Assigned Numbers [8]:
    IP = 2048 ('0800'h), ARP = 2054 ('0806'h), RARP = 32,821 ('8035'h).

   Section 5.5, "MTU", has the following definition:

     The MTU for HIPPI-SC LANs is 65280 bytes.

     This value was selected because it allows the IP packet to fit in
     one 64K byte buffer with up to 256 bytes of overhead.  The overhead
     is 40 bytes at the present time; there are 216 bytes of room for
     expansion.

            HIPPI-FP Header                  8 bytes
            HIPPI-LE Header                 24 bytes
            IEEE 802.2 LLC/SNAP Headers      8 bytes
            Maximum IP packet size (MTU) 65280 bytes
                                         ------------
                              Total      65320 bytes (64K - 216)

   This definition is not applicable for IPv6 packets since packets can
   be larger than the IPv4 limitation of 65280 bytes.

4.13 RFC 2131 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

   This version of DHCP is highly assumptive of IPv4.  It is not

5. Proposed Standards

   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no
   requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases
   Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards
   process.  They therefore are often just proposed ideas that are
   presented to the Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or
   they are one of many competing solutions to problems.  In these later
   cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose
   of this discussion.

5.1 RFC 1234 Tunneling IPX traffic through IP networks

   The section "Unicast Address Mappings" has the following text:

    For implementations of this memo, the first two octets of the host
    number will always be zero and the last four octets will be the
    node's four octet IP address.  This makes address mapping trivial
    for unicast transmissions: the first two octets of the host number
    are discarded, leaving the normal four octet IP address.  The
    encapsulation code should use this IP address as the destination
    address of the UDP/IP tunnel packet.

   This mapping will not be able to work with IPv6 addresses.

   There are also numerous discussions on systems keeping a "peer list"
   to map between IP and IPX addresses.  The specifics are not discussed
   in the document and are left to the individual implementation.

   The section "Maximum Transmission Unit" also has some implications on
   IP addressing:

    Although larger IPX packets are possible, the standard maximum
    transmission unit for IPX is 576 octets.  Consequently, 576 octets
    is the recommended default maximum transmission unit for IPX packets
    being sent with this encapsulation technique.  With the eight octet
    UDP header and the 20 octet IP header, the resulting IP packets will
    be 604 octets long.  Note that this is larger than the 576 octet
    maximum size IP implementations are required to accept [3].  Any IP
    implementation supporting this encapsulation technique must be
    capable of receiving 604 octet IP packets.

    As improvements in protocols and hardware allow for larger,
    unfragmented IP transmission units, the 576 octet maximum IPX packet
    size may become a liability.  For this reason, it is recommended
    that the IPX maximum transmission unit size be configurable in
    implementations of this memo.

5.2 RFC 1256 ICMP Router Discovery Messages

   This specification defines a mechanism very specific to IPv4.

5.3 RFC 1277 Encoding Network Addresses to Support Operation over
    Non-OSI Lower Layers

   Section 4.5, "TCP/IP (RFC 1006) Network Specific Format" describes a
   structure that reserves 12 digits for the textual representation of
   an IP address.

   This 12 octet field for decimal versions of IP addresses is
   insufficient for a decimal version of IPv6 addresses.  It is possible
   to define a new encoding using the 20 digit long IP Address + Port +
   Transport Set fields in order to accommodate a binary version of an
   IPv6 address, port number and Transport Set.  There are several
   schemes that could be envisioned.

5.4 RFC 1332 The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)

   This specification defines a mechanism for devices to assign IPv4
   addresses to PPP clients once PPP negotiation is completed.  Section
   3, "IPCP Configuration Options", defines IPCP option types which
   embed the IP address in 4-byte long fields.  This is clearly not
   enough for IPv6.

   However, the specification is clearly designed to allow new Option
   Types to be added and Should offer no problems for use with IPv6 once
   appropriate options have been defined.

5.5 RFC 1377 The PPP OSI Network Layer Control Protocol (OSINLCP)

5.32 RFC 2225 Classical IP and ARP over ATM

   From the many references in this document it is clear that this
   document is designed for IPv4 only.  It is only later in the document
   that it is implicitly stated, as in:

       ar$spln -  length in octets of the source protocol address. Value
                  range is 0 or 4 (decimal).  For IPv4 ar$spln is 4.

       ar$tpln -  length in octets of the target protocol address. Value
                  range is 0 or 4 (decimal).  For IPv4 ar$tpln is 4.

   and:

     For backward compatibility with previous implementations, a null
     IPv4 protocol address may be received with length = 4 and an
     allocated address in storage set to the value 0.0.0.0.  Receiving
     stations must be liberal in accepting this format of a null IPv4
     address.  However, on transmitting an ATMARP or InATMARP packet, a
     null IPv4 address must only be indicated by the length set to zero
     and must have no storage allocated.

         Length is (n * 4) and the value is an array of n IP addresses,
         each four bytes in length. The maximum number of addresses is 5
         and therefore the maximum length value is 20. The list contains
         the addresses of n NetWare Domain SAP/RIP Server (DSS).

     NEAREST_NWIP_SERVER (code 7)

         Length is (n * 4) and the value is an array of n IP addresses,
         each four bytes in length. The maximum number of addresses is 5
         and therefore the maximum length value is 20. The list contains
         the addresses of n Nearest NetWare/IP servers.

     PRIMARY_DSS (code 11)

         Length of 4, and the value is a single IP address.  This field

         identifies the Primary Domain SAP/RIP Service server (DSS) for
         this NetWare/IP domain. NetWare/IP administration utility uses

   And further along it states:


     A TIP URL takes the form:

        tip://<transaction manager address>?<transaction string>

     where <transaction manager address> identifies the TIP transaction
     manager (as defined in Section 7 above); and <transaction string>
     specifies a transaction identifier, which may take one of two forms
     (standard or non-standard):

     i. "urn:" <NID> ":" <NSS>

       A standard transaction identifier, conforming to the proposed
       Internet Standard for Uniform Resource Names (URNs), as specified
       by RFC2141; where <NID> is the Namespace Identifier, and <NSS> is
       the Namespace Specific String. The Namespace ID determines the
       syntactic interpretation of the Namespace Specific String. The
       Namespace Specific String is a sequence of characters representin
       a transaction identifier (as defined by <NID>). The rules for the
       contents of these fields are specified by [6] (valid characters,
       encoding, etc.).

       This format of <transaction string> may be used to express global
       transaction identifiers in terms of standard representations.
       Examples for <NID> might be <iso> or <xopen>. e.g.


          tip://123.123.123.123/?urn:xopen:xid

       Note that Namespace Ids require registration. See [7] for details
       on how to do this.

     ii. <transaction identifier>

       A sequence of printable ASCII characters (octets with values in
       the range 32 through 126 inclusive (excluding ":") representing a
       transaction identifier. In this non-standard case, it is the
       combination of <transaction manager address> and <transaction
       identifier> which ensures global uniqueness. e.g.

          tip://123.123.123.123/?transid1


   These are incompatible with IPv6.

6. Experimental RFCs

   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have
   widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often
   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented
   to the Internet community in order to allow potential
   interoperability or some other potential useful scenario.  In a few
   cases they are presented as alternatives to the mainstream solution
   to an acknowledged problem.

6.1 RFC 1149 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams on avian
    carriers

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.  In fact the
   flexibility of this specification is such that all versions of IP
   should function within its boundaries, presuming that the packets
   remain small enough to be transmitted with the 256 milligrams weight
   limitations.

        and the target terminal for which the NBMA address is desired.

   This is incompatible with IPv6.

6.13 RFC 1768 Host Group Extensions for CLNP Multicasting

   This specification defines multicasting for CLNP, which is not an IP
   protocol, and therefore has no IPv4 dependencies.

6.14 RFC 1788 ICMP Domain Name Messages

   This specification is used for updates to the in-addr.arpa reverse
   DNS maps, and is limited to IPv4.

6.15 RFC 1797 Class A Subnet Experiment

   This document is specific to IPv4 address architecture, and as such,
   has no IPv6 dependencies.

6.16 RFC 1819 Internet Stream Protocol Version 2 (ST2) Protocol
     Specification - Version ST2+

   This specification is IPv4 limited.  In fact it is the definition of
   IPv5.  It has been abandoned by the IETF as feasible design, and is
   not considered in this discussion.

6.17 RFC 1868 ARP Extension - UNARP

   This specification defines an extension to IPv4 ARP to delete entries
   from ARP caches on a link.

6.18 RFC 1876 A Means for Expressing Location Information in the Domain
     Name System

   This document defines a methodology for applying this technology
   which is IPv4 dependent.  The specification itself has no IPv4
   dependencies.

6.19 RFC 1888 OSI NSAPs and IPv6

   This is an IPv6 related document and is not discussed in this
   document.

6.20 RFC 2009 GPS-Based Addressing and Routing

   The document states:

     The future version of IP (IP v6) will certainly have a sufficient
     number of bits in its addressing space to provide an address for
     even smaller GPS addressable units.  In this proposal, however, we
     assume the current version of IP (IP v4) and we make sure that we
     manage the addressing space more economically than that.  We will
     call the smallest GPS addressable unit a GPS-square.

   This specification does not seem to have real IPv4 dependencies.

6.21 RFC 2143 Encapsulating IP with the SCSI

   This specification will only operate using IPv4.  As stated in the
   document:

     It was decided that the ten byte header offers the greatest
     flexibility for encapsulating version 4 IP datagrams for the
     following reasons: [...]

   This is incompatible with IPv6.

6.22 RFC 2345 Domain Names and Company Name Retrieval

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

6.25 RFC 2520 NHRP with Mobile NHCs

   This specification is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes.

6.26 RFC 2521 ICMP Security Failures Messages

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

6.27 RFC 2540 Detached Domain Name System (DNS) Information

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

7. Summary of the Results

   In the initial survey of RFCs 52 positives were identified out of a
   total of 186, broken down as follows:

      Standards				 17 of 24 or 70.83%

      Draft Standards			  6 of 20 or 30.00%

      Proposed Standards		 22 of 111 or 19.91%

      Experimental RFCs			 7 of 31 or 22.58%

   Of those identified many require no action because they document
   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols
   that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.
   Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be
   updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not
   updated.

7.1 Standards

7.1.1 RFC 791 Internet Protocol

   RFC 791 has been updated in the definition of IPv6 in RFC 2460.

7.1.2 RFC 792 Internet Control Message Protocol

   RFC 792 has been updated in the definition of ICMPv6 in RFC 2463.

7.1.3 RFC 891 DCN Networks

   DCN has long since been ceased to be used, so this specification is
   no longer relevant.

7.1.4 RFC 894 IP over Ethernet

   This problem has been fixed by RFC2464, A Method for the Transmission
   of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks.

7.1.5 RFC 895 IP over experimental Ethernets

   It is believed that experimental Ethernet networks are not being used
   anymore, so the specification is no longer relevant.

7.1.6 RFC 922 Broadcasting Internet Datagrams in the Presence of Subnets

   Broadcasting is not used in IPv6, but similar functionality has been

   included in RFC 3513, IPv6 Addressing Architecture.

7.1.7 RFC 950 Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure

   Broadcasting is not used in IPv6, but similar functionality has been
   included in RFC 3513, IPv6 Addressing Architecture.

7.1.8 RFC 1034 Domain Names: Concepts and Facilities

   The problems have been fixed by defining new resource records for
   IPv6 addresses.

7.1.9 RFC 1035 Domain Names: Implementation and Specification

   The problems have been fixed by defining new resource records for
   IPv6 addresses.

7.1.10 RFC 1042 IP over IEEE 802

   This problem has been fixed by RFC2470, Transmission of IPv6 Packets
   over Token Ring Networks.

7.1.11 RFC 1044 IP over HyperChannel

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.1.12 RFC 1088 IP over NetBIOS

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.1.13 RFC 1112 Host Extensions for IP Multicast

   The IPv4-specific parts of RFC 1112 have been updated in RFC 2710,
   Multicast Listener Discovery for IPv6.

7.1.14 RFC 1122 Requirements for Internet Hosts

   RFC 1122 is essentially a requirements document for IPv4 hosts.
   Similar work is in progress
   (draft-ietf-ipv6-node-requirements-xx.txt).

7.1.15 RFC 1201 IP over ARCNET

   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2497, A Method for the
   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over ARCnet Networks.

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.1.17 RFC 1390 Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks

   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2467, "Transmission of IPv6
   Packets over FDDI Networks".

7.2 Draft Standards

7.2.1 RFC 951 Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)

   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2462, IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration, and RFC3315, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   for IPv6 (DHCPv6).

7.2.2 RFC 1191 Path MTU Discovery

   This problem has been fixed in RFC 1981, Path MTU Discovery for IP
   version 6.

7.2.3 RFC 1356 Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN

   This problem can be fixed by defining a new NLPID for IPv6. Note that
   an NLPID has already been defined in RFC 2427, Multiprotocol
   Interconnect over Frame Relay.

7.2.4 RFC 1990 The PPP Multilink Protocol (MP)

   A new class identifier ("6") for IPv6 packets has been registered
   with the IANA by the original author, fixing this problem.

7.2.5 RFC 2067 IP over HIPPI

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.2.6 RFC 2131 DHCP

   This problem has been fixed in RFC 3315, Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).

   Further, the consensus of the DHC WG has been that the options
   defined for DHCPv4 will not be automatically "carried forward" to
   DHCPv6.  Therefore, any further analysis of additionally specified
   DHCPv4 Options has been omitted from this memo.

7.3 Proposed Standards

7.3.1 RFC 1234 Tunneling IPX over IP

   No updated document exists for this specification.  In practice, the
   similar effect can be achieved by the use of a layer 2 tunneling
   protocol. It is unclear whether an updated document is needed.

7.3.2 RFC 1256 ICMP Router Discovery

   This problem has been resolved in RFC 2461, Neighbor Discovery for IP
   Version 6 (IPv6).

7.3.3 RFC 1277 Encoding Net Addresses to Support Operation Over Non OSI
      Lower Layers

   No updated document exists for this specification; the problem might
   be resolved by the creation of a new encoding scheme if necessary. It
   is unclear whether an update is needed.

7.3.4 RFC 1332 PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)

   This problem has been resolved in RFC 2472, IP Version 6 over PPP.

7.3.5 RFC 1469 IP Multicast over Token Ring

   The functionality of this specification has been essentially covered
   in RFC 2470, Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Token Ring Networks.

7.3.6 RFC 2003 IP Encapsulation within IP

   This problem has been fixed by defining different IP-in-IP
   encapsulation, for example, RFC 2473, Generic Packet Tunneling in
   IPv6 Specification.

7.3.7 RFC 2004 Minimal Encapsulation within IP

   No updated document exists for this specification. It is unclear
   whether one is needed.
