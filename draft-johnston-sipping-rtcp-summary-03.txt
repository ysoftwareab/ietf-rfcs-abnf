Internet-Draft           RTCP Summary Delivery                 July 2004


1.  Introduction

   There is a general need for real-time reporting of session quality in
   enterprise and service provider networks.  While the approach
   discussed in this document is quite general, this document is limited
   in scope to the delivery of particular RTCP summary reports.

   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [3] defines Sender Reports (SR) and
   Receiver Reports (RR) which are exchanged between the participants in
   a media session about the quality of the media session.  RTCP
   Extended Reports (XR) [4] have also been defined to provide
   additional quality information.  In particular, two summary reports
   are included: a statistics summary report and a VoIP (Voice over IP)
   metrics block.

   This summary information is of particular interest to certain parties
   who may not be participants in the media session.  For example, a
   service provider might be interested in logging a summary report of
   the QoS of a VoIP session.  Alternatively, an enterprise might want
   to compile a summary of the QoS of multimedia sessions established
   over a wide area network.

   In the case of a gateway or other high-density device, the device is
   likely to implement various AAA protocols and have the ability to log
   and export this type of RTCP summary reports.  However, this is not
   practical in smaller endpoints such as SIP phones, clients, or mobile
   phones.

   This document discusses the requirements and a mechanism to allow a
   third party which is not a participant in a session receive RTCP
   summary reports.

2.  Requirements

   REQ-1: An authorized third party should be able to receive selected
   RTCP reports on a near real time basis.

   REQ-2: The VoIP application should not have to store large amounts of
   information.

   REQ-3: The VoIP application must be able to authenticate the third
   party.

   REQ-4: The RTCP report information must be able to be transferred
   securely.

   REQ-5: A VoIP application participating in a bi-directional session
   will store and send RTCP summary reports for both directions.

   REQ-6: The reports will include or be associated with dialog
   identifiers for correlation purposes.

3.  Motivations for the Approach

   Monitor the application:

   While QoS monitoring in network elements using for example SNMP is
   quite common, only the VoIP applications in endpoints are close
   enough to the experience of individual users, on a call by call basis
   in endpoints as diverse as desktop SIP phones, PDAs, PCs or mobile
   phones.  For this reason, the approach taken here is to monitor the
   voice quality at the application level and not in network elements.

   Focus on voice specific impairments:

   RTCP extensions support the monitoring of various impairments such as
   packet loss, delay and jitter, but more important, specific metrics
   are included to measure burst errors that produce voice clipping.
   Voice clipping is the most annoying impairment in VoIP due to network
   congestion in the media path between VoIP applications.

4.  Why SNMP is Not Appropriate

   Since this type of QoS monitoring seems related to management, SNMP
   could possibly be used to collect this type of data as well.  SNMP is
   however primarily used for management of network devices as they
   relate to the infrastructure but is not typically used for management
   of applications on that infrastructure.  The focus of SIP is
   applications and the performance management for those applications
   cannot rely on SNMP.  SNMP may be used to manage some aspects of the
   physical device aspects of the SIP user agent

   Specifically, SNMP may be used to manage the SIP user agent - the
   phone, soft phone or gateway.  However, the information available in
   RTCP summary reports is of less interest to the management of the UA
   and more of interest to the VoIP service provider.  In many cases,
   separate entities will be involved.  For example, an enterprise may
   manage their own SIP phones using SNMP, but a service provider
   provides SIP and gateway services.  It is unlikely a service provider
   will have SNMP privileges and may not be able to manage NAT/firewall
   traversal, etc.  For these reasons, SNMP is not a good fit for this
   "service level" management function.

5.  SIP Events Approach

   In this approach, a new SIP events package [6] is be defined.  The
   intended method to use for this event is PUBLISH [8], though it could



Johnston, et al.        Expires January 16, 2005                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           RTCP Summary Delivery                 July 2004


   also be used with SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY.  A VoIP application will
   PUBLISH performance data to a State Agent which will make the
   information available to other applications.

6.  Event Package Formal Definition

6.1  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [2].
   The event-package token name for this package is:

   "perfrpt"

6.2  Event Package Parameters

   No event package parameters are defined.

6.3  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   No SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.

6.4  Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

6.5  NOTIFY Bodies

   There are two notify bodies:  a general report and a threshold
   report.  The general report is used for periodic, mid-call reporting
   and end of call reporting.  The general report can include both local
   and remote metrics.

   The threshold report is used when call quality degrades.  The general
   report is also included in the alert report to provide all of the
   necessary diagnostic information.

   This specification defines a new MIME type application/rtcp-xr which
   is a text encoding of the RTCP-XR statistics, with the addition of a
   few additional identifiers.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [7].

6.6  Metric Definitions

          Codec Type
          The IANA defined audio codec value.

          Packetization Rate
          The rate, in milliseconds, at which the source audio is sampled.

   See RFC 3611 [4] for a full description of these metrics.


          Packet Loss Concealment
          Indicator of whether packet loss concealment is used.  When PLC
          = "std", or standard, then a simple replay or interpolation
          algorithm is being used to fill-in the missing packet; this
          approach is typically able to conceal isolated lost packets at
          low packet loss rates.  When PLC = "enh", or enhanced, then an
          enhanced interpolation algorithm is being used; algorithms of
          this type are able to conceal high packet loss rates
          effectively.  When PLC = "unk", then no information is available



Johnston, et al.        Expires January 16, 2005                [Page 7]

          concerning the use of PLC; however, for some codecs this may be
          inferred.

          Jitter Buffer Type
          Indicator of the jitter buffer is adaptive or static.  When the
          jitter buffer is adaptive, then its size is being dynamically
          adjusted to deal with varying levels of jitter.  When non-
          adaptive, the jitter buffer size is maintained at a fixed level.

          Jitter Buffer Rate
          This represents the implementation specific adjustment rate of a
          jitter buffer in adaptive mode.

          Jitter Buffer Nomimal Delay
          This is the current nominal jitter buffer delay in
          milliseconds, which corresponds to the nominal jitter buffer
          delay for packets that arrive exactly on time.  This parameter
          MUST be provided for both fixed and adaptive jitter buffer
          implementations.

          Jitter Buffer Maximum Delay
          This is the current maximum jitter buffer delay in milliseconds
          which corresponds to the earliest arriving packet that would
          not be discarded.  In simple queue implementations this may
          correspond to the nominal size.  In adaptive jitter buffer
          implementations, this value may dynamically vary up to JB abs
          max (see below).

          Jitter Buffer Absolute Maximum Delay
          This is the absolute maximum delay in milliseconds that the
          adaptive jitter buffer can reach under worst case conditions.
          If this value exceeds 65535 milliseconds, then this field SHALL
          convey the value 65535.  This parameter MUST be provided for
          adaptive jitter buffer implementations and its value MUST be
          set to JB maximum for fixed jitter buffer implementations.

          Packet Loss Ratio
          The fraction of packets lost within the network.

          Packet Discard Rate
          The fraction of packets discarded due to jitter

          Burst Density
          The fraction of packets lost and discarded within a
          burst (high loss rate) period.

          Burst Length (mS)
          The mean length of a burst.

Internet-Draft           RTCP Summary Delivery                 July 2004


          Gap Density
          The fraction of packets lost and discarded within a
          gap (low loss rate) period.

          Gap Length (mS)
          The mean length of a gap

          Round Trip Delay (mS)
          The round trip delay between RTP interfaces

          End System Round Trip Delay (mS)
          The "round trip" delay between the RTP interface and the
          analog or trunk interface.

          Signal Level (dBm)
          The signal level during talkspurts.

          Noise Level (dBm)
          The signal level during silence periods.

          Residual Echo Return Loss (dB)
          The residual (uncancelled) echo level from the analog or
          trunk interface.

          R -  Listening Quality
          Estimated listening call quality expressed in a score from
          0 - 100, per ITU-T standard G.107.

          R - Conversational Quality
          Estimated conversational call quality expressed in a
          score from
          0 - 100, per ITU-T standard G.107.

          MOS-LQ
          Estimated listening call quality expressed as a MOS score

          MOS-CQ
          Estimated conversational call quality expressed as a
          MOS score



6.7  Use of PUBLISH Method

   A VoIP application which supports this specification will publish
   performance report information using the PUBLISH method.  An
   application wishing to access this performance data maintains a State
   Agent for the perfrpt event package.  The Request-URI of the PUBLISH

   method is set to the AOR of the VoIP application.  The PUBLISH method
   is sent to the normal default outbound proxy server of the VoIP
   application.

   The State Agent can use normal mechanisms for publication throttling
   or rejection of the information as described in the PUBLISH [8]
   specification.

   This alert indicates that the quality of the call in progress has
   degraded to an unacceptable level.  In this case, the packet loss
   rate was 5%, the packet discard rate (due to jitter) was 2%, there
   were no bursts, the gap loss/discard rate was 2%, the round trip
   delay was 160mS, the end system delay was 140mS, the R factor was 85,
   the MOS-LQ 3.6, the MOS-CQ 3.5.  The remote metrics were available
   via RTCP XR [4 ] so they are also included in the event.

8.1  SIP Event Package Registration

      Package name: perfrpt

      Type: package

      Contact: Alan Johnston <alan.johnston@mci.com>

      Published Specification: This document

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: rtcp-xr

      Mandatory parameters: none

      Optional parameters: none

      Encoding considerations: text

      Security considerations: See next section.

      Interoperability considerations: none.

      Published specification: This document.


      Applications which use this media type: This document type is
           being used in notifications of VoIP quality reports.

      Additional Information:

           Magic Number: None

           File Extension: None

           Macintosh file type code: "TEXT"

9.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.

10.  Updates since -02

   - Removed discussion of alternative mechanisms

   - Changed from NOTIFY transport to PUBLISH transport.

   - Changed package name from "rtcp-xr" to "perfrpt"

   - Corrected call flows.

   - Minor updates to message body format.

   - Added IANA registration for perfrpt SIP Event Package and
   application/rtcp-xr MIME registration.

   - Added more discussion for motivation and reasons why SNMP is not
   suitable
