             Cross-layer Cooperation for Encrypted Traffic
               draft-chen-tsvwg-crosslayer-cooperation-00


Abstract

   This memo mainly considers the requirement and feasibility of cross-
   layer design in the encrypted traffic scenario. 

   By permitting the interaction between the encrypted application layer
   and non-encrypted transport/network layer, the network layer may
   schedule service flow more properly and the application layer may
   know the network status information well, which actually optimize the
   network bandwidth.

1. Introduction

   Implemented by OTT, the encrypted traffic is increasing on the
   Internet over the past few years and will continue to increase. This
   brings up the problem for the network operator to effectively manage
   the flows. The reason lies in that network devices(e.g router,
   firewall, DPI) controlled by Operator could not parse the flow
   contents sending by server/client controlled by OTT. Traffic
   encryption in fact hinders most existing bandwidth optimization
   methods.

   Seeing from the layering perspective, as shown in Figure.1, traffic
   encryption results in the application layer disconnection between OTT

   controlled devices and Operator controlled devices. 

   Cross-layer cooperation is one possible way to resolve the problem.
   It removes the strict boundaries between each layer to allow
   communication between them. For example, by permitting transport
   layer to access the data of application layer to exchange information
   and enable interaction, network devices is able to learn OTT
   information contents to implement bandwidth optimization.

2. Cross-layer Cooperation for Encrypted Traffic

   The problem with the encrypted traffic is the inaccessible of some
   useful information which required by operator to manage their
   networks. For example, without flow types and flow control
   information, network operator can not predict the traffic evolution
   in real time[Dadas].

   Information sharing between the encrypted part and non-encrypted part
   is vital to make the bandwidth optimization possible. As shown in
   Figure.2, it can be generalized to bidirectional interactive: (a)up

2.1 Up to down information sharing

   Through the interfaces the application layer opened up, it may send
   data down to network layer for network management benefits. The data
   can be one bit to indicate the encryption state or several bits to
   indicate the flow types and flow control information. The network
   device needs these information to determine in which way to deal with
   the flow. 


2.2 Down to up information sharing

   Through the interfaces the network layer opened up, it may send data
   up to the application layer for network management/optimization
   benefits. These data include some more detailed flow information
   required by the network devices. Then the application layer may share
   the required information with the transport layer or network layer to
   enable the fine-grained flow management. 

   For example, the network device may inform the server/client to share
   URL information included in flow content, in case that the flow be
   blocked by middle box as malicious traffic due to encryption.

3  Extended Discussion

   Cross-layer cooperation is useful in some other scenario in addition
   to traffic encryption scenario. Mobile video service is a good
   example with the emerging AR/VR technique. A more powerful network is
   demand to provide sufficient bandwidth and the wide dynamic range.

3.1 Mobile Video Scenario

   Existing TCP-based video streaming transmission is hard to meet the
   requirement, especially when experiencing a long RTT scenario or in
   the wireless scenario with high packet loss ratio. All these will
   result in an inefficient use of network bandwidth and thus seriously
   impact the user's experience.  

   Cross-layer cooperation may help to solve this problem and Figure.3
   shows some example of interactive among protocol layers: 


                      +-------------------+
                      | Application Layer +---+
                      +-------------------+   |
                                              |
                                              |
                      +-------------------+   |
                      |  Transport Layer  |   |
                      +-^---------------+-+   |
                        |               |     |
                        |               |     |

                        |               |     |
                        |               |     |
                        |               |     |
                      +-+---------------v-+   |

   Arrow(a) indicates that the network layer may share information with
   transport layer. Examples include ECN[ECN] and CQIC[CQIC]. By
   permitting transport layer to obtain the network layer information
   such as congestion state or bottleneck bandwidth information,
   bandwidth optimization can be achieved. 


   Arrow(b) indicates that the transport layer may share some

Internet-Draft          Cross-layer Cooperation               March 2016


   information with the network layer. Example could be accurate
   congestion notification. The transport layer will inform the network
   layer the type of information of interest. Then the network layer may
   provide these information to the transport layer according to certain
   in-band approach and thus enable the accurate congestion
   notification.

   Arrow(c) indicates that the application layer may share information
   with network layer. Typical example include Path Element
   Computing(PCE). For PCE, the application layer will compute the
   desired routing path and share this information with the network
   layer to enable the routing path optimization.

3.2 Future Discussion

   In the original OSI networking model, strict boundaries between
   layers are enforced, where data are kept strictly within a given
   layer. Cross-layer cooperation removes such strict boundaries to
   allow communication between layers. It permits one layer to access
   the data of another layer in certain way to exchange information and
   enable interaction. 

   With the fast-growing demand of high-bandwidth value-added services,
   network model itself need to evolve. Interactive network model which
   employs cross-layer cooperation should be take into consideration.
