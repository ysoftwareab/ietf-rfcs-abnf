              Summarizing Current Attacks on TLS and DTLS
                     draft-ietf-uta-tls-attacks-00

Abstract

   Over the last few years there have been several serious attacks on
   TLS, including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and modes of
   operation.  This document summarizes these attacks, with the goal of
   motivating generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage
   of TLS and DTLS.

1.  Introduction

   Over the last few years there have been several major attacks on TLS
   [RFC5246], including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and
   modes of operation.  Details are given in Section 2, but suffice it
   to say that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most
   current usage, have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.

   This situation motivated the creation of the UTA working group, which
   is tasked with the creation of generic and protocol-specific
   recommendation for the use of TLS and DTLS.

   "Attacks always get better; they never get worse" (ironically, this
   saying is attributed to the NSA).  This list of attacks describes our
   knowledge as of this writing.  It seems likely that new attacks will
   be invented in the future.

   For a more detailed discussion of the attacks listed here, the
   interested reader is referred to [Attacks-iSec].

2.  Attacks on TLS

   This section lists the attacks that motivated the current
   recommendations.  This is not intended to be an extensive survey of
   TLS's security.

Internet-Draft                 TLS Attacks                    March 2014


   While there are widely deployed mitigations for some of the attacks
   listed below, we believe that their root causes necessitate a more
   systemic solution.

2.1.  BEAST

   The BEAST attack [BEAST] uses issues with the TLS 1.0 implementation
   of CBC (that is, the predictable initialization vector) to decrypt
   parts of a packet, and specifically shows how this can be used to
   decrypt HTTP cookies when run over TLS.

2.2.  Lucky Thirteen

   A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design in all current versions
   of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks [Padding-Oracle].
   A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen attack
   [CBC-Attack], a timing side-channel attack that allows the attacker
   to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.

2.3.  Attacks on RC4

   The RC4 algorithm [RC4] has been used with TLS (and previously, SSL)
   for many years.  Attacks have also been known for a long time, e.g.
   [RC4-Attack-FMS].  But recent attacks ([RC4-Attack],
   [RC4-Attack-AlF]) have weakened this algorithm even more.  See
   [I-D.popov-tls-prohibiting-rc4] for more details.

2.4.  Compression Attacks: CRIME and BREACH

   The CRIME attack [CRIME] allows an active attacker to decrypt
   cyphertext (specifically, cookies) when TLS is used with protocol-
   level compression.

   The TIME attack [TIME] and the later BREACH attack [BREACH] both make
   similar use of HTTP-level compression to decrypt secret data passed
   in the HTTP response.  We note that compression of the HTTP message
   body is much more prevalent than compression at the TLS level.

   The former attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS compression, as
   recommended below.  We are not aware of mitigations at the protocol
   level to the latter attack, and so application-level mitigations are
   needed (see [BREACH]).  For example, implementations of HTTP that use
   CSRF tokens will need to randomize them even when the recommendations
   of [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp] are adopted.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document describes protocol attacks in an informational manner,
   and in itself does not have any security implications.  Its companion
   documents certainly do.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.

5.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank Stephen Farrell, Simon Josefsson, Yoav Nir,
   Kenny Paterson, Patrick Pelletier, and Rich Salz for their review of
   a previous version of this document.
