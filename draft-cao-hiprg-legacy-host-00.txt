       Communication between a HIP-enabled Host and a Legacy Host
                     draft-cao-hiprg-legacy-host-00

Abstract

   This document describes a way to support a HIP-enabled host to have
   the ability to communicate with legacy hosts.  By leveraging a proxy
   to bridge the communication between HIP host and non-HIP hosts, this
   document does not need the extensions to the HIP protocol.

Internet-Draft               HIP Legacy Host                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   HIP protocol [RFC5201] establishes an IP-layer communications context
   (called HIP association) between two hosts prior to communications.
   It also defines a packet format and procedures for updating an active
   HIP association.  HIP offers many well-defined features to end hosts
   such as security, integrity protection, mobility and multi-homing.

   HIP was designed to work with unmodified applications[RFC5338].  To
   ease incremental deployment, it is important to support the
   transition of legacy hosts towards HIP-enabled host.  In the first
   phrase of this transition, some legacy hosts are turning on their
   abilities to support HIP, but most of them, especially internet
   servers have not been HIP-aware.  There should be a mechanism that
   supports a HIP-enable host to communicate with non-HIP enabled legacy
   hosts.

   [I-D.melen-hip-proxy] defines HIP protocol extensions that allow a
   non-HIP host to use the services of a HIP-aware proxy node and have
   capabilities to communicate with a HIP host.
   [I-D.irtf-hiprg-proxies] investigates the HIP proxies for both
   directions.  The scenario introduced in this document is slightly
   different in that the proxy is located in the local network when
   serving the HIP host to communicate with the non-HIP host.

   This document describes a way to support a HIP-enabled host to have
   the ability to communicate with legacy hosts.  By leveraging a proxy
   to bridge the communication between HIP host and non-HIP hosts, this
   document does not need the extensions to the HIP protocol.

2.  Proposed Mechanism

2.1.  Overview

   In [I-D.melen-hip-proxy], HIP-proxy generates a Host Identity for
   each legacy host it will represent in the network.  Instead of
   creating a static identity for each legacy host, this document
   specifies a mechanism of proxy dynamically assigning a host identity
   for each non-HIP host.  The proxy will serve as the end point of the
   HIP base exchange.  After the HIP association is established, the
   proxy will be in charge of translation between the HIP packet and
   legacy IP packets.  The proxy will encapsulates the HIP packet
   payload into the IP header, so that the non-HIP host will participate
   into the communicate as usual.  [I-D.irtf-hiprg-proxies]

   This solution does not introduce any HIP protocol extention.  The
   proxy that intercepts the communication will take the responsibility
   of holding the communication.  Both the HIP aware initiator and non-
   HIP responder will be kept transparent about the proxy.

   Most applications translate the domain name into one of more IP
   addresses before data plane communication.  HIP is no exception.  The
   HIP-enabled host first launches the DNS query to retrieve the remote
   host's HI/HIT or RVS address.  Without knowing if the remote host
   supports HIP-based exchange, the HIP host is expecting to receiving
   the remote host HIP based Identities.

   The proxy, which intercepts the DNS query, will iteratively forward
   the query to the global DNS to find an answer.  If the responder is
   HIP enabled, it will have its HI or HIT registered in the DNS and the
   proxy will get an answer.  However, if the responder is not HIP
   aware, and only have type A or AAAA records in the DNS system, the
   query for QTYPE=HIP will fail.  On detecting that the responder is
   not HIP aware, the DNS proxy will use a temporary HI/HIT (T-ID)
   generated locally and reply this temporary HI/HIT to the initiator.
   The proxy will associate the T-ID with the IP address of the
   responder.  After the HIP RR query reponse, the Type-A query response
   is followed, via which the initiator get the the IP address of the
   proxy node.

   The HIP base exchange will proceed between the initiator and the
   proxy (step.5-8).  Then, the HIP association is established between
   the initiator and the proxy, i.e., between the host's HI and the
   temporary HI assigned to the reponder by the proxy.  If the initiator
   starts data communication towards the responder, the proxy on the
   data path will be responsible for the tranlation between HIP packets
   and IP packets.  First, the proxy will de-capsulate the packet and
   decrypte the packet to get the original IP packet inside.  By
   inspecting the HIP header after the IP header, the proxy is aware of
   the destination's HIT/LSI.  If the HIT and LSI is mapped to one of
   the responder's IP address, the proxy will translate the packet with
   the destination address as the responder's IP address, and source
   address as the proxy IP address.  The destination port is kept
   unchanged, but the source port can be dynamically assigned.
