Abstract 
    
   This document defines procedures for fast reroute protection of  
   Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths  
   (TE-LSP) in  MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks, based  
   upon Point-To-MultiPoint bypass tunnels. The motivation for using   
   P2MP bypass tunnels is to avoid potentially expensive data   
   duplication along the backup path that could occur if point-to-point  
   bypass tunnels where used, i.e. to optimize the bandwidth usage,  
   during fast reroute protection of a link or a node. During link or  
   node failure the traffic carried onto a protected P2MP TE-LSP is  
   tunnelled within one or several P2MP bypass tunnels towards a set of  
   Merge Points. To avoid data duplication backup labels (i.e. inner  
   labels) are assigned by the Point of Local Repair (PLR) following the  
   RSVP-TE upstream label assignment procedure.

1. Terminology 
 
   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC3031], [RFC3209], 
   [RFC4090] and [RFC4461]. It defines the following new terms: 
 
   P2MP Bypass tunnel: Point-to-Multipoint Bypass Tunnel. A P2MP TE- 
   LSP that is used to protect a set of P2MP TE-LSPs traversing a    
   common facility (link or node).  
    
   P2MP Facility Backup: A local repair method in which a P2MP bypass    
   tunnel is used to protect one or more P2MP TE-LSPs that  
   traverse the Point of Local Repair (P2MP Bypass Ingress) and the 
   resource being protected.  
 
   Backup P2MP LSP: The LSP that is used to backup up one of the    
   many protected P2MP LSPs in P2MP Facility Backup. 
    
   Backup S2L sub-LSP: A S2L sub-LSP of a backup P2MP LSP. 
    
   PLR: Point of Local Repair: Head-end LSR of the bypass tunnel 
    
   MP: Merge Point: LSR where a primary LSP and its backup LSP merge. 
 
                        . 
2. Introduction 
    
   [RFC4090] defines fast reroute extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] for 
   local protection of Point-To-Point (P2P) Traffic Engineered Label 
   Switched Paths (TE LSP) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) 
   networks. Two techniques are defined: the one-to-one backup method, 
   which creates a detour LSP for each protected LSP at each point of 
   local repair (PLR), and the facility backup method, which creates a 
   bypass tunnel that can be used to protect a set of TE LSPs by taking 
   advantage of MPLS label stacking. 
    
   [RSVP-P2MP] defines extensions to RSVP-TE for setting up Point-To- 
   Multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs. It specifies extensions to one-to-one and  
   facility backup Fast Reroute procedures defined in [RFC4090] so as to  
   support fast reroute protection of P2MP TE LSPs.  
   The facility backup solution defined in [RSVP-P2MP] only relies on 
   P2P bypass tunnels for link and node protection. This faces the 
   following limitations:  
    
        - The protection of a downstream link of a P2MP TE LSP on a  
        branch LSR may require a P2P Bypass LSP that uses another 
        downstream link of the P2MP LSP, and this leads to twice the 
        traffic on that link during failure, which is inefficient. 
        Finding a bypass path that avoids all downstream links on the 
        P2MP LSP would be a solution but this is often not achievable in 
        lowly meshed topologies.

        - The protection of a P2MP TE LSP against node failures  
        requires, when the protected node is a Branch LSR, a set of P2P 
        Next-Next-Hop (NNHOP) Bypass tunnels toward all LSRs downstream 
        to the  protected node. During failure the PLR has to replicate 
        traffic on each P2P NNHOP bypass tunnel. If there are K next-
        next-hops, this may lead to K times the traffic on some links,  
        which is not acceptable (as K is of the order of magnitude of  
        the squared node degree).  
         
        - Similarly the protection of a P2MP TE LSP against the failure  
        of a LAN interface that connects a branch LSR and a set of K  
        downstream LSRs requires one P2P bypass tunnel per downstream  
        LSR, which may lead to K times the traffic on some links during  
        failure. 
         
   To overcome these limitations it is highly desirable to define 
   extensions to the fast reroute facility backup solution, so as to 
   support P2MP bypass tunnels. This retains the scalability advantages 
   of MPLS label stacking and avoids sending multiple copies of a packet 
   on some links during failure. 
 
   This draft specifies extensions to the Fast ReRoute (FRR) procedures 
   defined in [RFC4090] and [RSVP-P2MP] to support local repair of P2MP 
   TE LSP with P2MP bypass tunnels.  
 
   Procedures defined in [RFC3209], [RFC4090] and [RSVP-P2MP] MUST be 
   followed unless specified below. 
 
3. Solution overview 
    
   The P2MP Facility Backup method defined in this document relies on 
   the use of P2MP bypass tunnels. Similarly to the P2P case, the same 
   P2MP bypass tunnel can be used to protect a set of P2MP TE LSPs, by 
   taking advantage of MPLS label stacking.  
 
   A P2MP Bypass tunnel can be used to protect a P2MP TE-LSP against 
   downstream link or node failures. There are various options for the 
   protection of a downstream link or node: 
    
        - Rely on a single P2MP bypass tunnel whose leaf LSRs exactly 
           matches the set of Merge Points (MP). Merge points are 
           transit or egress LSRs on the protected P2MP LSP downstream 
           to the PLR or downstream to the protected element (link or 
           node). 
        - Rely on a single P2MP Bypass tunnel whose set of leaf LSRs is 
           a superset of the set of MPs. Leaf LSRs which are not MP have 
           to drop the traffic. 
        - Rely on a combination of P2MP bypass LSPs whose leaf LSRs are 
           a subset of the set of MP but there combination encompass all 
           MPs.  
    
 
Le Roux, et al.                                               [Page 4] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-leroux-mpls-p2mp-te-bypass-01.txt     March 2007 


   These three options differ in terms of bandwidth optimization and 
   control plane state minimization. Option 1 increases the number of 
   states compared to option 2 (it implies more P2MP bypass LSPs), but 
   is less expensive in terms of bandwidth (traffic only sent to MPs).  
   With point-to-multipoint hierarchy there is always a tension between 
   minimizing the amount of control plane state and minimizing bandwidth 
   consumption. Choosing one of these options is a decision local to the 
   PLR. The choice depends on the desired trade-off between control 
   plane and data plane optimization, and the operational complexity 
   associated with the different options.  
    
   When the P2MP facility backup method is used, during failure the PLR 
   MUST send data for each protected P2MP LSP into the set of one or 
   more P2MP bypass tunnel. Label stacking is used: the inner label is 
   the backup label for the backup P2MP LSP, that will be used on the MP 
   to forward traffic to the corresponding protected P2MP LSP, and the 
   outer label is the P2MP bypass tunnel label. 
 
   To avoid data replication on the PLR, the same backup label MUST be 
   used for all S2L sub-LSPs of a given backup P2MP LSP, tunneled within 
   the same P2MP bypass tunnel. This backup label will indicate to the 
   Merge Points that packets received with that label should be switched 
   along the protected P2MP LSP.   
    
   For that purpose upstream label assignment procedures defined in 
   [MPLS-UPSTREAM] and RSVP-TE extensions for upstream label assignment 
   defined in [RSVP-UP] MUST be used. To signal a backup P2MP LSP, the 
   same backup label, is distributed by the PLR to all MPs belonging to 
   a same P2MP Bypass tunnel, in the context of this P2MP bypass tunnel. 
   This requires the backup P2MP LSP to be signalled prior to the 
   failure.  
 
   On the MP, backup S2L sub-LSPs (i.e. S2L sub-LSPs of the backup P2MP 
   LSP) are merged with protected S2L sub-LSPs. A MP (i.e. the bypass 
   tunnel leaf LSRs), maintains a context specific ILM for the P2MP 
   Bypass tunnel. This can be implemented by maintaining a different 
   context specific ILM for each LSR that is the root of a P2MP Bypass 
   tunnel, or by maintaining a different context specific ILM for each 
   P2MP Bypass tunnel. The context of an inner label (i.e a backup label) 
   is determined by the underlying P2MP bypass tunnel on which it is 
   received. This requires deactivating PHP on the P2MP bypass tunnel. A 
   label, in a given Bypass tunnel specific ILM, is mapped to the 
   outgoing interface(s) and label(s) of the corresponding protected 
   P2MP LSP.

4. PLR procedures 
 
4.1. Before failure 
    
4.1.1. P2MP Bypass Tunnel(s) Selection 
 
   To protect a P2MP TE LSP against a downstream link or node failure, a 
   PLR MUST select a set of one or more P2MP bypass tunnel(s), denoted 
   {B1.Bm}, as follows: 
         
        - The bypass tunnel(s) MUST NOT traverse the protected  
        link/node/SRLG. 
    
        - The set of leaf LSRs of bypass tunnels {B1.Bm}, denoted {LSR1. 
        LSRn} must include a set of Merge Points (MP), on the protected 
        P2MP LSP. These Merge Points are transit or egress LSRs on the 
        protected P2MP LSP downstream to the PLR or downstream to the 
        protected element (link or node). We will denote this set of 
        Merge Points as {MP1.MPq}. Note that the case where some MPs are  
        LSRs downstream to the PLR but not downstream to the failed 
        element allows avoiding sending twice the traffic on downstream 
        links during failure. 
         
        - In the event of failure of the protected link or node, traffic  
        received on the protected P2MP LSP by the PLR, can be delivered  
        to all the leaves of the protected P2MP LSP downstream to the  
        PLR, if it is tunnelled to {MP1.MPq} over the set of one or more  
        P2MP bypass tunnel(s) {B1.Bm}. 
    
   The PLR will assign upstream labels to Merge Points {MP1.MPq} for the 
   backup P2MP LSP. The same backup label will be assigned to all Merge 
   Points belonging to the same P2MP Bypass tunnel. 
    
   A MP may actually be leaf LSR of multiple bypass tunnels, but will be 
   associated to only one bypass tunnel. That is a PLR will signal the 
   P2MP backup LSP to that MP, for a single P2MP bypass tunnel context.  
 
   {LSR1.LSRn} may be a superset of {MP1.MPq}, that is some leaf LSRs of 
   a given P2MP bypass tunnel, noted {LSRx.LSRy}, may not belong to 
   {MP1.MPq}. The PLR will not assign upstream labels for the backup 
   P2MP LSP to these LSRs {LSRx.LSRy}. During failure packets with a 
   backup label will also be delivered onto the P2MP bypass tunnel to 
   {LSRx.LSRy} which will discard these packets based on no entry for 
   this label in the context specific ILM for that bypass tunnel. This 
   requires that {LSRx.LSRy} create a context specific ILM for that 
   bypass tunnel.

Internet Draft  draft-leroux-mpls-p2mp-te-bypass-01.txt     March 2007 


   PHP MUST be deactivated on the P2MP Bypass tunnel, in order to allow 
   MPs to determine the context for the backup labels assigned by the 
   PLR. 
    
   Note that P2MP bypass LSPs may be signalled in advance either 
   automatically or via configuration, or may be dynamically setup upon 
   protected P2MP LSP signalling. Such procedures rely on local 
   implementation issues and are beyond the scope of this document. 
 
    
4.1.2. P2MP Backup LSP Signalling 
 
   The same backup label (i.e. the inner label) MUST be used for all 
   backup S2L sub-LSPs which are tunneled within the same P2MP Bypass 
   tunnel, so as to avoid traffic replication on the PLR. This label 
   MUST be assigned by the PLR using upstream label assignment 
   procedures. 
 
   Backup P2MP LSPs MUST be signaled prior to the failure. To signal the 
   backup P2MP LSP, the PLR will send one or more Path messages, 
   referred to as a backup LSP's Path message, to each MP, as specified 
   in [RSVP-P2MP]. A backup LSP's Path message to a given MP comprises 
   one or more backup S2L sub-LSPs that transit through this MP.  
   A backup Path message MUST be sent to the MP using directed 
   signaling; i.e., it is addressed to the MP, without Router Alert 
   option. 
    
   As specified in [RSVP-P2MP] it is RECOMMENDED that the PLR use the 
   sender template specific method to identify a backup LSP's Path 
   message, that is, the PLR will set the source address in the sender 
   template to a local PLR address.  
    
   The backup label MUST be assigned by the PLR, in the context of the 
   underlying P2MP Bypass tunnel, following upstream label assignment 
   and P2MP RSVP-TE context identification procedures defined in [RSVP-
   UP]. Hence, a backup LSP's Path message sent to a given MP MUST 
   include an Upstream Assigned Label object carrying the value of the 
   backup label. It MUST also include an RSVP-TE P2MP LSP TLV within an 
   IF_ID RSVP object, that carries the session object of the underlying 
   P2MP Bypass tunnel. This allows the MP to identify the label space of 
   the backup label assigned by the PLR. The same backup label MUST be 
   sent to all MPs belonging to a given P2MP Bypass tunnel. 
    
   Note that the PLR MUST continue to refresh Path messages for the 
   protected P2MP TE LSP along the nominal route. 
 
   The processing of backup S2L sub-LSP SEROs/SRROs MUST follow  
   backup LSP ERO/RRO processing described in [RFC4090].

Internet Draft  draft-leroux-mpls-p2mp-te-bypass-01.txt     March 2007 


4.2. During failure 
    
   When the PLR detects a link or/and node failure condition, it has to 
   reroute a protected P2MP LSP onto a set of one or more P2MP bypass 
   tunnels using as inner label(s) the backup label(s) assigned for this 
   P2MP LSP. 
    
   Note that when some MPs are LSRs downstream to the PLR but not 
   downstream to the failed element, the PLR MUST stop sending traffic 
   directly within the protected P2MP TE LSP towards these MPs. This 
   allows avoiding sending twice the traffic on downstream links during 
   failure. 
 
   The PLR MUST continue to send Path messages for the backup P2MP LSP.  
   The RRO/ERO flags MUST be updated as per defined in [RFC4090] 
 
5. MP Procedures 
 
   A MP receives one or more Path messages for the protected P2MP TE LSP 
   and one or more Path messages for the backup P2MP LSP. 
    
   Note that, as specified in [RFC4090], the reception of a backup LSP's 
   Path message does not indicate that a failure has occurred or that 
   the incoming protected LSP will no longer be used. 
    
   A S2L sub-LSP is received within a Path message for the protected 
   P2MP LSP and within a Path message for the backup P2MP LSP. These two 
   Path messages are distinguished thanks to the sender-template 
   specific method. As specified in [RFC4090], each of these Path 
   messages will have a different sender address. The protected LSP can 
   be recognized because it will include the FAST_REROUTE object or have 
   the "local protection desired" flag set in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE 
   object, or both. 
 
   A MP MUST maintain one context specific ILM table per PLR or per P2MP 
   bypass tunnel for which it is a leaf.  
    
   A MP MUST install the upstream assigned label received in a backup 
   LSP's Path message, within an ILM specific to the underlying bypass 
   tunnel, which is identified by its session object, carried within the 
   IF_ID RSVP_HOP object of the backup LSP's Path message. An upstream 
   assigned label for a backup P2MP LSP MUST be mapped to the outgoing 
   interface(s) and label(s) of the corresponding protected P2MP LSP. 
    
   As specified in [RSVP-UP], the Resv message sent by a MP to the PLR, 
   does not carry any Label Object. 
 
   The processing of backup S2L sub-LSP SEROs/SRROs MUST follow  
   backup tunnel ERO/RRO processing described in [RFC4090].

6. To be included in future revisions 
    
   The following items will be included in further revisions of this 
   document: 
    
        - Combination of P2P and P2MP bypass tunnels to protect a given  
          link/node. This will allow backward compatibility with LSRs  
          that do not support upstream label assignment. 
    
        - Cases where the PLR is not directly upstream to the protected   
          element. 
    
        - Partial protection: that is the case where only a subset of  
          Merge Points can be covered. 
    
        - New RSPV-TE Attribute flags: 
    
             o A flag in the ATTRIBUTE FLAGS TLV to indicate that  
               protection with P2MP bypass tunnels is desired, and to  
               record such protection. 
             o A flag in the ATTRIBUTE FLAGS TLV to indicate whether 
                partial protection is allowed or not and to record 
                partial protection. 
             o A flag in the ATTRIBUTE FLAGS TLV to indicate that PHP 
                must be deactivated, and to record PHP status (this has 
                a broader scope so this may belong to a dedicated 
                draft).
