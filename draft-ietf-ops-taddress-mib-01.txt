Abstract

   This document introduces a MIB module which defines textual
   conventions to represent commonly used transport layer addressing
   information.  The definitions are compatible with the concept of
   TAddress/TDomain pairs introduced by the SMIv2 and support the
   Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.

Internet-Draft         TCs for Transport Addresses        September 2001


1. Introduction

   Many MIB modules have the need to represent transport layer addresses
   in a generic way.  Typical examples are MIBs for application
   protocols that can run over several different transports or
   application management MIBs that need to model generic communication
   endpoints.

   The SMIv2 defines in RFC 2579 [7] the textual conventions TDomain and
   TAddress to represent generic transports layer endpoints.  A generic
   TAddress value is interpreted in a given transport domain which is
   identified by a TDomain value.  The TDomain is an object identifier
   which allows MIB authors to extend the set of supported transport
   domains by providing suitable definitions in enterprise specific MIB
   modules.

   A set of TDomain values and concrete TAddress formats has been
   standardized in RFC 1906 [11].  These definitions are however mixed
   up with SNMP semantics and definitions for Internet transport
   protocols over IPv4 and IPv6 are missing.

   The purpose of this memo is to introduce a set of well-known textual
   conventions to represent commonly used transport layer addressing
   information which is compatible with the original TDomain and
   TAddress approach and which includes definitions for Internet
   transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.  This memo also defines a new
   textual convention which enumerates the well-known transport domains
   since such an enumeration provides in many cases enough flexibility
   and is more efficient compared to object identifiers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [6], STD 58, RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The

Internet-Draft         TCs for Transport Addresses        September 2001


      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC
      1906 [11].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574
      [13].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [14].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [16].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3. Overview

   This MIB module contains definitions for commonly used transport
   layer addressing information.  In particular, it provides the
   following definitions:

   1.  Textual conventions for generic transport addresses and generic
       transport domains.

   2.  Object identifier registrations for well-known transport domains.

   3.  An enumeration of the well-known transport domains, called a
       transport address type.

Internet-Draft         TCs for Transport Addresses        September 2001


   4.  A set of textual conventions for the address formats used by
       well-known transport domains.

   It is expected that this MIB module will be updated by subsequent
   RFCs which register additional well-known transport domains and which
   introduce new textual conventions for the address formats used by
   those new transport domains.

   This module does NOT define the transport mappings of any particular
   protocol.  Rather, it defines a set of common identifiers and textual
   conventions that are intended to be used within various transport
   mappings documents.

3.1 Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section discusses how the definitions provided by this memo
   relate to definitions in related MIB modules.

3.1.1 SNMPv2-TC (TAddress, TDomain)

   The SNMPv2-TC module [7] defines the textual conventions TAddress and
   TDomain to represent generic transport addresses.

   A TAddress is an octet string with a size between 1 and 255 octets.
   Experience has shown that there is sometimes a need to represent
   unknown transport addresses.  This module therefore introduces a new
   textual convention TransportAddress which is an octet string with a
   size between 0 and 255 octets and otherwise identical semantics.

   This module also introduces a new textual convention TransportDomain
   which is compatible with the TDomain definition so that a complete
   set of definitions is contained in a single module.

3.1.2 SNMPv2-TM

   The transport domains defined in the SNMPv2-TM module [11] all
   contain "snmp" as the prefix in their name and are registered under
   `snmpDomains' (from RFC 2578 [6]).  There has been some confusion as
   to whether these definitions are appropriate for designating
   transport endpoints for non-SNMP traffic.  These definitions are also
   incomplete since new transport address domains are needed to support
   (at least) SNMP over IPv6.

3.1.3 INET-ADDRESS-MIB (InetAddressType, InetAddress)

   The INET-ADDRESS-MIB module [18] defines the textual conventions
   InetAddressType and InetAddress to represent Internet network layer
   endpoints.  Several MIBs use these textual conventions in conjunction

Internet-Draft         TCs for Transport Addresses        September 2001


   with the InetPortNumber textual convention to represent Internet
   transport layer endpoints.  This is approach is fine as long as a MIB
   models protocols or applications that are specific to the Internet
   suite of transport protocols.  For protocols or applications that can
   potentially use other transport protocols, the use of the definitions
   contained in this memo is more appropriate.

6. Security Considerations

   The MIB module contained in this memo does not define any management
   objects.  Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may
   be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB
   modules that define concrete management objects.  This document has
   therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.

7. Acknowledgments

   This document was produced by the Operations and Management Area
   "IPv6MIB" design team.  Some of the definitions in this module are
   taken from RFC 1906 [11].  The authors would like to thank Mark
   Ellison, Brian Haberman, Erik Nordmark, Bill Strahm and Dave Thaler
   for their comments and suggestions.

8. Intellectual Property Notice

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
   Director.

Appendix A. Open Issues

   1.  Provide suitable transport domain and address format definitions
       for DNS names, e.g.  www.tu-bs.de:80?

   2.  This version adopts a URL format wherever possible, e.g.
       10.1.2.3:80 instead of 10.1.2.3/80 for IPv4 and
       [00:00:00:00:0A:01:02:03]:80 instead of
       00:00:00:00:0A:01:02:03/80 for IPv6 (RFC 2732).  Is this useful?
       Are the DISPLAY-HINTs to achieve the desired output format
       acceptable?

   3.  Need to find experts to review the TC definitions for protocols
       we are not familiar with (TransportAddressOSI,
       TransportAddressNBP, TransportAddressIPX).  Remove the TCs if no
       expert can be found.

   4.  Add references and REFERENCE clauses for the various address
       formats? Probably copying stuff from RFC 1906? Are the references
       in RFC 1906 still valid?

   5.  Shall we add more explicit guidelines and examples for the usage
       of the TransportAddressType TC, similar to what is in the INET-
       ADDRESS-MIB document?

   6.  Support for SCTP? How does it work with SCTP failover?

   7.  Should we give guidance when to use the RFC 1906 definitions and
       when to use the definitions provided by this memo?

   8.  Any ideas for a better descriptor prefix to be used throughout
       this MIB module?
