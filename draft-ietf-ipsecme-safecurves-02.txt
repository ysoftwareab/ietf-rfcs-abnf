1.  Introduction

   The "Elliptic Curves for Security" document [RFC7748] describes two
   elliptic curves: Curve25519 and Curve448, as well as the X25519 and
   X448 functions for performing key agreement (Diffie-Hellman)
   operations with these curves.  The curves and functions are designed
   for both performance and security.

   Almost ten years ago the "ECP Groups for IKE and IKEv2" document
   [RFC4753] specified the first elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman groups
   for the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKEv2 - [RFC7296]).  These
   were the so-called NIST curves.  The state of the art has advanced
   since then.  More modern curves allow faster implementations while
   making it much easier to write constant-time implementations free
   from time-based side-channel attacks.  This document defines two such
   curves for use in IKE.  See [Curve25519] for details about the speed
   and security of the Curve25519 function.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Curve25519 & Curve448

   All cryptographic computations are done using the X25519 and X448
   functions defined in [RFC7748].  All related parameters (for example,
   the base point) and the encoding (in particular, pruning the least/
   most significant bits and use of little-endian encoding) are
   inherited from [RFC7748].

Internet-Draft      Curve25519 and Curve448 for IKEv2        August 2016


   An ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519 or Curve448
   goes as follows: Each party picks a secret key d uniformly at random
   and computes the corresponding public key.  "X" is used below to
   denote either X25519 or X448, and "G" is used to denote the
   corresponding base point:

      pub_mine = X(d, G)

   Parties exchange their public keys (see Section 3.1) and compute a
   shared secret:

         SHARED_SECRET = X(d, pub_peer).

   This shared secret is used directly as the value denoted g^ir in
   section 2.14 of RFC 7296.  It is 32 octets when Curve25519 is used,
   and 56 octets when Curve448 is used.

3.  Use and Negotiation in IKEv2

   The use of Curve25519 and Curve448 in IKEv2 is negotiated using a
   Transform Type 4 (Diffie-Hellman group) in the SA payload of either
   an IKE_SA_INIT or a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange.  The value TBA1 is used
   for the group defined by Curve25519 and the value TBA2 is used for
   the group defined by Curve448.

   The diagram for the Key Exchange Payload from section 3.4 of RFC 7296
   is copied below for convenience:

   o  Payload Length - For Curve25519 the public key is 32 octets, so
      the Payload Length field will be 40, and for Curve448 the public
      key is 56 octets, so the Payload Length field will be 64.
   o  The Diffie-Hellman Group Num is TBA1 for Curve25519, or TBA2 for
      Curve448.

   o  The Key Exchange Data is the 32 or 56 octets as described in
      section 6 of [RFC7748]

3.2.  Recipient Tests

   This document matches the discussion in [RFC7748] related to
   receiving and accepting incompatible point formats.  In particular,
   receiving entities MUST mask the most-significant bit in the final
   byte for X25519 (but not X448), and implementations MUST accept non-
   canonical values.  See section 5 of [RFC7748] for further discussion.

4.  Security Considerations

   Curve25519 and Curve448 are designed to facilitate the production of
   high-performance constant-time implementations.  Implementors are
   encouraged to use a constant-time implementation of the functions.
   This point is of crucial importance if the implementation chooses to
   reuse its supposedly ephemeral key pair for many key exchanges, which
   some implementations do in order to improve performance.

   Curve25519 is intended for the ~128-bit security level, comparable to
   the 256-bit random ECP group (group 19) defined in RFC 4753, also
   known as NIST P-256 or secp256r1.  Curve448 is intended for the
   ~224-bit security level.

   While the NIST curves are advertised as being chosen verifiably at
   random, there is no explanation for the seeds used to generate them.
   In contrast, the process used to pick these curves is fully
   documented and rigid enough so that independent verification has been
   done.  This is widely seen as a security advantage, since it prevents
   the generating party from maliciously manipulating the parameters.

   Another family of curves available in IKE, generated in a fully
   verifiable way, is the Brainpool curves [RFC6954].  For example,
   brainpoolP256 (group 28) is expected to provide a level of security
   comparable to Curve25519 and NIST P-256.  However, due to the use of
   pseudo-random prime, it is significantly slower than NIST P-256,
   which is itself slower than Curve25519.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign two values from the IKEv2 "Transform Type
   4 - Diffie-Hellman Group Transform IDs" registry, with names
   "Curve25519" and "Curve448" and this document as reference.  The
   Recipient Tests field should also point to this document.

Appendix A.  Numerical Example for Curve25519

   Suppose we have both the initiator and the responder generating
   private keys by generating 32 random octets.  As usual in IKEv2 and
   its extension, we will denote Initiator values with the suffix _i and
   responder values with the suffix _r:

     random_i = 75 1f b4 30 86 55 b4 76 b6 78 9b 73 25 f9 ea 8c
                dd d1 6a 58 53 3f f6 d9 e6 00 09 46 4a 5f 9d 94

     random_r = 0a 54 64 52 53 29 0d 60 dd ad d0 e0 30 ba cd 9e
                55 01 ef dc 22 07 55 a1 e9 78 f1 b8 39 a0 56 88

   These numbers need to be fixed by unsetting some bits as described in
   section 5 of RFC 7748.  This affects only the first and last octets
   of each value:

     fixed_i =  70 1f b4 30 86 55 b4 76 b6 78 9b 73 25 f9 ea 8c
                dd d1 6a 58 53 3f f6 d9 e6 00 09 46 4a 5f 9d 54

     fixed_r =  08 54 64 52 53 29 0d 60 dd ad d0 e0 30 ba cd 9e
                55 01 ef dc 22 07 55 a1 e9 78 f1 b8 39 a0 56 48

   The actual private keys are considered to be encoded in little-endian
   format:

  d_i = 549D5F4A460900E6D9F63F53586AD1DD8CEAF925739B78B676B4558630B41F70

  d_r = 4856A039B8F178E9A1550722DCEF01559ECDBA30E0D0ADDD600D295352645408

   The public keys are generated from this using the formula in
   Section 2:

   pub_i = X25519(d_i, G) =
                48 d5 dd d4 06 12 57 ba 16 6f a3 f9 bb db 74 f1
                a4 e8 1c 08 93 84 fa 77 f7 90 70 9f 0d fb c7 66

   pub_r = X25519(d_r, G) =
                0b e7 c1 f5 aa d8 7d 7e 44 86 62 67 32 98 a4 43
                47 8b 85 97 45 17 9e af 56 4c 79 c0 ef 6e ee 25

   And this is the value of the Key Exchange Data field in the key
   exchange payload described in Section 3.1.  The shared value is
   calculated as in Section 2:

   SHARED_SECRET = X25519(d_i, pub_r) = X25519(d_r, pub_i) =
                c7 49 50 60 7a 12 32 7f-32 04 d9 4b 68 25 bf b0
                68 b7 f8 31 9a 9e 37 08-ed 3d 43 ce 81 30 c9 50
