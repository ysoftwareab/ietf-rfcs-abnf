1.  Introduction

   The current GMPLS routing [RFC7138] and signalling [RFC7139]
   extensions support the control of OTN signals and capabilities that
   were defined in the 2012 version of G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2012].

   In 2016 a new version of G.709 was published: [ITU-T_G709_2016].
   This version introduces new higher rate OTU and ODU signals, termed
   OTUCn and ODUCn respectively, which have a nominal rate of n x 100
   Gbit/s.  According to the definition in [ITU-T_G709_2016], OTUCn and
   ODUCn perform only section layer role and ODUCn supports only ODUk
   clients.  This document focuses on the use of existing GMPLS
   mechanisms to set up ODUk (e.g., ODUflex) LSP over ODUCn links,
   independently from how these links have been set up

   This document presents an overview of the OTUCn and ODUCn signals
   introduced in [ITU-T_G709_2016] and analyses how the current GMPLS

   routing and signalling mechanisms can be utilized to setup ODUk
   (e.g., ODUflex) LSPs over ODUCn links.

   Note: after discussion, the authors did not see any impact of 2020
   version of [ITU-T_G709_2020] on this draft.

2.  OTN terminology used in this document

   a.  OPUCn: Optical Payload Unit - Cn.  Where Cn indicates that the
       bit rate is approximately n*100G.

   b.  ODUCn: Optical Data Unit - Cn.

   c.  OTUCn: Fully standardized Optical Transport Unit - Cn.

   d.  OTUCn-M: This signal is an extension of the OTUCn signal
       introduced above.  This signal contains the same amount of
       overhead as the OTUCn signal, but contains a reduced amount of
       payload area.  Specifically, the payload area consists of M 5G
       tributary slots (where M is strictly less than 20*n).

   e.  PSI: OPU Payload Structure Indicator.  This is a 256-byte signal
       that describes the composition of the OPU signal.  This field is
       a concatenation of the Payload type (PT) and the Multiplex
       Structure Indicator (MSI) defined below.

   f.  MSI: Multiplex Structure Indicator.  This structure indicates the
       grouping of the tributary slots in an OPU payload area that
       realizes a client signal which is multiplexed into an OPU.  The
       individual clients multiplexed into the OPU payload area are
       distinguished by the Tributary Port number (TPN).

   Detailed description of these terms can be found in
   [ITU-T_G709_2016].

3.  Overview of the OTUCn/ODUCn in G.709

   This section provides an overview of OTUCn/ODUCn signals defined in
   [ITU-T_G709_2016].

3.1.  OTUCn

   In order to carry client signals with rates greater than 100 Gbit/s,
   [ITU-T_G709_2016] takes a general and scalable approach that
   decouples the rates of OTU signals from the client rate.  The new OTU
   signal is called OTUCn, and this signal is defined to have a rate of
   (approximately) n*100G.  The following are the key characteristics of
   the OTUCn signal:

Internet-Draft              B100G Extensions               November 2020


   a.  The OTUCn signal contains one ODUCn.  The OTUCn and ODUCn signals
       perform digital section roles only (see
       [ITU-T_G709_2016]:Section 6.1.1)

   b.  The OTUCn signals can be viewed as being formed by interleaving n
       OTUC signals (which are labeled 1, 2, ..., n), each of which has
       the format of a standard OTUk signal without the FEC columns (per
       [ITU-T_G709_2016]Figure 7-1).  The ODUCn have a similar
       structure, i.e. they can be seen as being formed by interleaving
       n instances of ODUC signals (respectively).  The OTUC signal
       contains the ODUC signals, just as in the case of fixed rate OTUs
       defined in G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016].

   c.  Each of the OTUC "slices" have the same overhead as the standard
       OTUk signal in G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016].  The combined signal
       OTUCn has n instances of OTUC overhead, ODUC overhead.

   d.  The OTUC signal has a slightly higher rate compared to the OTU4
       signal (without FEC); this is to ensure that the OPUC payload
       area can carry an ODU4 signal.

   As explained above, within G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016], the OTUCn, ODUCn
   and OPUCn signal structures are presented in a (physical) interface
   independent manner, by means of n OTUC, ODUC and OPUC instances that
   are marked #1 to #n.  Specifically, the definition of the OTUCn
   signal does not cover aspects such as FEC, modulation formats, etc.
   These details are defined as part of the adaptation of the OTUCn
   layer to the optical layer(s).  The specific interleaving of
   OTUC/ODUC/OPUC signals onto the optical signals is interface specific
   and specified for OTN interfaces with standardized application codes
   in the interface specific recommendations (G.709.x).

   OTUCn interfaces can be categorized as follows, based on the type of
   peer network element (see Figure 1):

   a.  inter-domain interfaces: These types of interfaces are used for
       connecting OTN edge nodes to (a) client equipment (e.g. routers)
       or (b) hand-off points from other OTN networks.  ITU-T has
       standardized the Flexible OTN (FlexO) interfaces to support these
       functions.  For example, Recommendation [ITU-T_G709.1] specifies
       a flexible interoperable short-reach OTN interface over which an
       OTUCn (n >=1) is transferred, using bonded FlexO interfaces which
       belong to a FlexO group.

   b.  intra-domain interfaces: In these cases, the OTUCn is transported
       using a proprietary (vendor specific) encapsulation, FEC etc.  It
       may also be possible to transport OTUCn for intra-domain links
       using FlexO.

                  Figure 1: OTUCn transport possibilities

3.1.1.  OTUCn-M

   The standard OTUCn signal has the same rate as that of the ODUCn
   signal as shown in Table 1.  This implies that the OTUCn signal can
   only be transported over wavelength groups which have a total
   capacity of multiples of (approximately) 100G.  Modern DSPs support a
   variety of bit rates per wavelength, depending on the reach
   requirements for the optical path.  In other words, it is possible to
   extend the reach of an optical path (i.e. increase the physical
   distance covered) by lowering the bitrate of the digital signal that
   is modulated onto the optical signals.  If the total rate of the ODUk
   LSPs planned to be carried over an ODUCn link is smaller than n*100G,
   it is possible to "crunch" the OTUCn not to transmit some of unused
   timeslots.  With this in mind, ITU-T supports the notion of a reduced
   rate OTUCn signal, termed the OTUCn-M.  The OTUCn-M signal is derived
   from the OTUCn signal by retaining all the n instances of overhead
   (one per OTUC slice) but with only M (M is less than 20*n) OPUCn
   tributary slots available to carry ODUk LSPs.

   As the "crunching" algorithm is not standardized, knowing the value
   of M is not enough to decide the timeslot availability.

3.2.  ODUCn

   The ODUCn signal [ITU-T_G709_2016] can be viewed as being formed by
   the appropriate interleaving of content from n ODUC signal instances.
   The ODUC frames have the same structure as a standard ODU -- in the
   sense that it has the same Overhead area, and the payload area -- but
   has a higher rate since its payload area can embed an ODU4 signal.

   The ODUCn signals have a rate that is captured in Table 1.

   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

                           Table 1: ODUCn rates

   The ODUCn is a multiplex section ODU signal, and is mapped into an
   OTUCn signal which provides the regenerator section layer.  In some
   scenarios, the ODUCn, and OTUCn signals will be co-terminated, i.e.
   they will have identical source/sink locations.  [ITU-T_G709_2016]
   allows for the ODUCn signal to pass through a digital regenerator
   node which will terminate the OTUCn layer, but will pass the
   regenerated (but otherwise untouched) ODUCn towards a different OTUCn
   interface where a fresh OTUCn layer will be initiated (see Figure 2).
   In this case, the ODUCn is carried by 3 OTUCn segments.

   Specifically, the OPUCn signal flows through these regenerators
   unchanged.  That is, the set of client signals, their TPNs, trib-slot
   allocation remains unchanged.  The ODUCn Overhead might be modified
   if TCM sub-layers are instantiated in order to monitor the
   performance of the regenerator hops.  In this sense, the ODUCn should
   NOT be seen as a general ODU which can be switched via an ODUk cross-
   connect.

3.3.  Time Slot Granularity

   [ITU-T_G709_2012] has introduced the support for 1.25G granular
   tributary slots in OPU2, OPU3, and OPU4 signals.  With the
   introduction of higher rate signals, it is not practical for the
   optical networks (and the data plane hardware) to support a very
   large number of connections at such a fine granularity.  [ITU-
   T_G709_2012] has defined the OPUC with a 5G tributary slot
   granularity.  This means that the ODUCn signal has 20*n tributary
   slots (of 5 Gbit/s capacity).  It is worthwhile considering that the
   range of tributary port number (TPN) is 10*n instead of 20*n, which
   restricts the maximum client signals that could be carried over one
   single ODUC1.

3.4.  Structure of OPUCn MSI with Payload type 0x22

   As mentioned above, the OPUCn signal has 20*n 5G tributary slots.
   The OPUCn MSI field has a fixed length of 40*n bytes and indicates
   the availability and occupation of each TS.  Two bytes are used for
   each of the 20*n tributary slots, and each such information structure
   has the following format ([ITU-T_G709_2016] G.709:Section 20.4.1):

   a.  The TS availability bit indicates if the tributary slot is
       available or unavailable

   b.  The TS occupation bit indicates if the tributary slot is
       allocated or unallocated

   c.  The tributary port number (14 bits) of the client signal that is
       being carried in this specific TS.  A flexible assignment of
       tributary port to tributary slots is possible.  Numbering of
       tributary ports is from 1 to 10*n.

3.5.  Client Signal Mappings

   The approach taken by the ITU-T to map non-OTN client signals to the
   appropriate ODU containers is as follows:

   a.  All client signals are mapped into an ODUk (e.g., ODUflex) as
       specified in clause 17 of [ITU-T_G709_2016].

   b.  ODU Virtual Concatenation has been deprecated.  This simplifies
       the network, and the supporting hardware since multiple different
       mappings for the same client are no longer necessary.  Note that
       legacy implementations that transported sub-100G clients using
       ODU VCAT shall continue to be supported.

   c.  ODUflex signals are low-order signals only.  If the ODUflex
       entities have rates of 100G or less, they can be transported over
       either an ODUk (k=1..4) or an ODUCn.  For ODUflex connections
       with rates greater than 100G, ODUCn is required.

4.  GMPLS Implications and Applicability

4.1.  TE-Link Representation

   Section 3 of RFC7138 describes how to represent G.709 OTUk/ODUk with
   TE-Links in GMPLS.  Similar to that, ODUCn links can also be
   represented as TE-Links, which can be seen in the figure below.

                         Figure 4: ODUCn TE-Links

   Two endpoints of a TE-Link are configured with the supported resource
   information, which may include whether the TE-Link is supported by an
   ODUCn or an ODUk or an OTUk, as well as the link attribute
   information (e.g., slot granularity, list of available tributary
   slot).

4.2.  Implications and Applicability for GMPLS Signalling

   Once the ODUCn TE-Link is configured, the GMPLS mechanisms defined in
   RFC7139 can be reused to set up ODUk/ODUflex LSP with no/few changes.
   As the resource on the ODUCn link which can be seen by the client
   ODUk/ODUflex is a set of 5G slots, the label defined in RFC7139 is
   able to accommodate the requirement of the setup of ODUk/ODUflex over
   ODUCn link.  In [RFC7139], the OTN-TDM GENERALIZED_LABEL object is
   used to indicate how the LO ODUj signal is multiplexed into the HO
   ODUk link.  In a similar manner, the OTN-TDM GENERALIZED_LABEL object
   is used to indicate how the ODUk signal is multiplexed into the ODUCn
   link.  The ODUk Signal Type is indicated by Traffic Parameters.  The
   IF_ID RSVP_HOP object provides a pointer to the interface associated
   with TE-Link and therefore the two nodes terminating the TE-link know
   (by internal/local configuration) the attributes of the ODUCn TE
   Link.

   Since the TPN currently defined in G.709 for ODUCn link has 14 bits,
   while this field in RFC7139 only has 12 bits, some extension work is
   needed.  Given that a 12-bit TPN field can support ODUCn links with
   up to n=400 (i.e. 40Tbit/s links), this extension is not urgently
   needed.

   An example is given below to illustrate the label format defined in
   RFC7139 for multiplexing ODU4 onto ODUC10.  One ODUC10 has 200 5G
   slots, and twenty of them are allocated to the ODU4.  Along with the
   increase of "n", the label may become lengthy, an optimized label
   format may be needed.

4.3.  Implications and Applicability for GMPLS Routing

   For routing, it is deemed that no extension to current mechanisms
   defined in RFC7138 are needed.  Because, once an ODUCn link is up,
   the resources that need to be advertised are the resources that
   exposed by this ODUCn link and the multiplexing hierarchy on this
   link.  Since the ODUCn link is the lowest layer of the ODU
   multiplexing hierarchy, there is no need to explicitly define a new

   value to represent the ODUCn signal type in the OSPF-TE routing
   protocol.

   The OSPF-TE extension defined in section 4 of RFC7138 can be reused
   to advertise the resource information on the ODUCn link to help
   finish the setup of ODUk/ODUflex.
