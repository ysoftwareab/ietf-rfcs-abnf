1.  Introduction

   The Conference Policy Control Protocol (CPCP) [1]specifies an
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that enumerates the
   conference policy data elements that enable a user to define a
   conference policy.  It, however, does not define user privileges (who
   is allowed to read or modify certain parts or all of a conference
   policy).

   In many cases, the creator of the conference policy is the sole user
   with access rights to the conference policy and other users do not
   have any rights to view nor modify the document.  However, there is a
   need for different privileges to exist where users can modify certain
   parts of the conference policy XML document.  This document specifies
   an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that enumerates the
   conference policy meta data that enable such privileges to exist.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from [13].  Some additional
   definitions are introduced in [1], including the defintion of a
   privileged user.

4.  Structure of a Conference Policy Privileges XML Document

   The conference policy privileges document is an XML [4] document that
   MUST be well-formed and MUST be valid according to schemas, including
   extension schemas, available to the validater and applicable to the
   XML document.  The Conference policy privelges documents MUST be
   based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  This specification
   makes use of XML namespaces for identifying conference policy
   privileges documents and document fragments.  The namespace URI for
   elements defined by this specification is a URN [6], using the
   namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [7] and extended by [8].  This
   URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:privileges


4.1  MIME Type for CPCP XML Document

   The MIME type for the CPCP XML document is

   "application/privileges+xml".

4.2  Privileges Root

   A conference policy privileges document begins with the root element
   tag <privileges>.  Other elements from different namespaces MAY be
   present for the purposes of extensibility.  Elements or attributes
   from unknown namespaces MUST be ignored.

   A user may create a new conference policy privieleges at the CPS by
   placing a new conference policy document at the CPS.  Depending on
   server policy and user privileges, the CPS may accept the creation.
   Only the creator of the conference can create a conference policy
   privileges document for that conference policy.

   A conference that exists without a conference policy privileges
   document allows all privileges to the creator of the conference
   policy only.  A conference policy privielges document can be deleted
   permanently by removing the conference policy document from the CPS.
   When the user deletes a conference policy document, the user SHOULD
   also delete the conference policy privielges document associated with
   the deleted conference.  A CPS may apply local policy in determining
   when and if to delete the conference policy privielges document if it
   has not been removed after a the conference policy document was
   deleted.

4.3  XML Document Description

4.3.1  Conference Policy Privileges

   One of the key components of the conference policy privileges
   document is the set of authorization rules that specify who is
   allowed to read and manipulate a conference policy.  The unordered
   list of authorization rules together define the conference policy
   privileges in the form of an authorization policy.

   The <uri> element appears after the root element and contains the URI
   of the conference policy document that the privileges defines within
   it apply to.  This is followed by the <ruleset> element which carry
   the rules defining the actual privileges.

   The conference policy privileges are enclosed in the <ruleset>
   element are formatted according to the XML schema defined in the
   common policy framework [2].  In the <ruleset> element, there can be
   multiple rules, each rule is represented by the <rule> element, each
   of which consist of three parts: conditions, actions and
   transformations.  Conditions determine whether a particular rule
   applies to a request.  Each action or transformation in the applied

Internet-Draft              CPCP-Privileges                 October 2004


   rule is a positive grant of permission to the conference policy user.
   The details of each specific element and attribute is described in
   [2].

   Asking the conference policy server to allow certain users to
   manipulate the conference policy is achieved by modifying an existing
   authorization rule or creating a new one.

   If the conference is long-lasting, it is possible that new rules are
   added all the time but old rules are almost never removed (some of
   them are overwritten, though).  This leads easily to the situation
   that the conference policy meta data contains many unnecessary rules
   which are not really needed anymore.  Therefore, there is a need to
   delete rules.  This can be achieved by removing that portion of the
   policy.

   Conflicting rules may exist (for example, both allowed and blocked
   action is defined for same target).  The common policy directives [2]
   dictate the behaviour in such situations.

   This section outlines the new conditions, actions and transformations
   for conference policy privileges.

4.3.1.1  Conditions

4.3.1.1.1  Validity

   The <validity> element, as defined in  the common policy framework
   [2], expresses the rule validity period by two attributes, a starting
   and a ending time.  Times are expressed in XML dateTime format.
   Expressing the lifetime of a rule implements a garbage collection
   mechanism.  A rule maker might not have always access to the
   conference policy server to remove some rules which grant
   permissions.  Hence this mechanisms allows to remove or invalidate
   granted permissions automatically without further interaction between
   the rule maker and the conference policy server.

   To give a real life example, there are often meetings where users can
   have access to modify the dial-out list from 10 minutes before the
   conference starts until 10 mintues after the conference starts.  One
   rules can be set in this scenario.  The following example demostrates
   this.  The meeting starts at 9:30 and ends at 12:30.  A manager with
   identity "manager@example.com" can read and modify the dial-out list
   betweem 8:50 and 9:40.  After that time until the conference ends,
   the manager can only read the dial-out-list

4.3.1.1.2  Identity

   The <identity> element is already defined in the common policy
   framework [2]The presence of the <identity> element is a condition
   requires any identity within it to be authenticated before a rule is
   applied to it.  This includes the <id> element (Section 4.3.1.1.2.1),
   the <any> element (Section 4.3.1.1.3.1), the <external-list> element
   (Section 4.3.1.1.3.2), their exceptions, and any future extension
   that carries an identity.  The absence of the <identity> element with
   in a condition indicated that the rule applies to all unauthenticated

   identities.  That is participants that have provided no authenticated
   identity to the conference focus.

4.3.1.1.2.1  Interpreting the <id> Element

   As earlier indicated, the <identity> element is already defined in
   the common policy framework [2].  However, the rules for interpreting
   the identities in <id> elements are left for each application to
   define separately.  This document, however, does not define the rules
   for interpreting identities in <id> elements in conferencing
   applications since those interpretation rules are signalling protocol
   specific.

      OPEN ISSUE: Do we need to state more than this? How are identities
      derived from users that join using POTS, H.323, etc.?


4.3.1.1.3  Conference Policy Identity

4.3.1.1.3.1  Matching Any Identity

   The <any> element is used to match any participant.  This allows a
   conference priveleges to be open to any authenticated user.  Just as
   for the <domain> element in <identity> element, The <any> element
   contains a list of <except> elements and allows to implement a simple
   blacklist mechanism.  The <except> element contains the identity.  It
   differs from the <domain> element in that the domain part is needed
   in the identity since it has not domain to refer to.

4.3.1.1.3.2  Matching Identities in External Lists

   The <external-list> element can be used to match those participants
   that are part of a resource list that is created externally.  The use
   of <external-list> is similar to that defined in Section x of [1].

4.3.1.1.4  Sphere

   The <sphere> element has no meaning in the context of conference
   policy and MUST be ignored if present.

4.3.1.2  Actions

4.3.1.2.1  Modifying Conference setting

   The <allow-modify-settings> element represents a boolean action.  If
   set to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to modify the conference
   settings in the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any
   modifications to the conference settings are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.2  Modifying Conference Information

   The <allow-modify-information> element represents a boolean action.
   If set to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to modify the conference
   information in the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any
   modifications to the conference information are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.3  Modifying Conference Time

   The <allow-modify-time> element represents a boolean action.  If set
   to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to modify the conference time in
   the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any modifications to the
   conference time are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.4  Modifying Authorization rules

   The <allow-modify-authorization-rules> element represents a boolean
   action.  If set to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to modify the
   authorization rules of a conference in the conference policy.  If set
   to FALSE, any modifications to the rules are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.5  Modifying Conference Dial-out List

   The <allow-modify-dol> element represents a boolean action.  If set
   to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to modify the conference dial-out
   list in the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any modifications to
   the dial-out list are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.6  Modifying Conference Refer List

   The <allow-modify-rl> element represents a boolean action.  If set to
   TRUE, the identity is allowed  to modify the conference refer list in
   the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any modifications to the
   refer list are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.7  Modifying Conference media streams

   The <allow-modify-ms> element represents a boolean action.  If set to
   TRUE, the identity is allowed  to modify the conference media streams
   in the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any modifications to the
   media streams are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.8  Creating Sidebars

   The <allow-modify-sidebar> element represents a boolean action.  If
   set to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to create and manipulate a
   sidebar by creating and modifying a <sidebar> element in a conference
   policy.  If set to FALSE, any sidebar creation and manipulation is
   rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.9  Modifying Conference Dial-in List

   The conference dial-in list is virtual and is not represented by a
   physical list in the conference policy.  It is rather a collection of
   authorization rules that allow users to join a conference.  The
   <allow-modify-dil> element represents a boolean action.  If set to
   TRUE, the identity is allowed  to create an authorization rule in the
   conference policy that give a user a join handling of "allow".  If
   set to FALSE, any modifications to authorization rules are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   modifications to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.10  Reading Conference setting

   The <allow-read-settings> element represents a boolean action.  If
   set to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to read the conference settings
   in the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any attempts to read the
   conference settings are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   read requests to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.12  Reading Conference Time

   The <allow-read-time> element represents a boolean action.  If set to
   TRUE, the identity is allowed  to read the conference time in the
   conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any attempts to read the
   conference time are rejected.

   If this element is undefined it has a value of FALSE, causing the
   read requests to be rejected.

4.3.1.2.13  Reading Authorization rules

   The <allow-read-authorization-rules> element represents a boolean
   action.  If set to TRUE, the identity is allowed  to read the
   authorization rules of a conference in the conference policy.  If set
   to FALSE, any attempts to read the rules are rejected.

5.1  A Simple Conference Policy Privileges Document

   The following document dictates that Bob and Alice are allowed to
   read and modify the conference settings at
   "http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.
   xml" why John can only read the dial-out list.





   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <privileges xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:privileges" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   	xmlns:cr="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:common-policy">
   	<uri>http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml"</uri>
   	<cr:ruleset>
   		<cr:rule id="1">
   			<cr:conditions>
   				<cr:identity>
   					<cr:id>bob@example.com</cr:id>
   					<cr:id>alice@example.com</cr:id>
   				</cr:identity>
   			</cr:conditions>
   			<cr:actions>
   				<allow-modify-settings>true</allow-modify-settings>
   				<allow-read-settings>true</allow-read-settings>
   			</cr:actions>

   				<cr:identity>
   					<cr:id>john@example.com</cr:id>
   				</cr:identity>
   			</cr:conditions>

   		</cr:rule>
   	</cr:ruleset>
   </privileges>


6.  Security Considerations

   A conference policy privileges document may contain information that
   is highly sensitive.  Its delivery to the conference server needs to



Khartabil & Niemi        Expires April 12, 2005                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              CPCP-Privileges                 October 2004


   happen strictly, paying special attention to integrity and
   confidentiality.  Reading the document is also a security concern
   since the conference policy proviliges document contains sensitive
   information like who is allowed to modify certain parts of a
   conference policy document.

   A milicious user can manipulate parts of the conference policy
   privileges document giving themselves and others privileges to
   manipulate the conference policy, including the dial-out list and the
   ruleset.  Those authorization rules carry the privileges that certain
   identities have.  If an unauthorized user gets access to this
   document (pretending to be someone else), s/he can manipulate those
   rules giving himself and other unauthorized users access to the
   conference policy.  Some of the things that a malicious user can do
   include: denying users certain privileges, removing rules for certain
   identities and giving privileges to other malicious users.
   Therefore, it is very important that only authorized clients are able
   to manipulate the conference policy privileges document.  Any
   conference policy privileges document transport protocol MUST provide
   authentication, confidentiality and integrity.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1  application/privileges+xml MIME TYPE

   MIME media type: application

   MIME subtype name: privileges+xml

   Mandatory parameters: none

   Optional parameters: Same as charset parameter application/xml as
   specified in RFC 3023 [5].

   Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of
   application/xml as specified in RFC 3023 [5].

   Security considerations: See section 10 of RFC 3023 [5] and section
   Section 7 of this document.

   Interoperability considerations: none.

   Published specification: This document.

   Applications which use this media type: This document type has been
   used to support conference policy manipulation for SIP based
   conferencing.
