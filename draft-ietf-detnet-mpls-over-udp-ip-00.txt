1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by
   a network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows with a low
   packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
   General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

   The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
   functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding
   sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service
   protection and reordering.  The forwarding sub-layer is used to
   provides congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and
   limited reordering) leveraging MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms.

   This document specifies use of the MPLS DetNet encapsulation over an
   IP network.  The approach is modeled on the operation of MPLS and
   PseudoWires (PW) over an IP Packet Switched Network (PSN)
   [RFC3985][RFC4385][RFC7510].  It maps the MPLS data plane
   encapsulation described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] to the DetNet IP
   data plane defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   To carry DetNet with full functionality at the DetNet layer over an
   IP network, the following components are required (these are a subset

Internet-Draft             DetNet MPLS over IP                  May 2019


   of the requirements for MPLS encapsulation listed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls]):

   1.  A method of identifying the DetNet flow group to the processing
       element.

   2.  A method of carrying the DetNet sequence number.

   3.  A method of distinguishing DetNet OAM packets from DetNet data
       packets.

   4.  A method of carrying queuing and forwarding indication.

   These requirements are satisfied by the DetNet over MPLS
   Encapsulation described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Terms Used in This Document

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], and the reader is
   assumed to be familiar with that document and its terminology.

2.2.  Abbreviations

   The following abbreviations are used in this document:

   CW            Control Word.

   d-CW          A DetNet Control Word (d-CW) is used for sequencing and
                 identifying duplicate packets of a DetNet flow at the
                 DetNet service sub-layer.

   DetNet        Deterministic Networking.

   F-Label       A Detnet "forwarding" label that identifies the LSP
                 used to forward a DetNet flow across an MPLS PSN, e.g.,
                 a hop-by-hop label used between label switching routers
                 (LSR).

   LSR           Label Switching Router.

   MPLS          Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   OAM           Operations, Administration, and Maintenance.

   PEF           Packet Elimination Function.

Internet-Draft             DetNet MPLS over IP                  May 2019


   PRF           Packet Replication Function.

   PREOF         Packet Replication, Elimination and Ordering Functions.

   POF           Packet Ordering Function.

   PSN           Packet Switched Network.

   PW            PseudoWire.

   S-Label       A DetNet "service" label that is used between DetNet
                 nodes that implement also the DetNet service sub-layer
                 functions.  An S-Label is also used to identify a
                 DetNet flow at DetNet service sub-layer.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  DetNet MPLS Operation over DetNet IP PSNs

   This document builds on the specification of MPLS over UDP and IP
   defined in [RFC7510].  It replaces the F-Label(s) used in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] with UDP and IP headers.  The UDP and IP
   header information is used to identify DetNet flows, including member
   flows, per [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  The resulting encapsulation is
   shown in Figure 1.

   Note that this encapsulation works equally well with IPv4, IPv6, and
   IPv6-based Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].

   d-CW and and S-Labels are used as defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls]
   and are not modified by this document.

   To support outgoing DetNet MPLS over IP, an implementation MUST
   support the provisioning of IP/UDP header information in place of
   sets of F-Labels.  Note that multiple sets of F-Labels can be
   provisioned to support PRF on transmitted DetNet flows and therefore,
   when PRF is supported, multiple IP/UDP headers MAY be provisioned.
   When multiple IP/UDP headers are provisioned for a particular
   outgoing app-flow, a copy of the outgoing packet, including the
   pushed S-Label, MUST be made for each.  The headers for each outgoing
   packet MUST be based on the configuration information and as defined
   in [RFC7510], with one exception.  The one exception is that the UDP
   Source Port value MUST be set to uniquely identify the DetNet
   (forwarding sub-layer) flow.  The packet MUST then be handed as a
   DetNet IP packet, per [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   To support receive processing an implementation MUST also support the
   provisioning of received IP/UDP header information.  When S-Labels
   are taken from platform label space, all that is required is to
   provision that receiving IP/UDP encapsulated DetNet MPLS packets is
   permitted.  Once the IP/UDP header is stripped, the S-label uniquely
   identifies the app-flow.  When S-Labels are not taken from platform
   label space, IP/UDP header information MUST be provisioned.  The
   provisioned information MUST then be used to identify incoming app-

   flows based on the combination of S-Label and incoming IP/UDP header.
   Normal receive processing, including PEOF can then take place.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of DetNet in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and [I-D.sdt-detnet-security].  Other
   security considerations will be added in a future version of this
   draft.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no IANA requests.
