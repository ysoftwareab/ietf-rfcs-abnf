1. Introduction

   In wireless environments and especially in cellular systems, such as
   GSM/GPRS, there is a need to maximize the transport efficiency of
   data over the radio interface. The radio spectrum is rather expensive
   and must be carefully used. Therefore the cellular systems must
   support a sufficient number of users to make them economical
   feasible. Thus, there is a limitation in the per user bandwidth.

   Compressing the headers of the network and transport protocols used
   for carrying user data is one way to make more efficient use of the
   scarce radio resources [ROHC]. However, compression of the messages
   from signaling protocols, such as SIP/SDP, should also be considered
   to increase the radio resource usage even further. Compression will
   also improve the service quality, by reducing the user idle time, at
   e.g. call setup.
   When IP will be used end-to-end, new applications, such as streaming,
   will be brought to tiny end-host, such as cellular devices. This will
   introduce additional traffic in cellular systems. Compression of
   signaling messages, such as RTSP [RTSP], should also be considered to
   improve both the service availability and quality.

   New services with their corresponding signaling protocols make it
   reasonable to consider a scheme that is generic. The scheme should be
   generic in the meaning that the scheme efficiently can be applied to
   arbitrary protocols with certain characteristics, such as the ASCII
   based protocols SIP and RTSP.

INTERNET-DRAFT         SigComp Reqs & Assumptions           May 03, 2002


1.1. Protocol Characteristics

   The following application signaling protocols are expected to be
   commonly used in the future. Some of their characteristics are
   described below.

1.1.1 SIP

   The Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] is an application layer
   protocol for establishing, modifying and terminating multimedia
   sessions or calls. These sessions include Internet multimedia
   conferences, Internet telephony and similar applications. SIP can be
   used over either TCP [TCP] or UDP [UDP]. SIP is a text based
   protocol, using ISO 10646 in UTF-8 encoding.

1.1.2 SDP

   The Session Description Protocol [SDP] is used to advertise
   multimedia conferences and communicate conference addresses and
   conference tool specific information. It is also used for general
   real-time multimedia session description purposes. SDP is carried in
   the message body of SIP and RTSP messages. SDP is text based using
   the ISO 10646 character set in UTF-8 encoding.³

1.1.3 RTSP

   The Real Time Streaming Protocol [RTSP] is an application level
   protocol for controlling delivery of data with real-time properties,
   such as audio and video. RTSP may use UDP or TCP (or other) as
   transport protocol. RTSP is text based using the ISO 10646 character
   set in UTF-8 encoding.

1.1.4 Protocol Similarities

   The above protocols have many similarities. These similarities will
   have implications on solutions to the problems they create in
   conjunction with e.g. cellular radio access. The similarities
   include:

   - Requests and reply characteristics. When a sender sends a request,
     it stays idle until it has received a response. Hence, it typically
     takes a number of round trip times to conclude e.g. a SIP session.

   - They are ASCII based.

   - They are generous in size in order to provide the necessary
     information to the session participants.

   - SIP and RTSP share many common header field names, methods and
     status codes. The traffic patterns are also similar. The signaling
     is carried out primarily under the set up phase. For SIP this means



Hannu                                                           [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SigComp Reqs & Assumptions           May 03, 2002


     that the majority of the signaling is carried out to set up a phone
     call or multimedia session. For RTSP the majority of the signaling
     is done before the transmission of application data.

1.2. Cellular System Radio Characteristics

   Partly to enable high utilization of cellular systems and partly due
   to the unreliable nature of the radio media, cellular links have
   characteristics that differ somewhat from a typical fixed link, e.g.
   copper or fiber. The most important characteristics are the lossy
   behavior of cellular links and the large round trip times.

   The quality in a radio system typically changes from one radio frame
   to another due to fading in the radio channel. Due to the nature of
   the radio media and interference from other radio users, the average
   bit error rate (BER) can be 10e-3 with a variation roughly between
   10e-2 to 10e-4. To be able to use the radio media with its error
   characteristics, methods such as forward error correction (FEC) and
   interleaving are used. If these methods were not used, the BER of a
   cellular radio channel would be around 10 %. Thus, radio links are by
   nature error prone. The final packet loss rate may be further reduced
   by applying low level retransmissions (ARQ) over the radio channel;
   this, however, trades decreased packet loss rate for a larger delay.
   By applying methods to decrease BER, the system delay is increased.
   In some cellular systems, the algorithmic channel round trip delay is
   in the order of  80 ms. Other sources of delays are DSP-processing,
   node-internal delay and transmission. A general value for the RTT is
   difficult to state, but it might be as high as 200 ms.

   For cellular systems it is of vital importance to have a sufficient
   number of users per cell; otherwise the system cost would prohibit
   deployment. It is crucial to use the existing bandwidth carefully;
   hence the average user bit rate is typically relatively low compared
   to the average user bit rate in wired line systems. This is
   especially important for mass market services like voice.



















Hannu                                                           [Page 4]

2. Motivation for Signaling Reduction

   The need for solving the problems caused by the signaling protocol
   messages is exemplified in this chapter by looking at a typical
   SIP/SDP Call Setup sequence over a narrow band channel.

2.1 Estimation of Call Setup Delay Using SIP/SDP

   Figure 2.1 shows an example of SIP signaling between two termination
   points with a wireless link between, and the resulting delay under
   certain system assumptions.

   It should be noted that the used figures represent a very narrow band
   link even if e.g. a WCDMA system can provide maximum bit rates up to
   2 Mbits/s in ideal conditions. However, this requires that one user
   consumes all radio resources in a cell. For a mass market service
   such as voice, it is always crucial to reduce the bandwidth
   requirements for each user.

   The one way delay is calculated according to the following equation:

   OneWayDelay =
        MessageSize[bits]/LinkSpeed[bits/sec] + RTT[sec] / 2     (eq. 1)

   The following values have been used:

   RTT/2:                     70 ms
   LinkSpeed                  9.6 kbps

   The delay formula is based on an approximation of a WCDMA radio
   access method for speech services. The approximation is rather crude.
   For instance, delays caused by possible retransmissions due to errors
   are ignored. Further, these calculations also assume that there is
   only one cellular link in the path and also take delays in an
   eventual intermediate IP-network into account. Even if this
   approximation is crude, it is still sufficient to provide
   representative numbers and enable comparisons.
   The message size given in Figure 2.1, is typical for a SIP/SDP call
   setup sequence.

   Figure 2.1. SIP signaling delays assuming a link speed of 9600
   bits/sec and a RTT of 140 ms.

2.1.1 Delay Results

   Applying equation 1 to each SIP/SDP message shown in the example of
   Figure 2.1 gives a total delay of 4131 ms from the first SIP/SDP
   message to the last. The RSVP and Session Management (Radio Bearer
   setup), displayed in Figure 2.1 will add approximately 1.5 seconds to
   the total delay, using equation 1. However, there will also be RSVP
   and SM signaling prior to the SIP INVITE message to establish the
   radio bearer, which would add approximately another 1.5 seconds.

   In [TSG] there is a comparison between GERAN call setup using SIP and
   ordinary GSM call setup. For a typical GSM call setup the time is
   about 3.6 seconds, and for the case when using SIP, the call setup is
   approximately 7.9 seconds.

   Another situation that would benefit from reduced signaling is when
   carrying signaling messages over narrow bandwidth links in mid-call.
   For GERAN, this will result in frame stealing with degraded speech
   quality as a result.






Hannu                                                           [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SigComp Reqs & Assumptions           May 03, 2002


   Thus, solutions are needed to reduce the signaling delay and the
   required bandwidth when considering both system bandwidth
   requirements and service setup delays.


3. Alternatives for Signaling Reduction

   More or less attractive solutions to the previously mentioned
   problems can be outlined:

   - Increase the user bit rate

   An increase of the bit rate per user will decrease the number of
   users per cell. There exist systems (for example WCDMA) which can
   provide high bit rates and even variable rates for instance at setup
   of new sessions. However, there are also systems, e.g. GSM/EDGE,
   where it is not possible to reach these high bit rates in all
   situations. At the cell borders, for example, the signal strength to
   noise ratio will be lower and result in a lower bit rate. In general,
   an unnecessary increase of the bit rate should be avoided due to the
   higher system cost introduced and the possibility of denial of
   service. The latter could for example be caused by lack of enough
   bandwidth to support sending of the large setup message within a
   required time period, which is set for QoS reasons.

   - Decrease the RTT of the cellular link

   Decreasing the RTT would require substantial system changes and is
   thus not feasible in the short term. Further, the RTT-delay due to
   interleaving and FEC will always have to be present regardless of
   which system is used. Otherwise the BER will be too high for the
   received data to be useful, or alternatively trigger retransmissions
   giving an average total delay of the same or higher magnitude.

   - Optimize message sequence for the protocols

   If the request/response pattern could be eased up, then "keeping the
   pipe full" could be a way forward. Thus, instead of following the
   message sequence described in Figure 4.2, more than one message would
   be sent in row, even though no response has been received. However,
   this would entail protocol changes and may be difficult at current
   date.

   - Protocol stripping

   Removing fields from a message would decrease the size of the
   messages to some extent. However, this would cause loss of
   transparency and thus violate the End-to-End principle and is thus
   not desirable.





Hannu                                                           [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SigComp Reqs & Assumptions           May 03, 2002


   - Compression

   By compressing messages, the impact of the mentioned problems could
   be decreased. Compared to the other possible solutions compression
   can be made, and must be, transparent to the end-user application.
   Thus, compression seems to be the most attractive way forward.


4. Assumptions

   - Negotiation

     How the usage of compression is negotiated is out of the scope for
     the compression solution and must be handled by e.g. the protocol
     which messages are to be compressed.

   - Reliable transport

     With reliable transport it is assumed a transport that recovers
     from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of
     order, [TCP].

   - Unreliable transport

     With unreliable transport it is assumed a transport that does not
     have the capabilities of a reliable transport.


5. Requirements

   This chapter states requirements for a signaling compression scheme
   to be developed in the IETF ROHC WG.

   The requirements are divided into two parts. Section 5.1 sets general
   requirements concerning the Internet infrastructure, while Section
   5.2 sets requirements on the scheme itself.

5.1. General Requirements

   1.  Transparency: When a message is compressed and then decompressed
       the result must be bitwise identical to the original message

       Justification: This is to ensure that the compression scheme will
       not cause problems for any current or future part of the Internet
       infrastructure.

       Note: See also requirement 9.

   2.  Header compression coexistence: The compression scheme must be
       able to coexist with header compression, especially the ROHC
       protocol.



Hannu                                                           [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SigComp Reqs & Assumptions           May 03, 2002


       Justification: Signaling compression is used because there is a
       need to conserve bandwidth usage. In that case, header
       compression will likely be needed too.


   3a. Compatibility: The compression scheme must be constructed in such
       a way that it allows the above protocols' mechanisms to negotiate
       whether the compression scheme is to be applied or not.

       Justification: Two entities must be able to communicate
       regardless if the signaling compression scheme is implemented at
       both entities or not.

   3b. Ubiquity: Modifications to the protocols generating the messages
       that are to be compressed, must not be required for the
       compression scheme to work.

       Justification: This will simplify deployment of the compression
       scheme.

       Note: This does not preclude making extensions, which are related
       to the signaling compression scheme, to existing protocols, as
       long as the extensions are backward compatible.

   4.  Generality: Compression of arbitrary message streams must be
       supported. The signaling compression scheme must not be limited
       to certain protocols, traffic patterns or sessions. It must not
       assume any message pattern to be able to perform compression.

       Justification: There might be a future need for compression of
       different ASCII based signaling protocols. This requirement will
       minimize future work.

       Note: This does not preclude optimization for certain streams.

   5.  Unidirectional routes: The compression scheme must be able to
       operate on unidirectional routes, i.e. without explicit feedback
       messages from the decompressor.

       Note: Implementations on unidirectional routes might possibly
       show a degraded performance compared to implementations on bi-
       directional routes.

   6.  Transport: The solution must work for both unreliable and
       reliable underlying transport protocols, e.g. UDP and TCP.

       Justification: The protocols, which generate the messages that
       are to be compressed, may use either an unreliable or a reliable
       underlying transport.

       Note: This should not be taken to mean that the same set of



Hannu                                                           [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SigComp Reqs & Assumptions           May 03, 2002


       solution mechanisms must be used over both unreliable and
       reliable transport.

5.2. Performance Requirements

   The performance requirements in this section and the following
   subsections are valid for both unreliable and reliable underlying
   transport.

   7.  Scalability: The scheme must be flexible to accommodate a range
       of compressors/decompressors with varying memory and processor
       capabilities.

       Justification: A primary target for the signaling compression
       scheme is cellular systems, where the mobile terminals have
       varying capabilities.

   8.  Delay: The signaling compression must not noticeably add to the
       delay experienced by the end user.

       Justification: Reduction of the user experienced delay is the
       main purpose of signaling compression.

       Note: This requirement is intended to prevent schemes that
       achieve compression efficiency at the expense of delay, i.e.
       queuing of messages to improve the compression efficiency should
       be avoided.

   The following requirements are grouped into two subsections, a
   robustness section and a compression efficiency section.

5.2.1. Robustness

   The requirements in this section concern the issue when compressed
   messages should be correctly decompressed. The transparency
   requirement (first requirement), covers the issue with faulty
   decompressed messages.

   9.  Residual errors: The compression scheme must be resilient against
       errors undetected by lower layers, i.e. the probability of
       incorrect decompression caused by such undetected errors must be
       low.

       Justification: A primary target for the signaling compression
       scheme is cellular systems, were undetected errors might be
       introduced on the cellular link.

   10. Error propagation: Propagation of errors due to signaling
       compression should be kept at an absolute minimum. Loss or damage
       to a single or several messages, between compressor and
       decompressor should not prevent compression and decompression of



Hannu                                                          [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SigComp Reqs & Assumptions           May 03, 2002


       later messages.

       Justification: Error propagation reduces resource utilization and
       quality.

   11. Delay: The compression scheme must be able to perform compression
       and decompression of messages under all expected delay
       conditions.

5.2.2. Compression Efficiency

   This section states requirements related to compression efficiency.

   12. Message loss: Loss or damage to a single or several messages, on
       the link between compressor and decompressor, should not prevent
       the usage of later messages in the compression and decompression
       process.

   13. Moderate message misordering: The scheme should allow for correct
       decompression of messages, that have been moderately misordered
       (1-2 messages) between compressor and decompressor. The scheme
       should not prevent the usage of later message in the compression
       and decompression process.

       Justification: Misordering is frequent on the Internet, and this
       kind of misordering is common.


6. Security Considerations

   A protocol specified to meet these requirements must be able to cope
   with packets that has undergone security measures, such as
   encryption, without adding any security risks. This document by
   itself, however, does not add any security risks.


7. IANA Considerations

   A protocol which meets these requirements may require the IANA to
   assign various numbers. This document by itself, however, does not
   require any IANA involvement.

Appendix A. Test sequence

   The SIP message sequence depicted in figure A1 together with the
   static dictionary, could be used to test the compression scheme for
   compression efficiency and processing and memory requirements. Call
   Setup delays should be calculated according to equation (1) in
   section 2.1.

   - Static dictionary

   Needed spaces are indicated with <sp>
   Needed carriage returns are indicated with <cr>
   Needed line feeds are indicated with <lf>
   All other possible spaces, carriage returns, line feeds etc, must be
   disregarded when using the static dictionary in implementations.
