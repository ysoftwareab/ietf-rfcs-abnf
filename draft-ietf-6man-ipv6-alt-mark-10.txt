1.  Introduction

   [RFC8321] and [RFC8889] describe a passive performance measurement
   method, which can be used to measure packet loss, latency and jitter
   on live traffic.  Since this method is based on marking consecutive
   batches of packets, the method is often referred to as the Alternate
   Marking Method.

   This document defines how the Alternate Marking Method can be used to
   measure performance metrics in IPv6.  The rationale is to apply the
   Alternate Marking methodology to IPv6 and therefore allow detailed
   packet loss, delay and delay variation measurements both hop-by-hop
   and end-to-end to exactly locate the issues in an IPv6 network.

   The Alternate Marking is an on-path telemetry technique and consists
   of synchronizing the measurements in different points of a network by
   switching the value of a marking bit and therefore dividing the
   packet flow into batches.  Each batch represents a measurable entity
   recognizable by all network nodes along the path.  By counting the
   number of packets in each batch and comparing the values measured by
   different nodes, it is possible to precisely measure the packet loss.
   Similarly, the alternation of the values of the marking bits can be
   used as a time reference to calculate the delay and delay variation.
   The Alternate Marking operation is further described in Section 5.

   The format of IPv6 addresses is defined in [RFC4291] while [RFC8200]
   defines the IPv6 Header, including a 20-bit Flow Label and the IPv6
   Extension Headers.

   This document introduces a new TLV (type-length-value) that can be
   encoded in the Options Headers (Hop-by-Hop or Destination) for the
   purpose of the Alternate Marking Method application in an IPv6
   domain.

   The threat model for the application of the Alternate Marking Method
   in an IPv6 domain is reported in Section 6.  As with all on-path
   telemetry techniques, the only definitive solution is that this
   methodology MUST be applied in a controlled domain.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms related to the Alternate Marking Method
   as defined in [RFC8321] and [RFC8889].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Alternate Marking application to IPv6

   The Alternate Marking Method requires a marking field.  Several
   alternatives could be considered such as IPv6 Extension Headers, IPv6
   Address and Flow Label.  But, it is necessary to analyze the
   drawbacks for all the available possibilities, more specifically:

      Reusing existing Extension Header for Alternate Marking leads to a
      non-optimized implementation;




Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


      Using the IPv6 destination address to encode the Alternate Marking
      processing is very expensive;

      Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Alternate Marking conflicts with the
      utilization of the Flow Label for load distribution purpose
      ([RFC6438]).

   In the end, a new Hop-by-Hop or a new Destination Option is the best
   choice.

   The approach for the Alternate Marking application to IPv6 specified
   in this memo is compliant with [RFC8200].  It involves the following
   operations:

   o  The source node is the only one that writes the Option Header to
      mark alternately the flow (for both Hop-by-Hop and Destination
      Option).  The intermediate nodes and destination node MUST only
      read the marking values of the option without modifying the Option
      Header.

   o  In case of Hop-by-Hop Option Header carrying Alternate Marking
      bits, it is not inserted or deleted, but can be read by any node
      along the path.  The intermediate nodes may be configured to
      support this Option or not and the measurement can be done only
      for the nodes configured to read the Option.  As further discussed
      in Section 4, the presence of the hop-by-hop option should not
      affect the traffic throughput both on nodes that do not recognize
      this option and on the nodes that support it.  However, it is
      worth mentioning that there is a difference between theory and
      practice.  Indeed, in a real implementation it can happen that
      packets with hop-by-hop option could also be skipped or processed
      in the slow path.  While some proposals are trying to address this
      problem and make Hop-by-Hop Options more practical
      ([I-D.peng-v6ops-hbh], [I-D.hinden-6man-hbh-processing]), these
      aspects are out of the scope for this document.

   o  In case of Destination Option Header carrying Alternate Marking
      bits, it is not processed, inserted, or deleted by any node along
      the path until the packet reaches the destination node.  Note
      that, if there is also a Routing Header (RH), any visited
      destination in the route list can process the Option Header.

   Hop-by-Hop Option Header is also useful to signal to routers on the
   path to process the Alternate Marking.  However, as said, routers
   will only examine this option if properly configured.

   The optimization of both implementation and scaling of the Alternate
   Marking Method is also considered and a way to identify flows is

   required.  The Flow Monitoring Identification field (FlowMonID), as
   introduced in Section 5.3, goes in this direction and it is used to
   identify a monitored flow.

   The FlowMonID is different from the Flow Label field of the IPv6
   Header ([RFC6437]).  The Flow Label field in the IPv6 header is used
   by a source to label sequences of packets to be treated in the
   network as a single flow and, as reported in [RFC6438], it can be
   used for load-balancing/equal cost multi-path (LB/ECMP).  The reuse
   of Flow Label field for identifying monitored flows is not considered
   because it may change the application intent and forwarding behavior.
   Also, the Flow Label may be changed en route and this may also
   invalidate the integrity of the measurement.  Furthermore, since the
   Flow Label is pseudo-random, there is always a finite probability of
   collision.  Those reasons make the definition of the FlowMonID
   necessary for IPv6.  Indeed, the FlowMonID is designed and only used
   to identify the monitored flow.  Flow Label and FlowMonID within the
   same packet are totally disjoint, have different scope, are used to
   identify flows based on different criteria, and are intended for
   different use cases.

   The rationale for the FlowMonID is further discussed in Section 5.3.
   This 20 bit field allows easy and flexible identification of the
   monitored flow and enables improved measurement correlation and finer
   granularity since it can be used in combination with the traditional
   TCP/IP 5-tuple to identify a flow.  An important point that will be
   discussed in Section 5.3.1 is the uniqueness of the FlowMonID and how
   to allow disambiguation of the FlowMonID in case of collision.

   The following section highlights an important requirement for the
   application of the Alternate Marking to IPv6.  The concept of the
   controlled domain is explained and it is considered an essential
   precondition, as also highlighted in Section 6.

2.1.  Controlled Domain

   [RFC8799] introduces the concept of specific limited domain solutions
   and, in this regard, it is reported the IPv6 Application of the
   Alternate Marking Method as an example.

   IPv6 has much more flexibility than IPv4 and innovative applications
   have been proposed, but for a number of reasons, such as the
   policies, options supported, the style of network management and
   security requirements, it is suggested to limit some of these
   applications to a controlled domain.  This is also the case of the
   Alternate Marking application to IPv6 as assumed hereinafter.





Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   Therefore, the IPv6 application of the Alternate Marking Method MUST
   be deployed in a controlled domain.  It is RECOMMENDED that an
   implementation filters packets that carry Alternate Marking data and
   are entering or leaving the controlled domains.

   A controlled domain is a managed network where it is required to
   select, monitor and control the access to the network by enforcing
   policies at the domain boundaries in order to discard undesired
   external packets entering the domain and check the internal packets
   leaving the domain.  It does not necessarily mean that a controlled
   domain is a single administrative domain or a single organization.  A
   controlled domain can correspond to a single administrative domain or
   can be composed by multiple administrative domains under a defined
   network management.  Indeed, some scenarios may imply that the
   Alternate Marking Method involves more than one domain, but in these
   cases, it is RECOMMENDED that the multiple domains create a whole
   controlled domain while traversing the external domain by employing
   IPsec [RFC4301] authentication and encryption or other VPN technology
   that provides full packet confidentiality and integrity protection.
   In a few words, it must be possible to control the domain boundaries
   and eventually use specific precautions if the traffic traverse the
   Internet.

   The security considerations reported in Section 6 also highlight this
   requirement.

2.1.1.  Alternate Marking Measurement Domain

   The Alternate Marking measurement domain can overlap with the
   controlled domain or may be a subset of the controlled domain.  The
   typical scenarios for the application of the Alternate Marking Method
   depend on the controlled domain boundaries, in particular:

      the user equipment can be the starting or ending node, only in
      case it is fully managed and if it belongs to the controlled
      domain.  In this case the user generated IPv6 packets contain the
      Alternate Marking data.  But, in practice, this is not common due
      to the fact that the user equipment cannot be totally secured in
      the majority of cases.

      the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) is most likely to be the
      starting or ending node since it connects the user's premises with
      the service provider's network and therefore belongs to the
      operator's controlled domain.  Typically the CPE encapsulates a
      received packet in an outer IPv6 header which contains the
      Alternate Marking data.  The CPE can also be able to filter and
      drop packets from outside of the domain with inconsistent fields
      to make effective the relevant security rules at the domain

      boundaries, for example a simple security check can be to insert
      the Alternate Marking data if and only if the destination is
      within the controlled domain.

3.  Definition of the AltMark Option

   The definition of a new TLV for the Options Extension Headers,
   carrying the data fields dedicated to the Alternate Marking method,
   is reported below.

3.1.  Data Fields Format

   The following figure shows the data fields format for enhanced
   Alternate Marking TLV (AltMark).  This AltMark data can be
   encapsulated in the IPv6 Options Headers (Hop-by-Hop or Destination
   Option).

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              FlowMonID                |L|D|     Reserved      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   o  Option Type: 8-bit identifier of the type of Option that needs to
      be allocated.  Unrecognized Types MUST be ignored on processing.
      For Hop-by-Hop Options Header or Destination Options Header,
      [RFC8200] defines how to encode the three high-order bits of the
      Option Type field.  The two high-order bits specify the action
      that must be taken if the processing IPv6 node does not recognize
      the Option Type; for AltMark these two bits MUST be set to 00
      (skip over this Option and continue processing the header).  The
      third-highest-order bit specifies whether the Option Data can
      change en route to the packet's final destination; for AltMark the
      value of this bit MUST be set to 0 (Option Data does not change en
      route).  In this way, since the three high-order bits of the
      AltMark Option are set to 000, it means that nodes can simply skip
      this Option if they do not recognize and that the data of this
      Option do not change en route, indeed the source is the only one
      that can write it.

   o  Opt Data Len: 4.  It is the length of the Option Data Fields of
      this Option in bytes.

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   o  FlowMonID: 20-bit unsigned integer.  The FlowMon identifier is
      described in Section 5.3.  As further discussed below, it has been
      picked as 20 bits since it is a reasonable value and a good
      compromise in relation to the chance of collision if it is set
      pseudo randomly by the source node or set by a centralized
      controller.

   o  L: Loss flag for Packet Loss Measurement as described in
      Section 5.1;

   o  D: Delay flag for Single Packet Delay Measurement as described in
      Section 5.2;

   o  Reserved: is reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be set to
      zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

4.  Use of the AltMark Option

   The AltMark Option is the best way to implement the Alternate Marking
   method and it is carried by the Hop-by-Hop Options header and the
   Destination Options header.  In case of Destination Option, it is
   processed only by the source and destination nodes: the source node
   inserts and the destination node processes it.  While, in case of
   Hop-by-Hop Option, it may be examined by any node along the path, if
   explicitly configured to do so.

   It is important to highlight that the Option Layout can be used both
   as Destination Option and as Hop-by-Hop Option depending on the Use
   Cases and it is based on the chosen type of performance measurement.
   In general, it is needed to perform both end to end and hop by hop
   measurements, and the Alternate Marking methodology allows, by
   definition, both performance measurements.  In many cases the end-to-
   end measurement is not enough and it is required the hop-by-hop
   measurement, so the most complete choice can be the Hop-by-Hop
   Options Header.

   IPv6, as specified in [RFC8200], allows nodes to optionally process
   Hop-by-Hop headers.  Specifically the Hop-by-Hop Options header is
   not inserted or deleted, but may be examined or processed by any node
   along a packet's delivery path, until the packet reaches the node (or
   each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast) identified in the
   Destination Address field of the IPv6 header.  Also, it is expected
   that nodes along a packet's delivery path only examine and process
   the Hop-by-Hop Options header if explicitly configured to do so.

   Another scenario that can be mentioned is the presence of a Routing
   Header, in particular it is possible to consider SRv6.  A new type of
   Routing Header, referred as Segment Routing Header (SRH), has been



Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   defined in [RFC8754] for SRv6.  Like any other use case of IPv6, Hop-
   by-Hop and Destination Options are usable when SRv6 header is
   present.  Because SRv6 is implemented through a Segment Routing
   Header (SRH), Destination Options before the Routing Header are
   processed by each destination in the route list, that means, in case
   of SRH, by every SR node that is identified by the SR path.  More
   details about the SRv6 application are described in
   [I-D.fz-spring-srv6-alt-mark].

   In summary, it is possible to list the alternative possibilities:

   o  Destination Option not preceding a Routing Header => measurement
      only by node in Destination Address.

   o  Hop-by-Hop Option => every router on the path with feature
      enabled.

   o  Destination Option preceding a Routing Header => every destination
      node in the route list.

   In general, Hop-by-Hop and Destination Options are the most suitable
   ways to implement Alternate Marking.

   It is worth mentioning that new Hop-by-Hop Options are not strongly
   recommended in [RFC7045] and [RFC8200], unless there is a clear
   justification to standardize it, because nodes may be configured to
   ignore the Options Header, drop or assign packets containing an
   Options Header to a slow processing path.  In case of the AltMark
   data fields described in this document, the motivation to standardize
   a new Hop-by-Hop Option is that it is needed for OAM (Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance).  An intermediate node can read it
   or not, but this does not affect the packet behavior.  The source
   node is the only one that writes the Hop-by-Hop Option to mark
   alternately the flow, so, the performance measurement can be done for
   those nodes configured to read this Option, while the others are
   simply not considered for the metrics.

   The Hop-by-Hop Option defined in this document is designed to take
   advantage of the property of how Hop-by-Hop options are processed.
   Nodes that do not support this Option SHOULD ignore them.  This can
   mean that, in this case, the performance measurement does not account
   for all links and nodes along a path.  The definition of the Hop-by-
   Hop Options in this document is also designed to minimize throughput
   impact both on nodes that do not recognize the Option and on node
   that support it.  Indeed, the three high-order bits of the Options
   Header defined in this draft are 000 and, in theory, as per [RFC8200]
   and [I-D.hinden-6man-hbh-processing], this means "skip if do not
   recognize and data do not change en route".  [RFC8200] also mentions



Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   that the nodes only examine and process the Hop-by-Hop Options header
   if explicitly configured to do so.  For these reasons, this Hop-by-
   Hop Option should not affect the throughput.  However, in practice,
   it is important to be aware that the things may be different in the
   implementation and it can happen that packets with Hop-by-Hop are
   forced onto the slow path, but this is a general issue, as also
   explained in [I-D.hinden-6man-hbh-processing].  It is also worth
   mentioning that the application to a controlled domain should avoid
   the risk of arbitrary nodes dropping packets with Hop-by-Hop Options.

5.  Alternate Marking Method Operation

   This section describes how the method operates.  [RFC8321] introduces
   several applicable methods which are reported below, and a new field
   is introduced to facilitate the deployment and improve the
   scalability.

5.1.  Packet Loss Measurement

   The measurement of the packet loss is really straightforward in
   comparison to the existing mechanisms, as detailed in [RFC8321].  The
   packets of the flow are grouped into batches, and all the packets
   within a batch are marked by setting the L bit (Loss flag) to a same
   value.  The source node can switch the value of the L bit between 0
   and 1 after a fixed number of packets or according to a fixed timer,
   and this depends on the implementation.  The source node is the only
   one that marks the packets to create the batches, while the
   intermediate nodes only read the marking values and identify the
   packet batches.  By counting the number of packets in each batch and
   comparing the values measured by different network nodes along the
   path, it is possible to measure the packet loss occurred in any
   single batch between any two nodes.  Each batch represents a
   measurable entity recognizable by all network nodes along the path.

   Both fixed number of packets and fixed timer can be used by the
   source node to create packet batches.  But, as also explained in
   [RFC8321], the timer-based batches are preferable because they are
   more deterministic than the counter-based batches.  There is no
   definitive rule for counter-based batches, differently from timer-
   based batches.  Using a fixed timer for the switching offers better
   control over the method, indeed the length of the batches can be
   chosen large enough to simplify the collection and the comparison of
   the measures taken by different network nodes.  In the implementation
   the counters can be sent out by each node to the controller that is
   responsible for the calculation.  It is also possible to exchange
   this information by using other on-path techniques.  But this is out
   of scope for this document.

   Packets with different L values may get swapped at batch boundaries,
   and in this case, it is required that each marked packet can be
   assigned to the right batch by each router.  It is important to
   mention that for the application of this method there are two
   elements to consider: the clock error between network nodes and the
   network delay.  These can create offsets between the batches and out-
   of-order of the packets.  The mathematical formula on timing aspects,
   explained in section 3.2 of [RFC8321], must be satisfied and it takes
   into considerations the different causes of reordering such as clock
   error and network delay.  The assumption is to define the available
   counting interval where to get stable counters and to avoid these
   issues.  Specifically, if the effects of network delay are ignored,
   the condition to implement the methodology is that the clocks in
   different nodes MUST be synchronized to the same clock reference with
   an accuracy of +/- B/2 time units, where B is the fixed time duration
   of the batch, which refers to the original marking interval at the
   source node considering that this interval could fluctuate along the
   path.  In this way each marked packet can be assigned to the right
   batch by each node.  Usually the counters can be taken in the middle
   of the batch period to be sure to take still counters.  In a few
   words this implies that the length of the batches MUST be chosen
   large enough so that the method is not affected by those factors.
   The length of the batches can be determined based on the specific
   deployment scenario.

   It is worth mentioning that the duration of the batches is considered
   stable over time in the previous figure.  In theory, it is possible
   to change the length of batches over time and among different flows
   for more flexibility.  But, in practice, it could complicate the
   correlation of the information.

5.2.  Packet Delay Measurement

   The same principle used to measure packet loss can be applied also to
   one-way delay measurement.  Delay metrics MAY be calculated using the
   two possibilities:

   1.  Single-Marking Methodology: This approach uses only the L bit to
       calculate both packet loss and delay.  In this case, the D flag
       MUST be set to zero on transmit and ignored by the monitoring
       points.  The alternation of the values of the L bit can be used
       as a time reference to calculate the delay.  Whenever the L bit
       changes and a new batch starts, a network node can store the
       timestamp of the first packet of the new batch, that timestamp
       can be compared with the timestamp of the first packet of the
       same batch on a second node to compute packet delay.  But this
       measurement is accurate only if no packet loss occurs and if
       there is no packet reordering at the edges of the batches.  A
       different approach can also be considered and it is based on the
       concept of the mean delay.  The mean delay for each batch is
       calculated by considering the average arrival time of the packets
       for the relative batch.  There are limitations also in this case
       indeed, each node needs to collect all the timestamps and
       calculate the average timestamp for each batch.  In addition, the
       information is limited to a mean value.

   2.  Double-Marking Methodology: This approach is more complete and
       uses the L bit only to calculate packet loss and the D bit (Delay
       flag) is fully dedicated to delay measurements.  The idea is to
       use the first marking with the L bit to create the alternate flow
       and, within the batches identified by the L bit, a second marking
       is used to select the packets for measuring delay.  The D bit
       creates a new set of marked packets that are fully identified
       over the network, so that a network node can store the timestamps
       of these packets; these timestamps can be compared with the
       timestamps of the same packets on a second node to compute packet
       delay values for each packet.  The most efficient and robust mode
       is to select a single double-marked packet for each batch, in
       this way there is no time gap to consider between the double-
       marked packets to avoid their reorder.  Regarding the rule for
       the selection of the packet to be double-marked, the same
       considerations in Section 5.1 apply also here and the double-
       marked packet can be chosen within the available counting
       interval that is not affected by factors such as clock errors.
       If a double-marked packet is lost, the delay measurement for the
       considered batch is simply discarded, but this is not a big
       problem because it is easy to recognize the problematic batch and
       skip the measurement just for that one.  So in order to have more

       information about the delay and to overcome out-of-order issues
       this method is preferred.

   In summary the approach with double marking is better than the
   approach with single marking.  Moreover, the two approaches provide
   slightly different pieces of information and the data consumer can
   combine them to have a more robust data set.

   Similar to what said in Section 5.1 for the packet counters, in the
   implementation the timestamps can be sent out to the controller that
   is responsible for the calculation or could also be exchanged using
   other on-path techniques.  But this is out of scope for this
   document.

   Likewise to packet delay measurement (both for Single Marking and
   Double Marking), the method can also be used to measure the inter-
   arrival jitter.

5.3.  Flow Monitoring Identification

   The Flow Monitoring Identification (FlowMonID) identifies the flow to
   be measured and is required for some general reasons:

   o  First, it helps to reduce the per node configuration.  Otherwise,
      each node needs to configure an access-control list (ACL) for each
      of the monitored flows.  Moreover, using a flow identifier allows
      a flexible granularity for the flow definition, indeed, it can be
      used together with other identifiers (e.g. 5-tuple).




Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   o  Second, it simplifies the counters handling.  Hardware processing
      of flow tuples (and ACL matching) is challenging and often incurs
      into performance issues, especially in tunnel interfaces.

   o  Third, it eases the data export encapsulation and correlation for
      the collectors.

   The FlowMonID MUST only be used as a monitored flow identifier and
   two usage modes can be possible:

      * using just the FlowMonID for identification purpose.  This
      entails not only an easy identification but improved correlation
      as well;

      * using FlowMonID in combination with the tuples to identify a
      flow.  This also allows finer granularity and therefore adds
      flexibility to the flow identification.

   The FlowMon identifier field is to determine a monitored flow within
   the measurement domain.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a consistent
   approach in the implementation to avoid the mixture of different ways
   of identifying.  Therefore, all the nodes along the path and involved
   into the measurement SHOULD use the same mode for identification
   (FlowMonID alone or in combination with other identifiers).

   The FlowMonID field is set at the source node, which is the ingress
   point of the measurement domain, and can be set in two ways:

      * It can be assigned by the central controller.  Since the
      controller knows the network topology, it can set the value
      properly to avoid or minimize ambiguity and guarantee the
      uniqueness.  In this regard, the controller can simply verify that
      there is no ambiguity between different pseudo-randomly generated
      FlowMonIDs on the same path.

      * It can be algorithmically generated by the source node, that can
      set it pseudo-randomly with some chance of collision.  This
      approach cannot guarantee the uniqueness of FlowMonID but it may
      be preferred for local or private networks, where the conflict
      probability is small due to the large FlowMonID space.

   The value of 20 bits has been selected for the FlowMonID since it is
   a good compromise and implies a low rate of ambiguous FlowMonIDs that
   can be considered acceptable in most of the applications.  Indeed,
   with 20 bits the number of combinations is 1048576.

   If the FlowMonID is set by the source node, the intermediate nodes
   can read the FlowMonIDs from the packets in flight and act



Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   accordingly.  While, if the FlowMonID is set by the controller, both
   possibilities are feasible for the intermediate nodes which can learn
   by reading the packets or can be instructed by the controller.

   When all values in the FlowMonID space are consumed, the centralized
   controller can keep track and reassign the values that are not used
   any more by old flows, while if the FlowMonID is pseudo randomly
   generated by the source, conflicts and collisions are possible.

5.3.1.  Uniqueness of FlowMonID

   It is important to note that if the 20 bit FlowMonID is set
   independently and pseudo randomly there is a chance of collision.
   Indeed, by using the well-known birthday problem in probability
   theory, if the 20 bit FlowMonID is set independently and pseudo
   randomly without any additional input entropy, there is a 50% chance
   of collision for 1206 flows.  So, for more entropy, FlowMonID can
   either be combined with other identifying flow information in a
   packet (e.g. it is possible to consider the hashed 3-tuple Flow
   Label, Source and Destination addresses).

   This issue is more visible when the FlowMonID is pseudo randomly
   generated by the source node and there needs to tag it with
   additional flow information to allow disambiguation.  While, in case
   of a centralized controller, the controller should consider these
   aspects and instruct the nodes properly in order to guarantee its
   uniqueness.

   It is worth highlighting that in most of the applications a low rate
   of ambiguous FlowMonIDs can be acceptable, since this only affects
   the measurement.  For large scale measurements, where it is possible
   to monitor a big number of flows, the disambiguation of the FlowMonID
   field is something to take into account.

5.4.  Multipoint and Clustered Alternate Marking

   The Alternate Marking method can also be extended to any kind of
   multipoint to multipoint paths, and the network clustering approach
   allows a flexible and optimized performance measurement, as described
   in [RFC8889].

   The Cluster is the smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire
   Network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number of
   packets that goes in is the same that goes out.  With network
   clustering, it is possible to use the partition of the network into
   clusters at different levels in order to perform the needed degree of
   detail.  So, for Multipoint Alternate Marking, FlowMonID can identify




Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   in general a multipoint-to-multipoint flow and not only a point-to-
   point flow.

5.5.  Data Collection and Calculation

   The nodes enabled to perform performance monitoring collect the value
   of the packet counters and timestamps.  There are several
   alternatives to implement Data Collection and Calculation, but this
   is not specified in this document.

   There are documents on the control plane mechanisms of Alternate
   Marking, e.g.  [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-ifit],
   [I-D.chen-pce-pcep-ifit].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document aims to apply a method to perform measurements that
   does not directly affect Internet security nor applications that run
   on the Internet.  However, implementation of this method must be
   mindful of security and privacy concerns.

   There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by
   the measurements and potential harm to the measurements.

   Harm caused by the measurement: Alternate Marking implies
   modifications on the fly to an Option Header of IPv6 packets by the
   source node, but this must be performed in a way that does not alter
   the quality of service experienced by the packets and that preserves
   stability and performance of routers doing the measurements.  As
   already discussed in Section 4, it is RECOMMENDED that the AltMark
   Option does not affect the throughput and therefore the user
   experience.

   Harm to the measurement: Alternate Marking measurements could be
   harmed by routers altering the fields of the AltMark Option (e.g.
   marking of the packets, FlowMonID) or by a malicious attacker adding
   AltMark Option to the packets in order to consume the resources of
   network devices and entities involved.  As described above, the
   source node is the only one that writes the Option Header while the
   intermediate nodes and destination node only read it without
   modifying the Option Header.  But, for example, an on-path attacker
   can modify the flags, whether intentionally or accidentally, or
   deliberately insert a new option to the packet flow or delete the
   option from the packet flow.  The consequent effect could be to give
   the appearance of loss or delay or invalidate the measurement by
   modifying option identifiers, such as FlowMonID.  The malicious
   implication can be to cause actions from the network administrator
   where an intervention is not necessary or to hide real issues in the



Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   network.  Since the measurement itself may be affected by network
   nodes intentionally altering the bits of the AltMark Option or
   injecting Options headers as a means for Denial of Service (DoS), the
   Alternate Marking MUST be applied in the context of a controlled
   domain, where the network nodes are locally administered and this
   type of attack can be avoided.  For this reason, the implementation
   of the method is not done on the end node if it is not fully managed
   and does not belong to the controlled domain.  Packets generated
   outside the controlled domain may consume router resources by
   maliciously using the HbH Option, but this can be mitigated by
   filtering these packets at the controlled domain boundary.  This can
   be done because, if the end node does not belong to the controlled
   domain, it is not supposed to add the AltMark HbH Option, and it can
   be easily recognized.

   The flow identifier (FlowMonID) composes the AltMark Option together
   with the two marking bits (L and D).  As explained in Section 5.3.1,
   there is a chance of collision if the FlowMonID is set pseudo
   randomly and a solution exists.  In general this may not be a problem
   and a low rate of ambiguous FlowMonIDs can be acceptable, since this
   does not cause significant harm to the operators or their clients and
   this harm may not justify the complications of avoiding it.  But, for
   large scale measurements, a big number of flows could be monitored
   and the probability of a collision is higher, thus the disambiguation
   of the FlowMonID field can be considered.

   The privacy concerns also need to be analyzed even if the method only
   relies on information contained in the Option Header without any
   release of user data.  Indeed, from a confidentiality perspective,
   although AltMark Option does not contain user data, the metadata can
   be used for network reconnaissance to compromise the privacy of users
   by allowing attackers to collect information about network
   performance and network paths.  AltMark Option contains two kinds of
   metadata: the marking bits (L and D bits) and the flow identifier
   (FlowMonID).

      The marking bits are the small information that is exchanged
      between the network nodes.  Therefore, due to this intrinsic
      characteristic, network reconnaissance through passive
      eavesdropping on data-plane traffic is difficult.  Indeed, an
      attacker cannot gain information about network performance from a
      single monitoring point.  The only way for an attacker can be to
      eavesdrop on multiple monitoring points at the same time, because
      they have to do the same kind of calculation and aggregation as
      Alternate Marking requires.

      The FlowMonID field is used in the AltMark Option as the
      identifier of the monitored flow.  It represents a more sensitive



Fioccola, et al.         Expires March 18, 2022                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


      information for network reconnaissance and may allow a flow
      tracking type of attack because an attacker could collect
      information about network paths.

   Furthermore, in a pervasive surveillance attack, the information that
   can be derived over time is more.  But, as further described
   hereinafter, the application of the Alternate Marking to a controlled
   domain helps to mitigate all the above aspects of privacy concerns.

   At the management plane, attacks can be set up by misconfiguring or
   by maliciously configuring AltMark Option.  Thus, AltMark Option
   configuration MUST be secured in a way that authenticates authorized
   users and verifies the integrity of configuration procedures.
   Solutions to ensure the integrity of AltMark Option are outside the
   scope of this document.  Also, attacks on the reporting of the
   statistics between the monitoring points and the network management
   system (e.g. centralized controller) can interfere with the proper
   functioning of the system.  Hence, the channels used to report back
   flow statistics MUST be secured.

   As stated above, the precondition for the application of the
   Alternate Marking is that it MUST be applied in specific controlled
   domains, thus confining the potential attack vectors within the
   network domain.  [RFC8799] analyzes and discusses the trend towards
   network behaviors that can be applied only within a limited domain.
   This is due to the specific set of requirements especially related to
   security, network management, policies and options supported which
   may vary between such limited domains.  A limited administrative
   domain provides the network administrator with the means to select,
   monitor and control the access to the network, making it a trusted
   domain.  In this regard it is expected to enforce policies at the
   domain boundaries to filter both external packets with AltMark Option
   entering the domain and internal packets with AltMark Option leaving
   the domain.  Therefore, the trusted domain is unlikely subject to
   hijacking of packets since packets with AltMark Option are processed
   and used only within the controlled domain.

   As stated, the application to a controlled domain ensures the control
   over the packets entering and leaving the domain, but despite that,
   leakages may happen for different reasons, such as a failure or a
   fault.  In this case, nodes outside the domain MUST simply ignore
   packets with AltMark Option since they should not process it.

   Additionally, it is to be noted that the AltMark Option is carried by
   the Options Header and it may have some impact on the packet sizes
   for the monitored flow and on the path MTU, since some packets might
   exceed the MTU.  However, the relative small size (48 bit in total)

Internet-Draft                  IPv6 AMM                  September 2021


   of these Option Headers and its application to a controlled domain
   help to mitigate the problem.

   It is worth mentioning that the security concerns may change based on
   the specific deployment scenario and related threat analysis, which
   can lead to specific security solutions that are beyond the scope of
   this document.  As an example, the AltMark Option can be used as Hop-
   by-Hop or Destination Option and, in case of Destination Option,
   multiple administrative domains may be traversed by the AltMark
   Option that is not confined to a single administrative domain.  In
   this case, the user, aware of the kind of risks, may still want to
   use Alternate Marking for telemetry and test purposes but the
   controlled domain must be composed by more than one administrative
   domains.  To this end, the inter-domain links need to be secured
   (e.g., by IPsec, VPNs) in order to avoid external threats and realize
   the whole controlled domain.

   It might be theoretically possible to modulate the marking or the
   other fields of the AltMark Option to serve as a covert channel to be
   used by an on-path observer.  This may affect both the data and
   management plane, but, here too, the application to a controlled
   domain helps to reduce the effects.

   The Alternate Marking application described in this document relies
   on a time synchronization protocol.  Thus, by attacking the time
   protocol, an attacker can potentially compromise the integrity of the
   measurement.  A detailed discussion about the threats against time
   protocols and how to mitigate them is presented in [RFC7384].
   Network Time Security (NTS), described in [RFC8915], is a mechanism
   that can be employed.  Also, the time, which is distributed to the
   network nodes through the time protocol, is centrally taken from an
   external accurate time source, such as an atomic clock or a GPS
   clock.  By attacking the time source it can be possible to compromise
   the integrity of the measurement as well.  There are security
   measures that can be taken to mitigate the GPS spoofing attacks and a
   network administrator should certainly employ solutions to secure the
   network domain.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The Option Type should be assigned in IANA's "Destination Options and
   Hop-by-Hop Options" registry.

   This draft requests the following IPv6 Option Type assignment from
   the Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options sub-registry of
