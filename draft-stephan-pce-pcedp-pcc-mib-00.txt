1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing Path
   Computation Elements (PCEs) Discovery Protocol inside a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) application.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL", when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document.

   Domain: any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
   address management or path computational responsibility.

   IGP Area: OSPF Area or ISIS level.

   PCC: Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
   path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE: Path Computation Element: an entity (component, application, or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph, and applying computational constraints.

5.  Overview

   [I-D.ietf-pce-architecture], describes the architecture for a PCE-
   based path computation model for MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs.  The
   architecture allows the separation of PCE from PCC.  It requires that
   a PCC be aware of the location of one or more PCEs.  This relies on a
   communication protocol between PCC and PCE for automatic and dynamic
   PCE discovery.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-discovery-reqs] defines the mechanism and the
   information of PCE discovery.  [I-D.ietf-pce-disco-proto-igp]
   declines theses components for PCCs participating to an IGP routing
   domain:

   o  The discovery mechanism relies on IGP (OSPF, ISIS) advertisements;
   o  It defines the information elements a PCE participating in the IGP
      advertises in IGP extensions.

   The section "6.10.2.1.  PCC MIB module " of [I-D.ietf-pce-discovery-
   reqs] identifies the information to be disclosed on the management
   interface of the PCC.  The current MIB module defines the
   corresponding objects.

   It provides a PCE the capability to advertise several types of
   informations:

   o  its location;
   o  information useful for PCE selection;
   o  information useful to satisfy dynamic PCE discovery;
   o  PCE processing congestion state;
   o


6.  Structure of the MIB Module

   Objects in this MIB module are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups, and the intended purpose of
   each group, is shown below.

   The MIB module that will run on PCCs MUST include at least: - A
   control to disable automatic discovery by the PCC; - The set of known
   PCEs; - The number of known PCEs, and the number of discovered PCEs.
   For each PCE reported in the MIB module, the following information
   MUST be available: - Information advertised by the PCE (i.e.,
   discovered information); - Information locally configured about the
   PCE; - The time since the PCE was discovered; - The time since any
   change to the discovered information for the PCE; Note that when a

   PCE is no longer alive (see section 6.4), it SHOULD no longer be
   reported in the PCC MIB module.  The MIB module SHOULD also provide
   the average and maximum rates of arrival, departure and modification
   of PCE discovery to enable effective analysis of the operation of the
   protocols.  Further, the MIB module SHOULD report on the operation of
   the discovery protocol by counting the number of unacceptable and
   incomprehensible information exchanges.  The PCC MIB module SHOULD
   also be used to provide notifications when thresholds (e.g. on the
   maximum rate of change, on the number of unacceptable messages) are
   crossed, or when important events occur (e.g. the number of
   discovered PCEs decreases to zero).

6.1.  Textual Conventions

6.2.  The PCEs Discovery Group

   This group provides general PCEs information such as their location,
   domains supported and inter-domain functions.

6.3.  The PCEs capabilities Group

   This group provides detailed PCEs information.  It is not part of PCE
   discovery.

   This comprises any or all information about PCE path computation
   capabilities and alternate PCEs.

6.4.  The PCEs activities Group

   This group provides PCEs activity information.  It defines the
   average and maximum rates of arrival, departure and modification of
   PCE discovery to enable effective analysis of the operation of the
   protocols.  Its report on the operation of the discovery protocol by
   counting the number of unacceptable and incomprehensible information
   exchanges.

6.5.  The Notification Group

   This group defines notifications when thresholds (e.g. on the maximum
   rate of change, on the number of unacceptable messages) are crossed,
   or when important events occur (e.g. the number of discovered PCEs
   decreases to zero).

7.1.  Relationship to  IGP MIB modules

   PCEDP relies on existing protocols which have specialized MIB objects
   to monitor protocol activities.  Consequently this document considers
   that the monitoring of the undelying protocol in out of the scope of
   the current MIB module.

7.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB [RFC2863] and
   also REFERENCEs document RFC0768 [RFC0768]

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   o  on/off of discovery : Unauthorized changes to
      cedpPccPceDiscoveryAdminStatus could result in a temporary
      interruption of the discovery ;

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   o  IP addresses of PCE.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

Internet-Draft                PCEDP PCC MIB                    June 2006


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   This list of open issues should be cleared and removed before this
   document hits the IESG.

A.1.  pcedpPccPceDiscoveryTable

   1.  Is the activation/desactivation of discovery allowed when an
       agent complies to pcedpPccGeneralPceInformationOnlyCompliance ?
   2.  What happen when cedpPccPceDiscoveryAdminStatus is set to
       disabled ?  Do we delete all PCEs discovered dynamically ?
   3.  pcedpPccPceDomains & pcedpPccPceDestDomains: Do we need separate
       tables ?
   4.  Do we need a type of entry static/dynamic ?


Appendix B.  MIB module document template usage

   This section must be removed before this document hits the IESG.

   This section has nothing todo with PCE WG but with MIB document
   editing, MIB module editing, Bill Fenner xxe pluging and xml2rfc.

   Prior to the edition of the document the author iniitaited a
   discussion with the Rfc-editor regarding the way to write SMI

   definition in XML.  This discussion has 2 results:
   1.  This document use parts of the "MIB Module Document Template"
       [I-D.harrington-text-mib-doc-template] edited by David
       Harrington;
   2.  Regarding xml2rfc usage, currently MIB objets are writen in raw
       text encapsulated in XML <figure> and <artwork> tokens. this is
       against the spirit of xml2rfc because the editor must take of the
       formating of the text.  So I writen the objects definition using
       XML <list> tokens to let xml2rfc deals with the formating of the
       document.  Note that it does not affect the .txt version of the
       draft.

   Following are comments related to The MIB module template the author
   collected during the editing:

   1.  The MIB module template should help to determine which SNMP and
       SMI rfc are normative or informative.
   2.
