1.  Introduction

   In some environments email messages can't be released to the MTS
   (Mail Transfer System) and, thus delivered to recipients, unless they
   are authorized by one or more authorizing users (e.g.  Releasing
   Officers or Release Authorities).  This document describes how such
   Draft messages can be represented as Internet Email [RFC5322] MIME
   objects [RFC2045].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of
   RFC 5234 [RFC5234].  Terms not defined in this document are taken
   from [RFC5322].

2.1.  Terminology

   Drafter: Any email user that composes a message (Draft Message)
   needing authorisation before it is released to its intended
   recipients.

   Authorizing User (also Releaser or Authorizer): The mailbox of a user
   or a group of users that must inspect and authorise the release of
   Draft Message before it can be sent.  An organization may require

Internet-Draft       Draft & Release email messages        December 2015


   more than one Authorizing User to authorize release of a Draft
   Message.

3.  Structure of a draft message

   Message encapsulating a draft message to be released or reviewed
   (a.k.a. "outer message") is constructed as follows:

   1.  The media type of the outer message is "multipart/mixed".

   2.  The outer message contains the Message-Draft header field
       Section 5.  The initial message for release/review would contain
       "For Release", "For Confirmed Release" or "For Review" in this
       header field.  [[CREF1: Is "For Confirmed Release" needed?  Use
       MDN request instead?]]

   3.  (REQUIRED) The first body part of the outer message contains a
       human-readable message.  The purpose of this message is to convey
       information about the inner draft message from the drafter to
       authorizing user.  This body part can use any IANA-registered
       MIME media type, charset, or language.  But this body part is
       typically "text/plain".  Where a description of the error is
       desired in several languages or several media, a "multipart/
       alternative" construct can be used.

   4.  (REQUIRED) The second body part is "message/rfc822" or "message/
       global".  It wraps the draft message to be released.  The draft
       message can contain MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field
       [I-D.melnikov-mmhs-authorizing-users].

   5.  (OPTIONAL) The third and subsequent body parts contain comments
       from reviewers and/or authorizing users.  These body parts are
       typically "text/plain" or "text/html".

4.  Structure of a confirmation message

   1.  The media type of the message confirming that the origina draft
       message was released, reviewed or rejected can be or any media
       type.

   2.  The message includes the Message-Draft header field Section 5
       containing one of "Authorized", "Reviewed" or "Rejected".

   3.  The message should contain "In-Reply-To:" header field with the
       Message-ID of the original draft message.

Internet-Draft       Draft & Release email messages        December 2015


5.  Message-Draft header field

   Message-Draft specifies what should be done with a draft message or
   what was already done with it.

   This message header can appear at most once in the header.


       Message-Draft = "Message-Draft:"
                          [FWS] Message-Draft-Type [FWS] CRLF

       Message-Draft-Type = "For Release" /
                            "For Confirmed Release" /
                            "For Review" /
                            "Authorized" /
                            "Reviewed" /
                            "Rejected"

6.  Registration of new IMAP Keywords

   This document defines several new IMAP keywords that can be used to
   override values stored in the Message-Draft header field.  (I.e. if
   one of these mutually exclusive keywords is found, they take
   precedence over the value specified in the Message-Draft header
   field.)  This allow client developers to implement easier draft &
   release workflow without requiring to re-upload the modified message
   with IMAP APPEND command.

   All of the following IMAP keywords are mutually exclusive:

      $DraftAuthorized corresponds to the "Authorized" value of the
      Message-Draft header field;

      $DraftReviewed corresponds to the "Reviewed" value of the Message-
      Draft header field;

      $DraftRejected corresponds to the "Rejected" value of the Message-
      Draft header field.

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.  Need to register IMAP keywords with IANA.

8.1.  The Message-Draft Header Field registration

   IANA is requested to add the Message-Draft header field to the IANA
   "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry, per the procedure
   found in [RFC3864].  That entry is to be updated to reference this
   document.  The following is the registration template:

      Header field name: Message-Draft

8.2.  $DraftAuthorized IMAP keyword registration

   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword $DraftAuthorized



   IMAP keyword name:  $DraftAuthorized



   Purpose (description):  The $DraftAuthorized IMAP keyword designates
               the message requiring authorization for release as
               authorized (processed).



   Private or Shared on a server:  SHARED



   Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:  When
               this keyword is set, it means that the message is already
               authorized and doesn't need any action.  Lack of both
               $DraftAuthorized and $DraftRejected can cause the client
               to popup a dialog or show some other UI for authorizing
               release of a message.



   When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:  This keyword is set by an
               email client when the message is authorized.



   Related keywords:  $DraftRejected

   Note:

               $DraftAuthorized and $DraftRejected are mutually
               exclusive.  If more than one of them is set for a
               message, the mail client MUST treat this as if neither of
               them is set and SHOULD remove both of them from the IMAP
               server.

8.3.  $DraftRejected IMAP keyword registration

   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword $DraftRejected



   IMAP keyword name:  $DraftRejected



   Purpose (description):  The $DraftRejected IMAP keyword designates
               the message requiring authorization for release as
               rejected by authorizer (processed).
