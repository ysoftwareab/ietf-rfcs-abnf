<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led
	to the creation of shared blacklists and whitelists of IP addresses
	or domains.
	The DNS has become a de-facto standard method of distributing these
	blacklists and whitelists.
	This memo documents the structure and usage of DNS based blacklists and
	whitelists, and the protocol used to query them.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>In 1997, Dave Rand and Paul Vixie,
       well known Internet software engineers, started
       keeping a list of IP addresses that had sent them spam or engaged in
       other behavior that they found objectionable.
       Word of the list quickly spread, and they started distributing it as a
       BGP feed for people who wanted to block all traffic from listed IP
       addresses at their routers.
       The list became known as the Real-time Blackhole List (RBL).
</p>
<p>Many network managers wanted to use the RBL to block unwanted e-mail,
       but weren't prepared to use a BGP feed.
       Rand and Vixie created a DNS-based distribution scheme that quickly became
       more popular than the original BGP distribution.
       Other people created other DNS-based blacklists either to compete
       with the RBL or to complement it by listing different categories of
       IP addresses.
       Although some people refer to all DNS-based blacklists as ``RBLs'',
       the term properly is used for the MAPS RBL, the descendant of the
       original list.
       (In the United States, the term RBL is a registered service mark of Trend
       Micro<a class='info' href='#MAPSRBL'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;MAPS RBL+,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.)
</p>
<p>The conventional term is now DNS Blacklist or Blocklist, or DNSBL.
       Some people also publish DNS-based whitelists or DNSWLs.
       Network managers typically use DNSBLs to block traffic and
       DNSWLs to preferentially accept traffic.
       The structure of a DNSBL and DNSWL are the same,
       so in the subsequent discussion
       we use the abbreviation DNSxL to mean either.
</p>
<p>This document describes existing practice but does not define a standard of any sort.
       It describes the structure, operation, and use of DNSBLs and
       DNSWLs but does not describe or recommend policies for adding or
       removing addresses to and from DNSBLs and DNSWLs, nor does it recommend policies
       for using them, nor does it take a position on
       whether the DNS is the best way to distribute such data.
       We anticipate that management policies will be addressed in a companion
       document.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Structure of an IP address DNSBL or DNSWL</h3>

<p>A DNSxL is a DNS zone containing
       resource records corresponding
       to hosts present in a blacklist or whitelist.
       Hosts were originally encoded into DNSxL zones
       using a transformation of their IP addresses,
       but now host names are sometimes encoded as well.
       Most DNSxLs still use IP addresses.
</p>
<a name="anchor3"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
IP address DNSxL</h3>

<p>An IP address DNSxL has a structure adapted from that of the rDNS.
       (The rDNS, reverse DNS, is the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA domains
       used to map IP addresses to domain names.)
       Each IP address listed in the DNSxL has a corresponding DNS entry
       created by reversing the order of the octets of the text representation
       of the IP address, and appending the domain name of the DNSxL.
</p>
<p>If, for example, the DNSxL is called bad.example.com, and the IP
       address to be listed is 192.0.2.99, the name of the DNS entry would
       be 99.2.0.192.bad.example.com.
       Each entry in the DNSxL has an A record and often a TXT record.
       The A record conventionally has the value 127.0.0.2, but may have
       other values as described below in Combined IP address DNSxLs.
       The TXT record describes the reason that the IP is listed in the DNSxL,
       and is often used as the text of an SMTP error response when an SMTP
       client attempts to send mail to a server using the list as a DNSBL,
       or as explanatory text when the DNSBL is used in a scoring spam filter,
       for example:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
99.2.0.192.bad.example.com    A      127.0.0.2
99.2.0.192.bad.example.com    TXT
         "Dynamic address, see http://bad.example.com?192.0.2.99"
</pre></div>
<p>Some DNSxLs use the same TXT record for all entries,
       while others provide a different TXT record for each entry or range
       of entries that describes the reason that entry or range is listed.
       The reason often includes the URL of a web page where more information
       is available.
       Some client software only checks the A record, some only checks the TXT
       record, some checks both.
</p>
<p>If a range of addresses is listed in the DNSxL, 
       the DNSxL contains a record
       (or a pair of A and TXT records) for every address in the DNSxL.
       Conversely,
       if an IP address is not listed in the DNSxL, there is no record for
       the address.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
IP address DNSWL</h3>

<p>Since SMTP has no standard way for a server to advise a client why a request
       was accepted, TXT records in DNSWLs are not very useful.
       Some DNSWLs contain TXT records anyway to document the
       reasons that entries are present.
</p>
<p>It is possible and occasionally useful for a DNSxL to be used as a DNSBL in one
       context and a DNSWL in another.
       For example, a DNSxL that lists the IP addresses assigned to dynamically
       assigned addresses on a particular network might be used as a DNSWL on that network's
       outgoing mail server or intranet web server, and used as a DNSBL for mail servers
       on other networks.
</p>
<a name="anchor5"></a><br /><hr />

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Combined IP address DNSxLs</h3>

<p>In many cases, an organization maintains a DNSxL that contains
       multiple entry types, with the entries of each type constituting a sublist.
       For example, an organization that publishes a DNSBL listing
       sources of unwanted e-mail may wish to indicate why various addresses are
       included in the list, with one sublist for addresses listed due to sender
       policy, a second list for addresses of open relays, a third list for hosts
       compromised by malware, and so forth.
       (At this point all of the DNSxLs with sublists of which we are aware are
       intended for use as DNSBLs, but the sublist techniques are equally usable
       for DNSWLs.)
</p>
<p>There are three common methods of representing a DNSxL with multiple sublists:
       subdomains, multiple A
       records, and bit encoded entries.
       Most DNSxLs with sublists use both subdomains and one of the other methods.
</p>
<p>Sublist subdomains are merely subdomains of the main DNSxL domain.
       If for example, bad.example.com had two sublists relay and malware,
       entries for 
       192.0.2.99 would be 99.2.0.192.relay.bad.example.com
       or 99.2.0.192.malware.bad.example.com.
       Sublist names contain non-digits, so there is no problem of name collisions with
       entries in the main domain, where the IP addresses consist of digits.
</p>
<p>To minimize the number of DNS lookups, multiple sublists can also be encoded as bit masks or multiple
       A records.
       With bit masks, the A record entry for each IP is the logical OR of the bit masks for all of the lists on
       which the IP appears.
       For example, the bit masks for the two sublists might be 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.0.2, in which case
       an entry for an IP on both lists would be 127.0.0.3:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
99.2.0.192.bad.example.com    A      127.0.0.3
</pre></div>
<p>With multiple A records, each sublist has a different assigned value
       such as 127.0.1.1, 127.0.1.2, and so forth,
       with an A record for each sublist on which the IP appears:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
99.2.0.192.bad.example.com    A      127.0.0.1
99.2.0.192.bad.example.com    A      127.0.0.2
</pre></div>
<p>There is no widely used convention for mapping sublist names to bits
       or values, beyond the convention that all A values are in the
       127.0.0.0/8 range to prevent unwanted network traffic if the value is
       accidentally used as an IP address.
</p>
<p>DNSxLs that return multiple A records sometimes return multiple TXT
       records as well, although the lack of any way to match the TXT records
       to the A records limits the usefulness of those TXT records.  Other
       combined DNSxLs return a single TXT record.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
DNSxL cache behavior</h3>

<p>The per-record time-to-live and zone refresh intervals of
       DNSBLs and DNSWLs vary greatly depending on the management policy of
       the list.  A list of IP addresses assigned to dynamically allocated
       dialup and DHCP users could be expected to change slowly, so the TTL
       might be several days and the zone refreshed once a day.  On the other
       hand, a list of IP addresses that had been observed sending spam might
       change every few minutes, with comparably short TTL and refresh
       intervals.

<a name="rfc.section.2.5"></a><h3>2.5.&nbsp;
Test and contact addresses</h3>

<p>Nearly all IP based DNSxLs contain an entry for 127.0.0.2 for testing purposes.
       DNSBLs that return multiple values often have multiple test addresses so that,
       for example, a DNSBL that can return 127.0.0.5 would have a test
       record for 127.0.0.5 that returns an A record
       with the value 127.0.0.5, and a corresponding TXT record.
</p>
<p>Most DNSxLs also contain an A record at the apex of the DNSxL zone
       that points to a web server, so that
       anyone wishing to learn about the bad.example.net DNSBL can check http://bad.example.net.

IPv6 DNSxLs</h3>

<p>No DNSxL based on IPv6 addresses has, to the best of our knowledge, been
       deployed yet.
       The obvious format for one would use 32-component hex nibble-reversed IPv6
       addresses in the same places where
       IPv4 DNSxLs use four-component decimal byte-reversed addresses.
       A single DNSxL could in principle contain both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
       since the different lengths prevent any ambiguity.
       If a DNSxL is represented using traditional zone files and wildcards,
       there is no way to specify the length of the name that a wildcard matches,
       so wildcard names would indeed be ambiguous for DNSxLs served in that fashion.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Domain name DNSxLs</h3>

<p>A few DNSxLs list domain names rather than IP addresses.
       They are sometimes called RHSBLs, for right hand side blacklists.
       The names of their entries contain the listed domain name followed by the name of the DNSxL.
       If the DNSxL were called doms.example.net, and the domain invalid.edu were to be listed, the
       entry would be named invalid.edu.doms.example.net:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
invalid.edu.doms.example.net    A      127.0.0.2
invalid.edu.doms.example.net    TXT    "Host name used in phish"
</pre></div>
<p>A few name-based DNSBLs encode e-mail addresses using a convention
adopted from DNS SOA records, so an entry for fred@invalid.edu would
have the name fred.invalid.edu.doms.example.net:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
fred.invalid.edu.doms.example.net    A      127.0.0.2
</pre></div>
<p>There is no consistent convention for a test entry,
       but some name-based DNSxLs use EXAMPLE.COM as a test entry.
       Name-based DNSBLs are far less common than IP based DNSBLs.
       There is no agreed convention for wildcards.
</p>
<p>Name-based DNSWLs can be created in the same manner as DNSBLs,
and have been used as simple reputation systems with the values of octets
       in the A record representing reputation scores and confidence values,
       typically on a 0-100 or 0-255 scale.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Typical usage of DNSBLs and DNSWLs</h3>

<p>DNSxLs can be served either from standard DNS servers, or from specialized
servers like <a class='info' href='#RBLDNS'>rbldns<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bernstein, D., &ldquo;rbldns, in &quot;djbdns&quot;,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [2]
and <a class='info' href='#RBLDNSD'>rbldnsd<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tokarev, M., &ldquo;rbldnsd: Small Daemon for DNSBLs,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [4]
that accept lists of IP addresses and CIDR ranges
and synthesize the appropriate DNS records on the fly.
Organizations that make heavy use of a DNSxL usually arrange for a private
mirror of the DNSxL, either using the standard AXFR and IXFR or by fetching
a file containing addresses and CIDR ranges for the specialized servers.
If a /24 or larger range of addresses is listed, and the
zone's server uses traditional zone files to represent the DNSxL, the DNSxL
may use wildcards to limit the size of the zone file.  If for example,
the entire range of 192.0.2.0/24 were listed, the DNSxL's zone could
contain a single wildcard for *.2.0.192.bad.example.com.
</p>
<p>DNSBL clients are most often mail servers or spam filters called from mail servers.
There's no requirement that DNSBLs be used only for mail, and other services such as IRC use
them to check client hosts that attempt to connect to a server.
</p>
<p>Mail servers that test combined lists most often handle them the same as single lists
and treat any A or TXT record as meaning that an IP is listed without distinguishing among the
various reasons it might have been listed.
Some mail server and spam filtering software does have the ability to
apply bit masks to retrieved
A values in order to select particular sublists of a combined list.
</p>
<p>Mail servers typically check a list of DNSxLs on every incoming SMTP connection, with the
names of the DNSxLs set in the server's configuration.
A common usage pattern is for
the server to check each list in turn until it finds one with a DNSBL entry, in which case it
rejects the connection, or a DNSWL entry in which case it accepts the connection.
If the address appears on no list at all (the usual case for legitimate mail),
the mail server accepts the connection.
In another approach, DNSxL entries are used as inputs to a weighting function
that computes an overall score for each message.
</p>
<p>The mail server uses its normal local DNS cache to limit traffic to the DNSxL servers and
to speed up retests of IP addresses recently seen.
Long-running mail servers may cache DNSxL data internally.
</p>
<p>An alternate approach is to check DNSxLs in a spam filtering package after a message
has been received.
In that case, the IP(s) to test are usually extracted from "Received:" header fields
or URIs in the body of the message.  The DNSxL
results may be used to make a binary accept/reject decision, or in a scoring system.
</p>
<p>Packages that test multiple header fields need to be able to distinguish among values in lists with sublists
since, for example, an entry indicating that an IP is assigned to dialup users might be treated
as a strong indication that a message should be rejected if the IP sends mail directly to the recipient
system, but not if the message were relayed through an ISP's mail server.
</p>
<p>Name-based DNSBLs have been used both to check domain names of e-mail addresses
and host names found in mail headers, and to check the domains found in URLs
in message bodies.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Any system manager that uses DNSxLs is entrusting part of his or her server management
to the parties that run the lists.
A DNSBL manager that decided to list 0/0 (which has actually happened) could cause every server
that uses the DNSBL to reject all mail.
Conversely, if a DNSBL manager removes all of the entries (which has also happened), systems that
depend on the DNSBL will find that their filtering doesn't work as they want it to.
</p>
<p>Since DNSxL users usually make a query for every incoming e-mail message,
the operator of a DNSxL can extract approximate mail volume statistics
from the DNS server logs.
This has been used in a few instances to estimate the amount of mail
individual IPs or IP blocks send<a class='info' href='#SENDERBASE'>[5]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ironport Systems, &ldquo;Senderbase,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>

<p>As with any other DNS based services, DNSBLs and DNSWLs are subject to 
various types of DNS attacks which are described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3833'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Atkins, D. and R. Austein, &ldquo;Threat Analysis of the Domain Name System (DNS),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
