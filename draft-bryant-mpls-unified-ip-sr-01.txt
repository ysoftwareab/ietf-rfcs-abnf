                A Unified Approach to IP Segment Routing
                   draft-bryant-mpls-unified-ip-sr-01

Abstract

   Segment routing is a source routed forwarding method that allows
   packets to be steered through a network on paths other than the
   shortest path derived from the routing protocol.  The approach uses
   information encoded in the packet header to partially or completely
   specify the route the packet takes through the network, and does not
   make use of a signaling protocol to pre-install paths in the network.

   Two different encapsulations have been defined to enable segment
   routing in an MPLS network and in an IPv6 network.  While
   acknowledging that there is a strong need to support segment routing
   in both environments, this document defines a converged, unified
   approach to segment routing that enables a single mechanism to be
   applied in both types of network.  The resulting approach is also
   applicable to IPv4 networks without the need for any changes to the
   IPv4 specification.

   This document makes no changes to the segment routing architecture
   and builds on existing protocol mechanisms such as the encapsulation
   of MPLS within UDP defined in RFC 7510.

   No new procedures are introduced, but existing mechanisms are
   combined to achieve the desired result.

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] is a source
   routed forwarding method that allows packets to be steered through a
   network on paths other than the shortest path derived from the
   routing protocol.  SR also allows the packets to be steered through a
   set of packet processing functions along that path.  SR uses
   information encoded in the packet header to partially or completely
   specify the route the packet takes through the network and does not
   make use of a signaling protocol to pre-install paths in the network.

   MPLS-SPRING [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls] (also known as
   MPLS Segment Routing or MPLS-SR) encodes the route the packet takes
   through the network and the instructions to be applied to the packet
   as it transits the network by imposing a stack of MPLS label entries
   on the packet.

   The approach to IPv6 segment routing (SR) described in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] proposes that the segment
   routing instruction list is encoded as an ordered list of 128-bit
   IPv6 addresses that is carried in a new IPv6 extension header: the
   Source Routing Header (SRH).  This approach can be challenging to
   implement in some types of forwarder, particularly where a large
   number of instructions/segments are needed to specify the required
   behaviour.  Furthermore, the approach does not allow the use of SR
   techniques in legacy IPv4 networks.  In this document we describe a
   method for running SR in IP networks that has a lower overhead and
   that uses an MPLS label stack carried in UDP as a method of encoding
   the segment routing instructions to be executed as the packet
   traverses the network.  We call this Unified Segment Routing (USR)
   because the same instruction encoding method can be applied to MPLS,
   IPv4, and IPv6.

   The format defined in this document uses 32 bits per additional
   instruction compared to the 128 bits for the method described in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].  The methods are further
   compared in Section 9.

   The sequence of 32 bit units, one for each instruction, is called the
   Segment Routing Instruction Stack (SRIS).  Each basic unit is encoded

Internet-Draft            Unified SR using MPLS              August 2017


   as an MPLS label stack entry and the segment routing instructions
   (i.e., the Segment Identifiers, SIDs) are encoded in the 20 bit MPLS
   Label fields.  This is a hardware convenience rather than an
   indication of the use of MPLS as a forwarding protocol and the MPLS
   protocol stack, and in particular the MPLS control protocols, do not
   need to be deployed.  It is a hardware convenience because many
   hardware components are already able to perform lookups based on MPLS
   labels.

   In summary, the processing described in this document is a
   combination of normal MPLS-over-UDP behavior as described in
   [RFC7510], MPLS-SR lookup and label-pop behavior as described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls], and normal IP forwarding.  No
   new procedures are introduced, but existing mechanisms are combined
   to achieve the desired result.

   The method defined is a complementary way of running SR in an IP
   network that can be used alongside or interchangeably with that
   defined in [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].  Implementers and
   deployers should consider the benefits and drawbacks of each method
   and select the approach most suited to their needs.

2.  The Unified Segment Routing Protocol Stack

   The USR protocol stack is shown in Figure 1.

                      Figure 1: Packet Encapsulation

   The payload may be of any type that, with an appropriate convergence
   layer, can be carried over a packet network.  It is anticipated that
   the most common packet types will be IPv4, IPv6, native MPLS, and
   pseudowires [RFC3985].

   Preceding the Payload is the Segment Routing Instruction Stack (SRIS)
   that carries the sequence of instructions to be executed on the
   packet as it traverses the network.  This is the Segment Identifier
   (SID) stack that is the ordered list of segments described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].

   Preceding the SRIS is a UDP header.  The UDP header is included to:

   o  Introduce entropy to allow equal-cost multi-path load balancing
      (ECMP) [RFC2992] in the IP layer [RFC7510].

   o  Provide a protocol multiplexing layer as an alternative to using a
      new IP type/next header.

   o  Allow transit through firewalls and other middleboxes.

   o  Provide disagregation.

Internet-Draft            Unified SR using MPLS              August 2017


   Preceding the UDP header is the IP header which may be IPv4 or IPv6.

3.  The Segment Routing Instruction Stack

   The SRIS consists of a sequence of Segment Identifiers as described
   in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] encoded as an MPLS label stack
   as described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].

   The top SRIS entry is the next instruction to be executed.  When the
   node to which this instruction is directed has processed the
   instruction it is removed (popped) from the SRIS, and the next
   instruction processed.

   Each instruction is encoded in a single Label Stack Entry (LSE) as
   shown in Figure 2.  The structure of the LSE is unchanged from
   [RFC3032].


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Instruction                  | TC  |S|   TTL     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Instruction:  Label Value, 20 bits
                   TC:           Traffic Class, 3 bits
                   S:            Bottom of Stack, 1 bit
                   TTL:          Time to Live, 8 bits


                     Figure 2: SRIS Label Stack Entry

   As with [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls] a 32 bit LSE is used
   to carry each SR instruction.  The instruction itself is carried in
   the 20 bit Label Value field.  The TC field has the normal meaning as
   defined in [RFC3032] and modified in [RFC5462].  The S bit has bottom
   of stack semantics defined in [RFC3032].  TTL is discussed in
   Section 3.1.

3.1.  TTL

   The setting of the TTL is application specific, but the following
   operational consideration should be born in mind.  In SR the size of
   the label stack may be increased within a single routing domain by
   various operations such as the pushing of a binding SID.  Furthermore
   in SR packets are not necessarily constrained to travel on the
   shortest path with that routing domain.  Consideration therefore has
   to be given to possibility of a forwarding loop.  To mitigate against



Bryant, et al.          Expires February 12, 2018               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Unified SR using MPLS              August 2017


   this it is RECOMMENDED that the TTL is continuously decremented as
   the packet passes through the SR network regardless of any other
   changes to the network layer encapsulation.

4.  UDP/IP Encapsulation.

   The procedures defined in [RFC7510] are followed.  RFC7510 specifies
   the values to be used in the UDP Source Port, Destination Port, and
   Checksum fields.

   An administrative domain, or set of administrative domains that are
   sufficiently well managed and monitored to be able to safely use IP
   segment routing is likely to comply with the requirements called out
   in [RFC7510] to permit operation with a zero checksum over IPv6.
   However each operator needs to validate the decision on whether or
   not to use a UDP checksum for themselves.

   The [RFC7510] UDP header may be carried over IPv4 or over IPv6.

   The IP source address is the address of the encapsulating device.
   The IP destination address is implied by the instruction at the top
   of the instruction stack.

   If IPv4 is in use, fragmentation is not permitted.

5.  Elements of Procedure

   There are six type of node in an SR domain:

   o  Domain ingress nodes that receive packets and encapsulate them for
      transmission across the domain.  These packets may be native IP
      packets or may already be SR packets.

   o  Legacy transit nodes that are IP routers but are not able to
      perform segment routing.

   o  Transit nodes that are SR capable but that are not identified by a
      SID in the SID stack.

   o  Transit nodes that are SR capable and need to perform SR routing.

   o  The penultimate SR capable node on the path that processes the
      last SID on the stack.

   o  The domain egress node that forwards the payload packet for
      ultimate delivery.

Internet-Draft            Unified SR using MPLS              August 2017


   The following sub-sections describe the processing behavior in each
   case.

   In summary, the processing is a combination of normal MPLS-over-UDP
   behavior as described in [RFC7510], MPLS-SR lookup and label-pop
   behavior as described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls], and
   normal IP forwarding.  No new procedures are introduced, but existing
   mechanisms ae combined to achieve the desired result.

   The descriptions in the following sections represent the functional
   behavior.  Optimizations on this behavior may be possible in
   implementations.

5.1.  Domain Ingress

   Domain ingress nodes receive packets from outside the domain and
   encapsulate them to be forwarded across the domain.  Received packets
   may already be MPLS-SR packets (in the case of connecting two MPLS-SR
   networks across a native IP network), or may be IP or MPLS packets.

   In the latter case, the packet is classified by the domain ingress
   node and an MPLS-SR stack is imposed.  In the former case the MPLS-SR
   stack is already in the packet.  The top entry in the stack is popped
   from the stack and retained for use below.

   The packet is then encapsulated in UDP with the destination port set
   to 6635 to indicate "MPLS-UDP" as described in [RFC7510].  The source
   UDP port is set randomly or to provide entropy as described in
   [RFC7510].

   The packet is then encapsulated in IP for transmission across the
   network.  The IP source address is set to the domain ingress node,
   and the destination address is set to the address corresponding to
   the label that was previously popped from the stack.

   This corresponds to sending the packet out of a virtual interface
   that corresponds to a virtual link between the ingress node and the
   next hop SR node realized by a UDP tunnel.

   The packet is then sent into the IP network and is routed according
   to the local FIB and applying hashing to resolve any ECMP choices.

5.2.  Legacy Transit

   A legacy transit node is an IP router that has no SR capabilities.
   When such a router receives an MPLS-SR-in-UDP packet it will carry
   out normal TTL processing and if the packet is still live it will
   forward it as it would any other UDP-in-IP packet.  The packet will



Bryant, et al.          Expires February 12, 2018               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            Unified SR using MPLS              August 2017


   be routed toward the destination indicated in the packet header using
   the local FIB and applying hashing to resolve any ECMP choices.

   If the packet is mistakenly addressed to the legacy router, the UDP
   tunnel will be terminated and the packet will be discarded either
   because the MPLS-in-UDP port is not supported or because the
   uncovered top label has not been allocated.  This is, however, a
   misconnection and should not occur unless there is a routing error.

5.3.  On-Path Pass-Through SR Nodes

   Just because a node is SR capable and receives an MPLS-SR-in-UDP
   packet does not mean that it performs SR processing on the packet.
   Only routers identified by SIDs in the SR stack need to do such
   processing.

   Routers that are not addressed by the destination address in the IP
   header simply treat the packet as a normal UDP-in-IP packet carrying
   out normal TTL processing and if the packet is still live routing the
   packet according to the local FIB and applying hashing to resolve any
   ECMP choices.

   This is important because it means that the SR stack can be kept
   relatively small and the packet can be steered through the network
   using shortest path first routing between selected SR nodes.

5.4.  SR Transit Nodes

   When a router receives an MPLS-SR-in-UDP packet that is addressed to
   it, it acts as follows:

   o  Perform TTL processing as normal for an IP packet.

   o  Determine that the packet is addressed to the local node.

   o  Find that the payload is UDP and that the destination port
      indicates MPLS-in-UDP.

   o  Strip the IP and UDP headers.

   o  Pop the top label from the SID stack and retain it for use below.

   o  Encapsulate the packet in UDP with the destination port set to
      6635 and the source port set for entropy.  The entropy value may
      be retained from the received UDP header or may be freshly
      generated.

Internet-Draft            Unified SR using MPLS              August 2017


   o  Encapsulate the packet in IP with the IP source address set to
      this transit router, and the destination address set to the
      address corresponding to the label that was previously popped from
      the stack.

   o  Send the packet into the IP network routing the packet according
      to the local FIB and applying hashing to resolve any ECMP choices.

5.5.  Penultimate SR Transit

   NOTE: This section needs a correction to the PHP behaviour since in
   SR this depends on a flag in the SID advertisement.  This will be
   corrected in a future revision of this text.

   The penultimate SR transit node is only different from the SR transit
   node described in Section 5.4 because it pops the final MPLS-SR SID
   from the stack.  In order to avoid confusion at the egress, the
   router replaces the popped SR label with an explicit null label
   (label value 0 [RFC3032]).  The packet is then encapsulated and sent
   as described in Section 5.4.

5.6.  Domain Egress

   NOTE: This section may also need changing depending on any correction
   to the text in the previous section.  This will also be addressed in
   a future revision of this document.

   The domain egress strips the IP and UDP headers, pops the explicit
   null label, and forwards the payload packet according to its type and
   the local routing/forwarding mechanisms.

6.  Modes of Deployment

   As previously noted, the procedures described in this document may be
   used to connect islands of SR functionality across an IP backbone, or
   can provide SR function within a native IP network.  This section
   briefly expounds upon those two deployment modes.

6.1.  Interconnection of SR Domains

   Figure 3 shows two SR domains interconnected by an IP network.  The
   procedures described in this document are deployed at border routers
   R1 and R2 and packets are carried across the backbone network in a
   UDP tunnel.

   R1 acts as the domain ingress as described in Section 5.1.  It takes
   the MPLS-SR packet from the SR domain, pops the top label and uses it




Bryant, et al.          Expires February 12, 2018              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft            Unified SR using MPLS              August 2017


   to identify its peer border router R2.  R1 then encapsulates the
   packet in UDP in IP and sends it toward R2.

   Routers within the IP network simply forward the packet using normal
   IP routing.

   R2 acts as a domain egress router as described in Section 5.6.  It
   receives a packet that is addressed to it, strips the IP and UDP
   headers, and acts on the payload SR label stack to continue to route
   the packet.

6.2.  SR Within and IP Network

   Figure 4 shows the procedures defined in this document to provide SR
   function across an IP network.

   R1 receives a native packet and classifies it, determining that it
   should be sent on the SR path R2-R3-R4-R5.  It imposes a label stack
   accordingly and then acts as a domain ingress as described in
   Section 5.1.  It pops the label for R2, and encapsulates the packet
   in UDP in IP, sets the IP source to R1 and the IP destination to R2,
   and sends the packet into the IP network.

   Routers Ra and Rb are transit routers that simply forward the packets
   using normal IP forwarding.  They may be legacy transit routers (see
   Section 5.2) or on-path pass-through SR nodes (see Section 5.3).

   R2 is an SR transit nodes as described in Section 5.4.  It receives a
   packet addressed to it, strips the IP and UDP headers, and processes
   the SR label stack.  It pops the top label and uses it to identify

   the next SR hop which is R3.  R2 then encapsulates the packet in UDP
   in IP setting the IP source to R2 and the IP destination to R3.

   Rc, Rd, and Re are transit routers and perform as Ra and Rb.

   R3 is an SR transit node and performs as R2.

   R4 is a penultimate SR transit node as described in Section 5.5.  It
   receives a packet addressed to it, strips the IP and UDP headers, and
   processes the SR label stack.  It pops the top label and uses it to
   identify the next SR hop which is R5.  This was the last label in the
   stack so R4 includes an explicit null label before encapsulating the
   packet in UDP in IP setting the IP source to R4 and the IP
   destination to R5.

   NOTE may also need adjustment to line up with the PHP text.

   R5 is the domain egress as described in Section 5.6.  It receives a
   packet addressed to it, strips the IP and UDP headers, and pops the
   explicit null label before forwarding the payload packet.

7.  Control Plane

   The method of advertising the tunnel encapsulation capability of a
   router using IS-IS or OSPF are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap] and
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap] respectively.  No changes to those
   procedures are needed in support of this work.

8.  OAM

   OAM at the payload layer follows the normal OAM procedures for the
   payload.  To the payload the whole SR network looks like a tunnel.

   OAM in the IP domain follows the normal IP procedures.  This can only
   be carried out between on the IP hops between pairs of SR nodes.

   OAM between instruction processing entities i.e. at the SR layer uses
   the procedures documented for MPLS.

9.  Comparison with SRv6

   The format described in [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]
   (referred to here as SRv6) requires an initial 36 octet IPv6 header:
   no encoding is provided for operation in an IPv4 network.  USR
   requires either an initial 36 octet IPv6 header or an initial 20
   octet IPv4 header.

   o  SRv6 requires an 8 octet SR header, USR requires a UDP header
      which is also 8 octets.

   o  SRv6 requires 16 octets per SID, whereas USR requires only 4
      octets per SID.

   o  The SRv6 SIDs can be a global identifiers, but the USR SIDs cannot
      be.

   o  Both SRv6 SIDs and USR SIDs can be domain unique SIDs.

   o  SRv6 retains the intended path in the packet.  This information
      might be of value for diagnostic purposes although it provides no
      evidence of what path the packet actually took.  If such
      information proves valuable, it could be conveyed in USR using
      metadata.

   As previously noted, the method defined is a complementary way of
   running SR in an IPv6 network that can be used alongside or
   interchangeably with SRv6.  Implementers and deployers should
   consider the benefits and drawbacks of each method and select the
   approach most suited to their needs.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration of [I-D.ietf-spring-ipv6-use-cases] and
   [RFC7510] apply.

   It is difficult for an attacker to pass a raw MPLS encoded packet
   into a network and operators have considerable experience at
   excluding such packets at the network boundaries.

   It is easy for an ingress node to detect any attempt to smuggle IP
   packet into the network since it would see that the UDP destination
   port was set to MPLS.  SR packets not having a destination address
   terminating in the network would be transparently carried and would
   pose no security risk to the network under consideration.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no IANA requests.
