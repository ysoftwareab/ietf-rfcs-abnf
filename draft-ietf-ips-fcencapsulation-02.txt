Internet-Draft            FC Frame Encapsulation            August, 2001


Abstract
 
   This is the ips (IP Storage) working group draft describing the
   common encapsulation format and a procedure for the measurement and
   calculation of frame transit time through the IP network. This
   specification is intended for use by any IETF protocol that
   encapsulates Fibre Channel (FC) frames. This draft describes a frame
   header containing information mandated for encapsulating,
   transmitting, de-encapsulating, and calculating the transit times of
   FC frames.

Internet-Draft            FC Frame Encapsulation            August, 2001


1. Scope
 
   This document describes common mechanisms for the transport of Fibre
   Channel frames over an IP network, including the encapsulation
   format and a mechanism for enforcing the Fibre Channel frame
   lifetime limits.
 
   Use of these mechanisms in a protocol requires an additional
   document to specify the protocol-specific functionality and
   appropriate security considerations. Because security considerations
   for this encapsulation depend on how it is used by protocols, they
   are taken up in protocol-specific documents.
 
2. Encapsulation Concepts
 
   The smallest unit of data transmission and routing in Fibre Channel
   (FC) is the frame. FC frames include a Start Of Frame (SOF), End Of
   Frame (EOF), CRC coverage of the FC Payload for error detection. FC
   frames have several possible lengths. To facilitate transporting FC
   frames over TCP the native FC frame needs to be contained in
   (encapsulated in) a slightly larger structure as shown in figure 1.

       Fig. 1 -  FC frame Encapsulation
 
   The format and content of an FC frame is described in the FC
   standards (e.g., FC-FS [3], FC-SW-2 [4], and FC-PI [5]). Of
   importance to this encapsulation is the FC requirement that all
   frames SHALL contain an CRC for detection of transmission errors.

       Fig. 2 -  FC Encapsulation Header Format
 
   The fields in the FC Encapsulation Header are defined as follows.
 
   Protocol (bits 31-24 in word 0): The Protocol# field SHALL contain a
   number that indicates which protocol is employing the FC
   Encapsulation. The values in the Protocol# field are assigned by
   IANA [6]. The following values are known to be in use:
 
    - FCIP -- TO BE ASSIGNED by IANA
    - iFCP -- TO BE ASSIGNED by IANA
 
   Version (bits 23-16 in word 0): The Version field SHALL contain 0x1
   to indicate that this version of the FC Encapsulation is being used.
   All other values are reserved for future versions of the FC
   Encapsulation.
 
   -Protocol# (bits 15-8 in word 0): The -Protocol# field contains the
   ones complement of the contents of the Protocol# field. FC
   Encapsulation receivers may compare the Protocol# and -Protocol#
   fields as an additional verification that an FC Encapsulation Header
   is being processed.

Internet-Draft            FC Frame Encapsulation            August, 2001


 
   -Version (bits 7-0 in word 0): The -Version field contains the ones
   complement of the contents of the Version field. FC Encapsulation
   receivers may compare the Version and -Version fields as an
   additional verification that an FC Encapsulation Header is being
   processed.
 
   Protocol Specific (words 1 and 2): The usage of these words differs
   based on the contents of the Protocol# field, i.e., the usage of
   this word is defined by the protocol that is employing this
   encapsulation.
 
   Flags (bits 31-26 in word 3): The Flags bits provide information
   about the usage of the FC Encapsulation Header as shown in figure 3.
 
   Note: Implementers are advised to consult the specifications of
   protocols that use this header to determine how each individual
   protocol uses the bits in the Flags field.

       +--------------------------------------------+--------+
 
       Fig. 3 -  Flags Field Format
 
   Reserved (Flags, bits 31-27 in word 3): These bits are reserved for
   use by future versions of the FC Encapsulation and SHALL be set to
   zero on send. Protocols employing this encapsulation MAY require
   checking for zero on receive, however doing so has the potential to
   create incompatibilities with future versions of this encapsulation.
   Changes in the usage of the Reserved Flags bits MUST be identified
   by changes in the contents of the Version field. Protocols employing
   this encapsulation MUST NOT make use of the Reserved Flags bits in
   any fashion other than that described here.
 
   CRCV (CRC Valid Flag, bit 26 in word 3): A CRCV bit value of one
   indicates that the contents of the CRC field are valid. A CRCV bit
   value of zero indicates that CRC are invalid. Some protocols may
   always check the CRC without regard for the state of this bit. The
   value of the CRCV bit SHALL be constant for all FC Encapsulation
   Headers sent on a given TCP connection.
 
   Frame Length (bits 25-16 in word 3): The Frame Length field contains
   the length of the entire FC Encapsulated frame including the FC
   Encapsulation Header and the FC frame (including SOF and EOF words).

Internet-Draft            FC Frame Encapsulation            August, 2001


   This length is based on a unit of 32-bit words. All FC frames are 32-
   bit-word-aligned and the FC Encapsulation Header SHALL always be
   word-aligned; therefore a 32-bit word length is acceptable.
 
   -Flags (bits 15-10 in word 3): The -Flags field contains the ones
   complement of the contents of the Flags field. FC Encapsulation
   receivers may compare the Flags and -Flags fields as an additional
   verification that an FC Encapsulation Header is being processed.
 
   -Frame Length (bits 9-0 in word 3): The -Frame Length field contains
   the ones complement of the contents of the Frame Length field. FC
   Encapsulation receivers may compare the Frame Length and -Frame
   Length fields as an additional verification that an FC Encapsulation
   Header is being processed.
 
   Time Stamp [integer] and Time Stamp [fraction] (words 4 and 5): The
   two Time Stamp contain time at which the FC Encapsulated frame was
   sent as known to the sender. The format of integer and fraction Time
   Stamp word values is specified in Simple Network Time Protocol
   (SNTP) Version 4 [7]. The contents of the Time Stamp [integer] and
   Time Stamp [fraction] words SHALL be set as described in section 4.
 
   CRC (word 6): When the CRCV Flag bit is zero, the CRC field SHALL
   contain zero. When the CRCV Flag bit is one, the CRC field SHALL
   contain a CRC for words 0 to 5 of the FC Encapsulation Header
   computed using the polynomial, initial value, and bit order defined
   for Fibre Channel [3].
 
3.2 FC Encapsulation Header Validation
 
   Two mechanisms are provided for validating an FC Encapsulation
   Header:
 
    - Redundancy based
    -  CRC based
 
   The two mechanisms address the needs of two different design and
   operating environments.
 
3.2.1 Redundancy based FC Encapsulation Header validation
 
   Redundancy based validation of an FC Encapsulation Header relies on
   duplicated and one's complemented fields in the header.
 
   Validation of a header using redundancy may be accomplished using
   very simple logic (e.g., XORs and comparisons). Header validation
   based on redundancy also is a step wise process in that the first
   word is validated, then the second, then the third and so on. A

Internet-Draft            FC Frame Encapsulation            August, 2001


   decision that a candidate header is not valid may be reached before
   the complete header is available.
 
3.2.2 CRC based FC Encapsulation Header validation
 
   CRC based validation of an FC Encapsulation Header relies on a CRC
   located in the last word of the header.
 
   Validation of a header using the CRC may be accomplished using a
   very straight forward algorithm, compute the CRC for all bytes
   preceding the CRC word and compare the results to the CRC word's
   contents. The number of comparisons required to perform CRC
   validation is exactly one and the method for computing the CRC is
   well known with proven implementations.
 
 
4. Measuring Fibre Channel frame transit time
 
   To comply with [3], a FC Fabric must specify and limit the lifetime
   of a frame. In an FC Fabric comprised of TCP-connected elements, one
   component of the frame's lifetime is the time required to traverse
   the TCP connection. To ensure that the total frame lifetime remains
   within the limits required by the FC Fabric, the encapsulation
   described in this specification contains provisions for recording
   the departure time of an encapsulated frame injected into a TCP
   connection. If the encapsulated frame originator and recipient have
   access to aligned and synchronized time bases, the transit time
   through the IP network can then be computed.
 
   When originating an encapsulated frame, an entity that does not
   support transit time calculation SHALL always set the Time Stamp
   [integer] and Time Stamp [fraction] fields to zero. When receiving
   an encapsulated frame, an entity that does not support transit time
   calculation SHALL ignore the contents of the Time Stamp words. The
   protocol SHALL specify whether or not implementation support is
   required.
 
   Encapsulating and de-encapsulating entities that support this
   feature MUST have access to:
 
   a)  An internal time base having the stability and resolution
       necessary to comply with the requirements of the protocol
       specification; and
 
   b)  A time base that is synchronized and aligned with the time base
       of other entities to which encapsulated frames may be sent or
       received. The protocol specification MUST describe the
       synchronization and alignment procedure.


Rajagopal, et al.               Standards Track                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            FC Frame Encapsulation            August, 2001


 
   With respect to its ability to measure and set transit time for
   encapsulated frames exchanged with another device, an entity is
   either in the Synchronized or Unsynchronized state. An entity is in
   the Unsynchronized state upon power-up and transitions to the
   Synchronized state once it has aligned its time base in accordance
   with the applicable protocol specification.
 
   An entity MUST return to the Unsynchronized state if it is unable to
   maintain synchronization of its time base as required by the
   protocol specification.
 
   The policy for processing frames while in the Unsynchronized state
   SHALL be defined by the protocol specification, including whether or
   not the entity may continue to send and receive frames from the IP
   network.
 
   If processing frames in the Unsynchronized state is permitted by the
   protocol specification, the entity SHALL:
 
   a)  When de-encapsulating a frame, ignore the Time Stamp words; and 
 
   b)  When encapsulating a frame set the Time Stamp [integer] and Time
       Stamp [fraction] words to zero.
 
   When encapsulating a frame, an entity in the Synchronized state
   SHALL record the value of the time base in the Time Stamp [integer]
   and Time Stamp [fraction] words in the encapsulation header.
 
   When de-encapsulating a frame, an entity in the Synchronized state
   SHALL:
 
   a)  Test the Time Stamp words to determine if they contain a time as
       specified in [7]. If the time stamp is valid, the receiving
       entity SHALL compute the transit time by calculating the
       difference between its time base and the departure time recorded
       in the frame header. The receiving entity SHALL process the
       calculated transit time and the de-encapsulated frame in
       accordance with the applicable protocol specification; or
 
   b)  If both Time Stamp words have a value of zero, the receiving
       entity SHALL process the de-encapsulated frame without computing
       the transit time. The disposition of the frame and any other
       actions by the recipient SHALL be defined by the protocol
       specification.

5.2 Bit and Byte Ordering
 
   FC frames are mapped to TCP using the big endian byte ordering,
   which corresponds to the standard network byte order or canonical
   form [8].
 
5.3 FC SOF and EOF
 
   The FC frame content is composed of 8-bit bytes that can be
   translated directly for transmission over TCP. The SOF and EOF
   require 8b/10b special characters that cannot be translated directly
   to 8-bit bytes, encoded values are required.
 
   For this reason, the encapsulated FC frame SHALL have the format
   shown in figure 5. The redundancy of the SOF/EOF representation in
   the encapsulation format results from concerns that the information
   be protected from transmission errors.

6. Security
 
   This document describes the encapsulation format only. Actual use of
   this format in a protocol requires an additional document to specify
   the protocol functionality and appropriate security considerations.
   Because security considerations for this encapsulation depend on how
   it is used by protocols, they SHALL be described in protocol-
   specific documents.

ANNEX A - Protocol Requirements
 
   This annex lists the requirements placed on the protocols that
   employ this encapsulation. The requirements listed here are
   suggested or described elsewhere in this document, but their
   collection in this annex serves to assist protocol authors in
   meeting all obligations placed upon them.
 
   Protocol Specific Data
 
   Protocols employing this encapsulation SHALL:
 
    - specify the IANA assigned number used in the Protocol# field
    - specify the contents of the Protocol Specific field
 
   CRC
 
   Protocols employing this encapsulation SHALL either:
 
   1)  Require a valid CRC to be sent and the CRCV Flag bit to be sent
       as one, or
   2)  Require the CRC field to be sent as zero and the CRCV Flag bit
       to be sent as zero.
 
   Protocols employing this encapsulation SHALL define the procedures
   and policies necessary for the detection of over age frames. The
   items to be specified and the choices available to a specification
   are as follows:
 
   a)  The protocol requirements for measuring transit times. The
       protocol MAY allow implementation of transit time measurement to
       be optional.
 
   b)  The requirements or guidelines for stability and resolution of
       the entity's time base.
 
   c)  The procedure for synchronizing an entity's time base, including
       the criteria for entering the Synchronized and Unsynchronized
       states.
 
   d)  The processing of frame traffic while in the Unsynchronized state.
 
       The specification MAY allow an entity in the Unsynchronized
       state to continue processing frame traffic.

   e)  The procedure to be followed when frames are received that do
       not have a valid time stamp.
 
       The specification MAY allow such frames to be accepted by the
       entity.
 
   f)  Requirements for setting and testing the transit time limit and
       the procedure to be followed when a received frame is discarded
       due to its transit time exceeding the limit.
 
 
ANNEX B - IANA Considerations
 
   The Protocol# (Protocol Number, bits 31-24 in word 0 of the
   Encapsulation Header) field is an identifier number used to
   distinguish between the protocols that employ this encapsulation.
   Values used in the Protocol# field are to be assigned from a new,
   separate registry that is maintained by IANA in accordance with RFC
   1700 [6].
 
   All values in the Protocol# field are to be registered with and
   assigned by IANA with the following exceptions.
 
    - Protocol# value 0 should not be assigned until after all other
      values have been assigned.
 
    - Protocol# values 240-255 inclusive must be set aside for private
      use amongst cooperating systems.
 
   Standards action on this RFC should be accompanied by IANA
   assignment of the following two Protocol# values:
 
    - Protocol# value 1 assigned to the FCIP (Fibre Channel Over TCP/
      IP) protocol being developed in draft-ietf-ips-fcovertcpip-__.txt.
 
    - Protocol# value 2 assigned to the iFCP (A Protocol for Internet
      Fibre Channel Storage Networking) protocol being developed in
      draft-ietf-ips-ifcp-__.txt.
 
   Requests for assignments of Protocol# values must be accompanied by
   an RFC which describes how this encapsulation is employed. If the
   RFC is not on the standards-track (i.e., it is an informational or
   experimental RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by
   the IESG before the RFC is published and Protocol# value is
   assigned. It is requested that the ips working group chairs or the
   Transport Services area directors be notified when any new Protocol#
   value assignment is requested.
