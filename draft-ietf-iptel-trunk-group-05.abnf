      trunk-group-unreserved is the intersection of param-unreserved
      defined in [4] and user-unreserved defined in [3].  Since the
      trunk group is an extension to the tel URI and will end up as the
      user portion of a SIP URI, the ABNF for it has to ensure that it
      can be adequately represented in both the constructs.
      descriptor is defined in [4].
