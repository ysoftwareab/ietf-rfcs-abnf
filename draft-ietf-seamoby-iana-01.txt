  Abstract 
      
     Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery protocol and Context Transfer 
     Protocol are experimental protocols designed to accelerate IP handover 
     between wireless access routers. These protocols require IANA allocations 
     for ICMP types, SCTP Payload Protocol Identifiers, port numbers, and 
     registries for certain formatted message options. This document contains 
     instructions to IANA about what allocations are required.

   1.0    Introduction 
      
     The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol [CARD] and 
     Context Transfer Protocol (CTP) [CTP] are experimental protocols designed to 
     accelerate IP handover between wireless access routers. These protocols 
     require IANA allocations for ICMP options and type, SCTP Payload Protocol 
     Identifiers and port number, and establishment of registries for certain 
     formatted message options. Because the protocols are experimental, there is 
     no guarantee that they will ever see widespread deployment in their current 
     form. Consequently, it seems prudent to conserve Internet numbering 
     resources that might be needed for other protocols which could see wider 
     deployment. This draft contains instructions to IANA for the Seamoby 
     protocols. Additionally, some of these allocations are available for other 
     Experimental Mobility protocols. 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
     document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
     Allocation policy names Specification Required, IETF Consensus Action, and 
     Designated Expert are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2434 [RFC2434]. 
      
   2.0    Common IPv4 and IPv6 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign SCTP port number TBD1 for use by Experimental Mobility 
     protocols such as Seamoby. See Section 5.2.1 of [CARD] for a description of 
     inter-access router CARD protocol use of SCTP, and Section 3.1 of [CTP] for 
     a description of the inter-access router CTP use of SCTP. 
      
     IANA SHALL assign SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPI) TBD2, designated 
     "CTP", for the Context Transfer Protocol, and SCTP Payload Protocol 
     Identifier TBD3, designated "CARD", for the Candidate Access Router 
     Discovery protocol. These are used to differentiate inter-router CARD and 
     CTP messages on the SCTP port. The allocation policy for new PPI numbers is 
     the method of IETF Consensus Action. 
      
   3.0    IPv4 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign ICMP type TBD4 for IPv4 identifying ICMP messages utilized 
     by Experimental Mobility protocols such as Seamoby. See Section 5.1.1 of 
     [CARD] for a description of Experimental Mobility CARD ICMP messages 
     specified by Seamoby, and Section 3.2 of [CTP] for the CTP ICMP messages. 
     Furthermore, the IANA SHALL assign the following codes under the 
     Experimental Mobility ICMP type for Seamoby: 
      
           Code                 Purpose                      Reference

     The allocation policy for additional code points under the Experimental 
     Mobility ICMP type is the method of IETF Consensus Action.

   4.0    IPv6 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign ICMP type code TBD8 for IPv6 identifying ICMP messages 
     utilized by Experimental Mobility protocols such as Seamoby. See Section 
     5.1.1 of [CARD] for a description of Experimental Mobility CARD ICMP 
     messages specified by Seamoby, and Section 3.2 of [CTP] for the CTP ICMP 
     messages. Furthermore, the IANA SHALL assign the following codes under the 
     Experimental Mobility ICMP type for Seamoby: 
      
           Code                 Purpose                      Reference

     The allocation policy for additional code points under the Experimental 
     Mobility ICMP type is the method of IETF Consensus Action. 
      
     IANA SHALL assign IPv6 RFC 2461 Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461] option type 
     codes for the following: 
      
              Code            Purpose                   Reference

   5.0    Candidate Access Router Discovery Protocol Registries 
      
     For CARD, two new registries are created that IANA is to maintain, named: 
      
        1) The AVP Type Registry,  
        2) The Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier Registry. 
      
     These are described in the following subsections. 
      
  5.1 AVP Type Registry 
   
     The AVP Type Registry allows future expansion of the CARD AVP type space to 
     include new AVPs. AVP Type codes are 16 bit unsigned integers. See Section 
     5.1.4 of [CARD] for a description of AVPs.

     Internet Draft        Seamoby IANA Allocations                   May, 2004 
      
      
     The registry SHALL be initially populated with the following table: 
      
                 AVP Name                            Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00  
      
     Future allocations of AVP type codes are made through Expert Review, as 
     defined in RFC 2434. 
      
  5.2 Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier Registry 
      
     The Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier registry allows the registration of 
     type codes to uniquely identify specific access technologies in the L2-Type 
     field of the CARD L2 ID sub-option. L2 ID codes are 16 bit unsigned 
     integers. See Section 5.1.3.1 of [CARD] for a description of the CARD L2 ID 
     sub-option. 
      
     The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table: 
      
                 Layer 2 Access Technology            Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00 
                 IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)                   0x01 
                 IEEE 802.11a                            0x02 
                 IEEE 802.11b                            0x03 
                 IEEE 802.11g                            0x04 
                 IEEE 802.15.1(Bluetooth)                0x05 
                 IEEE 802.15.3                           0x06 
                 IEEE 802.15.4                           0x07 
                 IEEE 802.16                             0x08 
      
     Future allocation of Layer 2 Access Technology identifiers are made by the 
     method of Specification Required as defined in RFC 2434. All requests for 
     allocations MUST be accompanied by a reference to a technical document in 
     which the design of the Layer 2 access technology is described.  
      
   6.0    Context Transfer Profile Type Registry 
      
     CTP requires IANA to maintain a registry named the Context Transfer Profile 
     Type Registry, which is a registry of context Feature Profile Type 
     identifiers. Feature Profile Type identifiers are 16 bit unsigned integers 
     that identify particular types of feature contexts. See Section 2.4 of [CTP] 
     for a description of how contexts are carried in CTP. 
      
     The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table: 
      
                 Context Profile                      Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00 
                 IPv6 Multicast Listener Context         0x01 
      
     Future allocations of Feature Profile Type codes are made through Expert 
     Review, as defined in RFC 2434.

   7.0    Utilization by Other Experimental Mobility Protocols 
      
     The ICMP type code and SCTP port are available for other Experimental 
     Mobility protocols to utilize. Other Experimental Mobility protocols MAY 
     define additional ICMP messages that utilize the code points under the 
     Experimental Mobility ICMP type, and MAY define protocols that utilize 
     additional SCTP PPI numbers for the Experimental Mobility protocol port. 
     Such allocations are made through the method of IETF Consensus, as defined 
     in RFC 2434.
