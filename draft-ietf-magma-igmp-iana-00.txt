                                Abstract

This memo requests that the IANA create a registry for fields in the
IGMP protocol header, and provides guidance for the IANA to use in
assigning parameters for those fields.

1.  Introduction

This memo requests that the IANA create a registry for fields in the
IGMP protocol header.

The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
"IETF Consensus", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to refer
to the processes described in [4].

2.  IANA Considerations for fields in the IPv4 IGMP header

The IPv4 IGMP header [1] contains the following fields that carry values
assigned from IANA-managed name spaces: Type and Code. Code field values
are defined relative to a specific Type value.

Values for the IPv4 IGMP Type fields are allocated using an IESG
Approval or Standards Action processes. Code Values for existing IPv4
IGMP Type fields are allocated using IESG Approval or Standards Action
processes. The policy for assigning Code values for new IPv4 IGMP Types
should be defined in the document defining the new Type value.

3.  Assignments for testing and experimentation

Instead of suggesting temporary assignments as in [2], this document
follows the lead of [3] and assigns a range of values for experimental
use.  The IGMP Code values 240-255 inclusive (0xf0 - 0xff) are reserved
for protocol testing and experimentation.

Systems should silently ignore IGMP messages with unknown Code values.

4.  Security Considerations

Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion detection
monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields
described in this memo.  As new values for the fields are assigned,



Fenner                                              Section 4.  [Page 2]

existing security analyzers that do not understand the new values may
fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity if the analyzer declines
to forward the unrecognized traffic, or loss of security if it does
forward the traffic and the new values are used as part of an attack.
This vulnerability argues for high visibility (which the Standards
Action and IETF Consensus processes ensure) for the assignments whenever
possible.

6.  Current IGMP Type/Code Assignments

This section is suitable for use as initial version of the IANA's igmp-
parameters file.  It is to be removed before publication as RFC.

One open issue: is there a place to publish the not-a-standard PIMv1
spec?  It's an I-D that's been expired for 6 years, but is arguably the
only place that the packet formats for PIMv1 are defined.  Can this spec
be placed in a stable place at the RFC-editor site without giving it any
kind of official status?

IGMP TYPE NUMBERS

The Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP) has many messages that
are identified by a "type" field.

Note that the original definition of IGMP in RFC1112 divided this
field into two 4-byte values, "version" and "type".  This was
decided to be too restrictive, so the fields were combined into a
single 8-bit type space.

Type      Name                                    Reference
----      ----------------------                  ---------

0x13      DVMRP                                   [...]
0x14      PIM version 1                           [PIMv1]

0x22      IGMPv3 Membership Report                [...]
0xf0-0xff Reserved for experimentation            [...]


Many of these IGMP types have a "code" field.  Here we list the types
again with their assigned code fields.
