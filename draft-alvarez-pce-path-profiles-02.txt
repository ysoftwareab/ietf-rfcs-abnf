                           PCE Path Profiles
                   draft-alvarez-pce-path-profiles-02

Abstract

   This document describes extensions to the Path Computation Element
   (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) to signal path profile
   identifiers.  A profile represents a list of path parameters or
   policies that a PCEP peer may invoke on a remote peer using an opaque
   identifier.  When a path computation client (PCC) initiates a path
   computation request, the PCC can signal profile identifiers to invoke
   path parameters or policies defined on the PCE which would influence
   the path computation.  Similarly, when a PCE initiates or updates a
   path, the PCE can signal profile identifiers to invoke path
   parameters or policies defined on the PCC which would influence the
   path setup.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

Internet-Draft              PCE Path Profiles                 March 2014


2.  Path Profiles

   A path profile represents a list of path parameters or policies that
   a PCEP peer may invoke on a remote peer using a profile identifier.
   The receiving peer interprets the identifier according to a local
   path profile definition.  The PATH-PROFILE object defined in
   Section 4.2 can signal one or more profile identifiers.  PCEP carries
   profile identifiers as opaque values.  PCEP peers do not exchange the
   details of a path profile.  The PCE may be stateful or stateless.

3.  Procedures

3.1.  Capability Advertisement

   PCEP peers advertise their capability to support path profile
   identifiers during the session initialization phase.  They include
   the PATH-PROFILE-CAPABILITY TLV defined in Section 4.1 as part of the
   OPEN object.  A PCEP peer can only signal path profile identifiers if
   both peers advertised this capability.  A peer MUST send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type=4 (Not supported object), Error-value=1 (Not
   supported object class) and close the session if it receives a
   message with a path profile identifier, it supports the extensions in
   this document and both peers did not advertise this capability.

3.2.  PCC-Initiated Paths

   A PCC MAY include a PATH-PROFILE object when sending a PCReq message.
   The PCE uses the path profile identifiers to select path parameters
   or path policies to fulfill the request.  The PCE MUST process the
   identifiers in the PATH-PROFILE object in the order received.  The
   means by which the PCC learns about a particular path profile
   identifier and decides to include it in a PCReq message are outside
   the scope of this document.  Similarly, the means by which the PCE
   selects a set of parameters or policies based on the profile
   identifier for a specific request are outside the scope of this
   document.  The P flag of the PATH-PROFILE object MUST be set.

   A PCE may receive a path computation request with one or more
   unexpected path profile identifiers.  The PCE sends a PCErr message
   with Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error), Error-value=1 (Unknown
   path profile) if the path profile identifier is not known to the PCE.
   The PCE sends a PCErr message with Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE
   Error), Error-value=2 (Invalid path profile) if the PCE knows about
   the path profile identifier, but considers the request invalid.  As
   an example, the profile may be invalid because of the path type, the
   PCEP session type or the originating PCC.  The PCE sends a PCErr
   message with Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error), Error-value=3
   (Incompatible path profiles) if two or more path profile identifiers

   are incompatible.  That is, they are known and valid, but can not
   occur simultanously.  The PCEP-ERROR object SHOULD include the path
   profile identifiers that generated the error condition.

   The PCE will determine whether to consider any additional optional
   objects included in a PCReq message based on policy.  As illustrated
   in Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.2, the PCC MAY include other
   optional objects along with a PATH-PROFILE object as part of a path
   computation request.  The PCC will use the processing-rule (P) flag
   in the common object header to signal whether it considers those
   objects mandatory or optional when the PCE performs path computation.
   Those objects may overlap with the path parameters that the PCE
   associates with the path profile identifier.

   PCE policy may place different kinds of restrictions on PCReq
   messages that include a PATH-PROFILE object and additional
   parameters.  A PCE MUST send an error message if it receives a
   request with optional objects signaled as mandatory (P flag = 1) for
   path computation and PCE policy does not allow such behavior from the
   originating PCC.  In that case, the PCE sends a PCErr message with
   Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error), Error-value=3 (Unexpected
   mandatory object).  If the objects are signaled as optional (P flag =
   0) for path computation, the PCE will decide based on policy whether
   to consider them or not.  When sending the PCRep message for the
   request, the PCE will use the ignore (I) flag in the common object
   header to indicate to the PCC whether an object was ignored.

3.2.1.  Point-to-Point Paths

   [RFC5440] defines the basic structure of a PCReq message for point-
   to-point paths.  This documents extends the message format as
   follows:

   <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>
                      [<svec-list>]
                      <request-list>


   where:

      <svec-list>::=<SVEC>[<svec-list>]
      <request-list>::=<request>[<request-list>]

      <request>::= <RP>
                   <END-POINTS>
                   [<PATH-PROFILE>]
                   [<path-computation>]

   where:

   <path-computation> is the list of optional objects used for path
   computation as defined initially in [RFC5440] and modified in
   subsequent PCEP extensions.

   If present in a PCReq message, the PATH-PROFILE object MUST be the
   first optional object in the request portion of the message.

3.2.2.  Point-to-Multipoint Paths

   [RFC6006] defines the basic structure of a PCReq message for point-
   to-multipoint paths.  This documents extends the message format as
   follows:

   <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>
                      <request>


   where:

      <request>::= <RP>
                   <end-point-rro-pair-list>
                   [<PATH-PROFILE>]
                   [<OF>]
                   [<LSPA>]
                   [<BANDWIDTH>]
                   [<metric-list>]
                   [<IRO>]
                   [<LOAD-BALANCING>]


   where:

      <end-point-rro-pair-list>::=
                         <END-POINTS>[<RRO-List>][<BANDWIDTH>]
                         [<end-point-rro-pair-list>]

      <RRO-List>::=<RRO>[<BANDWIDTH>][<RRO-List>]
      <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>]


   If present in a PCReq message, the PATH-PROFILE object MUST be the
   first optional object in the request portion of the message.

3.3.  PCE-Initiated Paths

   A PCE MAY include a PATH-PROFILE object when sending a PCInitiate
   message as defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].  The PCC uses
   the path profile identifiers to select path parameters or path
   policies to be applied during the instantiation of the path.  The PCC
   MUST process the identifiers in the PATH-PROFILE object in the order
   received.  The means by which the PCE learns about a particular path
   profile identifier and decides to include it in a PCInitiate message
   are outside the scope of this document.  Similarly, the means by
   which the PCC selects a set of parameters or policies based on the
   profile identifier for a specific path are outside the scope of this
   document.

   A PCC may receive a path instantiation request with one or more
   unexpected path profile identifiers.  The PCC sends a PCErr message
   with Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error), Error-value=1 (Unknown
   path profiles) if the path profile identifier is not known to the
   PCC.  The PCC sends a PCErr message with Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-
   PROFILE Error), Error-value=2 (Invalid path profiles) if the PCC
   knows about the path profile identifier, but considers the request
   invalid.  As an example, the profile may be invalid because of the
   path type, the PCEP session type or the originating PCE.  The PCC
   sends a PCErr message with Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error),
   Error-value=3 (Incompatible path profiles) if two or more path
   profile identifiers are incompatible.  That is, they are known and
   valid, but can not occur simultanously.  The PCEP-ERROR object SHOULD
   include the path profile identifiers that generated the error
   condition.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] defines the basic structure of a
   PCInitiate message.  This documents extends the message format as
   follows:
