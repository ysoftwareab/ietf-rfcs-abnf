   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this 
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the 
   original TIFF specification [TIFF] to obtain complete feature and 
   technical details. 
    
    
5.1  TIFF Scope 
    
    
   TIFF describes image data that typically comes from scanners, frame 
   grabbers, and paint- and photo-retouching programs. TIFF is not a 
   printer language or page description language. The purpose of TIFF 
   is to describe and store raster image data.  A primary goal of TIFF 
   is to provide a rich environment within which applications can 
   exchange image data. This richness is required to take advantage of 
   the varying capabilities of scanners and other imaging devices.  
   Though TIFF is a rich format, it can easily be used for simple 
   scanners and applications as well because the number of required 
   fields is small.

5.2  TIFF Features 
    
    
   Some of the features of TIFF (from [TIFF]) are: 
    
    - TIFF is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color,  
      and full-color image data in several color spaces. 
    
    - TIFF includes a number of compression schemes that allow  
      developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their   
      applications. 
    
    - TIFF is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as new  
      needs arise. 
    
    - TIFF allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or  
      special-purpose information. 
    
 
6.  MIME Definition 
 
 
6.1  image/tiff 
    
    
   The image/tiff content-type was previously defined in RFC1528 as 
   containing TIFF 6.0 encoded image data, with specific reference made 
   to a subset known as TIFF Class F. This document redefines the 
   original image/tiff definition to refer to TIFF 6.0 [TIFF] encoded 
   image data, consistent with existing practice for TIFF aware Internet 
   applications. This definition is further enhanced by introducing the 
   new "application parameter" (section 6.2) to enable identification of 
   a specific subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions for the encoded image 
   data. 
    
 
6.2  Application parameter 
    
    
   There are cases where it may be useful to identify the application 
   applicable to the content of an image/tiff body. Typically, this 
   would be used to assist the recipient in dispatching a suitable 
   rendering package to handle the display or processing of the image 
   file. As a result, an optional "application" parameter is defined for 
   image/tiff to identify a particular application's subset of TIFF and 
   TIFF extensions for the encoded image data, if it is known. No values 
   are defined in this document.  
    
    
   Example: 
    
                Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo 
    
   There is no default value for application, as the absence of the 
   application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image is

   Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the 
   application. It is up to the recipient's implementation to determine 
   the application (if necessary) and render the image to the user.  
 
 
7.  IANA Registration 
    
    
        To: ietf-types@iana.org 
        Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/tiff 
    
        MIME media type name: image 
    
        MIME subtype name: tiff 
    
        Required parameters: none 
    
        Optional parameters: application 
    
           There is no format specified for the value of this parameter 
           in addition to that specified by [MIME1].  Various 
           applications of TIFF may define values as required.  There is 
           no default value for application, as the absence of the 
           application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image 
           is Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the 
           application.  It is up to the implementation to determine the 
           application (if necessary) and render the image to the user. 
    
        Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred 
    
        Security considerations:  
    
           TIFF utilizes a structure which can store image data and 
           attributes of this image data. The fields defined in the TIFF 
           specification are of a descriptive nature and provide 
           information that is useful to facilitate viewing and 
           rendering of images by a recipient.  As such, the fields 
           currently defined in the TIFF specification do not in 
           themselves create additional security risks, since the fields 
           are not used to induce any particular behavior by the 
           recipient application. 
            
           TIFF has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically 
           possible that fields could be defined in the future which 
           could be used to induce particular actions on the part of the 
           recipient, thus presenting additional security risks, but 
           this type of capability is not supported in the referenced 
           TIFF specification. Indeed, the definition of fields which 
           would include such processing instructions is inconsistent 
           with the goals and spirit of the TIFF specification. 
        Interoperability considerations:  
    
           The ability of implementations to handle all the defined 
           applications (or profiles within applications) of TIFF may 
           not be ubiquitous. As a result, implementations may decode

           and attempt to display the encoded TIFF image data only to 
           determine that the image cannot be rendered. The presence of 
           the application parameter may aid in allowing this 
           determination before dispatching for rendering.  However, it 
           should be noted that the parameter value is not intended to 
           convey levels of capabilities for a particular application.
