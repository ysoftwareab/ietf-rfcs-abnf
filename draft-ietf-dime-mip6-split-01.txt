Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH support       October 2006


1.  Introduction

   With the Mobile IPv6 protocol [1], a Mobile Node (MN) is assigned a
   Home Agent which is in charge of relaying IPv6 packets destined to
   MN's Home Address to the MN's current address.  Moreover, the Mobile
   Node and its Home Agent (HA) must share IPsec Security Associations
   to protect Mobile IPv6 signalling.  Note that it is possible to use
   another method than IPsec to secure signalling messages, but in this
   document, only IPsec is considered.  One of the problem is to
   dynamically set-up these Security Associations and to assign the Home
   Agent Address and the Home Address to the Mobile Node.  This problem
   is known as the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem and is detailed in
   [2].  Two possible bootstrapping scenarios have been identified,
   namely the Integrated and the Split Scenario.  With the Integrated
   Scenario (see [3]), the Home Agent Address is delivered during the
   process of network access authentication, while in the Split scenario
   (see [4]), the Home Agent information is discovered using the DNS
   infrastructure.  In both cases, the Mobile Node has the Home Agent
   information and it interacts with the Home Agent using IKEv2 [5].

   From an operator perspective, it is important to verify that the user
   (MN) is authorized to utilize Mobile IPv6 service and that such
   services are accounted for.  The Home Agent, while verifying the
   user's identity, also participates in the Mobile IPv6 authorization
   process and due to its role in traffic forwarding performs accounting
   for this service.  For this reason, it is important for the Home
   Agent to act as part of the service provider's AAA infrastructure.

   The goal of this document is to specify a new Diameter application,
   called Diameter Mobile IPv6 Authorization Application specifying the
   authorization and accounting procedures associated for Mobile IPv6
   service.  Furthermore, the document specifies the role of Home Agent
   as a Diameter client to support this application.  This modular
   approach provides flexibility for the choice of authentication in
   conjunction with Mobile IPv6 services.  For instance, the HA can use
   the Diameter EAP Application [6] or other procedures for performing
   authentications through a Diameter server.  Note that this
   application can be used both in Integrated and Split scenarios.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [7].

   The MIPv6 bootstrapping terminology is taken from [2].

3.  Diameter MIP6 HA-to-AAAH Overview

   The Home Agent offers the Mobile IPv6 service to the Mobile Node.  As
   a Diameter client, the delivered Home Agent performs the following
   operations:

   Authentication:  The Home Agent must verify the identity of the user
      provided in the IKEv2 exchange.

   Authorization:  The Home Agent must verify that the user is
      authorized to use the Mobile IPv6 service.

   Accounting:  For billing purposes and capacity planning, the Home
      Agent provides accounting report to the AAA infrastructure.


   Figure 1 shows the architecture of the solution described in this
   document.

                      Figure 1: Architecture Overview

   For the authentication part, it is likely that operators will use EAP
   within IKEv2 to authenticate the user since it is the easiest way for
   operator to leverage their AAA infrastructure for IKEv2 initiator
   authentication.  The Diameter EAP Application [6] is the application
   that permits carrying EAP packets between an access device and a AAA
   server.  However, this application is primarly defined to perform AAA
   operations for network access service and not for Mobile IPv6
   service.  For this reason, it is recommended that, when EAP is used
   for authentication, the Diameter EAP application will be used only
   for Authentication purpose.  This implies that the Home Agent will
   use the Diameter EAP Application in "AUTHENTICATE_ONLY" mode.  This
   is realized by setting the Auth-Request-Type AVP to
   AUTHENTICATE_ONLY.  In this document, the AAA server contacted for
   Authentication is called AAAH-EAP.  This server belongs to the MSA.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH support       October 2006


   To explicitely authorize the Mobile IPv6 service, in this document,
   we define a new Diameter application, called Mobile IPv6
   Authorization Application.  The application requires two new
   messages, namely: MIP6-Authorization-Request (MAR) and MIP6-
   Authorization-Answer (MAA).  The HA, acting as a Diameter client for
   this new application, sends a MIP6-Authorization-Request message
   containing identity of the user to the Mobility service authorizer
   (e.g., HAAA for MIP6 service) to verify that this user is authorized
   to use Mobile IPv6 service.  This message is sent towards Diameter
   server called AAAH-MIP6 in this document.  This server belongs to the
   MSA.

   This message may also contain some specific authorization AVPs
   concerning Home-Address Allocation and Home-Address DNS registration.
   The response is contained in the MIP6-Authorization-Answer.  As this
   application needs a new Application-Id [[[To Be assigned by IANA]]],
   it has to be noted that the Mobile IPv6 authorization requests may be
   routed to a different AAA server (AAAH-MIP6) than the AAA server used
   for Authentication request (AAAH-EAP).

   When the verification of user authorization to receive Mobile IPv6
   service is complete, the Home-Agent start performing Accounting
   operation by sending accounting message (ACR) with the AVP Acct-
   Application-ID set to [[[To Be Assigned by IANA]]].  These messages
   contain specific Mobile IPv6 AVPs and are sent to the AAAH-MIP6.


4.  Diameter Mobile IPv6 HA-to-AAAH Support

   Although the main goal of this document is to specify the
   authorization and accounting for Mobile IPv6 application, the intent
   is also to provide guidance on the AAA operations expected from HA.
   Hence, this document provides guidance on the procedures required
   from the HA as part of the authentication process.  As EAP is
   considered as a strong choice in performing authentication, this
   document explains the use of Diameter EAP application in cases where
   the prior authentication between MN and HA is done through use of
   EAP.  Therefore, the HA performs AAA operations for Mobile IPv6 by
   using two Diameter Applications, namely: Diameter EAP[6] and Diameter
   Mobile IPv6 (specified by this document).

   If EAP is used within IKEv2, the HA uses the procedures of Diameter
   EAP application (DER/DEA) with the Auth-Request-Type set to
   AUTHENTICATE_ONLY.

4.1.  Authentication

   As mentioned before, prior to performing authorization process, the
   HA must authenticate the user.  The use of IKEv2 between the MN and
   the HA allows the HA to authenticate the Mobile Node.  Traditional
   IKE authentication procedures require existence of pre-shared secrets
   or certificates between MN and HA.  However, given the possible lack
   of prior knowledge between MN and HA, the more desired approach is to
   use EAP and the AAA infrastructure to authenticate the user during
   IKEv2.

4.1.1.  HA with EAP Support

   Figure 2 shows the message flow involved during the authentication
   phase when EAP is used.

                 Figure 2: IKEv2 Diameter EAP Message Flow

   The MN and the HA start the interaction with an IKE_SA_INIT exchange.
   In this phase cryptographic algorithms are negotiated, nonces and a
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are exchanged.  Message (3) starts the
   IKE_AUTH phase.  This second phase authenticates the previous
   messages, exchanges identities and certificates and establishes the
   first CHILD_SA.  It is used to mutually authenticate the Mobile Node

   (acting as an IKEv2 Initiator) and the Home Agent (acting as an IKEv2
   Responder).  The identity of the User/Mobile Node is provided in the
   field IDi.  The Mobile Node indicates its willingness to be
   authenticated by EAP by omitting the field AUTH in message 3 (cf.
   [5]).  The Mobile Node authenticates the Home Agent by requesting a
   certificate.  This is done by including the field [CERTREQ] in
   message 3.

   As part of the authentication process, the Mobile Node MAY request a
   Home-Address, a Home Prefix or suggests one [4].  This is done by
   using a CFG_REQUEST payload in the message 3.

   The Home Agent extracts the IDi field from the message 3 and sends a
   Diameter-EAP-Request message towards the authenticating Diameter
   server AAAH-EAP.  The User-Name AVP of the DER message MUST be set to
   the IDi field and the Auth-Request-Type MUST be set to
   AUTHENTICATE_ONLY.  This message is routed through the AAA
   infrastructure to the home AAA server (AAAH-EAP) of this Mobile Node.
   The AAAH-EAP chooses an authentication method and replies with the
   DEA Message.

   At the end of the EAP authentication phase, the AAAH-EAP indicates
   the result of the authentication in the Result-Code AVP and provides
   the corresponding EAP packet (EAP Success or EAP Failure).  The last
   IKEv2 message sent by the Home Agent contains the Home Address or the
   Home Prefix.  In the latter case, a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange is
   necessary to setup IPsec SAs for Mobile IPv6 signalling.

4.1.2.  HA without EAP Support

   To be completed.

4.2.  Authorization

   Following the successful authentication, the Home Agent must ensure
   that the Mobile Node is authorized to use the Mobile IPv6 service.
   For this purpose, the Home Agent sends a MIP6-Authorization-Request
   (MAR) message containing identity of the user towards the AAAH-MIP6.
   The Application-ID of this message is set to [TO BE ASSIGNED].  The
   identity is extracted from the IDi field provided in the message 3 of
   the IKEv2 exchange.  The home AAA server (AAAH-MIP6) replies with a
   MIP6-Authorization-Answer which contains the result of the
   authorization process.  This latter message MAY contain configuration
   policies to be applied at the Home Agent.

   As part of the authorization request for the Mobile IPv6 service.
   The Home Agent may require specific authorization for this MN.  As an
   example, it may request if this user is allowed to auto-assign its

   Home-Address.

4.3.  Accounting

   Concerning accounting, the Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application [8]
   defines the following AVPs:

   o  Accounting-Input-Octets: Number of octets in IP packets received
      from the user
   o  Accounting-Output-Octets: Number of octets in IP packets sent by
      the user
   o  Accounting-Input-Packets: Number of IP packets received from the
      user
   o  Accounting-Output-Packets: Number of IP packets sent by the user.

   These AVPs may be re-used for the Mobile IPv6 service.  However, due
   to routing optimization techniques introduced with Mobile IPv6 the HA
   does not see the entire traffic exchanged between the MN and the CN.

   [Editor's Note: As the document describing goals for this interface
   is not finalized, other parameters may be needed in the future.]

4.4.  Mobile IPv6 Session Management

   Concerning Mobile IPv6 session, the AAAH (AAAH-MIP6) server may
   maintain state or may be stateless.  This is indicated in the Auth-
   Session-State AVP (or its abscence) in the MAA message.  The Home
   Agent MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine defined in
   [9].  Moreover the following 4 commands may be exchanged between the
   Home Agent and the home AAA server.

4.4.1.  Session-Termination-Request Command

   The Session-Termination-Request (STR) message [9] is sent by the Home
   Agent to inform the Diameter server that an authorized session is
   being terminated.

4.4.2.  Session-Termination-Answer Command

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [9] is sent by the
   Diameter server to acknowledge the notification that the session has
   been terminated.

4.4.3.  Abort-Session-Request Command

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [9] is sent by the Diameter
   server to terminates the session.  This fulfills one of the
   requirement described in [11].

4.4.4.  Abort-Session-Answer Command

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [9] is sent by the Home Agent
   in response to an ASR message.


5.  Command-Code Values

   This section defines Command-Code [9] value that MUST be supported by
   all Diameter implementations conforming to this specification.  The
   following Command Codes are defined in this specification:

10.  Open Issues

10.1.  Authentication Token

   Authentication and Authorization/Accounting process may be handled by
   two different AAA servers, namely AAAH-EAP and AAAH-MIP6.  As such,
   the AAAH-MIP6 does not know if the MN has been correctly
   authenticated before authorizing the service.

   The issue is to know wether we need to provide a proof to the AAAH-
   MIP6 that the MN is correctly authenticated by AAAH-EAP

10.2.  HA as a Single Physical Device

   The HA acts as a IKEv2 responder with the MN.  As such, it can be
   colocated with a VPN concentrator.

   The issue is how the HA know that the MN want MIP6 service.

10.3.  Triggering the MIP6 Authorization Application

   If EAP is used to authenticate the MN, the HA uses two applications
   to perform AAA operations: Diameter EAP and the MIP6 Authorization
   Application.

   The issue is to know when the MIP6 Authorization Application must be
   used by the HA.

   This issue is tied with the "HA as a single box" one.  If the only
   way for the HA to know that it was for mip6 is to wait for a BU from
   the MN, then the Application can be used only after the reception of
   the BU.  However, if we want to do HoA-Allocation authorization by
   the AAAH-MIP6, this implies that the application must be used before
   the end of the IKEv2 exchange and thus before the BU reception

10.4.  RFC4285 Support

   This document deals with the HA-to-AAAH support in case IKEv2 is used
   to setup IPsec SAs between MN and HA to secure Mobile IPv6
   signalling.

   The issue is wether support for RFC 4285 mechanism should also be
   handled by this document.
