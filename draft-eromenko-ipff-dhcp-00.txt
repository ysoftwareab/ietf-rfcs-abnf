Introduction

   DHCP in IPv4 works remarkably well, and so a good idea is to keep it 
   almost unchanged in IP-FF. Instead of publishing a full RFC, I focus
   only on changes required from DHCPv4.

2. Changes from DHCPv4, as defined in RFC-2131

   FIELD       BITS       DESCRIPTION
   -----      ------      -----------

   
   ciaddr           Client IP address; only filled in if client is in
                    BOUND, RENEW or REBINDING state and can respond
                    to ARP requests.

   'ciaddr', which was present in DHCPv4, is no longer here, and is 
   replaced by "Source IP address" of an incoming DHCP request.
   It should be retrieved from the IP packet.

   Version       4  Versioning was added to simplify future evolution.
                      = 1

   Hops          4  Hops field shrikned from 8 bits to 4 bits.

   servername  128  Bytes. It was extended from 64 bytes, mainly for 
                    Unicode compatibility reasons.
                    A single Unicode character can take 2-3 bytes.

   'Seconds' and 'flags' fields were shrinked from 16-bits to 14-bits.

   All address fields were extended to 50-bits; forced change.



3. Booting IP-FF via DHCP

   Booting IP-FF stack is covered in Link Address Resolution Algorithm
   "LARA" specification.

   In general case, with DHCP it should be similar to IPv4.
   That is using an unspecified IP-FF address as source (0.0.0.0.0) and
   a physical MAC address (on Ethernet) or other Data-Link Layer 
   address.

   The destination multicast address for DHCP servers is   99.9.0.1.1
   The destination multicast address for DHCP clients is   99.9.0.0.1



4. Throttling / Delayed replies on High usage

   If a DHCP server is also the default gateway, it MAY
   artificially *delay* giving IP-FF addresses, if CPU or network
   usage is high, allowing for another DHCP server to answer DHCP,
   and allowing them becoming default gateways, providing a per-node
   load-balancing (as opposed to per-session or per-packet 
   load-balancing).

   Reasonable value is 10 ms delay per 1% CPU or (WAN/external) network
   bandwidth usage, with delays starting only after 25% usage.

   This feature SHOULD be implemented in "Corporate" DHCP servers,
   but not required for "Home" segment products.
