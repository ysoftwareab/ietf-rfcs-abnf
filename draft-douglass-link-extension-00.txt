Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar             June 2010


1.  Introduction

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks a general
   purpose method for referencing additional, external information
   relating to calendar components.

   This document proposes a method for referencing typed external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component (such as a VCARD).  This method is general
   purpose and may be used anywhere the need to reference additional
   information is desired.

   This new LINK property is closely aligned to the LINK header defined
   in [TODO draft-nottingham-http-link-header]

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Typed References

   The LINK property defines a typed reference or relation to external
   meta-data or related resources.  By providing type and format
   information as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover
   interesting references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or
   the presentation of interesting links for the user.

   Many of these relations are designed to handle common use cases in
   event publication.  It is generally important to provide information
   about the organizers of such events.  Sponsors also wish to be
   referenced in a prominent manner.  In social calendaring it is often
   important to identify the active participants in the event, for
   example a school sports team, and the inactive participants, for
   example the parents.

   This property will also allow references to other data that has a
   time components.  For example, in the power industry it allows the
   creation of schedules of power usage linked to related information
   about the amount and cost.

   For example the [RFC5545] LOCATION property provides only an
   unstructured text value for specifying the location where an event
   (or "TODO" item) will occur.  This is inadequate for use cases where
   structured location information (e.g. address, region, country,

   postal code) is required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption
   of iCalendar in those settings.

   Using LINK, structured information about the venue such as address,
   city, region/state and postal code can be communicated, perhaps using
   a VCARD object.  Servers and clients can retrieve the vcard object
   when storing the event and use it to index by geographic location.

   As another example, a calendar item can reference a video feed for
   the event.  This provides event publishers with a means to attract
   consumers to their sites while providing a service directly
   accessible from the users' calendar client.


3.  New Property Parameters

3.1.  Rel

   Parameter name:  REL

   Purpose:  To specify the relationship of data referenced by a LINK
      property.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

  relparam      = "REL" "="
                  ("CAL_CONTACT"      ; A contact address
                   "CAL_LOCATION"
                        ; A location reference (a.k.a. "Venue")
                   "CAL_ORGANIZEDBY"
                        ; An event organizer - NOT a meeting scheduler
                   "CAL_PERFORMER"    ; Performer at an event
                   "CAL_PRINCIPAL_PERFORMER"
                         ; A principal performer at an event
                   "CAL_PRINCIPAL_SPONSOR"   ; A principal sponsor
                   "CAL_SPONSOR"      ; Sponsor for an event
                   "CAL_PR_CONTACT"   ; Public relations contact

                   "CAL_ACTIVE_PARTICIPANT"  ; e.g. a team,
                   "CAL_INACTIVE_PARTICIPANT"  ; e.g. parents of a team,

                   "CAL_VIRTUAL_LOCATION"    ; A Virtual location
                                         ; (a.k.a. "Chatroom")
                   "CAL_TELECONFERENCE_DIALIN"

                   "CAL_TICKETING_OFFICE"  ; Make reservations
                                           ; and/or pay

                   ; Media feeds
                   "CAL_AUDIO_MEDIA"    ; An audio feed
                   "CAL_SOCIAL_MEDIA"   ; Feed other than Audio/Video
                   "CAL_VIRTUAL_MEDIA"  ; A Virtual World Space

                  / x-name        ; Experimental reference type
                  / iana-token)    ; Other IANA registered type

   Description:  This parameter MUST be specified on all LINK
      properties, and defines the type of reference.  This allows
      programs consuming this data to automatically scan for references
      they support.  For example, a mobile device may be able to consume
      LOCATION references, but not other types of reference.

   Registration:  These relation types are registered in [TODO ref to
      draft-nottingham-http-link-header].

3.1.1.  Relation Type CAL_CONTACT

   This type identifies a contact for the event.  An appropriate format
   for this reference would be text/vcard allowing clients to display
   rich contact information.

Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar             June 2010


3.1.2.  Relation Type CAL_LOCATION

   This type identifies the location of the event.  An appropriate
   format for this reference would be text/vcard allowing clients to
   display rich location information and possibly link to mapping
   applications.

   Event consumers can use this reference to index the event by the
   geographic location allowing proximity searching.

3.1.3.  Relation Type CAL_ORGANIZEDBY

   This type identifies an organizer for the event.  An appropriate
   format for this reference would be text/vcard allowing clients to
   display rich information.

   This type is distinct from the ORGANIZER property which is only
   allowed on scheduling messages.  This property allows event
   organizers to identify themselves.

3.1.4.  Relation Type CAL_PERFORMER

   This type identifies a performer for the event.  An appropriate
   format for this reference would be text/vcard allowing clients to
   display rich information about the performer.

   This reference allows event consumers to index events by the
   performer and may appear once for each performer.

3.1.5.  Relation Type CAL_PRINCIPAL_PERFORMER

   This type identifies a principal performer for the event.  An
   appropriate format for this reference would be text/vcard allowing
   clients to display rich information about the performer.

   This reference allows event consumers to index events by the
   principal performer.

3.1.6.  Relation Type CAL_ACTIVE_PARTICIPANT

   This type identifies an active participant in an event.  The form for
   this reference could be text/vcard identifying a group such as a team
   or an individual.

3.1.7.  Relation Type CAL_INACTIVE_PARTICIPANT

   This type identifies inactive participants for an event.  These are
   usually interested parties that may act as spectators, for example,

   the parents of team members.  The form for this reference could be
   text/vcard identifying a group such as a team or an individual.

   This reference allows event organizers to notify the participants in
   the event of changes.

3.1.8.  Relation Type CAL_SPONSOR

   This type identifies a sponsor for the event.  An appropriate format
   for this reference would be text/vcard allowing clients to display
   rich information about sponsors or perhaps to insert sponsor logos
   where appropriate.

   It is assumed that there may be multiple references of this type,
   each identifying a different sponsor.

3.1.9.  Relation Type CAL_PRINCIPAL_SPONSOR

   This type identifies a principal sponsor for the event.  An
   appropriate format for this reference would be text/vcard allowing
   clients to display rich information about sponsors or perhaps to
   insert sponsor logos where appropriate.

   It is assumed that there may be multiple references of this type,
   each identifying a different sponsor.

3.1.10.  Relation Type CAL_AUDIO_MEDIA

   This type identifies an audio feed associated with the event.

3.1.11.  Relation Type CAL_VIDEO_MEDIA

   This type identifies a video feed associated with the event.

3.2.  Title

   Parameter name:  TITLE

   Purpose:  To provide a human readable title.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     titleparam     = "TITLE" "=" text

Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar             June 2010


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on all LINK properties,
      and provides a human readable label, perhaps for icons or links..


4.  New Properties

4.1.  Link

   Property name:  LINK

   Purpose:  This property provides a reference to external information
      about a component.

   Value type:  URI

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, reference type or format type
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      points to additional information related to the component.  For
      example, it may reference a VCARD giving detailed information
      about the venue of a VEVENT.

   Format Definition:

      This property is defined by the following notation:

     link            = "LINK" linkparam ":" uri CRLF

     linkparam       = *(

                     ; the following are MANDATORY
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (";" relparam) /
                     (";" fmttypeparam) /
                     (";" titleparam) /

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" xparam)

                     )

Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar             June 2010


   Example:

      The following is an example of this property.  It points to a
      VCARD version describing the location of a VEVENT.

                   LINK;REL=LOCATION;TYPE=text/vcard;
                     TITLE=The Egg:
                     http://eventful.com/vcard/venues/V0-001-000361522-8


5.  Security Considerations

   Applications using the LINK property need to be aware of the risks
   entailed in using the URIs provided as values.  See [RFC3986] for a
   discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs.
