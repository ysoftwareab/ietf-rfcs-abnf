Abstract

   This document specifies a new parameter for the tel URI that
   represents the Calling Party's Category, a parameter used in SS7 ISUP
   signaling.

1.  Introduction

   SS7 ISUP [3] defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) parameter that
   characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other
   important state that can describe the originating party.  When

Internet-Draft                 CPC tel URI                      Aug 2006


   telephone numbers are contained in URIs, such as the tel URI [1], it
   may be desirable to communicate any CPC associated with that
   telephone number or, in the context of a call, the party calling from
   it.

   Note that in some networks (including North America), the Originating
   Line Information (OLI) parameter is used to carry this information in
   ANSI ISUP [6] rather than the CPC parameter.  Legacy multifrequency
   (MF) signaling networks carry this information in the ANI II
   Digits [7].  The tel URI parameter specified in this document is
   designed to carry data from these sources as well.

2.  Parameter Definition

   The Calling Party's Category is represented as a tel URI parameter.
   The ABNF [2] syntax is as follows:

      cpc           = cpc-tag "=" cpc-value
      cpc-tag       = "cpc"
      cpc-value     = "ordinary" / "prison"   / "police"  / "test"
                      "operator" / "payphone" / "unknown" /
                      "hospital" / "cellular" / "cellular-roaming" /
                       genvalue

      genvalue      = 1*(alphanum / "-" / "." )

   The semantics of these Calling Party's Category values are described
   below:
      ordinary: The caller has been identified, and has no special
      features.
      test: This is a test call that has been originated as part of a
      maintenance procedure.
      operator: The call was generated by an operator position.
      payphone: The calling station is a payphone.
      prison: The calling station is in a prison.
      hotel: The calling station is in a hotel or motel.
      hospital: The calling station is in a medical facility.
      police: The calling station is associated with a branch of law
      enforcement.
      cellular: The calling station is a radio-telephone operating in
      its home network.
      cellular-roaming: The calling station is a radio-telephone roaming
      in another network
      unknown: The CPC could not be ascertained.

   An example of the syntax of the CPC parameter (in a small fragment of
   a SIP [4] message) is given below:

Internet-Draft                 CPC tel URI                      Aug 2006


           INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0
           To: "Bob" <sip:bob@biloxi.example.com>
           From: <tel:+17005554141;cpc=payphone>;tag=1928301774


3.  Usage

   The CPC is generally useful only when describing the originator of a
   telephone call.  Therefore, when this parameter is used in an
   application such as SIP, it is recommended that the parameter be
   applied to URIs that characterize the originator of a call (such as a
   SIP URI or tel URI in the From header field of a SIP message).  Note
   that many Calling Party's Category values from the PSTN were
   intentionally excluded from the cpc parameter as they are either
   meaningless outside of the PSTN or can be represented using another
   existing concept.  For example, the language of an operator can be
   expressed more richly using the Accept-Language header in SIP than in
   the cpc parameter.  Similarly the priority of a call is a
   characteristic of the call and not the calling party.

   It is anticipated that this URI parameter will be used primarily by
   gateways that interwork ISUP networks with SIP networks.  Various SIP
   network intermediaries might consult the CPC as they make routing
   decisions, although no specific behavior is prescribed in this
   document.  While no specific mapping of the various ISUP parameters
   that contain CPC data is offered in this document, creating such a
   mapping would be trivial.

   If the CPC parameter is not present, consumers of the CPC should
   treat the URI as if it specified a CPC of "ordinary".

   At most, one instance of the CPC can be associated with a particular
   URI.

4.  Security Considerations

   The information contained in the CPC parameter may be of a private
   nature, and it may not be appropriate for this value to be revealed
   to the destination user (typically it would not be so revealed in the
   PSTN).  For more information about privacy issues in SIP see RFC3323
   [5].

   Otherwise, this mechanism adds no new security considerations to
   those discussed in [1].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no action by IANA.
