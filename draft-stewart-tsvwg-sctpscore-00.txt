Internet-Draft               Bakeoff Scoring                    May 2002


1. Introduction

   This document will be used as a basis for point scoring at upcoming
   SCTP bakeoffs.  Its purpose is similar to that described in RFC1025.
   It is hoped that a clear definition of where and how to score points
   will further the development of SCTP RFC2960 [4].

   Note that while attending a bakeoff no one else will score your
   points for you.  We trust that all implementations will faithfully
   record their points that are received honestly.  Note also that these
   scores are NOT to be used for marketing purposes.  They are for the
   use of the implementations to know how well they are doing.  The only
   reporting that will be done is a basic summary to the Transport Area
   Working Group but please note that NO company or implementation names
   will be attached.

   Note Bene: Checksums must be enforced.   No points will be awarded if
   the checksum test is disabled.

2. Base protocol

   The base protocol is described in the follwing documents:

      RFC2960 [4]

      IMPLGUIDE [5]

      SCTPIPV4 [8]

      SCTPIPV6 [7]

      CHKSUM [6]


2.1 Basic Communication

   These points will be scored for EACH peer implementation that you
   successfully communicate with.

      2 points for being the sender of the INIT chunk and completing
      setup of an association.

      2 points for being the sender of the INIT-ACK chunk and completing
      setup of an association.

      1 point for sending data on the association where you sent the
      INIT.

      1 point for sending data on the association where you sent the
      INIT-ACK.

      2 points for gracefully ending the conversation by being the
      sender of the SHUTDOWN.

      2 points for gracefully ending the conversation by being the
      sender of the SHUTDOWN-ACK.

      4 points for repeating the above without reinitializing the SCTP.

   In order to receive all of the above points (14) an implementation
   will need to:

   o  send a INIT chunk and setup an association.

   o  send a data chunk on that association.

   o  receive a data chunk on that association.

Internet-Draft               Bakeoff Scoring                    May 2002


   o  send a SHUTDOWN chunk and bring the association to a close.

   o  receive a INIT-ACK and setup a new association (after the previous
      one is closed).

   o  send a data chunk on that association.

   o  receive a data chunk on that association.

   o  receive a SHUTDOWN chunk and send a SHUTDOWN-ACK and close the
      association.

   o  without restarting repeat these steps once.

   You can get 5 extra points if you do not include any address
   parameter in the INIT-/INIT-ACK chunk in case you are using ony one
   of your addresses.

2.2 Beyond Basic Communication

      10 points for bring up multiple associations at the same time to
      different implementations.  The implementation must send and
      receive data on both associations simultaneously.

      15 points for correctly handling ECN.

      10 points for correctly handling both Transmission Sequence Number
      (TSN) and Stream Sequence Number (SSN) wrap around.

      5  points for correctly being able to process a "Kamikaze" packet
      (AKA nastygram, christmas tree packet, lamp test segment, et al.).
      That is, correctly handle a segment with the maximum combination
      of features at once (e.g., a  COOKIE-ECHO, SACK, ASCONF, UNKNOWN-
      CHUNK, SHUTDOWN).

      5  additional points if the response to the "Kamikaze" packet is
      bundled.

      10 additional points if the implementation supports ECN and thus
      the "Kamikaze" packet is expanded to include COOKIE-ECHO, SACK,
      ECN, ASCONF, UNKNOWN-CHUNK, SHUTDOWN.

      30 points for KOing your opponent with legal blows.  (That is,
      operate a connection until one SCTP or the other crashes, the
      surviving SCTP has KOed the other.  Legal blows are chunks that
      meet the requirements of the specification.)

      20 points for KOing your opponent with dirty blows.  (Dirty blows

Internet-Draft               Bakeoff Scoring                    May 2002


      are packets or chunks that violate the requirements of the
      specification.)

      10 points for showing your opponents checksum is disabled or using
      the old checksum aka Adler-32 CHKSUM [6].

      10 points for showing you can fast-retransmit.

      10 points for showing your t3-timer retransmits to an alternate
      destination (aka uses the multi-homed facility during
      retransmission.

      10 points for properly demonstrating the partial delivery API.

      10 points for demonstrating recognition and proper handling of
      restart.

      10 points for correctly handling INIT collision.

      10 points for correctly handling a the STALE COOKIE case.

      10 points for doing bulk transfer for over 10 Minutes at a high
      constant rate.

      5 points for handling the restart with a data transfer after that.

      10 points for proving that your opponent accepts additional
      addresses during the restart compared to the original association.

3. Protocol Extensions

3.1 Partial reliable SCTP

   This extension is currently being described in PRSCTP [10]

      10 points for sending a FWD-TSN to skip a "timed-out" data chunk.

      10 points for correctly adopting the new cumulative-ack point
      indicated by a FWD-TSN.

      10 points for freeing data chunks to the application that were
      held awaiting the FWD-TSN.

      10 points for properly handling the partial-delivery API where the
      last part of a message already being delivered is subjected to a
      FWD-TSN.


3.2 AddIP

   This extension is currently being described in ADDIP [9].

      10 points for adding an IP address to an existing association.

      10 points for deleting an IP address from an existing association.

      10 points for requesting that your peer set a primary address.

      10 points for showing that you honored the request to set a
      primary address and thus adopted a new primary address.

      10 points for showing that your opponent does not do the address
      scoping as described in SCTPIPV4 [8] and SCTPIPV6 [7] correctly.

4. Bonus Points

   You can also Bonus Points (directly from RFC1025 [1] :>)

      10 points for the best excuse.

      20 points for the fewest excuses.

      30 points for the longest conversation.

      40 points for the most simultaneous connections.

      50 points for the most simultaneous connections with distinct
      SCTPs.

      50 points for hijacking an existing association between other
      participants.
