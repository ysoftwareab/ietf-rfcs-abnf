Abstract

   With the DS record [1] the concept of key signing and zone signing
   keys has been introduced.  Key signing keys are the keys that sign
   the keyset only.  In general, key signing keys are the keys that are
   pointed to by DS records and are the first keys to be used when
   following a chain of trust into the zone.  The key signing keys only
   sign the KEY RRset at the apex of a zone, zone signing keys sign all
   data in a zone.  We propose a flag to distinguish the key signing key
   from other keys in the KEY RR set during DNSSEC operations.

Internet-Draft        KEY RR Key Signing (KS) Flag        September 2002


1. Introduction

   "All keys are equal but some keys are more equal than others" [2]

   With the DS record [1] the concept of key signing and zone signing
   keys has been introduced.  In general these are the keys that are
   pointed to by DS records and are the first keys to be used when
   following the chain of trust into a zone ( secure entry points of the
   zone).  These key signing keys may also be configured in resolver
   systems that use zones as a trusted root[4] for a secure island.

   Early deployment tests have shown that during the key-exchange
   between the parent and the child it is useful to indicate which keys
   are to be used as the secure entry point to a zone.  We introduce the
   Key Signing Key flag to indicate this special 'administrative' status
   of the key.  The availability of the flag allows the key exchange to
   be automated where, without the flag, some additional out-of-band
   communication is needed.

                                KEY RR Format



   The bit 15th bit (TBD) in the flags field is assigned to be the key
   signing flag.  If set the key is intended to be used as key signing
   key.  If the bit is not set, no special meaning should be assigned.
   The 15th bit is currently reserved [3].

3. DNSSEC Protocol Changes

   The use of the KS flag does not change the DNS resolution and
   resolution protocol.  The KS flag is only used to provide a hint
   about the different administrative properties and MUST NOT be used
   during the resolving process.

4. Operational Guidelines

   By setting the KS flag on a particular key, zone administrators
   indicate that that key should be used as the secure entry point for
   their zone.  Therefore zone administrators SHOULD set the bit only
   for zone keys that are used to sign the KEY RRset and are intended to
   act as the first link in the chain of trust for their zone.

   Parent zone administrators and resolver administrators that want to
   configure a keysigning key as their 'trusted key' MAY choose to
   ignore the flag.

   Using the flag a key rollover can be automated.  The parent can use
   an existing trust relation to verify keysets in which a new key with
   the KS flag appears.

   If the bit is modified during the lifetime of the key then this would
   have impact on the keytag and on the hash data in the DS RRs
   intending to point to this key.  The bit SHOULD NOT be modified once
   the key has been put into use.

5. Security Considerations

   The flag MUST NOT be used in the resolution protocol or to determine
   the security status of a key.  The flag is to be used for
   administrative purposes only.

   No trust in a key should be inferred from this flag - trust must be
   inferred from an existing chain of trust or an out-of-band exchange.

   Since this flag MAY be used for automating key exchanges, we think
   the following consideration is in place.

   Automated mechanisms for rollover of the DS RR may be vulnerable to a
   class of replay attacks.  This may happen after a key exchange where
   a keyset, containing two keys with the KS flag set, is sent to the
   parent.  The parent verifies the keyset with the existing trust
   relation and creates the new DS RR from the key that the current DS
   is not pointing to.  This key exchange may be replayed, if the parent
   does not maintain state of which DS RRs where used previously so that
   the new DS RR is replaced by the old DS RR again.  These kinds of
   attacks can be prevented by maintaining a registry of keys that have
   been used to generate DS RRs from previously.

Internet-Draft        KEY RR Key Signing (KS) Flag        September 2002


6.1 draft version 00 -> 01

      Clean up of references and correction of typos;

      modified Abstract text a little;

      Added explicit warning for replay attacks to the security section;

      Removed the text that hinted on a distinction between a keysigning
      key configured in resolvers and in parent zones.


7. Acknowledgments

   The ideas documented in this draft are inspired by communications we
   had with numerous people and ideas published by other folk, Olafur
   Gudmundsson, Daniel Karrenberg, Dan Massey and Sam Weiler have been
   helping with providing ideas and feedback.

   This document saw the light during a workshop on DNSSEC operations
   hosted by USC/ISI.
