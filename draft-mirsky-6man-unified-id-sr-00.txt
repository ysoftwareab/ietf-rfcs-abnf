          Unified Identifier in IPv6 Segment Routing Networks
                   draft-mirsky-6man-unified-id-sr-00

Abstract

   Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source
   routing.  It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending
   the packet with a list of instructions, a.k.a. segments.  A segment
   can be encoded as an Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) label,
   IPv4 address or IPv6 address.  Segment Routing can be applied in MPLS
   data plane by encoding segments in MPLS label stack.  It also can be
   applied to IPv6 data plane by encoding list of segment identifiers in
   IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH).  This document extends
   the use of the SRH to segment identifiers encoded as MPLS label and
   IPv4 address.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing architecture [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]
   leverages the paradigm of source routing.  It can be realized in a
   network data plane by prepending the packet with a list of
   instructions, a.k.a. segment identifiers (SIDs).  A segment can be
   encoded as an Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4
   address or IPv6 address.  Segment Routing can be applied in MPLS data
   plane by encoding 20-bits SIDs in MPLS label stack
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].  It also can be applied to
   IPv6 data plane by encoding list of 128-bits SIDs in IPv6 Segment
   Routing Extension Header (SRH)
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].  Applicability of 32-bits
   SID, that may represent IPv4 address, has not been defined.

   SR extensions to Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP), IS-IS
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions], OSPF
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions], and OSPFv3
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-segment-routing-extensions], defined how
   20-bits and 32-bits SIDs advertised and bound to SR objects and/or
   instructions.  Extensions to BGP link-state address family
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext] enabled propagation of
   segment information of variable length via BGP.

   This document extends the use of the SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] to SIDs encoded as MPLS label
   and IPv4 address.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Segment Routing Extension Header: Benefits and Challenges

   Many functions related to Operation, Administration and Maintenance
   (OAM) require identification of the SR tunnel ingress and the path,
   constructed by segments, between the ingress and the egress SR nodes.
   Combination of IPv6 encapsulation [RFC8200] and SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header], referred to as SRv6, comply
   with this requirements while it is challenging when applying SR in
   MPLS networks, also referred to as MPLS-SR.

   On the other hand, size of IPv6 SID presents scaling challenge to use
   topological instructions that define strict explicit traffic
   engineered (TE) path in combination with service-based instructions.

   At the same time, that is where MPLS-SR approach provides better
   results due to smaller SID length.

   [I-D.bryant-mpls-unified-ip-sr] addresses the scaling challenge by
   using more compact SID encoding of MPLS-SR.  Ability to address OAM
   challenge characteristic to MPLS-SR is open for investigation.

3.  Support of Multiple SID Lengths in IPv6 Segment Routing Extension
    Header

   In section 3 of [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] SRH format has

   This document defines the new field Size in the Flags field,
   presented in Figure 2, as two-bits field with the following values:

      0b00 - 128-bits SID;

      0b01 - 20-bits SID;

      0b10 - 32-bits SID

      0b11 - reserved for future use.

   When the value of the S field is 0b01, the 20-bit SID is encoded in
   four octets and occupies the 20 rightmost bits.

                       Figure 2: Flags field format

   Entries of the segment list in the SRH MUST be of the same length.

4.  Theory of Operation

   When the SRH is used to include 20-bits or 32-bits SIDs the ingress
   and transit nodes of an SR tunnel act as described in Section 5.1 and
   Section 5.2 of [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] respectively.

   TBD

5.  IANA Considerations

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification inherits all security considerations of
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].
