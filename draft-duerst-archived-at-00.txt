Internet-Draft        The Archived-At Email Header         February 2004


1. Introduction

    [RFC2369] defines a number of header fields that can be added to
    email messages send by email distribution lists. One of them is the
    'List-Archive' header field that describes how to access archives for
    the list. This allows to access the archives as a whole, but not the
    individual message.

    There is often a need or desire to refer to the archived form of a
    single message. This memo defines a new header, 'Archived-At', to
    refer to a single message in an archive.

2. Syntax Definition

    The name of the header field is 'Archived-At'. The content of the
    header field is an URI [RFC2369] pointing to an archived version of
    the message.

    This header field is subject to the encoding and character
    restrictions for mail headers as described in [RFC2822].
    Additionally, the URI content is further restricted to the set of URI
    safe characters [RFC2396].

    OPEN ISSUE: For the current X-Archived-At: header, the syntax is very
    straightforward, just an URI, without '<' and '>', and not allowing
    for comments (or at least we haven't used them at all yet). Question:
    should we leave this as is, or move to a syntax more similar with
    [RFC2369]?

3. Supporting Nested Lists

    If a message is forwarded from a list to a sublist, and both lists
    support adding the Archived-At header field, then the sublist should
    add a new Archived-At header field without removing the already
    existing one(s).

4. Implementation Considerations

    This section shortly discusses some implementation considerations.
    Mailing list expanders and email archives are often separate pieces
    of software. This may make it difficult for the mailing list expander
    to create an 'Archived-At' header field.

    W3C uses a setup that allows to use the message id of the incoming
    mail, combined with a lookup in a database and HTTP redirection, to
    find the actual message. As an example, the URI
    "http://www.w3.org/mid/1057271304.16158.44.camel@dirk.dm93.org",
    containing the message id

    "1057271304.16158.44.camel@dirk.dm93.org", is redirected to the usual
    mailing-list archive URI at
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ietf-w3c/2003Jul/
    0000.html.

    When using the message id to create an address for the archived mail,
    care has to be taken to escape characters in the message id that are
    not allowed in the URI.

5. Security Considerations

6. Acknowledgements

    The members of the W3C system team, in particular Gerald Oskoboiny,
    Olivier Thereaux, and Jose Kahan, created the mid-based email archive
    lookup system and the experimental form of the Archived-At header.
    Pete Resnik provided the motivation for writing up this draft.
