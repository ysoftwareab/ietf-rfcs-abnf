Signature = r || s || PVT   where r and s are octet strings of length
N = Ceiling(lg(p)/8) representing
N = Ceiling(n/8)      The number of octets used to represent
                            fields r and s in a Signature.  Also the
                            number of octets output by the Hash Function
                            (see below). 
 
Jx = r  modulo p.
