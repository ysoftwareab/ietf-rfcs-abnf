Abstract

   The Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States
   Department of Defense, with its contractors, has proposed a service
   architecture for military (NATO and related agencies) telephone
   systems. This is called the Assured Service, and is defined in two
   documents: "Architecture for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice
   over IP" and "Requirements for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice
   over IP". Responding to these are two documents:  "Extending the
   Session Initiation Protocol Reason Header to account for Preemption
   Events", "Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation
   Protocol".

   What remains to this specification is to provide a Call Admission

   Control procedure and a Per Hop Behavior for the data which meet the
   needs of this architecture. Such a CAC procedure and PHB is
   appropriate to any service that might use H.323 or SIP to set up real

   and Video applications, although at this writing the community is
   mostly thinking about Voice on IP and many of the examples in the
   document are taken from that environment.

   In a world where a call once permitted is never later refused by the
   network; only considering setup might be sufficient. However in a
   network where sessions status can be reviewed by the network and
   preempted or refused due to changes in routing (when the new routes
   lack capacity to carry calls switched to them) or changes in offered
   load (higher precedence calls supercede existing calls), this
   requires maintaining a continuing model of the status of various
   calls are using the network.

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


1. Overview

   The Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States
   Department of Defense, with is contractors, has proposed a service
   architecture for military (NATO and related agencies) telephone
   systems. This is called the Assured Service, and is defined in two
   documents: [I-D.pierce-ieprep-assured-service-arch] and
   [I-D.pierce-ieprep-assured-service-req]. Responding to these are two
   documents: [I-D.ietf-sipping-reason-header-for-preemption] and
   [I-D.ietf-sip-resource-priority].

   What remains to this specification is to provide a Call Admission
   Control procedure and a Per Hop Behavior for the data which meet the
   needs of this architecture. Such a CAC procedure and PHB is
   appropriate to any service that might use H.323 or SIP to set up real
   time sessions. These obviously include but are not limited to Voice
   and Video applications, although at this writing the community is
   mostly thinking about Voice on IP and many of the examples in the
   document are taken from that environment.

   In a world where a call once permitted is never later refused by the
   network; only considering setup might be sufficient. However in a
   network where sessions status can be reviewed by the network and
   preempted or refused due to changes in routing (when the new routes
   lack capacity to carry calls switched to them) or changes in offered
   load (higher precedence calls supercede existing calls), this
   requires maintaining a continuing model of the status of various
   calls are using the network.

1.1 Multi-Level Preemption and Precedence

   Before doing so, however, let us discuss the problem that MLPP is
   intended to solve and the architecture of the system. The Assured
   Service is designed as an IP implementation of an existing ITU-T/
   NATO/DoD telephone system architecture known as
   [ITU.MLPP.1990][ANSI.MLPP.Spec][ANSI.MLPP.Supplement], or MLPP. MLPP
   is an architecture for a prioritized call handling service such that
   in times of emergency in the relevant NATO and DoD commands, the
   relative importance of various kinds of communications is strictly
   defined, allowing higher priority communication at the expense of
   lower priority communications. These priorities, in descending order,
   are:

   Flash Override Override: used by the Commander in Chief, Secretary of
      Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff, Commanders of combatant
      commands when declaring the existence of a state of war.
      Commanders of combatant commands when declaring Defense Condition
      One or Defense Emergency or Air Defense Emergency and other

      national authorities that the President may authorize in
      conjunction with Worldwide Secure Voice Conferencing System
      conferences. Flash Override Override cannot be preempted.

   Flash Override: used by the Commander in Chief, Secretary of Defense,
      and Joint Chiefs of Staff, Commanders of combatant commands when
      declaring the existence of a state of war. Commanders of combatant
      commands when declaring Defense Condition One or Defense Emergency
      and other national authorities the President may authorize. Flash
      Override cannot be preempted in the DSN.

   Flash: reserved generally for telephone calls pertaining to command
      and control of military forces essential to defense and
      retaliation, critical intelligence essential to national survival,
      conduct of diplomatic negotiations critical to the arresting or
      limiting of hostilities, dissemination of critical civil alert
      information essential to national survival, continuity of federal
      government functions essential to national survival, fulfillment
      of critical internal security functions essential to national
      survival, or catastrophic events of national or international
      significance.

   Immediate: reserved generally for telephone calls pertaining to
      situations that gravely affect the security of national and allied
      forces, reconstitution of forces in a post-attack period,
      intelligence essential to national security, conduct of diplomatic
      negotiations to reduce or limit the threat of war, implementation
      of federal government actions essential to national survival,
      situations that gravely affect the internal security of the
      nation, Civil Defense actions, disasters or events of extensive
      seriousness having an immediate and detrimental effect on the
      welfare of the population, or vital information having an
      immediate effect on aircraft, spacecraft, or missile operations.

   Priority: reserved generally for telephone calls requiring
      expeditious action by called parties and/or furnishing essential
      information for the conduct of government operations.

   Routine: designation applied to those official government
      communications that require rapid transmission by telephonic means
      but do not require preferential handling.

   The rule, in MLPP, is that more important calls override less
   important calls when congestion occurs within a network. Station
   based preemption is used when a more important call needs to be
   placed to either party in an existing call. Trunk based preemption is
   used when trunk bandwidth needs to be reallocated to facilitate a
   higher precedence call over a given path in the network. In both



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   station and trunk based preemption scenarios, preempted parties are
   positively notified, via preemption tone, that their call can no
   longer be supported. The same preemption tone is used, regardless of
   whether calls are terminated for the purposes of station of trunk
   based preemption. The remainder of this discussion focuses on trunk
   based preemption issues.

   MLPP is built as a proactive system in which callers must assign one
   of the precedence levels listed above at call initiation; this
   precedence level cannot be changed throughout that call. If an
   elevated status is not assigned by a user at call initiation time,
   the call is assumed to be "routine". If there is end to end capacity
   to place a call, any call may be placed at any time. However, when
   any trunk (in the circuit world) or interface (in an IP world)
   reaches a utilization threshold, a choice must be made as to which
   calls to accept or allow to continue. The system will seize the
   trunks or bandwidth necessary to place the more important calls in
   preference to less important calls by preempting an existing call (or
   calls) of lower precedence to permit a higher precedence call to be
   placed.

   More than one call might properly be preempted if more trunks or
   bandwidth is necessary for this higher precedence call. A video call
   (perhaps of 384 KBPS, or 6 trunks) competing with several lower
   precedence voice calls is a good example of this situation.

1.2 Definition of Call Admission

   Traditionally, in the PSTN, "Call Admission Control", or CAC, has had
   the responsibility of determining whether a caller has permission (an
   identified subscriber, with identify attested to by appropriate
   credentials, is authorized) to use an available circuit. MLPP, or any
   emergency telephone service, creates two feedback paths in the
   algorithm: if a caller is authorized to use a higher precedence, he
   may also be authorized to use other networks, or the PSTN may be
   obligated to preempt a call if possible and necessary to create
   appropriate bandwidth, or it may be authorized to use a guard band of
   bandwidth that other callers are not. At the completion of CAC,
   however, the caller either has a circuit that he or she is authorized
   to use, or has no circuit. Since the act of preemption or
   consideration of alternative bandwidth sources is part and parcel of
   the problem of providing bandwidth, and the authorization step in
   bandwidth provision also affects the choice of networks that may be
   authorized to be considered. The three cannot be separated. The CAC
   procedure finds available bandwidth that the caller is authorized to
   use, and preemption may in some networks be part of making that
   happen.

1.3 Assumptions about the Network

   IP networks generally fall into two categories: those with
   constrained bandwidth, and those that are massively overprovisioned.
   In a network wherein over any interval that can be measured
   (including sub-second intervals) capacity exceeds offered load by at
   least 2:1, the jitter and loss incurred in transit are nominal. This
   is generally a characteristic of properly engineered Ethernet LANs
   and of optical networks (networks that measure their link speeds in
   multiples of 51 MBPS); in the latter, circuit-switched networking
   solutions such as ATM, MPLS, and GMPLS can be used to explicitly
   place routes, and so improve the odds a bit.

   Between those networks, in places commonly called "inter-campus
   links", "access links" or "access networks", for various reasons
   including technology and cost, it is common to find links whose
   offered load can approximate or exceed the available capacity. Such
   events may be momentary, or may occur for extended periods of time.

   In addition, primarily in tactical deployments, it is common to find
   bandwidth constraints in the local infrastructure of networks. For
   example, the US Navy's network afloat connects approximately 300
   ships, via satellite, to five network operation centers, and those
   NOCs are in turn interconnected via the DISA backbone. A typical ship
   may have between two and six radio systems aboard, often at speeds of
   64 KBPS or less. In US Army networks, current radio technology
   likewise limits tactical communications to links below 100 KBPS.
   Future radio capabilities are projected to be on the order of 1-10
   MBPS, but certainly less than 45 MBPS.

   Over this infrastructure, military communications expect to deploy
   voice communication systems (30-80 KBPS per session), video
   conferencing using MPEG 2 (3-7 MBPS) and MPEG 4 (80 KBPS to 800
   KBPS), in addition to traditional mail, file transfer, and
   transaction traffic.

1.4 Assumptions about application behavior

   Parekh and Gallagher published a series of papers [Parekh1][Parekh2]
   analyzing what is necessary to ensure a specified service level for a
   stream of traffic. In a nutshell, they showed that to predict the
   behavior of a stream of traffic in a network, one must know two
   things:

   o  the rate and arrival distribution with which traffic in a class is
      introduced to the network, and

   o  what network elements will do, in terms of the departure



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


      distribution, injected delay jitter and loss characteristics, with
      the traffic they see.

   For example, TCP tunes its effective window (the amount of data it
   sends per round trip interval) so that the ratio of the window and
   the round trip interval approximate the available capacity in the
   network. As long as the round trip delay remains roughly stable and
   loss is nominal (which are primarily behaviors of the network), TCP
   is able to maintain a predictable level of throughput. In an
   environment where loss is random or in which delays wildly vary, TCP
   behaves in a far less predictable manner.

   Voice and video systems do not tune their behavior to that of the
   network. Rather, they send traffic at a rate specified by the codec
   depending on what it perceives is required. In an MPEG-4 system, for
   example, if the camera is pointed at a wall, the codec determines
   that an 80 KBPS data stream will describe that wall, and issues that
   amount of traffic. If a person walks in front of the wall or the
   camera is pointed an a moving object, the codec may easily send 800
   KBPS in its effort to accurately describe what it sees. In commercial
   broadcast sports, which may line up periods in which advertisements
   are displayed, the effect is that traffic rates suddenly jump across
   all channels at certain times because the eye-catching ads require
   much more bandwidth than the camera pointing at the green football
   field.

   As described in [RFC1633], when dealing with a real-time application,
   there are basically two things one must do to ensure Parekh's first
   requirement. To ensure that one knows how much offered load the
   application is presenting, one must police (measure load offered and
   discard excess) traffic entering the network. If that policing
   behavior has a debilitating effect on the application, as
   non-negligible loss has on voice or video, one must admit sessions
   judiciously according to some policy. A key characteristic of that
   policy must be that the offered load does not exceed the capacity
   dedicated to the application.

   In the network, the other thing one must do is ensure that the
   application's needs are met in terms of loss, variation in delay, and
   end to end delay. One way to do this is to supply sufficient
   bandwidth that loss and jitter are nominal. Where that cannot be
   accomplished, one must use queuing technology to deterministically
   apply bandwidth to accomplish the goal.

1.5 Desired Characteristics in an Internet Environment

   The key elements of the MLPP service include the following:




Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   Precedence Level Marking each call: Call initiators choose the
      appropriate precedence level for each call based on user perceived
      importance of the call. This level is not to be changed for the
      duration of the call. The call before, and the call after are
      independent with regard to this level choice.

   Call Admission/Preemption Policy: There is likewise a clear policy
      regarding calls that may be in progress at the called instrument.
      During call admission (SIP/H.323), if they are of lower
      precedence, they must make way according to a prescribed
      procedure. All callers on the preempted call must be informed that
      the call has been preempted, and the call must make way for the
      higher precedence call.

   Bandwidth Admission Policy: There is a clear bandwidth admission
      policy: sessions may be placed which assert any of several levels
      of precedence, and in the event that there is demand and
      authorization is granted, other sessions will be preempted to make
      way for a call of higher precedence.

   Authentication and Authorization of calls placed: Unauthorized
      attempts to place a call at an elevated status are not permitted.
      In the telephone system, this is managed by controlling the policy
      applied to an instrument by its switch plus a code produced by the
      caller identifying himself or herself to the switch. In the
      Internet, such characteristics must be explicitly signaled.

   Voice handling characteristics: A call made, in the telephone system,
      gets a circuit, and provides the means for the callers to conduct
      their business without significant impact as long as their call is
      not preempted. In a VoIP system, one would hope for essentially
      the same service.

   Defined User Interface: If a call is preempted, the caller and the
      callee are notified via a defined signal, so that they know that
      their call has been preempted and that at this instant there is no
      alternative circuit available to them at that precedence level.

   A VoIP implementation of the MLPP service must, by definition,
   provide those characteristics.

1.6 The use of bandwidth as a solution for QoS

   There is a discussion in Internet circles concerning the relationship
   of bandwidth to QoS procedures, which needs to be put to bed before
   this procedure can be adequately analyzed. The issue is that it is
   possible and common in certain parts of the Internet to solve the
   problem with bandwidth. In LAN environments, for example, if there is



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   significant loss between any two switches or between a switch and a
   server, the simplest and cheapest solution is to buy the next faster
   interface - substitute 100 MBPS for 10 MBPS Ethernet, 1 Gigabit for
   100 MBPS, or for that matter upgrade to a ten gigabit Ethernet.
   Similarly, in optical networking environments, the simplest and
   cheapest solution is often to increase the data rate of the optical
   path either by selecting a faster optical carrier or deploying an
   additional lambda. In places where the bandwidth can be
   overprovisioned to a point where loss or queuing delay are
   negligible, 10:1 overprovisioning is often the cheapest and surest
   solution, and by the way offers a growth path for future
   requirements. However, there are places in communication networks
   where bandwidth is not free and is therefore not effectively
   infinite. It is in these places, and only these places, where the
   question of resource management is relevant.

   The places where bandwidth constriction takes place is typically
   where one pays a significant amount for bandwidth, such as in access
   paths, or where available technology limits the options. In military
   networks, Type 1 encryption often presents such a barrier, as do
   satellite links and various kinds of radio systems.

   In short, the fact that we are discussing this class of policy
   control says that such constrictions in the network exist and must be
   dealt with. Get over it. However much we might like to, in those
   places we are not solving this with bandwidth.

   Figure 1: Typical VoIP or Video/IP Network

   Reviewing that figure, it becomes obvious that call flows are very
   different than call flows in the PSTN. In the PSTN, call control
   traverses a switch, which in turn controls data handling services
   like ATM switches or circuit multiplexors. While they may not be
   physically co-located, the control plane software and the data plane
   services are closely connected; the switch routes a call using
   bandwidth that it knows is available. In a voice/video-on-IP network,
   call control is completely divorced from the data plane: It is
   possible for a telephone instrument in the United States to have a
   Swedish telephone number if that is where its SIP proxy happens to
   be, but on a given call use only data paths in the Asia/Pacific
   region, data paths provided by a different company, and often
   multiple companies.

   Call management therefore addresses a variety of questions, all of
   which must be answered:

   o  May I make this call from an administrative policy perspective?

   o  What IP address correlates with this telephone number or SIP URI?

   o  Is the other instrument "on hook"? If it is busy, under what
      circumstances may I interrupt?

   o  Is there bandwidth available to support the call?

   o  Does it actually work?


2.1 Call admission/preemption procedure

   Administrative Call Admission is the objective of SIP and H.323. It
   asks fundamental questions like "what IP address is the callee at?"
   and "Did you pay your bill?".

   For specialized policy like call preemption, two capabilities are
   necessary from an administrative perspective:
   [I-D.ietf-sip-resource-priority] provides a way to communicate
   policy-related information regarding the precedence of the call; and
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-reason-header-for-preemption] provides a reason
   code when a call fails or is refused, indicating the cause of the
   event. If it is a failure, it may make sense to redial the call. If
   it is a policy-driven preemption, even if the call is redialed it may
   not be possible to place the call.

   The Communications Resource Priority Header (or RP Header) serves the
   call set-up process with the precedence level chosen by the initiator
   of the call. The syntax is in the form:

        Resource Priority : namespace.priority level

   The "namespace" part of the syntax ensures the domain of significance
   to the originator of the call, and this travels end-to-end to the
   destination (called) device (phone). If the receiving phone does not
   support the namespace, it can easily ignore (what
   [I-D.ietf-sip-resource-priority] calls "loose mode") or errors (what
   [I-D.ietf-sip-resource-priority] calls "strict mode") the set-up
   request. This ability to denote the domain of origin allows SLAs to
   be in place to limit the ability of an unknown requestor to gain
   preferential treatment into an MLPP domain.

   For the DSN infrastructure, this header would look like this:

        Resource Priority : dsn.routine

   for a routine precedence level call. The priority level chosen in
   this header would be compared to the requestor's authorization



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   profile to user that priority level. This would typically occur in
   the first hop SIP Proxy server which can challenge many aspects of
   the call set-up request, including the requestor choice of priority
   levels (verifying they aren't using a level they are not authorized
   to use.

   The DSN has 5 precedence levels of MLPP in descending order:

        dsn.flash-override

        dsn.flash

        dsn.immediate

        dsn.priority

        dsn.routine

   The US Defense Red Switched Network (DRSN), as another example that
   is to be IANA registered in [I-D.ietf-sip-resource-priority], has 6
   levels of precedence. The DRSN simply adds one higher precedence
   level than flash-override:

        drsn.flash-override-override

   to be used by the President and a select few others. Note that the
   namespace changed for this level. The lower 5 levels within the DRSN
   would also have this as their namespace for all DRSN originated call
   set-up requests.

   This informs both the use of DSCPs by the callee (who needs to use
   the same DSCP as the caller to obtain the same data path service) and
   to facilitate policy-based preemption of calls in progress when
   appropriate.

   Once a call is established in an MLPP domain, the Reason Header for
   Preemption, described in
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-reason-header-for-preemption], ensures that all SIP
   nodes are synchronized to a preemption event occurring either at the
   endpoint or in a router that experiences congestion. In SIP, the
   normal indication for the end of a session is for one end system to
   send a BYE Method request as specified in [RFC3261]. This, too, is
   the proper means for signaling a termination of a call due to a
   preemption event, as it essentially performs a normal termination
   with additional information informing the peer of the reason for the
   abrupt end - it indicates that a preemption occurred. This will be
   used to inform all relevant SIP entities, and whether this was a
   endpoint generated preemption event, or that the preemption event

   occurred within a router along the communications path (described in
   Section 2.3.1 ).

2.2 Voice handling characteristics

   The Quality of Service architecture used in the data path is that of
   [RFC2475]. Differentiated Services uses a flag in the IP header
   called the [RFC2474] to identify a data stream, and then applies a
   procedure called a Per Hop Behavior, or PHB, to it. This is largely
   as described in the [RFC2998].

   In the data path, the Expedited Forwarding PHB [RFC3246][RFC3247]
   describes the fundamental needs of voice and video traffic. This PHB
   entails ensuring that sufficient bandwidth is dedicated to real-time
   traffic to ensure minimal variation in delay and a minimal loss rate,
   as codecs are hampered by excessive loss
   [G711.1][G711.2][G711.3][G711.4][G711.5][ILBC]. In parts of the
   network where bandwidth is heavily overprovisioned, there may be no
   remaining concern. In places in the network where bandwidth is more
   constrained, this may require the use of a priority queue. If a
   priority queue is used, the potential for abuse exists, meaning that
   it is also necessary to police traffic placed into the queue to
   detect and manage abuse. A fundamental question is "where does this
   policing need to take place?". The obvious places would be the first
   hop routers and any place where converging data streams might congest
   a link.

   For policy reasons, DISA would like to mark traffic with various code
   points marked with code points appropriate to the service level of
   the call. In normal service, if the traffic is all in the same queue
   and EF service requirements are met (applied capacity exceeds offered
   load, variation in delay is minimal, and loss is negligible), details
   of traffic marking should be irrelevant, as long as they get the
   packets into the right service class. The question is primarily one
   of appropriate policing of traffic, especially around route changes.

   The real time voice/video application should be generating traffic at
   a rate appropriate to its content and codec, which is either a
   constant bit rate stream or a stream whose rate is variable within a
   specified range. The first hop router should be policing traffic
   originated by the application, as is performed in traditional virtual
   circuit networks like Frame Relay and ATM. Between these two, the
   application traffic should be guaranteed to be within acceptable
   limits. As such, given bandwidth-aware call admission control, there
   should be minimal actual loss. The cases where loss would occur
   include cases where routing has recently changed and CAC has not
   caught up, or cases where statistical thresholds are in use in CAC
   and the data streams happen to coincide at their peak rates.



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   If it is demonstrated that routing transients and variable rate beat
   frequencies present a sufficient problem, it is possible to provide a
   policing mechanism that isolates intentional loss among an ordered
   set of classes. While the ability to do so, by various algorithms,
   has been demonstrated, the technical requirement has not. If dropping
   random packets from all calls is not appropriate, concentrating
   random loss in a subset of the calls makes the problem for those
   calls worse; a superior approach would reject or preempt an entire
   call.

   Parekh's second condition has been met: we must know what the network
   will do with the traffic. If the offered load exceeds the available
   bandwidth, the network will remark and drop the excess traffic. The
   key questions become "How does one limit offered load to a rate less
   than or equal to available bandwidth?" and "how much traffic does one
   admit with each appropriate marking?"

2.3 Bandwidth admission procedure

   Since the available voice and video codecs require a nominal loss
   rate to deliver acceptable performance, Parekh's first requirement is
   that offered load be within the available capacity. There are several
   possible approaches.

   An approach that is commonly used in H.323 networks is to limit the
   number of calls simultaneously accepted by the gatekeeper. SIP
   networks do something similar when they place a SIP proxy near a
   single ingress/egress to the network. This is able to impose an upper
   bound on the total number of call sin the network or the total number
   of calls crossing the significant link. However, the gatekeeper has
   no knowledge of routing, so the engineering must be very
   conservative, and usually requires a single ingress/egress - a single
   point of failure. While this may serve as a short term work-around,
   it is not a general solution that is readily deployed. This limits
   the options in network design.

   The [RFC1633] provides for signalled admission for the use of
   capacity. This is currently implemented using the Resource
   Reservation Protocol [RFC2205][RFC2209] (RSVP). The use of Capacity
   Admission with SIP is described in [RFC3312] ; at this writing,
   Capacity Admission is not integrated with H.323.

2.3.1 Recommended procedure: explicit call admission - RSVP Admission
      using Policy

   RSVP is a resource reservation setup protocol providing the one-way
   (at a time) setup of resource reservations for multicast and unicast
   flows. Each reservation is set up in one direction (meaning one



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   reservation from each end system; in a multicast environment, N
   senders set up N reservations). These reservations complete a
   communication path with a deterministic bandwidth allocation through
   each router along that path between end systems. These reservations
   setup a known quality of service for end-to-end communications and
   maintain a "soft-state" within a node. The meaning of the term "soft
   state" is that in the event of a network outage or change of routing,
   these reservations are cleared without manual intervention, but must
   be periodically refreshed. In RSVP, the refresh period is by default
   30 seconds, but may be as long as appropriate.

   RSVP is a local process, not a routing protocol - and uses the local
   routing databases to determine the path route. RSVP is only concerned
   with the quality of service for that flow through a device. RSVP is
   not aware of anything other than the local goal of QoS and its RSVP
   enabled adjacencies. The process by itself has no end-to-end
   knowledge.

   Below is the diagram of RSVP operation in Hosts (end systems) and
   Routers taken from [RFC2209].

   systems) and routers.

   RSVP uses the phrase "traffic control" to describe the mechanisms of
   how a data flow receives quality of service. There are 3 different
   mechanisms to traffic control (shown in Figure 2 in both hosts and
   routers). They are:

   A packet classifier mechanism: which resolves the QoS class for each
      packet; this can determine the route as well.

   An admission control mechanism: this consists of two decision
      modules: the admission control module and the policy control
      module. Determining whether there is satisfactory resources for
      the requested QoS is the function of admission control.
      Determining if the user has the authorization to request such
      resources is the function of policy control. If the parameters
      carried within this flow fail either of these two modules, RSVP
      errors the request.

   A packet scheduler mechanism: at each outbound interface, the
      scheduler attains the guaranteed QoS for that flow


2.3.2 RSVP Scaling Issues

   As originally written, RSVP had scaling limitations due to its data
   plane behavior. This has, in time, largely been corrected. In edge
   networks, RSVP is used to signal for individual microflows, admitting
   the bandwidth. However, Differentiated Services is used for the data
   plane behavior. Admission and policing may be performed anywhere, but
   need only be performed in the first hop router (which, if the end
   system sending the traffic is a DTE, constitutes a DCE for the
   remaining network) and in routers that have interfaces threatened by
   congestion. In figure 1, these would normally be the links that cross
   network boundaries, and may also include any type 1 encrypted
   interface, as these are generally limited in bandwidth by the
   encryption.

2.3.3 RSVP Operation in backbones and VPNs

   In backbone networks, networks that are normally awash in bandwidth,
   RSVP and its affected data flows may be carried in a variety of ways.
   If the backbone is a maze of tunnels between its edges - true of MPLS
   networks and of networks that carry traffic from an encryptor to a
   decryptor, and also of VPNs - applicable technologies include
   [RFC2207], [RFC2746], and [RFC2983]. An IP tunnel is simplistically a
   IP packet enveloped inside another IP packet as a payload. When IPv6
   is transported over an IPv4 network, encapsulating the entire v6
   packet inside a v4 packet is an effective means to accomplish this
   task. In this type of tunnel, the IPv6 packet is not read by any of



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   the routers while inside the IPv4 envelope. If the inner packet is
   RSVP enabled, there must be a active configuration to ensure that all
   relevant backbone nodes read the RSVP fields; [RFC2746] describes
   this.

   This is similar to how IPsec tunnels work. Encapsulating an RSVP
   packet inside an encrypted packet for security purposes without
   copying or conveying the RSVP indicators in the outside IP packet
   header would make RSVP inoperable while in this form of a tunnel.
   [RFC2207] describes how to modify an IPsec packet header to allow for
   RSVP awareness by nodes that need to provide QoS for the flow or
   flows inside a tunnel.

   Other networks may simply choose to aggregate the reservations across
   themselves as described in [RFC3175]. The problem with an individual
   reservation architecture is that each flow requires a non-trivial
   amount of message exchange, computation, and memory resources in each
   router between each endpoint. Aggregation of flows reduces the number
   of completely individual reservations into groups of individual flows
   that can act as one for part or all of the journey between end
   systems. Aggregates are not intended to be from the first router to
   the last router within a flow, but to cover common paths of a large
   number of individual flows.

   Examples of aggregated data flows include streams of IP data that
   traverse common ingress and egress points in a network, and also
   include tunnels of various kinds. MPLS LSPs, IPSEC Security
   Associations between VPN edge routers, similar tunnels between HAIPE
   encryptors and decryptors, IP/IP tunnels, and GRE tunnels all fall
   into this general category. The distinguishing factor is that the
   system injecting an aggregate into the aggregated network sums the
   PATH and RESV statistical information on the un-aggregated side and
   produces a reservation for the tunnel on the aggregated side. If the
   bandwidth for the tunnel cannot be expanded, RSVP leaves the existing
   reservation in place and returns an error to the aggregator, which
   can then apply a policy such as MLPP to determine which session to
   refuse. In the data plane, the DSCP for the traffic must be copied
   from the inner to the outer header, to preserve the PHB's effect.

   One concern with this approach is that this leaks information into
   the aggregated zone concerning the number of active calls or the
   bandwidth they consume. In fact, it does not, as the data itself is
   identifiable by aggregator address, deaggregator address, and DSCP.
   As such, even if it is not advertised, such information is
   measurable.

2.3.4 Interaction with the Differentiated Services Architecture

   In the PATH message, the DCLASS object described in [RFC2996] is used
   to carry the determined DSCP for the precedence level of that call in
   the stream. This is reflected back in the RESV message. The DSCP will
   be determined from the authorized SIP message exchange between end
   systems by using the R-P header. The DCLASS object permits both
   bandwidth admission within a class and the building up of the various
   rates or token buckets.

2.3.5 Admission policy

   RSVP's basic admission policy, as defined, is to grant any user
   bandwidth if there is bandwidth available within the current
   configuration. In other words, if a new request arrives and the
   difference between the configured upper bound and the currently
   reserved bandwidth is sufficiently large, RSVP grants use of that
   bandwidth. This basic policy may be augmented in various ways, such
   as using a local or remote policy engine to apply AAA procedures and
   further qualify the reservation.

2.3.5.1 Admission for variable rate codecs

   For certain applications, such as broadcast video using MPEG-1 or
   voice without activity detection and using a constant bit rate codec
   such as G.711, this basic policy is adequate apart from AAA. For
   variable rate codecs, such as MPEG-4 or a voice codec with Voice
   Activity Detection, however, this may be deemed too conservative. In
   such cases, two basic types of statistical policy have been studied
   and reported on in the literature: simple overprovisioning, and
   approximation to ambient load.

   Simple overprovisioning sets the bandwidth admission limit higher
   than the desired load, on the assumption that a session that admits a
   certain bandwidth will in fact use a fraction of the bandwidth. For
   example, if MPEG-4 data streams are known to use data rates between
   80 and 800 KBPS and there is no obvious reason that sessions would
   synchronize (such as having commercial breaks on 15 minute
   boundaries), one could imagine estimating that the average session
   consumes 400 KBPS and treating an admission of 800 KBPS as actually
   consuming half the amount.

   One can also approximate to average load, which is perhaps a more
   reliable procedure. In this case, one maintains a variable which
   measures actual traffic through the admitted data's queue,
   approximating it using an exponentially weighted moving average. When
   a new reservation request arrives, if the requested rate is less than
   the difference between the configured upper bound and the current



Baker & Polk            Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                MLPP for IP                  February 2004


   value of the moving average, the reservation is accepted and the
   moving average is immediately increased by the amount of the
   reservation to ensure that the bandwidth is not promised out to
   several users simultaneously. In time, the moving average will decay
   from this guard position to an estimate of true load, which may offer
   a chance to another session to be reserved that would otherwise have
   been refused.

   Statistical reservation schemes such as these are overwhelmingly
   dependent on the correctness of their configuration and its
   appropriateness for the codecs in use. But they offer the opportunity
   to take advantage of statistical multiplexing gains that might
   otherwise be missed.

2.3.5.2 Interaction with complex admission policies, AAA, and preemption
        of bandwidth

   Policy is carried and applied as described in [RFC2753]. Figure 3
   below is the basic conceptual model for policy decisions and
   enforcement in an Int-Serv model. This model was created to provide
   ability to monitor and control reservation flows based on user
   identify, specific traffic and security requirements and conditions
   which might change for various reasons, including as a reaction to a
   disaster or emergency event involving the network or its users.

   The Network Node represents a router in the network. The Policy

   network operator. Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)(the router) is where
   the policy action is carried out. Policy decisions can be either
   locally present in the form of a Local Policy Decision Point (LPDP),
   or in a separate server on the network called the Policy Decision

   Point. The easier the instruction set of rules, the more likely this
   set can reside in the LDPD for speed of access reasons. The more
   complex the rule set, the more likely this is active on a remote
   server. The PDP will use other protocols (LDAP, SNMP, etc) to request
   information (e.g. user authentication and authorization for
   precedence level usage) to be used in creating the rule sets of
   network components. This remote PDP should also be considered where
   non-reactive policies are distributed out to the LPDPs.

   Taking the above model as a framework, [RFC2750] extends RSVP's
   concept of a simple reservation to include policy controls, including
   the concepts of Preemption [RFC3181] and Identity [RFC3182],
   specifically speaking to the usage of policies which preempt calls
   under the control of either a local or remote policy manager. The
   policy manager assigns a precedence level to the admitted data flow.
   If it admits a data flow that exceeds the available capacity of a
   system, the expectation is that the RSVP affected RSVP process will
   tear down a session among the lowest precedence sessions it has
   admitted. The RESV Error resulting from that will go to the receiver
   of the data flow, and be reported to the application (SIP or H.323).
   That application is responsible to disconnect its call, with a reason
   code of "bandwidth preemption".

2.4 Authentication and authorization of calls placed

   It will be necessary, of course, to ensure that any policy is applied
   to an authenticated user; it is the capabilities assigned to an
   authenticated user that may be considered to have been authorized for
   use in the network. For bandwidth admission, this will require the
   utilization of [RFC2747][RFC3097]. In SIP and H.323, AAA procedures
   will also be needed.

2.5 Defined User Interface

   The user interface - the chimes and tones heard by the user - should
   ideally remain the same as in the MLPP PSTN for those indications
   that are still applicable to an IP network. There should be some new
   effort generated to update the list of announcements sent to the user
   which don't necessarily apply. For example, in an end-to-end IP call,
   there is no known benefit to informing the user which Ethernet switch
   or router caused the call to fail - as is the equivalent case if a
   TDM Switch were the cause. All indications to the user, of course,
   depend on positive signals, not unreliable measures based on changing
   measurements.

4. Security Considerations

   This document outlines a networking capability composed entirely of
   existing specifications. It has significant security issues, in the
   sense that a failure of the various authentication or authorization
   procedures can cause a fundamental breakdown in communications.
   However, the issues are internal to the various component protocols,
   and are covered by their various security procedures.

   This document was developed with the knowledge and input of many
   people, far too numerous to be mentioned by name. Key contributors of
   thoughts include, however, Francois Le Faucheur, Haluk Keskiner,
   Rohan Mahy, Scott Bradner, Scott Morrison, and Subha Dhesikan. Pete
   Babendreier's review was especially useful.
