1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide many detailed reports and
   documents that their registrars require on a daily, weekly and
   monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction reports, as
   well as lists containing currently unavailable domains and current
   premium domain fees. These reports are critical for registrars'
   businesses and play an important role in accounting and operations
   processes as well as in sales and marketing activities. In the
   current set-up, registrars must download these reports from each
   registry's intranet differently according to each registry's document
   management set up.
   
   This document describes the content of a Premium Domain Fee Report
   based on the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-report-structure] and delivered
   by the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-reporting-repository].

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   specified in their uppercase forms.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Premium Domain Fee Report described in this document does not
   provide any security services.

8.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

Internet-Draft           Premium Domain Fee Report        September 2019

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Add implementation details once available.
