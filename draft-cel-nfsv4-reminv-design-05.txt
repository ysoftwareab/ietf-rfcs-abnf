        Using Remote Invalidation With RPC-Over-RDMA Transports
                    draft-cel-nfsv4-reminv-design-05

Abstract

   Remote Invalidation relieves RDMA responders of some of the burden of
   preparing memory to be accessed remotely, thus reducing the latency
   of RDMA Read and Write operations.  This document considers how to
   introduce generic support for Remote Invalidation to RPC-over-RDMA
   transport protocols.

1.  Introduction

   Like other RDMA-enabled storage protocols, RPC-over-RDMA Version One
   employs a Read-Write transfer model when using explicit RDMA
   operations to transfer data [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc5666bis].  This means
   an RPC-over-RDMA requester exposes regions of its memory to an RPC-
   over-RDMA responder.  The responder then uses RDMA Read and Write
   operations to transfer bulk data payloads.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   In preparation for a bulk data transfer, a requester asks its RNIC to
   assign a steering tag, or STag, to a region of memory containing the
   data to be moved.  At this time, access rights are granted that allow
   the RNIC to access or update that memory on behalf of a remote peer.
   This act is referred to as "memory registration."  The RNIC uses this
   STag to steer data to and from the registered memory region.

   When data transfer is complete, each STag is dissociated from its
   memory region.  This act is referred to as "memory invalidation."  It
   prevents further responder access to that memory region by revoking
   its remote access rights.  Invalidation should be done before RPC
   applications on the requester are allowed access to memory that was
   involved in an explicit RDMA operation.

   Before an RPC transaction is terminated, the requester is responsible
   for fencing memory from the responder [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc5666bis].
   That makes the completion of RPC transactions synchronous with chunk
   invalidation.  Therefore the latency of invalidation adds to the
   total execution time of the RPC transaction.

   Remote Invalidation is a mechanism by which an RDMA peer can request
   that the remote peer RNIC invalidate an STag associated with memory
   on that remote peer [RFC5042].  An RDMA consumer requests Remote
   Invalidation by posting an RDMA Send With Invalidate Work Request in
   place of an RDMA Send Work Request.  RDMA Send With Invalidate is
   similar to RDMA Send, but takes one additional argument: a single
   STag to be invalidated by the RNIC that receives the sent message.
   An RDMA Send message is transmitted with additional header
   information that conveys the STag that is to be invalidated
   [RFC5040].

   The benefit of Remote Invalidation is that an extra Work Request,
   context switch, and interrupt to perform memory invalidation are not
   required by the requester as part of handling the completion of an
   RPC transaction.  STag invalidation begins before the Receive
   completes, thus invalidation is started (and completes) sooner.  The
   upshot is faster completion of RPC transactions that involve
   registered memory.

   This mechanism has the most impact when explicit RDMA operations are
   needed to move moderate amounts of data.  Invalidation latency is
   quite small compared to the time it takes to convey a large payload
   with an explicit RDMA operation.  Small RPCs are already conveyed
   entirely via RDMA Send, thus Remote Invalidation is unnecessary for
   them.  When the time it takes to invalidate a memory region is on the
   same order as the time it takes to move the contents of that region,
   Remote Invalidation has its greatest impact.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   Remote Invalidation confers benefits similar to the benefits of
   increasing the size of Send and Receive buffers.  However, Remote
   Invalidation does not incur the cost of maintaining a pool of large
   Receive buffers on either the requester or responder.  Moderate-sized
   RPC payloads can be transferred without the usual costs of memory
   registration.  Requesters can rely on RDMA Write to structure their
   Receive buffers without introducing additional latency.

   There are some downsides, however.  Remote Invalidation is not
   available on all RNIC devices.  And, Remote Invalidation does not
   address the extra round trip latency incurred when using RDMA Read.
   This extra latency can be eliminated using a large inline threshold
   for transmitting RPC Calls.

   The purpose of this document is to explore generally how Remote
   Invalidation can be introduced into the RPC-over-RDMA transport
   protocol.  The primary design considerations for the transport
   protocol are to provide a mechanism to indicate when Remote
   Invalidation can be used by the transport, and to provide selection
   criteria for choosing which STag to invalidate remotely.  Elements of
   the XDR definition of the RPC-over-RDMA protocol must be altered to
   some degree, depending on desired flexibility of operation,
   invasiveness of XDR changes, and broadness of hardware support.

2.  General Requirements

2.1.  Memory Management Extensions

   Remote Invalidation was not available in the original RDMA Verbs API.
   New verbs API objects were specified that include operations that
   enable Remote Invalidation, now described in [IB].  The Verbs API
   provides a capabilities flag, MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS, that indicates that
   an RNIC can provide the new APIs and objects.

   An STag that is registered using the FRWR mechanism (in a privileged
   execution context), or is registered via a Memory Window (in user
   space), may be invalidated remotely [RFC5040].  These mechanisms are
   available when an RNIC supports MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS.

   RDMA Send With Invalidate is available only with MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS.

2.2.  Registration Types

   For the purposes of this discussion, there are two classes of STags.
   Dynamically-registered STags are used in a single RPC, then
   invalidated.  Persistently-registered STags live longer than one RPC.
   They may persist for the life of an RPC-over-RDMA connection, or
   longer.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   In RPC-over-RDMA Version One, a requester may provide more than one
   STag in the chunk lists of an RPC.  It may provide any combination of
   the following registration types in one RPC, any combination of these
   in a series of RPCs on the same connection, or it may use some other
   registration model.

   Examples of persistently-registered STags include:

   o  The device's reserved DMA R_key

   o  An STag registered for a connection that doesn't change from RPC
      to RPC (for a utility buffer, say)

   o  An STag registered for a fixed memory region that is updated after
      each time it is advertised

   o  An STag covering a large single region that is utilized in small
      segments by many RPCs

   Examples of dynamically-registered STags include:

   o  An STag registered for a single RPC transaction using a legacy
      registration mechanism, then invalidated when the RPC is retired

   o  An STag registered for a single RPC transaction using either
      Memory Windows or FRWR, then invalidated when the RPC is retired

   Among these examples, only dynamically-registered STags using Memory
   Windows or FRWR may be invalidated remotely.

2.3.  Selecting STags To Invalidate Remotely

   Remote Invalidation protocol mechanisms come in different styles:

   Fixed Protocol
      The rules by which a responder selects which STag to invalidate
      remotely is fixed in the protocol specification.

   Responder's Choice
      The responder chooses an STag to invalidate remotely from among
      all the STags in incoming requests.

   Requester's Choice
      The requester chooses one or more STags that may be invalidated
      remotely, indicating its choices in each request.  The responder
      chooses an STag to invalidate remotely from among the requester's
      picks.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   There is no RDMA layer mechanism by which a responder can determine
   how a requester-provided STag was registered.  Thus a requester that
   mixes persistently- and dynamically-registered STags in one RPC, or
   mixes them across RPCs on the same connection, cannot tolerate
   Responder's Choice.

2.4.  Future Enhancements

   There are two related enhancements that further reduce the effort
   needed to invalidate STags associated with complex RPCs:

   o  The ability for one registered STag to represent a list of memory
      regions that are not contiguous

   o  The ability to specify more than one remote STag in a single Work
      Request to be remotely invalidated

   At this time, the first mechanism has been implemented in at least
   one RNIC on the market.  The second is speculative (i.e., has not yet
   been implemented anywhere).

   Given support for registering non-contiguous memory regions with one
   STag, when an RPC-over-RDMA requester constructs an RPC that has both
   a Read list and a Write list, the requester has a choice:

   o  The requester can register a separate STag for each access mode
      (one STag for memory regions needing read access, and one STag for
      those needing write access) to provide good data security

   o  The requester can register a single STag with read and write
      access enabled for the whole set of memory regions, to allow RDMA
      Send With Invalidate to work optimally

   Having the ability to remotely invalidate multiple STags at once
   enables the combination of optimal performance and optimal security.

3.  Remote Invalidation In Operation

   When requester memory is registered for remote access, an RPC-over-
   RDMA implementation can use Remote Invalidation by following these
   steps:

   1.  The requester DMA-maps a memory region that will participate in
       an RPC transaction, then registers an STag for that region.

   2.  The requester transmits the RPC Call, which also conveys the
       STag, to the responder.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   3.  The responder processes the RPC transaction.  The peer RNICs use
       the STag to move RPC arguments and/or results.

   4.  The responder transmits the RPC Reply using an RDMA Send With
       Invalidate Work Request, setting the Work Request's inv_handle
       field to the value of the STag.

   5.  A Receive Work Request completes on the requester, carrying this
       RPC reply, and reporting the invalidated STag.

   6.  The requester skips invalidation of the STag, then DMA-unmaps the
       memory region associated with the STag.

   The requester no longer needs to invalidate the STag involved with
   this RPC.  However, there are additional details that must be
   resolved before the use of Remote Invalidation can commence.

3.1.  Determining Remote Invalidation Support Status

   An RDMA consumer (an Upper Layer Protocol implementation) that does
   not support Remote Invalidation might not tolerate the use of RDMA
   Send With Invalidate by a responder.  Such a requester performs Local
   Invalidation on STags that already happen to be invalid, and in some
   cases this can result in protection errors or other issues.

   Thus, to avoid spurious connection termination, a responder must not
   post an RDMA Send With Invalidate Work Request unless it is sure the
   following three conditions are met:

   o  The requester's RNIC is prepared to receive the additional header
      information associated with Remote Invalidation

   o  The requester has used an appropriate registration mechanism to
      register STags it wants invalidated remotely

   o  The requester is prepared to recognize remotely invalidated STags
      during Receive processing, and thus avoid invalidating them a
      second time

   When all three of these conditions are true, a requester can report
   positive Remote Invalidation support status to responders using an
   Upper Layer Protocol mechanism.  When a responder does not know the
   requester's Remote Invalidation support status, it cannot use Remote
   Invalidation without endangering the connection.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


3.2.  Selection Of Which STag To Invalidate Remotely

   The RDMA Send With Invalidate Work Request invalidates only one STag.
   RPC-over-RDMA requesters may register more than one STag to handle
   the movement of payloads for a single RPC.  Either the client will
   have to specify which STag may be remotely invalidated, the protocol
   will have to specify a fixed way to select which STag to invalidate,
   or the responder will have to choose arbitrarily which STag to
   remotely invalidate.

   In some circumstances, requesters may wish to utilize STags during
   transactions that are registered using a mechanism that does not
   tolerate Remote Invalidation.  For example, an STag that is the
   requester's local DMA R_key should never be invalidated remotely.  If
   a responder attempts to invalidate a such an STag, the result is
   undefined, but the connection may be terminated or other failures can
   occur.

   Even with Remote Invalidation enabled, requesters remain responsible
   for ensuring all STags are invalid before RPC transactions complete.
   To avoid leaving STags registered, a requester must be prepared for
   the responder or the requester's own RNIC to have not invalidated any
   of an RPC's STags.  When there are multiple STags associated with a
   single RPC, a requester must be prepared for any of the STags to have
   been remotely invalidated, or none of them.

3.3.  Reverse-Direction Operation

   As of this writing, no current RPC-over-RDMA implementation supports
   direct data placement in the reverse direction.  However, existing
   protocol specifications do not forbid it [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc5666bis]
   [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rpcrdma-bidirection]
   [I-D.cel-nfsv4-rpcrdma-version-two].

   When chunks are present in a reverse-direction RPC request, Remote
   Invalidation allows the responder to trigger invalidation of a
   requester's STags as part of sending a reply, the same as in the
   forward direction.

   However, in the reverse direction, the server acts as the requester,
   and the client is the responder.  The server's RNIC, therefore, must
   support receiving an IETH, and the server must have registered the
   STags with an appropriate registration mechanism.  Thus the server
   must indicate its Remote Invalidation support status to the client
   (the opposite of forward direction Remote Invalidation).

4.  Protocol Elements

   In this section, a number of abstract protocol variations are
   considered.  These vary in functionality and invasiveness.  Some may
   be appropriate to use in combination.

4.1.  Per Protocol Version Remote Invalidation

4.1.1.  Description

   When a higher protocol version number is negotiated, Remote
   Invalidation is always enabled.  This new protocol version would then
   be usable only with RNICs that support Remote Invalidation.  Both
   peers assume that Remote Invalidation may be used in either
   direction.

4.1.2.  Similar Existing Implementations

   SMB Direct [MS-SMBD]

4.1.3.  Advantages

   No XDR changes or protocol extensions are required.

   Reverse direction use of Remote Invalidation is automatically
   supported.

4.1.4.  Disadvantages

   The requester is not in control of which STags in an RPC may be
   invalidated.  Thus, a requester must not advertise STags which must
   never be invalidated, or the protocol must specify a fixed choice of
   which STag(s) in each request are allowed to be invalidated remotely.

   Other features and benefits of the new protocol version would not be
   available when an implementation employs an RNIC that does not
   support Remote Invalidation.  In particular, RNICs that do not
   support MEM_MGT_EXTENTIONS could not use the new protocol version.

   An extension or addition protocol version bump is required to
   indicate support for transport-level mechanisms that can invalidate
   multiple STags at once.

4.2.  Per Connection Remote Invalidation

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


4.2.1.  Description

   At connection initiation time, messages are exchanged that indicate
   each peer's Remote Invalidation support status.  Without these
   messages, peers assume Remote Invalidation is not supported.

4.2.2.  Similar Existing Implementations

   iSER [RFC7145].  Information is exchanged in RDMA-CM connection
   requests to report an implementation's Remote Invalidation support
   status.

4.2.3.  Advantages

   No changes to the base protocol XDR are required.

4.2.4.  Disadvantages

   Out-of-band messages are required to establish Remote Invalidation
   support status.

   The requester is not in control of which STags in an RPC may be
   invalidated.  Thus, a requester must not advertise STags which must
   never be invalidated.

   To support reverse-direction operation, the server must separately
   indicate that it supports Remote Invalidation.

   To enable support for multiple STag invalidation, this negotiation
   protocol would have to be extended again to indicate when mechanisms
   other than RDMA Send With Invalidate are supported by the requester's
   RNIC.

4.3.  Fixed Protocol Remote Invalidation

4.3.1.  Description

   No new field is introduced to the transport header.  Protocol
   specification determines how the responder chooses which STag is to
   be invalidated remotely.  Some other means is used to determine
   whether Remote Invalidation can be used or not.

4.3.2.  Similar Existing Implementations

   iSER [RFC7145].  Two STags fields appear in each request: one
   advertises Read data and one advertises Write data.  When only one
   STag is used in the request, it may be invalidated remotely.  One
   both STags are used, only the Read STag may be invalidated remotely.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   SMB Direct [MS-SMBD].  The responder always chooses the first STag in
   each request to be invalidated remotely.

4.3.3.  Advantages

   No changes to the base protocol XDR are required.

4.3.4.  Disadvantages

   Out-of-band messages are required to establish support status.

   The requester is not in control of which STags in an RPC may be
   invalidated.  Thus, a requester must not advertise STags which must
   never be invalidated.

   This mechanism may not work well for transport protocols that allow
   multiple read and write STags.

4.4.  Per RPC Remote Invalidation (Single STag)

4.4.1.  Description

   A field is added to the transport header that contains an STag which
   may be invalidated by the responder.  A special value can be chosen
   to mean "no STag may be invalidated" for use by requesters that have
   no support for Remote Invalidation.

4.4.2.  Similar Existing Implementations

   None.

4.4.3.  Advantages

   A requester may advertise STags that cannot be invalidated remotely,
   as long as they are never marked as "may invalidate."

   No out-of-band support status negotiation is needed.

   Reverse-direction RPCs can each indicate whether a reverse-direction
   requester desires or does not support Remote Invalidation.

   The responder needs no special logic or assumptions to choose the
   STag to invalidate remotely.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


4.4.4.  Disadvantages

   Either the base RPC-over-RDMA header XDR definition is altered, or a
   protocol extension is required.

   Requesters transmit a little extra data per RPC, making RPC-over-RDMA
   messages slightly more costly to send and parse.

   This mechanism cannot support the remote invalidation of multiple
   STags at once.

4.5.  Per RPC Remote Invalidation (Multiple STags)

4.5.1.  Description

   A new data structure is added to the transport header that indicate
   which STags which may be invalidated by the responder.

   This information might appear as a new field in the RDMA segment data
   structure, as each segment has its own STag field.  The field
   indicates whether or not that STag may be invalidated by the
   responder.  Perhaps that field is a boolean, though in XDR, a boolean
   is a full 32 bits.

   Or, this information could appear in the header as an array of STags,
   to reduce the amount of extra data contained in the RPC-over-RDMA
   header.  Zero array elements means the requester does not support
   Remote Invalidation.

4.5.2.  Similar Existing Implementations

   NVMe/Fabrics [NVME].  Each STag in a request has an associated bit
   flag that indicates whether the responder is allowed to invalidate it
   remotely.

4.5.3.  Advantages

   A requester may advertise STags that cannot be invalidated remotely,
   as long as they are never marked as "may invalidate."

   The mechanism allows a requester to request either invalidation of
   multiple STags at once, or to choose one STag to invalidate remotely.

   No out-of-band support status negotiation is needed.

   Each reverse-direction RPC can indicate whether a reverse-direction
   requester desires or does not support Remote Invalidation.

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   The responder needs no special logic or assumptions to choose the
   STag to invalidate remotely.

4.5.4.  Disadvantages

   The RPC-over-RDMA header XDR definition is possibly extensively
   altered.

   Requesters transmit extra data per RPC.  However, it is limited to
   only one or two 32-bit words in most cases.

4.6.  Inter-RPC Remote Invalidation

4.6.1.  Description

   As a subfeature of support for Remote Invalidation, it is possible
   that a responder can remotely invalidate an STag (using RDMA Send
   With Invalidate) that refers to registered memory being used in the
   Read chunk of a different RPC.  Such Remote Invalidation would be
   requested only after the RDMA Read has already been completed.

   This can be useful when a responder is replying to an RPC via an
   inline message, but notices there are other RPC replies pending that
   have multiple STags, some of which are Read chunks.

4.6.2.  Similar Existing Implementations

   None

4.6.3.  Advantages

   This is one way to enable remote invalidation of multiple STags per
   RPC, using only RDMA Send With Invalidate.

4.6.4.  Disadvantages

   Additional requester and responder complexity would be required to
   keep track of STags.

5.  Recommendations

5.1.  General Considerations

   When constructing a protocol to support Remote Invalidation, one of
   the above designs, or some combination of them, may be chosen.

   In no particular order, the author feels that the design priorities
   are:



Lever                  Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   o  Do not prevent the efficient operation of RNICs that do not handle
      RDMA Send With Invalidate

   o  Introduce as little impact on header XDR and header length as
      possible, to keep collateral performance impact low

   o  Enable support for Remote Invalidation when explicit RDMA is used
      in reverse-direction RPCs.

   An important question is whether the base RPC-over-RDMA protocol
   should support Remote Invalidation, whether Remote Invalidation
   support should be carried entirely on the shoulders of protocol
   extensions, or whether some combination of the two is best.

   Upper Layer Protocols will likely always be responsible for some
   degree of signaling Remote Invalidation capabilities, as long as
   innovation continues at the transport layer (e.g., new RDMA
   operations that enable multi-STag Remote Invalidation).  Predicting
   future hardware capabilities is challenging, limiting the ability to
   design long-lived protocol support for them.

   Lastly, it is difficult to estimate how long the industry must
   continue to support less capable devices.

5.2.  Analysis And Discussion

   All things being equal, making no changes to the base XDR definition
   has great appeal.  If the mechanism in Section 4.2 can be broadly
   effective at enabling Remote Invalidation in the current set of RPC-
   over-RDMA implementations, it would be the proper choice.

   Unfortunately, among current RPC-over-RDMA client implementations,
   there is one client that can immediately use a per-connection style
   protocol, and one that can use only a per-RPC style protocol such as
   Section 4.4.  A third known client resides in user space and uses FMR
   registration, thus it is incapable of immediately employing Remote
   Invalidation.

   Because there is a wide latitude of implementation choice already
   allowed by the RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol, the author's
   preference is to implement Section 4.4.  The target STag can be added
   to the RPC-over-RDMA transport as a single field in a new version of
   the RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol.  No further changes or
   extensions are needed.

   In the longer term, the requester appears to be in the better
   position to determine which STag may be invalidated remotely.  With
   this mechanism, the requester can choose based on which STags may be



Lever                  Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   invalidated remotely, or may use criteria based on the strengths of
   its RNIC.  For instance, choosing the largest registered memory
   region might be beneficial in some cases.

   Allowing the responder to select from among several choices does not
   seem to bring additional value, and burdens the responder with
   additional header parsing costs for each chunk-bearing RPC
   transaction.

   Furthermore, the ability to request Remote Invalidation of multiple
   STags in a single Work Request appears to be somewhat distant.  It
   would require additional Upper Layer Protocol mechanisms to
   distinguish the new mechanism from using RDMA Send With Invalidate,
   which we are not in a position to design today.  Thus it does not
   seem worth the extra implementation and protocol complexity of having
   the requester provide a list of STags for the responder to choose
   from.

   As an alternative to modifying the XDR definition for the RDMA_MSG
   and RDMA_NOMSG message types, a new RDMA message type could be
   introduced in a new version of RPC-over-RDMA that provides similar
   functionality to RDMA_MSG and RDMA_NOMSG but adds one or more new
   fields.  This has the advantage of leaving the Version One-compatible
   parts of the the new XDR definition unchanged.  It is an open
   question whether this introduces more complexity to existing
   implementations than adding new fields to RDMA_MSG and RDMA_NOMSG.
   However, this approach is similar to the introduction of READ_PLUS in
   the specification of NFSv4.2 [RFC7862].

   Allowing the feature described in Section 4.6 is likely to increase
   the complexity of responder and especially requester implementations,
   as they would have to remember invalidated STags independently of RPC
   completions.  Because it does not require any XDR changes, it could
   easily be enabled in a future protocol extension.  The author's
   preference is to forbid this behavior in the initial specification,
   but allow for a future extension to introduce it.

5.3.  Example Remote Invalidation Protocol

   As an example of how to proceed, the simplest approach would replace
   struct rpcrdma2_chunk_lists (as defined in
   [I-D.cel-nfsv4-rpcrdma-version-two]) with the following:









Lever                  Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      RPC-over-RDMA Remote Invalidation         March 2017


   <CODE BEGINS>

    struct rpcrdma2_chunk_lists {
        enum msg_type               rdma_direction;
        u32                         rdma_inv_handle;
        struct rpcrdma2_read_list   *rdma_reads;
        struct rpcrdma2_write_list  *rdma_writes;
        struct rpcrdma2_write_chunk *rdma_reply;
    };

   <CODE ENDS>


   The following language describes how to utilize the new field:

      The requester sets the value of the rdma_inv_handle field to the
      value of any one of the rdma_handle fields in the RPC-over-RDMA
      header of the RPC Call that may be invalidated remotely.  If the
      RPC-over-RDMA header of the RPC Call contains no rdma_handles that
      may be invalidated remotely, the requester MUST set the value of
      the rdma_inv_handle field to zero.

      If the rdma_inv_handle field in the RPC-over-RDMA header of an RPC
      Call contains zero, the responder MUST NOT use RDMA Send With
      Invalidate to transmit the matching RPC Reply.  Otherwise, the
      responder SHOULD use RDMA Send With Invalidate to transmit the RPC
      Reply, specifying the value in the RPC-over-RDMA header's
      rdma_inv_handle field as the Send With Invalidate Work Request's
      inv_rkey.

6.  Security Considerations

   Remote Invalidation metadata is conveyed in the clear in RPC-over-
   RDMA headers.  This does not expose any new information to attackers.

   A man-in-the-middle can alter Remote Invalidation metadata while it
   is in transit.  Requesters are prepared to handle the case where
   responders have not invalidated any STags associated with an RPC.  An
   attacker can cause other STags in flight to be invalidated before the
   responder is finished with the associated memory.  Or an attacker can
   replace the "to-be invalidated" STag with an STag in the same RPC
   that should not be invalidated remotely.  Any of these might cause
   loss of connection, or other failures.

   A connection relationship is required to exist between a requester
   and a responder.  The requester's RNIC has associated a Protection
   Domain with that connection.  The STag on the requester to be
   invalidated is associated with that Protection Domain.  This protects

   against arbitrary invalidation of STags by network nodes not part of
   the connection.

   Further discussion appears in [RFC5042].
