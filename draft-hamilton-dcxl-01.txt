Abstract

   The Dublin Core is a simple resource description format which arose
   out of a loose grouping of "librarians, archivists, humanities
   scholars and geographers, as well as standards makers in the
   Internet, Z39.50 and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
   communities" [1].

   This document describes a mapping from the abstract model of the
   Dublin Core to the X.500 [2], LDAP [3], and CLDAP [4] directory
   service protocols.

1. The Dublin Core in X.500, LDAP and CLDAP

   We propose that each of the thirteen elements of the Dublin Core be
   made into an X.500/[C]LDAP attribute, and that these attributes be
   gathered together in an object class:

      Name:             dcObject
      Description:      object containing the Dublin Core attributes
      OID:              lutObjectClass.1 (1.3.6.1.4.1.1828.2.1)
      SubclassOf:       top
      MustContain:
      MayContain:       dcSubject, dcDescription, dcTitle, dcAuthor,
                          dcPublisher, dcContributor, dcDate,

2. Examples and implementation considerations

   For example, using Quipu [5] EDB notation, a Dublin Core "Title"
   element which had the value "Cities of The Red Night" would be
   represented as the attribute/value pair:

     dcTitle= Cities of The Red Night



                                                                [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 June 1997


   One aspect of the Dublin Core does not translate directly to X.500
   and LDAP - each element may have additional qualifying information
   attached to it.  This gives the creator of the record a way of
   indicating additional semantics, e.g. the classification scheme being
   used in the "Subject" element.

   Since X.500 and LDAP are, like most Internet based search and
   retrieval protocols, attribute/value oriented, it is necessary to
   find a place to put this extra information.  We propose that, given
   the difficulty of incorporating this model within the X.500/LDAP
   paradigm, a simple but sub-optimal approach be taken - with any
   qualifying information being placed at the beginning of the value
   part of the attribute/value pair, delimited using round brackets, and
   with any additional qualifiers following using comma separation.

   For example, if the subject classification for the above book were
   813 in the Dewey Decimal system, the resulting Dublin Core record
   expressed as an X.500 EDB entry would look like this:

     dcSubject= (scheme=DDC) 813

3. Extensibility

   It is important to note that the Dublin Core element set is intended
   for use in describing document-like objects, and not as a means of
   describing arbitrary objects.  Furthermore, the number of elements is
   strictly limited in the interests of interoperability.

   Work is ongoing on the Warwick Framework [6], which attempts to
   provide a mechanism for packaging together collections of descriptive
   information.  It is envisaged that this would be used in cases where
   the Dublin Core element set did not provide enough descriptive
   capability.  This is a subject for further study.

4. Security considerations

   This proposal does not introduce any new security related issues.

   One of the main uses to which the Dublin Core is expected to be put
   is in the generation of author supplied cataloguing information for
   on-line resources.  Implementations which manipulate externally
   produced data should treat it with caution - for example, to avoid
   buffer overrun problems and unexpected evaluation of metacharacters.

5. Conclusions

   This document has shown how the X.500 protocol, and the related LDAP
   and CLDAP protocols, may be used as carriers for the abstract



                                                                [Page 5]

   resource descriptions of the Dublin Core proposal.

   It should be apparent that a little care is necessary when delivering
   this information via these protocols, but that this does not imply
   any great additional implementation complexity.
