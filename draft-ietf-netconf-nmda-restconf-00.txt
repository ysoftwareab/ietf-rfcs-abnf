1.  Introduction

   This document updates RESTCONF [RFC8040] in order to support the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   The solution presented in this document is backwards compatible with
   [RFC8040].  This is achieved by it only adding new top-level
   resources, and thereby leaving the semantics of all existing
   resources alone.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Summary of Updates to RFC 8040

   This document updates [RFC8040] in the following ways:

   o  Adds new top-level resource "/ds".

   o  Adds new query parameter "with-origin".

   o  Section 3.5.4, Paragraph 3 doesn't apply for <operational>.

4.  Conformance

   A RESTCONF server identifies that it supports NMDA both by supporting
   the <operational> datastore, as well as by supporting at least
   revision YANG_LIBRARY_REVISION of the "ietf-yang-library" module, as
   specified in [I-D.nmdsdt-netconf-rfc7895bis].

   RESTCONF clients MAY test if a server supports NMDA using the HEAD
   method on the <operational> datastore resource, described later in
   this document.

   RESTCONF clients MAY also test if a server supports the NMDA using
   either the HEAD or GET methods on "ietf-yang-library:yang-library"
   resource, under either {+restconf}/data or <operational>, though only
   the latter resource SHOULD be used so that the client doesn't need to
   have any ongoing need to use the {+restconf}/data resource.

   RESTCONF clients MAY also test if a server supports the NMDA by
   checking the revision number for the "ietf-yang-library" module
   listed under "ietf-yang-library:modules-state", under either
   {+restconf}/data or <operational>.  This approach might be preferred
   by some existing clients, but new clients should avoid using the
   deprecated "modules-state" resource.

5.  The {+restconf}/ds/<datastore> Resource

   Knowing which datastores a server supports, from querying the ietf-
   yang-library module, a RESTCONF client interacts with specific
   datastores using the resource path template:

     {+restconf}/ds/<datastore>

   Where <datastore> is encoded as an "identity".  For instance:

     {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:running
     {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:intended
     {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:operational
     {+restconf}/ds/example-ds-ephemeral:ds-ephemeral

6.  Protocol Operations

   All existing protocol operations defined in [RFC8040] for the
   {+restconf}/data resource are available for all of the new datastore
   resources with the following exceptions:

   o  Dynamic datastores are excluded, as each dynamic datastore
      definition needs to be reviewed for what protocol operations it
      supports.

   o  Some datastores are read-only by nature (e.g., <intended>), and
      hence any attempt to modify these datastores will fail.

   o  RFC 8040, Section 3.5.4, Paragraph 3 does not apply when
      interacting with <operational>.

   o  New boolean query parameter "with-origin" (default: false) is
      defined to request the "origin" attributes when querying
      <operational>.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD

8.  IANA Considerations
