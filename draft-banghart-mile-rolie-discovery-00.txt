                       ROLIE Discovery Mechanism
                 draft-banghart-mile-rolie-discovery-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism that allows consistent discovery
   of ROLIE repositories.  This discovery is extremely important for
   automated tools that cannot use out-of-band Service Document
   discovery.  Any human operators are also able to use this mechanism
   to avoid relying on inconsistent human to human communication.  This
   document updates the ROLIE core specification.

1.  Introduction

   Discovery of a top-level resource is an important part of any RESTful
   service.  In order to begin navigating the web of information
   available in ROLIE [RFC8322], a client must first locate the Service
   Document.  Without a well-defined discovery mechanism, clients must
   use out-of-band methods to locate the Service Document, such as
   crawling a web page or directly contacting website administrators.

   The following goals are laid out for this mechanism:

      Only requires domain name as input to locate an exact URL for
      Service Document retrieval.

      Fully automatable, but usable by human operators.

      Supports multi-tenancy, that is, multiple ROLIE services hosted on
      the same domain.

   In order to meet these goals , this document updates ROLIE to require
   the implementation of DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763].

   DNS-SD provides a standardized mechanism built on top of existing DNS
   processes that would allow for ROLIE clients to automatically
   discover ROLIE services provided on a domain.  DNS-SD is relatively
   simple to understand and implement, and as it only uses existing
   fields in DNS Zone Files, does not require any additional
   implementation work by the DNS server.

   The rest of the document assumes that the reader has a basic
   understanding of both DNS-SD, and traditional DNS configuration,
   including zone files.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  XML-related Conventions

   Needed?  Todo.

4.  Requirements for Use of DNS Service Discovery

   A ROLIE service MUST be registered to the relevant DNS Server using
   the conventions and requirements laid out in DNS-SD ([RFC6763].

   A ROLIE service MUST use the service name "rolie" as registered to
   the Service Names and Port Numbers registry.

   TODO: Define a standarized composite service name (i.e.
   _rolie_https._tcp)

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new entry in the Service Name and Port
   Number Registry at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-
   port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml>.  The registration
   request is as follows:
