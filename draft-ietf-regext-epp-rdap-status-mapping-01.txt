  Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) and Registration Data Access
                     Protocol (RDAP) Status Mapping
              draft-ietf-regext-epp-rdap-status-mapping-01

Abstract

   This document describes the mapping of the Extensible Provisioning
   Protocol (EPP) statuses with the statuses registered for use in the
   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).  This document identifies
   gaps in the mapping, and registers RDAP statuses to fill the gaps to
   ensure that all of the EPP RFC statuses are supported in RDAP.

1.  Introduction

   This document maps the statuses defined in the Extensible
   Provisioning Protocol (EPP) RFCs to the list of statuses registered
   for use in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), in the RDAP
   JSON Values Registry [rdap-json-values].

   The RDAP JSON Values Registry is described in section 10.2 of
   [RFC7483] and is available in the RDAP JSON Values Registry
   [rdap-json-values].

   The EPP statuses used as the source of the mapping include section
   2.3 of the EPP Domain Name Mapping [RFC5731], section 2.3 of the EPP
   Host Mapping [RFC5732], section 2.2 of the EPP Contact Mapping
   [RFC5733], and section 3.1 of EPP Grace Period Mapping [RFC3915].

   Each EPP status MUST map to a single RDAP status to ensure that data
   in the Domain Name Registries (DNRs) that use EPP can be accurately
   presented in RDAP.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  EPP to RDAP Status Mapping

   Below is an alphabetically sorted list of EPP statuses from the EPP
   RFCs ([RFC5731], [RFC5732], [RFC5733], and [RFC3915]) mapped to the
   RDAP statuses registered in the RDAP JSON Values Registry
   [rdap-json-values], with the format <EPP Status> '=' <RDAP Status>,
   where a blank <RDAP Status> indicates a gap in the mapping.

      addPeriod =
      autoRenewPeriod =
      clientDeleteProhibited =
      clientHold =
      clientRenewProhibited =
      clientTransferProhibited =
      clientUpdateProhibited =
      inactive = inactive
      linked = associated
      ok = active
      pendingCreate = pending create
      pendingDelete = pending delete
      pendingRenew = pending renew
      pendingRestore =
      pendingTransfer = pending transfer
      pendingUpdate = pending update
      redemptionPeriod =
      renewPeriod =
      serverDeleteProhibited =
      serverRenewProhibited =
      serverTransferProhibited =
      serverUpdateProhibited =
      serverHold =
      transferPeriod =

   The RDAP JSON Values Registry [rdap-json-values] does have a set of
   prohibited statuses including "renew prohibited", "update
   prohibited", "transfer prohibited", and "delete prohibited", but
   these statuses do not directly map to the EPP prohibited statuses.
   The EPP prohibited statuses reflect both what is prohibited ("renew",
   "update", "transfer", "delete") and who set ("client" or "server")
   and can clear the status.  In the DNR, the client and server
   prohibited statuses are separate and RDAP MUST support the same
   separation.

   Each of the EPP status values that don't map directly to an RDAP
   status value is described below.  Each EPP status value includes a
   proposed new RDAP status value and a description of the value.  The
   RDAP status value is derived from the EPP status value by converting

   the EPP camel case representation to lower case with a space
   character inserted between word boundaries.

   addPeriod = add period;  For DNR that indicates if the object is
       deleted by the registrar during this period, the registry
       provides a credit to the registrar for the cost of the
       registration.
   autoRenewPeriod = auto renew period;  For DNR that indicates if the
       object is deleted by the registrar during this period, the
       registry provides a credit to the registrar for the cost of the
       auto renewal.
   clientDeleteProhibited = client delete prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the client requested that requests to delete the object
       MUST be rejected.
   clientHold = client hold;  For DNR that indicates the client
       requested that the DNS delegation information MUST NOT be
       published for the object.
   clientRenewProhibited = client renew prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the client requested that requests to renew the object
       MUST be rejected.
   clientTransferProhibited = client transfer prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the client requested that requests to transfer the
       object MUST be rejected.
   clientUpdateProhibited = client update prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the client requested that requests to update the object
       (other than to remove this status) MUST be rejected.
   pendingRestore = pending restore;  For DNR that indicates a object is
       in the process of being restored after being in the
       redemptionPeriod state.
   redemptionPeriod = redemption period;  For DNR that indicates a
       delete has been received, but the object has not yet been purged
       because an opportunity exists to restore the object and abort the
       deletion process.
   renewPeriod = renew period;  For DNR that indicates if the object is
       deleted by the registrar during this period, the registry
       provides a credit to the registrar for the cost of the renewal.
   serverDeleteProhibited = server delete prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the server set the status so that requests to delete
       the object MUST be rejected.
   serverRenewProhibited = server renew prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the server set the status so that requests to renew the
       object MUST be rejected.
   serverTransferProhibited = server transfer prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the server set the status so that requests to transfer
       the object MUST be rejected.
   serverUpdateProhibited = server update prohibited;  For DNR that
       indicates the server set the status so that requests to update
       the object (other than to remove this status) MUST be rejected.

   serverHold = server hold;  For DNR that indicates the server set the
       status so that DNS delegation information MUST NOT be published
       for the object.
   transferPeriod = transfer period;  For DNR that indicates if the
       domain name is deleted by the registrar during this period, the
       registry provides a credit to the registrar for the cost of the
       transfer.

   The resulting mapping after registering the new RDAP statuses is:

      addPeriod = add period
      autoRenewPeriod = auto renew period
      clientDeleteProhibited = client delete prohibited
      clientHold = client hold
      clientRenewProhibited = client renew prohibited
      clientTransferProhibited = client transfer prohibited
      clientUpdateProhibited = client update prohibited
      inactive = inactive
      linked = associated
      ok = active
      pendingCreate = pending create
      pendingDelete = pending delete
      pendingRenew = pending renew
      pendingRestore = pending restore
      pendingTransfer = pending transfer
      pendingUpdate = pending update
      redemptionPeriod = redemption period
      renewPeriod = renew period
      serverDeleteProhibited = server delete prohibited
      serverRenewProhibited = server renew prohibited
      serverTransferProhibited = server transfer prohibited
      serverUpdateProhibited = server update prohibited
      serverHold = server hold
      transferPeriod = transfer period

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  JSON Values Registry

   The following values should be registered by the IANA in the RDAP
   JSON Values Registry described in [RFC7483]:

   Value: add period

   Type: status

4.  Security Considerations

   The status values described in this document can be subject to
   server-side information disclosure policies that restrict display of
   the values to authorized clients.  Implementers may wish to review
   [RFC7481] for a description of the RDAP security services that can be
   used to implement information disclosure policies.
