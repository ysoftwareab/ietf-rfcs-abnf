Abstract

    This memo defines a method for limiting the flooding of OSPF LSAs to
    a configurable subset of the network topology.  The following OSPF
    properties are maintained: (1) routers are omitted from the routing
    calculation until their link-state databases are synchronized and
    (2) links must be bidirectional before they can be used in the
    calculation. Backward-compatibility with unmodified OSPF routers is
    also provided.

1.  Overview

    Standard OSPF floods its LSAs over all links. This flooding logic is
    simple, robust, and auto-configuring. However, in highly meshed
    environments when many routers have a large number of neighbors,
    this flooding can be a burden on the router's processing power.

    For that reason, this memo suggests restricting flooding to a
    configured set of links. For backward-compatibility, and to enable
    the network operator to restore control connectivity from any
    location, a link is used for flooding if configured as such in
    *either* end. To prevent a link to be used for flooding, we use the
    technique from [Ref3], preventing its neighbor relationships from
    advancing past 2-way state.

    These neighbor relationships that were artificially stopped at 2-way
    state, but would have advanced to Full state if Section 10.4 of
    [Ref1] were followed, are termed "forwarding adjacencies". We do not
    change the building of router-LSAs and network-LSAs, and instead
    report these forwarding adjacencies in a new set of LSAs, called
    router-addition-LSAs and network-addition-LSAs.

    The standard OSPF routing calculation is then extended on an area-
    by-area basis to include the forwarding adjacencies, but only if
    both (a) all routers in the area support this memo and (b) both ends
    of the forwarding adjacency are reachable via the standard OSPF
    routing calculation.

2.  Mechanisms

    The descriptions of the required enhancements is split into the
    following sections. Section 2.1 describes how we prevent flooding on
    certain links by preventing their neighbor relationships from
    advancing past state 2-Way. These non-flooding relationships, called
    "forwarding adjacencies", are advertised in new LSAs as described in
    Section 2.2. Section 2.3 describes how these new LSAs are used in
    the routing calculation. The use of forwarding adjacencies requires
    that we perform the MTU check in the OSPF Hello protocol, as Section
    2.4 explains.

    2.1.  Deciding to become adjacent

	OSPF floods only to neighbors is state Exchange or greater. So
	we prevent flooding on a link by preventing the neighbor
	relationships on the link from advancing past 2-way, exactly as
	was done in [Ref3].

	In particular, if Section 10.4 of [Ref1] indicates that the
	router should form an adjacency with a neighbor (transitioning
	the neighbor from 2-Way to ExStart state), the router should
	execute additional steps as follows:

	(1) If the interface type is Virtual Link, start forming the
	    adjacency (we don't allow you to disable flooding over
	    virtual links).

	(2) If the neighbor is asking to form an adjacency (that is,
	    we're running the logic in Section 10.4 of [Ref1] because we
	    have received a Database Description packet from the
	    neighbor), start forming the adjacency. This is necessary
	    for backward compatibility.

	(3) Otherwise, we're running Section 10.4 of [Ref1] because
	    either (i) we've just received a bidirectional Hello from
	    the neighbor, (ii) there was an error in the previous
	    Database Exchange over this link or (iii) an adjacency over
	    an equivalent link has been lost (see Section 2.2). In this
	    case, start forming the adjacency by transitioning the
	    neighbor state to ExStart *only* if you have been configured
	    to do so.

    2.2.  LSA origination

	A router implementing the enhancements in this memo sets the FA
	bit it its router-LSA's type field (Section A.1), and advertises
	its forwarding adjacencies in router-addition-LSAs and network-



Moy								[Page 3]

Internet Draft		  OSPF Subset Flooding		   February 2001


	addition-LSAs.

	2.2.1.	Advertising forwarding adjacencies

	    Forwarding adjacencies, those bidirectional neighbors
	    (neighbor state 2-Way) that would have been advertised in
	    router-LSAs and network-LSAs had the router been configured
	    to flood over them, are advertised instead in router-
	    addition-LSAs and network-addition-LSAs.

	    The way a forwarding adjacency is advertised depends upon
	    its associated interface type and the role that the router
	    is playing on the associated segment.

	    o	Neighbors that have been stopped at 2-Way state on
		point-to-point and point-to-multipoint interfaces are
		added to router-addition-LSAs as Type 1 links (point-to-
		point connection to another router), formatted according
		to Sections 12.4.1.1 and 12.4.1.4 of [Ref1].

	    o	If the router is attached to a broadcast or NBMA
		segment, is not the DR, and its conversation with the DR
		has been limited to state 2Way, a Type 2 link
		(connection to a transit network) is added to a router-
		addition-LSA.

	    o	If the router is the DR on an attached broadcast or NBMA
		segment, neighbor conversations that have been limited
		to state 2Way are added to network-addition-LSAs.

    2.3.  Modified routing calculation

	If all the router-LSAs in Area A's link-state database have the
	FA bit (Section A.1) set in their rtype field, then the OSPF
	routing calculation for Area A is modified as follows.

	 (1)   The intra-area calculation for Area A, Section 16.1 of
	       [Ref1], is run to determine which routers are reachable
	       in Area A.

	 (2)   The intra-area calculation is then rerun. However, this
	       time when Section 16.1 of [Ref1] examines the router-LSA
	       for router X, you must examine both the router-LSA
	       originated by X *and* all the router-addition-LSAs that
	       it has originated. Likewise, when 16.1 of [Ref1] examines
	       network-LSAs for network N (defined by its Designated
	       Router's address), you must examine the network-LSA and
	       also all matching network-addition-LSAs. For the



Moy								[Page 4]

Internet Draft		  OSPF Subset Flooding		   February 2001


	       forwarding adjacencies listed in router-addition-LSAs and
	       network-addition-LSAs, we substitute a different check
	       for the bidirectional check in Step 2b of Section 16.1 of
	       [Ref1]. In order to use a forwarding adjacency in the
	       routing calculation, both router endpoints must have been
	       found to be reachable.

    2.4.  MTU check

	Links that are not used by the OSPF Database Exchange process
	are now included in the routing calculation. However, we still
	want links with MTU mismatches to be excluded from the routing
	calculation. For this reason we implement the MTU mismatch
	detection in OSPF's Hello Protocol, exactly as was specified in
	Section 2.4 of [Ref3].	This logic prevents links with MTU
	mismatches from being declared bidirectional.  See Section G.9
	of [Ref3] for more details on MTU mismatches.

3.  Backward compatibility

    If the router's neighbor requests to form a full adjacency, by
    sending a Database Description packet, the router must comply as
    long as a full adjacency is warranted according to Section 10.4 of
    [Ref1}, and is the same backward-compatibility mechanism used by
    [Ref3].

    Also, all routers within an OSPF area need to be capable of
    including forwarding adjacencies (advertised in router-additions-
    LSAs and network-additions-LSAs) in their routing calculations
    before any router in the area is allowed to. This is determined by
    checking to see that all router-LSAs in the area's link-state
    database have the FA-bit set.

4.  Notes

    Note the following concerning the enhancements proposed by this
    memo.

    o	We do not recommend any particular configuration syntax. A
	vendor may decide to let you configure over which links to
	flood, or configure over which links not to flood. Or the vendor
	could combine with the functionality of [Ref3], and configure
	the Router IDs of the neighbors with which to flood (or not to
	flood).

    o	In the future, the routers may themselves choose which links to
	use in flooding, For example, if a distributed, stable algorithm
	were developed which produced a 2-connected spanning graph, that



Moy								[Page 5]

Internet Draft		  OSPF Subset Flooding		   February 2001


	might be used to autoconfigure the flooding links.

    o	If insufficient links are configured from flooding, some routers
	may become isolated from the flooding algorithm, and hence from
	the routing calculation. However, since a link's flooding
	participation need only be configured in one endpoint, and
	operator would be able to reconfigure flooding and fix the
	problem remotely.

    o	Two Dijkstra calculations are employed by the enhanced routing
	calculation of this memo, the first to determine router
	reachability, and the second to include the forwarding
	adjacencies. However, since the first only deals with
	reachability, one does not need to perform its sorting phase.

A. New LSA formats

    This memo requires that the router set an additional bit in it's
    router-LSA's rtype field (Section A.1) and that the router be
    capable of originating and processing two new LSAs, the router-
    additions-LSA (Section A.2) and the network-additions-LSA (Section
    A.2).

A.1 Router-LSA: rtype field

    The format and building of the OSPF router-LSA remains unchanged,
    reflecting the router's full adjacencies (neighbor state Full) as
    specified in Section 12.4.1 of [Ref1]. However, a new flag, called
    bit FA, is added to the rtype field of the router-LSA. A router sets
    this bit if and only if it is capable of using the new router-
    additions-LSAs and network-additions-LSAs in its routing
    calculations. Equivalently, bit FA is set when the router is capable
    of using forwarding adjacencies in the routing calculation.	 Setting
    bit FA also implies that the router is capable of handling Opaque-
    LSAs, as specified in [Ref2].

A.2 Router-additions-LSA

    The router-additions-LSA is an area-scoped Opaque-LSA, having Opaque
    Type equal to TBD1. It is used to advertise forwarding adjacencies,
    and uses the same format as the router-LSA. The router's collection
    of forwarding adjacencies can be listed in one or more router-
    additions-LSAs, with the Opaque ID field used to distinguish the
    LSAs. Rules for building the router-additions-LSA are described in
    Section 2.2.1 above.

    The format of the router-additions-LSA is identical to the router-
    LSA, except for the following differences:

    o	Multiple router-addition-LSAs can be originated, distinguished
	by Opaque ID. The value of Opaque ID can be arbitrary. Note the
	similarity to the OSPF for IPv6 router-LSA [Ref5].

A.3 Network-additions-LSA

    The network-additions-LSA is an area-scoped Opaque-LSA, having
    Opaque Type equal to TBD2. It is used by the Designated Router on a
    broadcast or NBMA segment to advertise its forwarding adjacencies on
    the segment, and uses a similar format to the network-LSA. The
    router's collection of forwarding adjacencies can be listed in one
    or more network-additions-LSAs, with the Opaque ID field used to
    distinguish the LSAs. Rules for building the network-additions-LSA
    are described in Section 2.2.1 above.

    The format of the network-additions-LSA is identical to the network-
    LSA, except for the following differences:

    o	The IP address of the network segment is included in the body of
	the network-additions-LSA, in the "Network Address" field. As in
	standard OSPF, this is the IP address of the segment's
	Designated Router.

    o	Multiple network-addition-LSAs can be originated, distinguished
	by Opaque ID. The value of Opaque ID can be arbitrary.
