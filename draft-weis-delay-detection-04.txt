                     IPsec Delivery Delay Detection
                     draft-weis-delay-detection-04

Abstract

   This memo describes a one-way measurement of an IPsec packet edge-to-
   edge delay.  Delay detection is enabled by a sender of an IPsec
   packet that includes a timestamp declaring the time at which it was
   sent.  The receiver of the datagram can then judge how recently it
   was sent and choose a policy action, which could include discarding
   packets deemed to be 'too old' (having a timestamp too far into the
   past) or 'too new' (having a timestamp that is too far into the
   future).  This provides a freshness policy check, which can be
   valuable irrespective of whether the IPsec policy also includes
   replay protection.

1.  Introduction

   IP datagrams, including those protected by an IP Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] or IP Authentication Header
   [RFC4302], can be delayed in transit.  In some use cases a delayed
   packet is considered invalid, or "not fresh".  A fresh datagram is
   defined as one "Recently generated; not replayed from some earlier
   interaction of the protocol."  [RFC4949].  An intentional delay of a
   packet can be considered an attack, for example if the protected
   datagrams contain time sensitive data.

   When delay detection is combined with IPsec replay protection,
   packets are guaranteed to be fully fresh (i.e, both recently
   generated and not replayed).  However, some applications of IPsec
   cannot enable replay protection.  For example, Many-to-Many
   Applications [RFC3170] often require the use of multi-sender security
   associations, where receivers cannot enable IPsec replay protection.
   This is because a single counter cannot record responses from
   multiple senders, and no provision is made for multiple counters in
   the security association.  Many-to-Many Applications can include

   routing protocols (e.g., OSPF [RFC4552] and PIM [RFC7761]) deployed
   between a set of routers.  These applications can benefit from the
   partial freshness property of "recently generated".  This is
   particularly useful when the application traffic provides its own
   replay protection.

   This memo describes an IPsec Delivery Delay Detection Protocol (D3P)
   using timestamps to declare the age of an IP datagram, enabling
   receivers to make a judgement whether to accept an IP datagram as
   "fresh" [RFC4949].  An In-band OAM transport header
   [I-D.weis-ippm-ioam-gre] is used to encode the timestamp.  This
   document defines semantics regarding the use of the timestamp to
   determine freshness.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IPsec Delivery Delay Detection Protocol (IP-D3P)

   A D3P datagram consists of an IP packet to which an "in-situ"
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) header containing a
   timestamp is added, and then is protected by an IPsec [RFC4301]
   security protocol.  Receivers of the packet use the timestamp to
   determine whether or not the packet has been recently generated.
   Receivers compare the timestamp delivered in the IP packet to their
   local time and make a determination as to whether it should be
   accepted.  D3P makes no explicit judgement as to whether a receiver
   has previously received a copy of this particular packet.  Rather, it
   allows the receiver to determine whether the packet has been delayed
   in delivery beyond an acceptable point in time.  A typical policy
   would be to choose a time larger than a reasonable delivery time,
   which delay indicates a possible packet delay attack.

   The value in the timestamp field indicates the sender's current time.
   When the timestamp type is defined as POSIX-TIME, this is the time
   since the POSIX Epoch [POSIX.1] (i..e., time beginning January 1,
   1970 not counting leap seconds).

2.1.  Outbound Packet Processing

   An "in-situ" OAM header is added to the beginning of the packet.  The
   optional GRE checksum MUST be omitted (and is not required because
   the IPsec integrity check will ensure that the packet has not been

   altered).  The GRE Protocol Type MUST be the value indicating "In-
   situ OAM (IOAM)" as defined in [I-D.weis-ippm-ioam-gre].  The IOAM-
   Type in the IOAM header MUST be the value indicating "IOAM E2E Option
   Type" (3) as defined in Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].
   When the timestamp type is defined as POSIX-TIME, the IOAM-E2E-Type
   option header MUST indicate the presence of a POSIX timestamp.  The
   sender inserts the current time value from the system clock into the
   Timestamp field as follows.  The 32 least significant bits of the
   Seconds field from the POSIX.1 timeval structure is placed in the
   Seconds field; the Microseconds field from the POSIX.1 timeval
   structure is placed into the Subseconds field.

   When IPsec transport mode encapsulation is used with D3P, the GRE and
   IOAM encapsulations are added immediately following the IP header.
   An example of a protected TCP segment is shown in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2.  The least significant octet in the IOAM protocol header
   "Next Protocol" field is set to the IP Protocol value of TCP (0x06),
   preceded by an octet of 0x00 to indicate it is an IP Protocol type.
   Several IP header fields need to be adjusted when adding the D3P
   encapsulations: Total Length is adjusted to the length of the entire
   encapsulated IP datagram.  The Protocol field (IPv4 header) or Next
   Header field (IPv6) is set to 47 identifying GRE as the next
   protocol, and the header checksum is adjusted.  Finally, the IPsec
   outbound packet processing is performed.

                Figure 2: IPv6 Transport Mode Encapsulation

   When IPsec tunnel mode encapsulation is used with D3P, the GRE and
   IOAM encapsulations are added immediately after the outer IP header,
   such that the original IP datagram is fully encapsulated.  An example
   showing tunnel mode encapsulation of a TCP segment is shown in
   Figure 3 and Figure 4.  The IOAM protocol header "Next Protocol"
   field is set to the Ethertype representing IPv4 (0x0800) or IPv6
   (0x86DD).  The Protocol field in the outer IPv4 header or Next Header
   field in the outer IPv6 header is set to 47 identifying GRE as the
   next protocol.  Finally, the IPsec outbound packet processing is
   performed.

2.2.  Inbound Packet Processing

   A receiver performs IPsec inbound processing as usual (e.g.,
   Section 3.4 of [RFC4303] or Section 3.4 of [RFC4302]).  It then
   validates that the GRE Protocol Type IOAM fields are present as
   specified in Section 2.1.  It then extracts the timestamp and
   compares it to a sliding window maintained by the receiver.  A
   timestamp found within the sliding window is accepted, and the packet
   is treated as a fresh packet.  If the timestamp is outside of the
   receiver's window, the packet is discarded.

   Figure 5 shows the sliding window used by D3P.  A receiver chooses a
   window size of W, which lies between Ws and We centered around the
   current time of the receiver (Tr).  When a packet is received with a
   Timestamp Ts that lies below Ws, it is rejected as being too old.  If
   Ts lies in between Ws and We it is accepted as a fresh packet.  If Ts
   is in advance of We it is rejected as an invalid time.  However, the
   reason for rejection (being too old or invalid) MUST NOT be
   discernible to any entity other than the receiver who rejected the
   packet.

                         Reject  | Accept |   Reject
                        (Replay) |        | (Invalid)
                     -------------------------------->
                     t           Ws   |   We
                                      |
                                      Tr

                       Figure 5: D3P Sliding Window

   Special care must be taken when values of Ts are expected to approach
   the point where they wrap (e.g., for POSIX-TIME the first time will
   be in the year 2038).  Implementations may wish to represent Tr as
   the same size value represented within Ts.  When the maximum value of
   Tr fits within W, the next value is considered zero, and the window
   increments in the usual way.  For example, if the size of W is 5
   seconds and Tr is exactly 2^32-1, then Ws would be 2^32-3 and We
   would be 1.

   Decapsulation happens as follows.  For IPsec tunnel mode
   encapsulation the GRE and IOAM headers are removed, resulting in the
   original IP datagram.  For IPsec transport mode encapsulation, the
   Next Protocol field from the IOAM header is placed into the original
   IP header field, and the GRE header is removed from the packet.  New
   Total Length and checksum fields of the IP header are also restored
   by the receiver.

   When IPsec SA policy specifies IPsec Transport Mode, the following
   requirements apply.  If the IPsec SA policy specifies the use of D3P,
   but the GRE header with Protocol Type indicating "In-situ OAM (IOAM)"
   is missing, then the IP packet MUST be discarded as the delay
   protection policy cannot be checked.  If the IPsec SA policy does not
   specify the use of D3P, but the packet includes a GRE header with
   Protocol Type indicating "In-situ OAM (IOAM)" , then it SHOULD
   forward the packet in case it is intended for another IOAM consumer.

   When IPsec SA policy specifies IPsec Tunnel Mode, the following
   requirements apply.  If the IPsec SA policy specifies the use of D3P,
   but the GRE header with Protocol Type indicating "In-situ OAM (IOAM)"
   is missing, then the IP packet MUST be discarded as the delay
   protection policy cannot be checked.  If the IPsec SA policy does not
   specify the use of D3P, but the packet includes a GRE header with
   Protocol Type of IOAM_E2E, the receiver would understand that the
   IPsec sender must have added it in the last stage of encapsulation
   (as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4).  Since D3P is not part of the
   IPsec SA policy, the receiver cannot process the D3P packet and MUST
   discard it.

3.  Key Management Considerations

3.1.  GDOI

   The Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) [RFC6407] is a group key
   management protocol used to distribute group policy and keying
   material to a set of Group Members (GMs).  When groups using GDOI key
   management services require the use of D3P, a GDOI Group Controller/
   Key Server (GCKS) distributes this policy in a Group Associated
   Policy (GAP) payload using the D3P-TYPE attribute.  This attribute
   indicates the use of D3P for all SA TEKs distributed within the SA
   payload, and defines the Type of timestamp that is to be placed into
   datagrams matching those SA TEKs.  Value for the D3P-TYPE attribute
   are taken from the D3P Type Registry.

   When the policy delivered by the GCKS includes a D3P-TYPE attribute,
   it MUST also define the size of the time window (i.e., W described in
   Section 2.2).  The window size MUST be a value greater than zero.
   The GCKS distributes the value of W using the GAP payload D3P-
   WINDOWSIZE attribute.  The value of the attribute is in the units
   defined by the Type.  For the POSIX-TIME attribute the value is in
   milliseconds.

3.2.  IKEv2

   When D3P is requested for an IPsec SA negotiated by IKEv2, a notify
   message of type D3P_SUPPORTED is sent to the IKE2 peer, which
   specifies the D3P type requested.  The choice of WINDOWSIZE is a
   local matter when a device requests for D3P to be used on its inbound
   SA.

4.  Security Considerations

   D3P provides an indication of how recently an IP packet was emitted
   by a sender.  When replay protection is possible (e.g., single-sender
   IPsec SAs) IPsec replay protection SHOULD also be enabled.  When D3P
   is used without replay protection a receiver can detect stale packets
   but packets replayed within its D3P sliding window are not detected.

   A delay detection protocol needs to be integrity protected.  As
   defined in this memo, D3P MUST be protected by an IPsec transform.
   IPsec integrity protection defends against active man in the middle
   attackers changing the timestamp (e.g., making it appear to be stale
   or invalid).

   The D3P Type defined in this memo uses the system clock.  In many
   cases, the system clock is set from an external protocol (e.g., NTP
   [RFC5905]), and indeed this will maximize the likelihood that the
   system clocks of both sender and receiver are synchronized.  However,
   care should be taken that external protocol is resistant to a man in
   the middle attack.  For example, NTP packets could be distributed
   within an independent well-protected network believed not available
   to active man in the middle attackers, or the NTP Message Digest
   could be used to provide integrity protection.

   The D3P sliding window can wrap, thus timestamps from previous
   generations of the sliding window will be treated as valid packets.
   Attackers wishing to replay packets containing a repeated timestamp
   would need to collect ancient packets containing timestamps valid
   within the current sliding window of the receiver.  When the
   timestamp is of type POSIX-TIME, these packets would have been
   created about 138 years prior to the current time.  The risk of
   replayed packets containing a repeated but valid timestamp is
   considered to be a low risk.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The following additions are made to the GDOI Payloads [GDOI-REG]

   registry.

   Attribute type D3P-TYPE is a Basic attribute and takes the value of
   TBD-1.  Values for this attribute are shown in the following table.
   The terms Reserved and Unassigned are to be applied as defined in
   [RFC8126].

                        Value           Type
                        ------          ----
                          0             Reserved
                          1             POSIX-TIME
                         2-128          Unassigned
                        129-255         Private Use

   Attribute type D3P-WINDOWSIZE is a Variable attribute and takes the
   value of TBD-2.  There are no described set of valid values.

   A new message type is added to the IKEv2 Notify Message Types -
   Status Types IKEv2 registry: D3P_SUPPORTED.  The Notification Data
   field contains one octet, which is a value from a new registry "IKEv2
   Notification D3P Transform IDs".

                        Value           Type
                        -----           ----
                           0            Reserved
                           1            POSIX-TIME
                          2-240         Unassigned
                        241-255         Private Use

6.  Acknowledgements

   Adrian Farrell suggested the use of "In-situ" OAM (IOAM).  Frank
   Brockners and Shwetha Bhandari assisted in identifying the IOAM data
   encapsulation and data objects.

   Some diagrams were adapted from similar diagrams in [RFC4303].
