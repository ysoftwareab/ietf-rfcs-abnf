2. Introduction

   World-Wide Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety of
   consumer electronic devices, such as television sets and television
   set-top boxes, which are capable of receiving television programming
   from either terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, or cable. On
   these devices, some of the URI schemes described in [1] are
   inappropriate. For example, many of these devices lack local
   storage, so the "file" scheme is of little use. On the other hand,
   because these devices do have access to television broadcasts, this
   document describes a widely-implemented URI scheme to refer to such
   broadcasts.  The goal of this document is to capture the current
   usage of these URIs, and to suggest some directions for future
   standardization of them.

3. Television URI

   The basic structure of a television URI is:

        tv:<broadcast>

   where broadcast is a description of the data source. The description
   can take the form of an over-the-air broadcast call sign, or a
   network identifier. For example:

        tv:wqed    the WQED station
        tv:nbc     the NBC network

3.1. Scheme-only form

   A simplest form of the "tv:" URI scheme is used to refer to the
   "current" or "default" channel:

        tv:

   This URI refers to whichever television broadcast is currently being
   received by the device. It is often used in combination with HTML
   content that is actually being broadcast along with the audio and
   video, where the meaning of "current broadcast" is quite unambiguous
   (because it is the broadcast along with which the content containing
   the URI was received). This is in fact the most common usage of the
   "tv:" scheme today, and is explicitly referenced by the recently
   published specification of the Advanced Television Enhancement Forum
   [2].

3.2 Call signs

   All terrestrial television broadcasters are assigned call signs to
   identify their signal. These are generally assigned by national
   authorities (such as the Federal Communications Commission in the
   United States) and are world unique.  The global namespace is
   managed by the International Communications Union, which assigns
   portions to member countries (see [3]). Examples of URIs using call
   signs are:

        tv:kdka
        tv:kron

   In order to support these call signs in a "tv:" URI, a receiver must
   implement a means to map known call signs to frequencies. The nature
   of this map and the way in which it is used will be browser- and
   device-specific and is beyond the scope of this document. In this
   way, the "tv:" scheme is somewhat analogous to the "news:" and
   "file:" schemes in [1]: it merely names a television broadcast
   signal but assumes that the local browser has some means for
   actually retrieving that signal on the local device.  A variety of
   software systems currently provide device-specific mappings from
   such identifiers to specific channel numbers or directly to

            Uniform Resource Identifiers for TV Broadcasts  June, 1999

   frequencies.  These systems can be incorporated into television sets
   or set-top boxes to facilitate the interpretation of television URIs
   by the client device.

3.3 Network identifiers

   Many modern television networks are not broadcast over-the-air, but
   available only through cable or satellite subscriptions. The
   identifiers for these networks (such as the familiar CNN and HBO)
   are not regulated at this time. The current practice is simply to
   compare network identifiers against a list of those known to be
   available on the receiver. Examples of such URIs include:

        tv:pbs
        tv:cnn
        tv:hbo

   The same issues apply to mapping these identifiers to tuning
   frequencies as are discussed in 3.2.

   The flat namespace for network identifiers poses a serious problem
   going forward.  IANA registration could be used avoid collisions,
   but at the cost of restricting bona fide networks with identical
   identifiers from using their common abbreviations in these URIs.
   Section 3.5 proposes possible directions for resolving this
   limitation.

3.4 Channel numbers

   Previous drafts of this specification allowed broadcasts to be
   identified by channel numbers, such as "tv:4", and this form is
   currently supported by several independent platforms.  The channel
   numbers generally correspond to tuning frequencies in the various
   national broadcast frequency standards; for example, "tv:4" in the
   United states would be found at 66 MHz.

   However, because this mapping of channel numbers to frequencies
   varies from country to country, this form is particularly ill-suited
   to use on the Internet.  It has been removed from this draft, but
   would likely be re-introduced in a future specification that
   incorporated the hierarchical forms discussed in section 3.5.

3.5 Hierarchical forms

   Several people have proposed hierarchical forms of television URIs,
   following the general form:

        tv://<tuning-space>/<broadcast>

   where tuning-space describes a specific namespace (such as "ntsc"
   for analog broadcasts in North America, or "atsc" for digital
   broadcasts there), and where broadcast might also be hierarchical

            Uniform Resource Identifiers for TV Broadcasts  June, 1999

   (such "as nbc/2" for NBC's second stream of programming).  Because
   no consensus yet exists on these forms, all hierarchical forms of
   "tv:" URIs are reserved for future specifications.

   These hierarchical forms also will be important in allowing
   geographically separated networks (such as the Australian Broadcast
   Corporation and the American Broadcast Company) to share
   identifiers, and for disambiguating call signs and network
   identifiers in cases where they collide. It is expected that IANA
   will be asked to register both tuning spaces and identifiers within
   some of those spaces.

4. BNF for Television URIs

   The following is a formal specification for the new URIs:

      tvuri        = "tv:" [ broadcast ]
      broadcast    = call-sign | network-id
      call-sign    = 1*[ alpha | digit ]
      network-id   = 1*[ alpha | digit | safe | extra ]

   The definitions of alpha, digit, safe, and extra are from RFC 2396
   [1]. Both call-sign and network-id are case-insensitive.

5. Acknowledgments

   Many of the ideas in this document came out of conversations with
   Andrew Lochart. Other people who supplied valuable input include
   Matt Trifiro and Eric Del Sesto.  The original draft of this URI
   scheme was developed while the author was at Wink Communications.
   More recent suggestions have come from Lee Acton, Jonathan Boltax,
   Dean Blackketter, Michael Dolan, Iain Hackett, Jim Helman, Sean
   McDowell, David Mott, Scott Watson, and others in the ATVEF
   Technical Working Group (which the authors co-chaired).

6. Security Considerations

   This new URI scheme is subject to the same security implications as
   the general URI scheme [1]. It is possible that the mere act of
   viewing a television broadcast signal may cause costs to be incurred
   to the viewer in some instances (e.g., "pay-per-view" movies and
   events). Any software that uses this URI scheme to allow automatic
   tuning of a client device to a particular television broadcast
   signal should alert users before performing actions that may incur
   costs to the user.
