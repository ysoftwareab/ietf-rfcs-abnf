1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] specification defines a set of components
   used to describe calendar data.  One of those is the "VALARM"
   component which appears as a sub-component of "VEVENT" and "VTODO"
   components.  The "VALARM" component is used to specify a reminder for
   an event or task.  Different alarm actions are possible, as are
   different ways to specify how the alarm is triggered.

   As iCalendar has become more widely used and as client-server
   protocols such as CalDAV [RFC4791] have become more prevalent,
   several issues with "VALARM" components have arisen.  Most of these
   relate to the need to extend the existing "VALARM" component with new
   properties and behaviors to allow clients and servers to accomplish
   specific tasks in an interoperable manner.  For example, clients
   typically need a way to specify that an alarm has been dismissed by a
   calendar user, or has been "snoozed" by a set amount of time.  To
   date, this has been done through the use of custom "X-" properties

   specific to each client implementation, leading to poor
   interoperability.

   This specification defines a set of extensions to "VALARM" components
   to cover common requirements for alarms not currently addressed in
   iCalendar.  Each extension is defined in a separate section below.
   For the most part, each extension can be supported independently of
   the others, though in some cases one extension will require another.
   In addition, this specification describes mechanisms by which clients
   can interoperably implement common features such as "snoozing".

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [1] [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

3.  Extensible syntax for VALARM

   Section 3.6.6 of [RFC5545] defines the syntax for "VALARM" components
   and properties within them.  However, as written, it is hard to
   extend this by adding, e.g., a new property common to all types of
   alarm.  Since many of the extensions defined in this document need to
   extend the base syntax, an alternative form for the base syntax is
   defined here, with the goal of simplifying specification of the
   extensions.

   A "VALARM" calendar component is re-defined by the following
   notation:

   alarmcext  = "BEGIN" ":" "VALARM" CRLF
                alarmprop
                "END" ":" "VALARM" CRLF

   alarmprop  = *(

                ; the following are REQUIRED,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                action / trigger /

                ; one set of action properties MUST be
                ; present and MUST match the action specified
                ; in the ACTION property

                actionprops /

                ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                ; and MAY occur more than once

                x-prop / iana-prop

                )

   actionprops = audiopropext / disppropext / emailpropext

   audiopropext  = *(

                   ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
                   ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
                   ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other

                   duration / repeat /

                   ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   attach

                   )

   disppropext = *(

                  attach

                  )

4.  Alarm Unique Identifier

   This extension adds a "UID" property to "VALARM" components to allow
   a unique identifier to be specified.  The value of this property can
   then be used to refer uniquely to the "VALARM" component.

   The "UID" property defined here follows the definition in
   Section 3.8.4.7 of [RFC5545] with the security and privacy updates in
   Section 5.3 of [RFC7986].  In particular it MUST be a globally unique
   identifier that does not contain any security- or privacy-sensitive
   information.

   The "VALARM" component defined in Section 3 is extended here as:

   alarmprop  /= *(

                 ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                 uid

                 )

5.  Alarm Related To

   It is often convenient to relate one or more "VALARM" components to
   other "VALARM" components (e.g., see Section 7).  This can be
   accomplished if the "VALARM" components each have their own "UID"
   property (as per Section 4).

   This specification updates the usage of the "RELATED-TO" property
   defined in Section 3.8.4.5 of [RFC5545] to enable its use with
   "VALARM" components.  Specific types of relationships between
   "VALARM" components can be identified by registering new values for
   the "RELTYPE" property parameter defined in Section 3.2.15 of
   [RFC5545].

   The "VALARM" component defined in Section 3 is extended here as:

   alarmprop  /= *(

                 ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MAY occur more than once

                 related

                 )

6.  Alarm Acknowledgement

   There is currently no way for a "VALARM" component to indicate
   whether it has been triggered and acknowledged.  With the advent of a
   standard client/server protocol for calendaring and scheduling data
   ([RFC4791]) it is quite possible for an event with an alarm to exist
   on multiple clients in addition to the server.  If each of those is
   responsible for performing the action when an alarm triggers, then
   multiple "alerts" are generated by different devices.  In such a
   situation, a calendar user would like to be able to "dismiss" the
   alarm on one device and have it automatically dismissed on the others
   too.

   Also, with recurring events that have alarms, it is important to know
   when the last alarm in the recurring set was acknowledged, so that
   the client can determine whether past alarms have been missed.

   To address these needs, this specification adds an "ACKNOWLEDGED"
   property to "VALARM" components to indicate when the alarm was last
   sent or acknowledged.  This is defined by the syntax below.

   alarmprop       /= *(

                      ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                      ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                      acknowledged

                      )

6.1.  Acknowledged Property

   Property Name:  ACKNOWLEDGED

   Purpose:  This property specifies the UTC date and time at which the
      corresponding alarm was last sent or acknowledged.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified within "VALARM" calendar
      components.

   Description:  This property is used to specify when an alarm was last
      sent or acknowledged.  This allows clients to determine when a
      pending alarm has been acknowledged by a calendar user so that any
      alerts can be dismissed across multiple devices.  It also allows
      clients to track repeating alarms or alarms on recurring events or
      to-dos to ensure that the right number of missed alarms can be
      tracked.

      Clients SHOULD set this property to the current date-time value in
      UTC when a calendar user acknowledges a pending alarm.  Certain
      kinds of alarm may not provide feedback as to when the calendar
      user sees them, for example email based alerts.  For those kinds
      of alarms, the client SHOULD set this property when the alarm is
      triggered and the action successfully carried out.

      When an alarm is triggered on a client, clients can check to see
      if an "ACKNOWLEDGED" property is present.  If it is, and the value
      of that property is greater than or equal to the computed trigger
      time for the alarm, then the client SHOULD NOT trigger the alarm.
      Similarly, if an alarm has been triggered and an "alert" presented
      to a calendar user, clients can monitor the iCalendar data to
      determine whether an "ACKNOWLEDGED" property is added or changed
      in the alarm component.  If the value of any "ACKNOWLEDGED"
      property in the alarm changes and is greater than or equal to the

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                  July 2020


      trigger time of the alarm, then clients SHOULD dismiss or cancel
      any "alert" presented to the calendar user.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   acknowledged = "ACKNOWLEDGED" acknowledgedparam ":" datetime CRLF

   acknowledgedparam  = *(

                        ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                        ; and MAY occur more than once

                        (";" other-param)

                        )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   ACKNOWLEDGED:20090604T084500Z

7.  Snoozing Alarms

   Users often want to "snooze" an alarm, and this specification defines
   a standard approach to accomplish that.

   To "snooze" an alarm, clients create a new "VALARM" component within
   the parent component of the "VALARM" that was triggered and is being
   "snoozed" (i.e., as a "sibling" component of the "VALARM" being
   snoozed).  The new "VALARM" MUST be set to trigger at the user's
   chosen "snooze" interval after the original alarm triggered.  Clients
   SHOULD use an absolute "TRIGGER" property with a "DATE-TIME" value
   specified in UTC.

   Clients SHOULD add a "RELATED-TO" property to the new "VALARM"
   component with a value set to the "UID" property value of the
   "VALARM" component being snoozed.  If the "VALARM" component being
   snoozed does not already have a "UID" property, the client SHOULD add
   one.  The "RELATED-TO" property added to the new "VALARM" component
   SHOULD include a "RELTYPE" property parameter with a value set to
   "SNOOZE".

   When the "snooze" alarm is triggered and dismissed the client SHOULD
   remove the corresponding "VALARM" component, or set the
   "ACKNOWLEDGED" property (see Section 6.1).  Alternatively, if the
   "snooze" alarm is itself "snoozed", the client SHOULD remove the
   original "snooze" alarm and create a new one, with the appropriate
   trigger time and relationship set.

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                  July 2020


7.1.  Relationship Type Property Parameter

   This specification adds the "SNOOZE" relationship type for use with
   the "RELTYPE" property defined in Section 3.2.15 of [RFC5545].  This
   is used to relate a "snoozed" "VALARM" component to the original
   alarm that the "snooze" was generated for.

8.  Alarm Proximity Trigger

   VALARMs are currently triggered when a specific date-time is reached.
   It is also desirable to be able to trigger alarms based on location,
   e.g. when arriving at or departing from a particular location.

   This specification adds the following properties to "VALARM"
   components to indicate when an alarm can be triggered based on
   location.

      "PROXIMITY" - indicates that a location based trigger is to be
      used and which direction of motion is used for the trigger

      "STRUCTURED-LOCATION" [I-D.ietf-calext-eventpub-extensions] - used
      to indicate the actual location to trigger off, specified using a
      geo: URI [RFC5870] which allows for two or three coordinate values
      with an optional uncertainty

   alarmprop       /= *(

                      ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                      ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                      proximity /

                      ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                      ; and MAY occur more than once, but only
                      ; when a PROXIMITY property is also present

                      structured-location

                      )

   Typically, when a "PROXIMITY" property is used there is no need to
   specify a time-based trigger using the "TRIGGER" property.  However,
   since "TRIGGER" is defined as a required property for a "VALARM"
   component, for backwards compatibility it has to be present, but
   ignored.  To indicate a "TRIGGER" that is to be ignored, clients
   SHOULD use a value a long time in the past.  A value of
   "19760401T005545Z" has been commonly used for this purpose.

8.1.  Proximity Property

   Property Name:  PROXIMITY

   Purpose:  This property indicates that a location based trigger is
      applied to an alarm.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified within "VALARM" calendar
      components.

   Description:  This property is used to indicate that an alarm has a
      location-based trigger.  Its value identifies the direction of
      motion used to trigger the alarm.  One or more location values are
      set using "STRUCTURED-LOCATION" properties.

      When the property value is set to "ARRIVE", the alarm is triggered
      when the calendar user agent arrives in the vicinity of any of the
      specified locations.  When set to "DEPART", the alarm is triggered
      when the calendar user agent departs from the vicinity of any
      specified locations.

      When the property value is set to "CONNECT", the alarm is
      triggered when the calendar user agent connects to a Bluetooth(R)
      [BTcore]-enabled automobile.  When set to "DISCONNECT", the alarm
      is triggered when the calendar user agent disconnects from a
      Bluetooth(R)-enabled automobile.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   proximity = "PROXIMITY" proximityparam ":" proximityvalue CRLF

   proximityparam  = *(

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" other-param)

                     )

   proximityvalue  = "ARRIVE" / "DEPART" /
                     "CONNECT" / "DISCONNECT" / iana-token / x-name

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   PROXIMITY:ARRIVE

8.2.  Example

   The following example shows a "VALARM" component with a proximity
   trigger set to trigger when the device running the calendar user
   agent leaves the vicinity defined by the structured location
   property.  Note use of the "u=" parameter with the "geo" URI to

9.  Security Considerations

   VALARMs, if not monitored properly, can be used to "spam" users and/
   or leak personal information.  For instance, an unwanted audio or
   display alert could be considered spam.  Or an email alert could be
   used to leak a user's location to a third party or to send
   unsolicited email to multiple users.  Therefore, CalDAV clients and
   servers that accept iCalendar data from a third party (e.g. via iTIP
   [RFC5546], a subscription feed, or a shared calendar) SHOULD remove
   all VALARMs from the data prior to storing in their calendar system.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   Proximity VALARMs, if not used carefully, can leak a user's past,
   present, or future location.  For instance, storing an iCalendar
   resource containing proxmity VALARMs to a shared calendar on CalDAV
   server can expose to anyone that has access to that calendar the
   user's intent to leave from or arrive at a particular location at
   some future time.  Furthermore, if a CalDAV client updates the shared
   iCalendar resource with an ACKNOWLEDGED property when the alarm is
   triggered, will leak the exact date and time that the user left from
   or arrived at the location.  Therefore, CalDAV clients that implement
   proximity alarms SHOULD give users the option of storing and/or
   acknowledging the alarms on the local device only and not storing the
   alarm and/or acknowledgment on a remote server.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  Property Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar properties to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.2.3 of [RFC5545]:

             +--------------+---------+----------------------+
             | Property     | Status  | Reference            |
             +--------------+---------+----------------------+
             | ACKNOWLEDGED | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 6.1 |
             | PROXIMITY    | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 8.1 |
             +--------------+---------+----------------------+

11.2.  Relationship Types Registry

   This document defines the following new iCalendar relationship type
   to be added to the registry defined in Section 8.3.8 of [RFC5545]:

          +-------------------+---------+----------------------+
          | Relationship Type | Status  | Reference            |
          +-------------------+---------+----------------------+
          | SNOOZE            | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 7.1 |
          +-------------------+---------+----------------------+

11.3.  Proximity Value Registry

   This document creates a new iCalendar registry for values of the
   "PROXIMITY" property:

              +------------+---------+----------------------+
              | Value      | Status  | Reference            |
              +------------+---------+----------------------+
              | ARRIVE     | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 8.1 |
              | DEPART     | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 8.1 |
              | CONNECT    | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 8.1 |
              | DISCONNECT | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 8.1 |
              +------------+---------+----------------------+
