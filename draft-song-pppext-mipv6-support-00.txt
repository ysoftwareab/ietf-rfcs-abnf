Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,
   configuring, and testing the data-link connection; and a family of
   Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring
   different network-layer protocols.

   The MIPv6 link local router that support Mobile Node connection via 
   PPP, need to know whether the PPP client is MIPv6 node or not. 
   Because the link operator may have different local policy for MIPv6 
   node (ex. support of user mobility). Currently, the IPv6CP option [2] 
   supports establishment and configuration of the IPv6 over PPP. 
   However, MIPv6 link local router cannot differentiate IPv6 node and 
   MIPv6 node which is connected over PPP.  This document defines the 
   new IPCP opton for the MIPv6 support.

1. Problem Statement

   The MIPv6 Link local router which may be providing PPP connetion,
   currently cannot identify whether the connection is requested by 
   Mobile IPv6 Node or IPv6 node.  The MIPv6 service is value added 
   service for the operator, and the operator may want to support user 
   mobility service over Mobile IPv6.  Therefore it is important to let 
   local router which is a PPP termination point to be able to identify 
   MIPv6 service. 


2.  Configuration Options

   The Configuration Option format and basic options are already defined
   for IPCP [3].

   The most updated value of the IPCP Option Type field are specified in 
   the IANA website [4].  This document concerns the following values:

       [?]      Mobile IPv6 (Pending for the IANA number assignment)


2.1.  Mobile IPv6 Option

   Description

   Some operator may want to differentiate IPv6 node and MIPv6 node.  
   This mechanism let Mobile Node to specify MIPv6 service.


   A summary of the  Configuration Option format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   The Mobile-IPv6 Configuration Option for IPCP is defined as follows:
   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Type

       ?  (MIPv6)
     
     Length

       10

     Interface-Identifier

       The 64-bit Interface-Identifier which is very likely to be unique 
       on the link or zero if a good source of uniqueness can not be 
       found.

     Default

       If no valid interface identifier can be successfully negotiated, 
       no default Interface-Identifier value should be assumed. The 
       procedures for recovering from such a case are unspecified.  
       One approach is to manually configure the interface identifier of 
       the interface. [2]



3.  IANA Considerations
   Requires IPCP option number assignemnt
