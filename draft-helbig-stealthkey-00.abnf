A = (ts_0-t_0)/r an integer and ts_0 smaller or equal to the actual
C = C1*2^32+S,     if C2+w > S > C2
C = (C1+1)*2^32+S, if C2 > S and C2+w >= 2^32+S
C = C1*2^32+C2     else

w = 64.

C=i*r+r.
    
C = q+i*r, with q and i integers and 0 < q <=r and i >= 0. Assume
C = C1*2^32+C2 and C = i*r+q, where C1, C2, i and q are integers
