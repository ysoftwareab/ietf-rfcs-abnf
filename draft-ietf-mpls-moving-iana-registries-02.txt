  Moving Generic Associated Channel  (G-ACh) IANA registries to a new
                                registry
               draft-ietf-mpls-moving-iana-registries-02

Abstract

   RFC 5586 generalized the applicability of the pseudowire Associated
   Channel Header (PW-ACH) into the Generic Associated Channel G-Ach.
   However, registries and allocations of G-ACh parameters had been
   distributed throughout different, sometimes unrelated, registries.
   This document coalesces these into a new "Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh)" registry under the "Multiprotocol Label Switching
   Architecture (MPLS)" heading.  This document updates RFC 5586.

   This document also updates RFC 6374, RFC 6428, RFC 6378, RFC 6427,
   RFC-ietf-mpls-gach-adv, and RFC-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing.

Internet-Draft          Creating G-ACh registries          December 2013


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5586 generalized the PW-ACH into the G-Ach.  However, registries
   and allocations of G-ACh namespaces had been distributed throughout
   different registries.  This document coalesces these into a new
   "Generic Associated Channel registry" in the "Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Architecture (MPLS)" name space.  This is an update to RFC
   RFC 5586 [RFC5586].

   Further, the "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" registry is
   renamed to "MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) Types
   (including Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)" to make its
   generalized status explicit, and is moved into the newly created
   registry.

   Additionally, RFC 6374 [RFC6374], RFC 6428 [RFC6428], RFC 6378]
   [RFC6378], RFC 6427 [RFC6427], RFC-ietf-mpls-gach-adv
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv], and RFC-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing] specify allocations within the
   G-ACh that are now moved into the new registry.

   With respect to where to find these IANA registries, the RFCs listed
   above are updated as indicated in Section 3; however the registries
   themselves are not changed (with the exception of one being renamed).
   They are moved unchanged to the new registry.

   Editor's note:
   Need to fix the references to RFC-ietf-mpls-gach-adv and RFC-ietf-
   mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing


2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add this document as a reference for any
   registry that is moved or renamed as a result of actions requested by
   this document.

   IANA is also requested to replace all the relocated registries with
   pointers to the new URL or with a redirect.

2.1.  Creation of a new Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) IANA registry

   IANA is requested to create a new "Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh)" registry under the "Multiprotocol Label Switching
   Architecture (MPLS)" heading.

2.2.   Renaming and moving the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types
      registry

   This document renames the "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types"
   [IANA-PWE3] into "MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) Types
   (including Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)".  This registry is
   moved and included as the first registration in the registry created
   in Section 2.1 because any additional registration is dependent upon
   the Associated Channel Header Type.

   At the time of publishing this document and moving the registry, the
   following RFCs have G-Ach Types allocated: [I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv],
   [RFC4385], [RFC5586], [RFC5718], [RFC5885], [RFC6374], [RFC6378],
   [RFC6426], [RFC6427], [RFC6428], [RFC6435], [RFC6478], and [RFC6671].

2.3.  Consolidating G-ACh registries

   This document further updates the following RFCs by moving the G-ACh
   related registrations to a common "MPLS Generic Associated Channel
   Parameters" registry:

   o  From the PWE Registry [IANA-PWE3]:

      *  MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) Types [RFC5586]

      *  G-ACh Advertisement Protocol Application Registry
         [I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv]

      *  G-ACh Advertisement Protocol TLV Registry
         [I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv]

      *  G-ACh Advertisement Protocol: Ethernet Interface Parameters
         [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing]

      *  CC/CV MEP-ID TLV Registry [RFC6428]

   o  From the LSP Ping Registry [IANA-LSP-Ping]:

      *  Measurement Timestamp Type [RFC6374]

      *  Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code: Query Codes [RFC6374]

      *  Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code: Response Codes [RFC6374]

      *  MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object [RFC6374]

Internet-Draft          Creating G-ACh registries          December 2013


   o  From the MPLS OAM Registry [IANA-MPLS-OAM]:

      *  MPLS Fault OAM Message Type Registry [RFC6427]

      *  MPLS Fault OAM Flag Registry [RFC6427]

      *  MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry [RFC6427]

      *  MPLS PSC Request Registry [RFC6378]

      *  MPLS PSC TLV Registry [RFC6378]

      Note that all the sub-registries in [IANA-MPLS-OAM] are moved from
      "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Operations, Administration,
      and Management (OAM) Parameters" registry.  The IANA is therefore
      requested to remove the "MPLS OAM" registry.


3.  RFC Updates

   This document updates [RFC5586] renaming the "Pseudowire Associated
   Channel Types" [IANA-PWE3] into "MPLS Generalized Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Types (including Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)".

   This document also updates the following RFCs by moving the G-ACh
   related registrations to a common "MPLS Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh)" registry: RFC 6374, RFC 6428, RFC 6378, RFC 6427, RFC-ietf-
   mpls-gach-adv, and RFC-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing.

   All the registries listed above are moved without any changes to
   their content.  The reason to move them is to create on single place
   where it is possible to find all the G-ACh parameters.


4.  Security Considerations

   The IANA instructions in this document do not directly introduce any
   new security issues.


5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors want to thank Amanda Barber for review and valuable
   comments.
