Internet Draft           Management Target MIB             26 March 1997


1.  Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used for
managing a list of network management destinations (targets) and the
information needed to get to them and to group them.

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

They are: The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of
three major components.  They are:

  the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
  describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

  the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects for
  the Internet suite of protocols.

  the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol for
  accessing managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.


2.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

Systems that support SNMP commonly need a list of target systems to
which they can send SNMP messages.  On system that performs only agent
functions this need is for Traps, which requires a subset of the
information appropriate to a system that sends manager messages.  A
system that sends only Inform of the manager messages needs less than a
more general-purpose manager.  This MIB is designed with explicit
subsets for those situations.

This MIB provides infrastructure for other MIBs in the form of target
systems or groups of target systems that can be destinations for SNMP
requests and notifications.  It was designed with the following
requirements and goals in mind.

To address an SNMP message you need:

     transport type, address, and port

     access control (e.g. community)

All of those should be embodied in the selector.

Selection needs to be by some scoping related to a logical entity, but
with finer granularity based on level of access (e.g. read-only or
read-write).

Selection should work the same for an individual scope or a group of
scopes.

Defining a group must work by manual assignment or automation.

All of this must suit either a relatively powerful manager or mid-level
manager, as well as a somewhat more limited self-managing system.
