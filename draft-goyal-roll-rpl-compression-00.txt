1.  Introduction

   RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] is an IPv6 routing protocol for low power and
   lossy networks.  It defines a number of ICMPv6 control messages for
   its operation.  These messages are susceptible to fragmentation when
   RPL is deployed over a link layer with a small payload (e.g.  IEEE
   802.15.4, where the MAC payload can be as small as 81 bytes).  This
   document specifies a compression format for ICMPv6 RPL control
   messages to minimize such fragmentation.  This document currently
   defines the compression format for RPL's DODAG Information Object
   (DIO) base object, DODAG Configuration Option and some of the Routing
   Metric/Constraint objects.  Later versions of this document may
   include the compression formats for other RPL messages and options.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics],
   [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl] and [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc].


2.  RPL ICMPv6 Message Compression

   Various fields of a compressed ICMPv6 messages are as follows:

   o  Type: 155, as specified in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl];

   o  Code: The Code value of the compressed version of an RPL ICMPv6
      message is obtained by setting the 7th bit in the Code value
      associated with the corresponding uncompressed message.  For
      example, the Code associated with a compressed DODAG Information
      Object is 0x40.

   o  Checksum: The 16-bit Checksum for a compressed RPL message is
      calculated in the same manner as for the uncompressed message.

   o  Base: The Base object carried in the message is compressed in the
      manner described in Section 3.

   o  Option(s): An option carried in a compressed RPL ICMPv6 message
      MAY be compressed as described in Section 4 or it MAY be carried
      uncompressed as in an uncompressed message.

3.  RPL Base Object Compression

   This section defines the compression format for various Base objects
   associated with RPL ICMPv6 messages.

3.1.  Compressing the DODAG Information Object

         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        |C|I|L|V|R|G|T|F|  Ra   | Compr | Inline Fields
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

       Figure 1: The Compression Format for DODAG Information Object

   The format of a compressed DODAG Information Object (DIO) base object
   is shown in Figure 1 and consists of the following fields:

   o  C: This flag is set to 1 if the 3rd byte of the DIO contains an
      8-bit identifier of the "context" that provides values of all
      elided fields in the DIO base object and the options it contains.
      Otherwise, this flag is set to 0.  The description of the contexts
      in use in an LLN and how RPL nodes come to know of these contexts
      is out of scope for this document.

   o  I: This flag indicates whether the RPLInstanceID field is elided
      or not.  This flag is set to 1 if the RPLInstanceID field is
      present inline in the compressed DIO.  This flag is set to 0 if
      the RPLInstanceID field is elided.  In this case, the implicit
      value of the RPLInstanceID depends on the context if present.  In
      the absence of the context, the implicit value of the
      RPLInstanceID depends on the value of the L flag as discussed
      next.

   o  L: This flag is meaningful only when both C and I flags are 0,
      i.e. the RPLInstanceID field is elided but no context is
      identified.  In this case, the L flag is set to 1 if the elided
      RPLInstanceID is local and has implicit value 128.  The L flag is
      set to 0 if the elided RPLInstanceID field is global and has
      implicit value 0.  If either of C and I flag is set to 1, the L
      flag MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored on reception.

   o  V: This flag is set to 1 if the Version Number is carried inline
      in the DIO message.  The flag is set to 0 if the Version Number is
      elided.  In this case, the implicit value of the Version Number
      depends on the context if present.  If no context is present, the
      implicit value of the Version Number is assumed to be zero.

   o  R: This flag indicates whether the Rank field in the DIO is
      shortened or not.  This flag is set to 1 if the full 16-bit Rank
      is present inline in the compressed DIO.  The flag is set to 0 if
      the 4-bit long Ra field contains the rank value.

   o  G: This flag indicates whether the byte containing the Grounded,
      Mode of Operation and DODAG Preference fields is elided or not.
      This flag is set to 1 if the above-mentioned byte is carried
      inline.  The flag is set to 0, if this byte is elided.  In this
      case, the implicit values of Grounded, Mode of Operation and
      DODAGPreference fields depend on the context if present.  If no
      context is present, the implicit values of these fields are as
      follows:

      *  The Grounded flag has implicit value 0, i.e., the DODAG is not
         grounded.

      *  The Mode of Operation field has implicit value 0, i.e., the
         DODAG does not maintain any downward routes.

      *  The DODAG Preference field has implicit value 0, i.e., least
         preferred.

   o  T: This flag is set to 1 if the DTSN field is carried inline.  The
      flag is set to 0, if the DTSN field is elided.  In this case, the
      implicit value of the DTSN field depends on the context if
      present.  If no context is present, the implicit value of this
      field is assumed to be zero.

   o  F: This flag indicates whether the Flags and Reserved fields in
      the DIO are elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if these fields
      are carried inline.  The flag is set to 0, if these fields are
      elided.  In this case, the values of these fields depend on the
      context if present.  If no context is present, both fields are
      assumed to be zero.

   o  Ra: This field contains the 4-bit rank value if the R flag is set
      to 0.

   o  Compr: This field contains the number of prefix octets that are
      elided from the DODAGID field.  For example, the Compr value will
      be zero if full 16-octet DODAGID field is carried inline in the
      compressed DIO.

   o  Inline Fields: The context identifier, if present, occupies the
      3rd byte of the compressed DIO base object.  Any inline fields in
      the compressed DIO appear in the same order as in the uncompressed
      format defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

4.  Compressing the RPL Options

   This section defines the compression format for some of the RPL
   options that may be carried inside an RPL control message.  These RPL
   options SHOULD be compressed when carried inside an RPL control
   message compressed in the manner described in this document.  The
   other RPL options, for which a compression format is not specified in
   this document, MUST follow the format in which they are defined when
   carried inside an RPL control message compressed as described in this
   document.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+----------------


                Figure 2: Format of a Compressed RPL Option

   The compression format of an RPL option is shown in Figure 2.  It
   consists of:

   o  Option Type: The Option Type value for a compressed RPL option is
      same as that of the uncompressed option with the most significant
      bit (MSB) set to 1.

   o  Option Length: The Option Length is 8 bits long as in case of an
      uncompressed RPL option.

        Figure 3: Format of a Compressed DODAG Configuration Option

   The format of the compressed DODAG Configuration Option is shown in
   Figure 3.  The compressed DODAG Configuration option begins with an
   octet consisting of flags that specify whether the individual fields
   in the option are elided or not.  The implicit value of an elided
   field depends on the context identified in the DIO base object.  If
   DIO base object does not identify a context, the implicit value of an
   elided field is as specified below:

Internet-Draft     draft-goyal-roll-rpl-compression-00          May 2011


   o  F: This flag indicates whether the byte in the uncompressed DODAG
      Configuration option, consisting of the Flags, A and PCS fields,
      is elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if this byte is carried
      inline.  The flag is set to 0, if this byte is elided.  If the DIO
      base object does not contain a context, the implicit values of
      elided A and PCS fields are zero and DEFAULT_PATH_CONTROL_SIZE (as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]) respectively.

   o  T1: This flag indicates whether the DIOIntervalDoublings and
      DIOIntervalMin fields are elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if
      these fields are carried inline.  The flag is set to 0, if these
      fields are elided.  If DIO base object does not contain a context
      identifier, these fields, if elided, assume their default values
      as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   o  T2: This flag indicates whether the DIORedundancyConstant field is
      elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if DIORedundancyConstant is
      carried inline.  The flag is set to 0, if this field is elided.
      In this case, the field assumes its default value as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] if the DIO base object does not identify a
      context.

   o  I1: This flag indicates whether the MaxRankIncrease field is
      elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if this field is carried
      inline.  The flag is set to 0 if this field is elided.  In this
      case, the MaxRankIncrease field assumes its default value (as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]) if the DIO base object does not
      identify a context.

   o  I2: This flag indicates whether the MinHopRankInc field is elided
      or not.  This flag is set to 1 if this field is carried inline.
      The flag is set to 0 if this field is elided.  In this case, the
      MinHopRankInc field assumes its default value (as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]) if the DIO base object does not identify a
      context.

   o  O: This flag indicates whether the OCP field is elided or not.
      This flag is set to 1 if this field is carried inline.  The flag
      is set to 0 if this field is elided.  In this case, if the DIO
      base object does not identify a context, RPL Objective Function 0
      [I-D.ietf-roll-of0] is the OCP in effect.

   o  R: This flag indicates whether the byte marked as Reserved in the
      uncompressed format is elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if
      this byte is carried inline.  The flag is set to 0 if this byte is
      elided.  In this case, the Reserved byte is assumed to have value
      0.

   o  L: This flag indicates whether the Default Lifetime and Lifetime
      Unit fields are elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if these
      fields are carried inline.  The flag is set to 0 if these fields
      are elided.  In this case, the life time of the routes associates
      with this DODAG is infinity unless another value is specified in
      the context identified in the DIO base object.

   o  Inline fields: Any inline fields in the compressed DODAG
      Configuration option appear in the same order as in the
      uncompressed format.

   Note that a compressed DODAG Configuration Option can be as small as
   3 bytes, whereas an uncompressed DODAG Configuration Option is 16
   bytes long.

    Figure 4: Generic Format of a Compressed Routing Metric/Constraint
                                  Object

   A compressed Metric Container Option contains compressed Routing
   Metric/Constraint objects as defined in this document.  A compressed
   Metric Container Option MUST NOT contain uncompressed Routing Metric/
   Constraint objects defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].  The
   generic format of a compressed Routing Metric/Constraint Object is
   shown in Figure 4.  A compressed Routing Metric/Constraint Object
   always has a fixed size as defined in this document.  Thus,
   "recorded" metrics and sub-objects/TLV options within a metric object
   are not allowed.  Various fields inside a compressed Routing Metric/
   Container Object header are as follows:

   o  Type: The type of the routing metric/constraint object.

   o  C: This flag is set to one if the object represents a constraint.
      This flag is set to zero if the object represents a metric.

   o  O/P: If the object represents a constraint, this flag is set to
      one if the constraint is optional.  Otherwise, the flag is set to
      zero.  If the object represents a metric, this bit represents,
      along with P2 bit, a 2-bit "precedence" field.

   o  P2: This bit is relevant only when the object represents a metric.
      Along with the O/P bit, this bit forms a 2-bit "precendence" field

      to indicate the precedence of this metric relative to other
      metrics in the container.  The precedence values range from 0 to
      3, 0 being the highest precedence.

   o  A: This field is relevant only for metrics and indicates the
      manner in which the routing metric must be aggregated:

      *  A=0x00: The routing metric is additive

      *  A=0x01: The routing metric reports a maximum

      *  A=0x02: The routing metric reports a minimum

      *  A=0x03: The routing metric is multiplicative

   defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].  Node that the E-E field
   has been reduced from 8 bits to 4 bits.

                     Figure 10: Compressed ETX Object

   The compressed ETX object has Type value 5 and is shown in Figure 10.
   It consists of a 16-bit value, which has the same meaning and
   function as the ETX field inside ETX sub-object inside ETX object
   defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].


5.  Examples

   In this section, we compare the sizes of RPL control messages with
   and without the compression mechanism specified in this document.

5.1.  A DIO With A Configuration Option, A Route Information Option and
      A Metric Container

   Consider an uncompressed multicast DIO message that has a
   Configuration Option, a Route Information Option and a Metric
   Container with one ETX metric object and one ETX constraint object.
   This message consists of the following components:

   o  IPv6 header: A typical IPv6 header, compressed as per
      [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc], for a multicast DIO message consists of 5
      bytes as follows:

      *  2 byte LOWPAN_IPHC Base Encoding

      *  1 byte Context Identifier Extension

      *  1 byte Next Header

      *  1 byte Group ID to identify all-RPL-nodes multicast address.

   o  4 bytes for ICMP Type, Code and Checksum fields;

   o  24 bytes for DIO Base Object;

   o  16 bytes for DODAG Configuration Option;

   o  24 byte Route Information Option;

   o  14 bytes for Metric Container consisting of:

      *  2 bytes for Type and Option Length fields;

      *  6 bytes for ETX metric object (4 bytes header + 2 bytes body);

Internet-Draft     draft-goyal-roll-rpl-compression-00          May 2011


      *  6 bytes for ETX constraint object (4 bytes header + 2 bytes
         body).

   Thus, the total length of such a DIO is 87 bytes.

   The same message, when compressed in the manner described in this
   document, consists of:

   o  5 bytes of IPv6 header compressed as per [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc] in
      the manner described in the previous paragraph;

   o  4 bytes for ICMP Type, Code and Checksum fields;

   o  4 bytes of compressed DIO Base Object consisting of 2 bytes of
      header and 2 bytes for DODAGID (the best case scenario);

   o  3 bytes of compressed DODAG Configuration Option, including 2
      bytes for Type and Option Length fields;

   o  24 bytes of Route Information Option;

   o  8 bytes for Metric Container consisting of:

      *  2 bytes for Type and Option Length fields;

      *  3 bytes for ETX metric object (1 byte header + 2 bytes body);

      *  3 bytes for ETX constraint object (1 byte header + 2 bytes
         body).

   Thus, the total length of the compressed DIO is 48 bytes.

5.2.  A DIO With A Configuration Option, A Route Discovery Option and A
      Metric Container

   Consider an uncompressed multicast DIO message that has a
   Configuration Option, a Route Discovery Option (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl]) and a Metric Container with one ETX metric
   object and one ETX constraint object.  This message consists of the
   following components:

   o  5 bytes of IPv6 header compressed as per [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc] in
      the manner described in the previous section;

   o  4 bytes for ICMP Type, Code and Checksum fields;

   o  24 bytes for DIO Base Object;

Internet-Draft     draft-goyal-roll-rpl-compression-00          May 2011


   o  16 bytes for DODAG Configuration Option;

   o  26 bytes for Route Discovery Option consisting of:

      *  4 bytes for Type, Option Length and other fixed length fields;

      *  2 bytes for the Target address field;

      *  20 bytes for the Address vector (assuming 10 2-byte long
         elements).

   o  14 bytes for Metric Container consisting of:

      *  2 bytes for Type and Option Length fields;

      *  6 bytes for ETX metric object (4 bytes header + 2 bytes body);

      *  6 bytes for ETX constraint object (4 bytes header + 2 bytes
         body).

   Thus, the total length of such a DIO is 89 bytes.

   The same message, when compressed in the manner described in this
   document, consists of:

   o  5 bytes of IPv6 header compressed as per [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc];

   o  4 bytes for ICMP Type, Code and Checksum fields;

   o  4 bytes of compressed DIO Base Object consisting of 2 bytes of
      header and 2 bytes for DODAGID (the best case scenario);

   o  3 bytes of compressed DODAG Configuration Option, including 2
      bytes for Type and Option Length fields;

   o  26 bytes of Route Information Option;

   o  8 bytes for Metric Container consisting of:

      *  2 bytes for Type and Option Length fields;

      *  3 bytes for ETX metric object (1 byte header + 2 bytes body);

      *  3 bytes for ETX constraint object (1 byte header + 2 bytes
         body).

   Thus, the total length of the compressed DIO is 50 bytes.
