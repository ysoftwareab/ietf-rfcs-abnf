Abstract

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC 2461] assumes that the
   underlying link layer support native multicast while IEEE 802.16 is a
   point-to-multipoint network without bi-directional native multicast
   support.  Such a discordance between IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol
   and IEEE 802.16 network results in the on-link and multicast issues.
   This document defines a mechanism, IPv6 NDP Relay and Multicast
   Emulation, to solve these issues.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 NDP for CPA in IEEE 802.16          March 2006


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE 802.16][IEEE 802.16e] is a connection-oriented
   broadband wireless access(BWA) technology.  Down-stream in IEEE
   802.16 is a point-to-multipoint connection and thus it is possible to
   broadcast messages toward SS (Subscriber Station) from BS (Base
   Station).  However, up-stream is connected as point-to-point type.
   Therefore, SS is not capable of multicasting as well broadcasting.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (IPv6 NDP) [RFC 2461] aims to solve
   problems due to the interaction between nodes attached on the same
   link.  It is designed without dependence on a specific link layer
   technology, but assumes that the link layer technology support a
   native multicasting.  As mentioned above, IEEE 802.16 supports
   multicast and broadcast in down-stream.  However, the original aim of
   the multicast and broadcast is to transmit IEEE 802.16 MAC management
   messages for bandwidth allocation, not IP data.  Thus, IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery message on IEEE 802.16 cannot be delivered to neighboring
   hosts by means of multicast.

   IPv6 NDP messages have link-local scoped address as IP destination
   address.  It means those messages have to be delivered toward on-link
   any hosts.  However, when all SSs under same BS are configured with
   common IPv6 network prefix, IEEE 802.16 disagrees with IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery on the definition of on-link host.  This is because IPv6
   NDP determines the on-link host with assigned prefixs while up-stream
   in IEEE 802.16 is a point-to-point connection.  IEEE 802.16 does not
   allow direct communication among SSs even though each SS knows that
   other SSs are neighboring ones at the IP level.  Eventually, this
   discrepancy results in limitation of transmission coverage of IPv6
   NDP messages with link-local scoped address.

   Following the 3GPP model for IPv6 NDP [RFC 3314], Access Router (AR)
   may assign distinct subnet to each SSs.  In the case, IPv6 NDP can be
   deployed without any modification and some operations in IPv6 NDP
   such as Address Resolution and Neighbor Unreachability Detection may
   be unnecessary.  However, such a unique prefix allocation disallows
   network renumbering with prefix and cannot simplify network
   management.

   IPv6 over NBMA networks [RFC 2491] presents a general architecture
   for IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) network.
   Specifically, [RFC 2491] focuses on an NBMA network with SVC mode
   which utilizes dynamically managed point to point and point to
   multipoint call between both communication hosts.  On the other hand,
   IEEE 802.16 is employed as access network technology in most cases
   and thus does not provide communication between end hosts.
   Therefore, IEEE 802.16 cannot be referred to as NBMA network stated

   in [RFC 2491].

   This document presents a mechanism which can allocate a common
   network prefix to all SS under the same IPv6 link.  Through the
   mechanism, the standard IPv6 NDP can be applied to IEEE 802.16
   networks without modifying conventional host-side operation.

4.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Issues over IEEE 802.16

   This section summarizes issues when IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is
   employed over IEEE 802.16 under the condition all SSs are assigned
   with common prefix address.

4.1.  On-Link Issue

   The assignment of a common prefix to all SSs under a specific AR
   means locating them "on-link" in terms of IP packet transfer.  From
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis], IP node determines destinations are on-link
   by performing a longest prefix match against the prefix list.
   Therefore, SSs sharing common prefix can be said to on-link IP nodes.

   IPv6 NDP is a protocol to solve problems due to the interaction
   between on-link nodes and requires direct communication between them.

   By the way, IEEE 802.16 is a connection-oriented network.  Even
   though all data in IEEE 802.16 can be broadcasted to air shared to
   all SSs, only SS associated with the CID included in the data can
   receive the data.  The connection of IEEE 802.16 always ends at the
   BS.  There is no support from 802.16 MAC/PHY for the direct
   communication among SSs [I-D.jee-16ng-ps-goals] which results in the
   problem of locating SSs on-link in terms of IP packet transfer.

4.2.  Multicast Issue

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages excepting Redirect are destined for
   link-local scoped multicast address such as all-router multicast
   address, all-node multicast address, and solicited-node multicast
   address.

   However, there is no dedicated CIDs for multicasting IPv6 packet in
   IEEE 802.16.  Thus, any available traffic CID value needs to be
   allocated for multicasting IPv6 packet.

4.3.  IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer

   IEEE 802.16 defines two types of Convergence Sublayer (CS), IP CS and
   Ethernet CS.

   When IP CS is applied, BS and AR may need to be tightly coupled by
   physically or logically by tunneling mechanism like GRE Tunneling
   (Figure 1 and 2).  Therefore, IP packets which are destined for on-
   link IP nodes needs to be first transfered toward AR.  Special
   consideration is required on the AR in treating IPv6 NDP messages
   which have different destination forms like link-local unicast, link-
   local all-nodes multicast, link-local all-routers multicast and

   In case of Ethernet CS, IEEE 802.16 deployment architecture can be
   configured as shown in Figure 3.  Assuming Ethernet link between BS
   and AR, we can consider similar bridging function on BS to one on
   WLAN access point.  Additional bridging function on BS is to
   interpret the Ethernet header of packets received from SS and
   transmit the packets toward expected next node.  In Figure 3, such an
   next node can be another BS, another SS, or AR.

5.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Support over IEEE 802.16

   Following subsections provide a mechanism to handle the mentioned
   respective issues.  The mechanism may require explicit cooperation
   with IEEE 802.16 technology or enhanced bridge function on BS.  The
   mechanism will be described by case of CS type.

5.1.  IP Convergence Sublayer

5.1.1.  IPv6 NDP Relay

   By aforementioned "On-Link" issue, IEEE 802.16 does not support

   direct communication between on-link SSs.  Moreover, AR in IP CS case
   is always a next-hop neighbor even when SS sends data to on-link SSs
   and thus all data have to be sent to AR as mentioned in the section
   4.3.  As a result, the AR discards IPv6 NDP messages addressed link-
   local all-node multicast and solicited node multicast address because
   the messages do not intend for the AR.  Therefore, it is necessary to
   relay the restricted messages.

   Multicast Relaying Part (MRP) serves as packets relayer and is
   located in AR.  MRP over AR intercepts packets destined for the
   multicast addresses and then prepares packet relaying while passing
   those to upper layer.  Intercepting rule of MRP is different
   according to the case when IEEE 802.16 CS supports IPv6 over Ethernet
   or native IPv6.  In case of IP CS, MRP holds packets, which begin
   with FF02 in IPv6 address.  Note that the MRP does not intercept
   packets addressed FF02::2.  This is due to the assumption the AR
   serves as default router and there is no other router in the subnet.
   Table 1 shows IP multicast address types used in IPv6 NDP.

       +--------------------------------+--------------------------+
        xx:x is last 24 bits of a unicast IPv6 address.

                               Table 1


   When BS and AR are coupled as shown in Figure 1, AR should forward
   unicast packets destined for on-link host.  In the case, the packets
   must be transmitted again via the incoming interface and AR has to
   transmit Redirect message to sender whenever communication between
   on-link SSs occurs.  This problem can be issue in implementation of
   AR and MRP can treat the problem.

5.1.2.  Multicast Emulation

   This section describes how to transmit the packets with link-local
   scoped multicast address into IEEE 802.16 network.  We suggest

Internet-Draft       IPv6 NDP for CPA in IEEE 802.16          March 2006


   following two different approaches for the purpose of multicast
   emulation.

5.1.2.1.  Multicast Emulation using Common CID

   IEEE 802.16 enables multicast transmission in down-stream.  However,
   it is difficult to create and maintain CIDs for multicast because
   there can be manifold multicast sessions.  Therefore, this document
   defines Common CID (CCID) for transmitting multicast data.

   There is one unique CCID in BS and it is shared by all SSs served by
   the BS.  All SSs can receive data transmitted via the CCID and IPv6
   module in SSs see whether the multicast data are destined to
   themselves or not.

   Current IEEE 802.16 does not specify CID which can be shared by all
   SSs and used for IP data.  Following describes how to make CCID with
   existing MBS-CID.

   [IEEE 802.16e] proposes Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS), which
   presents media service to SSs using multicast or broadcast.  Under
   MBS architecture, each SS selects MBS contents and then configures a
   corresponding CID by the DSA procedure.  Such a CID for MBS is
   referred to as MBS-CID.  MBS-CID is one of transport CIDs and is
   shared by all SSs requesting same media content.

   CCID can be seen as a special type of MBS-CID.  CCID is allocated to
   BS and all SSs served by the BS utilizing a general DSA procedure in
   MBS for transmitting link-local multicast data.  For the assigning
   the CCID, we assume that service flow for link-local multicast is
   globally defined and the service flow is known to BS and all SSs.
   Once initialization between BS and SS is completed, they perform DSA
   procedure for creating the link-local multicast service flow.  The
   detailed process creating new service flow and updating CS for
   mapping of the service flow to CCID is outside scope of this
   document.

   BS transmits IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages relayed by MRP towards
   all SSs via the CCID.

5.1.2.2.  Multicast Emulation using Replicated Unicast

   The transmission using CCID allows IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages
   to be delivered only once per transmission.  However, it requires a
   new CID for multicast.  This section shows how to transmit IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery messages with existing unicast CID.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery message can be delivered by repeated unicast

Internet-Draft       IPv6 NDP for CPA in IEEE 802.16          March 2006


   transmissions towards SSs involved in the multicast address of the
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery message.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages with link-local all node multicast
   address should be sent to all SSs and thus they can be transmitted by
   replicated unicasts via all established CIDs on BS.

   In this context, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages with solicited-node
   multicast address should be transmitted by replicated unicasts via
   CIDs of corresponding SSs.  Thus, it is required to identify CIDs for
   solicited-node multicast addresses.

   Section 6.3.1.1 in [IEEE 802.16] states that a 48-bit universal MAC
   address of SS is used during the initial ranging process to identify
   connections to SS.  Solicited-node multicast address of SS can be
   derived by the MAC address.  As a result, BS can be aware of the
   solicited-node multicast addresses with the known MAC address of each
   SS and match the derived addresses with each CIDs.

5.2.  Ethernet Convergence Sublayer

5.2.1.  IPv6 NDP Relay

   In Ethernet CS type, MRP is located in BS.

   The MRP on BS intercepts packets destined for the multicast addresses
   from Ethernet CS.  The intercepted packets are relayed again toward
   other SSs served by the same BS while being passed to a bridge
   operation on the BS.

   The MRP intercepts packets, which begin with "33-33" in Ethernet
   address excepting packets addressed routers ("33-33-00-00-00-02").
   Table 2 shows Ethernet address corresponding to the multicast address
   types used in IPv6 NDP.

   Same as IP CS case.


6.  Consideration for alternative approaches

   There are a few ways to solve the IP "On-Link" issues over IEEE
   802.16 network without depending on the Multicast Relaying Part (MRP)
   proposed in this I-D.

6.1.  Proxy Neighbor Advertisements

   Through proxy neighbor advertisement, an AR in 802.16 network can
   accept NS packets on behalf of SS.  However, as noted from [I-D.ietf-
   ipv6-2461bis], this mechanism is not intended as a general mechanism
   to handle IP nodes, thus it needs more investigation in moving
   forward based on this scheme.

6.2.  Proxy DAD

   Proxy DAD can be implemented to AR or BS to guarantee the uniqueness
   of autoconfigured address which is based on the 48-bit MAC address.
   However, as noted from [RFC 3314], this proxy DAD function would
   increase the complexity and the amount of state to be kept in the AR.
   Also, the AR would need to determine when the temporary addresses are

Internet-Draft       IPv6 NDP for CPA in IEEE 802.16          March 2006


   IEEE 802.16e architecture supports a number of mandatory
   authorization mechanisms such as EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.

   [RFC 3971] specifies security mechanisms for NDP and defines securing
   NDP messages.

   Basically, our approach of using "MRP" enables SSs to exchange IPv6
   NDP messages directly without depending on any proxy function at the
   AR or BS.  Therefore, it has advantage in securing NDP messages by
   the mechanism specified from [RFC 3971].
