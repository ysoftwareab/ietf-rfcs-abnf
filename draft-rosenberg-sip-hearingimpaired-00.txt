Abstract

   This document outlines a set of services enabled by the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP), that allow for access to voice services by
   people who are hearing impaired. SIP has gained much attention as a
   tool for voice communications on the Internet. Therefore,
   considerations for universal access of its services are important.
   This document does not propose any extensions or new capabilities to
   SIP, but rather a set of services enabled by it.


1 Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] is used to initiate,
   modify, and terminate interactive sessions between sets of users.
   Often, these sessions are voice sessions, described by the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [2]. Unfortunately, not everyone is able

   to participate in voice sessions. In particular, people who are
   hearing impaired often cannot act as senders or recipients on a voice
   session. Within the Public Switched Telephone System (PSTN), services
   have been defined that allow for access to ciruit switched voice
   services by the hearing impaired. We believe it is important to offer
   these kinds of services in an IP context. In fact, the flexibility of
   SIP affords us the ability to improve on these services, and offer
   more extensive forms of universal service access to the hearding
   impaired.

   This document outlines a few possible services that enable universal
   access of voice sessions, initiated by SIP, to users who are hearing
   impaired. These services are generally enabled by baseline SIP [1],
   or through the use of the caller preferences specification [3]. No
   additional extensions are proposed here in order to support universal
   access.

2 Example Services and Call Flows

   We provide the following examples services and accompanying call
   flows:

        Redirect to IM: The caller has phone and IM client. The called
             party has a phone and IM client. The phone call is
             redirected to IM and both parties use IM to communicate.


        One-way speech to text translation service: The caller has only
             a phone. The called party has a text terminal to receive
             and a phone to send.  A relay service translates in one
             direction only from speech to text.


        One-way speech to sign language translation service: The caller
             has just a phone. The called party has a video terminal to
             receive and a phone to send. A relay service translates in
             one direction only from speech to video, with the video
             being a sign language representation of the speech.


        Two-way speech to text and text to speech with translation
             service: The caller only has a phone. The called party uses
             text both ways. A relay service translates in one direction
             from text to speech and from speech to text in the other
             direction. A computer can do the text to speech
             translation.

        Hearing impaired calling party calling through relay: The caller
             has text only. The called party only has a phone. A relay
             service translates in one direction from text to speech and
             from speech to text in the other direction. A computer can
             do the text to speech translation.

   Alerts are provided to the phone user that the other party is hearing
   impaired and if the case, a relay service is automatically inserted.

2.1 Redirect to IM

   One advantage of providing voice services through the Internet is the
   access to other IP services that can be used in conjunction with
   voice. In support of the hearing impaired, Instant Messaging (IM) is
   particularly useful. IM allows for instantaneous text messaging
   between IP connected users. Recent work has specified how IM service
   can be enabled by SIP [4].

   One way to use IM to support the hearing impaired is to redirect a
   voice call to an IM exchange (provided the caller supports IM). The
   service works as follows. A voice call is initiated by a PC or other
   terminal that supports IM. Indication of support for IM is done
   through the caller preferences specification [3], which allows the
   caller to indicate characteristics of URLs they are willing to be
   redirected to. In this case, they would indicate support of the
   MESSAGE method, used for instant messaging within SIP. Support for
   other instant messaging protocols, so long as they are described by
   standardized URL schemes, can also be indicated.

   When the call arrives at the user agent of the hearing impaired user,
   the UA checks for support of instant messaging. If such support is
   indicated, the UAS sends a 302 (Use IM - Hearing Impaired) redirect,
   containing a URL to be used for IM. This redirect is forwarded back
   to the calling party, whose IM tool pops up with an IM filled in with
   the address of the called party. The two can then participate in a
   pure IM session.

   The service can also be provided by an application server serving the
   hearing impaired user. The application server, upon receiving the
   INVITE, would initiate its own INVITE towards the hearing impaired
   user (without indicating any kind of media session). This has the
   effect of alerting (through a flashing light or some other means)
   that an incoming call is taking place. If accepted, the application
   server can then redirect the initial caller to send an IM to a
   preconfigured IM address.

   Figure 1 contains a call flow for the service assuming it is being
   provided by the called UA.

2.2 One-way Speech-to-text Translation Service

   An alternative approach is to use a relay, which is a person who can
   listen to the calling party, type up the text, and send it to the
   hearing impaired user either through instant messages or through text
   over RTP [5].

   In one variant on this service, a call is made to a hearing impaired
   person. If the hearing impaired user wishes to accept the call, they
   send a 183 (Using a Translator for Hearing Impaired) response to the
   call.

   The provisional response to the caller is used by the client to alert
   the caller to the fact that the called party is hearing disabled and
   that a relay service will be part of the call. This is useful to help
   the caller to tune the speaking style, so as to adjust for such a
   type of conmmunication.

   Then, after sending the 183, using the third party call control
   mechanisms [6], the called party launches a call to a translator,
   with that INVITE containing SDP that indicates support for only the
   RTP payload format for text messages. The response from the

Internet Draft            SIP Hearing Impaired             July 13, 2000


   translator (presumably accepting the call), contains SDP where the
   translator expects to receive audio to be translated to text. When
   this 200 OK arrives at the hearing impaired user, that SDP is placed
   into the 200 OK of the call. The result is that the caller will be
   sending media to the translator, and the hearing impaired user will
   receive a textual version of it over RTP. However, the hearing
   impaired user sends audio directly to the caller. Clearly, this
   service only works for users who are hearing impaired but not speech
   impaired. When this is the case, it has the advantage of sending the
   speech directly between the participants in the direction that is
   possible, reducing latency. Such an asymmetric service is not readily
   supported within the PSTN.

   The call flow for this service is depicted in Figure 2.

2.3 One-way Speech-to-Sign-Language Translation Service

   from a normal phone, makes a call to a hearing impaired user. The
   hearing impaired user establishes a connection with a translator
   service that will listen to speech and "convert" it to sign language.
   The sign language is sent to the hearing impaired used through a
   video stream.

   This service is accomplished identically to the one way speech to
   text translation service. The call flow is the same as listed in
   Figure 2. The only difference is that the SDP which indicates text,
   will instead indicate video. The RTP stream marked as containing
   text, will instead contain video.

2.4 Two-way speech to text and text to speech with translation service

   The service in the previous section can be extended to include one
   relay for speech to text and another that does text to speech (where
   the text is typed by the speech impaired user). The text to speech
   translation can be done by a computer. If people are used to
   translate in both directions, these translators may be the same
   person, but they need not be. This has the interesting effect of
   introducing some form of privacy. With two different translators,
   neither is privy to the complete conversation, and in all likelihood,
   would not be able to ascertain what is actually being talked about.

   A call flow for this variant on the service is shown in Figure 3.


   Messages F1, F2, F3 and F4 are the same as above. F5 is a standard
   ACK. F6 is:



   INVITE sip:text2speech@example.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP b.example.com
   From: sip:hiu@example.com

   CSeq: 88 INVITE
   Contact: sip:hiu@b.example.com
   Content-Type: application/sdp
   Content-Length: XX

   <SDP 1>



   and F7 looks like:

   CSeq: 88 INVITE
   Contact: sip:text2speech@d.example.com
   Content-Type: application/sdp
   Content-Length: XX

   <SDP 4 w/ RTP payload type for text>



   F8 is a standard ACK. F9 looks like F5 from the asymetric version of
   the service.

   Our approach also has the advtange that any application service
   provider can be used for these translation services. Different
   providers can be used for each direction, and these providers do not
   need to be affiliated in any way with the ISP providing IP services
   for the hearing impaired user. This provides for greater competition,
   and thus improved service.

   This approach also has the advantage of allowing one direction
   (speech to text), the other direction (text to speech), or both, to
   be performed by automated systems. For example, text to speech
   technology is fairly robust, and could be used in one direction,
   whereas a human operator could be used in the reverse (speech to
   text) direction, since speech recognition is not that robust. The
   call flow is completely identical, independently of whether the
   translation is done by human or machine. A machine would simply
   answer all calls to a specific address (sip:translator@asp.com), and
   echo the media (text or speech) back to the caller after conversion
   (conversion direction would be determined by the media capabilities
   indicated in the INVITE). In fact, there are other applications for
   such conversion systems. Providers of them could not only enable
   services for the hearing impaired, but other applications as well.
   Examples include voice browsing of the web, email to speech readout
   over phones, and instant message to voicemail services. In fact, the
   opposite direction is quite likely - providers that perform these
   services can reuse their systems, without any work, to also provide
   services to the hearing impaired.

2.5 Hearing Impaired Calling Party through Relay

   In this section, we consider a relay where the calling party is
   hearing impaired.

   This service works much like the one desribed above, relying on third
   party call control mechanisms. The caller sends an INVITE with SDP
   containing no codecs, targeted for the called party. If the called
   party accepts, the caller launches an INVITE to one or two
   translation services (depending on whether the caller is just hearing
   impaired, or both speech and hearing impaired). The INVITE to speech
   to text translation service contains SDP where the caller would like
   to receive the text; the response contains SDP that the caller places
   in the ACK to the called party. This connects the called party with
   the speech to text translator, with the resultant text being sent to
   the caller. If text to speech service is also needed, the caller
   places the SDP it received in the 200 OK from the called party into
   an INVITE to the translator. The response contains SDP with an
   address where the caller can send text.

   Figure 4 shows a call flow using only speech to text translation
   services.


3 Security Considerations

   Since the services described here rely on a person or machine to
   translate voice or text, there is an unavoidable trust relationship
   between the participants in the call and this service. As such,
   strict privacy of the conversation cannot be provided; the translator
   service needs to have access to the media stream. However, our
   approach of separating the text to speech and speech to text
   translator services affords some amount of privacy, as a single
   outside entity would not be privy to the entire conversation.
