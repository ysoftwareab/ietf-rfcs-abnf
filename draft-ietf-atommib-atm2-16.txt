   2. Abstract

   This memo defines objects used for managing ATM-based interfaces,
   devices, and services in addition to those defined in the ATM-MIB
   [24], to provide additional support for the management of:

        - ATM Switched Virtual Connections (SVCs)
        - ATM Permanent Virtual Connections (PVCs)

   3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [11].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
   STD
        16, RFC 1155 [14], STD 16, RFC 1212 [15] and RFC 1215 [16].  The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [17].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.
        The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
        SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [18] and RFC 1906 [19].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [19], RFC
        2272 [20] and RFC 2274 [21].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
        The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
        formats is described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
        in RFC 1905 [8].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [22]
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
        2275 [23].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are

   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This document specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
   A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

   4. Overview

   The purpose of this memo is to provide additional capabilities, not
   found in the ATM-MIB [24], which are needed to manage ATM interfaces.
   This memo addresses the following areas:

        - ATM Switch Support
        - ATM Service Support
        - ATM Host Support

   In addition, this memo also provides ATM trap support.

   4.1 Background

   In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB modules
   are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and cross-connects.
   Examples include MIB II for general system and interface management
   (RFC 1213 [3] and RFC 2863 [4]), the DS3 or SONET MIBs for management
   of SONET and DS3 physical interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB
   modules for applications that make use of ATM, such as SMDS [28] and
   LAN Emulation [27].  These MIB modules are outside the scope of this
   specification.

   This MIB module also requires the use of the ATM-MIB module defined
   in [24] and ATM-specific textual conventions defined in [34].

   ATM Endpoint applications such as ATM LAN Emulation or Classical IP-
   over-ATM Clients and Servers use ATM to establish SVC/PVC connections
   for exchanging control and data information. The agents of these ATM
   applications must provide the network manager with information on the
   SVC/PVCs in use and which applications are using them.  The
   information can be made generic so as to apply to all ATM
   applications.  This memo defines extensions to the ATM-MIB [24] in
   order to support this.

   The current specification of this supplemental ATM2-MIB is based on

   SNMPv2 SMI.

   4.2 Important Definitions

   The following terms are defined here and used throughout this MIB:
        - Virtual Path Link (VPL)
        - Virtual Path Connection (VPC)
        - Virtual Path Segment (VP Segment)
        - Virtual Channel Link (VCL)
        - Virtual Channel Connection (VCC)
        - Virtual Channel Segment (VC Segment).

   The figures on the next page show how these terms apply in typical
   ATM network topologies.  Additional terms relevant to this MIB are
   defined and illustrated in the ATM Terminology section 3 of [24].

   5.1.1 ATM SVC VP Cross-Connect Table

   This table provides the SVC VP Cross-Connect (SVPC) information.  The
   equivalent PVC VP Cross-Connect table is defined in [24].  This table
   also includes cross-connect information for Soft PVPs.

   This table contains configuration and state information of all SVC VP
   point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, or multipoint-to-multipoint VP
   cross-connects.

   This table has read-only access and can be used to monitor the
   cross-connects which connect the VPLs together in an ATM switch or
   network.  The atmSvcVpCrossConnectIndex is used to associate the
   related SVC VPLs that are cross-connected together.  The
   atmSvcVpCrossConnectRowStatus object has read-write access to allow
   for tear-down.

   The ATM SVC VP Cross-Connect Table models each bi-directional
   Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) VP cross-connect as a set of entries
   in the atmSvcVpCrossConnectTable.  A point-to-point VPC cross-connect
   is modeled as one entry; a point-to-multipoint (N leafs) VPC cross-
   connect as N entries in this table; and a multipoint-to-multipoint (N
   parties) VPC cross-connect as N(N-1)/2 entries in this table.  In the
   latter cases, all the N (or N(N-1)/2) entries are associated with a
   single VPC cross-connect by having the same value of
   atmSvcVpCrossConnectIndex.

   The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical ordering of
   the two interfaces associated with a VPC cross-connect.  That is, the
   ATM interface with the lower value of ifIndex is termed 'low', while

   the other ATM interface associated with the VPC cross-connect is
   termed 'high'.  This terminology is used to provide directional
   information; for example, the atmSvcVpCrossConnectL2HOperStatus
   applies to the low->high direction, and
   atmSvcVpCrossConnectH2LOperStatus applies to the high->low direction.

   5.1.2 ATM SVC VC Cross-Connect Table

   This table provides the SVC Cross-Connect (SVCC) information.  The
   equivalent PVC VC Cross-Connect table is defined in [24].  This table
   also includes cross-connect information for Soft PVCs.

   This table is used to model a bi-directional point-to-point, point-
   to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint SVC VC cross-connect.

   This table has read-only access and is used to monitor the cross-
   connects which connect the VCLs together in an ATM switch or network
   that belong to a VC connection.  The atmSvcVcCrossConnectIndex is
   used to associate the related SVC VCLs that are cross-connected
   together.  The atmSvcVcCrossConnectRowStatus object has read-write
   access to allow for tear-down.

   The ATM SVC VC Cross-Connect Table models each bi-directional
   Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) VC cross-connect as a set of entries
   in the atmSvcVcCrossConnectTable.  A point-to-point VC cross-connect
   is modeled as one entry; a point-to-multipoint (N leafs) VC cross-
   connect as N entries in this table; and a multipoint-to-multipoint (N
   parties) VPC cross-connect as N(N-1)/2 entries in this table.  In the
   latter cases, all the N (or N(N-1)/2) entries are associated with a
   single VPC cross-connect by having the same value of
   atmSvcVcCrossConnectIndex.

   the two interfaces associated with a VPC cross-connect.  That is, the
   ATM interface with the lower value of ifIndex is termed 'low', while
   the other ATM interface associated with the VPC cross-connect is
   termed 'high'.  This terminology is used to provide directional
   information; for example, the atmSvcVcCrossConnectL2HOperStatus

   5.1.3 ATM Interface Signalling Statistics Table

   This table provides statistical information of the signalling entity.
   A signalling entity can be deployed over an ATM interface as defined
   in the atmInterfaceConfTable [24], a logical ATM interface defined in
   section 6.3.10.1 in this document, or a proprietary virtual interface
   as described atmInterfaceExtTable.  To monitor the signalling entity,
   a few counters are provided.  They are defined as:

                     atmSigSSCOPConEvents
                     atmSigSSCOPErrdPdus

   5.1.4 ATM Signalling Capability Support

   A number of Information Elements may or may not be supported by ATM
   switches or ATM Service.  Hence, for trouble isolation it is
   important to keep track which particular Information Elements are
   supported.  The corresponding group of objects must be supported by
   switches or services supporting SVCs, and indicate whether the
   following Information Elements are enabled/disabled:

   1)   Calling party number

   2)   Calling party subaddress

   3)   Called party subaddress

   4)   Broadband high layer information

   5)   Broadband low layer information

   5)   Broadband Repeat Indicator

   7)   AAL parameters

   The last parameter, Preferred Carrier Pre-Subscription, identifies
   the carrier to which intercarrier calls originated from this
   interface are routed when transit network selection information is
   not provided by the calling party.

   5.1.5 Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table

   This table extends the ATM VCL table of the ATM-MIB [24] to include
   all other necessary signalling information as specified in the ATM
   Forum UNI Specifications [25] and [26].  A user can create an entry
   with all signalling parameters and later use that entry to specify
   the signalling characteristics of SVCs.

   Some of the signalling parameters such as the AAL5 parameters
   information element is reflected in the VCL and VPL tables, and this
   table only contains the remaining AAL5 parameters information.

   Signalling attributes can be grouped into following categories:

      1) ATM Adaptation Layer Parameters

      Information in this group are captured in the
      ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table defined
      in this memo.  Please refer to section 5.4.5.5 of
      [25] and [26].

      2) Broadband High Layer Information

      Information in this group are captured by the
      ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table defined
      in this memo.  Please refer to section 5.4.5.8 of
      [25] and [26].

      3) Broadband Low Layer Information

   5.1.6 ATM Interface Registered Address Table

   This table contains a list of ATM addresses that can be used for
   calls to and from a given interface by a switch or service.  The ATM
   addresses are either registered by the endsystem via ILMI or
   statically configured.  This table does not expose PNNI reachability
   information.  This table only applies to switches and network
   services.  See also Section 5.

   5.1.7 ATM VPI/VCI to Address Mapping Table

   In the atmVclAddrTable, the object atmVclAddrAddr can either be an
   ATM Local Address or an ATM Remote Address which represent the two
   endpoint addresses of a VCL.  ATM Local Address identifies the local
   endpoint of the VCL represented by this agent.  While, the ATM Remote
   address represents the address of the ATM application at the other
   end of the VCL.

   5.1.8 ATM Address to VPI/VCI Mapping Table

   This table provides an alternative way to retrieve the atmVclTable.
   This table can be used to retrieve the indexing to the atmVclTable by
   an ATM address.

   5.1.9 ATM VPL Statistics Table

   The atmVplStatTable includes per-VPL cell counters.  The VPL cell
   counters count the valid ATM cells.  The valid ATM cells include the
   user and OAM cells but exclude the physical layer (e.g., idle cells)
   and unassigned cells.  Cells coming into an ATM managed system are
   counted differently with the high Cell Loss Priority (CLP=0) or low
   Cell Loss Priority (CLP=1). The cells are tagged, passed or discarded
   depending on the incoming CLP value and the policed cell rate by the
   "traffic policing" entity in the ATM managed system.  Refer to [25]
   and [26] for the description of the traffic policing.

   In the switch where the traffic policing is not supported, cells are
   passed or discarded depending on the bandwidth and buffering capacity
   of the switching fabric.  The Output Tagged Cells counter, in this
   case, is always zero.

          Figure 5: ATM Cell Counters per VPL


   In this table, cells coming into and out of the managed ATM system
   are counted as the total number of cells and the cells with the
   CLP=0.  The CLP=1 counter is derived by subtracting CLP=0 cells from
   the total cells.  In addition, cells that are tagged on the output
   are also counted.  The output CLP=1 cells equals the total cells out
   count minus both the CLP=0 cells and the tagged cells.

   5.1.10 ATM VPL Logical Port Table

   The ATM VPL Logical Port Table includes all ATM logical port
   interface configuration information.

   5.1.10.1 ATM Logical Port Interface

   The interface type "ATM Logical Port" (ifType=80) is defined to allow
   the representation of a VP Tunnel, which is a VPL used as a trunk
   connection (most likely between devices that are not physically
   adjacent), providing for multiplexing and demultiplexing of VCs on
   the VP.  Figure 6 illustrates such a VP Tunnel.

   Note: the "ATM Logical Port" interface is more of a logical port,
   compared with an interface of type "ATM" which is more of a physical
   port that provides for the transport of many VP and VC connections
   between adjacent devices.

                    Figure 6: Virtual Path Tunnel


   In Figure 6, a VP tunnel (denoted as VPL1 by Switch A, and as VPL2 by
   Switch B) is used to connect VCL1 with VCL4 and VCL2 with VCL3.
   Figure 6 shows only one VP tunnel, but there can be multiple VP
   tunnels over the same physical interface.

   A particularly useful VP tunnel scenario is tunneling across a public
   network that does not support signalling.  In Figure 6 above, assume
   Switches A and B are private switches that signal over the VP to set
   up connections transparently through the public network.  The public
   network would just transport a PVC VP between the two switches.

   Because the VP Tunnel constitutes an interface between two ATM
   devices that are not necessarily physically adjacent, most of the
   management information pertaining to the interface may differ for the
   tunnel, including:

           - active VPI/VCI fields (the tunnel may be a subset
             of the parent interface).
           - maximum number of VCCs
           - configured VCCs
           - ILMI VPI/VCI values
           - ATM address type
           - ATM administrative address
           - received/transmitted cells.


   5.1.10.2 How to create an ATM Logical Port interface

   On ATM devices supporting VP tunnels, the ATM Logical Port Interface
   Table can be used to create VP tunnels.  To create an ATM Logical
   Port interface via SNMP:

       - Create a VPL (e.g., VPI=a on an existing ATM interface
         which has ifIndex=x) in the atmVplTable.

       - Set the object atmVplLogicalPortDef to isLogicalIf.
         A new row in the ifTable is then created by the agent,
         with ifIndex=y, to represent the ATM Logical Port
         interface.  The object atmVplLogicalPortIndex is also
         set to y by the agent to represent the ifIndex value of
         the ATM Logical Port interface.

       - The ifEntry values are set for the ATM Logical
         Port interface (ifIndex=y) as discussed in RFC
         1695, with the following exceptions:
             * ifType - a new enumerated value of atmLogical(80)

               and the ILMI on the VP.
             * ifInOctets, ifOutOctets - support of
               these objects is not mandatory for ATM
               Logical Port interfaces.

               beneath it.
             * ifInUnknownProtos - always zero, errors
               are specified for the atm cell-layer

               although VPCs cannot be setup on a VP tunnel.
             * atmInterfaceCurrentMaxSvpcVpi - VPI of VP tunnel,
               although VPCs cannot be setup on a VP tunnel.
             * atmInterfaceConfMaxSvccVpi - VPI of the VP tunnel.
             * atmInterfaceCurrentMaxSvccVpi - VPI of VP tunnel.
             * atmIntfPvcFailures - Includes failures of PVCLs
               within the VP tunnel, but not of the PVPL itself,
               since those are reported on the atm(37) interface.
             * atmIntfCurrentlyFailingPVpls - 0.
             * atmIntfPvcFailuresTrapEnable - Enables traps for
               PVCL failures within the VP tunnel, but not for
               the PVPL itself, since the latter are generated on
               behalf of the atm(37) interface.

       - An entry is created in the ifStackTable, with
         values: ifStackHigherLayer=y, ifStackLowerLayer=x.

   5.1.12 ATM VC General Information Table

   This table contains the general information for each VC.  It provides
   an index to the atmSigDescrParamTable defined in this MIB.  This
   table is an extension to the atmVclTable defined in the ATM-MIB [24].

   5.1.13 ATM Interface Configuration Extension Table

   The ATM Interface Configuration Extension Table contains ATM
   interface information that supplements the atmInterfaceConfTable
   defined in [24].  It includes the configuration information of the
   interface type (i.e., connection setup procedures) and ILMI.

   A network manager can configure the interface to run a specific type
   of connection setup procedures (i.e., protocol and version) such as
   ITU-T DSS2, ATM Forum UNI 3.1, PNNI 1.0 or BICI 2.0.  It can also
   dictate the role of the managed entity as one side of the interface.
   For example, if an interface is configured to run ATM Forum UNI 3.1,
   the managed entity has to be told to run as either the network side
   or the user side of the UNI.

   The objects atmIntfConfigType and atmIntfConfigSide are used for
   configuration and the objects atmIntfActualType and atmIntfActualSide
   are used for reading back the actual interface protocol and version.

   The following table describes all the valid combinations of
   configuration of the interface type and side.  Note that the value
   N/A meaning not applicable, should be set to the value other(1) when
   used.

   interface side since it should be a derived value.  The PNNI and BICI
   interfaces are always symmetric so setting the interface side is also
   not necessary.

   This table also includes the configured and negotiated maximum VPI
   value per ATM interface, and the configured and negotiated minimum
   VCI value per ATM interface.  Refer to [29] Sections 8.2.3.8 through
   8.2.3.10 for a detailed description.

   The following figure provides an example how the current minimum VCI
   values are derived from the configured minimum VCI values and the
   neighboring minimum VCI values:

            ifA:  Configured Min SVCC VCI = 32  (configured)
                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 40  (negotiated)

            ifB:  Configured Min SVCC VCI = 40  (configured)
                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 40  (negotiated)

            ifC:  Configured Min SVCC VCI = 32  (configured)
                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 32  (negotiated)

            ifD:  Configured Min SVCC VCI = 32  (configured)
                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 32  (negotiated)


        Between ifA and ifB, the maximum of the two vales for
        atmInterfaceConfMinSvccVci is 40, so both interfaces set
        their atmInterfaceCurrentMinSvccVci values to 40.  On
        the other hand, since ifC and ifD both are configured
        with atmInterfaceConfMinSvccVci values of 32, they set
        their atmInterfaceCurrentMinSvccVci values to 32.

    - An ATM switch X has three interfaces if1, if2 and if3.
    - There are two ATM network services offered, a1.a2...aN and
      b1.b2...bN, where a1.a2...aN is an object identifier used to
      identify the first service, and b1.b2...bN is the object
      identifier for the other service.
    - The first service is available at the ATM address 'a'.
    - The second service is available at the ATM address 'b'.
    - The first service can be used by any device connecting to
      the switch X.

   represented by atmIlmiSrvcRegServiceID, the ATM addresses a and b are
   represented by atmIlmiSrvcRegATMAddress, the values m, n, and p are
   arbitrary non-zero integer parameters (necessary in this example to
   differentiate the two entries for b1.b2...bN that are both available
   at the ATM address 'b') represented by atmIlmiSrvcRegAddressIndex,
   and the available interfaces are represented by atmIlmiSrvcRegIndex,
   where the special value 0 indicates any ATM interface.

   When querying the ILMI service registry table, through the ILMI
   protocol:  - the device attached to interface if1 will obtain the
     address a and b.  - the device attached to interface if2 will
   obtain the
     address a only.  - the device attached to interface if3 will obtain
   the
     address a and b.


   5.1.15  ILMI Network Prefix Table

   A table specifying per-interface network prefix(es) supplied by the
   network side of the UNI during ILMI address registration.  When no
   network prefixes are specified for a particular interface, one or
   more network prefixes based on the switch address(es) may be used for
   ILMI address registration.

   5.1.16  ATM Switch Address Tabl"

   This table contains one or more ATM endsystem addresses on a per-
   switch basis.  These addresses are used to identify the switch.  When
   no ILMI network prefixes are configured for certain interfaces,
   network prefixes based on the switch address(es) may be used for ILMI
   address registration.

   5.1.17  AAL5 per-VCC Statistics Table

   This table contains the AAL5 statistics for the VCCs.

   5.1.18  ATM VP Cross-Connect Extension Table

   This table extends the atmVpCrossConnectTable defined in ATM-MIB
   [24].

INTERNET-DRAFT      Supplemental ATM Managed Objects   February 11, 2001


   This table extends the atmVcCrossConnectTable defined in ATM-MIB
   [24].

   5.1.20  Currently Failing PVPL Table

   This table contains all the PVPLs that are in trouble.

   5.1.21  Currently Failing PVCL Table

   This table contains all the PVCLs that are in trouble.

   5.1.22  Leaf Initiated Join Counter support

   Two counter objects are added to count the number of leaf intiated
   setup requests and setup failures.

   5.2  Network and User Addresses

   At the user side of a given ATM UNI interface there may be an
   address, "ifPhysAddress", to identify the interface.  In addition,
   there may be several other addresses which can be used to originate
   and receive calls.  These other addresses that are used to receive
   calls are listed in the "ifRcvAddrTable" defined in RFC 2233 [19].
   The registered addresses on the network side are listed in the ATM
   Registered Address Table.  The ATM Registered Address Table is
   supported by switches and network services.  It is not supported by
   hosts.

   5.3 Configuration of VPLs, VCLs, and Cross-Connects

   The ATM Managed Objects needed to support the configuration of VPLs,
   VCLs, and Cross-Connects of the Permanent VPLs and VCLs are defined
   in the ATM-MIB [24].  Cross-Connects of the Switched VPLs and VCLs
   are defined in this memo.

   5.4 ATM-related Trap Support

   Traps are defined to detect changes in the status of permanent VPLs
   and VCLs.  The current up/down status of each permanent VPL or VCL is
   indicated by the atmVplOperStatus or atmVclOperStatus object,
   respectively.  Several tables and objects and one trap are defined in
   order to help network managers quickly and efficiently detect changes
   in the status of permanent virtual links.  Through use of these
   tables, objects, and traps, the time consuming and resource intensive
   task of continuously polling each row in the entire atmVplTable and
   atmVclTable can be avoided.

   The atmIntfPvcFailures counter and the atmIntfCurrentlyFailingPVpls

INTERNET-DRAFT      Supplemental ATM Managed Objects   February 11, 2001


   and atmIntfCurrentlyFailingPVcls gauges provide a quick means of
   determining the status of all PVPLs and PVCLs on an interface.  The
   atmCurrentlyFailingPVplTable and the atmCurrentlyFailingPVclTable
   list all of the problematic PVPLs and PVCLs, respectively, allowing
   them to be quickly identified.

   The atmIntfPvcFailuresTrap is generated just after a PVPL or PVCL on
   a particular interface leaves the `up' operational state.  Managers
   can then determine which PVPLs and/or PVCLs are failing by reading
   the atmCurrentlyFailingPVplTable and the
   atmCurrentlyFailingPVclTable.  Generation of the
   atmIntfPvcFailuresTrap is rate limited by suppressing all traps that
   would occur within atmIntfPvcNotificationInterval of a previous trap
   for the same interface.  Managers should continuously poll the tables
   and objects mentioned above for at least this amount of time in order
   to keep up with the state of the network.

   module.

10. Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
negative effect on network operations.

Many managed objects in this MIB
contain information that may be considered
sensitive since they contain interface configuration
information.
It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the
View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Supplemental ATM Managed Objects   February 11, 2001


It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
configured to give access to the objects only to those
principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
SET (change/create/delete) them.
