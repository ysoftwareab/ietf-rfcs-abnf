Abstract

  Internet fax [1,2] defines a way to send fax data over the Internet
  using e-mail.  But there is a clear desire, particularly on the
  part on non-technical users, for a service that more closely
  emulates the operational characteristics of traditional fax [3].

  This document sets out some goals for such a service, and
  introduces related terminology where needed.  The memo "Terminology
  and Goals for Internet Fax" [4] is used as a baseline for this
  memo.

1. Introduction

  The transmission and reception of final form documents (i.e.
  presented in a form that describes their final rendering) is an
  essential global communications service.

  Several protocols and services have been developed over the years
  to facilitate document transmission, including the GSTN Fax
  service, ITU-T T.30 [3].

  Within the IETF several protocols have been developed that
  facilitate document transmission, including Internet fax [1,2]
  (using e-mail protocols) and the Internet Print Protocol [5] (using
  elements from HTTP).  But there is a clear desire, particularly on
  the part on non-technical users, for a service that more closely
  emulates the operational characteristics of traditional fax [3].

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


  This document sets out some goals for such a service, and
  introduces related terminology where needed.  The memo "Terminology
  and Goals for Internet Fax" [4] is used as a baseline for this
  memo.

  These goals are intended to facilitate the use of quality document
  transfer in compliance with the legal as well as general custom and
  practice surrounding document transmission

1.1 Organization of this document

  This document uses "Terminology and Goals for Internet Fax" [4] as
  a baseline, and describes goals for quality document transfer in
  terms of additions and differences from that document.

  Section 2 introduces new terminology that is generaly useful in
  discussion of quality document transfer.

  Section 3 discusses operational modes for quality document
  transfer.

  Section 4 describes the goals for quality document transfer.  It
  starts with a brief listing of all the goals, then proceeds to
  explain in more detail those that are not described elsewhere.

1.2 Document conventions

  This memo uses the annotations described in "Terminology and Goals
  for Internet Fax" [4] to indicate levels of desirability for a
  quality document transfer protocol:

  {1}  there is general agreement that this is a critical
       characteristic of any definition of a quality document
       transfer protocol.

  {2}  most believe that this is an important characteristic of a
       quality document transfer protocol.

  {3}  there is general belief that this is a useful feature of a
       quality document transfer protocol, but that other factors
       might override;  a definition that does not provide this
       element is acceptable.

       NOTE:  Comments like this provide additional nonessential
       information about the rationale behind this document, and
       may help those who wish to understand the ideas in
       greater depth.

2. Terminology

  [[[TBD]]]

  Watermarking
            commonly refers to the addition of marks to each page of
            a facsimile transmission.  These marks are typically
            placed at the top of each page by the sender's terminal
            device or software application, and may contain
            time/date, sender identification and page number.  The
            recipient output device does not modify the document once
            it is received.


3. Operational modes

  RFC 2542 [4], section 2.5, discusses operational modes for Internet
  fax.  (The intent of "session" mode, described there, is to provide
  a timely delivery without being constrained by the kind of rigid
  protocol timing constraints that are normal when using a circuit
  based protocol like T.30.)

  For the purposes of this memo, the following operational mode
  definitions are used:

  o  "Store and forward", per RFC 2542.

  o  "Timely delivery" means that a document is delivered, and any
     confirmation is returned, reliably and within a predictable
     period of time that is short enough to be useful for the purposes
     of routine communications.






Klyne & Shockey            Work-in-progress                   [Page 4]

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


  o  "Prompt delivery" means that a document is delivered, and any
     confirmation is returned, in little longer that it takes to
     actually transmit the document data.  That is, for a moderately
     sized document the sender might be expected to wait for
     completion of the transfer.

  o  "Real time" means that delivery is completed within some defined
     maximum time delay, or the process of delivery is deemed to have
     failed.  Traditional Group 3 facsimile is a real time service in
     this sense.  True real time behaviour can be difficult to achieve
     reliably in the global Internet.


4. Goals for High Quality Document Distribution

       [[[It's not clear to me whether we want to separate
       specification requirements from "operational goals" and
       "functional goals", as in RFC2542.  I think we should see
       what material we generate for this.]]]

  These are:

  o  {1} timely delivery

  o  {1} proof of delivery (receipt)

  o  {1} date and time information

  o  {1} data format support

  o  {1} quality of output

  o  {1} capabilities exchange

  o  {1} addressing support

  o  {3} legal identity exchange

  o  {3} legal issues

  o  {2} cover pages

  o  {1} security

  o  {3} support for third party operation

  o  {2} interworking with other services





Klyne & Shockey            Work-in-progress                   [Page 5]

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


  o  {3} it is desirable that a quality document transfer protocol
     standard support and facilitate universal messaging systems
     (described in RFC 2542, section 2.4.5 [4]).

  o  {3} if QUALDOCS requires additions to the operational environment
     (services, firewall support, gateways, quality of service,
     protocol extensions), then it is preferable if those additions
     are useful for other applications.

  o  {3} features shared with other messaging applications (voice
     mail, short message service, paging, etc.) are desirable, so as
     not to require different operational changes for other
     applications.

4.1 Timely delivery

  QUALDOCS is intended for delivery of documents where there may be a
  strong user requirement for timeliness, with some guarantees that
  if transmission begins at all, it will complete quickly.  For
  example, it is a common practice to fax documents for discussion to
  other participants in a telephone conference call just prior to the
  call.

  QUALDOCS must provide for delivery of a document immediately, or
  very soon after it is transmitted.  "Very soon" means within a
  period of time that a human user might reasonably wait for delivery
  to be completed (e.g. less than a minute).

4.2 Proof of delivery/receipt

  Detailed progress reports and transaction logs have become standard
  end user requirements for a facsimile service in order to document
  the receipt and confirmation of facsimile delivery.

  Any report from the facsimile service:

  o  MUST note status (SUCCESS, FAILURE, CAUSE OF FAILURE)

  o  MUST note date and time of all attempts (log files recorded at
     each end by client and server locally)

  o  MAY note the duration of the transaction

  o  MAY note the number of document pages transferred

  o  SHOULD mutually exchange and document the identity of sender and
     recipient.





Klyne & Shockey            Work-in-progress                   [Page 6]

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


  Traditional facsimile uses real-time monitoring and signalling to
  indicate to the sender when a document transmission has completed,
  or report on any errors encountered.

  Extended Internet fax service proposals [2] recommend the use of
  DSN and MDN [19,20,15] for confirmation of delivery and receipt.

       NOTE:  a considerable body of market survey research
       indicates that confirmation of delivery or receipt is the
       feature that people most like about traditional
       facsimile.  Some feel that the non-universal deployment
       of DSN, and the possibility of refusing an MDN request,
       is holding back market acceptance for some Internet fax
       services;  they therefore believe that something
       different needs to be devised that more closely
       approximates the "look and feel" of existing fax and has
       the ability to be quickly extended in the future.

4.3 Date and time information

  Closely associated with the need for transaction receipt and
  notification is the legal requirement (see "Legal issues") that at
  least the first page of a facsimile contain the time and date of
  transmission and that information be included in any facsimile
  service record.

  Facsimile terminal devices all have internal clock devices for
  recording the time/date of transactions.  Actual time information
  is not exchanged "on the wire".  Each device notes when it sends
  and receives documents and logs those transactions appropriately.

  All Internet fax transactions note time/date information in the
  e-mail header information.

  QUALDOCS systems must implement clocks in their systems, or
  consider the use one of the time protocols RFC 867, RFC 868, RFC
  1305 or RFC 2030 [22,23,24,25], to obtain time/date information for
  transaction logging.

  Examples of transaction information that may be useful to record
  include:
     - time of transmission by sender
     - time of reception by receiver
     - time that rendering (e.g. printing) is completed

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


4.4 Data format support

  Facsimile and general messaging take fundamentally different
  approaches to the payload of a message.  Facsimile restricts its
  content to image files (specified by T.30, T.4 and T.6 [3,9,10] for
  Group 3 fax, or TIFF-FX [11] for Internet fax).  General messaging
  typically allows any form of data to be transferred, leaving it to
  the receiver to accept or reject it.

  The approach of facsimile is justified by the the goal of service
  interoperability.

  In order to facilitate interoperability between QUALDOCS and other
  facsimile services, all systems should support a file format that
  can be exchanged with other facsimile services, and negotiation of
  media features.

4.5 Quality of output

  It is a fundamental goal of QUALDOCS that not only is the
  information content of a document transferred, but also that high
  presentation quality can be achieved (subject the the receiver's
  capabilities).

  Received documents should be capable of presentation that allows
  them to be used directly in the same ways that a locally prepared
  document might be used.  (Contrast with traditional facsimile,
  which typicaly does not provide an image one would choose to use
  directly in a company report.)

4.6 Capabilities exchange.

  Traditional fax devices negotiate and exchange capabilities using
  the T.30 protocol.  Capability information is passed using defined
  data formats, including such attributes as page size, resolution,
  speed of transmission and identity of terminal devices (T.30-CSID).

  Mechanisms and data formats are available for Internet fax systems
  to communicate this capability information [15,16,17,18].

4.7 Addressing support

  In order for QUALDOCS to interoperate with other facsimile services
  and gateway between them it will be necessary for systems to have a
  way to pass GSTN FAX numbers [12], or e-mail addresses [13,14]







Klyne & Shockey            Work-in-progress                   [Page 8]

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


4.8 Legal identity exchange

  The identity of senders and recipients in traditional facsimile are
  achieved through the legal requirements for fax (see LEGAL ISSUES)
  and the exchange of T.30 CSID frames between terminal devices.

  IFAX uses e-mail header information to identify the sender to the
  recipient.  The recipient has no requirement to exchange
  identification data.

  QUALDOCS should define a mechanism for achieving this kind of
  exchange of identity between the sender and receiver.

4.9 Legal issues

  The United States Federal Communication Commission regulations and
  US Federal Law (47 USC 227) state:

     "Identification Required on Fax Messages

     The FCC's rules require that any message sent to a fax machine
     must clearly mark on the first page or on each page of the
     message:
     o the date and time the transmission is sent;
     o the identity of the sender; and
     o the telephone number of the sender or of the sending fax
       machine.

     All fax machines manufactured on or after December 20, 1992 and
     all facsimile modem boards manufactured on or after December 13,
     1995 must have the capability to clearly mark such identifying
     Information on the first page or on each page of the
     Transmission."

  Of particular note is that there is no requirement that the marks
  for identifying information be placed on every page.  The legal
  requirement is only for the first page, though it has become custom
  and practice among all FAX device manufacturers to include the
  "watermark" on each page transmitted.

  It is believed that some other nations have legal requirements for
  FAX similar to those in the United States.

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


4.10 Cover page

  Closely associated with the legal issues are the formats and
  requirements for cover pages.

  QUALDOCS should provide a mechanism to include cover page
  information that conforms to the legal or general custom and
  practice applied to facsimile services, when such information is
  not already part of the document being sent.

  To satisfy legal requirements for Facsimile transmission cover
  pages:
     o MUST contain identification of Sender:
     o SHOULD contain identification of Recipient:
     o MUST contain time/Date of Transmission:
     o MAY contain number of pages in Transmission:
     o MAY contain an area for short comments:

  Workstation software, when operating in a facsimile service mode,
  should offer cover page generation options and may offer other
  features, as deemed appropriate.

  If possible, cover page information should be distinguishable from
  message payload data (e.g. see the cover page proposal for Internet
  fax [21]).

4.11 Security

  Security here encompases a number of inter-related issues.

  o  Privacy:  not disclosing private information about a user's
     affairs, either through disclosure of confidential message
     content, or my disclosure of a user's actions and preferences in
     sending or receiving a document.

  o  Authenticity:  not providing information that would mislead a
     user into incorrectly believing a message has been received from
     or by some identified person.

  o  Integrity:  ensuring that messages received are a faithfull
     rebdition of what was sent.

  o  Non-repudiation:  for confirmation of document receipt to be made
     available that provides some basis for demonstrating that the
     message was properly delivered to its intended recipient.

  o  Availability:  robust operation in the face of attempts to
     prevent the normal transfer of documents.

Internet Draft     Terminology and Goals for Quality Document Transfer
8 Septemper 1999


  On the surface, it would seem that no one would want to make their
  printer available on the Internet.

  It should be noted, however, that we have globally accessible
  printers available now, called fax machines.  If the issues
  mentioned above are adequately addressed and documented, this
  external availability can be extended to a wider range of devices.

4.12 Support for third party operation

  In some environments, it may be desirable to hand off delivery of a
  document to some third party and report back (a) the fact that the
  hand-off has occurred, and (b) subsequent indication from the third
  party that delivery has indeed been effected.

  An example of this kind of scnario would be a service that received
  documents electronically, printed them, then obtains a signature
  when delivering the physical document.

4.13 Interworking with other services

  If a QUALDOCS system operating in a facsimile service mode is
  unable to send a TIFF-FX or appropriate GSTN fax file format but
  wishes to gateway to another facsimile service then the gateway
  system must be able to convert the available document data to the
  format required by the facsimile service.

  Choice of baseline formats and capabilities should take account of
  other services with which QUALDOCS systems may be required to
  interwork.


5. Internationalization considerations

  Quality document transfer must be regarded as a global service, and
  any specification must have consideration for:

  o  {1} transferring documents whose contents are expressed in a
     variety of national symbol sets.

  o  {2} transferring documents whose contents are expressed in a
     variety of national languages (in some cases, the language of the
     content may be important to its rendering;  e.g. text-to-speech
     processing).

  o  {3} document transfer destination adressess that may be expressed
     in a variety of national symbol sets (e.g. the names of a person
     to whom a document is addressed).

       NOTE:  There are a number of documents covering
       internationalization issues:  RFC 2130 [6], RFC 2277 [7]
       and others [8].


6. Security considerations

  This document describes the goals for the Internet Fax protocol,
  including the security goals.  An Internet Fax protocol must {1}
  address the security goals and provide adequate measures to provide
  users with expected security features.
