Internet-Draft      IP Transmission over IEEE 802.16       November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly has granted approval of an update
   to Recommendation ITU-R M.1457 that includes a new radio interface
   "IMT-2000 OFDMA TDD WMAN" which is based on IEEE 802.16 standard.

   The [IEEE802.16] standards specify two modes for sharing wireless
   media.  One is point-to-multipoint(PMP) and the other is mesh.  It
   has started public service based on PMP modes with one of the IEEE
   802.16 profiles.  In PMP mode, uplink supports only unicast while
   downlink supports both unicast and multicast.

   The [IEEE802.16] standards specify service specific convergence
   sublayer (CS) to process higher-layer protocol data unit based on
   classification.  The types of service specific CSs are asynchronous
   transfer mode (ATM) and packets such as IPv6, IPv4, IEEE 802.3/
   Ethernet, IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, IPv6 over IEEE 802.3/Ethernet, IPv6 over
   IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, IPv4 over IEEE 802.3/Ethernet, IPv4 over IEEE
   802.1Q VLAN and so on.

   This document describes IEEE 802.16 based Internet access with PMP
   mode based IP CS.  IPv4 CS is IPv4 packet [RFC0791] and IPv6 CS is
   IPv6 packet [RFC2460] in the frame payload of IEEE 802.16
   respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 'RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   o  Access Control Router (ACR):A generalized equipment sets providing
      connectivity, management, and control between the mobile station
      (MS) and Internet.  It is defined by TTA for the first hop router
      for MS.

   o  Access Service Network Gateway (ASNG):A generalized equipment sets
      providing connectivity and management between the mobile station
      (MS) and Internet.  It is defined by WiMAX Forum.

   o  Base Station (BS):A generalized equipment sets providing
      connectivity, management, and control between the MS and the ACR.

   o  Connection Identifier(CID): A 16 bit value that identifies a
      connection between MS and BS.

Internet-Draft      IP Transmission over IEEE 802.16       November 2007


   o  Convergence Sublayer (CS): Sublayer in the IEEE 802.16 MAC layer
      that classifies higher layer data and associates them to the
      proper MAC service flow identifier and connection identifier.

   o  Host Based Packet Delivery (HBPD): A generalized function of
      packet delivery at the access network such as local area network.

   o  IEEE 802.16: IEEE802.16 standards including IEEE802.16e standards.

   o  Internet Protocol (IP): A network layer protocol both IPv4
      [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460].

   o  Internet Protocol version 4 for Convergence Sublayer (IPv4 CS):
      IPv4 packet as a IEEE 802.16 payload that SHOULD set the bit #1
      for type 7 in REG-REQ and REG-RSP message.  The BS SHOULD set the
      value 1 for type 28 in DSx-REQ message to deliver IPv4 packet
      between MS and BS during the network entry procedure.  The DSx
      stands for dynamic service addition, change, deletion.  The MS
      SHOULD include the same TLV by DSx-RSP message.  A BS and MS
      SHOULD maintain one service flow for IPv4 classification rules at
      least.

   o  Internet Protocol version 6 for Convergence Sublayer (IPv6 CS):
      IPv6 packet as a IEEE 802.16 payload that SHOULD set the bit #2
      for type 7 in REG-REQ and REG-RSP message.  The BS SHOULD set the
      value 2 for type 28 in DSx-REQ message to deliver IPv6 packet
      during the network entry procedures.  The MS SHOULD include the
      same TLV by DSx-RSP message.  A BS and MS SHOULD maintain two
      service flow for IPv6 classification rules at least.


3.  Review of an IEEE 802.3 based IP Network

   This section briefly reviews IEEE 802.3 based IP network to consider
   network architecture and packet delivery mechanism.

   Figure 1 depicts conceptual IP network with [IEEE802.3].  T is a
   terminal equipment that has an IEEE 802.3 network interface.  T1
   stands for terminal 1 and T2 stands for terminal 2 and Tn is n-th
   terminal.  ER is an edge router that interconnects between IEEE 802.3
   network and Internet.  CH stands for correspondent host.

   An IEEE 802.3 network shares prefix information for IP routing to
   reduce routing information.  The prefix length [RFC4632] set by
   network mask.  It can be calculated when the n terminals are
   connected to the IEEE 802.3 network.

   Prefix Length = truncate ((log2 (n+2)) + 1)

   This prefix information SHOULD be same T1, T2, Tn and 802.3 interface
   of ER.  An IP packet is forwarded from CH to ER based on prefix
   routing mechanism such as OSPF, IS-IS in the intra-AS, BGP for
   inter-AS in the Internet.  This routing mechanism is named for
   'prefix based routing (PBR)' in this document.

   When the CH communicates with T1, received packet from CH SHOULD
   forwarded to T1 at ER.  ER performs ARP [RFC0826] for this purpose
   and maintain ARP cache table.  This packet transmission mechanism
   from ER to T1 called 'L2 forwarding' in this document.  L2 forwarding
   means that ER uses layer 2 frame to transmit layer 3 packet.  This is
   a kinds of HBPD in the IEEE 802.3 network compared to PBR in the
   Internet.

   The IEEE 802.3 is an access network and Internet is a backbone
   network in the network architecture viewpoint.  The access network is
   between end terminals and first hop router.  ER is a first hop router
   in the IEEE 802.3 network.  In general, access network SHOULD support
   HBPD considering other access network such as digital subscriber line
   (DSL), point to point protocol (PPP) and so on.  The IEEE 802.16
   network is one of the access network for Internet.  The access
   network for Internet SHOULD support HBPD and Internet supports PBR.


4.  IEEE 802.16 based IP Network

   Figure 2 depicts conceptual IP network with IEEE 802.16.  MS is a
   mobile station that has an IEEE 802.16 network interface.  BS stands
   for base station that supports IEEE 802.16 protocols.  It controls
   MSs and manages radio resources with ACR.  ACR stands for access
   control router that interconnect between IEEE 802.16 network and
   Internet.  It SHOULD provide ER functions and SHOULD be support BS
   interface functions of radio resource management.  Therefore, an ACR
   has additional functions compared with an ER.

   The IEEE 802.16 network for fixed/nomadic deployment can use shared
   prefix that is similar to IEEE 802.3 network.  In case of IEEE 802.16
   network supports mobility function, it does not depend on the prefix
   shares or not.  Because a packet forwarding mechanism for HBPD MAY
   use either L2 forwarding or IP based tunnel in the IEEE 802.16
   network.

              Figure 2: Internet connection with IEEE 802.16

   An MS SHOULD performs network entry procedures to connect IEEE 802.16
   network whereas IEEE 802.3 network does not have explicitly required
   connection procedures.

   The BS and MSs negotiate and configure parameters such as radio
   frequency, synchronization for physical layer frame, duplex method,
   power level, modulation and demodulation scheme, CS types and so on
   during the network entry procedures.  When network entry procedures
   are completed, BS maintains connection identifier (CID) and media
   access control (MAC) address for each MS.  Also, the BS reports
   required such information as CID, MAC, CS type and IP address to
   connected ACR.

4.1.  Requirements for HBPD in IEEE 802.16 Networks

   After the successful network entry procedures at MS, network
   equipment SHOULD maintain following information.  The ACR is a first
   hop router for MS.

   The MS requires following functions.

   R1:  The each MS SHOULD maintain CID and IP address.

   The BS requires following functions.

   R1:  The BS SHOULD maintain a pair of CID and IP address of MSs that
        connected BS.

   R2:  The BS SHOULD maintain a pair of MAC address and IP address of
        ACR that connected BS.

   R3:  The BS MAY maintain a pair of CID of MSs and GRE key managed by
        ACR that connected BS.

   R4:  The BS MAY maintain a CS type of MSs.

   R5:  The BS MAY support IP routing capabilities for the interface of
        ACR that use IP tunnel.

   The ACR requires following functions.

   R1:  The ACR SHOULD maintain a pair of MAC address of BSs and IP
        address of MSs.

   R2:  The ACR MAY maintain a pair of IP address of MSs and IP address,
        GRE key of BSs.

   When the CH communicates with MS, the packets are forwarded by PBR
   between ACR and CH via Internet.  The ACR sends IP packet to MS and
   receives from MS via BS either L2 forwarding or IP based tunnel.

4.2.  HBPD with L2 forwarding in IEEE 802.16 Networks

   Figure 3 shows a HBPD with L2 forwarding in the IEEE 802.16 network.

   The IEEE 802.16 CS type can not identify in the IEEE 802.16 frame.
   It is managed in the management plane based on information of network
   entry procedures.

   The payload type of IEEE 802.3 can identify by type value.  The type
   value is 0X0800 for IPv4 and 0X86DD for IPv6 [EtherType].

4.2.1.  Uplink HBPD from MS to ACR

   The MS sends IP packet to the BS with IEEE 802.16 frame.  It uses CID
   that acquires during the network entry procedures.

   The BS receives an IEEE 802.16 frame which payload is IP packet
   towards Internet from MS.  It searches forwarding database table to
   find a pair of MAC address and IP address of ACR and and extracts IP
   packet from IEEE 802.16 frame.  After finding the MAC and IP address
   of ACR, the BS sends IP packets to ACR by IEEE 802.3 frame which
   payload is IP packet extracted from IEEE 802.16 frame.  The type
   value of IEEE 802.3 frame SHOULD set based on CS type.

4.2.2.  Downlink HBPD from ACR to MS

   The ACR receives the packet of CH from Internet.  It checks
   destination IP address of MS to forward packet to the BS and searches
   layer 2 forwarding database table to find a pair of destination IP
   address of MS and MAC address of BS.  After finding the IP address of
   MS and MAC address of BS, the ACR sends IP packets to BS by IEEE
   802.3 frame based on layer 2 forwarding database table.  The
   destination MAC address of IEEE 802.3 frame from ACR to BS is a MAC
   address of appropriate BS.

   The BS receives an IEEE 802.3 frame which payload is IP packet
   towards MS from ACR.  It searches forwarding database table to find a
   pair of CID and IP address of MS and extracts IP packet from IEEE
   802.3 frame.  After finding the IP address and CID of MS, the BS
   sends IP packets to MS by IEEE 802.16 frame which payload is IP
   packet extracted from IEEE 802.3 frame.

   frame.  The type value of IEEE 802.3 frame SHOULD set based on CS
   type.

4.3.2.  Downlink HBPD from ACR to MS

   The ACR receives the packet of CH from Internet.  It checks
   destination IP address of MS to forward packet to the BS and searches
   GRE key to find a BS that maintains CID and IP address of MSs.  After
   finding the GRE key, the ACR encapsulates IP packets with GRE key and
   sends a packet to BS by GRE tunnel.

   The BS receives an GRE tunneled IP packet towards MS from ACR.  It
   searches forwarding database table to find a pair of CID and GRE key
   of appropriate MS and extract IP packet from GRE.  After that, the BS
   sends IP packets to MS by IEEE 802.16 frame with appropriate CID.

   protocol and other OSs can support direct IP packet over link frame.
   The Ethernet SHOULD support ARP for IP transmission.  Even if the use
   IP CS in IEEE 802.16, it SHOULD operate ARP to send IP packet.  The
   solution is dummy ARP at the driver for IP CS over IEEE 802.16.

5.2.  Dedicated IP device for IEEE 802.16

   A dedicated terminal for IEEE 802.16 is not required ARP functions
   for IP CS.

6.2.  Network entry procedures of IEEE 802.16

   Figure 6 shows an example of network entry procedures for IEEE
   802.16.

   The BS synchronize with MS in the IEEE 802.16 network.  The BS sends
   downlink map (DL-MAP) and uplink map (UL-MAP) messages every frame.
   The BS sends uplink channel descriptor (UCD) and downlink channel
   descriptor (DCD) messages periodically.

   The MS receives frames and finds out following information.  A DCD
   messages composes of information on transit time and receive time for
   duplex, center frequency, mobility function, BS identification,
   calculation method of radio signal, downlink burst profiles, and so
   on.  An UCD messages composes of information on uplink burst profile,
   contention-based reservation timeout, handover ranging, ranging
   codes, initial ranging intervals, power adjustment and report and so
   on.

   The MS sends a ranging (RNG) request messages with requested burst
   profile, MAC address of MS, MAC version from MS and receives RNG
   response (RNG-RSP) messages with ranging status, burst profile, MAC
   address of MS, basic CID and primary management CID from the BS.

   The MS sends a SS basic capability (SBC) request messages with
   subscriber transition gap, maximum transmit power, current
   transmitted power, OFDMA parameters such as FFT sizes, modulator,
   demodulator, CINR measurement capability, handover trigger metric and
   so on.  It receives a SBC response (SBC-RSP) messages with subscriber
   transition gap, security negotiation parameters such as PKM version,
   authorization policy, message authentication code, OFDMA parameters
   such as FFT sizes, modulator, demodulator, CINR measurement
   capability and so on from the BS.

   The MS sends privacy key management (PKM) request message with PKM
   identifier, payload that depends on authorization policy such as EAP
   or RSA in SBC-RSP.  It receives a PKM response (PKM-RSP) messages
   with PKM identifier and payload from the BS.  After that, the MS
   exchanges additional information such as key sequence number,
   lifetime, PKM configuration and so on.

   The MS sends registration (REG) request messages with information on
   number of uplink and downlink transport CIDs, supported mobility
   features, support of CS classification such as IPv4, IPv6, IPv6 over
   802.3, IPv6 over 802.3 and more, maximum number of classifiers, idle
   mode timeout, total number of provisioned service flow and so on.
   The MS receives a REG response (REG-RSP) messages with information on
   requested parameters and additional parameters such as system
   resource retain time, handover retransmission timer and so on.

   After the MS successfully registers to the BS, the BS sends a dynamic
   service addition (DSA) request messages with transaction identifier,
   uplink and downlink service flows.  A service flow information
   composes of service flow identification, CID for IP, service flow
   name, QoS parameters such as traffic priority, maximum sustained
   traffic rate, maximum traffic burst,tolerated jitter, maximum
   latency, CS specification, type of delivery, ARQ parameters, packet
   classification rule and so on.

   The MS responses to the BS by DSA response (DSA-RSP) messages with
   same transaction identifier of DSA-REQ and confirmation code.

   The BS replys DSA acknowledge (DSA-ACK) messages with same
   transaction identifier of DSA-RSP and confirmation code.

   The MS acquires IP address in accordance with IP CS.

   classification rules SHOULD identify with 145.101 for IPv6 packet of
   uplink and 146.101 for IPv6 packet of downlink in the DSA-REQ
   messages.

   The IPv6 packet classification rules SHOULD have a packet
   classification rule priority and index, IPv6 address and mask as
   shown in Figure 10.

   The encoding type '145.101.3.1' identifies priority of packet
   classification rule for IPv6 packet of uplink.  The default priority
   value is zero and higher value indicates higher priority.  The
   encoding type '145.101.3.5' identifies IPv6 destination address of
   packet classification rule for uplink.  This parameter specifies a

6.5.  Network entry for IPv4 and IPv6 dual CS

   The MS sends REG-REQ message that SHOULD set the bit #1 and the bit
   #2, value six, for type 7 for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet transmission.
   The BS responses REG-RSP messages that SHOULD set the value six to
   type 7.  The REG-REQ and REG-RSP MAY exchange one time to indicate
   dual stack support with value six.

   The DSA messages MAY exchange either one time or two times for dual
   stack.  When the DSA messages exchanges one time, DSA-REQ messages
   SHOULD set the value for IPv4 to two of type 28 which is CS
   specification.  The BS sends DSA-REQ messages that SHOULD set the
   value for IPv6 to two of type 28 which is CS specification.  It MAY
   send uplink and downlink parameters separately.

   It is unique per service flow.  The BS and MS SHOULD maintain at
   least two service flow for dual stack: One is for global IPv6 address
   and the other is IPv4 address.


7.  Security Considerations

   The address masks set to control IP packet at classification rule in
   DSx messages.  It is recommended that an address mask is all 1 to
   prevent IP spoofing on the IEEE 802.16 network.  This method allows
   that MS and BS transmit specified IP address.

   When an MS supports IPv6 CS or dual stack, [RFC4941] MAY use for
   privacy.  The DSC messages SHOULD be exchanged between MS and BS
