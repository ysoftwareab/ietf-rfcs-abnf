Abstract

   This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
   extension mapping for the management of Domain Name System (DNS)
   domain names subject to the Redemption Grace Period (RGP) policies
   defined by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
   (ICANN).  Specified in XML, this mapping extends the EPP domain name
   mapping to provide additional features required for RGP processing.

Internet-Draft              EPP RGP Mapping                     May 2003


1. Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP).  This mapping, an extension
   of the domain name mapping described in [2], is specified using the
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as described in [3] and XML
   Schema notation as described in [4] and [5].

   The EPP core protocol specification [6] provides a complete
   description of EPP command and response structures.  A thorough
   understanding of the base protocol specification is necessary to
   understand the mapping described in this document.

   Over the course of several months in 2002, the Internet Corporation
   for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) developed an implementation
   proposal [11] to provide a "grace period" for Domain Name System
   (DNS) domain name recovery (or redemption) before a domain name is
   purged from the repository of the authoritative registry for the
   domain name.  This mapping extends the EPP domain <renew> command to
   initiate the redemption process for a domain name that has entered
   the Redemption Grace Period (RGP) and it extends the EPP domain
   <info> response to identify the status of domains that have entered
   the RGP.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

2. Redemption Grace Period State Diagram

   The Redemption Grace Period (RGP) involves several domain state
   transitions as a domain name moves through the redemption process:

   1.   A domain is initially in the EPP "ok" status, or some other
        status that allows processing of the EPP <delete> command.

   2.   A <delete> command is received and processed for the domain
        name.

   3.   RGP begins once the <delete> command is processed successfully.
        The EPP status changes to "pendingDelete", and the RGP status is
        initialized to "redemptionPeriod".  The domain remains in this
        state until either a <restore> operation is requested or the
        redemption period elapses.

   4.   A <restore> operation can be requested using the extended EPP
        <renew> command.  Go to step 8 if the redemption period elapses
        before a <restore> request is received.

   5.   If the <restore> is successful, the Registry waits to receive a
        restore report from the registrar for a period of time defined
        by the Registry.  The EPP status remains "pendingDelete" (TBD:
        should it instead change back to "ok"?) and the RGP status
        changes to "pendingRestore". (TBD: should the report be
        submitted through the protocol (as part of the <restore>) or an
        out-of-band facility such as a web site?)

   6.   The domain name returns to the redemption period state (state 3)
        if a restore report is not received.

   7.   If a restore report is received the EPP status returns to "ok"
        (or whatever it was prior to processing the <delete> command),
        and the RGP status is removed completely.

   8.   The redemption period elapses before a <restore> request is
        received.

   9.   The EPP status remains "pendingDelete" and the RGP status
        changes to "pendingDelete".  The domain name remains in this
        state for a period of time defined by the Registry.

   10.  The domain name is purged once the pending delete period
        elapses.

   11.  The domain name is available for re-registration.

3. Object Attributes

   This extension adds additional elements to the domain name mapping
   described in the EPP domain mapping [2].  Only new element
   descriptions are described here.

3.1 Status Values

   This extension defines three new status values to represent the
   different states that a domain can be in as a result of redemption
   grace period processing.  These are:

      redemptionPeriod: This status value is used to describe a domain
      for which a <delete> command has been received, but the domain has
      not yet been purged because an opportunity exists to restore the
      domain and abort the deletion process. The amount of time that a
      domain can stay in this status before being entering purge
      processing is a matter of registry policy.

      pendingRestore: This status value is used to describe a domain
      that is in the process of being restored after being in the
      redemptionPeriod state.  The amount of time that a domain can stay
      in this status before being returned to the redemptionPeriod state
      is a matter of registry policy.

      pendingDelete: This status value is used to describe a domain that
      has entered the purge processing state after completing the
      redemptionPeriod state.  The amount of time that a domain can stay
      in this status before being being purged is a matter of registry
      policy.  A domain in this status MUST also be in the pendingDelete
      status described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4. EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [6]. The command mappings
   described here are specifically for use in implementing redemption
   grace period processes via EPP.

4.1 EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve object information: <check>
   to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to retrieve
   detailed information associated with an object, and <transfer> to
   retrieve object transfer status information.

4.1.1 EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <check> command
   or <check> response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4.1.2 EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [2].  Additional elements are
   defined for the <info> response.

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain child elements as described in [2].
   In addition, the EPP <extension> element MUST contain a child
   <rgp:infData> element that identifies the RGP namespace and the
   location of the RGP schema.  The <rgp:infData> element contains a
   single <rgp:rgpStatus> element that contains a single attribute "s"
   whose value describes the current RGP status of the domain.  Possible
   status values are described in section Section 3.1.

   Example <info> response for "redemptionPeriod" status:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0"

   S:    <resData>
   S:      <domain:infData

   [2].

4.2 EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.

4.2.1 EPP <create> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <create> command
   or <create> response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4.2.2 EPP <delete> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <delete> command
   or <delete> response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4.2.3 EPP <renew> Command

   This extension defines additional elements for the EPP <renew>
   command and response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

Internet-Draft              EPP RGP Mapping                     May 2003


   The EPP <renew> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to extend the registration period a domain object.  In
   addition to the EPP command elements described in the EPP domain
   mapping [2], the command MUST contain an <extension> element.  The
   <extension> element MUST contain a child <rgp:renew> element that
   identifies the RGP namespace and the location of the RGP schema.  The
   <rgp:renew> element contains a single <rgp:restore> element that
   contains no child elements of its own.

   Example <renew> command:

   When an extended <renew> command has been processed successfully, the
   EPP response is as described in the EPP domain mapping [2] except
   that an extension element is added to describe RGP status as a result
   of processing the <renew> command.  The extension element contains a
   single child element (<renData>) that itself contains a single child
   element (<rgpStatus>) that contains a single attribute "s" whose
   value MUST be "pendingRestore" if the <restore> request has been
   accepted.

   Example <renew> response:

5. Formal Syntax

   An EPP object mapping is specified in XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation of
   the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

6. Internationalization Considerations

   EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding
   information using the Unicode character set and its more compact
   representations including UTF-8 [9].  Conformant XML processors
   recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16 [10].  Though XML includes provisions
   to identify and use other character encodings through use of an
   "encoding" attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use of UTF-8 is
   RECOMMENDED in environments where parser encoding support
   incompatibility exists.

   As an extension of the EPP domain mapping [2], the elements, element
   content, attributes, and attribute values described in this document
   MUST inherit the internationalization conventions used to represent
   higher-layer domain and core protocol structures present in an XML
   instance that includes this extension.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [7].  Two URI
   assignments are requested.

   Registration request for the RGP namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:RGP-1.0

   Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
   document.

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the RGP XML schema:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:RGP-1.0

   Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
   document.

   XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

8. Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [6], the EPP domain
   name mapping [2], and protocol layers used by EPP.  The security
   considerations described in these other specifications apply to this
   specification as well.
