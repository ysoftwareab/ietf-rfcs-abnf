Abstract
   
   This document proposes the use of the new DNS RR type MCI 
   (Multicast Channel Identifier), as it is specifying SSM (Source 
   Specific Multicast) multicast channel [SSM] as a DNS Resource
   Record. It shall allow the advance multicast session advertisement
   by providing the dynamic mapping between SSM multicast channel 
   and MCI.

1. Introduction

   IP multicast is the efficient way of delivering IP packets from
   single source to multiple recipients or vice versa.  
   It is especially beneficial for the limited bandwidth network such
   as Wireless network.  However, one of the known challenge for 
   the deployment of widely commercialized IP multicast is the address
   management.  Unlike unicast IP address, Multicast IP addresses are 
   not assigned to each of individual hosts. It rather statically or 
   dynamically assigned to multicast group by service provider, and 
   it often has its own address semantics.  In order to expedite the 
   the deployment of commercialized IP multicast service, the method of
   locating dynamically changed multicast group information may be
   beneficial.

   The purpose of this document is to propose the use of MCI (Multicast
   Channel Identifier) as a DNS RR so as to identify dynamically changed
   multicast source and SSM destination IP address for the SSM channel.
   The SSM (Source-Specific Multicast) is defined in [SSM] as below.

   "A datagram sent with source IP address S and destination IP address
   G in the SSM range is delivered to each host socket that has 
   specifically requested delivery of datagrams sent by S to G, and
   only to those sockets."

   MCI shall provide the efficient way of identifying the SSM multicast
   group/channel information, that shall enable persistent mapping 
   between multicast channel and dynamically changed Source IP address 
   and SSM destination IP address.


2. Applicability Statement
   
   One of the challenge of the wide deployment of the multicast service
   is the address management.  SSM(Source Specific Multicast) is one of
   the proposed the solutions, the delivery semantics for host specific 
   addressing.
   
   IP address in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range are 
   currently designated as source specific multicast (SSM) destination 
   addresses and are reserved for use by source-specific applications 
   and protocols [IANA-ALLOCATION].

   The MCI RR defines the multicast channel.  The channel is identified
   by (S,G), G for SSM address and S for source host address [SSM].
   MCI (Multicast Channel Identifier) RR provides persistent way to
   identify the multicast channel information.

   There are two category of the multicast application that may 
   make use of MCI, One-to-Many and Many-to-Many cases.[QA]
   One-to-Many case is a single source sending to one or more receivers
   The example of One-to-Many is Scheduled AV presentation, IP Push 
   Service, File Distribution, White board, and etc.

   On the other hand, Many-to-Many case is multiple receivers also 
   represent multiple senders.  The example of Many-to-Many is multiple
   user network game, multi-user conference/chat and etc.

   In both cases, MCI can be beneficial because users can always locate
   the multicast group/channel by MCI, regardless of the dynamic 
   allocation multicast IP address and source IP allocation.  
   The multicast group subscribed user can access the service, since MCI
   shall always indicate unique SSM (S,G). Especially wireless mobile 
   case, MS(Mobile Station) are more likely dynamically assigned to new 
   Multicast IP address and source IP address.
   
   MS may be scattered over the visited networks, while having video 
   conference.  In that case, the potential members of the video 
   conference group subscribe the group to the host of the the group by
   registering the home IP address or NAI [AM] by outband signaling. 
   And then the host of the group can register MCI, assigned SSM 
   destination IP address, source IP addresses or NAI of the members 
   to DNS server.  On scheduled time, the members of the group query 
   the MCI to retrieve the SSM destination IP address, source IP 
   addresses or NAI of other group members, and then send IGMPv3 report
   message [IGMPv3] to attached multicast router to join the conference
   call.  With respect to session advertisement (Announcing information 
   about the group), there are several approaches available, including
   WWW and SAP (Session Announcement Protocol) [QA].  However, it is 
   outside the scope of this document.


3. MCI Resource Record
   
   MCI name space is resemble to Domain Name Space, except that it is a 
   sequence of one or more labels, made of the Multicast Channel 
   Identifier and domain name. MCI records cause no additional section 
   processing

   The MCI record has the DNS RR type of "?", hence has the same QTYPE 
   number.  Note: MCI RR requires IANA number assignment.
   
   The class of MCI RR is defined in the IN class only.

   TTL should be configured to minimize the time of the RR being cached

where:

SSM Destination Multicast IP address is the IP address in the 232/8 
(232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range.  It also follows AS number scheme
in RFC 1791 case 1 and RFC 3180(GLOP Addressing in 233/8)[ML], modified
as follows: the high octet has the value of 232, identifying SSM scheme.
There MUST be only one SSM Destination multicast IP address field.

IP Addr Count is one octet long and indicating the number of Source IP
addresses.

Source address is the four octet long Source Host IP address, 
it always precede to NAI field.

NAI Count is one octet long and indicating the number of NAI.

Network Access Identifier is the four octet long Name Access Identifier 
and it always comes after Source address field.

4. Examples

   Multicast Router that support GLOP addressing [ML] and SSM mechanism
   shall have the 16 bits AS(Autonomous System) number [ML] while 
   allowed to use the IP addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 
   232.255.255.255) range [SSM].  If the host attached to the 
   multicast router with AS number 5662 shall allow to use the subnet
   of 232.22.30.0 as a multicast IP address.  The AS number 5662 is 
   written in hexadecimal format as 161E. Separating out the two octets
   16 and 1E results in 22 and 30 in decimal format.  These values result
   in a subnet of 232.22.30.0 that would be uniquely reserved for the use
   of SSM capable AS 5662 domain.

   Resource Record for SSM MCI for starcraft.xbs.samsung.co.kr with two
   source IP address and one NAI will be like below:

   starcraft.xbs.samsung.co.kr  1440  IN   MCI   232.22.30.4
                                                 165.213.114.7
                                                 165.213.114.1

5. IPv6 support

   For IPv6, the address prefixes FF3x:: and FF2x:: are proposed for Source-
   Specific Multicast [SSMIPv6]. It shall be covered by another document



6. IANA Considerations

   It requires new RR type number from IANA.
