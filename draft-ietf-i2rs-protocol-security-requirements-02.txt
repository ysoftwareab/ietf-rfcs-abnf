1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) provides read and write
   access to information and state within the routing process.  The I2RS
   client interacts with one or more I2RS agents to collect information
   from network routing systems.

   This document describes the requirements for the I2RS protocol in the
   security-related areas of mutual authentication of the I2RS client
   and agent, the transport protocol carrying the I2RS protocol
   messages, and the atomicity of the transactions.  These requirements
   align with the description of the I2RS architecture found in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] document which solves the problem
   described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-problem-statement].

   [I-D.haas-i2rs-ephemeral-state-reqs] discusses I2RS roles-based write
   conflict resolution in the ephemeral data store using the I2RS Client
   Identity, I2RS Secondary Identity and priority.  The draft
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability] describes the traceability framework and
   its requirements for I2RS.  The draft
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements] describes the requirements for
   I2RS to be able to publish information or have a remote client
   subscribe to an information data stream.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Definitions

   This document utilizes the definitions found in the following drafts:
   [RFC4949], and [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]

   Specifically, this document utilizes the following definitions:

   access control

      [RFC4949] defines access control as the following:

         1)(I))protection of system resources against unauthorized use;

         2)(I)process by which use of system resources is regulated
         according to a security policy and is permitted only by
         authorized entities (users, programs, processes, or other
         systems) according to that policy;

         3)(I) (formal model) Limitations on interactions between
         subjects and objects in an information system;

         4)(O) "The prevention of unauthorized use of a resource,
         including the prevention of use of a resource in an
         unauthorized manner.";

         5.(O) /U.S.  Government/ A system using physical, electronic,
         or human controls to identify or admit personnel with properly
         authorized access to a SCIF.

   Authentication

      [RFC4949] describes authentication as the process of verifying
      (i.e., establishing the truth of) an attribute value claimed by or
      for a system entity or system resource.  Authentication has two
      steps: identify and verify.

   Data Confidentiality

      [RFC4949] describes data confidentiality as having two properties:
      a) data is not disclosed to system entities unless they have been
      authorized to know, and b) data is not disclosed to unauthorized
      individuals, entities or processes.  The key point is that
      confidentiality implies that the originator has the ability to
      authorize where the information goes.  Confidentiality is
      important for both read and write scope of the data.

   Data Integrity




Hares, et al.             Expires July 3, 2016                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements          December 2015


      [RFC4949] states data integrity includes

         1.  (I)The property that data has not been changed, destroyed,
         or

         2.  (O) "The property that information has not been modified or
         destroyed in an unauthorized manner."

   Data Privacy

      [RFC4949] describes data privacy as a synonym for data
      confidentiality.  This I2RS document will utilize data privacy as
      a synonym for data confidentiality.

   Mutual Authentication

      [RFC4949] implies that mutual authentication exists between two
      interacting system entities.  Mutual authentication in I2RS
      implies that both sides move from a state of mutual suspicion to
      mutually authenticated communication after each system has been
      identified and validated by its peer system.

   role

      [RFC4949] describes role as:

         1) (I) A job function or employment position to which people or
         other system entities may be assigned in a system.  (See: role-
         based access control.  Compare: duty, billet, principal, user.)

         2) (O) /Common Criteria/ A pre-defined set of rules
         establishing the allowed interactions between a user and the
         TOE.

      The I2RS uses the common criteria definition.

   role

      [RFC4949] describes role-based access control as: (I) A form of
      identity-based access control wherein the system entities that are
      identified and controlled are functional positions in an
      organization or process.

   Security audit trail

      [RFC4949] (page 254) describes a security audit trail as a
      chronological record of system activities that is sufficient to
      enable the reconstruction and examination of the sequence

      environments and activities surrounding or leading to an
      operation, procedure, or event in a security-relevant transaction
      from inception to final results.  Requirements to support a
      security audit is not covered in this document.  The draft
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability] describes traceability for I2RS
      interface and protocol.  Traceability is not equivalent to a
      security audit trail.

   I2RS the following phrase that incorporates an [RFC4949] definition:

   I2RS protocol data integrity

      The transfer of data via the I2RS protocol has the property of
      data integrity described in [RFC4949].

2.  Security-Related Requirements

   The security for the I2RS protocol requires mutually authenticated
   I2RS clients and I2RS agents.  The I2RS client and I2RS agent using
   the I2RS protocol MUST be able to exchange data over a secure
   transport, but some functions may operate on non-secure transport.
   The I2RS protocol MUST BE able to provide atomicity of a transaction,
   but it is not required to have multi-message atomicity and roll-back
   mechanism transactions.  Multiple messages transactions may be
   impacted by the interdependency of data.  This section discusses
   these details of these security requirements.

2.1.  Mutual authentication of I2RS client and I2RS Agent

   The I2RS architecture [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] sets the following
   requirements:

   o  SEC-REQ-01: All I2RS clients and I2RS agents MUST have at least
      one unique identifier that uniquely identifies each party.

   o  SEC-REQ-02: The I2RS protocol MUST utilize these identifiers for
      mutual identification of the I2RS client and I2RS agent.

   o  SEC-REQ-03:An I2RS agent, upon receiving an I2RS message from a
      I2RS client, MUST confirm that the I2RS client has a valid
      identifier.

   o  SEC-REQ-04: The I2RS client, upon receiving an I2RS message from
      an I2RS agent, MUST confirm the I2RS agent has a valid identifier
      .

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements          December 2015


   o  SEC-REQ-05: Identifier distribution and the loading of these
      identifiers into I2RS agent and I2RS Client SHOULD occur outside
      the I2RS protocol.

   o  SEC-REQ-06: The I2RS protocol SHOULD assume some mechanism (IETF
      or private) will distribute or load identifiers so that the I2RS
      client/agent has these identifiers prior to the I2RS protocol
      establishing a connection between I2RS client and I2RS agent.

   o  SEC-REQ-07: Each Identifier MUST be linked to one priority

   o  SEC-REQ-08: Each Identifier is associated with one secondary
      identifier during a particular read/write sequence, but the
      secondary identifier may vary during the time a connection between
      the I2RS client and I2RS agent is active.  The variance of the
      secondary identifier allows the I2RS client to be associated with
      multiple applications and pass along an identifier for these
      applications in the secondary identifier.

2.2.  Transport Requirements Based on Mutual Authentication

   SEC-REQ-09: The I2RS protocol MUST be able to transfer data over a
   secure transport and optionally MAY be able to transfer data over a
   non-secure transport.  A secure transport MUST provide data
   confidentiality, data integrity, and replay prevention.

   Note:The non-secure transport can be used for publishing telemetry
   data that was specifically indicated to non-confidential in the data
   model.  The configuration of ephemeral data in the I2RS Agent by the
   I2RS client SHOULD be done over a secure transport.  It is
   anticipated that the passing of most I2RS ephemeral state operational
   status SHOULD be done over a secure transport.  Data models SHOULD
   clearly annotate what data nodes can be passed over an insecure
   connection.  The default transport is a secure transport.

   SEC-REQ-10: A secure transport MUST be associated with a key
   management solution that can guarantee that only the entities having
   sufficient privileges can get the keys to encrypt/decrypt the
   sensitive data.  Per BCP107 [RFC4107] this key management system
   SHOULD be automatic, but MAY BE manual if the following constraints
   from BCP107:

      a)environment has limited bandwidth or high round-trip times,

      b)the information being protected has a low value and

      c)the total volume over the entire lifetime of the long-term
      session key will be very low,

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements          December 2015


      d)the scale of the deployment is limited.

   Most I2RS environments (I2RS Client - I2S Agents) will not have the
   environment described by BCP107 [RFC4107] but a few I2RS use cases
   required limited non-secure light-weight telemetry messages that have
   these requirements.  An I2RS data model must indicate which portions
   can be served by manual key management.

   SEC-REQ-11: The I2RS protocol MUST be able to support multiple secure
   transport sessions providing protocol and data communication between
   an I2RS Agent and an I2RS client.  However, a single I2RS Agent to
   I2RS client connection MAY elect to use a single secure transport
   session or a single non-secure transport session.

   SEC-REQ-12: The I2RS Client and I2RS Agent protocol SHOULD implement
   mechanisms that mitigate DoS attacks

2.3.  Data Confidentiality Requirements

   SEC-REQ-13: In a critical infrastructure, certain data within routing
   elements is sensitive and read/write operations on such data MUST be
   controlled in order to protect its confidentiality.  For example,
   most carriers do not want a router's configuration and data flow
   statistics known by hackers or their competitors.  While carriers may
   share peering information, most carriers do not share configuration
   and traffic statistics.  To achieve this, access control to sensitive
   data needs to be provided, and the confidentiality protection on such
   data during transportation needs to be enforced.

2.4.  Data Integrity Requirements

   SEC-REQ-14: An integrity protection mechanism for I2RS SHOULD be able
   to ensure the following: 1) the data being protected is not modified
   without detection during its transportation and 2) the data is
   actually from where it is expected to come from 3) the data is not
   repeated from some earlier interaction of the protocol.  That is,
   when both confidentiality and integrity of data is properly
   protected, it is possible to ensure that encrypted data is not
   modified or replayed without detection.

   SEC-REQ-15: The integrity that the message data is not repeated means
   that I2RS client to I2RS agent transport SHOULD protect against
   replay attack

   Requirements SEC-REQ-13 and SEC-REQ-14 are SHOULD requirements only
   because it is recognized that some I2RS Client to I2RS agent
   communication occurs over a non-secure channel.  The I2RS client to
   I2RS agent over a secure channel would implement these features.  In



Hares, et al.             Expires July 3, 2016                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements          December 2015


   order to provide some traceability or notification for the non-secure
   protocol, SEC-REQ-16 suggests traceability and notification are
   important to include for any non-secure protocol.

   SEC-REQ-16: The I2RS message traceability and notification
   requirements requirements found in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability] and
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements] SHOULD be supported in
   communication channel that is non-secure to trace or notify about
   potential security issues

2.5.  Role-Based Data Model Security

   The [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] defines a role or security role as
   specifying read, write, or notification access by a I2RS client to
   data within an agent's data model.

   SEC-REQ-17: The rules around what role is permitted to access and
   manipulate what information plus a secure transport (which protects
   the data in transit) SHOULD ensure that data of any level of
   sensitivity is reasonably protected from being observed by those
   without permission to view it, so that privacy requirements are met.

   SEC-REQ-18: Role security MUST work when multiple transport
   connections are being used between the I2RS client and I2RS agent as
   the I2RS architecture [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] states.  These
   transport message streams may start/stop without affecting the
   existence of the client/agent data exchange.  TCP supports a single
   stream of data.  SCTP [RFC4960] provides security for multiple
   streams plus end-to-end transport of data.

   SEC-REQ-19: I2RS clients MAY be used by multiple applications to
   configure routing via I2RS agents, receive status reports, turn on
   the I2RS audit stream, or turn on I2RS traceability.  Application
   software using I2RS client functions may host several multiple secure
   identities, but each connection will use only one identifier with one
   priority.  Therefore, the security of each I2RS Client to I2RS Agent
   connection is unique.

   Please note the security of the application to I2RS client connection
   is outside of the I2RS protocol or I2RS interface.
