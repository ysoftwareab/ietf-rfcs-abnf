Abstract 

   Bicasting or multicasting of traffic can be used to reduce the impact 
   of a handoff by allowing a Mobile Node to receive a stream via 
   multiple paths simultaneously. However, receiving of multiple copies 
   of the packets may have a negative impact on applications which

   cannot distinguish duplicate packets. This holds true for all 
   applications using TCP which mistakes the packet duplication from 
   bicasting with congestion and reduces the sending rate drastically. 
   This document specifies an IPv6 destination option header which can 
   be used to identify and discard duplicate copies of bicasted packets.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

1. Introduction 

   Bicasting as specified in [4] can be used to reduce the impact of the 
   handoff. A Mobile Node would receive the packets using two alternate 
   paths, via the old network and a new network. If Mobile Node can only 
   connect to one network at a time, it will receive a single continuous 
   stream of packets with minimal disruptions. When coupled with 
   protocols such as Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6, packet loss can be 
   avoided completely. However, if Mobile Node can connect both to the 
   new and old network simultaneously during the handoff, it will 
   receive duplicate copies of each packet. This would typically be the 
   case in vertical (inter-technology) handoffs and in some cases in 
   horizontal (intra-technology) handoffs.  

   The impact of duplicate packets is two fold: Firstly, they result in 
   a significant overhead. Secondly, they may have an impact on the 
   application performance, if duplicates are not recognized as such and 
   dropped. This document focuses on the use of the extension header to 
   distinguish and discard duplicates at the receiver. Therefore, the 
   draft addresses the impact on application performance, but does not 
   directly address the overhead of delivering duplicate packets. 
   However, the extension header could be used together with the Fast 
   Handovers for Mobile IPv6 framework [3] for dropping the duplicate 
   packets already at New Access Router to reduce over-the-air overhead 
   of bicasting. 

   The impact on application performance depends on the characteristics 
   of the transport protocol used and the application. This impact is 
   especially large on applications which use TCP as the transport 
   protocol. The problem with TCP is that it mistakes the deliberate 
   duplication of packets from bicasting with duplication from network 
   errors. The Eifel extension to TCP [5] may reduce the impact of the

   duplicates. However, there may be IPR issues with Eifel which prevent 
   its widespread use.   

   This document specifies a protocol for recognizing duplicates which 
   allows discarding of them at the network layer. The protocol uses an 
   IPv6 extension header for labeling the packets with a sequence 
   number. The sender marks each copy with the same sequence number and 
   the receiver keeps track of received sequence numbers and drops any 
   duplicate packets.

   Type 

     Value is xxxx (to be assigned by IANA). 

   Length  

     8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length of the Mobility  
     Header in octets, excluding the type and length fields. 

   Sequence number 

     32-bit sequence number identifies a packet within a flow. The 
   sender sets the field to zero for the first the packet which it 
   bicasts and increments the value for each packet. The receiver keeps 
   track of the received values.  

    

3. Operation of the sender in the protocol 

   The sender MUST set the sequence number to zero of the first packet 
   it bicasts. The sender SHOULD set the same sequence number to each 
   copy of the packet that it sends using different paths.

   The sender MUST increment the sequence number for each packet that it 
   sends.  

      

4. Operation of the receiver in the protocol 

   The receiver SHOULD keep track of received sequence numbers. Upon 
   receiving a packet, the receiver SHOULD extract the sequence number 
   from the packet and deliver the packet if it has not already received 
   a packet with the same sequence number within its receive window.  

   A reasonable size for the receive window would allow dropping of 
   duplicates received via asymmetric paths, for example via a GPRS link 
   and via a WLAN link. In this case, the window should cover the 
   different latencies of the links. Use of buffering together with 
   bicasting may result in a significantly longer delay for packets from 
   one path. The implementation of the receive window is outside the 
   scope of this specification.   

            

5. Security Considerations 

   The dropping of duplicate packets could be abused by an attacker to 
   drop selected packets from a stream. This threat can be avoided by 
   using IPsec with integrity protection for the bicasted stream[2].
