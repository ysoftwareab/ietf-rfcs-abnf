Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing user identities and the
   names, addresses, and credentials required manage access control, for
   use with various protocols.  This draft was motivated by the need for
   the configuration of authorized user identities for the iSCSI
   protocol, but has been extended to be useful for other protocols that

   have similar requirements.  It is important to note that this MIB
   module provides only the set of identities to be used within access
   lists; it is the responsibility of other MIB modules making use of
   this one to tie them to their own access lists or other authorization
   control methods.

1.  Introduction

   This MIB module will be used to configure and/or look at the
   configuration of user identities and their credential information.
   For the purposes of this MIB module, a "user" identity does not need
   to be an actual person; a user can also be a host, an application, a
   cluster of hosts, or any other identifiable entity that can be
   authorized to access a resource.

   Most objects in this MIB module have a MAX-ACCESS of read-create;
   this module is intended to allow configuration of user identities and
   their names, addresses, and credentials.  MIN-ACCESS for all objects
   is read-only for those implementations that configure through other

   means, but require the ability to monitor user identities.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The IPS-AUTH-MIB module does not directly address objects within
   other modules.  The identity address objects contain IPv4, IPv6, or
   other address types, and as such may be indirectly related to objects
   within the IPv4 [RFC2011] or IPv6 [RFC2465] MIB modules.

   This MIB module does not provide actual authorization or access
   control lists; it provides a means to identify entities that can be
   included in other authorization lists.  This should generally be done
   in MIB modules that reference identities in this one.  It also does
   not cover login or authentication failure statistics or
   notifications, as these are all fairly application-specific, and are
   not generic enough to include here.

   The user identity objects within this module are typically referenced
   from other modules by a RowPointer within that module.  A module
   containing resources for which it requires a list of authorized user
   identities may create such a list, with a single RowPointer within
   each list element pointing to a user identity within this module.
   This is neither required nor restricted by this MIB module.

Internet Draft            IPS Authorization MIB             October 2005


5.  Relationship to the USM MIB Module

   The User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] also defines the
   concept of a user, defining authentication and privacy protocols and
   their credentials.  The definition of USM includes the SNMP-USER-
   BASED-SM-MIB module which allows configuration of SNMPv3 user
   credentials to protect SNMPv3 messages.  Although USM's users are not
   related to the user identities managed by the IPS-AUTH-MIB module
   defined in this document, USM will often be implemented on the same
   system as the IPS-AUTH-MIB module, with the SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB
   module used to manage the security protecting SNMPv3 messages,
   including those which access the IPS-AUTH-MIB module.

   The term "user" in this document is distinct from an SNMPv3 user, and
   is intended to include, but is not limited to, users of IP storage
   devices.  A "user" in this document is a collection of user names
   (unique identifiers), user addresses, and credentials that can be
   used together to determine whether an entity should be allowed access
   to a resource.  Each user can have multiple names, addresses, and
   credentials.  As a result, this MIB module is particularly suited to
   managing users of storage resources, which are typically given access
   control lists consisting of potentially multiple identifiers,
   addresses, and credentials.  This MIB module provides for
   authorization lists only, and does not include setting of data
   privacy parameters.

   In contrast, an SNMPv3 user as defined in [RFC3414] has exactly one
   user-name, one authentication protocol, and one privacy protocol,
   along with their associated information and SNMP-specific
   information, such as an engine ID.  These objects are defined to
   support exactly the information needed for SNMPv3 security.

   For the remainder of this document, the term "user" means an IPS-
   AUTH-MIB user identity.


6.  Relationship to SNMP Contexts

   Each non-scalar object in the IPS-AUTH-MIB module is indexed first by
   an Instance.  Each instance is a collection of identities that can be
   used to authorize access to a resource.  The use of an instance works
   well with partitionable or hierarchical devices and fits in logically
   with other management schemes.  Instances do not replace SNMP
   contexts, however they do provide a very simple way to assign a
   collection of identities within a device to one or more SNMP
   contexts, without having to do so for each identity's row.

7.  Discussion

   This MIB module structure is intended to allow the configuration of a
   list of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses,
   credentials, and certificates which when combined will distinguish
   that identity.

   The IPS-AUTH-MIB module is structured around two primary "objects",
   the authorization instance, and the identity, which serve as
   containers for the remainder of the objects.  This section contains a
   brief description of the "object" hierarchy and a description of each
   object, followed by a discussion of the actual SNMP table structure
   within the objects.

7.1.  Authorization MIB Object Model

   The top-level object in this structure is the authorization instance,
   which "contains" all of the other objects.  The indexing hierarchy of
   this module looks like:

   ipsAuthInstance
      -- A distinct authorization entity within the managed system.
      -- Most implementations will have just one of these.
      ipsAuthIdentity
         -- A user identity, consisting of a set of identity names,
         -- addresses, and credentials reflected in the following
         -- objects:
         ipsAuthIdentityName
            -- A name for a user identity.  A name should be globally
            -- unique, and unchanging over time.  Some protocols may
            -- not require this one.
         ipsAuthIdentityAddress
            -- An address range, typically but not necessarily an
            -- IPv4, IPv6, or Fibre Channel address range, at which
            -- the identity is allowed to reside.
         ipsAuthCredential
            -- A single credential, such as a CHAP username,
            -- which can be used to verify the identity.
            ipsAuthCredChap
               -- CHAP-specific attributes for an ipsAuthCredential
            ipsAuthCredSrp
               -- SRP-specific attributes
            ipsAuthCredKerberos
               -- Kerberos-specific attributes

   Each identity contains the information necessary to identify a
   particular end-point that wishes to access a service, such as iSCSI.

Internet Draft            IPS Authorization MIB             October 2005


   An identity can contain multiple names, addresses, and credentials.
   Each of these names, addresses, and credentials exists in its own
   row.  If multiple rows of one of these three types are present, they
   are treated in an "OR" fashion; an entity to be authorized need only
   match one of the rows.  If rows of different types are present (e.g.
   a name and an address), these are treated in an "AND" fashion; an
   entity to be authorized must match at least one row from each
   category.  If there are no rows present of a category, this category
   is ignored.

   For example, if an ipsAuthIdentity contains two rows of
   ipsAuthIdentityAddress, one row of ipsAuthCredential, and no rows of
   ipsAuthIdentityName, an entity must match the Credential row and at
   least one of the two Address rows to match the identity.

   Index values such as ipsAuthInstIndex and ipsAuthIdentIndex are
   referenced in multiple tables, and rows can be added and deleted.  An
   implementation should therefore attempt to keep all index values
   persistent across reboots; index values for rows that have been
   deleted must not be reused before a reboot.

7.2.  ipsAuthInstance

   The ipsAuthInstanceAttributesTable is the primary table of the IPS-
   AUTH-MIB module.  Every other table entry in this module includes the
   index of an ipsAuthInstanceAttributesEntry as its primary index.  An
   authorization instance is basically a managed set of identities.

   Many implementations will include just one authorization instance row
   in this table.  However, there will be cases where multiple rows in
   this table may be used:

   - A large system may be "partitioned" into multiple, distinct virtual
     systems, perhaps sharing the SNMP agent but not their lists of
     identities.  Each virtual system would have its own authorization
     instance.

   - A set of stackable systems, each with their own set of identities,
     may be represented by a common SNMP agent.  Each individual system
     would have its own authorization instance.

   - Multiple protocols, each with their own set of identities, may
     exist within a single system and be represented by a single SNMP
     agent.  In this case, each protocol may have its own authorization
     instance.

   An entry in this table is often referenced by its name
   (ipsAuthInstDescr), which should be displayed to the user by the

Internet Draft            IPS Authorization MIB             October 2005


   management station.  When an implementation supports only one entry
   in this table, the description may be returned as a zero-length
   string.


7.3.  ipsAuthIdentity

   The ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable contains one entry for each
   configured user identity.  The identity contains only a description
   of what the identity is used for; its attributes are all contained in
   other tables, since they can each have multiple values.

   Other MIB modules containing lists of users authorized to access a
   particular resource should generally contain a RowPointer to the
   ipsAuthIdentAttributesEntry which will, if authenticated, be allowed
   access to the resource.

   All other table entries make use of the indices to this table as
   their primary indices.

7.4.  ipsAuthIdentityName

   The ipsAuthIdentNameAttributesTable contains a list of UTF-8 names,
   each of which belong to, and may be used to identify, a particular
   identity in the authIdentity table.

   Implementations making use of the IPS-AUTH-MIB module may identify
   their resources by names, addresses, or both.  A name is typically a
   unique (within the required scope), unchanging identifier for a
   resource. It will normally meet some or all of the requirements for a
   Uniform Resource Name [RFC1737], although a name in the context of
   this MIB module does not need to be a URN.  Identifiers that
   typically change over time should generally be placed into the
   ipsAuthIdentityAddress table; names that have no uniqueness
   properties should usually be placed into the description attribute
   for the identity.

   An example of an identity name is the iSCSI Name, defined in
   [RFC3720]. Any other MIB module defining names to be used as
   ipsAuthIdentityName objects should specify how its names are unique,
   and the domain within which they are unique.

   If this table contains no entries associated with a particular user
   identity, the implementation does not need to check any name
   parameters when verifying that identity.  If the table contains
   multiple entries associated with a particular user identity, the
   implementation should consider a match with any one of these entries
   to be valid.

Internet Draft            IPS Authorization MIB             October 2005


7.5.  ipsAuthIdentityAddress

   The ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable contains a list of addresses at
   which the identity may reside.  For example, an identity may be
   allowed access to a resource only from a certain IP address, or only
   if its address is in a certain range or set of ranges.

   Each entry contains a starting and ending address.  If a single
   address is desired in the list, both starting and ending addresses
   must be identical.

   Each entry contains an AddrType attribute.  This attribute contains
   an enumeration registered as an IANA Address Family type [IANA-AF].
   Although many implementations will use IPv4 or IPv6 address types for
   these entries, any IANA-registered type may be used, as long as it
   makes sense to the application.

   Matching any address within any range within the list associated with
   a particular identity is considered to be a valid match.  If no
   entries are present in this list for a given identity, its address is
   automatically assumed to match the identity.

   Netmasks are not supported, since an address range can express the
   same thing with more flexibility.  An application specifying
   addresses using network masks may do so, and convert to and from
   address ranges when reading or writing this MIB module.

7.6.  ipsAuthCredential

   The ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable contains a list of credentials,
   each of which may be used to verify a particular identity.

   Each credential contains an authentication method to be used, such as
   CHAP [RFC1994], SRP [RFC2945], or Kerberos [RFC1510].  This attribute
   contains an object identifier instead of an enumerated type, allowing
   other MIB modules to add their own authentication methods, without
   modifying this MIB module.

   For each entry in this table, there will exist an entry in another
   table containing its attributes.  The table in which to place the
   entry depends on the AuthMethod attribute:

   CHAP     If the AuthMethod is set to the CHAP OID, an entry using the
            same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredChap table, which contains the CHAP username.

   SRP      If the AuthMethod is set to the SRP OID, an entry using the
            same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the



Bakke, Muchow              Expires April 2006                   [Page 8]

Internet Draft            IPS Authorization MIB             October 2005


            ipsAuthCredSrp table, which contains the SRP username.

   Kerberos If the AuthMethod is set to the Kerberos OID, an entry using
            the same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredKerberos table, which contains the Kerberos
            principal.

   Other    If the AuthMethod is set to any OID not defined in this
            module, an entry using the same indices as the
            ipsAuthCredential entry should be placed in the other module
            that define whatever attributes are needed for that type of
            credential.

7.7.  IP, Fibre Channel, and Other Addresses

   The IP addresses in this MIB module are represented by two
   attributes, one of type AddressFamilyNumbers, and the other of type
   AuthAddress.  Each address can take on any of the types within the
   list of address family numbers; the most likely being IPv4, IPv6, or
   one of the Fibre Channel address types.

   The type AuthAddress is an octet string.  If the address family is
   IPv4 or IPv6, the format is taken from the InetAddress specified in
   [RFC4001].  If the address family is one of the Fibre Channel types,
   the format is identical to the FcNameIdOrZero type defined in
   [RFC4044].

7.8.  Descriptors: Using OIDs in Place of Enumerated Types

   Some attributes, particularly the authentication method attribute,
   would normally require an enumerated type.  However, implementations
   will likely need to add new authentication method types of their own,
   without extending this MIB module.  To make this work, this module
   defines a set of object identities within ipsAuthDescriptors.  Each
   of these object identities is basically an enumerated type.

   Attributes that make use of these object identities have a value
   which is an OID instead of an enumerated type.  These OIDs can either
   indicate the object identities defined in this module, or object
   identities defined elsewhere, such as in an enterprise MIB module.
   Those implementations that add their own authentication methods
   should also define a corresponding object identity for each of these
   methods within their own enterprise MIB module, and return its OID
   whenever one of these attributes is using that method.

7.9.  Notifications

   Monitoring of authentication failures and other notification events
   are outside the scope of this MIB module, as they are generally
   application-specific.  No notifications are provided or required.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      All tables provide the ability to set up which credentials may be
      used to access services on the managed system, to remove
      legitimate credentials (a denial of service), or to remove
      individual credentials to weaken the requirements for access of a
      particular service.  Write access must always be tightly
      controlled.  Note that some types of credentials, such as CHAP or
      SRP, also require passwords or verifiers to be associated with the
      credential.  These are managed outside this MIB module.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      All tables provide the ability to find out which names, addresses,
      and credentials would be required to access services on the
      managed system.  If these credentials are easily spoofed
      (particularly the name or address), read access to this MIB module
      must be tightly controlled.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   In many implementations, the objects in this MIB module can be read
   and modified via other mechanisms or protocols in addition to this
   MIB module.  For the system to be secure, other mechanisms that can
   read and modify the contents of this MIB module must also address the
   above issues, and handle the threats outlined in [RFC3411], section
   1.4.
