  1. Abstract

     The Robust Header Compression Working Group has embarked upon the
     development and standardization of header compression schemes that
     perform well over links with high error rates and long round-trip
     times. The goal is that the schemes must perform well for cellular
     links built using technologies such as WCDMA, EDGE, and cdma2000.
     Of particular importance to the 3GPP2 community is the spectral
     efficiency of IP/UDP/RTP header compression for the voice over IP
     application to mobiles. Currently, the ROHC protocol adds at least
     one byte of overhead to each frame, when compared with ordinary
     circuit voice.  This draft proposes a new zero-byte profile for
     ROHC to enable the use of physical channel timing as a substitute
     for sequence numbers.  This allows for vocoded frames to be sent
     without any headers whatsoever, dramatically reducing the
     bandwidth required for voice over IP flows.

  3. Introduction

     End-to-end IP-based multimedia applications, enabled by call
     control protocols such as  SIP [3], will allow the rapid
     development of new kinds of communication services.  In wireless
     applications, the need will then arise to support the transport of
     RTP packets to and from a mobile endpoint.  Voice sessions
     transmit short frames of data, usually on a continuous basis
     according to known activity factors.  The frequency and length of
     the voice packets requires compression of RTP packet overhead in
     order to reduce the bandwidth used by the call, because the
     uncompressed headers will often be longer than the codec data
     itself.  If efficiency comparable to the existing circuit voice
     service cannot be obtained, carriers will be hard pressed to
     justify deployment of end-to-end IP based multimedia.

     The Robust Header Compression Working Group has standardized a
     header compression scheme that performs well over links with high
     error rates and long round-trip times. The current standardized
     ROHC algorithms are able to reduce the IP/UDP/RTP overhead to one
     or two bytes on average as well as tolerate some loss of packets
     and still maintain local decompression state without complete
     retransmission of a new IP/UDP/RTP header. In addition to the one
     or two bytes of header overhead some amount of bandwidth is
     necessary for feedback between decompressor and compressor or to
     retransmit a partial or complete header when the local state
     cannot be repaired.

     Of particular importance to the 3GPP2 community is the spectral
     efficiency of IP/UDP/RTP header compression for voice-over-IP
     application to mobiles. 3GPP2 carriers have indicated that voice
     over IP must have spectral efficiency comparable to legacy circuit
     transport over-the-air in order for them to deploy voice-over-IP
     to mobiles. To achieve such spectral efficiency, IP/UDP/RTP header
     compression must not transport any additional bytes over-the-air.

     An earlier version of this draft proposed the use of the real-time
     physical channel timing to convey a sequence number to the
     decompressor. Other types of information such as static fields
     like IP addresses are sent over a sister data link that is assumed
     to exist between compressor and decompressor, in addition to the
     over-the-air connection that carries codec data. Because header
     information was sent once and never updated, this method did not
     exactly reproduce all bits of the IP/UDP/RTP header; however, the
     behavior of the reproduced header could have been "good enough"
     for many voice-over-IP applications over cellular links. Such

     header compression was categorized as non-transparent header
     compression.

     Feedback from ROHC membership indicated that bit-identical
     transparency should be maintained as much as possible.  This draft
     proposes a new ROHC profile for zero-byte compression that allows
     for context updates.  Each update carries information relating it
     to the real-time stream of vocoder frames, enabling it to be
     properly placed with respect to the data stream.  This allows for
     any field changes resulting from updates in the IP, UDP, or RTP
     header to be properly communicated to the decompressor and applied
     at the right point in the stream.  Also, any slippage of sequence
     numbers with respect to the physical channel timing due to clock
     drift or channel reset events can be communicated and fixed.

     A basic premise of this draft is that the codec data carried on
     the real-time physical link should be sent in a format that is
     largely unchanged from the existing circuit voice interface.  This
     will allow for the flexible development of new codecs that can
     make use of every bit of available payload without restrictions of
     any kind. The authors believe that embedding of ROHC overhead
     within the codec stream will be cumbersome for some phones and
     data nodes. In any case, it is not possible to embed all messages
     (both initial and dynamic updates) in the codec stream without
     introducing segmentation and reassembly mechanisms, because some
     updates will be longer than the longest air frame supported by the
     physical link.

     This draft proposes a new ROHC profile that maintains transparency
     but does not embed ROHC messages in the codec stream.  Instead we
     continue to rely on a sister data link to carry full header
     updates but now add synchronous information to these updates.  As
     with the original GEHCO proposal, the scheme is applicable to
     certain cellular links that synchronously transport vocoded or
     other multimedia payloads so that the compressor may be certain
     that the compressed frame will be delivered with a fixed and
     predictable delay.  One example of such a cellular link is the
     cdma2000 air interface with cdma2000 vocoders.

     In the next section, this draft discusses assumptions of the
     underlying link layer that makes zero byte compression schemes
     possible. The draft then proposes a protocol in the form of a ROHC
     profile for transparent zero byte RTP header compression, making
     extensive use of existing ROHC messages. However, instead of
     inserting such ROHC overhead in the codec stream, this profile
     uses the sister data link, adding only a couple of new extensions
     to current ROHC message fields.  Of course, there is some overhead
     when packet fields must be updated, but we expect such updates to
     be rare.

  4. cdma2000 Link Characteristics and Implications

     The cdma2000 link synchronously transports physical frames every
     20ms. The number of bytes in a physical frame varies based on
     signaling negotiation between the user and the radio network as
     well as other criteria, such as backlog (for the forward direction
     of the network to mobile). The physical frames are sent in over-
     the-air connections. Currently, six such connections may exist
     simultaneously. The connections feature two modes, one in which
     the physical frames are subject to retransmission, and another in
     which they are not. In cdma2000, the over-the-air connections are
     referred to as service instances. The mode with retransmission
     serves to improve the error rate and thereby improve the
     throughput of TCP. It has variable delay. The one without
     retransmission behaves synchronously and each 20ms frame has a
     fixed number of bits such that the physical frame will be
     delivered in 20ms. There are four types of physical frames: full
     rate (171 bits), half rate (80 bits), quarter rate (40 bits) and
     eighth rate (16 bits). One reason for these different "rate"
     frames is variable rate vocoding. Depending on speech activity and
     patterns, the vocoder puts out a number of bytes that exactly fits
     one of these four physical frame sizes.

     The over-the-air connections have priority. Voice payloads are
     sent in over-the-air connections with high priority in the mode
     without any retransmission. It is possible to say with certainty
     for these kinds of frames that if a physical frame is transmitted
     it will be delivered 20ms later, if it is received at all. We
     consider the frame to be dropped if it has uncorrectable errors.
     Because the delivery of these frames is a very precise timing
     hierarchy, the underlying physical timing of the channel may be
     used to convey sequence number information to the decompressor,
     thus avoiding the overhead of actually sending sequence numbers.

     In addition to the foregoing use of underlying physical timing, 3G
     cellular data links offer another feature that may be exploited to
     great advantage in a transparent zero byte header compression
     scheme: Link start time. Link start time is the absolute real time
     that the network tells the mobile to transmit the first on an
     over-the-air connection. In cdma2000, link start time is referred
     to as "action time". Link start time is thus a synchronization
     event between the network and mobile node. To achieve
     transparency, the network first conveys link start time to the
     compressor-decompressor pairs (for both directions). The
     compressor then sends a full header in the form of an IR over the
     sister data link to the decompressor. This IR contains an
     extension that associates some a time offset from the action time
     with the particular full header (i.e. an RTP sequence number and
     RTP timestamp plus other packet fields).  Recall that time offsets
     are simply measured by over-the-air framing times. In 3G wireless

                                 GEHCO                      March, 2001


     data, a frame time as explained above is 20ms. Thus the time
     offset is a whole number representing the number of 20ms periods
     from the action time. The compressor may indicate an offset of
     packets into the future at which the particular full header will
     be correct or may indicate a current time. The decompressor will
     be able to adjust the current timestamp context to the correct
     timestamp and sequence number based on this information.

     The compression context may change for various reasons, e.g. a
     handoff in which no packets are sent because the physical layer is
     being re-established and therefore does not exist to carry timing
     information. In this case the compressor (once notified of the
     handoff) may send a full header in the form of an IR-DYN to update
     and re-synchronize the decompressor with new timing and sequence
     number information.  IR-DYN carrying full or partial headers could
     be optionally sent to refresh the state of the decompressor.  We
     also supply a small Update packet for updating only sequence
     number, timestamp, and IP-ID fields.  Any packet may carry
     extensions for updating CSRCs, as in basic ROHC-RTP.

     The use of a reasonably reliable sister data link with
     acknowledged messaging, in conjunction with the physical timing
     characteristics of the 3G data link, provide for a basis of a
     transparent zero byte overhead RTP compression profile.


  5. Profile Selection

     Given that there are two kinds of header compression, usual ROHC
     and zero byte header compression it becomes necessary for the
     mobile node and network to know when to use a usual ROHC header
     compression for RTP or the zero byte version.  The foregoing
     indicates that the zero byte approach only applies for those links
     which are tuned to the codec, i.e., for which the framing matches
     the codec size as well as provides timing information.

     Our approach is to first assume that that the mobile node has an
     application client (e.g. SIP) that knows the type media involved.
     If the application realizes that the codec and link type apply for
     a zero byte profile, the application arranges (via suitable API)
     for the establishment of a suitable bearer and the transmission of
     a full header in the form of an IR packet to be sent to the
     network. As in GEHCO, the full header carries a reference to the
     link used for transport of codec information.

     The network side compressor and decompressor, however, do not
     contain an application client and therefore do not know the codec
     type. The solution proposed below is for the mobile node to send a
     partial header in an IR packet that contains the IP addresses, UDP
     ports, and protocol (RTP) type.  This IR also contains the

     reference to the over-the-air connection (likely same one as in
     the other direction) used to carry the codec data. When the
     network receives an RTP packet that matches this filter, the
     network compressor sends an IR packet with sequence number
     matching the action time to the mobile node decompressor.

  6. Zero Byte Header Compression Profile

     This section proposes a new profile for ROHC specifically designed
     to support zero-byte header compression.  As with any profile, a
     new profile code must be assigned by IANA.


  6.1 State Machine

     We propose the state machine for the zero byte profile in Figure 1.

                           Figure 1: State Machine

     In Figure 1, the decompressor begins in the IR state and
     transitions directly to the SO state upon receipt of a properly
     formed IR packet. The compressor will resend the IR packet until
     it receives an acknowledgment. This is important to ensure that
     the decompressor has a context state with link start time (an
     offset to the packet time of a given sequence number). The
     compressor may send zero byte header packets (codec samples) on
     the over-the-air connection at the same time. The decompressor
     will discard these zero byte header packets until it receives the
     IR packet. That is, the decompressor never decompresses while in
     the IR state.



  Hiller, McCann             Expires 09/2001                           7
                                 GEHCO                      March, 2001


     The decompressor remains in the SO state until some irregularity
     occurs in the packet stream that requires an unpredictable change
     in the context state of the decompressor. Examples of
     irregularities are handoffs during which time there is no physical
     layer present as well as changes in static headers such as CSRC
     fields due to users adding or dropping from conference mixers.
     When such irregularities occur, the compressor sends an IR-DYN
     with a partial header to the decompressor. At the same time the
     compressor continues to send zero byte header packets, i.e. codec
     samples embedded in units of data the size of native airframes.
     The decompressor transitions to the FO state upon receipt of the
     IR-DYN and updates the context. The decompressor continues to send
     decompress the zero byte packets during this time. Upon context
     update of the IR-DYN data, the decompressor transitions back to
     the SO state decompressing packets according to the updated
     context. The decompressor acknowledges the IR-DYN as usual on the
     sister data link. A similar behavior applies for an IR-DYN
     refresh, if the particular implementation supports optional
     refreshes.

     There is no reason for the decompressor to transition to the IR
     state once it reaches the SO state.


  6.2 Mode

     This zero byte profile operates over a bi-directional link. We
     specify acknowledged operation for messaging so this is R-mode
     with respect to the ROHC draft.


  6.3 Packet Types

     We require the following packet types for our new profile:

           * IR packet
           * IR-DYN packet
           * Feedback packet
           * Update packet

     The sister data link in this scheme provides framing so that
     segmentation services of ROHC are not necessary.

     Section 5.7.7 of the ROHC draft states the basic structure of the
     IR and IR-DYN packets.  Our profile extends these formats as shown
     in Figures 2 and 3.

     CRC: 8-bit CRC computed according to section 5.9.1 of of the ROHC
     draft

     Channel ID: A reference to the over-the-air connection that
     carries the zero byte header packets.

     Offset: This is the offset in airframe times from the link start
     time to which the IR packet's information applies

     Dynamic chain: A chain of the static subheader information. For
     this profile, the relevant header information will be the RTP
     dynamic part of section 5.7.7.6 of the ROHC draft.


     As discussed above, profile selection between usual ROHC RTP and
     zero byte overhead ROHC RTP requires a reverse flow spec that the
     informs the network compressor of RTP packets to be compressed
     using the zero byte ROHC RTP profile. When the IR packet for this
     profile has the I bit set to 1, the IR packet contains a flow spec
     with IP addresses and UDP ports. The Rev-Flow-Spec may be viewed
     as a message sent from the mobile node side decompressor to the
     network side compressor of which packets to compress using the
     zero byte RTP profile and on which link channel the codec payloads
     should be sent. This reverse flow spec packet is necessary to
     preserve the independence of the location of call servers, etc.,
     in wireless architectures.  Reception of this packet does not
     cause a state transition of the compressor in Figure 1. Rather it
     simply readies the network to commence zero byte ROHC RTP header
     compression if an RTP packet matching flow should arrive. The Rev-
     Flow-Spec does not contain any RTP initialization. The actual
     initialization of the decompressor will occur when the compressor
     in the network receives an associated RTP packet and sends an IR
     packet to the receiver as specified above. Successful reception of
     that IR packet then causes the compressor to move to the SO state.
     Note that the CID spaces in each direction are distinct. The CID
     used for the reverse flow spec is not related to the CID that will
     actually be used for data in the opposite direction (i.e. that
     appears in a later IR packet from the network to the mobile after
     traffic finally appears).

     In comparison to the ROHC IR and IR-DYN there is no payload field
     because the payloads are transferred in the over-the-air
     connection that carries codec data. The IR and IR-DYN on the other
     hand are carried on the sister reliable data link.

     This profile requires acknowledged transport of IR and IR-DYN
     control messages. Acknowledgments are carried in ROHC feedback
     packets for this profile as shown in Figure 4.

     Note that if the CID is not 0 or if large CIDs are in use from
     compressor to decompressor, then there is one or two extra bytes
     of CID preceding this feedback data.  This means that the Code
     field from the feedback format is set to 4, 5, or 6 depending on
     the length (0, 1, or 2, respectively) of CID.

     This profile uses the following header information from the ROHC
     draft.

     * Initialization of IPv6 header from ROHC Section 5.7.7.3
     * Initialization of IPv4 header from ROHC Section 5.7.7.4
     * Initialization of UDP header from ROHC Section 5.7.7.5
     * Initialization of RTP header from ROHC Section 5.7.7.6, TS=0,
       and the header formats from ROHC Section 5.8.6 for CSRC lists.


     This profile can not support AH or non-null ESP because the over-
     the-air connection does not have any header bits to carry
     necessary encrypted fields.


     Initialization of GRE Headers occurs by the addition of an
     Extension type 3 of Section 5.8.5.1 with the uncompressed GRE list

     item of section 5.8.8.4. GRE CRCs, if used, should be regenerated
     from the received packets since there are not bits to transport
     them with the codec data. GRE sequence numbers are assumed to
     increment synchronously with the physical layer, as with RTP
     sequence numbers. The GRE sequence number in an IR is applicable
     at the offset time in the IR or IR-DYN.

     All of the above initialization headers appear in an IR or IR-DYN
     packet in Figures 2 and 3.

     It may be necessary to update certain fields, such as when the
     physical layer slips forward or backwards, or when contributing
     sources join or leave a conference mixer. Figure 5 shows an update
     packet for this profile that may be used to update certain fields.
     As with other control packets for this profile, the update packet
     must be acknowledged with a feedback packet. Note that an
     Extension 3 of section 5.7.5 of the ROHC draft may be added to
     update GRE parameters or the CSRC list.

  7. Security Considerations

     Making use of end-to-end IP Security negates the effectiveness of
     header compression.  Such packets must be carried over a data link
     with higher-layer framing because the physical layer frames
     discussed here will be too small to carry the essential security
     headers.  Mechanisms for RTP payload encryption have been
     suggested; this draft allows for transparent reconstruction of
     timestamps and sequence numbers that can be used as cryptographic
     synchronization sources.  Note that if silence suppression is used
     (something not supported by existing cellular vocoders) then the
     sequence numbers may become slightly out-of-sync (assuming we do

     not wish to send a context update at the start of every talk
     spurt) but the timestamps should still be accurate.

     If the radio link features strong encryption this may satisfy
     users that only care about security on the wireless link itself;
     such encryption is optional and users who defer it are more
     susceptible to attack.  The identity of users of these radio links
     will be authenticated via a private key in both the radio realm
     and the IETF based AAA realm. In general, it is very difficult in
     inject frames onto the radio links; as other drafts on compression
     have pointed out, if a hacker is able to inject frames onto the
     radio links, the problems this creates far exceed just those
     associated with compression and decompression.
