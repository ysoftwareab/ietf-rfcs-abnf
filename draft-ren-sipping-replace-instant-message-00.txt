Internet-Draft           Replace Instant Message               July 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3261 [2] is extended by RFC 3428 [3] to carry instant messages in
   MESSAGE requests.  One of the aspects of MESSAGE requests according
   to RFC 3428 [3] is the lack of support for replacing or recalling a
   previous page-mode instant message.  For example, Alice wants to send
   an instant message to Bob, But Alice finds she has sent it to a wrong
   person.  In this case Alice wants to recall that instant message.

   The requirement can be expressed as:

      REQ-1: It MUST be possible for a user to replace or recall a
      previous instant message with a new instant message.

   The similar requirement has been realized in many messaging services
   (e.g., Email, SMS and MMS).  We try to reuse some mechanisms to meet
   the requirement with a page-mode instant message.

   In this early stage we intend to discuss the open issues first.
   After the open issues are discussed this document will provide a
   solution to fulfill the above requirements.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]

3.  Overview

   There are some open issues need to be considered before introducing
   the instant message replace or recall mechanism:

      OPEN ISSUE 1: There may be two ways to archive this requirement,
      extension to CPIM (Common Presence and Instant Messaging) or
      extension to SIP MESSAGE.  They are overlap, but have different
      benefit.  Which one should we choose?  Or both?

      OPEN ISSUE 2: If we need extension to SIP MESSAGE, could we reuse
      the Replaces header field defined in RFC 3891?

      OPEN ISSUE 3: How to identify a previous page-mode instant
      message?  Message-ID can be used to match an email, what is for
      MESSAGE?
