Abstract

   Today, a SIP user wanting to charge for a service needs to establish
   an agreement with all prospective callers.  This administrative
   overhead can be avoided if caller and callee can prove the duration
   and existence of a call in case of a dispute.  The draft describes
   requirements for protocols and SIP extensions that can be used to
   implement such functionality.

1. Requirements language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [1].

2. Introduction

   The total cost of a call can be split into the following components:

   access

      flat fees for IP access, SIP proxy/registrar usage etc.

   bandwidth reservation

      Scaling issues have prevented the introduction of bandwidth
      reservation protocols in today's Internet.  Such protocols will
      have their own accounting mechanisms.

   bandwidth usage

      With the deployment of DiffServ, usage sensitive billing will
      become more widespread.  Accounting of DiffServ packets is done in
      routers and is outside the scope of SIP.  However, a SIP proxy
      controlling a COPS [3] Policy Decision Point could prevent a
      customer from being flooded with expensive high priority packets.

   service provided by the callee

      Examples are PSTN-Gateways and support hotlines.  Today, these
      services require an agreement between caller and callee before the
      first call is made.  The costs and administrative efforts to
      handle the agreements limit the applicability of such schemes.
      There is no way to prove the existence or duration of a call.

   An ad-hoc way to charge incoming calls would allow to introduce new
   services and to replicate the PSTN's Premium Rate service.  Providers
   of gateways, media and conferencing servers would profit from lower
   administrative costs.

   Ordinary end  users could charge callers: instead of blocking spammer
   domains, solicitors could be charged with special fees for making
   calls ("pay for attention").  End users could charge callers and use
   the money to pay their own high-priority VoIP traffic.

   The rest of this document deals with the requirements for charging
   services provided by an endpoint.

3. Overall Requirements

3.1 Scalability and Reliability

   If third parties or intermediaries are needed to meet the
   requirements of this draft, the amount of state in those entities
   must be kept as low as possible.  It MUST be possible to distribute
   the load on multiple entities without mirroring state.

   It SHOULD be possible for a client to recover within a few seconds
   when a third party or intermediary fails.

3.2 Cheap End Devices

   Some end devices have only limited CPU power and RAM space.  A
   solution SHOULD either use this resources sparingly enough or SHOULD
   allow to delegate functionality to an intermediary.  In the latter
   case the UA MUST use a secure transport protocol to contact the
   intermediary.

   Permanent storage in the UA MUST NOT be a prerequisite.  A solution
   MUST be able to cope with device failures and network outages.

3.3 Mobile End Devices

   Wireless links often have limited capacity, high error rates and use
   small MTU sizes.  Solutions SHOULD prefer protocols with short
   messages and few round trips.

3.4 Reuse of existing protocols and formats

   Existing cryptographic protocols and formats SHOULD be re-used
   wherever possible.

   To implement non-cryptographic functionalities, existing protocols
   and formats SHOULD be used, as long as no other requirements are
   violated.

4. Functional Requirements

4.1 Fairness

   The caller MUST NOT be able to repudiate the time and duration of a
   call.

   The callee MUST NOT be able to charge for calls that never happened.

4.2 Anonymity

   It MUST be possible for the caller to remain anonymous.  Only in
   cases of dispute, a trusted third party should be able to reveal the
   real identity of the caller.

4.3 Expense Control

   The caller needs to know about the price of the service offered by
   the callee.  It must either be possible to

   o  allow the involvement of a trusted third party, which either
      provides the pricing information itself or records/signs the
      pricing information provided by the callee.

   o  or allow the caller to set an explicit expense limit.

   The latter could be achieved by using signed tokens as in some
   micropayment protocols.

   If the session setup fails, the caller MUST NOT be charged.

   Furthermore, it must be possible to

   o  immediately display the current rate to the caller

   o  allow user-defined pricing schemes that depend on day time and
      contents of a SIP message (like From: header, To: header etc).

   o  allow the calling UA to process the pricing information
      automatically

   Today's SIP can fulfill only some of these requirements:

   o  The callee refers to his web page (eg.  in a Call-Info header) or
      plays an announcement.  However, in cases of dispute it will not
      be easy to prove the correctness of the web page or announcement.

   o  The callee uses a Call-Info header that includes a URL pointing to



Beck                     Expires June 20, 2003                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    SIP endpoint service charging requirements  December 2002


      a trusted third party's web page.  This web page displays the
      pricing information of the callee's service.  This solution
      requires a web browsing capability in the UA.

   o  The callee is reachable through a trusted third party that plays
      the announcement and refers to the callee's real UA (eg.  by using
      the REFER method).  This solution introduces additional setup
      delays.

   Neither web pages nor voice announcements can be processed
   automatically.

4.4 Accounting

   The callee's UA can easily record accounting data, like call duration
   and generated IP traffic.  The question is whether the caller can
   trust the callee.

4.4.1 Evidence of session establishment

   The callee needs an evidence that a session has been established.  In
   case of dispute, he can show the evidence and prove that a caller has
   really called.  The evidence should contain the relevant details of
   the session (time, media etc).

4.4.2 Evidence of session teardown

   In case of dispute, the caller needs an evidence that a session ended
   at a certain time.  As sessions can be terminated without any message
   exchange (eg.  if a UA dies), the evidence generation is hard.

   The evidence of session teardown can be replaced with the evidence of
   an ongoing session.  The session timer mechanism described in [4]
   uses this technique.

   In case of dispute, the evidence of session establishment and the
   evidence of session teardown show that there has been a session.  To
   determine the accurate duration of the session the evidences need to
   be time-stamped by a trusted third party.

   Periodical evidences during a session have some advantages.  The call
   duration can be derived from the number of evidences and no secure
   time source is needed.  The evidence of session teardown needs no
   extra mechanism.  However, there is a trade-off between the
   resolution of the call duration measurement and signaling bandwidth
   requirements.  A cooperative callee will only charge for the exact
   call duration, though.

5. Security Considerations

   Some of the above requirement sections deal with security issues
   which are discussed there.  Proven security mechanisms and protocols
   should be used wherever possible.

   Forging evidences MUST NOT be possible in reasonable time without
   specialized hardware or very large clusters.

   It MUST be possible to exchange security relevant parts of a solution
   with improved versions.  If an implementations speaks to an older
   version it MUST either ask for user confirmation or reject the
   message.  The user MUST be warned of bidding-down attacks.

   To avoid denial of service attacks, every stateful entity MUST
   authenticate clients before creating state.

Appendix A. TLS-based micropayment schemes

   Some web payment schemes use TLS (Transport Layer Security [5])
   connections to a trusted third party.  These schemes could be adopted
   for SIP:

   1.  The callee returns a https URI in a Call-Info header of a '402
       Payment Required' response.  The https URI points to a web page
       of a trusted billing service provider.  The URI contains the
       callee's name, a service description, rates and a unique ID.

   2.  The billing service provider checks if the caller is able to pay.

   3.  The caller's UA starts a browser to display the billing service
       provider's web page which displays the callee's pricing
       information.  The caller confirms his willingness to pay by
       clicking on a button.

   4.  The billing service provider redirects the caller's web browser
       to a SIP URI that contains cryptographically signed transaction
       data.  The caller's SIP UA calls this SIP URI and the callee
       checks the cryptographic portion of it.  If it is valid, the
       callee accepts the call.

   This procedure requires some interaction between UA and web browser.
   A web browser is not always present, though.  Periodical small
   payments to limit the caller's risk are inconvenient.  The billing
   service provider's web page can't be processed by a program that
   assists the user.

Appendix B. Evaluation of the Open Settlement Protocol

   The Open Settlement Protocol [6] is a promising protocol candidate.
   A trusted third party, the OSP server, hands out signed authorization
   tokens.  The authorization tokens are a kind of ticket.  Like a
   ticket, the token contains a lifespan information (valid-after,
   valid-until).

   OSP does not really record an evidence of session establishment.  It
   records the fact that some user is willing to pay for a call.  OSP is
   not involved in the call signalling itself.  It can't provide an
   evidence of session teardown and is not able to verify the usage
   indications it receives.

   OSP allows periodic re-authorization that fits well into SIP's
   session timer mechanism.  The OSP server can estimate the call
   duration by counting the re-authorizations.  The settlement provider
   can use this estimation for billing if there is a significant
   difference between the caller's and the callee's usage indication.

B.1 Example Message Flow

   1.  The caller requests a token from an OSP server
       (AuthorizationRequest, AuthorizationResponse).

   2.  The caller sends an INVITE to the callee containing the OSP token
       [7].

   3.  The callee verifies the OSP token.  If it is invalid or missing,
       the caller responds with "402 Payment required".  If the token is
       valid, the callee accepts the call and responds with "200 OK".

   4.  If the callee does not trust the caller, he finishes the call
       when the caller's credit is used up.

   5.  To prevent the callee from dropping the call, the caller requests
       re-authorization from its OSP server and sends an INVITE or
       UPDATE message containing the new OSP token to the callee.

   	+-- UPDATE (token) -------------------------->|
   	|                       |                     |

   	|                       |                     |
   	+- ReAuthorizationReq ->|                     |
   	|                       |                     |
   	|<- ReAuthorizationRes -+                     |
   	|                       |                     |
   	+-- UPDATE (token) -------------------------->|

   	|                       |                     |
   	.. etc


   6.  After the call has finished, the callee sends a usage indication
       message to its OSP server.  The usage indication does not only

       contain information about the session duration, but also the OSP
       tokens received during the call.

       Alice's UA             OSP Server             Bob's UA
   	|                       |                     |
   	+-- BYE ------------------------------------->|

   	|<- UsageConfirmation --+- UsageConfirmation >|


   7.  The settlement provider who runs the OSP server derives a call
       detail record from the usage indications and the number of
       re-authorizations.


B.2 Discussion

   Some open questions remain:

   o  Is the OSP architecture scalable enough to handle requests of
      millions of SIP UAs? OSP was designed to operate with gateways,
      not with endpoints.  Periodic OSP re-authorizations and SIP
      session refreshs will stress OSP servers and SIP proxies.

   o  Is OSP too complex for small end devices? OSP uses HTTP, XML, S/
      MIME and TLS.  Many SIP devices already support HTTP for
      configuration purposes.  S/MIME and TLS can be used for SIP as
      well.  The memory and CPU requirements will be an obstacle for
      small and/or cheap end devices.

   o  Will OSP extend setup delays? OSP uses simple request/response
      pairs in a TLS connection.  If the UA and the OSP server keep
      existing TLS sessions open, the setup delay caused by TCP and TLS
      connection setup can be reduced.

   An expired draft (sinnreich-interdomain-sip-qos-osp-03) described an
   architecture where OSP was used to authenticate interdomain bandwidth
   reservations.  This approach would not necessarily collide with the
   OSP usage outlined here.  An INVITE would just carry two OSP
   authorization tokens, one for authorizing the bandwidth reservation
   and one for authorizing access to a non-free service.
