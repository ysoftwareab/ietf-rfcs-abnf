  Abstract 
   
  In this draft, we present the features of IPv6 protocol related to 
  NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) and requirements for IPv6 
  signaling as NTLP in different Internet transport infrastructure, 
  such as SDH/SONET switch, Optical cross-connect (OXC), ATM switch, 
  Ethernet switch, wireless system, and router. In this framework, user 
  data is transported via nodes in the data plane and signaling 
  messages are routed to NEs in the control plane. We propose the new 
  protocol, Internet Signaling Message Protocol (ISMP) for carrying 
  signaling messages. And other delivering methods of signaling 
  messages in IPv6 network are also presented in appendix.

Requirements for IPv6 Signaling as NTLP                      July 2003 
 
 
1. Introduction 
   
  There is the transition of the Internet from IPv4 to IPv6. IPv6 is 
  designed to run well on high performance networks (e.g., Gigabit 
  Ethernet, OXC, ATM, etc.) and at the same time still be efficient for 
  low bandwidth networks (e.g., wireless network). In addition, it 
  provides a platform for new Internet functionality that will be 
  required in the near future. 
   
  The architecture described in this draft clearly separates the 
  control plane and the data plane. In addition, control plane is made 
  of two signaling protocol layers: NSIS Transport Layer Protocol 
  (NTLP) and NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) in [NSISFW]. User 
  data is transported via nodes in the data plane and signaling 
  messages are routed to NEs in the control plane. This path-decoupled 
  signaling take advantage of reusing existing transport devices whose 
  data plan cannot recognize the IP header and having flexibility in NE 
  deployment. 
 
  Actually, IPv6 has many native features to support QoS and other 
  capabilities for the emerged network, such as Hop-by-Hop Option 
  header, Routing Option header, and Destination Option header as 
  described in [RFC1883]. We will describe about that in section 2.2.  
 
  By utilizing this IPv6 features, we can assist the existing signaling 
  protocols without modifying themselves and it can provide additional 
  features to NTLP. On the other hand, one who doesn't care of the 
  modification of the existing signaling protocols may modify slightly 
  the existing signaling mechanisms to adopt IPv6 signaling as NTLP. We 
  present requirements for IPv6 signaling as NTLP in section 3. 
 
  Also we will propose the methods those modify existing signaling 
  protocol specifications to make use of the power of IPv6 function to 
  the signaling mechanisms in section 4. And other delivering methods 
  of signaling messages in IPv6 network are also presented in appendix.  
 
1.1. Existing QoS Signaling Protocols and NSIS Activities 
 
  A number of different QoS mechanisms have been developed by the IETF.  
  Usually the QoS mechanisms are supported in the IP layer or the 
  Transport layer (e.g., TCP or UDP). We can regard following QoS 
  signaling protocols. 
   
  o  RSVP-TE(including RSVP-TE extension for GMPLS [RFC3473]) 
   
  RSVP-TE [RFC3209] specifies the extension to RSVP for establishing 
  traffic engineered path. Both RSVP [RFC2210] and RSVP-TE are 
  implemented on the IP layer. RSVP is defined to support QoS in IP 
  network with fine granularity, but this leads the scalability 
  problems. RSVP-TE has some additional concepts, like label 
  distribution, aggregated flow, and explicit route.

  o  CR-LDP(including CR-LDP extension for GMPLS [RFC3472]) 
   
  CR-LDP [RFC3212], from LDP, use the TCP(and UDP) layer instead of IP 
  layer in RSVP-TE. So this signaling protocol uses the features of TCP 
  protocol. 
   
  The NSIS Working Group focuses on providing end-to-end signaling 
  across different network environment and develops the requirements, 
  architecture and protocols for the next IETF steps on signaling. They 
  defines requirements for signaling in [NSISREQ], analyzes existing 
  protocols for signaling the QoS requirements of flows to nodes in an 
  IP network in [NSISANALYSIS], and provides a model for the network 
  entities that take part in signaling in [NSISFW].  
 
1.2. Motivation of IPv6 Signaling as NTLP 
   
  Carriers are currently migrating to a consolidated single network 
  based on IP technology called the Next-Generation Network (NGN) and 
  so future transport networks is expected to be made of different 
  transport elements such as SDH/SONET switch, Ethernet switch, ATM 
  switch, OXC, wireless system, router, etc. NGN clearly separate 
  control functions from transport functions, both service control 
  functions and network resource control functions. 
   
  And the current Internet is transiting from IPv4 to IPv6. We cannot 
  predict the deployment step of IPv6 in real environment. But we can 
  assume that the mobile access network is the major application of 
  IPv6. This is mainly due to the large address space of IPv6. Also we 
  can predict that the large percentile of packets in that network will 
  be carried real time traffic such as voice or video. It is worth to 
  lay emphasis on these applications will heavily depend on the QoS 
  mechanism in IPv6 networks. But, existing signaling protocols concern 
  only on delivery signaling message over IPv4 network as we see 
  section 1.1.  
   
  In signaling point of view, IPv6 protocol has many features related 
  to QoS and other capabilities. By utilizing IPv6 features, such as 
  ease of defining explicit route, flow labeling capability and 
  improved support for extensions and options like Hop-by-Hop Option 
  header or Destination Option header, we can improve the efficiency of 
  IPv6 networks and we can enjoy that without modifying the existing 
  signaling protocols.

  separates the control plane and the data plane. In addition, control 
  plane is made of two signaling protocol layers: NSIS Transport Layer 
  Protocol (NTLP) and NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) in [NSISFW].  
 
  Data flow messages are transported from sender to receiver via node 
  N1, N2 and N3 in the data plane and signaling messages are routed to 
  NEs in the control plane. Node in data plane can be a different 
  transport device such as SDH/SONET switch, Optical cross-connect 
  (OXC), ATM switch, Ethernet switch, wireless system, router, etc.  
   
  This path-decoupled signaling take advantage of reusing existing 
  transport devices whose data plan cannot recognize the IP header and 
  having flexibility in NE deployment.

2.2. The Features of IPv6 Protocol related to NTLP 
   
  To validate the further discussion, we must describe the native 
  features of IPv6 protocol related to NTLP.  
 
  o  Priority Flow Control 
   
  Each node has many flows with different priority of various data 
  rates and QoS requirements. These flows are classified and scheduled 
 
 
Choi, et. al.                                               [Page  5] 

Requirements for IPv6 Signaling as NTLP                      July 2003 
 
 
  with the capability of making intelligent decisions on how resource 
  allocation SHOULD be controlled. The Priority filed in IPv6 header 
  [RFC1883] enables a source to identify the desired delivery priority 
  of its packets, relative to other packets form the same source. 
   
  o  Explicit Route 
   
  In IPv6 specification [RFC1883], there is a route extension header to 
  use explicit route. Explicit route is important for traffic 
  engineering in IPv6 networks. There is already ROUTE object in RSVP-
  TE specification [RFC3209]. In the case of CR-LDP [RFC3212], some 
  TLVs are defined to be used for this purpose. We discuss the explicit 
  route setup for interworking with MPLS signaling in IPv6 network. 
  (See section 4.2) 
 
  o  Flow Identification. 
   
  In IPv6 flow label specification [FLOWLABEL], flow identification 
  includes the 3-tuple of the Flow Label and the Source and Destination 
  Address fields. Flow state is created and stored by the NEs and 
  packet classification is done by the node on data plane. 
 
 
3. Requirements for IPv6 Signaling as NTLP 
   
  This section defines requirements for IPv6 signaling as NTLP. 
   
3.1. Resource Reservation  
   
  The key role of signaling protocol is to allocate and reserve the 
  network resource for the purpose of meeting end-to-end QoS 
  requirements along the entire path. The IPv6 signaling protocol MUST 
  be able to deal with such resource allocation request. 
   
3.2. Flow Label Distribution 
   
  To make use of flow label field of IPv6 basic header and identify the 
  flow label between the nodes on specific data path, label-binding 
  information SHOULD be delivered between the related nodes. The 
  related nodes are on the specific path of the flow. Label value is 
  only meaningful between a pair of nodes. And the label value is 
  predetermined before forwarding data packet along the path. 
 
3.3. Backward Compatibility  
  
  The existing signaling protocols such as RSVP, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP and so 
  on are implemented in IPv4 network. These signaling protocols MUST be 
  operated in IPv6 network. Therefore, they MUST support backward 
  compatibility for operating both IPv6 and IPv4. 
   
3.4. Easy to implement 
 
 
Choi, et. al.                                               [Page  6] 

Requirements for IPv6 Signaling as NTLP                      July 2003 
 
 
   
  There are two aspects related with this issue. First, we can consider   
  the compatibility of the new signaling with existing signaling. So   
  the implementation can be done with minimum modification of previous   
  architecture and components. Second we can omit some functions of   
  previous signaling so that we just make a light-weight signaling    
  mechanism. We are still studying about this carefully because it    
  makes some effects with other various factors such like the    
  capabilities of this new signaling and the signaling translation    
  between two heterogeneous AS's. We can think above two factors 
  simultaneously and SHOULD make some trade-off. 
 
3.5. Scalability 
   
  The performance of the signaling protocol SHOULD not largely depend 
  on the scale of the network to which IPv6 is applied (e.g. the number 
  of nodes, the number of physical links etc). The signaling function 
  SHOULD keep constant performance as much as possible regardless of 
  network size. Aggregating flows can reduce resource allocation and 
  runtime management overhead. 
 
3.6. Mobility Support 
 
  To provide the QoS in mobile environment, we SHOLD consider the   
  mobility of nodes and dynamic behavior of related flows. In signaling,   
  we are concerning two problems. First the flow management can be   
  considered with per aggregated flow or per flow. In some point, 
  snapshot of network can be described with many aggregated flows and 
  related QoS management. But as time goes, some flow of mobile node 
  departs one aggregated flow and join the other aggregated flow. 
  Second the support of micro mobility issues. To make use of old flow 
  related resources as much as possible, we should define Nearest 
  Common Router (NCR) and provide the finding mechanism. This work is 
  under working. We just consider the need of modification or 
  adaptation of that mechanism in our work. 
 
3.7. Signaling Interworking 
   
  Most of the signaling protocols are based on the underlying network 
  infrastructure, i.e. IP networks, but they don't depend on the minor 
  version of the network. For example, one signaling protocol designed 
  for the IPv4 network can be used in IPv6 network without modifying 
  the specification of the signaling mechanism. Rather than to do like 
  that, the signaling protocol adopt itself to the different version of 
  network implementation by defining option fields like IP version 
  information field and related information like IPv4 addresses (32 
  bits) or IPv6 addresses (128 bits). Therefore, Signaling in IPv6 
  network MUST consider the interworking with IPv4 network and existing 
  wireline/wireless telco network. 
 
3.7.1. Signaling Interworking between IPv6 and IPv4

Requirements for IPv6 Signaling as NTLP                      July 2003 
 
 
    
  To be gradually deployed, we can consider the situation of mixed 
  nodes that some implement the IPv6 signaling and others implement the 
  IPv4 signaling. Deployment point of view, we consider three stages of 
  evolution scenarios. 
      
  - first stage (stage 1): IPv4 ocean and IPv6 island  
  - second stage (stage 2): IPv6 ocean and IPv4 island  
  - third stage (stage 3): IPv6 ocean and IPv6 island  
      
  In first stage shown in Figure 2, MPLS-based core network (e.g., IPv4 
  ocean) and IPv6 access network (e.g., IPv6 island) is deployed. In 
  this environment, core signaling such as RSVP-TE and CR-LDP is used 
  in IPv4 ocean and access signaling such as RSVP and RSVP-TE is used 
  in IPv6 island. To support end-to-end QoS signaling, these protocols 
  SHOUD perform the mapping of IPv6 with IPv4. Flow label information 
  of IPv6 header is translated to FEC(Forwarding Equivalent Class) 
  [RFC3031] information of MPLS. For this reason, signaling 
  interworking function is needed. Using this QoS signaling, flow 
  information is transmitted unchanged from source to destination and 
  the required resource is reserved and end to end path is established.

                 Figure 2. Signaling mapping (stage 1)  
    
   
  In second stage shown in Figure 3, IPv6 network will dominate over 
  IP4 network. This network is composed of IPv6-based core network 
  (e.g., IPv6 ocean) and IPv4-based access network (e.g., IPv4 island). 
  The existing IPv4 network is operated in MPLS. In this environment, 
  core signaling such as RSVP-TE and CR-LDP is used in IPv6 ocean and 
  access signaling such as RSVP and RSVP-TE is used in IPv4 island. FEC 
  information of IPv4 is translated to flow label information of IPv6.

3.7.2. Signaling Interworking between IPv6 and Existing Telco Network  
    
  We SHOULD consider the signaling interworking between IPv6 and 
  existing Telco network. Telco network may be composed of PSTN, 
  cellular, IMT2000 network and so on. Using signaling, the  
  physical/logical circuit is established. To support end-to-end QoS 
  signaling, we consider two cases (see Figure 5-6). Both cases SHOUD 
  perform the mapping of flow label and phsyiscal/logical circuit.

3.7.3. Support of Domain Service Model on Optical Transport Network  
    
  IPv6 network SHOULD support the signaling interworking with optical 
  transport network. The optical transport network control plane reuse 
  IP-based protocols that are based on the signaling and routing 
  mechanisms developed for IP traffic engineering applications. Core 
  signaling such as Optical-UNI (User-Network-Interface) [UNI] and 
  GMPLS signaling (RSVP-TE extensions [RFC3473], CR-LDP extensions 
  [RFC3472]) are used in domain service model on optical transport 
  network (see Figure 6). To support end-to-end QoS signaling, these 
  protocols SHOULD perform the interworking with access signaling of 
  IPv6 client network. Flow label information of IPv6 is translated to 
  optical label information.

4. IPv6 Next Header for Signaling 
   
  To delivery signaling messages in IPv6 networks, we propose method 
  using the new Next Header value for signaling message and define this 
  new protocol as Internet Signaling Message Protocol (ISMP).  
  Message body includes signaling messages like RSVP, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP. 
  Every signaling message is preceded by an IPv6 header or by more IPv6 
  extension headers. The signaling message is identified by a Next 
  Header value in the immediately preceding header.  
 
  The signaling messages have the following general format: 
   
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |Version| Traffic Class |           Flow Label                  | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |         Payload Length        |  Next Header  |   Hop Limit   |

  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                         Source Address                        + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               |

  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                      Destination Address                      + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               |

  |                      ISMP Message Body                        |

                           IPv6 header. Uses the same values as the 
                           IPv4 Protocol field [RFC1700] 
       
      Hop Limit            8-bit unsigned integer.  Decremented by 1 by 
                           each node that forwards the packet. The 
                           packet is discarded if Hop Limit is 
                           decremented to zero. 
       
      Source Address       128-bit address of the originator of the 
                           packet. 
       
      Destination Address  128-bit address of the intended recipient of 
                           the packet (possibly not the ultimate 
                           recipient, if a Routing header is present).   
   
   
  For this method, we MUST assign the new Next Header value of IPv6 
  header. Currently, RSVP is already assigned the value 46 decimal in 
  [RFC1700].  
   
  For example, if the Next Header value of IPv6 header is 46 decimal 
  the following ISMP message is RSVP message. The Next Header value of 
  other unassigned signaling messages SHOULD be assigned by IANA.  
 
  This method is very simple because of no additional extension header. 
  Therefore, the complexity of processing is reduced but this new 
  function MUST be implemented within IPv6 header.  
   
     Note: the signaling protocols, like SIP (Session Initiation 
     Protocol) [RFC3372], that are used for end-to-end path may use the 
     option TLVs to indicate the presence of the signaling information. 
     We already know that the real-time service cannot be served 
     without support of intermediate node. If some end-to-end sessions 
     are need to be guaranteed to their perceived QoS, the intermediate 
     nodes those are on the path may use the information to do 
     something related with QoS implicitly. 
 
 
5. IANA Considerations 
   
  The value field described in Section 3 SHOULD be registered and 
  maintained by IANA. The New values SHOULD be to be assigned via IETF 
  Consensus as defined in [RFC 2434]. 
   
   
6. Security Considerations 
   
  This document does not have any security concerns. The security 
  requirements using this document are described in the referenced 
  documents.

Appendix. The delivering Methods for Signaling Messages in IPv6 Network 
   
  In this section, we will describe methods of assisting existing 
  signaling protocols in IPv6 networks via using IPv6 extension headers.  
 
1. RSVP/RSVP-TE for IPv6 (including RSVP-TE extensions for GMPLS)  
      
  IPv6 Router alert option [RFC2711] within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option 
  header has the semantic "routers should examine the datagram more 
  closely". Using this option, IPv6 datagram containing signaling 
  messages are indicated and taken actions. 
   
  The router alert option has the following format: 
   
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |0 0 0|0 0 1 0 1|0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|        Value (2 octets)       | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                     length = 2 
   
  The first three bits of the first byte are zero and the value 5 in 
  the remaining five bits is the Hop-by-Hop Option Type number. 
  [RFC2460] specifies the meaning of the first three bits.  By   
  zeroing all three, this specification requires that nodes not   
  recognizing this option type should skip over this option and 
  continues processing the header and that the option must not change 
  en route. 
   
  There MUST only be one option of this type, regardless of value, 
  per Hop-by-Hop header. 
   
      Value:  A 2 octets code in network byte order with the following 
      values 
   
        0        Datagram contains a Multicast Listener Discovery 
                 message [RFC2710]. 
        1        Datagram contains RSVP message. 
        2        Datagram contains an Active Networks message. 
        3-65535  Reserved to IANA for future use. 
   
  Alignment requirement: 2n+0 
   
  Values are registered and maintained by the IANA.   
   
  We suggest the new value (= 3) for RSVP-TE messages. The value 3 is 
  REQUIRED the approval of IETF and SHOULD be assigned by IANA. Other 
  signaling messages MAY be added. In this case, the value for new 
  signaling message SHOULD be assigned by IANA. 
   
  The described method has some advantages and disadvantages. It is not 
  necessary to implement the new protocol for signaling. The existing

Requirements for IPv6 Signaling as NTLP                      July 2003 
 
 
  signaling message is used without change. However, all IPv6 datagram 
  containing a signaling message MUST contain this option within the 
  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option Header of such datagram. The additional option 
  header is redundant. 
      
      
2. CR-LDP for IPv6 (including CR-LDP extensions for GMPLS)  
   
  In the case of RSVP-TE, if the header of a packet is indicating "This 
  packet carries the signaling information." then the NEs can make 
  different treatment on just only look at the IP header.  
      
  On the other hand, like CR-LDP, the protocol running on the TCP(UDP) 
  layer may also make use of the benefit that IP header already notify 
  the existence of signaling information in the payload of IP packet. 
  Originally in the CR-LDP protocol, the signaling information is 
  transferred along the path per hop. If a NE sees the notification of 
  signaling information in the IP header, it can forward the signaling 
  packet and processing the signaling information simultaneously. So 
  the forwarding direction of packet can be done faster than old 
  mechanisms.
