Internet-Draft    Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension        March 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new skippable extension that can be added
   by Foreign Agent and Home Agent in Registration Reply message.  This
   extension can be added to Registration Reply message, independent of
   whether the registration has succeeded or failed.

   Content of the text string in this extension and it's usage by Mobile
   Node is implementation specific.  The text string in this extension
   is intended for the user of the Mobile Node.  For example, this
   message can be displayed on the Mobile Node's user interface, logged
   or handled in any other implementation dependent way, depending on
   the form of the Mobile Node.

   Typical contents of the text string will indicate registration
   failure reason, or a welcome message on successful registration.
   This is important as the failure reason code gives very limited
   information for interpretation by the user of the Mobile Node.  A
   string like "registration failed : Prepaid Quota for the user is
   exhausted", "registration success : Unauthorized Access is
   Prohibited", can  give a human readable description of the result of
   Mobile IP registration.

3.  Mobile IPv4 Message String Extension

   The Message String Extension confirms to the Short Extension format
   specified for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344].  The Message String Extension is
   a skippable extension.


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     Type      |   Length      |    Sub-Type   |    Text ....
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type:

      To be assigned by IANA.  An 8-bit identifier of the type mobility
      option.

   Length:

      8-bit unsigned integer, equaling 1 plus the length in octets of
      the Text field

   Sub-Type:

      1: if the extension is added by Home Agent

      2: if the extension is added by Foreign Agent

   Text:

      The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are
      implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable,
      and MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is recommended
      that the message contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC2279] characters.

4.  Operation and use of the Message String Extension

   The Message String Extension is only valid for use within Mobile IPv4
   Registration Reply messages.  The Message String Extension is a
   skippable extension.  Either Home Agent or Foreign Agent or both can
   add Message String Extension to Registration Reply messages.  Usage
   of Text field of the Message String Extension is implementation
   dependent.  For example, this message can be displayed on the Mobile
   Node's user interface, logged or handled in an implementation
   dependent way, depending on the form of the Mobile Node.

   Home Agent or Foreign Agent or both, MAY add the extension to each
   Registration Reply message to a Mobile Node.  However, as Mobile Node
   can retransmit the Registration Request, Mobile Node may throttle how
   often the user is notified of the message (either via display on user
   interface, logging etc.)  For example, Home Agent may reject the
   first Registration Request due to timestamp mismatch and may attach a
   Message String Extension for the same.  The client can adjust it's
   timestamp and send second Registration Request.  Home Agent may
   accept the Registration Request and add a different Message String
   Extension to the corresponding Registration Reply message.

5.  Security Considerations

   Message String Extension can be added by Home Agent or Foreign Agent
   or both.  If the extension is added by the Home Agent (extension with
   subtype 1) , it MUST appear before Mobile-Home Authentication
   Extension [RFC3344].  If the the Mobile Node cannot understand this
   extension, it should be skipped.

   If the extension is added by the Foreign Agent (extension with
   subtype 2), it MUST appear after the Mobile-Home Authentication
   Extension [RFC3344] and it MAY appear before the Mobile-Foreign
   Authentication Extension.  If Mobile Node cannot understand this
   extension, it should be skipped.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification reserves one number for the Message String
   Extension Section 3 from the space of numbers for skippable mobility
   extensions (i.e., 128-255) defined for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobileip-numbers.

   The value 145 is recommended for this extension.

   This specification also creates a new subtype space for the type
   number of this extension.  The subtype values 1 and 2 are defined in
   this specification.  The subtype value 1 is reserved for use by Home
   Agent and subtype value 2 is reserved for use by Foreign Agent.
   Other values can be allocated from this number space by IANA actions.
