Abstract

   This memo describes a MIB module that provides a conceptual layer
   between high-level "network-wide" policy definitions that affect
   configuration of the Differentiated Services (diffserv) subsystem and
   the instance-specific information that would include such details as
   the parameters for all the queues associated with each interface in a
   system.  This essentially provides an interface for configuring
   differentiated services at a conceptually higher layer than that of
   the Differentiated Services MIB.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a MIB module that can be used to convey management
   information about desired network-wide Differentiated Services based
   policy behavior. This module is designed to integrate with the
   Policy-based Management MIB module [PMMIBDR] as well as the
   Differentiated Services MIB module [RFC3289].  Together, these three
   documents represent an instance of an integrated architecture for
   both device-specific and network-wide policy (configuration)
   management which is fully integrated with the Internet Standard
   Management Framework.

   The Differentiated Services MIB module [RFC3289] operates on a device
   level.  The MIB module in this memo, the DIFFSERV-CONFIG-MIB, creates
   a coherent configuration management view as an umbrella over
   [RFC3289].  That is, the DIFFSERV-CONFIG-MIB provides a conceptual
   API for configuration of Differentiated Services parameters. Since
   the Differentiated Services MIB module is able to maintain
   configuration information, the DIFFSERV-CONFIG-MIB configuration API
   consists only of configuration template information and the start of
   the so-called functional datapath.


3.  Other Documents

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Differentiated
   Services ([RFC2474] and [RFC2475]), the Policy-based Management MIB
   ([PMMIBDR]) and the BCP entitled "Configuring Networks and Devices
   With SNMP" ([RFC3512]).  These documents include all of the necessary

Internet Draft  Differentiated Services Configuration MIB      June 2003






   terminology for understanding this memo.  [RFC3512] also provides an
   example MIB module which may help in understanding the relationship
   between DIFFSERV-CONFIG-MIB and the Differentiated Services MIB in
   [RFC3289].


4.  Relationship to other MIBs

   In this section we describe the relationship of this MIB module to
   other MIB modules.  The overall architecture used for policy
   configuration management is described in [PMMIBDR].


4.1.  The Policy-based Management MIB module

   [PMMIBDR] defines a MIB module that enables policy-based
   configuration management of infrastructure using the Internet
   Standard Management Framework.  The document includes a table for
   configuring policies to be implemented, tables for storing the roles
   of elements on a particular device, a table for representing the
   capabilities of a device with respect to policy management, a table
   for referencing elements affected by a policy, as well as other
   infrastructure.

   See [PMMIBDR] for a full description of the policy-based
   configuration framework it provides.


4.2.  The Differentiated Services MIB module

   The Differentiated Services MIB module [RFC3289] provides a common
   set of managed objects useful for configuring Differentiated Services
   parameters on a Differentiated Services capable device. This is what
   is referred to as instance-level configuration. It is the alteration
   of the instance-level information in that MIB module which may be
   done via the objects provided by the Differentiated Services
   Configuration MIB module defined in this memo.

   It is recognized that vendors may include additional managed objects
   in their devices (via vendor-specific MIB modules) for configuring
   Differentiated Services parameters. If a vendor chooses to use the
   objects defined in this memo for configuration, the vendor should
   provide additional managed objects in a similar approach as defined
   for the Differentiated Services MIB module.

Internet Draft  Differentiated Services Configuration MIB      June 2003






   Since the managed objects of the Differentiated Services MIB
   [RFC3289] are not directly associated with an instance (interface and
   interface direction), the same managed objects can be used for
   traffic treatment configuration templates in a Differentiated
   Services capable device and can then be applied on multiple
   instances.  Therefore, the tables as defined in the Differentiated
   Services MIB can directly be used for template configuration
   purposes.  Those tables are:

       - diffServClfrTable
       - diffServClfrElementTable
       - diffServMultiFieldClfrTable
       - diffServMeterTable
       - diffServTBParamTable
       - diffServActionTable
       - diffServDscpMarkActTable
       - diffServCountActTable
       - diffServAlgDropTable
       - diffServRandomDropTable
       - diffServQTable
       - diffServSchedulerTable
       - diffServMinRateTable
       - diffServMaxRateTable

   Readers familiar with the Differentiated Services MIB will notice
   that these are all templates.  Only the diffServDataPathTable defines
   a managed instance for Differentiated Services traffic treatment by
   its indexes of the interface and its interface direction.  This also
   allows the tables mentioned above to be used as a configuration
   template without defining anything directly related to a managed
   instance.


5.  The Differentiated Services Configuration MIB module design

   The Differentiated Services Configuration MIB module (in this memo)
   of the SNMP-based configuration management framework is positioned
   between the Policy-based Management MIB module and the instance-
   specific Differentiated Services MIB module as described above.

   The MIB module found in this memo is designed to maintain
   configuration templates for the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289]
   module.  The module only has a template table that describes a
   Differentiated Services traffic treatment by providing the starting
   pointer of the functional datapath.  The templates represent a





SNMPCONF WG               Expires December 2003                 [Page 6]
 
Internet Draft  Differentiated Services Configuration MIB      June 2003






   specific configuration of traffic treatment in a functional datapath
   of a Differentiated Services capable device. To avoid duplication of
   managed objects, the actual templates defining the functional
   datapath are defined in the Differentiated Services MIB module.
   These are also used for the management of the instances. Therefore,
   the implementation of the DIFFSERV-CONFIG-MIB module uses the tables
   defined in the Differentiated Services MIB.  As soon as a
   configuration is made active via the POLICY-MANAGEMENT-MIB, the
   configuration defined within this MIB module will be instantiated in
   the DIFFSERV-MIB.

   Note that this is a conceptual process. That is, the configuration
   may not actually go through an API available in the subsystem which
   implements the DIFFSERV-MIB module.  However, configuration via the
   DIFFSERV-CONFIG-MIB module will alter the same instrumentation as the
   DIFFSERV-MIB module whether it does it via the DIFFSERV-MIB module or
   not.

   The Differentiated Services Configuration MIB module only needs to
   define a starting point of a traffic treatment configuration
   template. This table is similar to the diffServDataPathTable
   [RFC3289]. However, it has a semantic difference in that the
   diffServDataPathTable is associated with an instance (interface and
   interface direction), whereas the diffServConfigTable in this memo is
   not.

   Unlike most MIB modules, changes to the managed objects in this MIB
   module do not cause a change in the device.  This MIB module is used
   to set up per-hop-behavior configurations. As soon as configurations
   are made active via the POLICY-MANAGEMENT-MIB, the configurations
   defined within this MIB module will be instantiated in the DIFFSERV-
   MIB.

   The only table in this MIB module is the diffServConfigTable, which
   provides managed objects for registering traffic treatment
   configurations used in differentiated services. The sole purpose of
   this table is to provide the starting point for a traffic treatment
   configuration template.  The traffic treatment itself is performed by
   functional datapath elements [RFC3289].


6.  Template cloning

   The concept of the DIFFSERV-CONFIG-MIB is based on having traffic
   treatment configuration templates. The templates provide a set of





SNMPCONF WG               Expires December 2003                 [Page 7]
 
Internet Draft  Differentiated Services Configuration MIB      June 2003






   configuration values that provide a certain behavior, such as EF
   traffic treatment, in the functional datapath.  The template (or
   functional datapath) is similar to a linked list from a starting
   point and each (functional datapath) element is connected to the next
   element via a so-called the element.

   The moment a template is activated (instantiated) on an interface and
   its interface direction, the template needs to be copied/cloned, so
   that the template remains as a template.  If the template is no
   longer available as a template after an instantiation, the management
   station has to set up a new equivalent template, and the object
   amplification of configuration with SNMP is gone.

   A literal copy/clone of the template would not be possible, since the
   same indexes inside the element tables cannot be re-used. The
   instantiation process must therefore generate a new index for each
   element. As a result of this, the 'NEXT' pointers also need to be
   updated. Otherwise, those will point to the template.


6.1.  An Approach to Template Cloning

   What should a system containing Differentiated Services capabilities
   and Differentiated Services configuration capabilities do
   conceptually at the moment a template is activated on an interface?
   The following order or approach should not be considered
   implementation guidelines, but rather a conceptual explanation of
   what should be done.

     1) Get the index of the template to be activated
     2) Get RowPointer (current) from
           diffServConfigStart.index
           of the diffServConfigTable
     3) Check if RowPointer (current) exists
     4) Copy/Clone the entry pointed to by RowPointer
           a) Get a new index for the entry
           b) Configure the new entry with the values
              of the entry to be cloned
           c) Update the NEXT pointer with a new RowPointer
              that pointed to the previous entry that was copied
              part of this template
     5) Store RowPointer of cloned entry as previous
     6) Get the RowPointer of the next element in the template
        as current
     7) If current RowPointer does not equal zeroDotZero go to 4

6.2.  Example

   This section provides an example of the process described in the
   previous section. This example will show a Differentiated Services
   capable incoming (ingress) interface that only counts the traffic
   stream. Then, with the policy-based configuration concept as defined
   in this document and in [PMMIBDR], a traffic marking configuration
   will be applied.  The example will walk the reader through all of the
   steps involved in this process.

      NOTE WELL:  For brevity and clarity, the example does not always
      show the complete entry (row) of a table. The only objects shown
      are those needed for creating the row pointers to the next
      functional datapath element or needed to provide information about
      the specific parameters of the functional datapath elements.  The
      column named 'INDEX' always defines the complete index as defined
      for the associated entry. In some cases this is a combined index
      of multiple components. Therefore, the names of the columns are
      omitted.


6.2.1.  The initial situation

   The initial configuration is the existing configuration of an ingress
   interface.

      +------------------------------------------------------------+
      |   ingress functional datapath                              |
      |                        +----------+                        |
   -->|----------->----------->| count    |----------->----------->|-->
      |                        +----------+                        |
      +------------------------------------------------------------+

   This figure depicts a simple traffic treatment functional datapath
   for an ingress interface. The functional datapath only consists of a
   count action.

   Within the DIFFSERV-MIB this would be instantiated as follows in the
   appropriate tables. Note that RowPointer objects must point to the
   first accessible columnar object in the conceptual row.  Thus, while
   perhaps more instructive to use the index value for the RowPointer
   object's value (e.g., diffServCountActId.1) in the example, it would
   nonetheless be incorrect, and the first accessible columnar object
   has been used as should be done (e.g., diffServCountActOctets.1).

6.2.2.  The configuration template

   The following provides an example of a policy configuration in which
   traffic is classified by a specific IP filter. That results in two
   classifiers (1 for the IP filter and the match all). Both streams are
   then metered, marked and counted. This is an example of usage on the
   edge (an ingress interface) of an Differentiated Services domain that
   wants to have EF and AF marked traffic within the Differentiated
   Services domain.

6.2.3.  Applying the template

   Now we have the original ingress interface configuration and the
   policy configuration we want to apply to the actual interface.

   The example policy must provide to all interfaces used by system
   administrators the required Differentiated Services traffic
   treatment. The traffic treatment required is described in 6.2.2
   above.





SNMPCONF WG               Expires December 2003                [Page 13]
 
Internet Draft  Differentiated Services Configuration MIB      June 2003






   Therefore, we have the following example policy which is configured
   via the POLICY-BASED-MANAGEMENT-MIB module (see [PMMIBDR]):

   if
      return roleMatch("Administrator")
   then
      /*
       * The $0 gets the "element" returned from the previous
       * statement.  the .2 at the end is the egress interface
       * This sets, for example, diffServDataPathStart.3.2 to be
       * diffServActionNext.1 if interface 3 has the role
       * "Administrator".
       */
      setVar("diffServDataPathStart.$0.2",
              "diffServActionNext.1", Oid)

   For our purposes, we only apply this on the outbound (egress)
   direction on the interface.

   Note that although object descriptors are used in this PolicyScript
   example, the object identifiers must be used in the running script.
   For more information on policies and their syntax refer to [PMMIBDR].

   The following tables of this section provide the cloned entries in
   the tables of the DIFFSERV-MIB module.  NOTE: the original (existing)
   traffic treatment of 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 are also in the tables.

   As one can see in the example, the main elements from which a
   functional datapath are constructed are duplicated/copied/cloned.
   That process is needed in order to preserve the policy configuration
   for reuse at a later time.

   It is up to the SNMP agent to keep track of which network interfaces
   are under policy control and which policy rules are being used. This
   avoids duplication of policy enforcement.  How the agent does this is
   an implementation issue.

   One can see that the old functional datapath configurations stay in
   the MIB module tables. It is up to the SNMP agent implementation to
   decide whether to delete stale entries or keep them.  Garbage
   collection of stale entries is an implementation issue.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
