Internet-Draft           Heterogeneous Handover            February 2006


1.  Introduction

   Handover is a process by which a mobile node moves from one point of
   attachment to another point of attachment in a network.  This
   handover can be primarily classified into homogeneous and
   heterogeneou handover.  Heterogeneous handover includes movement
   between various types of wireless technologies and different
   administrative domains.  Supporting terminal handovers across
   heterogeneous access networks such as CDMA, 802.11 and GPRS is a
   clear challenge, as each access network has different QoS, security
   and bandwidth characteristics.  Similarly movement between two
   different kinds of domains poses a challenge since a mobile will need
   to re-establish authentication and authorization as well in the new
   domain and each administrative domain may or may not have any prior
   security arrangement.  In order to be able to provide an optimized
   handover solution for a heterogeneous handover case, it is essential
   to determine the key functions that contribute to the handover delay.
   Determining these key functions help define the right set of
   mechanisms needed to design an optimized handover framework.  In this
   document, we introduce the concept of heterogeneous handover,
   illustrate the key performance characteristics requirement for a
   real-time communication, cite alternate scenarios that represent a
   heterogeneous handover involving different access technologies and
   different administrative domains.  We discuss several challenges,
   problems and issues that give rise to handover delay, packet loss and
   jitter during the heterogeneous handover.  These issues and problem
   sets can be used as guidelines while designing an optimized
   heterogeneous handover solution.

2.  Handover Taxonomy

   An access network is defined as the backhaul network that provides
   the first hop or last hop access to the mobile in an end-to-end
   communication system.  When a mobile during an active communication
   session moves from one access network to another access network and
   changes its point of attachment it is subjected to disruption in the
   continuity of service.  During the handover, as the mobile changes
   its point-of-attachment in the network a mobile terminal may end up
   communicating using its second interface in the new network, change
   its subnet or domain it is connected to.  Based on the type of
   movement and access network we can primarily define the handover in
   the following ways.  We can define following combination of handovers
   in our analysis.  Primarily these could be categorized as A) Inter-
   subnet and B) Intra-subnet.

   An Inter-subnet Handover can comprise the following combination of
   handover that fall into category A.

   1) Inter-technology, Inter-domain

   2) Inter-technology, Intra-domain

   3) Intra-technology, Inter-domain

   4) Intra-technology, Intra-domain

   An intra-subnet handover can consist of the following types of
   handover that fall into category B.

   1) Intra-Tech, Intra-domain

   2) Inter-Tech, Intra-domain

   Heterogeneous handover is a handover that requires authorization for
   acquisition or modification of resources assigned to a mobile and the
   autorization needs interaction with a central authority in a domain.
   In many cases an authorization procedure in a heterogeneous handover
   follows an authentication procedure that also requires interaction
   with a central authority in a domain.  All the scenarios A-1, A-2,
   A-3, A-4, B-1 and B-2 described above could cover the scope of
   heterogeneous handover.  These will be more clear as we describe
   different types of handoff scenarios in the following sections.

   Figure 1: Handover Taxonomy

   Intra-subnet: When a mobile moves between two radio access networks
   that are part of the same subnet and does not change broadcast
   domain, it is called Intra-subnet handover.  During an intra-subnet
   handover, the mobile may be subjected to an inter-technology handover
   as well if both the access networks with different radio access
   technologies (e.g.,CDMA, 802.11) belong to the same subnet.  However
   during an intra-subnet and inter-technology handover, the effective
   L3 identifier of the terminal may change if the terminal starts to
   communicate using an interface that is part of a different access
   network, since the IP address associated with each interface will be
   different although these addresses belong to the same subnet.

   Inter-subnet: A mobile is subjected to an Inter-subnet handover when
   it moves between two radio access networks that belong to two
   different subnets.  As a result, its L3 identifier (e.g., IP address)
   is changed thus giving rise to a need for any mobility management
   protocol such as Mobile IP [RFC3344], Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], SIP-
   Mobility [SIPMM], HIP [I-D.ietf-hip-base] that can take care of the
   continuity of the existing application.  An Inter-subnet handover can
   be viewed as orthogonal to intra-subnet handoff scenarios and may
   include intra-domain, Inter-domain, Inter-technology or Intra-
   technology handover.  All of these types of handovers are described
   in this document.  Inter-subnet handover potentially gives rise to

Internet-Draft           Heterogeneous Handover            February 2006


   packet loss and jitter because of delay associated with transition at
   layer 2 and layer 3.

   Inter-technology: A mobile may be equipped with multiple interfaces,
   where each interface can support different access technology (802.11,
   CDMA).  A mobile may like to communicate with one interface at any
   time in order to conserve the power.  During the handover the mobile
   may move out of the footprint of one access technology (e.g., 802.11)
   and move into the footprint of a different access technology (e.g.,
   CDMA).  This will warrant switching of the communicating interface on
   the mobile as well.  This type of Inter-technology handover is often
   called as Vertical Handover since the mobile makes movement between
   two different cell sizes.  A vertical handover can be termed as
   upward vertical handover or downward vertical handover based on the
   direction of movement such as smaller cell to larger cell or vice
   versa [vertical].  A mobile moving from 802.11 network to cellullar
   network can be viewed as upward vertical handover.  An inter-
   technology handover may affect the quality-of-service of the
   multimedia communication, since each access network offers different
   bandwidth.

   Intra-technology: An intra-technology handover is defined when a
   mobile moves between the same type of access technology such as
   between 802.11[a,b,n] and 802.11 [a,b,n] or between CDMA1XRTT and
   CDMA1EVDO.  In this scenario a mobile may be equipped with a single
   interface (with multiple PHY types of the same technology) or with
   multiple interfaces.  An Intra-technology handover may involve intra-
   subnet or inter-subnet movement and thus may need to change its L3
   identifier depending upon type of movement.  An intra-technology
   handover may involve networks with different access characteristics
   and thus may very well belong to heterogeneous handover category.
   However a handover between 802.11b networks if these belong to same
   subnet or domain may not be termed as heterogeneous handover.

   Inter-domain: A domain can be defined in several ways.  But for the
   purposes of roaming we define domain as an administrative domain
   which consists of networks that are managed by a single
   administrative entity which authenticates and authorizes a mobile for
   accessing the networks.  An administrative entity may be a service
   provider, an enterprise and any organization.  As a mobile moves
   between two administrative domains, it is also subjected to inter-
   subnet handover, as two different domains exclusively have two
   different subnets.  Thus an Inter-domain handover will by-default be
   subjected to inter-subnet handover and in addition it may be
   subjected to either inter-technology or intra-technology handover.
   Inter-domain handover will be sujected to all the transition steps a
   subnet handover goes through in addition to an authentication
   process.  These extra steps contribute to additional delay on the top

   of delays due to regular subnet handover.

   Intra-domain: When a mobile's movement is confined to movement within
   an administrative domain it is called intra-domain movement.  An
   intra-domain movement may involve intra-subnet, inter-subnet, intra-
   technology and inter-technlogy as well.

3.  Performance Requirements

   In order to provide desirable quality of service for interactive VoIP
   and streaming traffic, one needs to limit the value of end-to-end
   delay, jitter and packet loss to a certain threshold level.  ITU-T
   and ITU-R standards define the acceptable values for these
   parameters.  For example for one-way delay, ITU-T G.114 recommends
   150 ms as the upper limit for most of the applications, and 400 ms as
   generally unacceptable delay.  One way delay tolerance for video
   conferencing is in the range of 200 to 300 ms.  Also if an out-of-
   order packet is received after a certain threshold it is considered
   lost.  References [RFC2679], [RFC2680] and 2681 [RFC2681] describe
   some of the measurement techniques for delay and jitter.

   An end-to-end delay consists of several components, such as network
   delay, operating system (OS) delay, CODEC delay and application
   delay.  Network delay consists of transmission delay, propagation
   delay, queueing delay in the intermediate routers.  Operating System
   related delay consists of scheduling behavior of the operating system
   in the sender and receiver.  CODEC delay is generally caused due to
   packetization and depacketization at the sender and receiver end.
   Different CODECs will give rise to different delay, for example G.729
   encodes speech at 8 Kbps and adds one-way delay of about 25 ms.
   Application delay is mainly attributed to playout delay that helps
   compensate the delay variation within a network.  End-to-end delay
   and jitter values can be adjusted using proper value of the playout
   buffer at the receiver end.  In case of interactive VoIP traffic,
   end-to-end delay affects the jitter value and is an important issue
   to consider.  During a mobile's frequent handover, transient traffic
   cannot reach the mobile and this may contribute to jitter even if the
   packet loss is avoided by means of buffering or some other forwarding
   mechanism.  If the end system has a playout buffer, then this jitter
   is subsumed by the playout buffer delay, but otherwise this adds to
   the delay for interactive traffic.  Packet loss is typically caused
   by congestion, routing instability, link failure, lossy links such as
   wireless links.  During a mobile's handover a mobile is subjected to
   packet loss because of its change in attachment to the network.  Thus
   for both streaming traffic and VoIP interactive traffic packet loss
   will contribute to the service quality of the real-time application.
   Number of packets lost is proportional to the delay during handover
   and rate of traffic the mobile is receiving.  Lost packets contribute
   to congestion in case of TCP traffic because of re-transmission, but
   it does not add to any congestion in case of streaming traffic that
   is RTP/UDP based.  Thus it is essential to reduce the packet loss and
   effect of handover delay in any mobility management scheme.

   We provide some instances of performance requirement here.  The
   performance requirement will vary based on the type of application



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 30, 2006                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           Heterogeneous Handover            February 2006


   and its characteristics such as delay tolerance and loss tolerance
   limit.  Interactive traffic such as VoIP and streaming traffic will
   have different tolerance for delay and packet loss.  For example,
   according to ETSI TR 101 [ETSI] a normal voice conversation can
   tolerate up to 2% packet loss.  If a mobile is subjected to frequent
   handover during a conversation, each handover will contribute to
   packet loss for the period of handover.  Thus maximum loss during a
   conversation needs to be reduced to an acceptable level.  There is no
   clear threshold value for packet loss for streaming application, but
   it needs to be reduced as much as possible to provide better quality
   of service to a specific application.  Similarly there are other
   factors such as Transmission Rating Factor (R), End to End delay (one
   way mouth-to-ear) and Call blocking ratio that are some of the
   parameters that determine the QoS metrics.  R factor is standardized
   by ITU-T G.107.  R value is based on E Model.  An R value of 50 is
   considered to be poor and a value of 90 can be considered as the best
   that provides most user satisfaction.  As an example, a class B QoS
   which is equivalent to cellular telephony has a R factor that is
   greater than 70, E2E delay of less than 150 ms and call blocking
   ratio which is less than or equal to 0.15.  Class A QoS that is the
   highest and is equivalent to fixed phone quality has an R value that
   is more than 80, E2E delay that is less than 100 ms.  Similarly, 3GPP
   TS23.107 defines 4 classes: conversational, streaming, interactive
   and background.  The streaming class has the packet (SDU) error rates
   ranging from 0.1 to 0.00001 and the transfer delay of less than
   300ms.  On the other hand, in ITU-T Y.1541, streaming is categorized
   as Class 4 out of existing 6 classes, where the upper bound of the
   transfer delay is 1 sec and the upper bound of packet loss ratio is
   0.001, thus its delay tolerance is more than that of 3GPP's.  The
   delay variation is not specified in this class.  On the other hand
   different vendor products suggest values up to 3 to 4 sec as
   tolerance value for the streaming traffic.

4.  Handover Delay Analysis

   This section analyzes the handover delay associated with
   heterogeneous handover and the factors that contribute to this.  As a
   mobile goes through a heterogeneous handover process, it is subjected
   to handover delay because of the rebinding of properties at several
   layers of the protocol stack.  There are several common properties
   that may contribute to the re-establishment or modification of these
   layers.  These properties can mostly be attributed to things such as
   access characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, channel characteristics),
   access mechanism (e.g.  CDMA, CSMA/CA, TDMA), configuration of layer
   3 parameters, re-authentication, re-authorization, rebinding of
   security association at all layers.

   During any handover procedure any multimedia application running
   within a client gets affected because of the delays incurred within
   each of the layers of the protocol stack.  In the next subsections we
   provide analysis of several sub-components that give rise to the
   delay within each layer.

4.1.  Layer 2 delay

   Depending upon the access type (e.g., 802.11, CDMA), the mobile goes
   through several transition steps, before the new layer 2 link is re-
   established.  As an example an 802.11 link goes through the process
   of scanning, authentication and association during the reattachment
   to the new 802.11 access point.  Similarly other access networks such
   as CDMA and GPRS networks go through a series of state transitions
   during their reassociation to the new point of attachment.  Each of
   these state transitions contributes to certain delays as the mobile
   goes through each of these intra-layer transitions.  After a new
   layer 2 link is established, depending upon the type of handover
   scenario, other layers in the protocol need to go through the
   rebinding process.  For example in case of intra-technology, intra-
   subnet handover, there is no other layer besides layer 2 that is
   affected and the handover delay is attributed to the delay due to
   layer 2 transitions only.

   Even in the case of handoff consisting of intra-domain, intra-
   technology, intra-subnet handoff where there is layer 2 delay only,
   an authentication and authorization procedure needs to be performed
   when switching to the new access network.  The procedure may take
   more steps if layer-2 characteristics such as QoS characteristics are
   different betweeen the old and new access networks than the case
   where layer-2 chatersteristics are the same betweeen the old and new
   access networks.  So the difference of layer-2 access characteristics
   can qualify a intra-technology handover as a heterogeneous handover
   as well.  Hence the scenario B-1 may also qualify to be a



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 30, 2006               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           Heterogeneous Handover            February 2006


   heterogeneous handover as it may involve movement between 802.11b and
   802.11n network or between CDMA1XRTT or CDMA1XEVDO networks.  In case
   of movement between 802.11 type networks EAP authentication and 4-way
   handshake involving 802.11i can also add delay.  Similarly in case of
   handoff between CDMA2000 family networks authentication procedure
   such as CHAP for PPP session may add to the layer 2 delay.

4.2.  Layer 3 Delay

   A layer 3 transition process goes through several steps such as new
   IP address acquisition, duplicate address detection, ARP update, and
   local authentication.  Similarly a successful local authentication
   allows the mobile to send packets beyond the first hop router and may
   add delay to the handover process.  For example in some cases there
   is some authorization process involved even before a new IP address
   is obtained.  Methods of IP address acquisition are different based
   on if it is IPv4, IPv6 and access network is LAN or WAN.  There are
   several protocols such as DHCP, DHCPv6, PPP or stateless
   autoconfiguration that can be used to take care of IP address
   acquisition.  Each of these methods may take different amount of time
   for a layer 3 transition to complete.  After a layer 3 transition is
   complete and layer 3 address is re-established, there are certain
   functions in the upper layer that need to be completed.  These
   include functions such as sending the binding update from the mobile,
   media redirection at the sending host.  Delays incurred due to these
   functions can be attributed to transport delay, processing delay at
   the end hosts etc.  In the inter-subnet, intra-domain mobility
   category an authentication procedure is needed to obtain and use the
   IP address in the new subnet.  But inter-subnet, inter-domain
   mobility may need additional authorization process.  For example
   during an interdomain movement that includes MIPv4 as the binding
   protocol, AAA interaction will contribute to additional delay.

   In a typical inter-domain mobility scenario independent of inter-
   technology or intra-technology handoff, an authentication and
   authorization procedure need to be executed for establishing layer 2
   and layer 3 properties from scratch in the new domain.  This can be
   an extraordinally undesired delay component during handoff.
   References [multinetwork], [hybrid], [interdomain] are few examples
   of inter-subnet handover involving inter-domain mobility that provide
   some case studies.  If the inter-subnet handover involves inter-
   domain mobility, then the delay introduced due to authentication and
   authorization procedure adds to the handover latency and consequently
   affects the ongoing multimedia sessions.  The authentication and
   authorization procedure may include EAP authentication where an AAA
   server may be involved in EAP messaging during the handover.
   Depending upon the type of architecture, in some cases the AAA
   signals traverse all the way to the AAA server in the home domain of

   the mobile as well before the network service is granted to the
   mobile in the new network.  Thus it is desirable that interactions
   between the mobile and AAA servers must be avoided or be reduced
   during the handover.  By way of expedited registrations, these
   interaction can be reduced.  But it is more desirable if these can be
   avoided altogether during the handover itself.

4.3.  Application Layer Delay

   Application layer delay is the delay needed to re-establish or modify
   application layer properties involving end-to-end applications such
   as SIP specific sessions .  Application layer binding update or any
   other mid-session signaling thus can be regarded as application layer
   delay.  By way of application layer signaling any mid-session info
   such as IP address, codec parameters can also be changed.

5.  Optimizing Handover Delay

   It is evident from the analysis provided in the previous section that
   a mobile is subjected to different amount of delay based on the types
   of handover it is subjected to.  For example an intra-subnet, intra-
   technology handover will take much less time than inter-subnet and
   inter-technology handover, because the mobile goes through a less
   number of state transitions during the handover process.  Thus there
   are certain common properties such as characteristics of the access
   network, security association at each layers of the protocol stack
   during re-attachment, ways of layer 3 binding (e.g., obtaining IP
   address, binding update, media redirection), authorization,
   authentication in the new network play an important role to determine
   the overall handover delay.  But the required steps can be minimized
   if already established security contexts in the domain are utilized
   for the procedure.  Thus without any optimization technique, any type
   of heterogeneous handover will be subjected to higher handover delay
   compared to complete homogeneous handover (e.g.,a combination of
   intra-technology (802.11b - 802.11b), intra-domain, intra-subnet).

   Thus it is desirable to devise a mechanism or framework that helps
   reduce these handover delays either by executing these state
   transitions in parallel or completing some of these proactively ahead
   of time.  A simple example may be to reduce the handover delay by
   completing the authentication and authorization ahead of time prior
   to the movement into the new network.  Additional level of
   optimizations for other layer 2 and layer 3 related operation may
   also be possible.  In some cases lower layer hints may help to
   optimize upper layer delays as well.  There are several optimized
   mobility management solutions at different layers, [RFC4068],
   [RFC4140],[I-D.ohba-mobopts-mpa-framework], [SIPFAST], currently
   proposed that attempt to reduce these handover delay and mitigate the
   effect of handover delay.

   In case of intra-domain movement, it might be possible to give
   authorization to the mobile on the use of every access network within
   the domain at the time of mobile's initial entry to the domain so
   that no additional authorization is required for each heterogeneous
   movement as well as homogeneous movement.  This approach still needs
   authentication for each access network in the domain during mobile's
   movement to make sure that the entity attaching to the access network
   is the authorized mobile.  Pre-authentication will help minimize such
   post-movement authentication delay for such an approach as well.  For
   example during a movement to a CDMA1xEVDO network, a PPP connection
   cannot be set up until user authentication is complete using
   procedures such as CHAP or PAP with all the way to a AAA server in
   the home or a visited domain.  In order to make the handover to a new
   PPP network faster pre-authentication using CHAP and PAP can take

   time.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the problem statement and issues associated
   with heterogeneous handover.  Any framework supporting optimized
   heterogeneous handover will need to make sure that the signaling and
   data are properly secured during the handover.  This security
   mechanism can be provided at any layer of the protocol stack.
