   optimize the utilization of network resource. And this document 
   includes discussion about the considerations and necessity of the

1. Introduction  
    
   According to the recent rapidly increasing of IP traffic, Wavelength 
   Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology is rapidly becoming a 
   technology-of-choice to meet the tremendous bandwidth demand of IP 
   traffic. 
   Traffic Engineering (TE) of an IP network is concerned with 
   performance optimization of operational networks and mapping the flow 
   of traffic to present a physical topology of network. A major goal of 
   Internet Traffic Engineering is to facilitate efficient and reliable 
   network operations while simultaneously optimizing network resource 
   utilization and traffic performance [5]. 
   But because the attributes of present IP routing protocols have been 
   poor, the supplementary means for traffic engineering over GMPLS must 
   be prepared. 
   To overcome this problem, two schemes of research for traffic 
   engineering in IP networks have been introduced û one scheme is able 
   to control explicitly the data path and other scheme is the adaptive 
   load balancing of usable path û the results of these research came to 
   produce MPLS technology for traffic engineering in IP networks and a 
   GMPLS technology added control plane of IP for introducing the 
   traffic engineering over MPLS in WDM networks. For introducing the 
   traffic engineering over GMPLS, We can consider two schemes, one is 
   the extended routing protocol for traffic engineering and the other 
   scheme is the allocation of traffic through a network resource 
   database for the efficient utilization of network resource. 
   This document describes the latter scheme that allocates the traffic 
   to the network resource through the construction of the network state 
   information database. 
   In this document we define the network state information database 
   (NSID) that support traffic engineering database(TED) for the 
   function of traffic engineering and management information base (MIB) 
   for the function of network maintenance. The main function of the 
   network state information database is the control and management of 
   network state information data. 
    
1.1 Terminology 
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the GMPLS terminology as 
   defined in [3][11]. 
   
1.2 Document organization  
    
   The reminder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2 
   provides the requirement of Traffic Engineering over GMPLS and 
   section 3 presents an overlay and integrated model in the view of 
   Traffic Engineering. Section 4 presents the overview of the 
   characteristics and requirements of GMPLS architecture required for 
   an extended overlay and integrated model. Section 5 describes the 
   necessity and structural elements of a network state information

   database and the implementation consideration. Finally, Section 6 
   contains concluding remarks. 
    
    
2. Traffic Engineering over GMPLS  
    
   This section describes the Traffic Engineering objectives in GMPLS 
   and when traffic engineering of MPLS is extended to optical network, 
   the correlation of optical resources and requirements in traffic 
   mapping is presented. 
    
    
2.1 Traffic Engineering Performance Objectives in GMPLS 
    
   The key performance objectives associated with traffic engineering in 
   GMPLS can be classified as being either in MPLS [4]:  
    
   - traffic oriented or 
   - resource oriented 
    
   Traffic Oriented Performance Objectives include the aspects that 
   enhance the QoS traffic streams. In the present Internet network 
   providing best effort service, the key traffic oriented performance 
   objectives can include: minimization of packet loss, minimization of 
   delay, maximization of throughput, and enforcement of service level 
   agreement. These elements are used in optical networks as well as in 
   the IP network. 
   Resource Oriented Performance Objectives include the aspects 
   pertaining to the optimization of resource utilization. Efficient 
   management of network resources, such that subsets of network 
   resources do not become over utilized and congested while other 
   subnets along alternate feasible paths remain underutilized, is the 
   vehicle for the attainment of Resource Oriented Performance 
   Objectives. Bandwidth is a crucial resource in contemporary networks, 
   but in the consideration of optical networks the key resource 
   oriented performance objectives can include: the number of 
   wavelengths, the number of Optical Crossconnects (OXC), the number of 
   fibers, and the number of optical transceivers. 
   For the enhancement of resource oriented performance congestion 
   control, load balancing can be chosen. The objective of load 
   balancing is to minimize maximum congestion or alternatively to 
   minimize maximum resource utilization, through efficient resource 
   allocation. Also for the maximization of resource performance 
   resource management is needed. For the resource management it is 
   necessary to construct the resource control signal and network state 
   information database that is able to manage the network resource 
   through the control signal. 
   Some key extensions brought by GMPLS to MPLS TE are highlighted in 
   the following [3].

   1) In MPLS-TE, links traversed by a Label Switched Path (LSP) can 
   include an intermix of links with heterogeneous label encoding (e.g. 
   links between routers, links between routers and ATM-LSRs, and links 
   between ATM-LSRs). GMPLS extended this by including links where the 
   label is encoded as a timeslot, or wavelength, or fiber. 
   In MPLS-TE, an LSP that carries IP has to start and end on a router. 
   GMPLS extends this by requiring LSP to start and end on several types 
   of Label Switching Routers (LSR) capable of several kinds of labels. 
   Therefore the type of a payload that can be carried in GMPLS by LSP 
   is extended to allow such payloads as SONET/SDH, G.709, 1GbE or 10GbE, 
   etc. 
   The use of Forwarding Adjacencies (FA) that can improve bandwidth 
   utilization is considered. When bandwidth allocation can be performed 
   only in discrete units, FA allows the number of required labels to be 
   reduced. 
   GMPLS allows for a label to be suggested by an upstream node to 
   reduce the setup latency and to limit the range of labels that is 
   selected by the downstream node. This feature is useful in photonic 
   networks where wavelength conversion may not be available. 
   While traditional TE-based (and even LDP-based) LSPs are 
   unidirectional, GMPLS supports the bi-directional LSPs. This feature 
   will be useful in resource management. 
   GMPLS supports the termination of LSP on a specific egress port, i.e. 
   the port selection at the destination node. 
   For TDM, Label Switching Capable (LSC) and Fiber Switching Capable 
   (FSC) interfaces in GMPLS, bandwidth allocation for an LSP can be 
   performed only in indiscrete units. 
   There are much fewer labels on TDM, LSC, FSC than on PSC or L2SC 
   links, because the former are physical labels instead of logical 
   labels. Therefore resource oriented traffic engineering is needed. 
   There are basically three fundamental problems of traffic mapping in 
   MPLS: mapping packets onto forwarding equivalent classes, mapping 
   forwarding equivalent classes onto traffic trunks, and mapping 
   traffic trunks onto the physical network topology through LSP. But in 
   GMPLS including optical resources there are some problems of 
   hierarchical LSP with how to map traffic trunks onto lambda, and how 
   LSP is mapped onto lambda. The hierarchical mapping stage to optical 
   switching is depicted in Figure 1.

3. GMPLS Architecture for Traffic Engineering 
    
   In this section, the basic framework for proposed traffic engineering 
   can allocate optical resources on demand and wavelength assignment 
   and network reconfiguration is focused. Main functions of these 
   frameworks consist in the following stages [7].

3.1  Network State Monitoring and Analysis Stage 
    
   This stage is responsible for collecting traffic statistics from the 
   network elements. Then statistics are analyzed for the traffic 
   engineering and network reconfiguration related decision-making.

3.2  Required Resource Estimation Stage 
    
   This stage estimates the resources, i.e. wavelength, the bandwidth of 
   each wavelength, in the near future based on past and present 
   measurement and collection and analysis of traffic characteristics. 
    
    
3.3  Reconfiguration Decision Stage 
    
   This stage consists of a series of operations that decides when a 
   network level reconfiguration is performed for the resource 
   allocation from the resource estimation stage. This decision element 
   is based on traffic conditions, the number of network resources, and 
   other operational issues, e.g., suppressing the influence of 
   transitional factors and reserving adequate time for network to 
   converge. 
   Network reconfiguration can be triggered when any element value 
   exceeds the thresholds.  
    
    
3.4 Logical Topology Design and Modification Stage 
    
   This stage computes a network topology based on the measurement and 
   predictions about the traffic state and network resource. This can be 
   considered as optimizing a layered graph (i.e. IP routers connected 
   by lights in the WDM layers) for specific objectives (e.g. minimum 
   hops and maximizing throughput), subject to certain constraints (e.g. 
   nodal degree, interface capacity), for a given load matrix (i.e. 
   traffic load applied to the network), which in general is a NP-
   complete problem. 
   Since network reconfiguration can be triggered by periodically 
   changing traffic pattern, a practical approach is to develop methods 
   that focus on cost-effective, fast convergence, and/or minimal 
   impacts on ongoing traffic in the view of global optimality. There 
   are two methods considered. One method is that sub-TLV that can 
   become aware of the optical characteristics added to the present IP 
   routing protocol and the other method is that signaling protocol of 
   IP network is introduced to the optical network so that network 
   topology is changed. 
    
    
3.5  Network Topology Migration Stage 
    
   This stage consists of algorithms to schedule the network migration 
   from old topology to a new topology. Even if WDM layer resources are 
   sufficient to support the allocation of resource and the change of 
   network resource, there are still other issues concerning the 
   migration. For example, as WDM reconfiguration deals with large-

                  draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-00.txt         June 2002 
 
 
   capacity channels, changing allocation of resources in this coarse 
   granularity has significant effects on a large number of end user 
   traffic. The Procedure of reconfiguration resource for topology 
   migrations is rising to critical issues. In general a migration 
   procedure consists of a sequence of establishing and taking down 
   individual WDM light paths. Traffic flows have to adapt to the light 
   path changes during and after each migration stage. The algorithm is 
   needed so that network configuration gives minimal change on present 
   network state. 
    
    
4. GMPLS Architecture for Traffic Engineering in Overlay Model  
    
   In the overlay model traffic engineering over MPLS is extended to 
   GMPLS using the system architecture based IP control [9]. 
    
   In the MPLS network, the router is required to add sub-TLV related 
   optical attributes to traditional IGP routing protocol to perceive 
   and control the state of optical resources [12]. The Network State 
   Information Database (NSID) is required to control and manage the 
   information of network topology and resources in the optical network. 
   The update routing protocol manages the whole state of IP and optical 
   networks and passes the change of state information to Traffic 
   Engineering Database (TED) of MPLS [8].

   FIGURE 3.The Architecture of traffic Engineering in Overlay Model 
    
   According to the architecture of GMPLS in the overlay model, the 
   optical network consists of four modules as followings:  
   -  WDM Network Control and Management Module inform the state of the 
   optical network to the routing protocol of MPLS and manage the 
   optical network by using the control signal.  
   -  Resource Control Module manages optical resources and topology 
   information for traffic engineering.  
   -  Light Path Connection Module establishes and releases the light 
   path, selects the optical fiber. 
   -  The Protection and Restoration Module provides fast restoration 
   through the protection and restoration algorithms. 
    
      And the Resource Control Module has the function of managing 
   limited resources attributes and network topology by using the 
   network state information database that is created by the Routing and 
   Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithm and control signal and the 
   function of informing the change of optical resources to the MPLS 
   domain through the WDM Network Control and Management Module. Also 
   the Resource Control Module informs the available optical resources 
   to Light Path Connection Module so that the table of light path can 
   be maintained. 
    
   In the optical domain the WDM Network Control and Management Module 
   takes charge of establishing and releasing the light path from the 
   Light Path Connection Module by using the control signal and informs 
   the values of change related to resource information to the Resource

   Control Module. The WDM Network Control and Management Module reports 
   the faults to the Protection and Restoration Module so that the 
   restoration algorithm is active and the Protection and Restoration 
   Module reports the fault information to the Resource Control Module 
   so that new resources are allocated. 
    
5. GMPLS Architecture for Traffic Engineering in Integrated Model 
    
   The architecture of an integrated GMPLS model has an IP addressed 
   system for traffic engineering and a lambda router is needed to 
   completely support the network control and traffic management of the 
   MPLS and optical network [9]. Also it is necessary to introduce the 
   Wavelength-MIB to consist of information about not only fibers but 
   also wavelength and wavelength continuity/interchange constraints of 
   each node. And for the Wavelength-MIB network control consists of 
   three modules [7]: wavelength routing, wavelength signaling, and 
   wavelength access control. The wavelength routing module needs an 
   update link-state protocol with suitable optical layer extensions. 
   The wavelength signaling module fulfills wavelength routing decisions 
   achieved by the wavelength routing module to perform wavelength 
   assignment, setup/teardown optical light path, priority arbitration 
   with preemption, and adaptive QoS with QoS negotiation. The 
   implementation approach of wavelength routing needs to be optical 
   layer extended RSVP or CR-LDP. The wavelength access control module 
   manages the physical connection between the MPLS router and lambda 
   router, and map MPLS label to wavelength. For traffic engineering, 
   each system needs to be equipped with migration scheduling of network 
   topology, reconfiguration algorithm, and statistics collection and 
   analysis. Also the network state information database should be 
   constructed to manage the integrated domain of IP and WDM for 
   maintenance of resources change. For traffic engineering in the 
   integrated model, the construction of centralized traffic engineering 
   needs to manage wavelength-MIB in the optical layer and IP-MIB in the 
   IP layer to strictly manage traffic and network control. 
    
6. Network State Information Database for GMPLS 
    
   The network state information database is needed for the control and 
   management of the MPLS and optical network. The network state 
   information database is constructed and maintained based on the 
   traffic-engineering model and application method described in section 
   4. For example, in the integrated model an entire integrated network 
   state information database is collected from each site and is 
   centralized; in the overlay model the MPLS traffic engineering 
   database and optical network state information database are stored, 
   maintained, and managed separately. 
   The network state information database is involved with two aspects: 
   resources and their usage. Conventional representation of network 
   resources can be simply just the topological information. However,

   traffic engineering requires more information, e.g. total bandwidth, 
   and current usage on each link. 
   Traffic engineering in an optical layer is interested in not only the 
   utilization status of network resources but also the optical 
   characteristics of wavelength connections and signal quality. When 
   overlay traffic engineering is attempted, the objectives functions at 
   different layers may even be different. In the case of integrated 
   traffic engineering, traffic control and resource allocation are 
   considered together so that optimization objectives must be 
   coordinated. 
   Although different traffic engineering models require different 
   design and implementation of network state information database, many 
   common attributes are shared in both cases as discussed in this 
   section. The attributes of MPLS traffic engineering are extended to 
   include the attributes of an optical network. Requirement of common 
   attributes and extended attributes are classified and elements of 
   each attribute and application scheme are observed. 
    
6.1 Resource Attribute 
    
   When the resource attribute for state information of network topology 
   is extended to the optical network, optical resources can be included 
   in this attribute as followings [10]: 
   -  end to end BER  
   -  the number of wavebands and wavelengths per link 
   -  the number of LSP, traffic trunk per wavelength 
   -  wavelength, LSP coloring 
   -  bandwidth of link, wavelength, and LSP and their usage 
   -  min, max of current usage related to link, wavelength, LSP 
   -  the number of optical transceivers in optical system 
    
   In the view of traffic engineering, the optimal allocation of 
   physical and logical optical resources is an important element in 
   determining the performance of the network and this information about 
   resources is fundamental to the network state information database. 
   Also Resource Class Attributes can be used to specify the class of 
   resources and depend on the quality of the optical resources û for 
   example, the quality of the light path, end-to-end BER attributes can 
   be an element to determine the quality of optical resources- which 
   become an important requirement for differentiated services and these 
   are applied differently according to policy attributes. 
    
    
6.2 Policy Attribute 
    
   The Policy attribute provides differentiated services and this 
   attribute uses a resource class attribute. The Policy attribute can 
   have the following attributes. 
   -  Allowable hops of end to end 
 
 
D. G. Kim              Expires - December 2002              [Page 11]

                  draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-00.txt         June 2002 
 
 
   -  the number of resources offered 
   -  protection and restoration mechanism for network survivability 
   -  optical signal noise ratio (OSNR), bit error rate (BER) 
   -  network provisioning 
    
   For example, if the ranges of services according to resource grade 
   present Si, Tj, Uk, those ranges can be presented in the expressions 
   below:  
    
   S = { S1, S2, S3, ... Si} 
   T = { T1, T2, T3, ... Tj} 
   U = { U1, U2, U3, ... Uk} 
    
   Ranges of services and same grade of services offered are classified 
   according to the expressions listed above and differentiated services 
   can be provided according to the network policy and optical 
   characteristics. For example, through the limitation of end-to-end 
   hops network management can be done. Services included in Si allow a 
   maximum of 30 hops; Services in Tj allow a maximum of 20 hops so that 
   the limitation of hops can be operated as an element of network 
   management. The number of available wavelengths per link is applied 
   for network management. For example, the number of wavelengths per 
   link included in Si is 10; the number of wavelengths per link 
   included in Tj is 4. According to the range of services, the finite 
   number of wavelengths can be limited and applied to the network 
   management. This scheme that the service range depends on service 
   grade establishes the parameter for traffic engineering and is 
   capable of implementation. As the provisioning that depends on the 
   service range can construct to system, differentiated services can be 
   provided according to the resource grade attribute of the optical 
   network. 
    
    
6.3  Traffic Attribute 
    
   The Traffic Attribute is the element that captures the 
   characteristics of the traffic streams. In MPLS the bandwidth of LSP, 
   maximum throughput allowed, and minimum data rate guaranteed are 
   included in classification of attributes [4]. If this definition is 
   extended to the optical network, traffic attributes can be extended 
   to physical and logical values of wavelength, waveband, and fiber. 
   There are important traffic attributes as follows: 
   - the characteristics of fiber: fiber type(single mode, or multimode), 
   maximum transmission distance per fiber 
   - the number of wavelengths per fiber and existence of fiber or not 
   - the number of lambda channels included in a waveband 
   - the bandwidth of a lambda channel 
   - the maximum or minimum of data rate 
 
 
D. G. Kim              Expires - December 2002              [Page 12] 

                  draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-00.txt         June 2002 
 
 
   These traffic attributes include common elements of resource 
   attributes and utilize the characteristics of resources. 
    
    
6.4  Adaptivity Attribute 
    
   The states and resources of network change over time. These changes 
   result from the availability of new resources and reactivation of 
   failed resources, and de-allocation of allocated resources. In the 
   view of traffic engineering, an administrative function that can 
   control the resources is required because of this dynamism of network. 
   An adaptivity attribute is a part of the path maintenance parameters 
   and can be presented as re-optimization [8].  According to this 
   adaptivity attribute, the execution of an optimization algorithm 
   depends on the network state in considering stability. This 
   adaptivity attribute is the necessary attribute at the stage of 
   Network Topology Migration described in section 4.1.5. The adaptive 
   algorithm that has a minimum effect on the network state should 
   support this adaptivity attribute and can provide provisioning at the 
   time of implementation, and control the network state. 
    
    
6.5 Priority Attribute 
    
   Priority attribute gives priority to the emergency data and real time 
   data and should be considered with the above resource class attribute 
   and policy attribute. For the implementation of the priority 
   attribute optical resources with excellent quality characteristics- 
   for example resource that its end-to-end BER is lower is allocated or 
   backup path leased for restoration is allocated- are allocated to 
   high priority. And   routing and signaling protocol that are updated 
   to occupy optical characteristics can be considered to include the 
   function that can allocate and control the priority. Also for the 
   priority services the preemption that depends on priority should be 
   allowed. 
    
    
6.6  Preemption Attribute 
    
   The preemption attribute should be considered with the priority 
   attribute and resilience attribute and it is the function that can 
   give itself using resources to high priority data according to 
   network priority. This function is useful for the efficiency of 
   resources and costs and especially for the implementation of various 
   prioritized restoration policies. However low priority traffic should 
   be used for the optical link and path with preemption attribute, and 
   the provisioning function should be able to control the preemption 
   attribute.

6.7  Resilience attribute 
    
   The resilience attribute for network stability can be defined as a 
   function that when a fault of link or node occurs, a used traffic 
   stream is transferred to a new path through an alternate path and the 
   path generation algorithm. The type of recovery mechanism of the link 
   can be classified as below according to the time of capacity 
   allocation and the decision about backup capacity [11]. 
   
   1) Dedicated Protection is that capacity allocation and decision of 
   backup that is concluded before a fault occurs and for example, a 1+1 
   recovery scheme gives a dedicated protection path for a link or 
   wavelength. This schemeÆs advantages are that it is simple to 
   implement and has fast recovery, but its disadvantage is that it is 
   poorer in the utilization of resources. 
   
   2) Preplanned Restoration is that backup capacity that is decided 
   before a failure but allocation of backup capacity is decided after a 
   failure. For example, when high priority traffic and low priority 
   traffic are used together and high priority traffic has failed, low 
   priority traffic is removed. A 1:1 recovery scheme is a link of low 
   priority traffic that is given to high priority traffic. And 1:N 
   recovery scheme is the other example that recovery depends on 
   priority traffic and one backup path is established for the N link 
   through the control signal assuming that a failure in all links does 
   not occur simultaneously. This scheme is achieved by signaling so 
   that recovery time is slower than dedicated recovery and more complex 
   but is excellent in resource utilization 
   
   3) Dynamic Restoration is the backup capacity and decision that are 
   executed after failure and is most excellent but has the disadvantage 
   of having recovery time is low and the implementation is complex. In 
   the optical network fast recovery is required and therefore a fast 
   path generation algorithm is required for introducing Dynamic 
   Restoration into the optical network. 
   Also the Protection Link Group (PLG) of concept is required for 
   providing the differentiated services of protection according to the 
   priority of the link or data. The Protection Link Group provides 
   differentiated recovery time when the priority link and its backup 
   path are established by using the three recovery schemes above. This 
   PLG scheme can provide differentiated services in the view of 
   resource utilization and network policy because the N: 1 or N: M 
   protection group based on priority can be created. 
    
7. Implementation Considerations 
    
   If considering the common information for the construction of the 
   GMPLS network based on these attributes in IP and optical domain, 
   next the requirements of each layer should be considered [6]. 
    1)IP layer

                  draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-00.txt         June 2002 
 
 
      - information about virtual topology (set of light path connected 
        between routers) of IP network 
      - information about link state of IP network 
    2) WDM layer 
      - information about Physical Topology ( set of fiber connected 
        between WDM devices) 
      - information about the continuity of wavelength allocated to each 
        link, e.g. wavelength converter is equipped or not 
      - information about switching capability and port usage 
        (information of capability of fiber, waveband, and wavelength   
        switching for each port) 
      - information about fiber, the physical link, for example the 
        number of available wavelengths per fiber, directionality, 
        optical SNR of wavelength, BER 
      - information about the light path, for example, the identity (ID) 
        of the component at the destination network, port ID of adding 
        light path, port ID of dropping, directionality, Fiber ID, 
        throughput per wavelength, end-to-end SNR, Shared Risk Link Group 
        (SRLG) ID, Protection Link Group (PLG) ID etc. 
    
    
8. Conclusion 
    
   This manuscript presented a set of requirements for traffic 
   engineering over GMPLS and attributes that should be considered. 
   Especially a network state information database for traffic 
   engineering is a necessary requirement that should be considered when 
   extended to an optical network. Through the definition and 
   application scheme of attributes that consist of network state 
   information database, the model of traffic engineering can be 
   proposed for optimal utilization of resources when a real network is 
   presented. When GMPLS network is popular in the future, the scheme 
   that adds and controls information of optical characteristics to 
   present the IP control element will be an important scheme to improve 
   traffic engineering. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not introduce new security issues beyond those 
   inherent in GMPLS. It is, however, possible that using the suggested 
   network management attributes provisioning can be done as 
   administrative usage.
