Internet-Draft   Chrysolite - a backbone bridging solution    Mar 2008 
    

   Chrysolite is a combination of differing technologies to create a 
   wide area BB (Backbone Bridging) architecture. Each Chrysolite switch 
   has a unique MAC address (C-MAC). A link state protocol provides 
   pairwise shortest paths between the C-MACs (one C-MAC per switch). 
   Each switch's C-MAC symbolically represents 2^24 Network N-MACs (with 
   each N-MAC representing one of the endpoints of a P2P VLAN. Using MAT 
   (MAC Address Translation) and setting the locally administered bit in 
   the Ethernet address, Router MAC addresses attached to an edge 
   Chrysolite switch are translated into the end-to-end N-MAC addresses 
   of the P2P circuit that they are attached to. MAT can also be 
   completely avoided by use of a single packet UNI explained below. ALL 
   of the P2P location information for a packet is located in a SINGLE 
   N-MAC address assigned to each end of the P2P VLAN 'circuits'. Using 
   this UNI or MAT backup means that no encapsulation or special headers 
   are required to provide pair-wise shortest paths between the 
   Chrysolite switches. Configuration is restricted to the single unique 
   C-MAC required per Chrysolite switch, and the recording of unique 
   customer VLANs as they are required. VLANs with differing class of 
   service can be achieved by the use of multiple link state instances 
   and C-MACs on a single Chrysolite switch. 

1. Introduction 

   This draft uses MAC Address Translation (MAT) to provide VLAN 
   functionality natively to BB. Pair wise shortest paths are calculated 
   for each of the unique C-MACs (one per Chrysolite switch). 

   There are 2^20 possible C-MACs. The C-MACs summarize each of the 2^24 
   N-MACs. The N-MACs can be thought of as 'network MACs' rather like an 
   IP subnet. Each of the N-MACs can be considered as a unique endpoint 
   to a P2P VLAN. See addressing structure below. 

   All 'unknown packets' common to traditional bridged networks are 
   therefore removed, because the locally administered (/translated) N-
   MACs are easily identified as relating to their respective C-MACs and 
   are routed towards their relevant Chrysolite switches using the pair-
   wise shortest paths. As with standard switches the Chrysolite 
   switches do not have MAC addresses on each port. The number of pair-
   wise shortest paths and the size of the routing table cannot exceed 
   the number of C-MACs (switches) in the network. The FIB table is 
   restricted therefore to the number of Chrysolite switches in the 
   network, whilst routing 16 million individual P2P VLAN circuits. 
   Ospf-lite [LITE] will be used as the link state routing protocol to 
   calculate the pair-wise shortest paths.

2. Are the C-MACs in a Heirarchy?  

   It would be a mistake to think of the C-MACs as being located in a 
   hierarchy. They can be located anywhere in the cloud and moved at any 
   time. They are not fixed in any way. However each C-MAC is an 
   aggregate of many N-MACs (P2P VLANs). 

3. Will I be using MAT all the time? 

   (Note: If the UNI is used - i.e. the router forms the MAC addresses 
   with the N-MACs directly - then there is no MAT occurring either in 
   the Chrysolite switch or in the attached router.)  

   Without the UNI in operation then the following applies: for each N-
   MAC (VLAN) on a Chrysolite switch there is only one 'tunnel end 
   point' N-MAC that it sends packets to and there is only one source N-
   MAC allowed to transmit (tunnel source). So every packet needs to 
   have the MAC addresses swapped. The destination MAC address should 
   normally be correct (i.e. will not need swapping) due to normal 
   routing operations, but the source will need swapping. 

   However, these 'tunnels' require connection to routers via Ethernet 
   interfaces or 802.1Q trunks. As such the attached router can use the 
   correct addresses if informed by the Chrysolite switch via the simple 
   UNI.  

   When using the single packet UNI, there is no MAT translation either 
   on the router or on the Chrysolite switch. 

4. Chrysolite UNI 

   The Chrysolite switch will send a packet to the attached router 
   detailing the following: 

   o The VLAN in use, and the source and destination N-MAC addresses 
      that should be used when encapsulating these packets. 

   o Sequence number of information packet.

Internet-Draft   Chrysolite - a backbone bridging solution    Mar 2008 
    

   The destination MAC address of the Chrysolite UNI is [TBD]. The 
   protocol number of the packets is [TBD] Ref IANA. 

   ALL packets including broadcast or multicast that the router decides 
   to send over the P2P 'tunnel' MUST have their destination N-MAC set 
   to the end of the 'tunnel', and their 'source' N-MAC set to the N-MAC 
   assigned by the Chrysolite switch. 

5. MAT Mechanism 

   A standard Ethernet frame arrives at the first Chrysolite switch. 
   From the ingress port (or from the 802.Q header running on a trunk), 
   the VLAN of the packet source is identified. 

   Once the VLAN is identified, the packet undergoes MAT (MAC Address 
   Translation). This is instead of encapsulation. 

   There is MAT running at both ends of the Chrysolite cloud so 
   translation of the SA MAC address occurs on entry to the cloud. See 
   section 13 and figure 2 for a full example IP packet. 

6. Unusual multicast (layer 2) packets 

   Without the use of the UNI, the Chrysolite switch will have to MAT 
   the DA (Destination Address) of all unusual incoming packets to the 
   'tunnel' end point N-MAC. 

   If packets do not have the correct destination N-MAC, they MUST be 
   either MAT translated or discarded and not propagated further. 

   This applies to all MAC addresses, including packets in the following 
   OUI or first 3 octet ranges; 01-80-C2, 01-00-5E, 00-005E, and 33-33-
   FF. 

   Normal bridge control frames destined for the Chrysolite switch 
   itself from the router / end host are processed as normal but not 
   propagated over the network. 

7. Example Chrysolite addressing 

   If the host is on VLAN-1 with an N-component of 00-00-01, and the 
   ingress Chrysolite switch is numbered 02-00-08 (unique C component), 
   then the Chrysolite switch would have a C-MAC of 02-00-08-00-00-00, 
   and the router would have a source N-MAC of 02-00-08-00-00-01, where 
   02-00-08 is the C-MAC component, 00-00-01 is the P2P VLAN component 
   (the 0x02 is derived from having the Local bit set.)

7.1. Structure of the MAC addresses: 

1.        Most significant 4 bits (1-4) of first Byte (on the wire) of MAC:
           Part of unique C-MAC 

2.        Least significant 4 bits (5-8) of first Byte (on the wire) of MAC:  

   o Bit 5 = '*'reserved 

   o Bit 6 = 'R' Routing bit 

   o Bit 7 = Global/Local bit (set) 

   o Bit 8 = Group bit. 

3.        Next two bytes of MAC: The rest of the unique C-MAC component. 

4.        The last 24 bits in the address represent the N-MAC component (P2P 
   VLAN). These represent 2^24 unique 'tunnels' across the Chrysolite 
   cloud.

The location of the C-MACs addresses within the Chrysolite cloud is not 
critical. There is no hierarchy of structure. C-MACs MUST be unique 
within the cloud. The cloud must also be made of contiguous switches 
that understand the Global/Local bit in the Ethernet header, and not

contain directly connected hosts, unless via a Chrysolite switch capable 
of performing the required MAT translation. 

8. Packet types 

8.1. 'Unknown' Packets 

   This architecture does not have unknown packets. All MAC addresses 
   are known in the cloud, and are found via the 'C' portion of the N-
   MAC addresses in much the same way that an IP packet's destination 
   can be located within a cloud. 

8.2. Native MAC Multicast ingress Packets 

8.2.1. 'Reserved' multicast C and N components 

   Multicast packets with the first three octets = 01-80-C2, 01-00-5E, 
   00-00-5E, and 33-33-FF MUST be either MAT translated or discarded. 

9. Broadcast over Chrysolite 

   Although broadcast packets are not required for the functioning of 
   Chrysolite, they are available. A broadcast packet would go to each 
   of the C-MACs using the address FX-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF, where X;(0x3) 
   represents the 4 least significant bits of the first byte on wire. 
   The group bit is set and the local bit is always set for a broadcast 
   packet within a Chrysolite network: 

   o Bit 5 = '*'reserved 

   o Bit 6 = 'R' Routing bit NOT set for a broadcast packet 

   o Bit 7 = Global/Local bit MUST be set for all packets 

   o Bit 8 = Group bit. 

9.1.1. Reverse Path forwarding 

RPF checking is done on all broadcast packets. Packets failing this 
check are discarded. 

10. Routing Considerations 

   Ospf-lite will be used as the routing protocol to create pair-wise 
   shortest paths between the C-MACs of the Chrysolite switches.

10.1. MAC address for MAC level ospf-lite 

   MAC level communication of ospf-lite will be used. For normal (non 
   multi instance operation) ospf-lite will use the highest N-MAC 
   address of the 'broadcast' C-MAC; FX-FF-FF with the group bit, local 
   bit, and routing bit set. i.e. FX-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. Where X is set to 
   0x7 (Routing bit set, Group bit set, and Local bit set.) 

   There are in total 8 reserved multicast addresses for implementation 
   of multi-instance ospf-lite. These range from FX-FF-FF-FF-FF-F8 
   through to FX-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF, where the default operation is the use 
   of FX-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. See section 15 for multi instance information. 

   The routing bit is shown in Fig. 1. This informs the Chrysolite 
   switch that the packet is an ospf-lite routing packet. The source 
   address MUST be the C-MAC of the Chrysolite switch sending the ospf-
   lite packet. Ospf-lite routing protocol packets will only transition 
   one Chrysolite switch hop. 

   VLAN information about each Chrysolite switch is not required to be 
   attached to the router LSA and SHOULD NOT be attached. Router LSAs 
   SHOULD ONLY detail directly attached neighbor's C-MACs. The 
   Chrysolite switch forming the LSA will use its C-MACs as the router 
   ID. 

11. How to build a Chrysolite network 

   The Chrysolite network is a network of Ethernet switches implemented 
   over the WAN. Each switch is given a unique MAC address called a C-
   MAC. These C-MACs can be located at random in the non-hierarchical 
   flat network. 

   Because customers are attached to a Chrysolite switch at the edge, 
   the identity of the physical remote and local switches are decided 
   according to the circuit that the customer requires; i.e. if a 
   customer wants a connection from London to Manchester, then the 
   geographically closest switches they would like to connect between 
   are decided upon. 

   A unique VLAN number for the customer's P2P circuit is assigned 
   sequentially from the 2^24-bit range and dedicated to this 'circuit'/ 
   'VLAN' 'P2P VLAN' etc. (depending on the naming convention). 

   This VLAN number ACTUALLY builds the endpoint destination N-MAC 
   addresses that the customers will use to communicate. The 3-octet 
   VLAN number is added to the switch's unique first three octets of C-
   MAC, to build the full 6-octet N-MAC as discussed.

Internet-Draft   Chrysolite - a backbone bridging solution    Mar 2008 
    

   ALL Packets entering the Chrysolite cloud are sent from the source N-
   MAC (built as a combination of the switch's unique 3-octets of C-MAC 
   and the unique 3 octets of circuit N-MAC), across the cloud to the 
   destination N-MAC (which is also built with the destination C-MAC as 
   the first three octets and the same 3 octet circuit number). 

12. Why are there only 2 N-MACs per VLAN? 

   Although BB technologies regularly refer to 'customer VLANs', it is 
   unlikely that a customer would fully bridge their real VLAN wide 
   area. A modern LAN of 1 Gb/s would require a high wide area bandwidth 
   of a similar order of magnitude if fully bridged. ARP packets and 
   broadcasts and ALL unknowns would cross the Wide Area. Having the ARP 
   from two local PC's cross Wide Area is not the meaning of 'customer 
   VLAN'. As such when we refer to 'customer VLAN' we are assuming that 
   a router device has terminated the real customer VLANs with the 
   associated ARPs and is actually using specific 'customer VLANs' for 
   routing the relevant traffic over the WAN. 

   With this understanding Chrysolite allows an N-MAC at each end of the 
   tunnel, and provides router P2P VLAN connections. 

13. OAM  

   System management can take place if IP addresses are configured. An 
   OAM system can work in conjunction with SNMP to ascertain and 
   configure unique N-MACs. A MIB will be produced for Chrysolite 
   switches, with variables for P2P VLANs (N-MACs) assigned. 

14. An example of operation (How the MAT 'backup' works and why) 

   Consider Figure 2 below. 

   The routers attached at each end of the P2P Chrysolite cloud see 
   their network as it is, a MAC-to-MAC connection. The routers may have 
   IP addresses and these should be in the same network as per normal 
   router-to-router communication. 

   When not using UNI 

   If the routers are not using the UNI and are ignoring the UNI packets 
   being sent from the Chrysolite switch, then they may ARP for the 
   remote end's layer three address. Assuming IP, this will work as 
   follows: 

   R1 (1.1.1.1) ARPs for R2 (1.1.1.2). The ARP is sent into the ingress 
   Chrysolite switch (C1) which performs the required MAT to the known

   destination N-MAC address. It is known because the VLAN number (N 
   portion of the MAC) has been selected to be unique for this 'circuit' 
   and the circuit endpoint (the C-MAC portion) is the physical location 
   purchased by the customer.  

   When the packet arrives at the egress of the Chrysolite cloud (C2) 
   the packet is MAT translated to the ARP broadcast MAC address, with 
   the source left untranslated. Thus the end router R2, sees the N-MAC 
   of R1 as a source MAC and will use it to reply to R1. The same 
   conversion takes place on the ARP reply, with R2's source address 
   being MAT translate, resulting in each of the two routers R1 and R2 
   knowing the correct translated N-MAC of the other end. 

   Once this initial IP ARP takes place, the destination MAC addresses 
   should be the correct destination N-MAC. MAT is removed from the 
   destination N-MACs and only applies to the source N-MACs. 

   Until the ARP times-out, the routers know the destination N-MACs and 
   the Chrysolite ingress switches only have to MAT the source MAC to 
   the required N-MAC. 

   When using the UNI 

   When UNI is activated at the router ends then MAT is not required, as 
   the routers can form the packets correctly when building the MAC 
   frames with the correct N-MACs required to travel over the Chrysolite 
   cloud. ALL packets sent by the router over the P2P connection MUST be 
   constructed using these addresses including any multicast MACs, 
   special frames etc. If the router does not do this, then the 
   Chrysolite switch must either MAT translate the unusual packet 
   arriving at the ingress interface OR discard the packet and not 
   propagate it further into the Chrysolite network.

Internet-Draft   Chrysolite - a backbone bridging solution    Mar 2008 
    

15. Mapping differing classes of service to P2P VLANs 

   Class of service (or other required quality), can be mapped into 
   Chysolite P2P VLANs. These differing P2P VLAN classes can be 
   implemented in Chrysolite by using multiple parallel chrysolite 
   instances. Multiple C-MACs are configured per unique Chrysolite 
   switch and multiple instances of ospf-lite are also configured. The 
   multiple instances are configured on each switch with local 
   parameters, and can be referred to by local markers if required which 
   are not sent on the wire. 

   Each port of the switch is locally configured to belong to: 

   1. The local name for the ospf-lite instance. 

   2. The correct C-MAC for the source of the ospf-lite packets. 

   3. One of the 8 unique ospf-lite global multicast MAC addresses. 

   It is the selection of one of the globally unique ospf-lite MAC 
   addresses (for multi-instance ospf-lite) that enables the different 
   SPF trees to be built. 

                                                               
16. Security Considerations 

   The use of Chrysolite in a Backbone Bridging network presupposes 
   specialist switching equipment and dedicated circuits. Hosts cannot 
   connect directly to such a network without a Chrysolite switch. As 
   such this draft does not introduce security elements not already 
   present in Backbone bridging environments, and due to the backup MAT 
   or discard process, it may mitigate some issues. 

17. IANA Considerations 

   Chrysolite UNI will require an Ethernet code point [TBD], and a 
   reserved multicast MAC address. A MIB will also be required for the 
   Chrysolite switches. 

18. Conclusions 

   This architecture provides pair-wise shortest paths to backbone 
   bridges. This is accomplished via the use of MAT and Chrysolite UNI.
