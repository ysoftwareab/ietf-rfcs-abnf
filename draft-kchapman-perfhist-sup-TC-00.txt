2.  Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes tectual conventions used to
define 24 hour inteval counters which supplement the interval counters
defined in the 15 Minute Based Performance History TCs MIB <draft-ietf-
atommib-perfhistTC-01.txt> [1].  See for example the DS1/E1, DS2/E2,

INTERNET-DRAFT    Supplemental Performance History TC          July 1998


DS3/E3 and SONET/SDH supplemental MIBs [2][3][4]. This MIB is designed
to provide support for ASNI T1.231-1997 [6] 1-day registers.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.


3.  Overview

This document supplements <draft-ietf-atommib-perfhistTC-01.txt>.  In
particular, it provides support for MIB objects that support the
previous 1-day register and recent 1-day registers as defined in ASNI
T1.231-1997, clause 9.1.2.1.

-- *********************************************************************

-- Use of the Textual Conventions defined in this MIB module assumes the
-- following:
--
-- *  The agent supports 1-day based history counters.
-- *  The agent is capable of keeping a history of n intervals of 1-day
--    performance data.  The value of n may be limited by the media-
--    specific MIB module but shall be 1 < n =< 32, where n = 1
--    represents the current 1-day interval, n = 2 represents the
--    previous 1-day interval, n = 3 represents the newest recent 1-day
--    interval and n = 32 represents the oldest recent 1-day interval.
-- *  The agent will keep the following objects per interface:
--
-- xyzDayTimeElapsed OBJECT-TYPE
--     SYNTAX      INTEGER (0..86409)
--     MAX-ACCESS  read-only
--     STATUS      current
--     DESCRIPTION
--        "The number of seconds that have elapsed since the beginning
--         of the current 1-day perfromance history interval."
--     ::= { xxx }
--
-- xyzValidDays OBJECT-TYPE
--     SYNTAX      INTEGER (0..<n>)
--     MAX-ACCESS  read-only
--     STATUS      current
--     DESCRIPTION
--        "The oldest interval number for which data is available.  The
--         value will normally be n, where n is the number of 1-day
--         intervals supported by the agent.  However, some intervals
--         will not be available if the interface was brought online
--         within the last n days, in which case the value will be the
--         number of 1-day intervals since the interface has been online
--         (including the current interval).  It is also possible that
--         some intervals are unavailable in the case where the agent is
--         a proxy."

HourOfDay ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1d1a1d:1d"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
       "A time-of-day specification at an hour boundary.  This is used
        to specify an event that is to occure at precisely the same time
        each day, on the hour; for example, the time to save an
        interface's current 1-day counter as the previous 1-day counter
        and reset the current 1-day counter to zero.

             -----  --------                  -----

        For example, 1 PM EDT would be displayed as:

             13-4:0

        Note that if only local time is known, then timezone information
        (octes 2-4) is not present."
    SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE (1 | 4))

PerfDayCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
       "A counter associated with interface performance measurements in
        a 1-day (24 hour) measurement interval.  This data type can be
        used for either a current interval or a pervious or recent 1-day
        interval.

        For a current interval, the value of this counter starts at zero
        and is increased when associated events occur, until the end of
        the 1-day interval.  At that time the value of the counter is
        stored in the first 1-day history interval (if supported), and
        the current interval counter is restarted at zero.  Unlike a
        counter32, this counter shall not wrap; it shall latch if it
        reachs its maximum value (4294967295 decimal) and it shall not
        change until it is reset (e.g. at the beginning of a new
        interval).

        In a system supporting a history of n intervals, where
        DayCount(1) and DayCount(n) contain the most and least recent
        historic intervals respectively, the following applies at the
        end of a 24 hour interval:

        - discard the value of DayCount(n)
        - the value of DayCount(i) becomes that of
          DayCount(i-1) for n >= i > 1
        - the value of DayCount(1) becomes the value of the current
          interval count
        - the current interval count is restarted at zero.

        In the case where the agent has no data available for a
        particular interval the corresponding object instance is not
        available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error
        message (noSuch*) shall be returned."
