1.  Introduction

   This note describes the expected behavior of an IPv6 [RFC2460] host
   in a network that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an
   upstream network that implements BCP 38 [RFC2827] filtering.  It
   expects that the network will implement some form of egress routing,
   so that packets sent to a host outside the local network from a given
   ISP's prefix will go to that ISP.  If the packet is sent to the wrong
   egress, it is liable to be discarded by the BCP 38 filter.  However,
   the mechanics of egress routing once the packet leaves the host are
   out of scope.  The question here is how the host interacts with that
   network.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Expectations the host has of the network

   A host receives on-link prefixes in a Router Advertisement [RFC4861],
   which goes on to identify preference order among them and whether
   they are usable by SLAAC [RFC4862] [RFC4941] [RFC7217], or whether
   they must be assigned using DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   The simplest multihomed network implementation might be a LAN with
   one or more hosts on it and two or more routers, one for each
   upstream network.  In such a network, there is no routing protocol,
   and the two routers may not even know that the other is a router as
   opposed to a host, apart from the fact that it is emitting Router

   Advertisements (RAs).  One might expect that the routers may or may
   not receive each other's RAs and form an address in the other
   router's prefix.  However, all hosts in such a network might be
   expected to create an address in each prefix so advertised.

   Because there is no routing protocol among those routers, there is no
   mechanism by which packets can be deterministically forwarded between
   the routers (as described in BCP 84 [RFC3704]) in order to avoid BCP
   38 filters.  Even if there was, it would be an indirect route, rather
   than a direct route originating with the host.  Therefore the host
   needs to select the appropriate router itself.

   Since the host derives fundamental default routing information from
   the RA, this implies that, on any network with multiple prefixes,
   each prefix SHOULD be advertised by one of the attached routers, even
   if addresses are being assigned using DHCPv6.

3.  Reasonable expectations of the host

   Modern hosts maintain a fair bit of history, in terms of what has
   historically worked or not worked for a given address or prefix and
   in some cases the effective window and MSS values for TCP.  This
   includes a next hop address for use when a packet is sent to the
   indicated address.

   A host SHOULD include the prefix it used in a successful exchange
   with a remote address or prefix in such history.  On subsequent
   attempts to communicate with that remote address, if it has such an
   address at that time, a host MAY use its address in the remembered
   prefix for the exchange.

   A host SHOULD select a "default gateway" for each prefix it uses to
   obtain one of its own addresses.  That router SHOULD be one of the
   routers advertising the prefix in its RA.  As a result of doing so,
   when a host emits a datagram using a source address in one of those
   prefixes and has no history directing it otherwise, it SHOULD send it
   to the indicated "default gateway".  In the "simplest" network
   described in Section 2, that would get it to the only router that is
   capable of getting it to the right ISP.  This will also apply in more
   complex networks, even when more than one physical or virtual
   interface is involved.

   There is an interaction with Default Address Selection [RFC6724].
   Rule 5.5 of that specification states that the source address used to
   send to a given destination address should if possible be chosen from
   a prefix known to be advertised by the next-hop router for that
   destination.  This selection rule would be applicable in a host
   following the recommendation in the previous paragraph.

4.  Expectations of multihomed networks

   The direct implication of Section 2 is that routing protocols used in
   multihomed networks SHOULD be capable of source-prefix based egress
   routing, and that multihomed networks SHOULD deploy them.

5.  Residual issues

   The assumption that packets will be forwarded to the appropriate
   egress by the local routing system might cause at least one extra hop
   in the local network (from the host to the wrong router, and from
   there to another router on the same LAN but in a different subnet).
   In some scenarios, where the local network is a highly constrained or
   lossy wireless network, this extra hop may be a significant
   performance handicap.

   In a slightly more complex situation, which happens to be one of the
   authors' home plus corporate home-office configuration, the two
   upstream routers might be on different LANs and therefore different
   subnets (e.g., the host is itself multi-homed).  In that case, there
   is no way for the "wrong" router to detect the existence of the
   "right" router, or to route to it.

   In such a case it is particularly important that hosts take the
   responsibility to memorize and select the best first-hop as described
   in Section 3.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create any new security or privacy exposures.
