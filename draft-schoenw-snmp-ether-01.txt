1.  Introduction

   This document specifies how Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   messages can be transmitted directly over IEEE 802 networks.  For a
   detailed overview of the documents that describe the SNMP management
   framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  This
   document complements the standard SNMP transport mappings defined in
   RFC 3417 [RFC3417].

   This document obsoletes RFC 1089.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  SNMP over IEEE 802 Networks

   This is an optional transport mapping.

   SNMP over IEEE 802 networks has some inherent restrictions.  Using
   the SNMP over IEEE 802 transport mapping restricts messages to a
   single logical IEEE 802 LAN, bridged LAN or VLAN.  Furthermore, only
   a single SNMP engine can be addressed on a given IEEE 802 network
   interface.  In particular, command generators and notification
   receivers as well as command responders and notification originators
   must share a single transport endpoint.

3.1.  Serialization

   SNMP messages are serialized as described in Section 8 of RFC 3417
   [RFC3417].  The resulting serialized message is shipped in the data
   portion of an IEEE LAN MAC frame.

3.2.  Well-known Values

   Serialized SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3 frames with an
   Ethernet type field of 33100 (hexadecimal 814C).

   When serialized SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3 frames (and in
   other IEEE 802 MAC frame types that can natively represent Ethernet
   type values), an Ethernet type field value of 33100 (hexadecimal
   814C) is used as the link layer protocol identifier.  In IEEE 802
   LANs that use LLC as the means of link layer protocol identification,
   such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs, the SNAP encapsulation method
   described in subclause 10.5 "Encapsulation of Ethernet frames over
   LLC" in [IEEE802] is used.

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it MUST be capable
   of accepting SNMP messages up to and including 484 octets in size.
   It is recommended that implementations be capable of accepting
   messages of up to 1472 octets in size.  Implementation of larger
   values is encouraged whenever possible.

               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               (Each tic mark represents one bit.)


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has to make a MIB OID assignment under the snmpModules branch
   for the SNMP-IEEE802-TM-MIB module.

   IANA has to assign an OID value below snmpDomains for the transport
   domain.


5.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines an OBJECT-IDENTIFIER which may be used by other MIB modules
   to identify a SNMP transport mapping.  Meaningful security
   considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define
   management objects.  The MIB module in this document has therefore no
   impact on the security of the Internet.

   SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c messages are not considered secure.  It is
   recommended that the implementors consider the use of SNMPv3 messages
   and the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.

Internet-Draft             SNMP over IEEE 802                  July 2006


   Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC
   3414 [RFC3414] and the View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC
   3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to a MIB is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change) them.


6.  Acknowledgments

   The original SNMP over Ethernet definition was written by Marty
   Schoffstall, Chuck Davin, Mark Fedor, and Jeff Case and published as
   RFC 1089 [RFC1089].  Bert Wijnen and Dan Romascanu provided guidance
   on many aspects of this specification.
