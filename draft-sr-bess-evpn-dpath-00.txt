   Domain Path (D-PATH) for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Interconnect Networks
                      draft-sr-bess-evpn-dpath-00

Abstract

   The BGP Domain PATH (D-PATH) attribute is defined for Inter-Subnet
   Forwarding (ISF) BGP Sub-Address Families that advertise IP prefixes.
   When used along with EVPN IP Prefix routes or IP-VPN routes, it
   identifies the domain(s) through which the routes have passed and
   that information can be used by the receiver BGP speakers to detect
   routing loops or influence the BGP best path selection.  This
   document extends the use of D-PATH so that it can also be used along
   with EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes in EVPN Broadcast Domains (BD)
   and Auto-Discovery per EVPN Instance routes in Virtual Private Wire
   Services (VPWS).

1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   The BGP Domain PATH (D-PATH) attribute
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ipvpn-interworking] is defined for Inter-Subnet
   Forwarding (ISF) BGP Sub-Address Families that advertise IP prefixes.
   When used along with EVPN IP Prefix routes or IP-VPN routes, it
   identifies the domain(s) through which the routes have passed and
   that information can be used by the receiver BGP speakers to detect
   routing loops or influence the BGP best path selection.  This
   document extends the use of D-PATH so that it can also be used along
   with EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes in EVPN Broadcast Domains (BD)
   [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis] and Auto-Discovery per EVPN Instance
   routes in Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWS) [RFC8214].

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This section summarizes the terminology that is used throughout the
   rest of the document.

   o  MAC-VRF: a MAC Virtual Routing and Forwarding table, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].  It is also the instantiation of an
      EVI (EVPN Instance) in a PE.

   o  BD and BT: a Broadcast Domain and Bridge Table, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].  A BD is a group of PEs attached to
      the same EVPN layer-2 multipoint service.  A BT is the
      instantiation of a Broadcast Domain in a PE.  When there is a
      single Broadcast Domain in a given EVI, the MAC-VRF in each PE
      will contain a single BT.  When there are multiple BTs within the
      same MAC-VRF, each BT is associated to a different Ethernet Tag.
      The EVPN routes specific to a BT, will indicate which Ethernet Tag
      the route corresponds to.

   o  AC: Attachment Circuit or logical interface associated to a given
      BT.  To determine the AC on which a packet arrived, the PE will
      examine the combination of a physical port and VLAN tags (where
      the VLAN tags can be individual c-tags, s-tags or ranges of both).

   o  RT-2: Route Type 2 or MAC/IP Advertisement route, as per
      [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].

   o  RT-1: Route Type 1 or Ethernet Auto-Discovery route, as per
      [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].

   o  ES and ESI: Ethernet Segment and Ethernet Segment Identifier, as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].

   o  TS: Tenant System.

   o  EVPN Layer2-Domain: two PEs are in the same Layer2-Domain if they
      are attached to the same tenant and the packets between them do
      not require a data path MAC lookup (in the BT of a MAC-VRF) in any
      intermediate router.  A Layer2-Domain Gateway PE is always
      configured with multiple Layer2-Domain identifiers (Layer2-Domain-
      ID) in the MAC-VRF that connects those Layer2-Domains, each
      Layer2-Domain-ID representing a Layer2-Domain.

      Example: Figure 1 illustrates an example where PE1 and PE2 belong
      to different Layer2-Domains since packets between them (for flows

      between TS1 and TS2) require a MAC lookup in two of the gateways
      that are connecting the three EVPN Layer2-Domains.  E.g., if
      frames from TS1 to TS2 go through PE1, GW1, GW3 and PE2, a MAC
      lookup is performed at GW1 and GW3.

           <---------------> <------------> <---------------->

                     Figure 1: EVPN Sub-Domain example

   o  Layer2-Domain Gateway PE: a PE that is attached to two or more
      EVPN Layer2-Domains.  An example of Layer2-Domain Gateway PE is a
      PE following the procedures in section 4.4 or section 4.6 of
      [RFC9014].  In the example in Figure 1, GW1 and GW2 connect
      Layer2-Domains 1 and 2, whereas GW3 and GW4 connect Layer2-Domains
      2 and 3.  GW1 and GW2 import the MAC/IP Advertisement route for
      TS1 coming from the Layer2-Domain 1 into the MAC-VRF for BD1, and
      re-advertise it into Layer2-Domain 2.  Likewise, GW3 and GW4
      import the route into their MAC-VRF and re-advertise it into
      Layer2-Domain 3.

4.  Use of Domain Path Attribute (D-PATH) with EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement
    routes

   This document extends the use of the D-PATH attribute specified in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ipvpn-interworking] so that D-PATH can be
   advertised and processed along with the following EVPN route types:

   o  EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes that are not used for Inter-
      Subnet Forwarding (ISF) [RFC9135].  Note: if the EVPN MAC/IP
      Advertisement route is used for Inter-Subnet Forwarding, the
      procedures for the D-PATH advertisement and processing are
      described in [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ipvpn-interworking].

   o  EVPN A-D per EVI routes that are used for EVPN-VPWS [RFC8214].
      The use of D-PATH in A-D per EVI routes not used for EVPN-VPWS is
      out of scope of this document.

Internet-Draft           D-PATH for Layer2 EVPN             October 2021


   The use of D-PATH along with other EVPN route types will be described
   in future versions of this document.

   When used along with non-ISF MAC/IP Advertisement routes or A-D per
   EVI routes, the D-PATH attribute is characterized as follows:

   1.  D-PATH is composed of a sequence of Domain segments following the
       format specified in [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ipvpn-interworking] where
       each Domain is represented as <DOMAIN-ID:ISF_SAFI_TYPE>.  In this
       specification, DOMAIN-ID is a Layer2-Domain identifier configured
       in a MAC-VRF and ISF_SAFI_TYPE is set to either 70 (EVPN) or 0
       (local route).  To simplify the explanation, this document
       represents the domains for EVPN RT-1s and RT-2s as <Layer2-
       Domain-ID:TYPE>.

   2.  D-PATH identifies the sequence of Layer2-Domains the route has
       gone through, with the last <Layer2-Domain-ID:TYPE> entry
       (rightmost) identifying the first PE that added the D-PATH
       attribute.

   3.  D-PATH SHOULD be added/modified by a Layer2-Domain Gateway PE
       that re-advertises the route and MAY be added by a PE that
       originates the route, as follows:

       A.  A Layer2-Domain Gateway PE that connects two Layer2-Domains
           "X" and "Y", and receives a route on a Layer2-Domain
           identified by a Layer2-Domain-ID "X" SHOULD append a domain
           <X:EVPN> to the existing (or newly added) D-PATH attribute
           when re-advertising the route to Layer2-Domain "Y".  The
           route is re-advertised if it is first imported in a MAC-VRF
           (or VPWS instance), the MAC (or Ethernet Tag) is active, and
           policy allows the re-export of the route to a BGP neighbor.

       B.  A Layer2-Domain Gateway PE MAY also add the D-PATH attribute
           for locally learned MACs or MAC/IP pairs.  In this case, the
           domain added would be <A:0>, where A is the Layer2-Domain-ID
           configured on the Gateway PE's MAC-VRF that is specific to
           local routes (MAC/IP learned via local AC), and "0" is the
           TYPE of the Layer2-Domain and indicates that the route is
           locally originated and not re-advertised after receiving it
           from a BGP-EVPN neighbor.  The Layer2-Domain-ID for local
           routes MAY be shared by all the redundant Layer2-Domain
           Gateway PEs for local routes, or each Layer2-Domain Gateway
           PE of the redundancy group can use its own Layer2-Domain-ID.

       C.  A PE that is connected to a single Layer2-Domain (therefore
           the PE is not a Layer2-Domain Gateway) MAY add the D-PATH
           with a domain <B:0>, where B is the Layer2-Domain-ID

Internet-Draft           D-PATH for Layer2 EVPN             October 2021


           configured on the PE's MAC-VRF (or VPWS) for locally learned
           MAC/IPs (or Ethernet Tag IDs for VPWS). "0" is the TYPE that
           indicates the route is not re-advertised, but originated in
           the PE.

   4.  On received EVPN routes, D-PATH is processed and used for loop
       detection (Section 4.1) as well as to influence the best path
       selection (Section 4.2 and Section 4.3).

4.1.  Loop Detection

   An EVPN route received by a PE with a D-PATH attribute that contains
   one or more of its locally associated Layer2-Domain-IDs for the MAC-
   VRF or VPWS instance is considered to be a looped route.  A looped
   route MUST NOT be installed, but kept in the BGP RIB, flagged as
   "looped".

   For instance, in the example of Figure 1, assuming PE1 advertises
   TS1's MAC/IP and does not add the D-PATH attribute, the Layer2-Domain
   Gateway GW1 receives two MAC/IP Advertisement routes for TS1's MAC/
   IP:

   o  A RT-2 with next-hop PE1 and no D-PATH.

   o  A RT-2 with next-hop GW2 and D-PATH={length=1,<6500:1:EVPN>},
      assuming that the Layer2-Domain-ID for Layer2-Domain 1 is 6500:1.

   In this case, Layer2-Domain Gateway GW1 flags the RT-2 with D-PATH as
   "looped", and does not install the MAC in the BT of the MAC-VRF,
   since the route includes one of GW1's Layer2-Domain-IDs.

4.2.  D-PATH and Best Path Selection for MAC/IP Advertisement routes

   When two (or more) MAC/IP Advertisement routes with the same route
   key (and same or different RDs) are received, a best path selection
   algorithm is used.  This section summarizes the best path selection
   for MAC/IP Advertisement routes, which extends the rules in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis] by including D-PATH in the tie-breaking
   algorithm.  While the algorithm may be implemented in different ways,
   the selection result SHOULD be the same as the result of the rules
   that follow.

   The tie-breaking algorithm begins by considering all EVPN MAC/IP
   Advertisement routes equally preferable routes to the same
   destination, and then selects routes to be removed from
   consideration.  The process terminates as soon as only one route
   remains in consideration.

Internet-Draft           D-PATH for Layer2 EVPN             October 2021


   1.  When the Default Gateway extended community is present in some of
       the routes, the MAC/IP Advertisement routes without the Default
       Gateway indication are removed from consideration, as defined in
       [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].

   2.  Then the routes with the Static bit set in the MAC Mobility
       extended community are preferred, and the routes without the
       Static bit set are removed from consideration, as defined in
       [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].  Note that this rule does not apply
       to routes with the Default Gateway extended community, since
       these routes SHALL NOT convey the MAC Mobility extended community
       [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].

   3.  Then the routes with the highest MAC Mobility Sequence number are
       preferred, hence the routes that are not tied for having the
       highest Sequence number are removed from consideration, as
       defined in [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis].

   4.  Then routes with the highest Local Preference are preferred,
       hence routes that are not tied for having the highest Local
       Preference are removed from consideration, as defined in
       [RFC4271].

   5.  Then routes with the shortest D-PATH are preferred, hence routes
       not tied for the shortest D-PATH are removed.  Routes without
       D-PATH are considered zero-length D-PATH.

   6.  Then routes with the numerically lowest left-most Sub-Domain-ID
       are preferred, hence routes not tied for the numerically lowest
       left-most Sub-Domain-ID are removed from consideration.

   7.  If the steps above do not produce a single route, the rest of the
       rules after the highest Local Preference in [RFC4271] apply after
       step 6.

   The above selection criteria is followed irrespective of the ESI
   value in the routes.  EVPN Multi-Homing procedures for Aliasing or
   Backup paths in [I-D.ietf-bess-rfc7432bis] are applied to the
   selected MAC/IP Advertisement route.

4.3.  D-PATH and Best Path Selection for Ethernet A-D per EVI routes

   When two (or more) EVPN A-D per EVI routes with the same route key
   (and same or different RDs) are received for a VPWS, a best path
   selection algorithm is used.  The selection algorithm follows the
   same steps as in Section 4.2 except for steps 1-3 which do not apply
   since the Default Gateway and MAC Mobility extended community are
   irrelevant to the EVPN A-D per EVI routes.

Internet-Draft           D-PATH for Layer2 EVPN             October 2021


   The above selection is followed for A-D per EVI routes with ESI=0.
   For non-zero ESI routes, the EVPN Multi-Homing procedures in
   [RFC8214] for Aliasing and Backup path are followed to select the
   routes (P and B flags are considered for the selection of the routes
   when sending traffic to a remote Ethernet Segment).  If the mentioned
   Multi-Homing procedures do not produce a single route to each of the
   remote PEs attached to the same ES, steps 4-7 in Section 4.2 are
   followed.

4.4.  Error Handling

   The error handling for the D-PATH attribute is described in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ipvpn-interworking].  This document extends the
   use of D-PATH to non-ISF EVPN routes.

5.  Use-Case Examples

   This section illustrates the use of D-PATH in EVPN routes with
   examples.

   Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate an integrated interconnect solution
   for an EVPN BD, as described in section 4.4 and section 4.6 of
   [RFC9014].  GW1 and GW2 are Layer2-Domain Gateway PEs connecting two
   L2-Domains identified by D-PATH domain {1:1:EVPN} and {1:2:EVPN},
   respectively.  Received Ethernet A-D routes, ES routes, and Inclusive
   Multicast routes from the routers in one Layer2-Domain are consumed
   and processed by GW1 and GW2, but not re-advertised to the other
   Layer2-Domain.  However, MAC/IP Advertisement routes received by GW1
   and GW2 in one Layer2-Domain are processed and, if installed, re-
   advertised into the other Layer2-Domain.

   Consider the example of Figure 2, where PE1 advertises a MAC/IP
   Advertisement route for M1/IP1.  The route is processed and installed
   by GW1 and GW2 in BD1, and both will re-advertise the routes into the
   Layer2-Domain-2.  By using D-PATH in GW1 and GW2, when the route is
   received on PE2, PE2 has the visibility of the Layer2-Domains through
   which the route has gone, and can also use the D-PATH for best path
   selection in case PE2 receives a MAC/IP Advertisement route for M1/
   IP1 by some other means.  In addition, GW1 and GW2 can compare the
   D-PATH of the incoming routes with their local list of Layer2-Domain-
   IDs, and detect a loop if any of the local Layer2-Domain-IDs matches
   a domain in the received D-PATH.  This procedure prevents the re-
   advertisement of the route back into Layer2-Domain-1.

   The example of Figure 3 illustrates how GW1 and GW2 can also have
   local ACs in BD1 and learn local MAC (or MAC/IP) addresses from
   devices connected to the ACs.  Assuming GW2 learns M3/IP3 via local
   AC, GW2 advertises a MAC/IP Advertisement route for M3/IP3 into each
   of the Layer2-Domains that GW2 is connected to.  As described in
   Section 4, GW2 can advertise these two MAC/IP Advertisement routes
   with a configured Layer2-Domain-ID for local MAC/IPs routes that can
   be shared with GW1.  Consider this Layer2-Domain-ID is 1:3 and it is
   configured on both, GW1 and GW2.  When GW2 advertises the route into
   each Layer2-Domain, it adds the D-PATH attribute with a domain
   {1:3:0}. These routes will be flagged by GW1 as "looped" since 1:3 is
   configured as a local Layer2-Domain-ID in GW1.  In addition, PE1 and
   PE2 will receive the routes with the D-PATH and they will have the
   visibility of the origin of the routes, in this case local
   Layer2-Domain Gateway routes.  This information can be used to
   influence the best path selection in case of multiple routes for M3/
   IP3 are received on PE1 or PE2 for BD1.

   As an alternative solution to configuring the same Layer2-Domain-ID
   for local routes on both Layer2-Domain Gateways, GW2 can be
   configured with Layer2-Domain-ID 1:3 for local routes, and GW1 can
   use a different Layer2-Domain-ID, e.g., 1:4.  In this case, GW2
   advertises the route for M3/IP3 into each Layer2-Domain as before,
   but now GW1 will not flag the route as "looped" since 1:3 is not on
   the list of GW1's local Layer2-Domain-IDs.  GW1 receives the routes
   from both Layer2-Domains, and GW1 selects the route from e.g.,
   Layer2-Domain-1.  GW1 then installs the route in its BT and re-
   advertises the route into Layer2-Domain-2 with D-PATH {1:1:EVPN,
   1:3:0}. When PE2 receives two routes for M3/IP3, one from GW2 with
   D-PATH {1:3:0} and another from GW1 with D-PATH {1:1:EVPN, 1:3:0},
   PE2 will use best path selection and choose to send its traffic to
   GW2.  Also GW2 will receive the route for M3/IP3 from GW1 and mark it
   as "looped" since that route conveys its own Layer2-Domain-IDs 1:1
   and 1:3.

   In a nutshell, the use of D-PATH in MAC/IP Advertisement routes helps
   prevent loops and influences the best path selection so that PEs
   choose the shortest paths to the destination PEs.
