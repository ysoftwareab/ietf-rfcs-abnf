INTERNET DRAFT         BGP Signaled FAT PW Labels          March 2, 2018


1  Introduction

   The mechanism described in [RFC6391] uses an additional label (Flow
   Label) in the MPLS label stack to allow Label Switch Routers to
   balance flows within Pseudowires at a finer granularity than the
   individual Pseudowires across the Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs)
   that exists within the Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   Furthermore, [RFC6391] defines the LDP protocol extensions required
   to synchronize the flow label states between the ingress and egress
   PEs when using the signaling procedures defined in the [RFC8077].

   A pseudowire (PW) [RFC3985] is transported over one single network
   path, even if Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs) exist between the
   ingress and egress PW provider edge (PE) equipment. This is required
   to preserve the characteristics of the emulated service.

   This draft introduces an optional mode of operation allowing to
   transport a PW over ECMPs, for example when the use of these is known
   to be beneficial to the operation of the PW.  This specification uses
   the principles defined in [RFC6391], and augments the BGP-signaling
   procedures of [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].  The use of a single path to
   preserve the packet delivery order remains the default mode of
   operation of a PW, and is described in [RFC4385] and [RFC4928].

   High bandwidth Ethernet-based services are a prime example that
   benefits from the ability to load-balance flows in a PW over multiple
   PSN paths. In general, load-balancing is applicable when the PW
   attachment circuit bandwidth and PSN core link bandwidth are of same
   order of magnitude.

   To achieve the load-balancing goal, [RFC6391] introduces the notion
   of an additional Label Stack Entry (LSE) (Flow label) located at the
   bottom of the stack (right after PW LSE).  Label Switching Routers
   (LSRs) commonly generate a hash of the label stack in order to
   discriminate and distribute flows over available ECMPs.  The presence
   of the Flow label (closely associated to a flow determined by the
   ingress PE) will normally provide the greatest entropy.

   Furthermore, following the procedures for Inter-AS scenarios
   described in [RFC4761] section 3.4, the Flow label should never be
   handled by the ASBRs, only the terminating PEs on each AS will be
   responsible for popping or pushing this label.  This is equally
   applicable to Method B [RFC4761] section 3.4.2 where ASBRs are
   responsible for swapping the PW label as traffic traverses from ASBR
   to PE and ASBR to ASBR directions.  Therefore, the Flow label will
   remain untouched across AS boundaries.

2. Modifications to Layer2 Info Extended Community

   The Layer2 Info Extended Community is used to signal control
   information about the pseudowires to be setup. The extended community
   format is described in [RFC4761]. The format of this extended
   community is described as:




            +------------------------------------+
            | Extended community type (2 octets) |
            +------------------------------------+
            |  Encaps Type (1 octet)             |
            +------------------------------------+
            |  Control Flags (1 octet)           |
            +------------------------------------+
            |  Layer-2 MTU (2 octet)             |
            +------------------------------------+
            |  Reserved (2 octets)               |
            +------------------------------------+

            Figure 1: Layer2 Info Extended Community


   Control Flags:

   This field contains bit flags relating to the control information
   about pseudowires. This field is augmented with a definition of 2 new
   flags field.


             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |Z|Z|Z|Z|T|R|C|S|      (Z = MUST Be Zero)
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 2: Control Flags Bit Vector


   With reference to the Control Flags Bit Vector, the following bits in
   the Control Flags are defined; the remaining bits, designated Z, MUST
   be set to zero when sending and MUST be ignored when receiving this
   Extended Community.

         T   When the bit value is 1, the PE announce the ability
             to send a Pseudowire packet that includes a flow label.
             When the bit value is 0, the PE is indicating that it will

             not send a Pseudowire packet containing a flow label.

         R   When the bit value is 1, the PE is able to receive a 
             Pseudowire packet with a flow label present. When the bit
             value is 0, the PE is unable to receive a Pseudowire packet
             with the flow label present.

         C   Defined in [RFC4761].

         S   Defined in [RFC4761].


3.  Signaling the Presence of the Flow Label

   As part of the Pseudowire signaling procedures described in
   [RFC4761], a Layer2 Info Extended Community is advertised in the VPLS
   BGP NLRI. 

   A PE that wishes to send a flow label in a Pseudowire packet MUST
   include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer2 Info Extended Community using
   Control Flags field with T = 1.

   A PE that is willing to receive a flow label in a Pseudowire packet
   MUST include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer2 Info Extended Community
   using Control Flags field with R = 1.

   A PE that receives a VPLS BGP NLRI containing a Layer2 Info Extended
   Community with R = 0 MUST NOT include a flow label in the Pseudowire
   packet.

   Therefore, a PE sending a Control Flags field with T = 1 and
   receiving a Control Flags field with R = 1 MUST include a flow label
   in the Pseudowire packet.  Under all other combinations, a PE MUST
   NOT include a flow label in the Pseudowire packet.

   A PE MAY support the configuration of the flow label (T and R bits)
   on a per-service (e.g., VPLS VFI) basis.  Furthermore, it is also
   possible that on a given service, PEs may not share the same flow
   label settings. The presence of a flow label is therefore determined
   on a per-peer basis and according to the local and remote T and R bit
   values.  For example, a PE part of a VPLS and with a local T = 1,
   must only transmit traffic with a flow label to those peers that
   signaled R = 1.  And if the same PE has local R = 1, it must only
   expect to receive traffic with a flow label from peers with T = 1.
   Any other traffic must not have a flow label. A PE expecting to
   receive traffic from a remote peer with a flow label MAY drop traffic
   that has no flow label. A PE expecting to receive traffic from a
   remote peer with no flow label MAY drop traffic that has flow label.

INTERNET DRAFT         BGP Signaled FAT PW Labels          March 2, 2018


   Modification of flow label settings may impact traffic over a PW as
   these could trigger changes in the PEs data-plane programming (i.e.
   imposition / disposition of flow label).  This is an implementation
   specific behavior and outside the scope of this draft.

   The signaling procedures in [RFC4761] state that the unspecified bits
   in the Control Flags field (bits 0-5) MUST be set to zero when
   sending and MUST be ignored when receiving.  The signaling procedure
   described here is therefore backwards compatible with existing
   implementations.  A PE not supporting the extensions described in
   this draft will always advertise a value of ZERO in the position
   assigned by this draft to the R bit and therefore a flow label will
   never be included in a packet sent to it by one of its peers.
   Similarly, it will always advertise a value of ZERO in the position
   assigned by this draft to the T bit and therefore a peer will know
   that a flow label will never be included in a packet sent by it.

   Note that what is signaled is the desire to include the flow LSE in
   the label stack.  The value of the flow label is a local matter for
   the ingress PE, and the label value itself is not signaled.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Although [RFC4761] defined a Control Flags Bit Vector as part of the
   Layer2 Info Extended Community, it did not ask for the creation of a
   registry.

   This document requests that IANA creates a registry for this bit
   vector and that it be called the "Layer2 Info Extended Community
   Control Flags Bit Vector" registry.

INTERNET DRAFT         BGP Signaled FAT PW Labels          March 2, 2018


   This registry should be created here:

   https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities/bgp-
   extended-communities.xhtml.

   Considering [RFC4761] and this document, the initial registry is as
   follows:

      Value   Name                               Reference
      -----   --------------------------------   --------------
       S       Sequenced delivery of frames       RFC4761
       C       Presence of a Control Word         RFC4761
       T       Request to send a flow label       This document
       R       Ability to receive a flow label    This document

   As per [RFC4761] and this document, the remaining bits are
   unassigned, and MUST be set to zero when sending and MUST be ignored
   when receiving the Layer2 Info Extended Community.

7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing [RFC4271] and [RFC4761].
