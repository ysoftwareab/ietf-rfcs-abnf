   This document discusses requirements for the support of the Path 
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCECP) in inter-AS 
   applications. Its main objective is to present a set of requirements 
   which would result in guidelines for the definition, selection and 
   specification development for any technical solution(s) meeting these 
   requirements.

1.   Introduction 
 
   MPLS Inter-AS traffic engineering requirements [INTERAS-TE-REQ]
   defined the scenarios motivating the deployment of inter-AS MPLS 
   traffic engineering. [INTERAS-TE-REQ] also specified the requirements 
   for inter-AS MPLS traffic engineering when the ASes are under one 
   Service Provider (SP) administration or the administration of 
   different SPs. 
    
   Today, there are three signaling options in setting up an inter-AS 
   TE LSP: 1) contiguous TE LSP as documented in [INTERD-TESIG]; 2) 
   Stitched inter-AS TE LSP discussed in [LSP-STITCHING]; 3) nested TE 
   LSP as in[LSP-HIERARCHY]. In addition, [INTERD-TE-PDPC] defines 
   mechanisms for inter-domain path computation using network elements 
   along the signaling and data paths.  The mechanisms in [INTERD-TE- 
   PDPC] do not provide the capability to guarantee an optimum TE path 
   across multiple ASes. A (G)MPLS-TE optimum path for an LSP is one 
   that has the smallest cost, according to a normalized TE metric

   (based upon a TE-metric or IGP metric adopted in each transit AS), 
   among all possible paths that satisfy the LSP TE-constraints. 
    
   The requirements for a PCE have risen from SP needs to compute a more 
   optimum path than that can be achieved by mechanisms provided 
   in[INTERD-TE-PDPC], and be able to separate the path computation 
   elements from the forwarding elements. 
    
   Generic requirements for the PCE discovery protocol (PCEDP) and 
   PCC/PCE-PCE communication protocol (PCECP) are discussed in [PCEDP-
   REQ] and [PCECP-REQ], respectively. Complementary to these already-
   defined generic requirements, this document provides a set of PCECP 
   requirements that are specific to (G)MPLS-TE inter-AS path 
   computation using a PCE-based approach. 
    
   Section 2 of this document states some definitions. Section 3 defines 
   a reference model, while section 4 describes use cases of inter-AS 
   path computation using a PCE-based approach. Section 5 states inter-
   AS PCECP requirements when the ASes are under a single SP 
   administrative domain. Section 5 also discusses additional 
   requirements for inter-AS multi-SP PCE applications related to 
   confidentiality and policies. Section 6 discusses security issues.

   Figure 1 depicts the reference model for PCEs in an inter-AS
   application. In this document, we define two types of PCE functions: 
   inter-AS PCEs and intra-AS PCEs. Figure 1 shows the case where there 
   are three ASes, each having an inter-AS PCE. Each inter-AS PCE 
   communicates with inter-AS PCEs of neighboring ASes to compute inter-
   AS (G)MPLS-TE paths. An inter-AS PCE may also communicate with intra-
   AS PCEs within the scope of its AS to compute a path segment within 
   its AS. An inter-AS PCE can be an external server that is not part of 
   the routing topology or an LSR (e.g., ASBR),known as composite PCE, 
   as described in [PCE-ARCH]).

      Figure 1: Inter and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model  
        
   In general, an inter-AS PCE is associated with one ore more ASes that      
   Defines its scope. It receives path computation requests for (G)MPLS-
   TE LSPs from PCCs or other inter-AS PCEs and responds to these 
   requests. An intra-AS PCE (e.g., inter-area PCE) is one responsible 
   for path computation within a single AS. It should be emphasized that 
   the differentiation between these two PCE types is functional as both 
   can be implemented and enabled on the same physical device, but 
   scalability requirements and/or security considerations may require 
   their separation. An inter-AS PCE can be an intermediate-PCE or a 
   terminating-PCE for a given LSP. An intermediate-PCE is associated 
   with transit ASes whereas a terminating-PCE is associated with the AS     
   originating or terminating the path computation request. If the head-
   end and tail-end of an LSP are in ASes within the scope of a single 
   inter-AS PCE, the full path computation can be solely done by that 
   inter-AS PCE, possibly cooperating with other intra-AS PCEs if it 
   does not have the full topological and TE knowledge of the ASes 
   within its scope. Otherwise, multiple inter-AS PCEs need to cooperate 
   to compute the LSP path as described in [PCE-ARCH].   
        
   The LSR at the head-end of an LSP or a proxy on its behalf (either   
   being a PCC) sends a path computation request to one of its inter- 
   AS PCEs upon determining, via configuration or dynamic routing, that 
   the tail-end is an AS-external destination. There could be one or 
   more inter-AS PCEs associated with a given LSR AS. The selection of 
   an inter-AS PCE among many can be based on the corresponding 
   destination AS, configuration, and/or load-balancing criteria. An 
   inter-AS PCE in the originating AS sends a path computation request 
   to one or more neighboring AS-PCEs based on the AS(es) through which 
   it learned reachability (maybe the best path ) to the destination 
   tail-end and/or based on policy. Each neighboring inter-AS PCE that 
   receives the request determines its "downstream" neighbor inter-AS 
   PCE that it progresses the path request to. In determining the 
   "downstream" inter-AS PCE to which the path request must be sent, an 
   inter-AS PCE may first qualify the path to an ASBR associated with 
   that inter-AS PCE and may exclude paths that do not satisfy the 
   constraints of the LSP (e.g., by excluding ASBRs and inter-AS links 
   between the two neighboring ASes when there is not sufficient 
   bandwidth on the paths to these ASBRs or ASes to sastisfy the LSP 
   bandwidth constraints). Before an inter-AS PCE decides to send a path

   computation request to a neighbor inter-AS PCE, it may also qualify 
   the paths to the neighbor AS by consulting its intra-AS PCE(s). When 
   setting up a bi-directional LSP using GMPLS signaling, a PCE may 
   qualify the path in both directions according to the LSP constraints.  
    
   In an all-PCE enabled environment, the last inter-AS PCE, serving the     
   AS of the LSP tail-end computes one or more path in the AS(es) within 
   its scope by cooperating with intra-AS PCEs. If the immediate 
   requestor (e.g., the previous inter-AS PCE) is under another SP 
   administrative domain, the inter-AS PCE may not return a path with 
   strict hops. What could be returned in the path computation response 
   can be generally controlled by policy configuration. The inter-AS PCE 
   may return one or more paths, each of which is composed of a list of 
   one or more ASBRs and/or ASes as loose hops and a cost associated 
   with each path. The returned path(s) must at least include ASBRs 
   connected to the ASes affiliated with the responding PCE. This 
   process proceeds recursively until the inter-AS PCE serving the LSP 
   head-end receives a response to its request(s) from the immediate 
   inter-AS PCE(s) it sent requests to. Every time an inter-AS PCE 
   responds to a requestor it concatenates each path it computes with a 
   path it received from the next immediate PCE, composes a cost for the 
   total path and returns the concatenated path(s) to the previous 
   immediate requestor. It should be noted that the path(s) computed by 
   a PCE will be constrained by the path(s) received from the next 
   inter-AS PCE(s) and any other constraints in the received request.    
        
   If the original PCC (LSR at the head-end of the LSP or proxy) selects     
   a path out of the received ones and the path is composed of all 
   strict hops, the head-end LSR will use the signaling procedures 
   defined in [INTERD-TESIG] to signal the LSP with an explicit route 
   object (ERO) consisting of these strict hops. There will be no need 
   for computing path segments to loose hops at intermediate nodes. If 
   the path selected by the head-end LSR is composed of strict and loose 
   hops, there needs to be a way for an intermediate node to complete 
   the path between that node and the next loose hop with strict hops. 
   How this is most efficiently done SHOULD be subject for further 
   study.  
 
4.   Application Scenarios  
 
    4.1. Inter-AS Path Computation for Virtual PoP (VPOP) or 
         Sub-regional Networks  
    
   A number of application scenarios are discussed in section 4 of 
   [INTERAS-TE-REQ] where computing an inter-AS TE-LSP path could rely    
   on per-domain path computation using procedures documented in 
   [INTERD-TE-PDPC]. However, as noted above, a per-domain computing 
   method does not always yield optimum paths. In this section, a 
   similar inter-AS TE application scenario using PCEs with inter-AS 
   scope to compute optimum paths across AS boundaries is presented.

   Section 4.1.1 and section 4.2.2 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ] have presented 
   two cases where a global service provider (SP1) would like to extend 
   its reach into a region using a regional network (SP2) as MPLS 
   transport.  SP1 in these cases would either co-locate its regional 
   POP as a virtual PoP within SP2's POP or link its own sub-regional 
   network back to SP1's main backbone over SP2's network. This is 
   further illustrated in the diagram of Figure 2:

   In the example diagram depicted in Figure 2, ASBRs R13 and R14 as 
   PCCs, dynamically or statically discover their corresponding PCEs R16 
   and R18 which in turn maintain meshed peering with AS2 PCEs R26 and 
   R27. R13 and R14 then send PCC/PCE path requests to their own primary 
   PCEs (R16 or R18) for two optimum yet diversified inter-AS paths for 
   T1(R13,R15) and T2(R14,R17) across AS2. In addition, R11 require 
   building a separate inter-TE tunnel (T3) to R113 directly to support 
   a customer voice-trunk, for example.    
        
   With per-domain path computation, the three tunnels (T1, T2, and T3) 
   would be built with paths as shown below, assuming all links have a 
   metric value of 1 and all inter-AS links between ASes have the same 
   maximum reservable bandwidth:  
        
   - T1's path: (R13,R15) expanding at R21 to have the path R13-R21-R23-
   R26-R15;  
   - T2's path: (R14,R17) expanding at R22 to have the path R14-R22-R27-
   R17;  
   - T3's path: (R11,R113) expanding at R21 to have the path R11-R13-
   R21-R23-R26-R15-R17-R113

Internet Draft  draft-bitar-zhang-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   February 2006 


         
   For T1 and T2, the requirement for diversification is paramount where 
   R26 and R27 (as PCEs) will need to maintain synchronized states of 
   both T1 and T2 in order to compute two diverse routes for these two 
   inter-AS TE LSPs.  
     
   For T3, a more optimum path should be R11-R14-R22-R27-R17-R113 which 
   can be obtained through AS1 PCEs (R16 or R17) where R22 and R17 are 
   selected as better exits for neighbor ASes.  
        
   In this environment, PCE R24 in AS2 is only for intra-AS TE path 
   computation while R26 and R27 are intra-AS PCEs as well as inter-AS  
   PCEs for AS1 among others. R16 and R17 are dedicated routers running 
   PCE process for AS2.  
     
   Please note that we could also configure R13 and R14 as PCEs with 
   direct peering to R26 and R27.  In this case, the ASBR routers 
   function as the PCE, PCC and the inter-AS tunnel-head end or tail-end 
   at the same time. It is also worth noting that the reachability 
   between R13 and R14 and their primary PCEs (R16 and R18) will be 
   required via, for example either static or BGP routing in the global 
   space across inter-ASBR links.       
    
    4.2.          Inter-AS Path Computation over a GMPLS Transport Core  
 
   This section illustrates a simplified case where inter-AS scoped PCEs 
   are used for path computations across a GMPLS transport core.    
         
   (PCC)                                                     (PCC)  
   R1--ASBR1(PCE)<==>ASBR2(PCE)-GMPLS-ASBR3(PCE)<==>ASBR4(PCE)--R2

   +===SP1 AS1===+  +=======SP2 As2=============+  +===SP3 AS3===+    
     
   Figure 3 Inter-AS TE LSP over a GMPLS Transport Core  
     
   In Figure 3, R1 (a PCC) sends an MPLS-TE based request message to its        
   own PCE ASBR1 to compute an inter-As TE LSP between R1 and R2. ASBR1 
   in turns requests path computation from its downstream peering PCE, 
   ASBR2, for this LSP to AS3 via AS2.  This would require ASBR2 to have 
   the ability to receive MPLS-TE based request messages and reinterpret 
   the portion corresponding to GMPLS specific attributes (if any) for 
   carrying out path computations.  
        
   In this application scenario, AS2 is a pure GMPLS core.  It is worth 
   noting that AS2 could have outer MPLS edge where the inter-AS TE LSPs 
   may get aggregated onto the GMPLS TE LSP on the core GMPLS PSC.

Internet Draft  draft-bitar-zhang-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   February 2006 


   This section discusses detailed PCECP requirements in two principal   
   areas for inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE path computtion using a PCE-based 
   approach: 1) requirements for inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE in the same SP 
   administrative domain (i.e., intra-provider) and 2) requirements for 
   inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE/ across different SP administrative domains 
   (i.e., inter-provider).  
    
   5.1.          Requirements within one SP Administrative Domain  
     
   This section presents detailed PCECP requirements for inter-AS 
   (G)MPLS-TE within the same SP administrative domain. It should be 
   noted that ASes in a single SP administrative domain can have various 
   restrictions and policies among the ASes, as in the inter-provider 
   case. The additional PCE requirements for the inter-provider case are 
   documented in section 5.2.  
     
   
     
   5.1.1.       PCC/PCE-PCE Communication Protocol Requirements  
     
   Requirements specific to requests or responses are discussed in the 
   next subsections. Following are additional requirements to those 
   described in [PCECP-REQ] for PCC/PCE-PCE communication. Some of these 
   requirements apply to the process handling PCC/PCE-PCE communication 
   and not the protocol itself:  
    
   - An inter-AS PCE must be able to locally prioritize messages on an 
   AS basis in addition to message-level priority.   
    
   - An inter-AS PCE must be able to change the message priority when 
   sending a path computation request from the priority it received for 
   the same LSP. A notification message should be sent to the requestor 
   indicating that change. Such notification must be suppressed by 
   configuration action on a neighboring inter-AS PCE basis.  
       
   - An inter-AS PCE must be able to perform translation on class-type 
   identifiers carried in a request/response for a DS-TE packet-LSP when 
   the two ASes attempting to set an LSP or LSP segment between them use 
   different class-type identifier values. Such a situation may arise 
   when ASes become part of one service provider domain as a result of 
   mergers and acquisitions.  
       
   - In inter-AS operation, an inter-AS PCE must be able to silently 
   drop PCECP messages arriving from an AS that it does not wish to 
   communicate with. It must also be able to limit the aggregate rate of 
   PCECP requests/responses arriving from PCEs affiliated with one ore 
   more ASes or from a group of one or more ASes by silently droping 
   messages when a pre-configured rate threshold is exceeded.

   5.1.1.1.          Requirements on path computation requests  
     
   Following are inter-AS specific requirements on PCECP requests for 
   path computation 
    
   - Path computation requests must be able to carry all constraint 
   attributes necessary for setting up an LSP via (G)MPLS-TE signaling 
   as stated in [PCECP-REQ]. A path computation request to an inter-AS 
   PCE must be able to specify ASBRs and/or ASes as strict and loose 
   nodes in the path of the LSP to the destination. A PCE must also be 
   able to specify a preferred ASBR for exiting to the next AS and 
   reach the destination through that AS.   
        
   - An inter-AS PCE must be able to specify in its request a list 
   of ASes and/or ASBRs to be excluded in the path computation. It must 
   also be able to include links with specific affinity in the 
   exclude/include list. Boundary policies can be deployed to interpret 
   and translate incoming affinity to one significant to the local AS.  
    
   - If an inter-AS PCE learns reachability to a destination from 
   different ASes, it should be able to send simultaneous requests to 
   the inter-AS PCEs associated with these ASes. The maximum number of 
   inter-AS PCEs, an inter-AS PCE may send simultaneous requests to, 
   SHOULD be configurable. The choice of inter-AS PCEs could be 
   influenced by policies which prefer some paths over others or some 
   PCEs over others. When sending simultaneous requests, the tradeoff 
   between signaling and path computation activity on one hand and the 
   likelihood of setting an end-to-end optimum path should be 
   considered.  
    
   - The PCC/PCE-PCE communication protocol must enable an inter-AS PCE 
   to specify the AS on whose behalf it is sending the request. This is 
   specifically important when the inter-AS PCE has identified many ASes 
   within its scope to the other inter-AS PCE at the other end of the 
   communication.   
    
   - A PCC or PCE (including inter-AS PCE) must be able to specify in 
   its request the need for computing an end-end path with protection 
   against node and/or link, and/or SRLG  failure using 1:1 detours or 
   facility backup. An inter-AS PCE may itself ask for a similarly 
   protected path. In addition, it may ask for protection across all 
   ASes the path can traverse or across specific ASes. A path 
   computation client must also be able to ask for a minimum of two 
   paths that are diversified (i.e., do not share common nodes, links or 
   SRLGs) its request to an inter-AS PCE.  
         
   - An inter-AS PCE must be able to reject a request based on policies 
   applied at a neighboring AS basis. Such policies may include any 
   valid request attributes, including class-types for packet LSPs, 
   bandwidth that exceeds a preset threshold per LSP or AS, preemption 
   priorities, setup priorities, restriction on links with certain

Internet Draft  draft-bitar-zhang-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   February 2006 


   affinities, and desired protection. When a path request is rejected, 
   the requestor must be informed of the rejection reason along with any 
   information that may help the requestor avoid the points and/or 
   reasons of rejections in subsequent requests.    
   
   5.1.1.2.          Requirements on path computation responses  
     
   Following are inter-AS specific requirements on PCECP responses for 
   path computation: 
 
   - A path computation response must be able to include nodes (e.g., 
   ASBRs), abstract nodes such as ASes, and links as described in [PCE-
   ARCH]. In inter-AS intra-provider path computation, there may not be 
   any confidentiality issues or restrictions that prevent one AS from 
   returning a path with strict hops and no loose hops (i.e., nodes and 
   links) within its AS to the requesting inter-AS PCE. In this case, 
   the head-end of an LSP could receive, as a result of the work of 
   multiple cooperating intra-AS and inter-AS PCEs, a path that contains 
   nodes and links as strict hops from LSP head-end to tail-end.   
    
   - In a path computation response, each path must contain the ASBR 
   that connects to the requestor AS at a minimum.  In addition, a cost 
   associated with each path should be returned to enable selection of 
   an optimum end-end path. The cost could reflect the cumulative 
   administrative cost of the path. The PCC/PCE-PCE PCECP must be able 
   to carry this information.  
     
   - In its response, an inter-AS PCE must identify diversified paths, 
   when it is requested to compute such paths. End-to-end diversified 
   paths are paths that do not share nodes, links or SRLGs 
   except for the LSP head-end and tail-end. In cases, where diversified 
   path segments are desired within one or more ASes, the diversified 
   path segments may share only the ASBRs of the first AS and the ASBR 
   of the last AS across these ASes.   
        
   - If an inter-AS PCE cannot find a path to the destination or it 
   cannot find a path that satisfies the LSP constraints, it must send 
   a reject-type message to the requestor with a reject reason. Upon 
   receiving this reject message, an inter-AS PCE or a PCC SHOULD 
   attempt an alternative path by sending a request to an alternative 
   AS-PCE. If it exhausted all AS-PCEs it SHOULD send a reject message 
   to the previous requesting inter-AS PCE if there is one.

   5.1.2.       Scalability and Performance Requirements  
     
   When evaluating a PCECP for inter-AS case, the following scalability 
   and performance criteria SHOULD be considered:  
        
   - Message load on the inter-AS PCEs and intra-AS PCEs. 
   - Scalability with network size, number of inter-AS PCEs, number of 
   intra-AS PCEs and the effect of these parameters on PCC/PCE-PCE 
   sessions  
   - Added complexity and features to the PCC/PCE-PCE communication 
   protocol  
     
   5.1.3.       Complexity and Risks  
     
   The proposed solution(s) SHOULD NOT introduce unnecessary complexity 
   to the current operating network to such a degree that it would 
   affect the stability and diminish the benefits of deploying such 
   a solution over SP networks.   
     
   5.1.4.     Management, Aliveness Detection and Recovery Requirements  
     
   Especially, in terms of MIB, inter-AS PCEs should support a specific 
   inter-AS traffic engineering MIB as specified in section 5.1.10.1 of 
   [INTERAS-TE-REQ]. This MIB relates to security consideration in this 
   document. The new MIB module must provide trap functions when 
   thresholds are crossed or when important events occur for inter-AS 
   PCEs.  
        
   The built-in diagnostic tools must detect failures of PCC/PCE-PCE 
   PCECP and allow checking the status of PCECP related to inter-AS 
   PCEs. The new MIB module should support the status of PCECP related 
   to inter-AS PCEs. Here, it is assumed that inter-AS PCEs exist in 
   different AS or different SP administrative domains.   
        
   Basic aliveness detection for PCC/PCE-PCE communication is described 
   in [PCECP-REQ]. Specifically, the PCECP must allow an inter-AS PCE to 
   check the liveliness of the neighboring inter-AS PCE(s) it is 
   communicating with for inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE path computation.  
        
   Basic PCC/PCE failure response is described in [PCECP-REQ]. But, an 
   inter-AS PCE must address inter-AS PCE to inter-AS PCE communication 
   failure response. It must be defined how an inter-AS PCE deals with 
   the failures of neighboring inter-AS PCEs. It is recommended that an 
   inter-AS PCE selects another neighboring inter-AS PCE that serves the 
   same AS or group of ASes so that to obtain equivalent coverage, on 
   detection of an inter-AS PCE failure or non-rechability of an inter-
   AS PCE. But note that inter-AS PCE selection procedure is out of the 
   scope of this document.

    5.2.     Requirements Across SP Administrative Domains  
   
   The inter-AS PCECP requirements in the inter-provider case include 
   all requirements discussed in section 5.1 in addition to those 
   discussed in this section. Please also note that the SP with 
   multiple ASes may choose not to include inter-provider inter-AS 
   PCE requirements presented here in its inter-AS TE implementation 
   within its own administrative domain.  
     
   5.2.1.       Confidentiality  
     
   Each SP will in most cases designate some PCEs for inter-AS (G)MPLS-
   TE path computation within its own administrative domain and some 
   other PCEs for inter-provider inter-As (G)MPLS-TE path computation.  
   Among the inter-provider-scoped inter-AS PCEs in each SP domain, 
   there may also be a subset of the PCEs specifically enabled for path 
   computation across a specific set of ASes of different peer SPs.     
        
   PCECP should allow an SP to hide from other SPs the set of hops, 
   within its own AS(es,) traversed by an inter-AS inter-provider 
   (G)MPLS-TE LSP (c.f., Section 5.2.1 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ]).  In a 
   multi-SP administrative domain environment, SPs want to hide their 
   network topologies for security reasons. In addition, SPs do not want 
   to reveal the path traversed by an LSP segment within their domains 
   to other SPs' domains. Thus, for each partial inter-AS LSP path a PCE 
   computes, it should return to its peering PCE in the upstream 
   neighbor AS(es) an inter-AS TE LSP  segment from its own AS(es) 
   without detailing the explicit intra-AS hops plus partial paths with 
   an aggregated TE LSP cost it receives from its downstream PCE. A PCE 
   should be able to compute the inter-AS TE LSP across AS boundaries 
   without detailed knowledge of the list of hops, TE link metrics and 
   paths within each transit AS.   
     
   5.2.2.       Policy Controls Effecting inter-AS PCECP 
     
   Section 5.2.2. of [INTERAS-TE-REQ] discusses the policy control 
   requirements on the inter-AS RSVP-TE signaling at the AS boundaries 
   for the enforcement of interconnect agreements, attribute/parameter 
   translation and security hardening.    
        
   This section discusses those policy control requirements for PCECP.  
   Please note that SPs may still require ingress policy controls on the 
   actual signaling paths mentioned above to enforce their bilateral or 
   multi-lateral agreements at the AS boundaries.  
        
   5.2.2.1.          Inter-AS PCE Peering Policy Controls  
     
   A PCE SHOULD have the ability to enforce policies, defined for a set 
   of parameters listed in section 5.2.2.1 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ], on the 
   incoming PCECP path computation requests. 
        

 
Bitar, Zhang et al.                                          [Page 13] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-bitar-zhang-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   February 2006 


   In a multi-SP administrative domain environment, each SP itself has 
   some policies for a (G)MPLS-TE enabled network. An inter-AS PCE sends 
   path computation requests with some parameters to its neighboring 
   inter-AS PCEs. In terms of parameters, see section 5.2.2.1 of 
   [INTERAS-TE-REQ]. In this case, an inter-AS PCE enforces some 
   policies applied to its neighboring inter-AS PCEs. These policies may 
   include rewriting some of the parameters' values or rejecting 
   requests based on some parameters' values. Inter-AS PCEs should also 
   have the ability to exclude and/or filter internally-scoped 
   information and capability information based on policies. Such 
   policies may also be applied in the case of multiple ASes within a 
   single SP administrative domain.  
    
   For path computation requests that are not compliant with configured 
   policies, the policy enforcing PCE SHOULD generate an error message 
   to the requesting PCC or PCE indicating the cause of errors or a 
   reject message with a reason.  
     
   5.2.2.2.            Inter-AS PCE Reinterpretation Polices  
     
   Each SP may have different definitions in its use of for example, 
   RSVP-TE session attributes, DS-TE TE classes, etc.  The PCEs 
   receiving these path requests need to be able to reinterpret some of 
   the attributes and adapt them to the native environment in their own 
   AS for path computation.  A list of such parameters subject to policy 
   reinterpretation can be found in section 5.2.2.2 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ].  
   Also the transit SPs along the inter-AS TE path may be a GMPLS 
   transport provider which may require reinterpretation of MPLS 
   specific PCE path request message for path computation over a GMPLS 
   network.   
    
   The PCECP implementation SHOULD allow for the policy enforcing PCEs 
   to reinterpret some of these parameters in the incoming PCC or PCE 
   requests from other AS(es) for its own AS TE implementations or to 
   signal to PCEs in the downstream AS(es).    
     
     
     
6.   Security Considerations  
     
   Security concerns arise between any two communicating elements 
   especially when the elements belong to different administrative 
   entities. In this case, there are security concerns that need to be 
   addressed for communication among inter-AS PCEs and other PCEs in a 
   single SP administrative domain as well as among inter-AS PCEs under 
   different SP administrative domains. Following are requirements that 
   apply to inter-AS PCECP messages: 
        
   - Authentication, permission and rejection for path computation 
   requests:  
        

 
Bitar, Zhang et al.                                          [Page 14] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-bitar-zhang-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   February 2006 


   In a multi-SP administrative domain environment, SPs want to 
   authenticate inter-AS path computation requests to confirm whether 
   they should trust the requests or not. They also want to allow 
   or deny the requests after inter-AS PCEs authenticate them. 
    
   In case multiple ASes exist within a single SP administrative domain, 
   the SP may authenticate inter-AS path computation requests to confirm 
   whether it should trust the requests or not, depending on SP policy. 
   An inter-AS PCE may allow or deny the requests after it authenticates 
   them. Inter-AS PCEs should also be able to authenticate inter-AS 
   PCECP path computation responses.
    
   Inter-AS PCEs should be able to authenticate inter-AS path 
   computation requests and confirm whether they should allow or deny 
   them. Inter-AS PCEs should be able to authenticate all PCECP 
   messages. 
     
        
   - Traffic policing: In multi-SP administrative domain environment or 
   in case multiple ASes exist within a single SP administrative domain, 
   inter-AS PCEs may receive a large number of PCE requests within a 
   short time (i.e., resulting in a high path-computation-request rate). 
   Inter-AS PCEs should be able to limit the amount of PCE requests.  
    
   - Protection from DoS attacks: In multi-SP administrative domain 
   environment, inter-AS PCEs may be subject to malicious DoS attacks 
   using PCECP. Inter-AS PCEs should be able protect themselves from 
   such attacks.  
    
   - PCC/PCE spoofing: In multi-SP administrative domain environment, 
   inter-AS PCEs have the possibility of spoofing the PCC/PCE-PCE 
   communication. Inter-AS PCEs should have functions to avoid spoofing 
   PCC/PCE-PCE communication.
