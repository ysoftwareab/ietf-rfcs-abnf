Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for SPIRIT IP-MR    November 2007

1. Introduction
  This document specifies the payload format for packetization of 
  SPIRIT IP-MR encoded speech signals into the Real-time Transport 
  Protocol (RTP). The payload format supports transmission of multiple 
  frames per payload, introduced redundancy for robustness against 
  packet loss, and payload format extension for future versions 
  compatibility.

2. IP-MR RTP Payload Formats
  The payload has two formats: standard optimized for current use-cases 
  and extended for future versions compatibility. The payload format is 
  defined by first bit of header. Both of these formats will be 
  described bellow.

2.1. Standard Payload Format

2.1.1. Payload Format Structure

  The standard payload consists of a payload header with general 
  information about packet, a speech table of contents (TOC), and 
  speech data. An optional redundancy section follows after speech 
  data. The redundancy section consists of redundancy header, 
  redundancy TOC and redundancy data payload. 
  The following diagram shows the standard payload format layout:
  +---------+--------+--------+- - - - - - +- - - - - - +- - - - - - +
  | payload | speech | speech | redundancy | redundancy | redundancy |
  | header  | TOC    | data   | header     | TOC        | data       |
  +---------+--------+--------+- - - - - - +- - - - - - +- - - - - - +

2.1.2. Payload Header

  The payload header has the following format:
   0                   1
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |T| CR  | BR  |D|A|GR |R|
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  
  o  T (1 bit): Reserved compatibility with future extensions. Should be set
  to 0.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for SPIRIT IP-MR    November 2007

  o  CR (3 bits): coding rate of frame(s) in this packet, as per the 
     following table:
               +-------+--------------+
               |  CR   | avg. bitrate |
               +-------+--------------+
               |   0   |   7.7 kbps   |
               |   1   |   9.8 kbps   |
               |   2   |  14.3 kbps   |
               |   3   |  20.8 kbps   |
               |   4   |  27.9 kbps   |
               |   5   |  34.2 kbps   |
               |   6   |  (reserved)  |
               |   7   |   NO_DATA    |
               +-------+--------------+
  Table 1 Coding rates of IP-MR codec

  The CR value 7 (NO_DATA) indicates that there is no speech data (and 
  speech TOC accordingly) in the payload. This MAY be used to transmit 
  redundancy data only. The value 6 is reserved. If receiving this 
  value the packet SHOULD be discarded.

  o  BR (3 bits): base rate for core layer of frame(s) in this packet. 
     Values in the range 0-5 indicate bitrates for core layer, same as 
     for CR. Values 6 and 7 are reserved. If one of these values is 
     received the packet SHOULD be discarded. The base rate is the 
     lowest rate for scalability, so speech payload can be scaled down 
     not lower than BR value. If a received packet has BR > CR then 
     during decoding it will be assumed that BR = CR.

  o  D (1 bit): indicates if the DTX mode is allowed or not.

  o  A (1 bit): byte-aligned payload. If A=1 then all speech frames 
     MUST be byte-aligned. This mode speeds up speech data access. The 
     A=0 value specifies bandwidth-efficient mode with no byte 
     alignment (including end of header).

  o  GR (2 bits): number of frames in packet (grouping size). Actual 
     grouping size is GR + 1, thus maximum grouping supported is 4. If 
     greater grouping size is required the extended payload format 
     (sec. 2.2) MAY be used.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for SPIRIT IP-MR    November 2007

  o  R (1 bit): redundancy presence bit. If R=1 then the packet 
     contains redundancy information for lost packets recovery. In this 
     case after speech TOC redundancy flags and TOC sections are 
     present. If R=0 then speech TOC is the last section of payload 
     header.

2.1.3. Speech Table of Contents

  The speech TOC contains entries for each frame in packet (grouping 
  size in total). Each entry contains a single field:

   0
  +-+
  |E|
  +-+
  
  o  E (1 bit): frame existence indicator. If set to 0, this indicates 
     the corresponding frame is absent and the receiver should set the 
     teRxFrType to LOST_FRAME. This can be followed by the lost frame 
     itself or by empty frames generated by the encoder during silence 
     intervals in DTX mode.
     
  Note that if CR field from coding flags is 7 (NO_DATA) then speech 
  TOC is empty.

2.1.4. Speech Data

  Speech data of a payload contains one or more speech frames or 
  comfort noise frames, as specified in the speech TOC of the payload.

  Each speech frame represents 20 ms of speech encoded with the rate 
  indicated in the CR and base rate indicated in BR field of the 
  payload header. The length of the speech frame is variable due to the 
  nature of the codec and can be calculated after decoding or by using 
  GetFrameInfo function detailed in [1].

2.1.5. Redundancy Header

  If a packet contains redundancy (R field of payload header is 1) the 
  speech data is followed by redundancy header:

   0 1 2 3 4 5 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+
  | CL1 | CL2 |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+
  
  Redundancy header consists of two fields. Each field contains class 
  specifier for redundancy partly taken from the preceding packet (CL1) 
  and pre-preceding packet (CL2), e.g. distant from the current packet 
  by 1 and 2 packets accordingly. The values are listed in the table 
  below:
            +-------+-------------------+
            |  CL   | amount redundancy |
            +-------+-------------------+
            |   0   |       NONE        |
            |   1   |      CLASS A      |
            |   2   |      CLASS B      |
            |   3   |      CLASS C      |
            |   4   |      CLASS D      |
            |   5   |      CLASS E      |
            |   6   |      CLASS F      |
            |   7   |     (reserved)    |
            +-------+-------------------+

  Each specifier takes 3 bits, thus the total redundancy header size is 
  6 bits. In case of redundancy usage followed by preceding (or pre-
  preceding) packet loss the receiver sets the special flag for decoder 
  with CL class specifier.

2.1.6. Redundancy Table of Contents

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  | Pkt1 Entries| Pkt2 Entries|
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  
  The redundancy TOC contains entries for redundancy frames from 
  preceding and pre-preceding packets. Each entry takes 1 bit like 
  speech TOC entry (2.1.3):
   0
  +-+
  |E|
  +-+
  
  o  E (1 bit): frame existence indicator. If set to 0, this indicates 
     the corresponding frame is absent.

  o  For each preceding and pre-preceding packet the number of entries 
     is equal to the grouping size of the current packet. E.g. maximum 
     number of entries is 4*2 = 8.

  o  If class specifier in the redundancy header is CL=0 (NO_DATA) then 
     there?s no entries for corresponding packet redundancy.

2.1.7. Redundancy Data

  Redundancy data of a payload contains redundancy information for one 
  or more speech frames or comfort noise frames that may be lost during 
  transition, as specified in the redundancy TOC of the payload. 
  Actually redundancy is the most important part of preceding frames 
  representing 20 ms of speech. The length of redundancy frame is 
  variable and can be calculated after decoding or by using 
  GetFrameInfo function detailed in [1].

2.2.1. Standard Payload Carrying a Single Frame

  The following diagram shows a standard IP-MR payload carrying a 
  single speech frame without redundancy:

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                                                               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                                                               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                                                               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                                                               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                      sp(193)|P| 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  In the payload the speech frame is not damaged at the IP origin 
  (E=1), the coding rate is 9.7 kbps (CR=1), the base rate is 7.8 kbps 
  (BR=0), and the DTX mode is off. There is no byte alignment (A=0) and 
  no redundancy (R=0). The encoded speech bits - s(0) to s(193) - are 
  placed immediately after TOC. Finally, one zero bit is added at the 
  end as padding to make the payload byte aligned.

2.2.2. Standard Payload Carrying Multiple Frames with Redundancy

  The following diagram shows a payload that contains three frames, one 
  of them with no speech data.  The coding rate is 7.7 kbps (CR=0), the 
  base rate is 7.7 kbps (BR=0), and the DTX mode is on. The speech 
  frames are byte aligned (A=1), so 1 zero bit is added at the end of 
  the header. Besides the speech frames the payload contains six 
  redundancy frames (three per each delayed packet). 

  The first speech frame consists of bits sp1(0) to sp1(92). After that 
  3 bits are added for byte alignment. The second frame does not 
  contain any speech information that is represented in the payload by 
  its TOC entry. The third frame consists of bits sp3(0) to sp3(171).

  The redundancy header follows after speech data. The one-packet-
  delayed redundancy contains class A+B bits (CL1=2), and two-packet-
  delayed redundancy contains class A bits (Cl2=1). The one-packet-
  delayed redundancy contains three frames with 20, 39 and 35 bits 
  respectively. The first frame of two-packet-delayed redundancy is 
  absent, it is represented in its TOC entry, and two other frames have 
  sizes 15 and 19 bits.
  
  Note that all speech frames are padded with zero bits for byte 
  alignment.

  The standard header is the same as in example 2.3.1 except for the 
  first bit that is set to 1 to reflect extended payload type. The 
  standard header is padded with zeros to achieve byte alignment. After 
  that the size of header extension follows (HESZ=3). Then the header 
  extension data is placed. In 3 bytes (HESZ) from header extension 
  beginning, the standard speech payload starts. After that, the 
  optional payload extension MAY be added.

3. Media Type Registration

  This section describes the media types and names associated with this 
  payload format.

3.1. Registration of MIME media type audio/ip-mr_v2.5

  Type name: audio

  Subtype name: 	 ip-mr_v2.5

A.Setsko                  Expires July 23, 2008                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for SPIRIT IP-MR    November 2007

  Required parameters:	none

  Optional parameters: 

  o  ptime: Gives the length of time in milliseconds represented by the 
     media in a packet. Allowed values are: 20, 40, 60 and 80.

  Encoding considerations:
     This media type is framed binary data (see RFC 4288, Section 4.8).

  Security considerations: See RFC 3550

  Applications that use this media type:
      Audio and video streaming and conferencing tools.

  Additional information: none

  Person & email address to contact for further information:
     Andrey Setsko <Setsko@spiritdsp.com>

  Intended usage: COMMON

  Restrictions on usage:
     This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only
     defined for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550).

     Andrey Setsko

3.2. Mapping Media Type Parameters into SDP
  
  The information carried in the media type specification has a 
  specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
  [RFC4566], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP 
  is used to specify sessions employing the IP-MR codec, the mapping is   
  as follows:

  o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

  o  The media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as 
     the encoding name. The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST 16000.

  o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and 
     "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for SPIRIT IP-MR    November 2007

  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying 
  them directly from the media type parameter string as a semicolon-
  separated list of parameter=value pairs.

4. Security Considerations

  RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
  are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
  specification [RFC3550], and any appropriate RTP profile.  This 
  implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by 
  encryption.  Encryption may be performed after compression so there 
  is no conflict between the two operations.

  This payload format does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity 
  in the receiver side computational complexity for packet processing, 
  and thus is unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the 
  receipt of pathological data.
