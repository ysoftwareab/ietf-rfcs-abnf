 Observations on the Dropping of Packets with IPv6 Extension Headers in
                             the Real World
               draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world-02

Abstract

   This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which
   packets with IPv6 extension headers are dropped in the Internet (as
   originally measured in August 2014 and later in June 2015, with
   similar results), and where in the network such dropping occurs.  The
   aforementioned results serve as a problem statement that is expected
   to trigger operational advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets
   carrying IPv6 Extension Headers, so that the situation improves over
   time.  This document also explains how the aforementioned results
   were obtained, such that the corresponding measurements can be
   reproduced by other members of the community and repeated over time
   to observe changes in the handling of packets with IPv6 extension
   headers.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) allow for the extension of the IPv6
   protocol, and provide support for core functionality such as IPv6
   fragmentation.  While packets employing IPv6 Extension Headers have
   been suspected to be dropped in some IPv6 deployments, there was not
   much concrete data on the topic.  Some preliminary measurements have
   been presented in [PMTUD-Blackholes], [Gont-IEPG88] and

   [Gont-Chown-IEPG89], whereas [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90] presents more
   comprehensive results on which this document is based.

   This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which
   packets containing IPv6 Extension Headers are dropped in the
   Internet, as measured in August 2014 and later in June 2015 with
   similar results (pending operational advice in this area).  The
   results presented in this document indicate that in the scenarios
   where the corresponding measurements were performed, the use of IPv6
   extension headers can lead to packet drops.  We note that, in
   particular, packet drops occurring at transit networks are
   undesirable, and it is hoped and expected that this situation will
   improve over time.

2.  Support of IPv6 Extension Headers in the Internet

   This section summarizes the results obtained when measuring the
   support of IPv6 Extension Headers on the path towards different types
   of public IPv6 servers.  Two sources of information were employed for
   the list of public IPv6 servers: the "World IPv6 Launch Day" site
   (http://www.worldipv6launch.org/) and Alexa's top 1M web sites
   (http://www.alexa.com).  For each list of domain names, the following
   datasets were obtained:

   o  Web servers (AAAA records of the aforementioned list)

   o  Mail servers (MX -> AAAA of the aforementioned list)

   o  Name servers (NS -> AAAA of the aforementioned list)

   Duplicate addresses and IPv6 addresses other than global unicast
   addresses were eliminated from each of those lists prior to obtaining
   the results included in this document.  Additionally, addresses that
   were found to be unreachable were discarded from the dataset (please
   see Appendix B for further details).

   For each of the aforementioned address sets, three different types of
   probes were employed:

   o  IPv6 packets with a Destination Options header of 8 bytes

   o  IPv6 packets resulting in two IPv6 fragments of 512 bytes each
      (approximately)

   o  IPv6 packets with a Hop-by-Hop Options header of 8 bytes

   In the case of packets with a Destination Options Header and the case
   of packets with a Hop-by-Hop Options header, the desired EH size was

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers            December 2015


   achieved by means of PadN options [RFC2460].  The upper-layer
   protocol of the probe packets was, in all cases, TCP [RFC0793]
   segments with the Destination Port set to the service port
   [IANA-PORT-NUMBERS] of the corresponding dataset.  For example, the
   probe packets for all the measurements involving web servers were TCP
   segments with the destination port set to 80.

   Besides obtaining the packet drop rate when employing the
   aforementioned IPv6 extension headers, we tried to identify whether
   the Autonomous System (AS) dropping the packets was the same as the
   Autonomous System of the destination/target address.  This is of
   particular interest since it essentially reveals whether the packet
   drops are under the control of the intended destination of the
   packets.  Packets dropped by the destination AS are less of a
   concern, since the device dropping the packets is under the control
   of the same organization as that to which the packets are destined
   (hence, it is probably easier to update the filtering policy if
   deemed necessary).  On the other hand, packets dropped by transit
   ASes are more of a concern, since they affect the deployability and
   usability of IPv6 extension headers (including IPv6 fragmentation) by
   a third-party (the destination AS).  In any case, we note that it is
   impossible to tell whether, in those cases where IPv6 packets with
   extension headers get dropped, the packet drops are the result of an
   explicit and intended policy, or the result of improper device
   configuration defaults, buggy devices, etc.  Thus, packet drops that
   occur at the destination AS might still prove to be problematic.

   Since there is some ambiguity when identifying the autonomous system
   to which a specific router belongs (see Appendix B.2), each of our
   measurements results in two different values: one corresponding to
   the "best-case scenario", and one corresponding to the "worst-case
   scenario".  The "best-case scenario" is that in which, when in doubt,
   the packets are assumed to be dropped by the destination AS, whereas
   the "worst-case scenario" is that in which, when in doubt, the
   packets are assumed to be dropped by a transit AS (please see
   Appendix B.2 for details).  In the following tables, the values shown
   within parentheses represent the possibility that, when a packet is
   dropped, the packet drop occurs in an AS other than the destination
   AS (considering both the best-case scenario and the worst-case
   scenario).

   There are a number of observations to be made based on the results
   presented above.  Firstly, while it has been generally assumed that
   it is IPv6 fragments that are dropped by operators, our results
   indicate that it is IPv6 extension headers in general that result in
   packet drops.  Secondly, our results indicate that a significant
   percentage of such packet drops occurs in transit Autonomous Systems;

   that is, the packet drops are not under the control of the same
   organization as the final destination.

   A list of domain names (i.e., other data stripped) can be obtained
   with the following command of [IPv6-Toolkit]: "cat top-1m.csv |
   script6 get-alexa-domains > top-1m.txt".  This command will create a
   "top-1m.txt" file, containing one domain name per line.

      NOTE: The domain names corresponding to the WIPv6LD dataset is
      available at: <http://www.si6networks.com/datasets/wipv6day-
      domains.txt>.  Since the corresponding file is a text file
      containing one domain name per line, the steps produced in this
      subsection need not be performed.  The WIPv6LD data set should be
      processed in the same way as the Alexa Dataset, starting from
      Appendix A.2.

A.2.  Obtaining AAAA Resource Records

   The file obtained in the previous subsection contains a list of
   domain names that correspond to web sites.  The AAAA records for such
   domain names can be obtained with:

   $ cat top-1m.txt | script6 get-aaaa > top-1m-web-aaaa.txt

   The AAAA records corresponding to the mailservers of each of the
   aforementioned domain names can be obtained with:

   $ cat top-1m.txt | script6 get-mx | script6 get-aaaa > top-1m-mail-
   aaaa.txt

   The AAAA records corresponding to the nameservers of each of the
   aforementioned domain names can be obtained with:

   $ cat top-1m.txt | script6 get-ns | script6 get-aaaa > top-1m-dns-
   aaaa.txt

A.3.  Filtering the IPv6 Address Datasets

   The lists of IPv6 addresses obtained in the previous step could
   possibly contain undesired addresses (i.e., non-global unicast
   addresses) and/or duplicate addresses.  In order to remove both
   undesired and duplicate addresses, each of the three files from the
   previous section should be filtered accordingly:

   $ cat top-1m-web-aaaa.txt | addr6 -i -q -B multicast -B unspec -k
   global > top-1m-web-aaaa-unique.txt

   $ cat top-1m-mail-aaaa.txt | addr6 -i -q -B multicast -B unspec -k
   global > top-1m-mail-aaaa-unique.txt

Appendix B.  Measurements Caveats

   A number of issues have needed some consideration when producing the
   results presented in this document.  These same issues should be
   considered when troubleshooting connectivity problems resulting from
   the use of IPv6 Extension headers.

B.1.  Isolating the Dropping Node

   Let us assume that we find that IPv6 packets with EHs are being
   dropped on their way to the destination system 2001:db8:d::1, and
   that the output of running traceroute towards such destination is:

      1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1
      2. 2001:db8:2:4000::1
      3. 2001:db8:3:4000::1
      4. 2001:db8:3:1000::1
      5. 2001:db8:4:4000::1
      6. 2001:db8:4:1000::1
      7. 2001:db8:5:5000::1
      8. 2001:db8:5:6000::1
      9. 2001:db8:d::1

   Additionally, let us assume that the output of EH-enabled traceroute
   to the same destination is:



Gont, et al.              Expires June 12, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers            December 2015


      1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1
      2. 2001:db8:2:4000::1
      3. 2001:db8:3:4000::1
      4. 2001:db8:3:1000::1
      5. 2001:db8:4:4000::1

   For the sake of brevity, let us refer to the last-responding node in
   the EH-enabled traceroute ("2001:db8:4:4000::1" in this case) as "M".
   Assuming that packets in both traceroutes employ the same path, we'll
   refer to "the node following the last responding node in the EH-
   enabled traceroute" ("2001:db8:4:1000::1" in our case), as "M+1",
   etc.

   Based on traceroute information above, which node is the one actually
   dropping the EH-enabled packets will depend on whether the dropping
   node filters packets before making the forwarding decision, or after
   making the forwarding decision.  If the former, the dropping node
   will be M+1.  If the latter, the dropping node will be "M".

   Throughout this document (and our measurements), we assume that those
   nodes dropping packets that carry IPv6 EHs apply their filtering
   policy, and only then, if necessary, forward the packets.  Thus, in
   our example above the last responding node to the EH-enabled
   traceroute ("M") is "2001:db8:4:4000::1", and therefore we assume the
   dropping node to be "2001:db8:4:1000::1" ("M+1").

   Additionally, we note that when isolating the dropping node we assume
   that both the EH-enabled and the EH-free traceroutes result in the
   same paths.  However, this might not be the case.

B.2.  Obtaining the Responsible Organization for the Packet Drops

   In order to identify the organization operating the dropping node,
   one would be tempted to lookup the ASN corresponding to the dropping
   node.  However, assuming that M and M+1 are two peering routers, any
   of these two organizations could be providing the address space
   employed for such peering.  Or, in the case of an Internet eXchange
   Point (IXP), the address space could correspond to the IXP AS, rather
   than to any of the participating ASes.  Thus, the organization
   operating the dropping node (M+1) could be the AS for M+1, but it
   might as well be the AS for M+2.  Only when the ASN for M+1 is the
   same as the ASN for M+2 we have certainty about who the responsible
   organization for the packet drops is (see slides 21-23 of
   [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90]).

   In the measurement results presented in Section 2, the aforementioned
   ambiguity results in a "best-case" and a "worst-case" scenario
   (rather than a single value): the lowest percentage value means that,



Gont, et al.              Expires June 12, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers            December 2015


   when in doubt, we assume the packet drops occur in the same AS as the
   destination; on the other hand, the highest percentage value means
   that, when in doubt, we assume the packet drops occur at different AS
   than the destination AS.

   We note that the aforementioned ambiguity should also be considered
   when troubleshooting and reporting IPv6 packet drops, since
   identifying the organization responsible for the packet drops might
   probe to be a non-trivial task.

   Finally, we note that a specific organization might be operating more
   than one Autonomous System.  However, our measurements assume that
   different Autonomous System Numbers imply different organizations.

Appendix C.  Troubleshooting Packet Drops due to IPv6 Extension Headers

   Isolating IPv6 blackholes essentially involves performing IPv6
   traceroute for a destination system with and without IPv6 extension
   headers.  The EH-free traceroute would provide the full working path
   towards a destination, while the EH-enabled traceroute would provide
   the address of the last-responding node for EH-enabled packets (say,
   "M").  In principle, one could isolate the dropping node by looking-
   up "M" in the EH-free traceroute, with the dropping node being "M+1"
   (see Appendix B.1 for caveats).

   At the time of this writing, most traceroute implementations do not
   support IPv6 extension headers.  However, the path6 tool [path6] of
   [IPv6-Toolkit] provides such support.  Additionally, the blackhole6
   tool [blackhole6] of [IPv6-Toolkit] automates the troubleshooting
   process and can readily provide information such as: dropping node's
   IPv6 address, dropping node's Autonomous System, etc.
