               Scenario of IPv6 Transition Technologies Selection
                  draft-yang-v6ops-ipv6tran-select-03

Abstract

   Many IPv6 transition technologies has been proposed, such
   as Dual-Stack, 6rd and so on.  An CPE may support some of
   them instead of only one.  But the ISPs always support different kinds
   of transition technologies.  So they must control all the CPEs to 
   match the exact transition tech through the CPEs' management system 
   or configuring them before issuing to the customers.

1.  Problem Statement

   Nowadays, many IPv6 transitioning technologies has been proposed such
   as Dual-Stack, DS-Lite, 6rd and so on.  Each of them proposes
   individual requirment to the CPEs.  To promote the competitive
   ability of products,the CPE manufacturers certainly will try to
   support more technologies as much as possible.  Meanwhile, the
   operators tend to use single or less technologies.  Moreover, users
   can buy and use their own equipments instead of using the one which
   operator gives them, that will bring the diversity of CPEs.

   Assume that an operator uses one or more transitioning strategies in its
   network.  There are two ways to make the CPEs available.  The first
   one is to make a pre-configuration for each CPE in advance.  But,
   when the users modify the configuration or change to their own
   equipment, the connection will fail.  The Second method is to deploy
   Network Management System (NMS) to configurate all the CPEs.  Various
   CPEs from different manufactories usually need different NMS which
   means either the operator needs to maintains multiple NMS in their
   network or operator can only use one manufacturer's product in a
   subnet.  What's worse, when users buy and use their own CPE instead
   of using the original one, there will be no any solutions to
   configurate correctly except visiting service.
   
   Some specific messages need to be define between CPE and DHCP Server 
   to communicate the IPv6 transition technologies.
