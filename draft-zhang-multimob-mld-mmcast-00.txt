    Abstract 

       Mobile multicast is a research hotspot. Some mobile multicast schemes 
       was proposed, but most of them depend on the traditional group 
       membership management protocol and concern on the reconstruction of 
       multicast delivery tree by various algorithms, and they little 
       consider the mobile group membership management. So in this memo, we 
       extend the MLD protocol to support the mobile multicast group 
       management. The extension is compatible with the traditional MLD 
       protocols, and it can also be applied to the IGMP protocol to manage 
       the mobile multicast in IPv4.

    1. Introduction 

       Mobile multicast develops from the traditional multicast routing 
       protocols and the mobility support specifications to provide the 
       multicast services for mobile subscribers. Mobile IP [2] introduces 
       two basic IPv4 mobile multicast methods, called Bi-directional 
       Tunneling (BT) and Remote Subscribing (RS). The BT method forwards 
       multicast packets from the Home Agent (HA) through the unicast tunnel. 
       As a result, BT has lower join latency and does not require multicast 
       support in the foreign networks. However, the BT method introduces 
       the additional delivery overhead. The RS method transmits multicast 
       packets from current access router, so it has optimal routing. 
       However, it has long join latency and needs multicast support in the 
       foreign networks. Afterwards, some improved mobile multicast schemes 
       such as Mobile Multicast Protocol (MoM) [5] and Range-Based Mobile

    Internet-Draft        MLD Extension for MMCAST             August 2008 
        

       Multicast (RBMoM) [6] have been proposed, and they try to make the 
       trade-off between BT and RS by different multicast agent selection 
       algorithms. However, the recent research [8-9] shows that the current 
       mobile multicast schemes are not generally accepted.  

       The current study of mobile multicast mainly concerns on the 
       reconstruction algorithms, while little researches the mobile 
       multicast membership management protocols. Generally, the multicast 
       technology consists of multicast routing protocols and group 
       management protocols. The multicast routing protocols are used to set 
       up multicast delivery path, while group management protocols are used 
       to maintain the dynamic group membership. The Multicast Listener 
       Discovery (MLD) v1 [3] and MLDv2 [4] are used in IPv6 to maintain 
       dynamic group membership for fixed nodes (IGMP is used in IPv4 
       networks). The MLD is designed to limit group management messages in 
       local link and prevent the diffuse of group membership. This design 
       principle is beneficial to reduce the redundant information in 
       networks, but it is unable to provide the multicast management for 
       mobile nodes. If the MLD protocol is directly used in mobile 
       multicast services, it may cause a long multicast service disruption. 
       According to the MLDv1 specification, this disruption may be 67 
       seconds even without the link layer handover and IP layer handover 
       delay [7]. To improve the performance of mobile multicast, some 
       mobile multicast management protocol mechanism should be proposed to 
       manage the mobile subscribers.  

    2. Terminology 

       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
       document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

       The terminology used in this memo is already defined in MIPv6, FMIPv6, 
       HMIPv6 and NEMO.  

    3. Overview of the MLD Extension 

       The MLD protocol is a subset of ICMPv6 and the message types of MLDv1 
       and MLDv2 are 130, 131, 132 and 143. All MLD messages use the link-
       local address as the source address, and set the hop limit to be 1. 
       In order to force the IPv6 routers on that link to check MLD messages, 
       all MLD messages are encapsulated in hop-by-hop option with router 
       alert sub-option. MLD is an asymmetric protocol which consists of 
       router function and host function. The router function is used to 
       create the multicast state for subscribers ,and the record form is 
       {IPv6 group address, filter mode, source list}, while the host

    Internet-Draft        MLD Extension for MMCAST             August 2008 
        

       function is used by subscribers to send the join and leave messages, 
       and respond to periodic query messages.  

       The MLD extension is based on the traditional MLD protocol to provide 
       mobile multicast management for mobile nodes, and it is compatible 
       with the current MLD protocol. The MLD extensions consist of MLD host 
       function extension and MLD router function extension. And the 
       principle of extensions is to transmit the MLD messages to the 
       neighbouring subnets that the mobile subscribers may enter to create 
       the multicast status in advance.  

    4. MLD Extensions 

       The MLD extensions maintain the group membership for mobile nodes 
       based on the extended fields, and add new fields in the multicast 
       status to record the CoA and HoA information of mobile nodes. And the 
       extensions also introduce the multicast forwarding flag to control 
       the multicast packet transmission.  

    4.1. MLD Host Function Extension 

       MLD host function extension mainly modifies the MLD hop limit to 
       notify the neighbouring subnet to set up multicast status in advance. 
       And the MLD host function extension mainly extends the MLD report 
       message (message type are 131 and 143), and the MLD query message and 
       done message is similar to traditional MLD protocol.  

    4.1.1. The Extension of MLDv1 Report Message 

       Figure 1 shows the extension of MLDv1 report message. We use the code 
       field in ICMPv6 header to mark the extended MLD messages.

                  Figure 1 The Extension Of MLDv1 Report Message 

       Generally, the code field is used to create an additional level of 
       message granularity, and the additional messages depend on the type 
       of ICMPv6 message type. The MLDv1 report message is initialized to 
       zero by the sender and ignored by receivers.  

       We extend this field to carry the hops limit information. For example, 
       we can use the code field to record the predefined hops limit 
       directly. When code field is equal to 0, MLD messages use the link-
       local address as the source address, and perform the traditional MLD 
       function. When the code field is bigger than 1, the MLD messages use 
       the global unicast address as the source address, and use the value 
       in the code field to set the hop limit in IPv6 header.  

       Besides, we can also record the movement status of mobile node, and 
       set up the map between the movement status and hops limit to set the 
       hop limit. The detailed setting policy is beyond the scope of this 
       memo. 

    4.1.2. The Extension of MLDv2 Report Message 

       Figure 2 shows the extensions of MLDv2 report message. We extend the 
       reserved field of MLDv2 report message to indicate the type of MLD 
       message. Similar to the extended Code field in MLDv1 message, the 
       source address selection is also based on the reserved field. When 
       the reserved field is equal to 0, the message is traditional MLD 
       message, or else it is an extended MLD report message.

    4.1.3. MLD Message Encapsulation Format 

       Mobile node generates extended MLD report messages during the 
       movement. To provide the information for mobile multicast membership 
       management, the encapsulation of extended MLD messages differ from 
       the traditional MLD messages. Figure 3 shows the encapsulation format 
       of MLDv1/v2 messages. The extended MLD messages use the CoA as the 
       source address and set the hop limit based on the value in the 
       extended field. The following header is Hop-by-hop Option and the 
       value of IPv6 next header is 0x00. The Hop-by-hop Option uses the 
       router alert sub-option to force the router to check this message. 
       The next header field in Hop-by-hop Option is set to 0x3c which means 
       Destination Option with the Home Address Option to carry the home 
       address of mobile node. The last header is the ICMPv6 header which 
       carries the extended MLDv1/v2 messages.

                            identify and distinguish between different 
                            classes or priorities of IPv6 packets. 

       Flow Label           20-bit flow label. It may be used by a source to 
                            label sequences of packets for which it requests 
                            special handling by the IPv6 routers, such as 
                            non-default quality of service or "real-time" 
                            service.  

       Payload Length       16-bit unsigned integer. Record the length of 
                            the IPv6 payload.  

       Next Header          8-bit selector. Identifies the type of header 
                            immediately following the IPv6 header. To 
                            encapsulate the extended MLD message, the next 
                            header is the hop-by-hop option (0x00). 

       Hop Limit            8-bit unsigned integer. Decremented by 1 by each 
                            node that forwards the packet. The packet is 
                            discarded if Hop Limit is decremented to zero. 
                            In traditional MLD message, the hop limit is set 
                            to 1. But for the extended MLD message, the hop 
                            limit is based on the value in the extended 
                            field.  

       Source Address       128-bit address of the originator of the packet. 
                            For the traditional MLDv1/v2 message, the source 
                            address uses the link-local address. But for the 
                            extended MLD message, the source address 
                            selection is based on the value of extended 
                            field, (see section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2).  

       Destination Address  128-bit address of the intended recipient of the 
                            packet (possibly not the ultimate recipient, if 
                            a Routing header is present).  

       Next Header          8-bit selector. Identifies the type of header 
                            immediately following the Hop-by-Hop Options 
                            header. In the extended MLD message, the next 
                            header is Destination Option (0x3c) with carries 
                            the HAO option. 

       Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the Hop-by-Hop 
                            Options header in 8-octet units, not including 
                            the first 8 octets.

       Options              Variable-length field, of length such that the 
                            complete Hop-by-Hop Options header is an integer 
                            multiple of 8 octets long. Contains one or more 
                            TLV-encoded options. In the extended MLD 
                            messages, the Router Alert Option is used to 
                            focus the routers along the path to check the 
                            message.  

                            The first three bits of the first byte are zero 
                            and the value 5 in the remaining five bits is 
                            the Hop-by-Hop Option Type number. By zeroing 
                            all three, the nodes not recognizing this option 
                            type should skip over this option and continue 
                            processing the header. The next 8 bits record 
                            the length of the option. And the value in the 
                            next 2 octet code is set to 0 which means the in 
                            network byte order with the following the packet 
                            that contains a Multicast Listener Discovery 
                            messages.  

       Next Header          8-bit selector. The next header is the ICMPv6 
                            message and the value set to 0x3a. 

       Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the 
                            Destination Options header in 8-octet units, not 
                            including the first 8 octets.  

       Option Type          201 = 0xC9, the HAO sub-option.  

       Option Length        8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the option in 
                            octets excluding the Option Type and Option 
                            Length fields. This field MUST be set to 16. 

       Home Address         The home address of the mobile node sending the 
                            packet. This address MUST be a unicast routable 
                            address.  

    4.2. MLD Router Function Extension 

       The router function extension is to add the CoA and HoA fields in 
       multicast status. The extended record form is {IPv6 group address, 
       filter mode, source list, CoA, HoA, forwarding flag}. The source list 
       record format is {IPv6 source address, timers}. The CoA and HoA field 
       are used to record the multicast status for mobile node, and the 
       forwarding flag is used to indicate the multicast forwarding status. 
       When the forwarding flag is 1, the multicast router will forward the

    Internet-Draft        MLD Extension for MMCAST             August 2008 
        

       multicast packets, or else it will suppress the multicast packets 
       forwarding.  

    5. The Operation Flow of the Extended MLD Report Messages 

       Mobile node generates the extended MLD report messages when it moves 
       among the foreign networks, and it sends the extended MLD report 
       message to the MLD Querier in the attached link. The detailed 
       procedure is shown as following. 

       (1) Firstly, the MLD Querier checks the source address after 
       receiving the report message. The source address indicates the type 
       of MLD report message.  

       (2) If the source address is the link-local address, the MLD Querier  
       performs the traditional MLD message procedure. Or else it will 
       perform the extended MLD message procedure.  

       (3) And then the MLD Querier checks the sender of message based on 
       the source address. If the source address belongs to its direct 
       attached link, it will create/update the multicast status and set the 
       forwarding flag to 1. Or else, it only creates/updates the multicast 
       status with the forwarding flag set to 0. 

       (4) After that the MLD Querier checks the hop limit. If the hop limit 
       is 0, it will stop forwarding this message, or else it forwards this 
       message to the other attached links.  

       The MLD query message and MLD done message are similar to the 
       traditional MLD protocol. When the multicast status is near to expire, 
       the MLD Querier will advertise the MLD query message, and the MN 
       responds the MLD report message to update the multicast status. When 
       MN leaves the current access network, it sends MLD done message, and 
       the MLD Querier will reply the last listener query message after 
       receiving the done message.  

    6. Security Considerations 

       The security considerations are similar to the [3-4]. 

    7. IANA Considerations 

       This document defines the new extensions of MLDv1/MLDv2 Report 
       messages. The extensions need to assign the new Code values in MLDv1 
       report message and reserved field in MLDv2 report message.

    8. Conclusions 

       In this memo, we propose the extended MLD protocol to provide mobile 
       multicast membership management. The extended protocol extends the 
       forwarding range of MLD messages, and maintains the multicast status 
       for mobile nodes.
