    Information Model of Control-Plane and User-Plane separation BNG
              draft-wcg-i2rs-cu-separation-infor-model-02

Abstract

   To improve network resource utilization and reduce the operation
   expense, the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation conception is
   raised [I-D.gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture].  This document
   describes the information model for the interface between Control-
   Plane and User-Plane separation BNG.  This information model may
   involve both control channel interface and configuration channel
   interface.  The interface for control channel allows the Control-
   Plane to send several flow tables to the User-Plane, such as user's
   information table, user's interface table, and user's QoS table, etc.
   And it also allows the User-Plane to report the resources and
   statistics information to the Control-Plane.  The interface for
   configuration channel is in charge of the version negotiation of
   protocols between the Control-Plane and User-Plane, the configuration
   for devices of Control-Plane and User-Plane, and the reports of User-
   Plane's capabilities, etc.  The information model defined in this
   document enables defining a standardized data model.  Such a data
   model can be used to define an interface to the CU separation BNG.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid development of new services, such as 4K, IoT, etc, and
   increasing numbers of home broadband service users present some new
   challenges for BNGs such as:

      Low resource utilization: The traditional BNG acts as both a
      gateway for user access authentication and accounting and an IP
      network's Layer 3 edge.  The mutually affecting nature of the
      tightly coupled control plane and forwarding plane makes it
      difficult to achieve the maximum performance of either plane.

      Complex management and maintenance: Due to the large numbers of
      traditional BNGs, a network must have each device configured one
      at a time when deploying global service policies.  As the network
      expands and new services are introduced, this deployment mode will
      cease to be feasible as it is unable to manage services
      effectively and rectify faults rapidly.

      Slow service provisioning: The coupling of control plane and
      forwarding plane, in addition to a distributed network control
      mechanism, means that any new technology has to rely heavily on
      the existing network devices.

   To address these challenges, cloud-based BNG with CU separation
   conception is raised [I-D.gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture].  The main
   idea of Control-Plane and User-Plane separation method is to extract
   and centralize the user management functions of multiple BNG devices,
   forming an unified and centralized control plane (CP).  And the
   traditional router's Control Plane and Forwarding Plane are both
   preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user plane (UP).

   This document describes an information model for the interface
   between Control-Plane and User-Plane separation BNG.  This
   information model may involve both control channel interface and
   configuration channel interface.  The interface for control channel
   allows the Control-Plane to send several flow tables to the User-
   Plane, such as user's information table, user's interface table, and
   user's QoS table, etc.  And it also allows User-Plane to report the
   resources and statistics information to the Control-Plane.  The
   interface for configuration channel is in charge of the version
   negotiation of protocols between the Control-Plane and User-Plane,
   the configuration for the devices of Control-Plane and User-Plane,
   and the report of User-Plane's capabilities, etc.  The information
   model defined in this document enables defining a standardized data
   model.  Such a data model can be used to define an interface to the
   CU separation BNG.

2.  Concept and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   BNG: Broadband Network Gateway.  A broadband remote access server
   (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes traffic to and from broadband remote
   access devices such as digital subscriber line access multiplexers
   (DSLAM) on an Internet service provider's (ISP) network.  BRAS can
   also be referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).

   CP: Control Plane.  CP is a user control management component which
   supports the management of UP's resources such as the user entry and
   forwarding policy

   UP: User Plane.  UP is a network edge and user policy implementation
   component.  The traditional router's Control Plane and Forwarding
   Plane are both preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user plane.

3.  Control Plane and User Plane separation BNG Information Model
    Overview

   Briefly, a CU separation BNG is made up of a centralized CP and a set
   of UPs.  The CP is a user control management component which supports
   to manage UP's resources such as the user entry and forwarding
   policy, for example, the access bandwidth and priority management.
   And the UP is a network edge and user policy implementation
   component.  It can support the forwarding plane functions on
   traditional BNG devices, such as traffic forwarding, QoS, and traffic
   statistics collection, and it can also support the control plane
   functions on traditional BNG devices, such as routing, multicast,
   etc.

   The following figure describes the architecture of CU separation BNG

   The CU separated BNG is shown in above figure.  The BNG Control Plane
   could be virtualized and centralized, which provides significant
   benefits such as centralized session management, flexible address
   allocation, high scalability for subscriber management capacity, and
   cost-efficient redundancy, etc.  The functional components inside the
   BNG Service Control Plane can be implemented as VNFs and hosted in a
   NFVI.

   The User Plane Management module in the BNG control plane centrally
   manages the distributed BNG User Planes (e.g. load balancing), as
   well as the setup, deletion, maintenance of channels between Control

   Planes and User Planes.  Other modules in the BNG control plane, such
   as address management, AAA, and etc., are responsible for the
   connection with outside subsystems in order to fulfill the service.
   The routing control and forwarding Plane in the BNG User Plane
   (local) could be distributed across the infrastructure.

3.1.  Service Data Model Usage

   The idea of the information model is to propose a set of generic and
   abstract information models.  The models are intended to be used in
   both Control Plane and User Planes.  A typical scenario would be that
   this model can be used as a compendium for the interface between
   Control Plane and User Planes of CU separation BNG, that
   corresponding data model or TLVs can be defined to realize the
   communication between the Control Plane and User Planes.

   As shown in above figure, when users access to the BNG network, the
   control plane solicits these users' information (such as user's ID,
   user's MAC, user's access methods, for example via PPPoE/IPoE),
   associates them with available bandwidth which are reported by User
   planes, and based on the service's requirement to generate a set of
   tables, which may include user's information, user's IP address, and
   QoS, etc.  Then the control plane can transmit these tables to the
   User planes.  User planes receive these tables, parses it, matches
   these rules, and then performs corresponding actions.

4.  Information Model

   This section specifies the information model in Routing Backus-Naur
   Form [I-D.gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture].  This grammar intends to
   help readers better understand the English text description in order
   to derive a data model.  However it may not provide all the details
   provided by the English text.  When there is a lack of clarity in
   grammar the English text will take precedence.

   This section describes information model that represents the concept
   of the interface of CU separation BNG which is languages and
   protocols neutral.

4.1.  Information Model for Control-Plane

   This section describes information model for the Control-Plane (CP).
   As mentioned in section 3, the Control Plane is a user control
   management component which manages the user's information, User-
   Plane's resources and forwarding policy, etc.  The control plane can
   generate several tables which contain a set of rules based on the
   resources and specific requirements of user's service.  After that,
   the control plane sends the tables to User Planes, and User planes
   receive the tables, parse them, match the rules, and then perform
   corresponding actions.

   The Routing Backus-Naur Form grammar below illustrates the
   Information model for Control-Plane:

   base on UP's bandwidth resources and specific QoS requirements of
   user's services.  This table contains a set of QoS matching rules
   such as user's committed information rate, peak information rate,

   work under normal conditions.  This attribute is used to indicate the
   user's committed information rate, and it usually collaborates with
   other qos attributes (such as PIR, CBS, PBS, etc) to present the
   user's QoS profile.

   PIR: Peak Information Rate (PIR) is a burstable rate set on routers
   and/or switches that allows throughput overhead.  This attribute is
   used to indicate the user's peak information rate, and it usually
   collaborate with other QoS attributes (such as CIR, CBS, PBS, etc) to
   present the user's QoS profile.

   CBS: The Committed Burst Size (CBS) specifies the relative amount of
   reserved buffers for a specific ingress network's forwarding class
   queue or egress network's forwarding class queue.  This attribute is
   used to indicate the user's committed burst size, and it usually
   collaborates with other qos attributes (such as CIR, PIR, PBS, etc)

      o Rate-limit: used to rate-limit the class of service.  The value
      is expressed as a percentage of the global service bandwidth.

      o latency: used to define the latency constraint of the class.
      The latency constraint can be expressed as the lowest possible
      latency or a latency boundary expressed in milliseconds.

      o jitter: used to define the jitter constraint of the class.  The
      jitter constraint can be expressed as the lowest possible jitter
      or a jitter boundary expressed in microseconds.

      o bandwidth: used to define a guaranteed amount of bandwidth for
      the class of service.  It is expressed as a percentage.

4.1.2.  Interface Related Information

   This model contains the necessary information for the interface.  It
   is used to indicate which kind of service can be supported by this
   interface.  The Routing Backus-Naur Form grammar below illustrates
   the interface related information model:

4.1.2.1.  Interface Information Model

   The interface model mentioned here is a logical construct that
   identifies a specific process or a type of network service.  In CU
   separation BNG network, the Control-Plane (CP) generates the
   Interface-Infor table based on the available resources, which are
   received from the User-Plane (UP), and the specific requirements of
   user's services.

   The Routing Backus-Naur Form grammar below illustrates the interface
   information model:

                     <IPV6_TRIG><ND-TRIG>
                     <ARP_PROXY>


   IFINDEX: The IfIndex is the 32-bit index assigned to the interface by
   the device as specified by the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863].  The
   ifIndex can be utilized within a management domain to map to an
   actual interface, but it is also valuable in public applications.
   The ifIndex can be used as an opaque token to discern which interface
   of User-Plane is providing corresponding service for specific user.

   BAS_ENABLE: This is a flag, and if it is TRUE, the BRAS is enabled on
   this interface.

   PPP_Only: This is a flag, and if it is TRUE, the interface only
   supports PPP user.

   IPV4_TRIG: This is a flag, and if it is TRUE, the interface supports
   that the user can be triggered to connect the internet by using IPv4
   message.

   IPV6_TRIG: This is a flag, and if it is TRUE, the interface supports
   that the user can be triggered to connect the internet by using IPv6
   message.

   ND-TRIG: This is a flag, and if it is TRUE, the interface supports
   that the user can be triggered to connect the internet by using
   neighbor discovery message.

   ARP_PROXY: This is a flag, and if it is TRUE, the ARP PROXY is
   enabled on this interface.

4.1.3.  Device Related Information

   The device related information model presents the attributes which
   related to specific device.  For example the control plane can manage
   and distribute the users, who belong to same subnet, to some specific
   devices.  And then the user plane's devices can provide corresponding
   service for these users.  The Routing Backus-Naur Form grammar below
   illustrates the device related information model:

4.1.3.1.  Address field distribute Table

   In CU separation BNG information model, the Control-Plane (CP)
   generates and sends this Address field distribute table to UP.  Based
   on this table, the user-plane's devices can be divided into several
   blocks, and each block is in charge of working for users with the
   same subnet.  The Routing Backus-Naur Form grammar below illustrates
   the address field distribute information model:

   <address-field-distribute>::=<ADDRESS_SEGMENT><ADDRESS_SEGMENT_MASK>
                                <ADDRESS_SEGMENT_VRF><NEXT_HOP>

4.2.  Information Model for User Plane

   This section describes information model for the interface of User
   Plane (UP).  As mentioned in section 3, the UP is a network edge and
   user policy implementation component.  It supports: Forwarding plane
   functions on traditional BNG devices, including traffic forwarding,
   QoS, and traffic statistics collection and Control plane functions on
   traditional BNG devices, including routing, multicast, and MPLS.

   In CU separation BNG information model, the CP generates tables and
   provides the rules.  The UP plays two roles:

   1.  It receives these tables, parses it, and matches these rules,
       then performs corresponding actions.

   2.  It also generates several tables to report the available
       resources (such as usable interfaces, etc) and statistical
       information to CP.

   The Routing Backus-Naur Form grammar below illustrates the User Plane
   information model:

4.2.1.  Port Resources of UP

   The User Plane can generate the network resource table, which
   contains a bunch of attributes to present the available network
   resources, for example the usable interfaces.

   The Figure below illustrates the Port Resources Information Table of
   User-Plane:

   <port-resource-information>::<IF_INDEX><IF_NAME>
                                <IF_TYPE><LINK_TYPE>
                                <MAC_ADDRESS><IF_PHY_STATE>
                                <MTU>


   IFINDEX: IfIndex is the 32-bit index assigned to the interface by the
   device as specified by the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863].  The
   ifIndex can be utilized within a management domain to map to an
   actual interface, but it is also valuable in public applications.
   The ifIndex can be used as an opaque token to discern which interface
   of User-Plane is available.

   IF_NAME: the textual name of the interface.  The value of this object
   should be the name of the interface as assigned by the local device
   and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's
   `console'.  This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port
   number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the
   device.  If several entries in the ifTable together represent a
   single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same
   value of ifName.

   IF_TYPE: the type of interface, such as Ethernet, GE, Eth-Trunk, etc.

      4- Unknow: status cannot be determined for some reason;

      5- Dormant;

      6- Not present: some component is missing.

   MTU: This attribute specifies the available interface's MTU (Maximum
   Transmission Unit).

4.2.2.  Traffic Statistics Infor

   The user-plane also generates the traffic statistics table to report
   the current traffic statistics.

   The Figure below illustrates the Traffic Statistics Infor model of
   User-Plane:

   <traffic-statistics-information>::=<USER_ID><STATISTICS_TYPE>
                                      <INGRESS_STATIISTICS_PACKETS>
                                      <INGRESS STATISTICS_BYTES>
                                      <EGRESS_STATISTICS_PACKETS>
                                      <EGRESS_STATISTICS_BYTES>


   USER_ID: is the identifier of user.  This parameter is unique and
   mandatory.  This attribute is used to distinguish different users.
   And it collaborates with other statistics parameters such as ingress
   packets, egress packets, etc, to report the user's status profile.

   STATISTICS_TYPE: This attributes specifies the traffic type such as
   IPv4, IPv6, etc.

   INGRESS_STATIISTICS_PACKETS: This attribute specifies the Ingress
   Statistics Packets of specific user.

   INGRESS STATISTICS_BYTES: This attribute specifies the Ingress
   Statistics Bytes of specific user.

   EGRESS_STATISTICS_PACKETS: This attribute specifies the Egress
   Statistics Packets of specific user.

   EGRESS_STATISTICS_BYTES: This attribute specifies the Egress
   Statistics Bytes of specific user.
