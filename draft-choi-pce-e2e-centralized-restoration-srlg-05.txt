 Abstract


   This draft describes the concept of the Shared Link Risk Group 
   (SRLG) based logical ring configuration and recovery method using 
   ring SRLG for the purpose of PCE-based backup path computation.  
   In this restoration architecture, backup paths can be easily 
   established through the end-to-end path which follows from the 
   logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment of 
   backup path disjoint from the working path at all levels. To take 
   advantage of bandwidth considerations and fast restoration 
   mechanisms, a centralized Controller is used to provide 
   dedicated protection to Optical Transport Networks using the 
   SRLG concept.

   A robust and efficient signaling protocol, PCEMP, is used to 
   distribute the mapping table from the Controller (PCE node) to the 
   nodes in the optical transport network and for informing a failure 
   from a node to the corresponding Controller using PCEMP message
   exchanges. 

   This draft is in conjunction to explore the possibility of 
   explicitly including PCE-based backup path computation 
   within the scope of the PCE WG Charter

2. Introduction

   With the rapid growth of the Internet, the advance of wavelength 
   division multiplexing (WDM) technology, and the integration of 
   various communication technologies, the communication network is 
   evolving to include huge bandwidth-intensive network applications. 
   Survivability refers to the ability of the network to transfer the 
   interrupted service onto spare network capacity to circumvent a 
   point of failure in the network and it is a critical requirement 
   for IP over WDM networks. In a WDM network, a link failure, fiber 
   cut, node down may be due to human error or natural disasters 
   leading to the loss of large amount of data and multiple failures 
   of all the optical paths that traverse the fiber. So, we have to 
   develop appropriate recovery architecture and strategies that 
   minimize the data loss when a failure on a path occurs in WDM 
   based GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching) networks 
   that will offer fast recovery, with speeds comparable to SONET, 
   and versatile survivable functions.  
  
   Recovery techniques are broadly classified by computation timing 
   as pre-computed and dynamic and by their type of rerouting as 
   link-based, partial path-based and path-based. In dynamic 
   techniques, a search for backup path is initiated upon occurrence 
   of a failure. A backup path is computed based on availability of 
   resource at that time of failure. While dynamic techniques provide 
   better resource utilization, they suffer from long delays to search 
   and reroute the traffic on to the backup path and there is no 
   guarantee that the connection can be restored upon failure. Dynamic 
   techniques provide a best-effort type of service. In protection 
   techniques the primary and backup routes are computed and resources 
   are reserved for backup paths before the connection is established. 
   Upon occurrence of a failure the backup path is established and 
   traffic is immediately routed on to the backup path. A pre-computed 
   method avoids long delays in setting up backup paths upon failure. 
   The pre-computed techniques also provide guarantee that a connection 
   can be restored in the event of failure. According to range of 
   rerouting, the recovery techniques are classified into link-based, 
   segment-wised based and path-based recovery. Link-based techniques 
   reroute disrupted traffic around the failed link. This approach 
   requires the ability to identify a failed link at both ends. It 
   also makes recovery more difficult in the event of a node failure. 
   Furthermore, it limits the choice of backup path and thus may use 
   more capacity, while path-base techniques replace the whole path 
   between the two endpoints of a demand. The path-based techniques 
   have better resource utilization while span-based techniques have 
   better recovery time. Therefore, we focus on the path-based 
   recovery, called end-to-end recovery.

   Most backbone networks have a mesh physical topology. However, the 
   mesh-based schemes have some shortcomings. They are not as fast in 
   failure recovery as ring-based schemes and complicated working path 
   and backup path routing arrangements are used to achieve optimality, 
   and the optimization procedures used for mesh-based schemes are 
   very computationally intensive that are virtually impossible to 
   solve for very large networks. SONET networks are, for the most 
   part, protected in the form of rings. The rings are interconnected 
   in order to provide overall network connectivity and protection. It 
   is possible to design a fast and simple recovery strategy for ring 
   network so ring protection switching is well established and robust 
   in these days. Therefore, we need the ring concept in the mesh 
   optical network. 

   This draft describes the Ring configuration based on SRLG 
   information and the approach of using a centralized Controller that 
   enables fast restoration in optical transport networks. Using the 
   centralized Controller guarantees the establishment of a disjoint 
   end-to-end restoration path from failed working paths, and helps in 
   achieving near real-time end-to-end restoration in optical 
   transport networks.

   This forms the basis of including PCE-based backup path computation 
   within the scope of the PCE WG Charter.

    Generalized Multi-protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) enables service 
    providers to build networks with the flexibility of IP, the 
    reliability of SONET/SDH and the scalability of optics at costs 
    to offer services at extremely competitive prices. GMPLS supports 
    a concept of common control of packet, TDM, wavelength and fiber 
    services, and is a key enabler of the new network architecture 
    model. 
 
3.1 Introduction to the centralized Controller:

    This draft addresses the coordination of the IP and optical 
    network survivability based on a consolidated network element, 
    the controller and a truly integrated control plane. This 
    centralized Controller in the PCE node enables an integrated 
    network architecture where each network layer can freely exchange 
    topology and resource information. This allows network performance 
    to be globally optimized across all layers. In addition, a single 
    control plane and the central controller that manages all network 
    layers greatly simplify network management tasks.

   
    As far as control and management types are concerned, they can be 
    classified into three categories: centralized, distributed and 
    hybrid control/management. Each control and management type has 
    its' own advantages and disadvantages, but typical telecommunication 
    networks and automatic switched optical networks (ASON) defined 
    in ITU-T follows a centralized control/management architecture in 
    which the control plane is separate from the data plane. In this 
    draft, for path establishment and protection, we consider the 
    control plane to be separated logically from the data plane. 
    Separate Controllers or control/management networks comprising of a 
    series of Controllers could be connected to each other by through 
    signaling channels and appropriate control message exchanges. If 
    the domains of the control/management networks increase, a 
    hierarchical control/management structure could be applied. This 
    can be fully realized in the centralized Controller through logical 
    functional blocks. We do not restrict the interconnection 
    architecture of the optical transport networks such as overlay 
    model, peer model and augmented model. There is a channel 
    interface between the Controller and any node in the optical 
    transport network, and this can be realized using a number of 
    methods, like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), General 
    Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) etc. In this architecture, the 
    Controller is responsible for path calculation and recovery. Some 
    of the recovery functions are also assigned to nodes in the 
    optical network for the purpose of control and load balancing. 
    The Controller thus forms the building block of a PCE node for 
    the purpose of PCE based backup path computation.

3.2 Network Structure:

    In this draft, we develop the network architecture with a 
    hierarchical structure following the existing network management 



Choi, Guha                   Informational                    [Page 7]

Internet Draft 
draft-choi-pce-e2e-centralized-restoration-srlg-05.txt      March 2006


    architecture. We focus on the backbone part of networks where 
    link capacity is at least OC-48 (2.5 Gb/s). Each network node is 
    assumed to have OXC and IP router capabilities in the same 
    hardware setup, which results in the support of multiple traffic 
    types at the same location. The traffic manager in each optical 
    network node also manages multiple traffic types. Each node can 
    communicate directly with the centralized Controller to report 
    its status. As mentioned in Section 3.1, this could be achieved 
    via a network management standard, such as SNMP or GSMP. The 
    Controller takes care of network nodes within the same 
    administrative domain. It also has the responsibility of 
    centralizing domain network management service and integrating 
    the management of the transport network in its respective domain. 
    This structure permits scalability, as well as internetworking 
    of different administrative domains.


3.3 Control Structure:

    Network elements within each domain communicate with one another 
    via a common control plane. We assume a dedicated out-of-band 
    control channel between two adjacent nodes, and between each node 
    and the centralized Controller. The common control plane can be 
    implemented based on the GMPLS standard. The Resource Reservation 
    Protocol (RSVP) and Constraint-Based Routing Label Distribution 
    Protocol (CR-LDP) extensions to GMPLS can provide traffic 
    engineering in this unified network architecture. Moreover, 
    neighbor discovery and link state update can employ routing 
    protocol Link State Advertisements (LSA), such as the Intermediate 
    System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path 
    First (OSPF) extensions to GMPLS. 

3.4 Control Plane hierarchy architecture for SRLG Protection and 
    Recovery:

    In the integrated control plane proposed here, three levels of 
    functional control hierarchy are mapped into one centralized 
    Controller node and implemented as a single unit. The functional 
    blocks involved in the controller node are: the network processor 
    (the network management system with extended functionalities), the 
    domain processor (the network element management system with 
    extended functionalities), and the node processor. In the first 
    level, the network processor acts as an interface between users 
    and all sub-network domains. Its main functionality is to oversee 
    the provisioning of new connections across multiple sub-networks 
    and to maintain the network-wide topological view. The domain 
    processor supervises tasks within a sub-network domain, such as 
    service provisioning and network status monitoring. It handles 
    requests for connection setup and teardown, and computes 
    explicit paths that meet the SLA of each request. The network

Internet Draft

    monitor observes the overall network health and detects failure 
    and repair events. The databases maintained by the domain 
    processor include the domain topology, the domain link state 
    database gathered via the LSA protocol within its domain, and 
    the domain connection database which keeps track of all 
    established connections in the domain. The node processor 
    manages specific functionalities that can be done in a 
    distributed manner at each node, such as overload handling, 
    failure recovery, and status monitoring. It also detects sudden 
    link overloads, conducts a countermeasure and provides rapid 
    protection and restoration capability in times of failure. The 
    databases maintained by the node processor are the local link 
    state and the local connection databases. The local link state 
    is obtained automatically via the neighbor discovery protocol, 
    while the list of local connections is obtained from all 
    connections that traverse the node.

    The structure of the topology database may contain the combined 
    IP and optical layer topology in a unified form. The link state 
    database contains information not only about link connectivity, 
    but also about the shared-risk link group (SRLG) it belongs to, 
    the resources available on that link, the link protection type, 
    and the link status. This extra information is defined in the 
    LSA extensions to the GMPLS. 


4.  Logical ring configuration based on SRLG

    In this part, we describe some of the logical ring configuration 
    methods for optical networks and the functions of the centralized 
    Controller in providing real-time protection and recovery. 
    Ring-based schemes are essentially some extensions of self-healing 
    ring in the mesh topology, and the study of logical ring in mesh 
    network has been developed.   

4.1 Logical Ring with SRLG:

    Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) allow the definition of resources 
    or groups of resources that share the same risk of failure [6]. 
    The knowledge of SRLGs may be used to compute diverse paths that 
    can be used for protection in optical networks. The concept of 
    SRLG has been used to compute a path that is disjoint from a set 
    of links sharing the same risk. When two or more links share the 
    same risk, it may be the case that when a link fails, the others 
    fail at the same time. Proper planning needs to be done for the 
    network to recover from failures due to these risks. The risks 
    are generally represented by SRLGs. The SRLG concept generates 
    another dimension to the existing constraint-based path 
    computation methods traditionally used in hierarchical networks. 



Choi, Guha                  Informational                    [Page 9]

Internet Draft 
draft-choi-pce-e2e-centralized-restoration-srlg-05.txt     March 2006
      
    Existing logical ring architectures for recovery do not consider 
    the SRLG information for survivability of working paths and 
    backup paths and is generally configured based on topology 
    information and network characteristics. If the link from the 
    first ingress node is broken, the network cannot provide LSP SRLG 
    disjointness. This is a rather strong bottleneck to support 
    survivability of connections with different bandwidth 
    requirements and QoS constraints. The existing logical ring 
    configuration does not take account into the probability of 
    resource failure and risk of the link. Therefore, the disjoint 
    path may, in some cases, have some problems in being computed 
    and hence the probability of backup path failure increases 
    though the backup path may exist. We need to consider the 
    possibility of failure of the logical ring configuration at the 
    connection setup stage.  

    We propose the network architecture as the concept of the 
    logical ring with the SRLG for reliable transmission in 
    pre-configuration stage using the centralized Controller concept. 
    The proposed network with ring-SRLG is the set of SRLGs with 
    contribution weights per link to avoid backup path failure and 
    guarantee the survivability of traffic. The controller manages 
    the entire domain network, as discussed in Section 3.4. The 
    description follows a logical ring configuration with SRLG for 
    the purpose of restoration in mesh networks. In this architecture, 
    backup paths can be easily established end-to-end using the 
    logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment of a 
    backup path that is disjoint from a primary path that is set up. 
    The logical ring with ring-SRLG has both a primary path and a 
    backup path in same ring with one ring-SRLG. Ring-SRLG must 
    support two-way-connectivity, which supports the logical ring 
    architecture in OXC based mesh network and helps in protection 
    and recovery using the centralized Controller concept. Based on 
    a given SRLG table, which is configured at each node by the 
    centralized Controller, one can make rings between a source node 
    and a destination node and many intermediate nodes between the two. 

    To extend network scalability, a distributed domain management 
    system must be used, which is determined by the centralized 
    Controller. In order to configure the SRLG-based logical ring, a 
    control unit handling algorithm may be set up in the centralized 
    Controller which then configures the SRLG-based logical ring as 
    well as GMPLS signaling for LSP setups. Our restoration signaling 
    on the SRLG-based logical ring can allow dynamic network 
    configuration instead of static configuration by operators or 
    management systems. The use of signaling with SRLG via the 
    centralized Controller vastly reduces the complexity of network 
    configuration.

4.2 Segment wise logical ring using the centralized Controller:

    As a network becomes large, the possibility of the size of the
    ring pattern also became large. So, applying ring does not 
    promote efficiency in terms of end-to-end delay and recovery time. 
    In this section we propose the method, called segment-wised ring 
    [7] that can be effectively applied to real networks without 
    those problems. Additionally, it can support fast recovery and 
    can care for partially multiple simultaneous failures. 
        
    The main concept of segment-wised ring is to partition a large 
    network into several small networks to configure ring to each 
    small network. This is one of the major functionalities of the
    centralized Controller, which effectively partitions the 
    addressed domain using the three functional blocks, the Network 
    Processor, Domain Processor and Node Processor. Sub-networks are 
    chosen according to network provisioning such as physical layer 
    conditioning, call demands or QoS demands, which may arise from 
    the user. The following shows segment wise logical ring 
    architecture, with the centralized Controller managing the 
    different sub-networks:

    SRLG information during the primary path setup that it receives 
    from the centralized Controller. The network architecture with 
    the concept of logical ring with SRLG for reliable transmission 
    is established via pre-configuration.  

    To discuss about the survivability of logical topology, we 
    consider that the logical topology is redundant (two-connectivity); 
    the logical topology remains connected when a physical link goes 
    down. The ingress nodes should have the SRLG history and Ring-SRLG 
    combined with logical ring. This can be received from the 
    centralized Controller, as described in Section 3.2 and 3.4. The 
    controller can pre-compute the ring architecture before a failure 
    based on network topology information and SRLG contribution 
    weight factors and also configure the ring architecture after 
    failure by allocating resources via signaling for backup purposes. 
    This information is also conveyed to the individual ingress nodes 
    in the domain.
 
5.  Integrated Layer Survivability and Recovery Mechanisms:

    In this section we discuss of the integrated layer protection 
    mechanisms appropriate for the central Controller.

5.1 Protection and Recovery Mechanisms: 

    A request of LSP establishment from a client network is handled 
    by the Domain Processor of the centralized Controller, as 
    described in Section 3.4. This is mapped by the Controller to the 
    optical transport network and conveyed to the corresponding nodes. 
    When the Controller receives the request, it will try to compute 
    a logical ring encompassing the ingress and the egress node based 
    on the requested traffic parameters and the SRLG properties. 
    
    There can be two cases what the Controller can do, based on the 
    number of connection setup requests and the number of already 
    established connections in a domain. It can either distribute the 
    LSP mapping information to the participating nodes in the optical 
    transport domain and clear the domain link state database and
    domain connection database, or provide the mapping links to the 
    participating nodes. 

    i) Distribution of direct mapping information to nodes in the 
    optical network:

    In this method, the role of Controller is to find a logical ring, 
    to distribute the mapping table and SRLG information between a 
    primary path and a backup path to the nodes in the optical network, 
    and to trigger the establishment of a backup path once a failure 
    occurs. Each node is responsible for maintaining the mapping table 
    and establishment of primary and backup path by using signaling 
    messages. When a node detects a failure, it reports the failure to 
    its corresponding domain Controller. If an end-to-end path 
    protection is used, the Controller triggers the changeover from 
    the primary path to the backup path to the ingress nodes. If the 


Choi, Guha                   Informational                   [Page 12]

Internet Draft 
draft-choi-pce-e2e-centralized-restoration-srlg-05.txt      March 2006


    backup path is already established, the ingress node simply 
    changes the direction of the traffic flow from the primary path 
    to the backup path. However, if there is not an established backup 
    path, the ingress node tries to set up a backup path in the 
    network when it receives the trigger from the Controller. Since 
    the ingress node has been maintaining the route object for the 
    backup path received from the Controller, the path setup message 
    from the ingress node will propagate via a route that is disjoint 
    with the primary path. 

    ii) Distribution of mapping information link to nodes in the 
    optical network:

    In this method, the nodes in the optical transport network performs 
    failure detection and switching operation based on the pointers 
    provided by the forwarding table given by the corresponding domain 
    processor. The Controller performs the roles of finding a logical 
    ring as well as signaling to establish a primary and backup path. 
    When a failure is reported from a node in the optical network to 
    the corresponding Controller, the Controller should look up its' 
    internal table in the domain link state and domain connection 
    databases that maintains the backup path mapped to the failed 
    primary path. By using the Backup Route Object [7], the 
    Controller tries to establish the backup path. Once it is done, 
    the setup message of the backup path will be sent from the 
    Controller managing the ingress node domain to the Controller 
    managing the egress node domain. When the backup path is 
    established through the logical ring configuration, each 
    Controller on the path should send the forwarding table to the 
    corresponding node to configure its' forwarding databases. 


5.2 Protocol based Ring Recovery Mechanisms using the Controller in 
    the PCE node: 

    ITU-T G.otnpro.2 [9] provides protection switching by using 
    logical ring concept. However, it does not take account into the 
    probability of resource failure and risk of the link according to 
    a lack of true diverse fiber routes. We may need to consider the 
    possibility of failure of the logical ring configuration at the 
    connection setup stage. 

    The APS protocol (ITU-T G.otnpro.2) can be used between the 
    Controller and the optical network nodes in the ring topology. 
    It is ideal to overcome the bottleneck of the usual 50 ms 
    communications delay between Controller and nodes in the optical 
    transport network. 



Choi, Guha                   Informational                   [Page 13]

Internet Draft 
draft-choi-pce-e2e-centralized-restoration-srlg-05.txt      March 2006


    A robust and efficient signaling protocol should be used to 
    distribute the mapping table from the Controller to the nodes in 
    the optical transport network and for informing a failure from a 
    node to the corresponding Controller. Signaling for restoration 
    is also needed along the primary path and the backup path at the 
    time of connection setup. GMPLS mechanisms are similar to those 
    used for setting up primary paths and backup paths. In order to 
    support our mechanism, GSMP or APS may be extended or a totally 
    new protocol could be proposed. 

    PCEMP, suggested in [10] can be a suitable protocol 
    mechanism for this purpose. 


6.  Key features of PCEMP 

    This section summarizes the key features of the PCEMP protocol. 
    PCEMP is a generic domain routing and path computation protocol 
    that runs on any PCE unit that is capable of computing a path 
    based on an ordered graph. PCEMP uses data vector techniques for 
    path computation. Individual link state advertisements (LSAs) are 
    mapped onto the computation units directly at TE-LSP setup time. 
    Each PCE unit maintains this mapping information through the 
    controller unit and the mapping synchronization of the Link State 
    Databases (LSDBs) are performed using PCEMP finite state machines. 
    From this central controller sub-units, each PCE constructs a 
    routing table by calculating a shortest data vector tree, the 
    root being the calculating PCE node itself.

6.1 Other features of PCEMP

The other features of the PCEMP protocol are:

    1. Central Controller (CC). The central controller acts as the 
    originator of the network's local information environment. The 
    controller also acts in the global scenario of inter domain PCEs 
    and inter layer networks. It serves as the key functional point 
    of the data vector driven algorithm for all PCE information and 
    link state synchronizations by co-ordinating LSP advertisements 
    from other PCEs and LSRs (All PCE peers). 

    2. Soft PCE Controller (SPC). A Soft PCE Controller is an entity 
    designed primarily for protection and fast route establishment in 
    conjunction with the Central Controller. The SPC's primary 
    functionality is to provide a robust and real-time path 
    computation adjacency without crossover delays for the data driven 
    algorithm mechanism. Also, this enables the LSP state and path 
    computation state retention in case of nodal faults and hardware 
    failures.

Internet Draft 
draft-choi-pce-e2e-centralized-restoration-srlg-05.txt      March 2006

    3. Support for peer adjacency through non-participating interior 
    nodes. PCEMP treats these nodes opaquely and is able to maintain 
    the PCE adjacencies over inter-domains and inter-layer networks. 
    The protocol is generic and can be easily carried over existing 
    routing mechanisms over non-supporting network clouds. There is no 
    necessity for any additional configuration updates for PCEs 
    attached to such networks for initial discovery as the data driven 
    mechanism is flow based. 

    4. PCE domain areas (PCEDA). PCEMP allows the formation of 
    distinct PCE domain areas in a specific domain for end-to-end peer 
    participations. This is useful for several reasons. This is in line 
    with the protocol architecture that provides a granularity of data 
    protection within an autonomous system and isolation of data to 
    local branches of the tree. This is also helpful for the design of 
    the PCE units using soft memory techniques and reduces the 
    algorithm operation costs.

    5. Data driven mapping of external routing information. In PCEMP, 
    each external route is imported into the PCE domain area in 
    separate data driven computation strategies. This reduces the 
    amount of instantaneous re-computation of routing traffic data. 
    It also enables partial controller database updates when there is 
    a partial external route change. 

    6. Three level functional control hierarchy. PCEMP has a three 
    level controller hierarchy, intra-PCE-domain, inter-PCE-domain 
    and external-PCE-domain. This is discussed in the context of the 
    Centralized Controller. 

    7. Virtual link mapping. This is done via the real-time 
    configuration of logical local links based on the data-driven 
    strategy of the algorithm. The mechanism is thus made topology 
    independent and generic. 

    8. Soft Computation Memory (SCM). This is a novel feature in terms 
    of path computation in the CC and SPC. It helps split the tree 
    into a combination of sparse subtrees for fast computation. SCM 
    can be used to assign metrics of path computation as well as 
    compute data-driven flow based mappings in the PCE.
   
    9. Data-driven routing metric. In PCEMP, the computation metrics 
    are assigned to the outbound router interfaces and the soft 
    memory cycles in the PCE controller unit. The cost of a path is 
    then the weighted sum of the path's component interfaces and the 
    soft memory cycles. The routing and external path metrics can be 
    assigned externally. 

    10. Flow-based routing. Separate sets of paths can be computed for
    each type of service. This is done by assigning flow-based metrics 
    to each outgoing router interface.

6.2 Protocol level hierarchy architecture on the control plane 

    In an integrated control plane, three levels of functional control 
    hierarchy are mapped into one PCE node in the core of the Network 
    Processing engine and implemented as a single unit. PCEMP thus 
    has a three level controller hierarchy, intra-PCE-domain, 
    inter-PCE-domain and external-PCE-domain. 

    The functional blocks involved in the PCE node are: the network 
    processor (the network management system with extended 
    functionalities), the domain processor (the network element 
    management system with extended functionalities), and the node 
    processor. These are invoked by the PCEMP state machines and 
    comprise the fundamental protocol level hierarchies on the control 
    plane. In the first level, the network processor acts as an 
    interface between users and all sub-network domains. Its' main 
    functionality is to oversee the provisioning of new connections 
    across multiple sub-networks and to maintain the network-wide 
    topological view by reducing the computational domains to PCEDAs. 
    The domain processor supervises tasks within a sub-network 
    domain, such as service provisioning and network status 
    monitoring. It handles requests for connection setup and 
    teardown, and computes explicit paths that meet the SLA of each 
    request. The network monitor observes the overall network health
    and detects failure and repair events. The databases maintained 
    by the domain processor include the domain topology, the domain 
    link state database gathered via the LSA protocol within its 
    domain, and the domain connection database which keeps track of 
    all established connections in the domain. The node processor 
    manages specific functionalities that can be done in a distributed 
    manner at each node, such as overload handling, failure recovery, 
    and status monitoring. It also detects sudden link overloads, 
    conducts a countermeasure and provides rapid protection and 
    restoration capability in times of failure. The databases 
    maintained by the node processor are the local link state and the 
    local connection databases. The local link state is obtained 
    automatically via the neighbor discovery protocol, while the list 
    of local connections is obtained from all connections that 
    traverse the node. These are implemented using soft memory 
    concepts and synchronized using PCEMP. 

    For the purpose of establishing a guaranteed a disjoint backup 
    path and fast restoration techniques in the participating PCEDAs, 
    it is essential that the large scale data processing in the CC and 
    SPC have minimum overhead and processing delay. The CC manages the 
    entire domain network, as discussed before. In this architecture, 
    backup paths can be easily established end-to-end using the logical 
    configuration in the SPCs using PCEMP. Based on the data driven 
    routing metric table, which is configured at each PCE node by the 
    CC, one can make a robust real-time path between a source node and 
    a destination node and many intermediate nodes between the two.

    This is done using soft decision PCEMP algorithms [10].

6.3  Role of CC and SPC

    The CC is responsible for handling data vectors and synchronization 
    of different link states. The SPC acts a fast path computation 
    mechanism in case of crossover and faults. This conjunction makes 
    the PCE unit's functioning much more efficient. 

    This has the same implications as the LSA protocol used for peer
    advertisement and topology discovery. A significant improvement by
    using PCEMP is that the number of routers that can be attached 
    to a single PCEDA is quite arbitrary. As traffic increases, the SPC 
    eases the stringency of backup path computation and the CC-SPC 
    combination guarantees a disjoint alternate path calculation with 
    the minimum crossover time. 

    This follows from the previous section 6.2.

  For the Centralized Controller-OXC connection, we can use PCEMP 
  messaging for implementing SRLG based fast protection and restoration
  using PCE techniques. Here is a sample sequence of messaging that 
  helps in the Controller-OXC nodes maintain soft PCEMP status. 
  Details about the protocol messages can be found in [10]. 

  (1): Send a PCEMP Common Header with the COMPUTE_PATH enabled in the
       PCEMode field and the ACK REQUESTED enabled in the PCEFlag field. 
       The PCEMP message MAY include a PCE SUBOBJECT to inform the 
       responder (OXC) about the initiator's (Centralized Controller) 
       PCEMP-LOCAL-INITIATOR-ADDRESS. In this way the OXC is initialized
       with the soft-memory based computation for PCEMP FSMs. 

  (2): OXC receives this message and is configured with the soft-memory
       based path computation states. (If the OXC does not support this, 
       it may be needed to be configured administratively). It sends 
       back an ACK message with the responder's (OXC's)
       PCEMP-LOCAL-RESPONDER-ADDRESS

  (3): The Controller sends a PCEMP Common Header with the ESTABLISH_PATH 
       enabled in the PCEMode field and the Protection mode set in the 
       PCEStatus field of the Common Header. It also sends a PCEMP
       ESTABLISH message with the following parameters: 
       
       1. Flag field set to VARIABLE. The MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT is to be
          negotiated as discussed in [10]. In case this is not able to 
          be negotiated, then the PCEMP ERROR message SHOULD be 
          generated with the ERROR CODE field set to OUT OF TIME, and
          the Controller node MUST issue a fresh PCEMP ESTABLISH message 
          with the Flag field set to STATIC. 

       2. The SRLG and bandwidth support parameters are carried in the
          PCE SUBOBJECT. If this object is absent, a PCEMP ERROR 
          message MAY be generated, or the responder might wish to 
          choose a different granularity of protection. It MAY send a
          ESTABLISH message with the PCE SUBOBJECTs containing the 
          level of protection required, protection supported and
          bandwidth/SRLG conditions supported, upon whose receipt the
          Controller MAY issue a PCEMP TEARDOWN message to stop PCEMP
          message exchanges altogether. 

  (4): The OXC sends a PCEMP RESPOND message with the corresponding 
       PCE Descriptor ID and a Backup Path Computation ID in the PCE
       SUBOBJECT. This is matched and stored statically for the 
       lifetime of the path computation between the Controller-OXC 
       so that this ID remains static between them till the path 
       computation is over. If the PCE Descriptor ID changes value, 
       a PCEMP ERROR message MUST be generated with the ERROR CODE 
       field set to PROTOCOL ERROR with its own saved PCE Descriptor 
       ID of the wronged hop in the PCEMP NEGOTIATE OBJECT. It MUST 
       also set the Protection mode in the PCEStatus field of the 
       corresponding outgoing PCEMP Common Header.

  (5): The Centralized Controller issues a PCEMP TEARDOWN message 
       with the RequestType field set to CHANGE IN COMPUTATION STYLE 
       for the OXC to remain PCEMP enabled and the path computation 
       state active.

  (6): The OXC sends a PCEMP Common Header with the COMPUTE_PATH 
       enabled in the PCEMode field. The PCEMP message MAY include a 
       PCE SUBOBJECT to inform the responder (Centralized Controller) 
       about the initiator's (OXC's) PCEMP-LOCAL-INITIATOR-ADDRESS. 

6.5 Inter-domain point-to-multipoint considerations

    The protocol implementations are followed as in the previous section,
    except for a few modifications. 

    Before Step (3) as in 6.4, the Controller needs to send a PCEMP 
    Common Header with the COMPUTE_LSP_TYPE set in the PCEMode and the 
    Peer-to-peer mode set to 0 in the PCEStatus, as in [10]. A BANDWIDTH
    OBJECT MUST also be inserted in the corresponding PCEMP ESTABLISH
    message. The participating PCE peers thus get information that the 
    path computation session is a point-to-multipoint one. The paths may 
    even be aggregated for multipoint-to-multipoint TE LSP path 
    computation in inter-domains.

    In this mode of operation, Step (6) in 4.4 is replaced with the OXC
    (or OXCn, in the more general case) sending a PCEMP Common Header 
    with the COMPUTE_LSP_TYPE enabled in the PCEMode field and the
    peer-to-peer mode set to 0 in the PCEStatus. A BANDWIDTH OBJECT MUST
    also be added, as discussed in [10]. The BANDWIDTH OBJECT SHOULD be
    retained across inter-domains LSPs.


7.  Conclusion

    Network survivability is a critical requirement in high-speed 
    networks. So, recovery mechanisms that can provide fast recovery 
    and efficient capacity are needed. Our proposed network 
    architecture using the centralized Controller considered high 
    survivability of backup path, called ring-SRLG that has grouped 
    traffic driven logical rings and shared resources in GMPLS based 
    networks. Ring-SRLG with the centralized Controller can guarantee 
    the survivability of backup paths with constraints to the other 
    logical ring configuration. Our proposed backup paths can be 
    easily established through the end-to-end path, which follows the 
    logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment of 
    backup path disjoint from the working path. 

    We have shown that our proposed integrated provisioning, which 
    combines protection efforts from both IP and optical layers, is 
    favorable over the traditional provisioning approach. The 
    integrated protection effort achieves efficient resource 
    allocation in terms of total bandwidth reservation, bandwidth

    utilization, and connection blocking probability. The level of 
    improvement largely depends on the type of pre-configured 
    underlying lightpath protection. While we expect that the choice 
    of lightpath protection should depend on the nature of service 
    requests, we leave it up to the service provider to make this 
    choice. The scheme takes advantage of information sharing across 
    network layers which is facilitated by GMPLS. The proposed scheme 
    uses GMPLS capabilities to provide end-to-end survivability 
    against network failures. This integrated provisioning scheme can 
    deliver rapid service provisioning dynamically on demand. The
    consolidated effort simplifies the provisioning process and 
    reduces network management complexity by eliminating the 
    cumbersome coordination of provisioning in separate network layers. 

    PCEMP along with the PCE framework can be an efficent mechanism
    for this purpose of fast backup path computation.

8. Security Considerations

    The impact of the use of the PCEMP architecture is relatively 
    much secure as the PCEDA are computed and distributed internal to 
    the PCE unit. An increase in inter-domain information flows and 
    the facilitation of inter-domain path establishment through PCEMP 
    does not increase the existing vulnerability to security attacks. 
    It should be remembered that PCEMP works by an invoked logic 
    scheme local to each participating PCE unit, and the protocol 
    invoke is brought into play only when there is a significant 
    change in the data profile within the time of goodness of fit.

    However, it is expected that the PCE solutions will address 
    security issues mentioned in [Ash] in details using authentication 
    and security techniques.
