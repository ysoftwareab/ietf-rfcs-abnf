Abstract

   This document describes a use case involving session peering in
   Service Provider Federations.  The scenario is based on the
   deployment experience gleaned from one such active federation.  The
   focus in this document is on SIP layer interactions and supporting
   protocols commonly used in Federation based Layer 5 peering.

1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to highlight some of the actual
   peering models that are in practical use (commercial or other) today.
   This document should not be seen as a set of requirements for what
   peering should or should not be; rather, it is a statement of how
   voice-service provider peering is occurring in the IP world today.
   It is descriptive, not prescriptive.  This document starts with a
   conceptual framework for understanding peering models.  This
   framework is then mapped into the three identified peering model
   categories described in the SPEERMINT terminology draft [9].
   Finally, a use case containing elements of all models and closely
   modeling an actual peering instance is presented.


2.  Terminology

   Terminology in this document follows the conventions listed in [9]
   with the following additions:

      OU: Originating User - User Agent making the call

      O-VSP: Originating Voice Service Provider - VSP providing voice
      services to OU

      TU: Terminating User - User Agent receiving the call

      T-VSP: Terminating Voice Service Provider - VSP providing voice
      services to TU

      PSP: Peering Service Provider - A logical entity providing 1 or
      more of the 5 peering functions described in the next section

      D-PSP: PSP providing location function or service enabling direct
      (D) peering [9]relationship

      I-PSP: PSP providing peering functions on behalf of a VSP enabling
      indirect (I) peering [9].  Can include all peering functions or
      services other than location service

      A-PSP: PSP providing all peering functions on behalf of VSP
      enabling Assisted (A) peering [9].  As opposed to the prior two
      PSP types, access to A-PSP is restricted to VSPs sharing the same
      federation as defined in [9]

3.  Conceptual Model

   A set of functional building blocks is defined for modeling peering.
   All models discussed in this document are analyzed with respect to
   six functions or services associated with the call setup across
   peering networks.  Each of these functions presented below has an
   orthogonal layer of policy associated with it that defines the
   implementation of the function.  The functions are:

      L (Location) Location of termination Voice Service Provider

      I (Interoperability) Signaling/media compatibility with T-VSP

      S (Security) Security of transport, authenticity of O-VSP/T-VSP

      T (Trust) Privacy, Identity [6], Authentication management, SPIT

      R (Routing) Priority based traffic management

      C (Cost) Cost of call

   Each of these peering functions should have a policy framework
   associated with it consisting of the actual content (e.g.  TLS vs.
   IPSec), negotiation and enforcement.  Policy can be negotiated via
   anything from a simple fax to a dynamic, real- time policy exchange
   engine.  Such negotiation is outside the scope of this document.  As
   for policy content, the bullets below give some examples:

      Location Function Policy Content:

         o Query mechanism and format of data (NAPTR [1] , SIP 3XX [2])

         o Location of authoritative information (Remote, Local)

         o Type of data returned (Domain, IP)

            if domain - resolution of domain (static, DNS SRV [3])

         o Whose location returned (T-VSP, Intermediary)

         o O-VSP has access to (All data, Selected peers)

         o Data retrieval (Unlimited, Rate limited)

Internet-Draft             Speermint Use Cases              October 2006


      Interoperability Function Policy Content:

         o Supported RFCs

         o DTMF mechanism [5]

         o B2BUA Vs Proxy [2]

         o Supported codecs[4]

         o Transcoding function



      Security Function Policy Content:

         o Type (IPSec, TLS)

         o Symmetric (IPSec IKE, mutual TLS)

         o Asymmetric (TLS + Digest)



      Trust Function Policy Content:

         o Peering relationship

            Privacy (signaling, media, location)

            Identity (Authentication server)

            Authentication (OU, O-VSP)

         o Per call

            SPIT (queries/sec, sequential requests, blacklists etc)



      Routing Function Policy Content:

         o Priority based limiting

            Concurrent calls






Schwartz, et al.         Expires April 27, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             Speermint Use Cases              October 2006


            Call starts / sec

            Congestion



      Cost Function Policy Content:

         o Gratis/Fee

         o Type of charge (per query, per call, per minute)

         o Prepaid/Postpaid

         o Currency



   Please note that the content just described can exist at a number of
   overlapping logical entities including:

      o At a PSP

      o At a PSP, for a given Federation entity

      o Static between specific peers O-VSP and T-VSP

      o On a call by call basis between the peers


4.  Scope

   This document does not address the following issues relating to the
   use cases:

      o Provisioning of information by the VSPs to location servers

         (e.g.  Zone transfers, EPP, etc.)

      o Negotiation of Policy

      o Financial/business Motivations

      o Issues discussed extensively in other documents including:

         ENUM NAPTR query [1]

         SIP redirect mechanism

         SRV "decoding" query [3]

         Trust or security mechanisms [7],[8]


5.  Peering Service Providers (PSPs)

   PSPs as defined as follows:

      A PSP is a logical network entity providing one or more of the six
      peering functions described above.  It may be co-located at one or
      both of the peered VSPs, or it may be a separate, independent
      entity.

   The following matrix presents the functionality associated with each
   PSP type

                         |   D-PSP   |   I-PSP   |   A-PSP   |

   PSPs will be represented in the diagrams as circles containing the
   relevant functional elements.  As noted above in the terminology
   section, access to PSP functionality may be limited to members of a
   federation.  In this document membership in a federation will be
   denoted with the word "member" associated with a link to a PSP.


6.  High-Level Peering Models

   The three models described below are defined in the SPEERMINT
   terminology draft [9].  These models are reviewed here in the context
   of our conceptual framework.  Short examples are provided for the

   sake of completeness and clarity.

6.1.  Bi-Lateral or direct peering

   The figure below depicts a typical Bi-Lateral or direct peering
   relationship.  While there may not be a need for a location service
   to provide remote lookup (i.e. in the case where all T-VSP user
   information is known by O-VSP) this is usually not the case.  More
   often than not, the T-VSP user list is not known remotely and there
   is a need for T-VSP to be queried via either SIP redirect mechanism
   or ENUM to attain the required information.  For the purposes of this
   document, VSPs upload their numbers to an externally reachable
   location service denoted as D-PSP.  While in almost all cases of Bi-
   lateral relationships both O-VSP and T-VSP share a D-PSP (and could
   technically be considered members of this D-PSP "federation" - as
   shown in the figure below), depending on D-PSP policy, O-VSP may not
   need to be a member (e.g. share any of his own user base) in order to
   retrieve information about other members serviced by this D-PSP.

   Figure 2: Direct peering example

   The flow in this figure is as follows:





Schwartz, et al.         Expires April 27, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             Speermint Use Cases              October 2006


      (1) OU sends signaling request containing TU username to O-VSP.
      Note the (T) depicting the need for trust between OU and O-VDP.
      As mentioned above, there are two popular protocols in use for
      purposes of querying the location service (2), namely ENUM and SIP
      INVITE (resulting in 3XX redirect message).  In either case the
      resulting call routing data (CRD) [9] containing next hop routing
      information for this particular call is in the form "sip:TU@
      T-VSP".  This next hop domain name resolution service provided by
      D-PSP is denoted by the (L) enclosed in the D-PSP.

      Once the next hop domain is retrieved there is a need for
      resolution into a routable address.  This is performed by O-VSP
      (hence the (L) in the O-VSP) and can be done either statically
      based on preconfigured values or dynamically via DNS SRV.  In
      either case, the call is then routed to T-VSP (3) over a secure
      channel and finally onto TU (4).  Note that both O-VSP and T-VSP
      contain the interoperability function (I) as in most cases the
      Session Border Controller (SBCs) in each is responsible for this
      functionality.  Note also that the link connecting the two VSPs
      has both (S) and (T) denoting the need for both transport layer
      security (S) and trust (T) in the form of Authenticated Identity.
      Finally, note the cost functions (C) located both at D-PSP and at
      T-VSP indicating possible charges associated with traffic (query
      or signaling) arriving at these entity.

6.2.  Assisted peering

   As described in the speerming-terminology draft, assisted peering
   involves the deployment by the federation of centralized SIP
   elements.  These elements provide SIP proxy functionality, and are
   often implemented in practice by Session Border Controllers (SBCs),
   which may "filter" "normalize" and provide network-hiding for
   incoming messages en route to their final destination.  Fear and
   distrust coupled with continued interoperability and security
   concerns have revived the need for the neutral central element role
   enabled by this peering model.

   The figure below depicts a simplified assisted peering scenario
   containing two VSPs in an A-PSP assisted peering (A.K.A spoke and
   hub) federation.  Note that as opposed to the case of the D-PSP
   federation where "membership" of the querying party is optional, in
   this model it is mandatory.

        /____\                      /____\

   Figure 3: Assisted peering example

   The flow being presented in this figure is one where end user OU is
   trying to call end user TU with both end users receiving services
   from different VSPs belonging to an assisted peering federation.  The
   flow is as follows:

      (1) OU sends a signaling request containing the TU username to
      O-VSP.  O-VSP cannot resolve the TU on its own, and in order to
      determine the reachability of TU, must send a location query (2)
      to the federation (note the (L) function in A-PSP).  Since this is
      an assisted peering federation, the response is in the form TU@
      A-PSP signifying that the signaling needs to traverse the A-PSP.
      Once the A-PSP domain is retrieved there is a need for translation
      into a routable address.  This can be done statically (hence the
      (L) in the O-VSP) or dynamically via DNS SRV.  In either case, the
      call is then routed to the A-PSP (3) over a secure channel. (note
      that step 2 can be eliminated by sending signaling directly to
      A-PSP).

      The reason for the popularity of this model can be attributed to
      the concentration of functions provided by A-PSP.  As an external
      element, A-PSP can provide the full set of services for VSPs, and



Schwartz, et al.         Expires April 27, 2007                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             Speermint Use Cases              October 2006


      through its own relationships with the VSP, eliminate the need of
      all VSPs for pair-wise trust and service relationships.  A-PSP can
      potentially encompass a large namespace of users that is
      accessible in one query (L) to external VSP members (or not -
      depending on policy).  In addition there is an interoperability
      function (I) usually performed by a SIP Proxy, almost guaranteeing
      interoperability and protocol interchangeability between member
      VSPs.  As part of the interoperability there is also is media sub-
      function enabling the federation to enforce a standard set of
      codecs or alternatively provide transcoding functionality to make
      sure there is media interoperability as well.  Finally, A-PSP can
      implement the routing function (R) enabling traffic shaping and
      throttling across the federation.

      In this flow A-PSP looks up the next hop for this call, receives
      an answer of the form sip:TU@T-VSP and translates to a routable
      next hop using either statically configured information or
      dynamically using DNS SRV.  Next, A-PSP runs through additional
      logic before deciding if call can be routed to its destination.
      If no rules prevent the completion of the call it is then routed
      (4) to T-VSP and finally to TU (5).  Here too note the possible
      cost function associated with A-PSP.

6.3.  Indirect peering

   The "Indirect" model defines a peering relationship that utilizes
   transient peering networks or VSPs that assist in connecting the OU
   to the TU.  It is hard to implement this model without the additional
   use of one of the other models as the relationship of the O-VSP with
   the I-PSP will be either direct or assisted.  For the sake of
   simplicity, this section will discuss a relatively simple model and
   leave a more complicated one for the next section.  A simplistic
   model appears in the figure below.  Note that in this figure O-VSP is
   not a "member" of the same D-PSP as T-VSP.  For this reason he is not
   granted direct access to T-VSP.  Instead, the query (2) yields the
   address of an intermediary I-PSP that T-VSP does have a relationship
   with.  In this scenario I-PSP and T-VSP are both "members" of a
   D-PSP.

   Figure 4: Indirect peering example

   The flow in this scenario is as follows:

      (1) OU sends signaling request containing TU username to O-VSP.
      O-VSP does not know who the user is and decides to query (2) D-PSP
      (which may be a public or private ENUM tree) about TU.  Since
      T-VSP does not know or trust O-VSP, T-VSP does not want to accept
      any traffic directly from O-VSP and wants I-PSP to process call
      first to make sure it will not cause any trouble to T-VSP.  T-VSP
      thus registers TU as belonging to I-PSP so that response to query
      in (2) is in the form sip:TU@I-PSP.  O-VSP sends (3) the request
      to I-PSP.  Note that there may be no trust relationship (T) or
      security relationship (S) between the two VSPs.  Depending on
      policy at I-PSP this lack of security may cause call to be
      rejected.  I-PSP has many peering functions available to it and
      after finding out where to route the call (4) and decoding the
      next hop domain information I-PSP can enforce policy for T-VSP
      prior to sending off to T-VSP (5) for its final destination (6).
      Note cost functions (C).

7.  Use case combining different peering models

   Actual real world peering models often contain more complexities than
   can be described by the individual models described above.  However,
   by combining and composing these models, a more faithful
   representation can be found.

   Consider a case where T-VSP has the flowing three relationships with
   other VSPs.  The first relationship is an open one whereby T-VSP
   accepts traffic from anyone.  The second relationship is as a member
   of a closed federation or premier club providing a higher class of
   service to all its members.  In this federation there are no
   business, trust or technical issues preventing peering amongst
   members as the strict membership requirements reduce these risks for
   all members.  The third relationship consists of premier type peers
   who are technically incapable of peering with all other members of
   the premier federation.  They may have protocol or codec issues
   denying them equal access to all members of the premier federation.
   The three relationships shall be denoted for the sake of this example
   OPEN, PREM and R-PREM.  Incoming traffic from OPEN is accepted
   providing the following conditions are met:

      Complete anonymity of termination routing information is preserved
      preventing possibility of direct outside contact and bypassing of
      policy

      Filtering of message for malicious content is performed prior to
      acceptance of call by T-VSP

      Calls suspected as SPIT messages are flagged or blocked before
      acceptance

      Dynamic throttling of outside traffic is available to give higher
      priority to premier traffic

   The scenario described above is presented in the figure below

   Figure 5: Hybrid peeering example

   As can be seen in the figure above, the open provider OPEN must
   traverse an assisted peering federation A-PSP before being allowed to
   reach T-VSP.  The premier peer PREM shares a D-PSP with T-VSP and as
   this relationship is just a Bi-Lateral one there is no need for
   intermediaries.  The reduced premier provider R-PREM shares both a
   D-PSP and an I-PSP with T-VSP.  As opposed to the OPEN that requires
   a full blown A-PSP, since the R-PREM does not require anonymity, the
   I-PSP is enough to bridge the technical divide.


8.  Comparison of Models

   In real world peering deployments, VSPs are players and stakeholders
   in the global VoIP space.  As such, peering entities must consider
   financial and technical tradeoffs between the different models.
   Financial tradeoffs include capital and operational expenses
   associated with each model and technical tradeoffs include
   scalability and reliability of each model.  Future versions of this
   document will present these tradeoffs in a detailed fashion.


9.  Security Considerations

   All Security considerations related to the SIP protocol are also
   applicable in peering relationships.
