Internet-Draft             The WIDEX Framework                 June 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the components and interactions between them
   of the Widex framework used to support XML-based user interfaces,
   where the user interface and application logic may be on different
   machines, and coupled via an exchange of XML DOM events and update
   operations.  The framework described in this document is intended to
   fulfil the requirements described in Internet-Draft Widex
   Requirements [I-D.ietf-widex-requirements].


2.  Architecture Paradigm

   The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern (MVC) [MVC] divides
   an interactive application into three components.  The model contains
   the core functionality and data.  Views display information to the
   user.  Controllers handle user input.  Views and controllers together
   comprise the user interface.  A change-propagation mechanism ensures
   consistency between the user interface and the model.

   Figure 1 describes an extension to the MVC architecture which enables
   the situations where the user interface and the model may be on
   different machines.

      Figure 1: Architecture paradigm - A networked MVC architecture

   In the networked MVC architecture, the View is exported on the remote
   device while a Virtual View is maintained on the server.  The change-
   propagation mechanism that ensures consistency between the user
   interface and the model is augmented with methods which keep the View
   synchronised with the Virtual View, synchronisation being done via
   updates.  Additionally, user interactions or gestures are captured by
   the View copy and passed to the Controller as events.

   It is quite common that the View is not needed in the Widex Server,
   but there are situations (e.g. desktop applications) in which the
   Widex Server has to maintain a real copy of the View.  Therefore, we
   call the View in the Widex Server to be Virtual.


3.  The Widex Framework Definition

3.1.  Overview

   In the context of Widex working group, the user interface is
   understood as XML [XML1.0] data describing the user interface.
   Typically, the XML data is manipulated as levels 2 and 3 in the W3C
   Document Object Model (DOM), see [DOM2.Core], [DOM3.Core], and
   [DOM2.Events] (W3C has yet to complete work on DOM3 events).  Style
   information associated with the user interface can be manipulated via
   the DOM, see [DOM2.Style].

   The Widex Framework, described in Figure 2, is based on the networked
   MVC paradigm described in Section 2.  The Widex framework is handling
   all network related issues involved in the networked MVC
   architecture, e.g. discovery and matching of Widex Elements, setting
   up sessions between Widex Elements, marshaling XML DOM updates or
   events and exchanging them over the wire.

   There are many events emitted on the Widex Renderer side that have no
   meaning for the application running in the Widex Server and in order
   to minimise the network traffic the Widex Framework MUST deliver only
   the information having remote scope.

                    Figure 2: Widex Framework Overview

   The Widex Framework needs a mechanism by which the Widex Renderer
   determines which events have a remote scope and therefore need to be
   serialized and forwarded to the Widex Server.  The determination of
   which events have a remote scope could be achieved in one of three
   ways:

   o  prior agreement between the Widex Renderer and Widex Server
   o  a list of events passed during session establishment
   o  the Widex Server could direct the Widex Renderer to add and remove
      event listeners during the session

   The Widex Framework enables remote event listeners to be dynamically
   attached to DOM nodes during the session using WO.Selector messages
   as described in Section 4.3.  Local event listeners that are not
   forwarded to the Widex Server may be dynamically attached through
   WO.Update messages as described in Section 4.1, and which update the
   DOM tree that is interpreted by the Widex Renderer.

   With the Model-View-Controller design pattern, updates to the
   (virtual) DOM tree held by the Widex Server are reflected as
   WO.Update messages that in turn result in the Widex Renderer updating
   its copy of the DOM tree to match the changes made by the Widex
   Server.  A similar process occurs when the Widex Server adds or



Stirbu & Raggett        Expires December 21, 2006               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             The WIDEX Framework                 June 2006


   removes event listeners, where these changes are mediated by
   WO.Selector messages.

   With the DOM Event model it is possible to attach multiple event
   listeners for the same event.  The DOM event model defines an
   ordering in which the listeners are invoked, and provides a means to
   stop further propagation of the event, and to prevent the default
   event handler from being invoked.  In the case of a mix of local and
   remote event listeners, depending on where they are attached, a local
   event listener could stop further propagation and thereby prevent the
   remote event listener from being invoked.  The other way around is
   more complicated.  The stub used by the Widex Renderer for remote
   event listeners could itself stop further propagation, but there
   would be undue latency incurred if this was to be done by the
   corresponding event handler in the Widex Server.

   In an implementation where the Widex Server maintains an explicit XML
   DOM for the View, changes made by the Widex Server to this View
   result in DOM events, e.g.  DOM Mutation events.  The Widex Framework
   in the server (as shown in Figure 1) can listen for these events to
   generate the corresponding Widex messages.  The Widex Framework in
   the Renderer interprets these messages to reflect the changes to its
   copy of the XML DOM for the View.  Note that the Widex messages are
   independent of whether the Widex Server maintains an explicit DOM for
   the View, that is, an in-memory XML DOM tree, as this is an
   implementation dependent design choice.

3.2.  Components

   The Widex Framework has three components:

   o  Service Discovery and Session Setup
   o  Widex Sync
   o  Transport

                +-----------+   +--------------------------+

                   Figure 3: Widex Framework Components

3.2.1.  Service Discovery and Session Setup

   The Service Discovery and Session Setup component is treated by the
   Widex Framework as a black box; any service discovery mechanism being
   able to find matches between a Widex Server and a Widex Renderer and
   any session setup mechanism able to establish a session between a
   matching Widex Server and Widex Renderer can be used as part of the
   framework.

   We define a match or compatibility between a Widex Server and Widex
   Renderer when the Widex Renderer can display the user interface
   exported by the Widex Server.  Typically this means that both devices
   support the same XML DOM and XML DOM Events specifications and the
   Widex Renderer has rendering capabilities for the XML user interface
   language exported by the server.

   Quite often, the Widex Server can make better decisions on what user
   interface to export to a particular Widex Renderer if it has
   additional information about its hardware capabilities, e.g. screen
   size, color depth, input methods.

   Therefore, the Service Discovery mechanism MUST negotiate the
   following capabilities:

   o  supported XML DOM level,
   o  supported XML DOM Events level,
   o  supported XML user interface description language,
   o  supported transport mechanism.

   The Service Discovery mechanism SHOULD negotiate the following
   capabilities for the Widex Renderer:

   o  event listeners
   o  device configuration

   where examples of the device configuration includes the display

Internet-Draft             The WIDEX Framework                 June 2006


   resolution, the color depth, and input methods.

   The Session Setup mechanism MUST be able to initiate the Widex
   Session between the Widex Server and the Widex Renderer using the
   selected transport mechanism.

3.2.2.  Widex Synchronisation

   The Widex Sync component provides the functionality that enables the
   marshaling of XML DOM updates and events.  Additionally, the Widex
   Sync component provides the control messages that determine which
   events have remote scope.

3.2.3.  Transport

   The Transport component is treated by the Widex Framework as a black
   box; any transport mechanism being able to facilitate the exchange of
   Widex Sync messages between a Widex Server and a Widex Renderer can
   be used as part of the framework.

   The Transport mechanisms MUST deliver the Widex Sync messages as
   string of bits between the Widex Server and the Widex Renderer in a
   timely, reliable and in sequence manner.


4.  Widex Synchronisation Messages

4.1.  WO.Update Message

   The WO.Update messages contain description of changes to XML DOM
   trees.  The updates can target individual nodes in order to update
   their properties and attributes, or can target parts of the DOM tree
   in order to change its structure, e.g. add/delete/replace nodes or
   branches.

   Typically, a Widex Servers can trigger WO.Update messages that
   produce the full range of mutations while Widex Renderers trigger
   WO.Update messages that target individual nodes to update their
   properties and attributes.

   WO.Update messages MUST be encoded using formats defined by REX
   [W3C.WD-rex-20060202].

4.2.  WO.Event Message

   The WO.Event messages are primarily used to carry events triggered on
   the Widex Renderer side so that they can be caught by the application
   logic event handlers on the Widex Server side.  A secondary use of

Internet-Draft             The WIDEX Framework                 June 2006


   WO.Event messages is where the application logic itself raises events
   that may be caught by event handlers associated with the remote user
   interface.

   Note: Some UI markup languages, e.g.  Glade [1], do not have events
   defined at document level and therefore WO.Event messages MUST be
   able to serialize the events emitted by the associated libraries,
   e.g.  GTK+ [2].

4.3.  WO.Selector Message

   The WO.Selector message MUST contain sufficient information to enable
   the Widex Renderer to add or remove remote event listeners associated
   with particular nodes in the XML DOM.


5.  Processing External Resources

5.1.  References to External Resources

   User interface markup languages may contain references to external
   resources such as images and streaming audio/visual media.  The means
   by which the Widex Renderer accesses these resources is out of scope
   for the Widex Framework.

5.2.  Synchronising with External Resources

   WO.Update messages may including timing information for when they
   should be applied.  In some cases, this will involve synchronising to
   streaming media, for instance, when WO.Update is used to update a
   user interface described in SVG, where the updates need to be
   synchronized with an associated audio stream.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   The Widex Framework provides no security facilities (e.g.
   authentication or privacy ) of its own.  It relies on the framework
   components for all of these abilities.

Appendix A.  Deployment Scenarios

   This Appendix describes the possible scenarios for deploying the
   Widex Framework.

A.1.  Simple Widex Elements

   In this scenario both devices running the Widex Server and the Widex
   Renderer are using the same platform.

A.2.  Multimodal Widex Server

   In this scenario the application running in the Widex Server is a
   multi-modal application compliant with W3C's Multimodal Architecture
   and Interfaces [MMI.Arch], enabling him to interact with several
   Widex Renderers.

A.3.  Multiple Rendering Engines Widex Renderer

   In this scenario the Widex Renderer has support for multiple
   rendering engines, enabling it to interact with several types of
   Widex Servers.

A.4.  Hybrid

   In this scenario the application running in the Widex Server is a
   multi-modal application and at the same time the Widex Renderer has
   multiple rendering capabilities.  It is the job of the Service
   Discovery and Session Setup component to determine which is the most
   appropriate modality of interaction.
