1.  Introduction
<2>
   This document is intended to provide updated information on the
   registration of the MIME Media Type "application/pdf" for documents
   defined in the PDF [ISOPDF], "Portable Document Format", syntax.
<3>
   PDF was originally envisioned as a way to reliably communicate and
   view printed information electronically across a wide variety of
   machine configurations, operating systems, and communication
   networks.
<4>
   PDF is used to represent "final form" formatted documents.  PDF pages
   may include text, images, graphics and multimedia content such as
   video and audio.  PDF is also capable of containing auxiliary
   structures including annotations, bookmarks, file attachments,
   hyperlinks, logical structure and metadata.  These features are
   useful for navigation, building collections of related documents and
   for reviewing and commenting on documents.  A rich JavaScript model
   has been defined for interacting with PDF documents.
<5>
   PDF used the imaging model of the PostScript [PS] page description
   language to render complex text, images, and graphics in a device and
   resolution-independent manner.
<6>
   PDF supports encryption and digital signatures.  The encryption
   capability is combined with access control information to facilitate
   management of the functionality available to the recipient.  PDF
   supports the inclusion of document and object-level metadata through
   the eXtensible Metadata Platform[XMP].

2.  History
<7>
   PDF is used widely in the Internet community.  The first version of
   PDF, 1.0, was published in 1993 by Adobe Systems.  Since then PDF has
   grown to be a widely-used format for capturing and exchanging
   formatted documents electronically across the Web, via e-mail and
   virtually every other document exchange mechanism.  In 2008, PDF 1.7
   was published as an ISO standard [ISOPDF], ISO 32000-1:2008.
<8>
   The ISO TC-171 committee is presently working on a refresh of PDF,
   known as ISO 32000-2, with a version of PDF 2.0, expected to be
   published in 2017.
<9>
   In addition to ISO 32000-1:2008 and 32000-2, several subset standards
   have been defined to address specific use cases and standardized by
   the ISO.  These standards include PDF for Archival (PDF/A), PDF for
   Engineering (PDF/E), PDF for Universal Accessibility (PDF/UA), PDF
   for Variable Data and Transactional Printing (PDF/VT) and PDF for
   Prepress Digital Data Exchange (PDF/X).  The subset standards are
   fully compliant PDF files capable of being displayed in a general PDF
   viewer.

3.  Fragment Identifiers
<10>
   A set of fragment identifiers [RFC3986] and their handling are
   defined in ISO 32000-2 [ISOPDF2].  This section summarizes that
   material.
<11>
   A fragment identifier is comprised of one or more parameters
   separated by the AMPERSAND (&) character.  Each parameter implies an
   action to be performed on the document and provides values to be used
   for that action; the values for a parameter are introduced by an
   EQUAL SIGN (=) and separated by a COMMA (,); values which are strings
   appear in the fragment identifier using URI's percent-hex escaping --
   spaces, reserved and non-ASCII strings are included by %nn encoding
   the UTF-8 of each character.  Actions shall be processed and executed
   from left to right as they appear in the character string that makes
   up the fragment identifier.
<12>
   The parameters listed in this section operate on the document at the
   point it is opened; for this reason they are sometimes referred to as
   PDF open parameters.  The fragment identifier should be processed
   immediately after document-specified open parameters have been
   processed.
<13>
   The table below lists the PDF open parameters relevant to PDF.  All
   coordinate values (left, right, top, and bottom) shall be expressed
   in the default user space coordinate system.

4.  Subset Standards
<15>
   Several subsets of PDF have been published as distinct ISO standards:
<16>
   o  PDF/X, initially released in 2001 as PDF/X-1a [ISOPDFX], specifies
      how to use PDF for graphics exchange, with the aim to fascilitate
      correct and predictable printing by print service providers.  The
      standard has gone through multiple revisions over the years and
      has several published parts, the most recently released being part
      8, specifying different levels of conformance: PDF/X-1a:2001, PDF/
      X-3:2002, PDF/X-1a:2003, PDF/X-3:2003, PDF/X-4, PDF/X-4p, PDF/X-5,
      PDF/X-5g, PDF/X-5pg and PDF/X-5n.
<17>
   o  PDF/A, initially released in 2005, specifies how to use PDF for
      long-term preservation (archiving) of electronic documents.  It
      prohibits PDF features which are not well suited to long term
      archiving of documents.  Its requirements for PDF/A viewers
      include color management guidelines and support for embedded
      fonts.  There are three parts of this standard and a total of
      eight conformance levels: PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-2b,
      PDF/A-2u, PDF/A-3a, PDF/A-3b and PDF/A-3u.
<18>
   o  PDF/E, initially released in 2008 as PDF/E-1 [ISOPDFE], specifies
      how to use PDF in engineering workflows, such as manufacturing,
      construction and geospatial analysis.  Future revisions of PDF/E
      are supposed to include support for 3D PDF workflows.
<19>
   o  PDF/VT, initially released in 2010, specifies how to use PDF in
      variable and transactional printing.  It is based on PDF/X, and
      adds adidtional restrictions on PDF content elements and
      supporting metadata.  It specifies three conformance levels: PDF/
      VT-1, PDF/VT-2 and PDF/VT-2s [ISOPDFVT].
<20>
   o  PDF/UA, initially released in 2012 as PDF/UA-1 [ISOPDFUA],
      specifies how to create accessible electonic documents.  It
      requires use of ISO 32000's Tagged PDF feature, and adds many
      requirements regarding semantic correctness in applying logical
      structures to content in PDF documents.
<21>
   All of these subset standards use "application/pdf" media type.  The
   subset standards are generally not exclusive, so it is possible to
   construct a PDF file which conforms to, for example, both PDF/A-2b
   and PDF/X-4 subset standards.

Internet-Draft               application/pdf                  April 2016


<22>
   PDF documents claiming conformance to one or more of the subset
   standards use XMP metadata to identify levels of conformance.  PDF
   processors should examine document metadata streams for such subset
   standards identifiers and, if apropriate, label documents as such
   when presenting them to the user.

5.  PDF Implementations
<23>
   PDF format has gone through several revisions, primarily for the
   addition of features.  PDF features have generally been added in a
   way that older viewers 'fail gracefully' because they can just ignore
   features they do not recognize, but even so, the older the PDF
   version produced, the more legacy viewers will support that version,
   but the fewer features will be enabled.
<24>
   PDF files are experienced through a reader or viewer of PDF files.
   For most of the common platforms in use (iOS, OS X, Windows, Android,
   ChromeOS, Kindle) and for most browsers (Edge, Safari, Chrome,
   Firefox), PDF viewing is built-in.  In addition, there are many PDF
   viewers available for download and install.  The PDF specification
   was published and freely available since the format was introduced in
   1993, so hundreds of companies and organizations make tools for PDF
   creation, viewing, and manipulation.

6.  Security Considerations
<25>
   The PDF file format allows several constructs which may compromise
   security if handled inadequately by PDF processors.  For example:
<26>
   o  PDF may contain scripts to customize the displaying and processing
      of PDF files.  These scripts are expressed in a version of
      JavaScript and are intended for execution by the PDF processor.
<27>
   o  PDF file may refer to other PDF files for portions of content
      using XObjects.  PDF processors are expected to find these
      external files and load them in order to display the document.
<28>
   o  PDF may act as a container for various files embedded in it (for
      example, as attached files).  PDF processors may offer
      functionality to open and display such files or store them on the
      system.
<29>
   o  PDF files may contain links to content on the internet.  PDF
      processors may offer functionality to show such content upon
      following the link.
<30>
   In addition, the PDF processor itself, as well as its plugins,

   scripts etc. may be a source of insecurity, by either obvious or
   subtle means.

7.  IANA Considerations
