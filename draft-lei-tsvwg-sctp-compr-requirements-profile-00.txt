           Requirements and ROHC compression profile for SCTP
           draft-lei-tsvwg-sctp-compr-requirements-profile-00

Abstract

   This document is to specify the requirements to compress headers of
   IP/SCTP package and how ROHC mechanism compresses SCTP.  Streaming
   Control Transport Protocol is new generation IP transport protocol
   which has been published in RFC2960 and updated by RFC4960.  SCTP can
   maintain association among multiple peers, thus supports multiple
   homing and multiple streaming, while inherits most functions of TCP.
   SCTP as transport protocol has been used to carry signaling or
   possible user plane data in turbulence network which needs to save
   spectrum resource by compressing IP headers.

Internet-Draft        Compression Profile for SCTP             June 2010


1.  Introduction

   SCTP RFC4960 [1] is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of
   a connectionless packet network such as IP.  SCTP has been used to
   carry signaling in LTE (Long Term Evolution) architecture which named
   as 3.9 generation wireless network.  SCTP is also potentially used to
   transfer user plane data in different type of access network.

   Robust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol provides an efficient,
   flexible, and future-proof header compression concept.  The ROHC
   framework, along with a set of compression profiles, was initially
   defined in RFC3095 [4].  In addition, ROHCv2 which predigests state
   transformation protocol was published in RFC5225 [5].

   As SCTP has been as the role of transport user data in various types
   of access network including some high error rate or turbulence
   environments, SCTP is to be compressed by ROHC protocol together IP
   headers.  The intention of this document is to finalize the header
   compression profile of IP/SCTP package and finally meets the
   requirements to reduce overhead due to duplicated IP/SCTP headers.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].


3.  Requirement and scenarios

   The following requirements have, more or less arbitrarily, been
   divided into five groups.  The first group deals with requirements
   concerning the impact of a header compression scheme on the rest of
   the Internet infrastructure.

3.1.  Scenarios to compress IP/SCTP package headers

   The original motivation is that the SCTP as transport protocol could
   be revealed in high error rate links.

   For instance, the venders of wireless network can settle intermediate
   base stations to supply radio access resource in particular area (hot
   spot or very few using area).

   The wireless link is established between the first base station and
   the second base station in above picture.  This wireless link between
   base stations takes responsibilities of user data and signaling
   transport.  Therefore, the transport protocol like SCTP will be
   desirable to transport user data and singalling at the same time
   within a SCTP association.  The protocol stack in such air interface
   could be found in following picture.


   Corresponding protocol stack:

         +-------------+      |     +-------------+
         | Application |------|-----| Application |
         +-------------+      |     +-------------+
         |   SCTP      |------|-----|   SCTP      |
         +-------------+      |     +-------------+
         |   IP        |------|-----|   IP        |
         +-------------+      |     +-------------+
         |   L2        |------|-----|   L2        |
         +-------------+      |     +-------------+
         |   L1        |------|-----|   L1        |

   SCTP packet can be used to carry signaling in the control plane of
   air interface in wireless network.  The scenarios which the wireless
   network architecture reveals IP/SCTP packets in air interface can
   explain the needs to compress headers of IP/SCTP packets.

Internet-Draft        Compression Profile for SCTP             June 2010


   In general, the IP/SCTP packets take place in air interface with at
   least IP/SCTP headers which are desirable to be compressed by ROHC
   mechanisms.  Since the SCTP association among endpoints is likely
   kept for a long time, the amount of reduced traffic in radio network
   could be remarkable from spectrum point of view.

3.2.  General requirements to ROHC protocol

   1.  Transparency: When a header is compressed and then decompressed,
   the resulting header must be semantically identical to the original
   header.  If this cannot be achieved, the packet containing the
   erroneous header must be discarded.

   Justification: The header compression process must not produce
   headers that might cause problems for any current or future part of
   the Internet infrastructure.

   Note: The ROHC WG has not found a case where "semantically identical"
   is not the same as "bitwise identical".

   2.  Ubiquity: Must not require modifications to existing IP (v4 or
   v6) or SCTP implementations.

   Justification: Ease of deployment.

   Note: The ROHC WG may recommend changes that would increase the
   compression efficiency for the SCTP streams emitted by
   implementations.  However, ROHC cannot rely on such recommendations
   being followed.

   3.  Compression efficiency

   The compression efficiency is determined by how much the average
   header size is reduced by applying the compression protocol.

   4.  Robustness

   A robust protocol tolerates packet losses, residual bit errors, and
   out-of-order delivery on the link over which header compression takes
   place, without losing additional packets or introducing additional
   errors in decompressed headers.

3.3.  Headers of IP package proposed to compress

   (1) IPv4 and IPv6: Must support both IPv4 and IPv6.  This means that
   all possible changes in the IP header fields must be handled by the
   compression scheme and commonly changing fields should be compressed
   efficiently.

Internet-Draft        Compression Profile for SCTP             June 2010


   Justification: IPv4 and IPv6 will both be around during the
   foreseeable future.

   (2) Mobile IP: The kinds of headers used by Mobile IP{v4,v6} must be
   supported and should be compressed efficiently.  For IPv4 these
   include headers of tunneled packets.  For IPv6 these include headers
   containing the Routing Header, the Binding Update Destination Option,
   and the Home Address option.

   Justification: It is very likely that Mobile IP will be used by
   cellular devices.

   (3) IPSEC: The scheme should be able to compress headers containing
   IPSEC sub-headers.

   Justification: IPSEC is expected to be used to provide necessary end-
   to-end security.

   Note: It is of course not possible to compress the encrypted part of
   an ESP header, nor the cryptographic data in an AH header.

3.4.  SCTP specific requirements

   (1) Performance/Spectral Efficiency: Must provide low relative
   overhead under expected operating conditions.

   Justification: Spectrum efficiency is the primary goal here.

   (2) Error propagation: For SCTP traffic, link layer retransmissions
   should be applied to make use of the bandwidth in the most efficient
   way.  Lost or damaged headers should thus not occur and therefore it
   is not a primary goal to have mechanisms for error propagation
   avoidance in case of such events.

   Justification: To provide robustness against loss or damage
   introduced by the link, efficiency must be sacrificed.  Since loss or
   damage is not expected for SCTP traffic, efficiency should instead be
   prioritized.  This does not mean that some robustness should not be
   provided, if efficiency can still be optimized.

   Note: In general, error propagation due to header compression should
   be kept at an absolute minimum.  Error propagation is defined as the
   loss or damage of headers subsequent to headers lost or damaged by
   the link, even if those subsequent headers are not lost or damaged.

   Note: There are at least two kinds of error propagation; loss
   propagation, where a lost header causes subsequent headers to be lost
   or damaged, and damage propagation, where a damaged header causes

   subsequent headers to be lost or damaged.

   (3) Short lived SCTP transfers: The scheme should provide mechanisms
   for efficient compression of short-lived SCTP transfers, minimizing
   the size of context initiation headers.

   Justification: Many SCTP transfers are short-lived.  This means that
   the gain of header compression could be low since normally header
   compression sends full headers initially and small compressed headers
   first after the initiation phase.

   Note: This requirement implies that mechanisms for "context sharing"
   or "context re-use" should be considered.

   (4a) Moderate Packet Reordering: The scheme should efficiently handle
   moderate reordering (2-3 packets) in the packet stream reaching the
   compressor.

   Justification: This kind of reordering is common.

   (4b) Packet Reordering: The scheme should be able to compress when
   there are reordered packets in the SCTP stream reaching the
   compressor.

   Justification: Reordering happens regularly in the Internet.
   However, since the Internet is engineered to run SCTP reasonably
   well, excessive reordering will not be common and need not be handled
   with optimum efficiency.

   (5) Processing delay: The scheme must not contribute significantly to
   system delay budget.

3.5.  Transport Protocol Requirements

   SCTP is connection-oriented in nature, but the SCTP association is a
   broader concept than the TCP connection.  SCTP provides the means for
   each SCTP endpoint to provide the other endpoint (during association
   startup) with a list of transport addresses (i.e., multiple IP
   addresses in combination with an SCTP port) through which that
   endpoint can be reached and from which it will originate SCTP
   packets.  The association spans transfers over all of the possible
   source/destination combinations that may be generated from each
   endpoint's lists.

   An SCTP packet is composed of a common header and chunks which
   contain either control information or user data.  A chunk is a unit
   of information within an SCTP packet, consisting of a chunk header
   and chunk-specific content.

   The SCTP packet format is shown below:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                          Chunk #n                             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                           SCTP Header Format


   The value of common headers would be mostly unchanged during
   signaling or data transportation.  Therefore, the common headers are
   expected to be compressed if the SCTP association last for long time,
   especially in case of high error rate link.  Even though the
   applications over SCTP like signaling is not sensitive to duplicated
   Chunk headers, the common headers of SCTP packets are still worth to
   compress as the same SCTP association carry multiple applications
   transportation.

   The common header of a SCTP package would be formed as:


        0                   1                   2                   3

   destination port, and possibly the destination IP address to identify
   the association to which this packet belongs.

   Destination Port Number:

   This is the SCTP port number to which this packet is destined.  The
   receiving host will use this port number to de-multiplex the SCTP
   packet to the correct receiving endpoint/application.

   Verification Tag:

   The receiver of this packet uses the Verification Tag to validate the
   sender of this SCTP packet.  On transmit, the value of this
   Verification Tag MUST be set to the value of the Initiate Tag
   received from the peer endpoint during the association
   initialization, with some exceptions.

   Checksum:

   This field contains the checksum of this SCTP packet.  SCTP uses the
   CRC32c algorithm as described in Appendix B for calculating the
   checksum.  Previous ROHC mechanisms do not rely on the function of
   Checksum of IP and transport protocol for robustness though Checksum
   is appreciate error detection approach.

   SCTP also defines a number of types of chunks in a SCTP package.  A
   number of Chunk types are used to initiate and maintains SCTP
   association.  Other registered SCTP Chunk types are used for
   particular application, and can be found at the website
   http://www.iana.org.  One Chunk type registered for 3GPP RAN2 and
   RAN3 S1-AP (S1 interface application (S1-AP) is the name of the
   protocol carry mobile network signaling.) is included in the
   compression profile, therefore the headers of S1-AP Chunk type are in
   the scope of this document.

   The types and the value of Chunks are listed as following:

   The U/B/E is defined for indicating reordering, beginning fragment
   and ending fragment in the SCTP packet.

   Length

   This field indicates the length of the DATA chunk in bytes from the
   beginning of the type field to the end of the User Data field
   excluding any padding.  A DATA chunk with one byte of user data will
   have Length set to 17 (indicating 17 bytes).

   A DATA chunk with a User Data field of length L will have the Length
   field set to (16 + L) (indicating 16+L bytes) where L MUST be greater
   than 0.

   TSN:

   This value represents the TSN for this DATA chunk.  The valid range
   of TSN is from 0 to 4294967295 (2**32 - 1).  TSN wraps back to 0
   after reaching 4294967295.

   Stream Identifier S:

   Identifies the stream to which the following user data belongs.

   Stream Sequence Number n:

   This value represents the Stream Sequence Number of the following
   user data within the stream S. Valid range is 0 to 65535.  When a
   user message is fragmented by SCTP for transport, the same Stream
   Sequence Number MUST be carried in each of the fragments of the
   message.

   Payload Protocol Identifier:

   This value represents an application (or upper layer) specified
   protocol identifier.  This value is passed to SCTP by its upper layer
   and sent to its peer.  This identifier is not used by SCTP but can be
   used by certain network entities, as well as by the peer application,
   to identify the type of information being carried in this DATA chunk.
   This field must be sent even in fragmented DATA chunks (to make sure
   it is available for agents in the middle of the network).  Note that
   this field is NOT touched by an SCTP implementation; therefore, its
   byte order is NOT necessarily big endian.  The upper layer is
   responsible for any byte order conversions to this field.

   The value 0 indicates that no application identifier is specified by
   the upper layer for this payload data.

4.  Compression and Design Rationale

4.1.  Supports to ROHCv1 and ROHCv2

   ROHCv1 was defined in RFC3095 [4].  The ROHCv2 was defined in RFC5225
   [5].  The header compression profile for SCTP would be compliant with
   ROHCv1 and ROHCv2 mechanisms.  The vales of compression profile would
   be identified as profile for ROHCv1 and profile for ROHCv2.

4.2.  Operation Assumptions

   Cellular links, which are a primary target for ROHC, have a number of
   characteristics that are described briefly here.  SCTP is a type of
   transport protocol to establish a peer to peer association between
   two endpoints which are able to transfer multiple sorts of
   applications.  The applications between SCTP endpoint in an
   association include signaling, user data and other association
   maintenance messages.  The pre-defined assumptions are to clarify
   some concepts of compressing SCTP packets headers.

   ROHC profile:

   A ROHC profile is a compression protocol, which specifies how to
   compress specific header combinations.  Each compression profile is
   associated with a unique ROHC profile identifier.  As this profile is
   used in ROHCv1 and ROHCv2 frameworks, this document would specify two
   values of compression profile.  Each value of profile is associated
   with one version of ROHC framework.  When setting up a ROHC channel,
   the set of profiles supported by both endpoints of the channel is
   negotiated, and when initializing new contexts, a profile identifier
   from this negotiated set is used to associate each compression
   context with one specific profile.

   In this document, to address the requirements of compressing SCTP
   packet header, ROHC profile for SCTP packet headers is defined to
   recognize and adopt the situation which a SCTP association can start
   or shutdown a type of chunk except other running chunks.

   Link:

   A physical transmission path that constitutes a single IP hop.
   Similar concept is align with Channel in RFC3095.  Each Link has
   different characteristics in terms of error rate, bandwidth, etc.

   Flow:

   A transportation between peers of a SCTP association, which is
   carried by one chunk of SCTP packet.  SCTP association can transfer



Zhu                     Expires December 24, 2010              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Compression Profile for SCTP             June 2010


   more than one flow at the same time due to SCTP multiple homing
   ability.

   Negotiation:

   The link layer already provides the way to negotiate header
   compression parameters, e.g. network configuration parameters of 3GPP
   RAN2 procedure.  The ROHC layer SHOULD also assure the ROHC context
   the particular states and parameters known by compressor and
   decompressor, e.g. the value of profile, the specific parameters of
   each profile of an IR or CO packet.

4.3.  Concept of SCTP packet compression

   Compression scheme for SCTP packet MUST support compress common
   header of the SCTP packet, while transport other Chunk headers as
   uncompressed state.  The compression scheme for SCTP packet SHOULD
   support compress Chunk header of part of Chunks in the SCTP packet.
   The compression scheme for SCTP packet SHOULD be capable to inform
   the identifier of Chunks which headers are to compress, and which
   MUST be known by decompressor.  According to the definition of SCTP
   RFC5225 [5], the Chunks of the SCTP packet can be identified by Chunk
   identifier and Chunk type.  Additionally, as the mandatory headers to
   compress, the common headers of the SCTP would be not normally
   informed to the Decompressor.

   Therefore, the compressor can take into account starting compression
   of SCTP packet while a Chunk of a particular Chunk type is
   established, in addition to compressed common headers of SCTP packet.

   In principle, the compressor can start and shutdown the compression
   to the flows carried by Chunks.  To fulfill this point, the
   indication to start or shutdown the compression to the Chunks can be
   obtained in IR packet and IR-CR packets as specific information of
   SCTP compression profile.

4.4.  Compressor and Decompressor Interactions

4.4.1.  Behavior of Compressor

   The operation between compressor and decompressor can illustrate the
   characters of compressing interactions.  The operation of the
   compressor is to initiate ROHC context by sending the information
   which is essential to decompressor the packet.  The assumption to
   decompress the packet sent by compressor is based on the
   understanding of compression profile with a value which is sent in an
   Initiate and Refresh packet (IR).  The information how to decompress
   the packet is obtained in initiate and updating behavior, in

Internet-Draft        Compression Profile for SCTP             June 2010


   addition, the decompressor can optionally response those information
   from feedback messages.

   If the compressor believes the SCTP to sent will be compressed
   utilizing the particular compression scheme, the compressor MUST
   initiate compression context by sending IR packet with particular
   profile number.

4.4.2.  Behavior of Compressor

   Remember, it's important to acknowledge people who have contributed
   to the work.

   Attentions to SIP signaling compression related to this draft are
   expected.


5.  Packet Types

5.1.  Initialization and Refresh (IR) Packets

   The IR header format uses the structure of the ROHC IR header as
   defined in Section 5.2.2.1 of RFC5795 [3].

   Header type: IR

   This header format communicates the static part and the dynamic part
   of the context.


        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
       --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
      :        Add-CID octet          : if for small CIDs and (CID != 0)
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 1   1   1   1   1   1   0   1 | IR type octet
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      :                               :
      /       0-2 octets of CID       / 1-2 octets if for large CIDs

      :                               :
      /  Profile specific Information / 2 octet
      :                               :
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   CRC: 8-bit CRC over the entire IR-header, including any CID fields
   and up until the end of the dynamic chain, using the polynomial
   defined in RFC5795 [3].  For purposes of computing the CRC, the CRC
   field is zero.

   Profile specific Information:

   Compression profile for SCTP specifies owned specific information.
   The function of profile information can setup or close header
   compression to particular Flow of a Chunk.  Thus, the compressor and
   decompressor using this compression profile for SCTP could compress
   common headers and headers of part of Chunks in a SCTP packet.  For
   example, the common headers and headers of user date Chunk could be
   compressed by compressor except other headers of Chunks.  In
   particular scenario, it is possible for compressor to compress only
   common headers of SCTP packet in case the SCTP association last very
   long time and just serves for signaling transportations.

   The format of compression profile information:


                 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         |        Chunk ID               | 1 Octet Chunk Identifiers
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         |        Chunk Type         | CF| Chunk type and chunk flag
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


   Chunk ID:

   Chunk Identifier (Chunk ID) indicate the Chunk of the SCTP packet
   which the Initiation and Refresh (IR) packet is to handle.  Chunk
   Identifier is a 8 octets value which is corresponding Chunk of the
   SCTP packets to be compressed.

   Chunk Type:

   Chunk Type is associated with Chunk ID.  Chunk Type in IR packet is a
   7 octets value which can cover existing Chunk Types of SCTP packet
   and other 111 available value of Chunk Types for further
   considerations.

   CF:

   Chunk Flag (CF) indicates the start or end of compression operation
   to headers of particular Chunk which is identified by Chunk ID and
   Chunk Type.  The CF with value '1' indicates the start of compression

Internet-Draft        Compression Profile for SCTP             June 2010


   operation.  The CF with value '0' indicates the end of compression
   operation.

5.2.  IR-DYN Packets

   ROHCv2 does not define IR-DYN packet by comparison with corresponding
   definition of IR-DYN packets.  If the compression context is
   established based on protocol of RPHCv1, the format of IR-DYN is very
   similar with format of IR packet.  Please previous subsection.

5.3.  Compressed (CO) Packets

   The ROHCv2 co_repair header has the following format:


          0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
        :         Add-CID octet         : if for small CIDs and CID 1-15
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
        | 1   1   1   1   1   0   1   1 | discriminator
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
        :                               :
        /   0, 1, or 2 octets of CID    / 1-2 octets if large CIDs
        :                               :
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
        |r1 |         CRC-7             |
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
        |        r2         |   CRC-3   |
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
        |                               |
        /         Dynamic chain         / variable length
        |                               |
         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


   The parameters of CO packet were illustrated in section 6.8.2.2 of
   RFC5225 [5].


6.  Header Formats

6.1.  Feedback Formats and Options

6.1.1.  Feedback Formats

   ROHCv2 extents use of feedback packet for Compressor and
   Decompressor.  The Feedback packets response the information of
   Decompressor for one ROHC Context as a whole.

Internet-Draft        Compression Profile for SCTP             June 2010


   If the Compressor can distinguish compression information of
   particular Chunk headers from Feedback information is the question
   for TBD.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The compression profile for SCTP packet can be used in environments
   with or without feedback capabilities from decompressor to
   compressor.  The reception of either positive acknowledgment (ACKs)
   or negative acknowledgment (NACKs) establishes the feedback channel
   from the decompressor for the context for which the feedback was
   received.  The compression profile has not adopted the feedback
   concept to each flow binding particular Chunk.

   The start of feedback highly relies on full duplex Channel of links.
   The feedback (either ACK or NACK) SHOULD be distinguished by
   resolving Context identifiers, MSN or LSB, and other possible
   identifier.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
