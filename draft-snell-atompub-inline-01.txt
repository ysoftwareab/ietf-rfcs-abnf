1.  Introduction

   This specification introduces a mechanism to the Atom Syndication
   Format which publishes of Atom document can use to embed
   representations of linked resources into a child element of the atom:
   link element.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

    "atom": "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"


3.  The 'atom:inline' element

   The atom:inline element MAY be used as the child of an atom:link
   element to embed representations of the resource referenced by the
   containing atom:link.

     inline = element atom:inline {
       (text|anyElement)*
     }

   An atom:link element MUST NOT contain more than one atom:inline
   element.

   If the value of the containing link element's type attribute begins
   with "text/" (case insensitive), the content of atom:inline MUST NOT
   contain child elements.

   If the value of the link element's type attribute is an XML media
   type [RFC3023] or ends with "+xml" or "/xml" (case insensitive), the
   content of the atom:inline element MAY include child elements and
   SHOULD be suitable for handling as the indicated media type.  This
   would normally mean that the atom:inline element would contain a
   single child element that would serve as the root element of the XML
   document of the indicated type.

   If the value of the link element's type attribute is "application/
   json" or ends with "+json" or "/json" (case insensitive), and the

   character-set encoding of the enclosing Atom document is UTF-8,
   UTF-16 or UTF-32, the content of the atom:inline element MUST be the
   plain-text representation of the linked JSON document.  The content
   MAY be preceded and followed in the atom:inline element by white
   space.

   For all other values of the type attribute, the content of atom:
   inline MUST be a valid Base64 encoding, as described in [RFC3548],
   section 3.  When decoded, it SHOULD be suitable for handling as the
   indicated media type.  In this case, the characters in the Base64
   encoding MAY be preceded and followed in the atom:inline element by
   white space, and lines are separated by a single newline (U+000A)
   character.
