Internet-Draft            DKIM Joint Signatures           September 2010


1.  Introduction

   DKIM Joint Signatures provides a means to limit the responsibility of
   a message that implied by signing it, and possibly transfer the
   responsibility to a third party.  It consists of header data,
   external to the DKIM-Signature field, that requires a trusted third
   party signature.  Such co-signer takes its share of the
   responsibility like all signers do, but the meaning of its role is
   augmented by the new DKIM-Required field.

   Joint Signatures are especially useful when the message is supposed
   to be resent or forwarded, e.g. if it is destined to a Mailing List.
   However, they can be used whenever limiting the responsibility of the
   Author Domain is considered useful.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The DKIM-Required Field

   This specification introduces a new message header field defined as
   follows, using grammar imported from RFC 5322 [RFC5322].  RFC 4871
   [RFC4871] describes DKIM.

   dkim-required   = "DKIM-Required:" required-domain CRLF

   required-domain = dot-atom

   The presence of a DKIM-Required field affects the validity of any
   DKIM-Signature that had signed it.  A signer MAY add one DKIM-
   Required field, e.g. if instructed to do so by local configuration.
   However, a signer MUST NOT add more than one DKIM-Required field.

   When a verifier finds any DKIM-Required field within the header field
   names in the "h=" tag of the signature being verified, and none of
   the following conditions hold, the verifier SHOULD ignore the
   signature and return PERMFAIL (signature did not verify).  The
   conditions are:

   1.  The required-domain matches the domain in this signature's "d="
       tag;

   2.  another signature in the same message has a "d=" tag matching the
       required-domain, it includes this DKIM-Required field in its "h="
       tag, and it verifies correctly; or

   3.  the verifier has access to a private key of the required-domain,
       i.e. it acts on behalf of it, and could produce the signature at
       point 2 itself if it wanted to.

   DKIM-Required fields that are not signed can be safely ignored.
   Software incapable of signing SHOULD NOT add these fields.


4.  IANA Considerations

   The new header would have to be registered.


5.  Security Considerations

   If a signer trusts that the (only) recipient of a message will duly
   sign it before exploding, and secure SMTP is used, then it MAY safely
   sign only a few header fields and a limited portion of the body.  By
   adding a DKIM-Required header it effectively limits the
   responsibility of the Author Domain.

   Even if final recipients are not aware of this specification, after
   all required signatures have been added the Author Domain's status
   and reputation are good.
