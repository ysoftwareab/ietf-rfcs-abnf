 1. Overview 
     
    The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) 
    Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and Protocols 
    for Advanced Networking (TISPAN) is defining the release 2 of the 
    TISPAN Next Generation Network (NGN) aiming at the creation of a 
    multimedia fixed network.  Generally NGN is based on the 3rd 
    Generation mobile Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia 
    Subsystem (IMS) Release 7 with additions required to support the 
    fixed access. 
     
    While ETSI is committed to the creation of new multimedia 
    applications and services, the importance of providing support to 
    existing Integrated Services Digital Network and Public Switched 
    Telephone Network (ISDN/PSTN) supplementary services has also been 
    acknowledged. 
     
 2. Overall Applicability 
     
    The SIP extensions specified in this document make certain 
    assumptions regarding network topology, linkage between SIP and 
    lower layers, and the availability of transitive trust.  These 
    assumptions are generally NOT APPLICABLE in the Internet as a 
    whole.  The mechanisms specified here were designed to satisfy 
    service specific requirements specified in the release 2 of the 
    TISPAN Next Generation Network (NGN) on SIP [4] for which either no 
    general-purpose solution was planned, where insufficient 
    operational experience was available to understand if a general 
    solution is needed, or where a more general solution is not yet 
    mature.  For more details about the assumptions made about these 
    extensions, consult the Applicability subsection for each 
    extension. 
     
 3. Terminology 
     
    In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
    "MAY",and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
    [9] and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations. 
     
 4. SIP Private Headers 
     
 4.1 The P-Service-Notification header 
     
    This extension allows an entity to send a notification about 
    service specific information to a user.  The P-Service-Notification 
    header can be used in SIP requests as well as in responses.  This 
    requirement is stated in the TISPAN requirements on SIP [2].

 Internet-Draft     Service Indication Notification          July 2007 

    A typical deployment situation occurs when a SIP request arrives at 
    the UAS and a service conditioned notification needs to be sent 
    back to the UAC. An example for this is when an INVITE request 
    arrives at a callee who is already involved in a call, and the 
    callee wants to inform the caller that this call is a waiting call. 
     
    4.1.1 Applicability statement for the P-Service-Notification header 
     
    The P-Service-Notification is applicable when an entity needs to 
    notify an UA about the status of a service applied by this entity. 
     
    4.1.2 Usage of the P-Service-Notification header 
     
    The P-Service-Notification header field provides an UA with the 
    status of a service of that moment when the information is sent.  
    This information is intended to be rendered to the user. 
     
    4.1.2.1 Procedures at the UA 
     
    A UAC MAY insert a P-Service-Notification header field with a value 
    according to the service currently applied in any SIP request or 
    response. 
     
    A UAS may insert a P-Service-Notification header field with a value 
    according to the service currently applied in any SIP request or 
    response. 
     
    4.1.2.2 Procedures at the proxy 
     
    A proxy may insert a P-Service-Notification header field with a 
    value according to the service currently applied in any SIP request 
    or response. 
     
 4.2 The P-Service-Indication header 
     
    This extension allows an entity to send an indication about service 
    specific proceeding required for the applied service to a UA or a 
    proxy.  The P-Service-Indication header can be used in SIP requests 
    as well as in responses.  This requirement is stated in the TISPAN 
    requirements on SIP [2]. 
     
     
    A typical deployment situation occurs when a SIP request arrives at 
    a proxy and an indication for a service specific proceeding of this 
    request needs to be send to the UA. An example for this is when an 
    INVITE request arrives at a proxy with the function of an 
    application server that is in control of network resources and 
    needs to indicate to the callee that he should release consumed 
    resources before accepting this call. 
     
    4.2.1 Applicability statement for the P-Service-Indication header 
  
 Ott                      Expires January 2008                  Page 4 
 Internet-Draft     Service Indication Notification          July 2007 

     
    The P-Service-Indication header is applicable when an entity needs 
    to indicate a service specific proceeding of a request or a 
    response to an UA or a proxy. 
     
    4.2.2 Usage of the P-Service-Indication header 
     
    The P-Service-Indication header field provides an UA or a proxy 
    with an indication how to proceed the SIP request or response in 
    the context of a specific service. 
     
    4.2.2.1 Procedures at the UA 
     
    A UAC MAY insert a P-Service-Indication header field with a value 
    according to the service currently applied in any SIP request or 
    response. 
     
    A UAS may insert a P-Service-Indication header field with a value 
    according to the service currently applied in any SIP request or 
    response. 
     
    4.2.2.2 Procedures at the proxy 
     
    A proxy may insert a P-Service-Indication header field with a value 
    according to the service currently applied in any SIP request or 
    response. 
     
     
 5. Formal Syntax 
     
    All of the mechanisms specified in this document are described in 
    both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in RFC 
    2234 [3].  Further, several BNF definitions are inherited from SIP 
    and are not repeated here.  Implementers need to be familiar with 
    the notation and contents of SIP [1] and RFC 2234 [3] to understand 
    this document. 
     
 5.1 P-Service-Notification header syntax 
     
    The following summarizes the syntax of the P-Service-Notification, 
    based upon the standard SIP syntax [RFC 3261] 
     
    P-Service-Notification = "P-Service-Notification"  
                              HCOLON notification 
    notification          = "user-suspended" /"user-resumed" / 
                            "conference-established" / 
                            "conference-disconnected" / 
                            "other-party-added" / 
                            "isolated" / "reattached" / 
                            "other-party-isolated" / 
                            "other-party-reattached" /

                            "other-party-split" / 
                            "other-party-disconnected" / 
                            "conference-floating" / 
                            "call-is-a-waiting call" / 
                            "diversion-activated" / 
                            "call-transfer-alerting" / 
                            "call-transfer-active" / "remote-hold" / 
                            "remote-retrieval" / "call-is-diverting" / 
                             TOKEN 
     
     
 5.2 P-Service-Indication header syntax 
     
    The following summarizes the syntax of the P-Service-Indication, 
    based upon the standard SIP syntax [RFC 3261] 
     
    P-Service-Indication = "P-Service-Indication"  
                              HCOLON indication 
    Indication           = "CW" /"CCBS" / "CCNR" / TOKEN 
     
 5.3 Table of new headers 
     
    Table 1 extends the headers defined in this document to Table 2 in 
    SIP [1], section 7.1 of the SIP-specific event notification [6], 
    tables 1 and 2 in the SIP INFO method [8], tables 1 and 2 in 
    Reliability of provisional responses in SIP [7], tables 1 and 2 in 
    the SIP UPDATE method [9], tables 1 and 2 in the SIP extension for 
    Instant Messaging [10], and table 1 in the SIP REFER method [11]:

 6. Security Considerations 
     
 6.1  P-Service-Notification header 
     
    The information returned in the P-Service-Notification header is 
    not viewed as particularly sensitive.  Rather, it is simply 
    informational in nature.  If end-to-end protection is not used at 
  
 Ott                      Expires January 2008                  Page 6 
 Internet-Draft     Service Indication Notification          July 2007 

    the SIP layer, it is possible for proxies to modify the contents of 
    the header value.  This attack, while potentially annoying, should 
    not have significant impacts. 
     
 6.2 P-Service-Indication header 
     
    The information returned in the P-Service-Indication header is 
    viewed as particularly sensitive.  An indication is sensitive, 
    potentially private, information.  Therefore, indications SHOULD be 
    sent in such a way to ensure confidentiality, message integrity and 
    verification of subscriber identity, such as sending indications 
    using a SIPS URL. 
     
 7. IANA Considerations 
     
    This document defines several private SIP extension header fields 
    (beginning with the prefix "P-"). 
     
    These extension headers have been included in the registry of SIP 
    header fields defined in SIP [1].  Expert review is required for 
    this process by the SIP Working Group. 
     
    The following extensions are registered as private extension header 
    fields: 
     
       RFC Number:         RFCxxx 
       Header Field Name:  P-Service-Notification 
       Compact Form:       none 
     
     
       RFC Number:         RFCxxx 
       Header Field Name:  P-Service-Indication 
       Compact Form:       none
