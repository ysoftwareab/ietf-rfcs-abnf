Abstract

    In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism
    which is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match
    or a glob-style wildcard match.  The regular expression matching
    mechanism defined in this draft should allow users to isolate just
    about any string or address in a message header or envelope.

Internet Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension        January 15, 2001


1.  Introduction

    This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [SIEVE] for
    comparing strings to regular expressions.

    Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
    use of [KEYWORDS].


2.  Capability Identifier

    The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
    document is "regex".


3.  Regex Match Type

    Commands that support matching may take the optional tagged argument
    ":regex" to specify that a regular expression match should be
    performed.  The ":regex" match type is subject to the same rules and
    restrictions as the standard match types defined in [SIEVE].  For
    convenience, the "MATCH-TYPE" syntax element defined in [SIEVE] is
    augmented here as follows:

         MATCH-TYPE  =/  ":regex"


    Example:

          require "regex";

          # Try to catch unsolicited email.
          if anyof (
            # if a message is not to me (with optional +detail),
            not address :regex ["to", "cc", "bcc"]
              "me(\\+.*)?@company.com",

            # or the subject contains 2 or more dollar signs,
            header :regex "subject" "\\$\\$+",

            # or the subject is all uppercase (no lowercase)
            header :regex :comparator "i;octet" "subject"
              "^[^:lower:]*$" ) {

            discard;     # junk it
          }

Internet Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension        January 15, 2001


    The ":regex" match type is compatible with both the "i;octet" and
    "i;ascii-casemap" comparators and may be used with them.

    Implementations MUST support extended regular expressions (EREs) as
    defined by [POSIX.2].  Any regular expression not defined by
    [POSIX.2], including [POSIX.2] basic regular expressions, word
    boundaries and backreferences are not supported by this extension.

    The following table provides a brief summary of the regular
    expressions that MUST be supported.  This table is presented here
    only as a guideline.  [POSIX.2] should be used as the definitive
    reference.


    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | Expression |  Pattern                                            |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |                Items to match a single character                 |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |     .      |  Match any single character except newline.         |
    |    [ ]     |  Bracket expression.  Match any one of the enclosed |
    |            |  characters.  A hypen (-) indicates a range of      |
    |            |  consecutive characters.                            |
    |   [^  ]    |  Negated bracket expression.  Match any one         |
    |            |  character NOT in the enclosed list.  A hypen (-)   |
    |            |  indicates a range of consecutive characters.       |
    |    \\      |  Escape the following special character (match      |
    |            |  the literal character).  Undefined for other       |
    |            |  characters.                                        |
    |            |  NOTE: Unlike [POSIX.2], a double-backslash is      |
    |            |  required as per section 2.4.2 of [SIEVE].          |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Items to be used within a bracket expression (localization)    |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |   [: :]    |  Character class (alnum, alpha, blank, cntrl,       |
    |            |  digit, graph, lower, print, punct, space,          |
    |            |  upper, xdigit).                                    |
    |   [= =]    |  Character equivalents.                             |
    |   [. .]    |  Collating sequence.                                |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |  Quantifiers - Items to count the preceding regular expression   |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |     ?      |  Match zero or one instances.                       |
    |     *      |  Match zero or more instances.                      |
    |     +      |  Match one or more instances.                       |
    |   {n,m}    |  Match any number of instances between              |
    |            |  n and m (inclusive).  {n} matches exactly n        |
    |            |  instances.  {n,} matches n or more instances.      |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |              Anchoring - Items to match positions                |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |     ^      |  Match the beginning of the line or string.         |
    |     $      |  Match the end of the line or string.               |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

4.  Security Considerations

    Security considerations are discussed in [SIEVE].  It is believed
    that this extension doesn't introduce any additional security
    concerns.
