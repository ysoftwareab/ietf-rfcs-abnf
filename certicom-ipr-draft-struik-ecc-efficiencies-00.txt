To the extent that the reference in IV., supra, is incorporated in an IETF RFC, Certicom informs that it and its Affiliates will make a license available on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory ("FRAND") terms and conditions based on reciprocity to all persons desiring to implement such IETF RFC for those claims of the Disclosed Patents only that would, in the absence of a license, be necessarily infringed by the use of a right (e.g. making, using, selling, importing, distribution, copying, etc) with respect to a technology implementing such IETF RFC (the "License"). In this context, "necessarily infringed" means that such claims are technically necessary to implement the IETF RFC in question.

“Affiliate” of Certicom Corp. means any legal entity that is for the time being directly or indirectly in control of or controlled by Certicom Corp.  Control in this context, exists where one entity owns more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock or equity in another entity, or regardless of stock or equity ownership, is otherwise able to direct its affairs or to appoint a majority of the members of the board of directors or an equivalent body to determine the course of action of the entity by virtue of its voting or other rights. Such entities shall only be deemed to be Affiliates, hereunder for as long as such control exists.
