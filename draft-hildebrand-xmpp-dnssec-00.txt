                      DNSSEC for XMPP SRV Records
                  draft-hildebrand-xmpp-dnssec-00.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes that DNS SRV records that can be trusted via
   DNSSEC signatures may be used to generate a list of acceptable names
   to check on server certificates offered by TLS.

Internet-Draft                 XMPP-DNSSEC                    March 2011


1.  Introduction

   XMPP uses SRV records for clients and servers to find servers for a
   given domain.  Today, since the SRV record cannot be trusted, the
   server has to offer a TLS certificate that matches the original
   domain name, rather than one for the hostname in the SRV record.
   Deployment of delegated hosts would be much easier if the host could
   offer a certificate with the host name, rather than having to offer a
   certificate with the original domain name.

   This document proposes that the server may offer a cert with any of
   the names generated from looking up trusted DNS entries.

   Note:  this document is only intended as a placeholder; it will be
   dramatically expanded later.  As well it is likely that this approach
   is useful for protocols other than XMPP.


2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview

   The following steps are followed by a provider hosting "example.com"
   on the server "host1.example.net":

   1.  The owner of "example.com" serves an SRV record for "_xmpp-
       server._tcp.example.com" and "_xmpp-client._tcp.example.com", for
       example "0 1 5269 host1.example.net." might be used for each.
   2.  The owner of "example.com" MUST ensure that "example.com" is
       signed using DNSSEC [RFC4035], and that the SRV record is also
       signed using DNSSEC.
   3.  The hosting provider at "host1.example.net" generates a [RFC5280]
       PKIX certificate and has it signed by a widely-trusted
       Certificate Authority.
   4.  The hosting provider offers the generated certificate to anyone
       who connects and wants to talk to "example.com".

   The following steps are followed by an initiating entity connecting
   to "example.com":

   1.  The initiator starts with an empty name list L.

   2.  The initiator adds the original domain name ("example.com" here)
       to L
   3.  The initiator does the normal SRV lookup, asking its resolver for
       DNSEC trust information.
   4.  For each hostname, CNAME, A or AAAA record that the initiator
       finds which is fully trustable according to DNSSEC, that name or
       IP address is added to L.
   5.  The initiator connects to the server as specified in XMPP
       [I-D.ietf-xmpp-3920bis], specifying "example.com" in the stream
       to attribute.  Other protocols might use SNI [RFC4366] to
       indicate the desired host name.
   6.  The initiator MUST check each name in L against the certificate
       offered by the responder, using the rules specified in section
       13.7.2 of [I-D.ietf-xmpp-3920bis] (or the equivalent rules for
       the target protocol).
