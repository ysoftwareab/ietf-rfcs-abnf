              Enabling secure network join in RPL networks
             draft-richardson-6tisch-roll-join-priority-00

Abstract

   [I-D.richardson-6tisch-join-enhanced-beacon] defines a method by
   which a potential [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] can announce
   itself as a available for new Pledges to Join a network.  The
   announcement includes a priority for join.  This document provides a
   mechanism by which a RPL DODAG root can disable join announcements,
   or adjust the base priority for join operation.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7554] describes the use of the time-slotted channel hopping
   (TSCH) mode of [ieee802154].  [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] and
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join] describe mechanisms by which
   a new node (the "pledge)" can use a friendly router as a Join Proxy.
   [I-D.richardson-6tisch-join-enhanced-beacon] describes an extension
   to the 802.15.4 Enhanced Beacon that is used by a Join Proxy to
   announce its existence such that Pledges can find them.

   It has become clear that not every routing member of the mesh ought
   to announce itself as a Join Proxy.  There are a variety of local
   reasons by which a 6LR might not want to provide the Join Proxy
   function.  They include available battery power, already committed
   network bandwidth, and also total available memory available for Join
   proxy neighbor cache slots.

   There are other situations where the operator of the network would
   like to selective enable or disable the join process in a particular
   DODAG.

   As the join process involves permitting unencrypted traffic into the
   best effort part of a (TSCH) network, it would be better to have the
   join process off when no new nodes are expected.

   A network operator might also be able to recognize when certain parts
   of the network are overloaded and can not accomodate additional join
   traffic, and it would like to adjust the join priority among all
   nodes in the subtree of a congested link.

Internet-Draft                 J-Pref DIO                      July 2017


   This document describes an RPL DIO option that can be used to
   announce a minimum join priority.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

   In addition, the terminology of [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology] and
   from [I-D.ietf-anima-voucher] are used.

2.  Protocol Definition

   The following option is defined to transmission in the DIO issued by
   the DODAG root.  It may also be added by a router on part of the sub-
   tree as a result of some (out of scope for this document) management
   function.

   6LRs that see this DIO Option SHOULD increment the minimum priority
   if they observe congestion on the channel used for join traffic.
   (TODO: how much?  Do we need to standardize this?)

   A 6LR which would otherwise be willing to act as a Join Proxy, will
   examine the minimum priority field, and to that number, add any
   additional local consideration (such as upstream congestion).  The
   resulting priority, if less than 0x7f should enable the Join Proxy
   function.

       0                   1                   2
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Type = TBD01|Opt Length = 1|R| min. priority  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   min.priority  a 7 bit field which provides a base value for the
      Enhanced Beacon Join priority.  A value of 0x7f (127) disables the
      Join Proxy function entirely.

   R  a reserved bit that SHOULD be set to 0 by senders, and MUST be
      ignored by receivers.  The reserved bit SHOULD be copied to
      options created.

3.  Security Considerations

   As per [RFC7416], RPL control frames either run over a secured layer
   2, or use the [RFC6550] Secure DIO methods.  This option can be
   placed into either a "clear" (layer-2 secured) DIO, or a layer-3
   Secure DIO.  As such this option will have both integrity and
   confidentiality mechanisms applied to it.

   A malicious node (that was part of the RPL control plane) could see
   these options and could, based upon the observed minimal join
   priority signal a confederate that it was a good time to send
   malicious join traffic.

   A malicious node (that was part of the RPL control plane) could also
   send DIOs with a different minimal join priority which would cause
   downstream mesh routers to change their Join Proxy behaviour.  Lower
   minimal priorities would cause downstream nodes to accept more
   pledges than the network was expecting, and higher minimal priorities
   cause the join process to stall.

   The use of layer-2 or layer-3 security for RPL control messages
   prevents the above two attacks.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   There are no new privacy issues caused by this extension.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate a new number TBD01 from Registry RPL Control Message
   Options.  This entry should be called Minimum Join Priority.

6.  Acknowledgements

   none so far.
