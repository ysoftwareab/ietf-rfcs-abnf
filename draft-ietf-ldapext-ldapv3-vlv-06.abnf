beforeCount = 0, afterCount = 19, contentCount = 0, offset = 1 and 
targetPosition = 1. We therefore leave the scroll bar slider at its 
offset = 78564 and send the request to the server. The server returns 

    
targetPosition = 78564. 
    
beforeCount = 0, afterCount = 19, contentCount = 78564, offset = 
afterCount = 10, contentCount = 78564, offset = 53424 and send the 
afterCount = 10 and greaterThanOrEqual = "B". The server finds the 
targetPosition = 5234 and so the client updates its scroll bar slider
