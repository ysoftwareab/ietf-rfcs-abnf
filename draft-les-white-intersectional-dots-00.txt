The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) prides itself on its open
philosophy, where anyone can submit a proposal or comment on work in progress,
regardless of financial resources, industry credentials, race, gender, sexual
orientation, or national origin, without any review by the organization.
Regrettably, sometimes individuals abuse that openness by submitting texts that
are disrespectful of others, in violation of the IETF Code of Conduct [1] and
anti-harassment policy [2].

On 1 April 2021, there were two examples of anonymous proposals that were both
racist and deeply disrespectful, thus violating policy. The Internet
Engineering Steering Group (IESG) has accordingly removed these documents from
the IETF website.
