   ReSerVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling.

Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 
    
   Moreover, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology 
   MEF.10 as well as [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].   
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Per [RFC3471], GMPLS allows the inclusion of technology specific 
   parameters in signaling. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC specific 
   objects are introduced in this document that describes Metro Ethernet 
   Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic parameters as specified in [MEF.10]. 
    
   These traffic parameters MUST be used when L2SC is specified in the 
   LSP Switching Type field of a Generalized Label Request (see 
   [RFC3471]) and the LSP encoding type is Ethernet. 
    
2. Overview 
    
   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet link 
   type (switching granularity) of the requested LSP, and the MTU value 
   for the LSP. 
    
   As the Bandwidth Profile defines the set of traffic parameters 
   applicable to a sequence of Service Frames, these objects MAY also 
   include several bandwidth profile parameters such as: 
    
   - Committed Rate: defines the rate at which traffic commits to 
     be sent to the Ethernet LSP. The Committed Rate is described in 
     terms of the CIR (Committed Information Rate) and CBS (Committed 
     Burst Size) traffic parameters. 
     
     CIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time) 
     up to which the network is committed to transfer frames and 
     meets performance objectives. 
    
     CBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units 
     (e.g. bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the 
     interface speed to remain CIR-conformant. 
    
   - Excess Rate: defines the extent by which the traffic sent on a 
     Ethernet LSP exceeds the committed rate. The Excess Rate is 
     described in terms of the EIR (Excess Information Rate) and EBS 
     (Excess Burst Size) traffic parameters. 
    
     EIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time),

     in excess of the CIR, up to which the network may transfer 
     frames without any performance objectives. 
    
     EBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units 
     (e.g. bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the 
     interface speed to remain EIR-conformant. 
    
   - The color mode (CM) parameter indicates whether the "color- 
     aware" or "color-blind" property is employed by the bandwidth 
     profile. 
    
   - The coupling flag (CF) parameter allows the choice between two 
     modes of operations of the rate enforcement algorithm. 
    
3. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object  
    
   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by 
   IANA) has the following format: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

      This is a two-octet value indicating the MTU in octets. 
    
      The MTU MUST NOT take a value smaller than 46 bytes for Ethernet  
      v2 and 38 bytes for IEEE 802.3. 
    
   TLV: 
    
      The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object MUST include at least one TLV 
      and MAY include one or more than one optional TLV. 
    
      Each TLV has the following format: 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3

            Indicates the total length of the TLV, i.e., 4 + the length 
            of the value field in octets. A value field whose length is 
            not a multiple of four MUST be zero-padded (with trailing 
            zeros) so that the TLV is four-octet aligned.

            Value 0 is reserved. Values 1 through 127 are assigned by

   an upper bound on the volume of the expected service frames belonging 
   to a particular Ethernet service instance. 
    
   The Type 129 TLV has the following format:

   Profile: 8 bits (this field is to be registered by IANA) 
    
      This field is defined as a vector of binary flags. The following  
      flags are defined: 
    
         Flag 1 (bit 1): coupling flag (CF) 
         Flag 2 (bit 2): color mode (CM) 
    
      Where bit 1 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved, 
      they SHOULD be set to zero when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when   
      received. 
       
      A flag is set to one to indicate that the corresponding metering 
      is requested. 
    
      The Flag 1 allows the choice between two modes of operations of 
      the rate enforcement algorithm. 
    
      The Flag 2 indicates whether the color-aware or color-blind 
      property is employed by the bandwidth profile. When Flag 2 is set 
      to 0 (1), the bandwidth profile algorithm is said to be in 
      color blind (color aware) mode. 
    
   Reserved: 24 bits 
      
      These bits SHOULD be set to zero when sent and MUST be ignored 
      when received. 
    
   CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits

MEF Ethernet Traffic Parameters                               Feb 2006 
 
 
      The value of the CIR is in units of bytes per second. The CIR is 
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number 
      (see [RFC1832]). 
    
      The CIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0. 
    
   CBS (Committed Burst Size): 32 bits 
    
      The value of the CBS is in units of bytes. The CBS is encoded 
      as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
      [RFC1832]). 
    
      When CIR is strictly greater than 0 (CIR > 0), the CBS MUST be 
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size. 
    
   EIR (Excess Information Rate): 32 bits 
    
      The value of the EIR is in units of bytes per second. The EIR 
      is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point 
      number (see [RFC1832]). 
      
      The EIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0. 
    
   EBS (Excess Burst Size): 32 bits 
    
      The value of the EBS is in units of bytes. The EBS is encoded 
      as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
      [RFC1832]). 
    
      When EIR is strictly greater than 0 (EIR > 0), the EBS MUST be  
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size. 
    
4. Ethernet FLOWSPEC format 
    
   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by 
   IANA) has the same format as the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 
 
5. ADSPEC considerations 
    
   There is no ADSPEC associated with the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 
    
   Either the ADSPEC is omitted or an Int-serv ADSPEC with the Default 
   General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service fragment 
   is used, see [RFC2210]. 
    
6. Processing 
    
   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object carries the traffic specification

MEF Ethernet Traffic Parameters                               Feb 2006 
 
 
   generated by the RSVP session sender. The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC 
   object SHOULD be forwarded and delivered unchanged to both 
   intermediate and egress nodes. 
    
   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object carries reservation request information 
   generated by receivers. As with any FLOWSPEC object, the information 
   content of the Ethernet FLOWSPEC object flows upstream toward the 
   ingress node. 
    
   Intermediate and egress nodes MUST verify that the node itself and 
   the interfaces on which the LSP will be established can support the 
   requested Switching Granularity, MTU and values included in sub- 
   object TLVs. If the requested value(s) can not be supported, the 
   receiver node MUST generate a PathErr message with a "Traffic 
   Control Error/Service unsupported" indication (see [RFC2205]). 
    
   In addition, if the MTU field is received with a value smaller than 
   the minimum transfer unit size of the Ethernet frame (e.g. 46 bytes 
   for Ethernet v2, 38 bytes for IEEE 802.3), the node MUST generate a 
   PathErr message with a "Traffic Control Error/ Bad Tspec value" 
   indication (see [RFC2205]). 
 
7. Security Considerations 
    
   This document introduces no new security considerations to either 
   [RFC3473].   
    
   GMPLS security is described in section 11 of [RFC3471] and refers to 
   [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   Two values have been defined by IANA for this document: 
    
   Two RSVP C-Types in registry: 
         http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters 
    
      -  An Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object: Class = 12, C-Type = TBA (see 
         Section 3). 
    
      -  An Ethernet FLOWSPEC object: Class = 9, C-Type = TBA (see    
         Section 4).
