        Definition of Managed Objects for Performance Reporting
                     draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report
   generation on any device that supports MIBs containing counter and
   gauge objects for performance monitoring.  This allows a management
   station to instruct a device to build off-line reports to be
   collected asynchronously by the management station.  Further, this
   REPORT-MIB can be configured in a proxy configuration where the
   report generation is performed on a device in close network proximity
   to the device containing the referenced counter objects.  Hence, this
   capability allows network operators to reduce the SNMP polling
   traffic burden on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Disruption Tolerant Networks
   which is typical of SNMP performance management applications.

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous, off-
   line report generation for performance monitoring on any device
   supporting MIBs containing variables that resolve to type Integer32
   (i.e., Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks).  This REPORT-MIB
   allows for the report generation to occur on the same device as
   containing the referenced counter object or on a device in close
   network proximity to the device with the referenced counter object.
   This should be useful to devices or networks where efficient use of
   bandwidth is of concern or where intermittent connectivity is common.
   Hence, the REPORT-MIB is useful for devices managed over some Mobile
   Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) or Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs).

   The REPORT-MIB offers three types of off-line reporting.  One type
   offering reports which present statistical analysis of the objects
   being tracked; found within the reportStatsGroup.  The second type
   offering a means to collect sampled data related to defined MIB
   objects.  This second type of reporting is contained in the
   reportSampledGroup.  The third offering reports which present
   (collect) raw data values and their time of change from the objects
   being tracked; found within the reportHistoryGroup.

   For statistical reporting, the REPORT-MIB borrows from the RMON
   [RFC1757] ReportsControl and Reports Tables.  Here the
   reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup defines the capabilities of the device
   with respect performance monitoring and statistical analysis.  Some
   analysis is hard-coded into the definition of the
   reportStatsDataGroup while the device can also advertise extended
   statistical reporting via the reportMetricExtDefTable.  The
   reportsControlTable specifies the report metrics, the Object ID to
   monitor and other aspects of the statistical report development and
   storage.

   For the collection of sampled data, the REPORT-MIB draws directly
   from the usrHistoryGroup from RMON 2 [RFC2021].  Here the
   reportSampledControlTable allows the user to define aspects of the
   report for sampled data, including the number of MIB objects to be
   sampled and the nature of the sampling frequency and overall report
   duration.  This group uses the notion of buckets, which contained
   sampled data from a set of identified MIB objects sampled at the same
   time point.  The report consists of the buckets each containing sets
   of sampled data from the same MIB objects but at differing sampling
   times.  The reportSampledObjectTable allows the user to identify the
   multiple MIB objects to be sampled.  The reportSampledDataTable
   contains the storage of the reported sampled data contained within

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   buckets, one for each sampling instance.

   For the collection of raw data, the REPORT-MIB contains a
   reportHistoryGroup comprised of the reportHistoryControlTable for
   control of historical data reports and the reportHistoryDataTable for
   the storage of the historical reports.

   Various compliance groups which allow for development of raw data
   collection reports, collection of sampled data reports or only
   statistical data reports, or all combinations.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Reporting MIB references performance objects in other MIBs and
   generates offline performance reports on those referenced objects.
   The REPORT-MIB can be coincident with the other MIB or can reside on
   another device in close network proximity to the device containing
   the referenced performance related object.

4.1.  REPORT-MIB Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the Reporting MIB
   process.  First, the model for the reportStatsGroup is presented.
   Then the model for the reportSampledGroup and the reportHistoryGroup
   are presented.

   Figure 1 illustrates a potential use of the REPORT-MIB for the

   generation of off-line, remotely generated reports.  The management
   station on the left hand side of the illustration instructs the
   remote device to create reports through manipulation of the
   ReportCntrl Objects in the REPORT-MIB resident on the remote device.
   The reports instruct the device to monitor the status of specified
   counters (on other MIBs and potentially on other devices in close
   network proximity) periodically and to generate a set of metrics
   describing the temporal behavior of those counter values.  The
   reports are stored locally until the management station decides to
   pull them off the device.  The figure shows a case where the REPORT-
   MIB generates a notification that Report_2 has completed, prompting
   the management station to pull Report_2 from the device.

   The REPORT-MIB's reportStatsGroup defines specifically a set of
   metrics which are computed within all reports.  It also allows for
   the specification of metric extensions which are local to the
   specific implementation of the REPORT-MIB.  These are identified in
   the reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup metricExtension Table.

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   Each metric has an associated Object ID of type counter associated
   with it.  The control table specifies a report interval and a bin
   interval.  The report interval is an integral multiple of the bin
   interval.  For each bin interval, the device identifies the change in
   the counter value over the bin interval (called x_i) and then
   computes the associated metric, e.g., sum, sum of the square, etc,
   over the set {x_i}.  It maintains the sum of these computations
   within the metric objects in the 'reportStatsDataTable'.  Once the
   report interval is complete, the management station has enough
   information to compute a set of interesting and useful statistics.

   The computational model of the reportStatsGroup of the REPORT-MIB is
   illustrated in the figure below.  The important controls are a) the
   contrlInterval, b) the cntrlBinInterval, c) the specific
   counterObjectId, and d) the metric.  In the figure x_i represents the
   ith value of the counter change, i.e., x_i = counterValue(t_i+1) -
   counterValue(t_i).  The metrics reported are then computed from the
   set (x_i).  Three examples are identified in the figure, e.g.,
   StatSumX, StatSumSq and StatMaxX.  Other existing and potential
   metrics are discussed below.

        n = cntrlInterval / cntrlBinInterval

        StatSumX = Sum(x_i)  from i=0, ..., n-1
        StatSumSq = Sum((x_i)^2) from i=0, ..., n-1
        StatMaxX = Max(x_i) for i=0, ..., n-1

   This capability then allows for the computation of various
   significant statistics related to the behavior of the referenced
   object.

   o  Maximum and Minimum - the maximum and the minimum change in the
      referenced object during a single cntrlBinInterval during the
      cntrlInterval.

   o  Arithmetic Mean - the mean change in the referenced object over
      all control bin intervals during the cntrlInterval.  This is
      derived from the StatSumX quantity.

   o  Variance - the variance in the change of the referenced object
      over all control bin intervals within the cntrlInterval.  This is
      derived from the StatSumSq and the StatSumX quantities.

   These are accessible from the statistical datum provided by this MIB
   module.  Other statistics are derivable including, e.g., the slope of
   a least-squares fit to the rate of change of the referenced object.
   These are described below.

   The REPORT-MIB also provides for the collection of sampled data
   instead of statistical data.  It does this by importing (copying) the
   usrHistory group from RMON2 [RFC2021] which allows for the generation
   of reports collecting the sampled object values binned for the
   purpose of aggregation and efficiency of collection.  These are
   defined within the reportSampledGroup.  The model used for this type
   of report generation is based upon three tables.  The
   reportSampledControlTable defines aspects of the report generation
   related to duration of the reporting interval, the bin (or bucket)
   sizes for the report, and the number of object values collected for
   each bucket.  The reportUsrHistoryObjectTable identifies the specific
   MIB objects whose values and binned within the report.  And the
   reportSampledDataTable contains the binned data values collected for
   the report.

   The REPORT-MIB also provides for the collection of historical data
   instead of statistical or sampled data.  It does this by defining the
   reportHistoryControlTable for the control of the historical reports
   and the reportHistoryDataTable for the storage of the historical
   reports.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Capabilities - Objects related to the capabilities of the device
      and MIB implemented on the device.  Some objects are explicitly
      defined within the REPORT-MIB.  Other capabilities can be exposed
      through the REPORT-MIB, but which are not explicitly defined
      within this document.  These later capabilities include objects,
      e.g., for new metrics.

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   o  Control - Objects defined within this document which set the
      parameters for specific reports to be generated offline on the the
      remote managed device.

   o  Data - Objects which hold the report data, either statistical,
      sampled or raw history data.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the REPORT-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  reportMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the REPORT-MIB.

   o  reportMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the
      REPORT MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

   o

      *  Statistics Group - This group contains the objects which
         support the generation of reports of a statistical nature.

      *  Sampled Group - This group contains the objects which support
         the generation (collection) of reports exposing sampled data
         values.

      *  History Group - This group contains the objects which support
         the generation (collection) of historical reports exposing raw
         data values.

   o  reportMIBConformance - Defines a variety of conformance of
      implementations of this REPORT-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the REPORT-MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus textual convention is imported from RFC 2579 [RFC2579].

5.2.  The Statistics Group

   The REPORT-MIB Statistics Group contains objects which allows for the
   generation of statistical analysis reports.  For example, this group
   can be exercised to generate the mean and variance of the referenced
   counter object.  The Statistics Group is composed of:

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   o  reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup - lists the statistics collections
      capabilities of this device.  Certain statistics are mandatory,
      i.e., hard coded into the MIB definitions.  While, the
      capabilities group allows the developer to add additional
      statistical analysis capabilities.

   o  reportStatsControlGroup - allows the management application to
      define the parameters of the reports.

   o  reportStatsDataGroup - presents the data from the specified
      reports.

   As and example of how the metrics are to be computed within the
   REPORT-MIB, consider the standard metric object
   'reportStatsDataStatSumX'.  For each bin interval defined by the
   object reportCntrlReportsBinInterval, the change in the value of the
   counter pointed to by the Object ID reportCntrlReportsPriObjID is
   calculated.  Then this (delta) value is added to the current value of
   the value contained in the object 'reportStatsDataStatSumX'.  Then,
   if interested in computing the average change in this object (sampled
   each bin interval) for the duration of the report, the management
   station simply divides reportStatsDataStatSumX by
   reportStatsDataStatN.  Although this is a trivial example because the
   value of reportAggrReportStatSumX is simple the difference in the
   counter reportCntrolReportsPriObjID at the start and the end of the
   total report interval, the other metrics defined are not as trivial.

   The objects 'reportStatsDataOverflowStatSumX' and
   'reportStatsDataHCSumX' are borrowed from RMON [RFC2021] and exist to
   handle integer overflow situations where, e.g.,
   'reportStatsDataStatSumX' overruns its maximum vary numerous times.

   Computation of the least-square fit of the data collected for a
   report can be accomplished.  (NOTE: describe this capability here.)

5.3.  The Sampled Group

   The Sampled Group contains tables which allows for the development of
   reports based upon sampling the referenced counter objects at
   specified intervals.  The development of this group within the
   REPORT-MIB follows exactly the User History group from the RMON 2 MIB
   [RFC2021].  The Sampled Group is composed of:

   o  reportSampledControlTable - allows for the setting of the
      parameters of the report.

   o  reportSampledObjectTable - sets the referenced objects to be
      sampled during the test.  With this capability, the management

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


      application can reference multiple objects, all of which are
      sampled during the test and reported out through the
      reportSampledData Table.

   o  reportSampledDataTable - contains the reports.

5.4.  The History Group

   The History Group contains tables which capture information on change
   events for he referenced objects.  Depending upon the referenced
   objects, this could force the generation of large amounts of data.
   Care should be exercised when considering the use of this capability.

   o  reportHistoryControlTable - defines the parameters for the test.

   o  reportHistoryDataTable - presents the reports associated with the
      constructed tests.

5.5.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Sub-tree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the REPORT-MIB and their intended purpose or
   utility.  This group is currently empty.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The REPORT-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the RMON2-MIB

   The REPORT-MIB is closely related in many aspects to the RMON2-MIB
   [RFC2021].  Specifically, the reportSampledGroup is a direct copy of
   the RMON2 User History Group, with the names changed to comply with
   the naming conventions within the REPORT-MIB.  Further, the design
   and use of the control tables within the REPORT-MIB draw exactly from

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   the definition of this table structures in the earlier RMON MIBs.

6.3.  Relationship to the TPM-MIB

   The REPORT-MIB pulled the reportStatsGroup directory from the TPM-MIB
   [RFC4150].  The table structures and the choice of statistics draws
   directly from the earlier TPM-MIB developed within the RMON Working
   Group.

6.4.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following REPORT-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

--
-- Sampled Collection Group (reportSampledGroup)
--
-- The reportSampled group combines mechanisms seen in the alarm and
-- history groups to provide user-specified samplying collection,
-- utilizing two additional control tables and one additional data
-- table. This function has traditionally been done by NMS
-- applications, via periodic polling.  The reportSampled group allows
-- this task to be offloaded to a remote managed device.
--
-- Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object) is collected in the same
-- manner as any data table (e.g. etherHistoryTable) except
-- that the user specifies the MIB instances to be collected and their
-- sampling frequency. Objects are collected in
-- bucket-groups, with the intent that all MIB
-- instances in the same bucket-group are collected as atomically as
-- possible by the remote managed device.
--
-- The reportSampledControlTable is a one-dimensional read-create table.
-- Each row configures a collection of sampling buckets; the creation
-- of a row in this table will cause one or more associated instances in
-- the reportSampledObjectTable to be created. The user specifies the
-- number of bucket elements (rows in the reportSampledObjectTable)
-- requested, as well as the number of buckets requested.
--
-- The reportSampledObjectTable is a 2-d read-write table.
-- Each row configures a single MIB instance to be collected.
-- All rows with the same major index constitute a bucket-group.
--
-- The reportSampledTable is a 3-d read-only table containing
-- the data of associated reportSampledControlEntries. Each
-- entry represents the value of a single MIB instance
-- during a specific sampling interval (or the rate of
-- change during the interval).
--
-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be
-- stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid. This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.
--
-- Row Creation Order Relationships
--
-- The static nature of the reportSampledObjectTable creates
-- some row creation/modification issues. The rows in this
-- table need to be set before the associated
-- reportSampledControlEntry can be activated.

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such



Cole, et al.             Expires January 6, 2011               [Page 62]

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.




Cole, et al.             Expires January 6, 2011               [Page 63]

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' sub-tree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                    July 2010


   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.

11.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank Bert Wijnen and Andy Bierman for pointing out
   the existence of the usrHistory group within RMON2 and in answering
   our numerous questions on the usrHistory group.  Further, we wish to
   thank U. Herberg for his forcing additions to this MIB through his
   thoughtful consideration of performance monitoring requirements for
   other MIBs, e.g., NHDP and OLSR MIBs.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Changes from draft-cole-manet-report-mib-02 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-00 draft.

   1.  Major change was the incorporation of the IP address objects
       associated with all objects of type 'OBJECT IDENTIFIER'.  This
       allows the REPORT-MIB to exist as a proxy report generation
       capability on a device separate but in close proximity to the
       device monitoring the referenced object.

   2.  Cleaned up the up front text, reducing the repetition with the
       object descriptions in the MIB.

   3.  Worked on and added sections discussing the relationship to other
       MIBs.

   Changes from -01 to -02 draft.

   1.  Restructured the MIB somewhat to now offer the three reporting
       capabilities in increasing order of detail: a) statistical
       reports, b) sampled reports, and c) historical reports.

   2.  Renamed the usrHistoryGroup and elements to samplingGroup.  This
       is in line with its actual capabilities.

   3.  Added a new historyGroup which provides a history of change
       events.

   4.  Updated the4 Conformance section to reflect the above changes and
       additions.  But did not yet run smilint to check MIB syntax.

   Changes from -00 to -01 draft.

   1.  Added (copied) the usrHistory group from RMON2 into the REPORT-
       MIB.

   2.  Restructured the MIB to account for the inclusion of the
       reportSampledGroup.

   3.  Dropped the reportCurReportsTable as this did not make sense
       within the context of the REPORT-MIB.

   4.  Added the Compliance and Conformance material.  Defined several
       Compliance Groups to all for base implementations of the REPORT-
       MIB for only statistical reports, for only historical reports or
       for both.  Allow for enhanced implementations to address higher
       capacity issues and extension to metric reporting for statistical
       reporting.

   5.  Ran the MIB through the smilint checker and in the process
       corrected numerous typos, ommisions, TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS,
       IMPORTS, etc.

   6.  Updated main text to reflect changes.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the REPORT-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  Need to add an index associated with object IDs of interest which
       are contained within a table, e.g., IfPacketsIn in an
       InterfaceTable which is indexed by IfIndex.  (Note: I think added
       the IP address associated with the referenced object addresses
       this issue.)

   2.  Complete notification group.

   3.  Complete conformance group.  Done but not yet checked by smilint.

   4.  Update the text of the document to reflect the final state of the
       MIB.

   5.  Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
       DESCRIPTION clauses.

   6.  Complete the security analysis and section.

   7.  Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.
