Abstract

   The Landmark Routing Protocol (LANMAR) utilizes the concept of 
   "landmark" for scalable routing in large, mobile ad hoc networks.  
   It relies on the notion of group mobility: i.e., a logical group 
   (for example a team of coworkers at a convention) moves in a

   coordinated fashion. The network address of a node is <Group ID, 
   Host ID>.  A landmark is dynamically elected in each group.  The 
   route to a landmark is propagated throughout the network using a 
   Distance Vector mechanism.  Separately, each node in the network 
   uses a "scoped" routing algorithm (e.g., FSR) to learn about routes
   within a given (max number of hops) scope.  To route a packet to a
   destination outside its scope, a node will direct the packet to the
   landmark corresponding to the group ID of such destination.  Once 
   the packet is within the scope of the landmark, it will typically 
   be routed directly to the destination.  Remote groups of nodes are
   "summarized" by the corresponding landmarks.  The solution to 
   drifters (i.e., nodes outside of the scope of their landmark) is 
   also handled by LANMAR.  Landmark dynamic election enables LANMAR 
   to cope with mobile environments.  By using a "scoped" routing 
   scheme, we dramatically reduce routing table size and update 
   overhead in large nets.  LANMAR is well suited to provide an 
   efficient and scalable routing solution in large, mobile, ad hoc 
   environments in which group behavior applies and high mobility 
   renders traditional routing schemes inefficient.

1. Introduction                                                     

   This document describes the Landmark Routing Protocol (LANMAR) [1,2]
   developed by the Wireless Adaptive Mobility (WAM) Laboratory [4] at 
   University of California, Los Angeles.

   The concept of landmark routing was first introduced in wired area 
   networks [6].  The original scheme required predefined multi-level 
   hierarchical addressing.  The hierarchical address of each node 
   reflects its position within the hierarchy and helps to find a route
   to it.  Each node knows the routes to all the nodes within its 
   hierarchical partition.  Moreover, each node knows the routes to 
   various "landmarks" at different hierarchical levels.  Packet 
   forwarding is consistent with the landmark hierarchy and the path 
   is gradually refined from the top level hierarchy to lower levels 
   as a packet approaches its destination.

   LANMAR borrows the concept of landmark and extends it to the 
   wireless ad hoc environment.  LANMAR scheme does not require 
   predefined hierarchical address, but it uses the notion of landmarks
   to keep track of logical subnets in which the members have a 
   commonality of interests and are likely to move as a "group" 
   (e.g., brigade in the battlefield, colleagues in the same 
   organization, a group of students from same class, or a team of 
   co-workers at a convention and a tank battalion in the battlefield).

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol      November 17, 2000


   Each such logical group has an elected landmark.  For each group, 
   underlining "scoped" routing algorithm will provide a one-level 
   scope.  The routing update packets are restricted only within the 
   scope.  Accurate routing information for nodes within scope is 
   maintained.  The routing information to remote nodes (nodes outside
   the node's scope) is "summarized" by the corresponding landmarks. 
   Thus, the LANMAR scheme largely reduces the routing table size and 
   the routing update traffic overhead.  It greatly improves 
   scalability.

   In addition, in order to recover from landmark failures, 
   a "landmark" node is elected in each subnet.  Landmark election 
   provides a flexible way for the LANMAR protocol to cope with a 
   dynamic and mobile network.  The protocol also provides a solution 
   for drifters (Nodes that are outside the fisheye scopes of the 
   landmarks of their logical groups).  Extra storage, processing and 
   line overhead will be incurred for landmark election and drifter 
   bookkeeping.  However, the design of the algorithms provides 
   solutions without compromising scalability.  For example, the 
   routing overhead for handling drifters is typically small if the 
   fraction of drifting nodes is small.  More analysis is given in 
   Section 7.

   The LANMAR runs on top of a proactive routing protocol.  It also 
   requires that the underlining routing protocol support the scoped 
   subnetworking.  Fisheye State Routing Protocol (FSR) [7,8] is 
   such a protocol that supports LANMAR.  In FSR, the link state 
   protocol is used within the scope.  However, the fisheye scope 
   technique can also be applied to a distance vector type protocol,
   such as DSDV [3], in which the hop distance can be used to 
   bind the scope for routing message updating.  The main advantage of
   LANMAR is that the routing table includes only the nodes within the
   scope and the landmark nodes.  This feature greatly improves 
   scalability by reducing routing table size and update traffic O/H.

   Thus the Landmark Routing Protocol provides an efficient and 
   scalable routing solution for a mobile, ad hoc environment while 
   keeping line and storage overhead (O/H) low.  Moreover, the 
   election provides a much needed recovery from landmark failures.

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].


3. Protocol Applicability                 

3.1. Networking Context

   LANMAR is best suited for large scale mobile ad hoc wireless 
   networks.  The landmark scheme on top of "scoped" routing algorithm
   has large advantages in reducing routing update packet size and 
   keeping progressive accurate routes to remote nodes.  It achieves 
   high data packet to routing packet ratio.  Moreover, the fact that 
   the route error is weighted by distance obviously reduces the 
   sensitivity to network size.

   LANMAR is also suited for high mobility ad hoc wireless networks. 
   This is because in a mobility environment, a change on a link far 
   away from the source does not necessarily cause a change in the 
   routing table at the source and that all the information about 
   remote nodes is summarized by landmarks.

3.2. Protocol Characteristics and Mechanisms  

   * Does the protocol provide support for unidirectional links?(if so,
   how?)

        Yes.  Since LANMAR is on top of a host protocol, if the host 
        protocol supports unidirectional links, e.g., the FSR protocol,
        LANMAR can use the unidirectional link states as well.

   * Does the protocol require the use of tunneling? (if so, how?)
        No.

   * Does the protocol require using some form of source routing? (if
   so, how?)

        No.  

   * Does the protocol require the use of periodic messaging? (if so,
   how?)

        Yes.  The LANMAR periodically broadcasts landmark information 
        to its neighbors. But the updates are piggybacked in the host 
        routing update messages. 

   * Does the protocol require the use of reliable or sequenced packet
   delivery? (if so, how?)

        No.  As the packets are sent periodically, they need not be 
        sent reliably.

   * Does the protocol provide support for routing through a multi-
   technology routing fabric? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  It is assumed that each node's network interface is 
        assigned a unique IP address.
  
   * Does the protocol provide support for multiple hosts per router?
   (if so, how?)

        Yes. The router that has multiple hosts can use network ID of 
        these hosts as the address to participate LANMAR.

   * Does the protocol support the IP addressing architecture? (if so,
   how?)

        Yes.  Each node is assumed to have a unique IP address (or
        set of unique IP addresses in the case of multiple interfaces).
        The LANMAR references all nodes/interfaces by their IP address.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol      November 17, 2000


        This version of the LANMAR also supports IP network addressing
        (network prefixes) for routers that provide access to a 
        network of non-router hosts.

   * Does the protocol require link or neighbor status sensing (if so,
   how?)

        No. 

   * Does the protocol have dependence on a central entity? (if so,
   how?)

        No.  

   * Does the protocol function reactively? (if so, how?)

        No.         

   * Does the protocol function proactively? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  The LANMAR proactively maintains landmark information 
        at each node.  

   * Does the protocol provide loop-free routing? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  As the protocol uses routing paths learned from the host 
        protocol for in-scope destinations, if the host protocol 
        provides loop-free routing, so does LANMAR.  For out-scope 
        destinations, only routes to landmarks are used.  Because these
        routes are DSDV, it is loop free.  When a packet is 
        approaching the destination, in-scope routes are used again. 

   * Does the protocol provide for sleep period operation?(if so, how?)

        Yes.  However, this requires TDMA MAC layer support.  The 
        router can be scheduled to sleep during idle periods.

   * Does the protocol provide some form of security? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  When a node broadcasts routing update message, only 
        entries of in-scope nodes and landmarks are included.  This 
        will prevent other remote nodes from being heard.

   * Does the protocol provide support for utilizing multi-channel,
     link-layer technologies? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  In fact, the multi-channel can be used to separate 
        routing messages from user data packets.

4. Protocol Overview 

4.1. Protocol Descriptions

   As mentioned in Section 1, the landmark concept we adopt here uses 
   the notion of logical subnets in which the members have a 
   commonality of interests and are likely to move as a "group".  
   Each logical subnet has one node serving as a "landmark" of that 
   subnet.  The protocol requires that the landmark of each subnet have
   the knowledge of all the members in its group.  The LANMAR protocol 
   also uses a scope at each node.  The size of the scope is a 
   parameter measured in hop distance.  It is chosen in such a way that
   if a node is at the center of a subnet, the scope will cover the 
   majority of the subnet members.  If the shape of a subnet is likely 
   to be a cycle, the center node's scope will cover all the members of
   the subnet.  If this center node is elected as a landmark, it 
   fulfills the requirement of the protocol.  If a landmark does not 
   locate at the center, there will be some members drifting off 
   its scope.  The landmark will keep records for these drifters.

   The LANMAR relies on an underlining proactive protocol with the 
   ability of providing "scoped" routing.  The LANMAR itself is a 
   distance vector type protocol.  Each node maintains a distance 
   vector for landmarks of all the subnets and a distance vector for 
   drifters in its subnet.  The distance vectors for landmarks and 
   drifters are exchanged through piggybacking in the periodical 
   routing update packets (link state or distance vector) of the 
   underling routing protocol.  The size of the landmark distance 
   vector equals to the number of logical subnets and thus landmark 
   nodes.  Both sizes of the two distance vectors are small.

   The routing update scheme uses the "scoped" routing algorithm.  
   The main idea is summarized below.  Each node broadcasts routing 
   information periodically to its immediate neighbors.  In each 
   update packet, the node sends routing table entries within its 
   scope and also piggybacks the landmark and drifter distance 
   vectors.  Sequence numbers are used in LANMAR update packets. 
   Each node advances its sequence number before sending an update 
   packet.  Through the exchange process, the table entries with 
   larger sequence numbers replace the ones with smaller sequence 
   numbers.

   Let's take, for example, the FSR as our host protocol.  For nodes 
   within the scope, the updating is in a certain frequency.  But 
   for nodes beyond the scope, the update frequency is reduced to 
   zero;  Only the update frequency of the landmark nodes remains 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                       [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol      November 17, 2000


   unaltered.  As a result, each node maintains accurate routing 
   information for in-scope nodes and keep routing directions to the 
   landmark nodes for out-scope nodes, or say, for remote groups.  
   A packet directed to a remote destination initially aims at the 
   landmark of that remote group; as it gets closer to the landmark, 
   it may eventually switch to the accurate route to the destination 
   provided by in-scope nodes of the destination.

4.2. Landmark Election

   Dynamic election/re-election of landmark node is essential for 
   LANMAR to work in a wireless mobile environment.  Basically, each 
   node tracks other nodes of its group in its scope and computes  
   "weight", e.g. the number of the nodes it has found.  At the 
   beginning of the LANMAR, no landmark exists.  Protocol LANMAR 
   only uses the host protocol functionality.  As host routing 
   computation progresses, one of the nodes will learn (from 
   the host protocol's routing table) that more than a certain number 
   of group members (say, T) are in its scope.  It then proclaims 
   itself as a landmark for this group and adds itself to the landmark
   distance vector.  The node broadcasts the landmark information to
   the neighbors jointly with the host update packets.  

   When more than one node declares itself as a landmark in the same 
   group, as the landmark information floods out, each node will 
   perform a winner competition procedure.  Only one landmark for each
   group will survive and it will be elected.  To avoid flapping 
   between landmarks (very possible in a mobile situation), we use 
   hysteresis in the replacement of an existing landmark.  I.e., the 
   old Landmark is replaced by the new one only if its weight is, say 
   less than 1/2 of the weight of the current election winner.  Once 
   ousted, the old leader needs the full weight superiority to be 
   reinstated.

   This procedure is carried out periodically in the background (low 
   overhead, anyway).  At steady state, a landmark propagates its 
   presence to all other nodes like a sink in DSDV.  It is extremely 
   simple and it converges (by definition).  In a mobile environment, 
   an elected landmark may eventually lose its role.  The role shifting
   is a frequent event.  In a transient period, there exist several 
   landmarks in a single group.  The transient period may be actually 
   the norm at high mobility.  This transient behavior can be 
   drastically reduced by using hysteresis. 

   When a landmark dies, its neighbors will detect the silence after 
   a given timeout.  The neighbors of the same group will then take 
   the responsibilities as landmarks and broadcast new landmark 
   information.  A new round of landmark election then floods over

   the entire network.

4.3. Drifters

   Typically, all members in a logical subnet are within the scope of 
   the landmark, thus the landmark has a route to all members.  It may
   happen, however, that some of the members "drift off" the scope, 
   for example, a tank in a battalion may become stranded or lost. 
   To keep track of such "drifters", i.e., to make the route to them 
   known to the landmark, the following modification to the routing 
   table exchange is necessary.  Each node, say i, on the shortest 
   path between a landmark L and a drifter l associated with that 
   landmark keeps a distance vector entry to l.  Note that if l is 
   within the scope of i, this entry is already included in the 
   routing table of node i.  When i transmits its distance vector to 
   neighbor, say j, then j will retain the entry to member l only if 
   d(j,l) is smaller than the scope or d(j,L) is smaller than d(i,L). 
   The latter condition occurs if j is on the shortest path from i 
   (and therefore from l) to L.  This way, a path is maintained from 
   the landmark to each of its members, including drifters.

   The occurrences of drifters are dynamic in a mobile network.  In 
   order to timely remove the staled drifter information, the time 
   when a node detects itself a drifter is propagated with the 
   distance vector.


5. Protocol Specifications            

   This section discusses the operation of LANMAR routing protocol.  
   The sending and receiving of landmark updates are in the proactive 
   nature.  The routing packets are processed separately from 
   ordinary data packets. 
                               
5.1. Data Structures    

   Each node has a unique "logical" identifier defined by a subnet 
   field and a host field.  The host field is unique in the subnet and
   might in fact coincide with the physical address.  The "logical" 
   identifier can also be an IP address when the subnet address can 
   logically group the nodes.  Moreover, each node keeps a landmark 
   status as part of identifier.  As LANMAR runs on top of a host 
   routing protocol, it shares the underlining data structures. 
   Particularly, LANMAR requires the underlining data structures to 
   associate a landmark status with each node's identifier.  In 
   addition, LANMAR keeps a drifter list and a landmark distance 
   vector.

5.1.1. Landmark Status

   Each node has not only a "logical" identifier, which basically is 
   its address, but also a landmark status.  The status includes 
   a flag which indicates whether the node is a landmark or not and a
   weight (the number of group members the node detects within its 
   scope).  Anywhere in the tables of the host protocol, when a 
   node's address is kept, a landmark status is recorded.  The status
   is piggybacked in the periodical routing update packets of the 
   host protocols together with the node address.  There are two 
   fields for a status:
   - Landmark flag
   - Number of group members in its scope
 
5.1.2. Landmark Distance Vector 

   Landmark distance vector (LMDV) gives the next hop information to 
   all landmarks in the network.  Every subnet has an entry in LMDV. 
   Initially, the entries in the underlining routing table, which 
   point to landmarks, are copied to LMDV.  The LMDV entries are 
   updated when landmark update message is received or underlining 
   topology table is changed.  LMDV functions as a part of the 
   routing table.  It has the following fields:
   - Landmark status
   - Next hop address
   - Distance

5.1.3. Drifter List
 
   The drifter list of LANMAR provides the next hop information to 
   forward the packets to the drifters known to the current node. 
   The entries are updated explicitly using landmark update message. 
   It works as a part of routing table.  The drifter list (DFDV) has 
   following fields:
   -  Destination drifter address
   -  Next hop address
   -  Last declaration time

5.2. LANMAR Update Message Format

   The messages necessary for LANMAR protocol are piggybacked in the 
   host periodic update packets.  The format given below is not 
   exactly how the bits appear in the host update packets.  Where to 
   put these fields in the host update packets is an implementation 
   issue.  The necessary fields include current node's landmark 
   status (assuming that the node's address can be obtained from IP 
   header), its landmark distance vector LMDV and the drifter list 
   DFDV.  The next two subsections will describe how these

5.2.1. Description of the fields

   Landmark Flag and N_members 
      
      These two fields are the landmark status.  N_members is the 
      number of group members in the node's scope.

   Reserved

      The bits are set to '0' and are ignored on reception.

   N_landmarks

      The number of entries of the landmark distance vector.

   Landmark Address 1, Next Hop Address 1, N_members 1 and Distance 1 

      The first entry in the landmark distance vector.  
      Landmark Address 1 and N_members 1 are the destination landmark
      status.  
      Next Hop Address 1 and Distance 1 is the next hop and distance

      to the landmark.

      These fields are repeated N_landmarks times for each entry in 
      landmark distance vector.

   N_drifters

      The number of entries of the drifter list.

   Drifter Address 1, Next Hop Address 1, Distance 1, Timestamp 1

      The first entry in the drifter list. 
      Next Hop Address 1 and Distance 1 are the next hop and distance 
      to the Drifter Address 1.  
      Timestamp 1 is the time when the node becomes a drifter.

      These fields are repeated N_drifters times for each entry in 
      the drifter list.

   The length of the message (including the host update fields) is
   limited to the maximum IP packet size.  In that case, multiple 
   packets may be required to broadcast all the topology entries for 
   host protocol.  The landmark distance vector and drifter list will 
   be piggybacked in each packet with the same sequence number.

5.3. Processing Landmark Updates

   Landmark update information is a part of the LANMAR periodic 
   routing update message, which is carried in host updating packets. 
   The update information includes sender's landmark status and LMDV. 
   Landmark update message is used for landmark election and helps 
   nodes build their LMDV.
  
5.3.1. Originating a Landmark in a Subnet
  
   Every time a node detects a topology change, it recalculates the 
   number of group members in its scope.  The new number of group 
   members is recorded in its landmark status and replaces the old 
   values in all the tables containing the landmark status.  If this 
   number is greater than a threshold T, the node qualifies as a 
   landmark only when there is no landmark for the group according to
   its LMDV, or it wins the election when competing with the existing 
   landmark.  The landmark distance vector is updated accordingly.  
   If the host protocol has new shortest paths to landmarks, the new 
   paths are copied from the host routing table to the LMDV.  
   The landmark status and the LMDV will be broadcast to neighbors 
   with the next host update packet.

5.3.2. Receiving Landmark Updates 

   When a node receives a landmark update message, it compares its 
   LMDV entries with the incoming LMDV entries for each subnet.  New 
   landmark enrties will be copied.  Competing landmarks will 
   be solved through a winner competition algorithm.  The winner will 
   be elected as the landmark for the subnet.  The node's landmark 
   status and LMDV will be updated according to the outcomes of the 
   competition.  The distance information can be obtained either from 
   the incoming LMDV entry or from host routing table.  The updated 
   LMDV and the node's landmark status will be propagated jointly with
   the host routing update packets.

5.3.3. Winner Competition

   When more than one node declares itself as a landmark in the same 
   group, a simple solution is to let the node with the largest 
   number of group members win the election and in case of tie, 
   lowest ID breaks the tie.  The other competing nodes defer.  
   However, this method is likely to cause the oscillation of 
   landmark roles between nodes. 

   To use hysteresis in replacing an existing landmark, let us assume 
   the competing node's number of members is M, the existing 
   landmark's number of members is N and a factor value S.  When M is 
   greater than N*S, then the competing node replaces the existing 
   landmark.  Or, when N reduces to a value smaller than a threshold T,
   then it gives up the landmark role.  A tie occurs when M falls 
   within an interval [N*1/S, N*S], then the node with larger member 
   number wins the election.  If a tie occurs again with equal member 
   number, i.e., M equals to N, it is broken using lowest ID.  A tie 
   can always be broken using lowest ID as the address is used as ID 
   and it is unique. 

5.4. Processing Drifter Updates

   Drifter update information is a part of the LANMAR periodical 
   routing update message, which is carried in host updating packets. 
   The update information is the drifter list (DFDV) of the sender.  
   The computation of the DFDV at each node includes checking the node
   itself to see whether it is a drifter and recording paths to other 
   drifters.

5.4.1. Originating a Drifter Entry
 
   By checking the distance to the landmark of its group, each node 
   easily knows whether it has become a drifter.  If the distance is 
   larger than the scope, the node will put itself into its drifter 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                      [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol      November 17, 2000


   list and record the time instance.  This drifter information 
   will be sent back to the landmark hop by hop along the shortest 
   path to it which can be learned from the LMDV.  For each drifter, 
   only the node on its shortest path to the landmark needs to receive
   its information, so before the entry is broadcast, the next hop to 
   landmark is attached with its entry.  The DFDV will be propagated 
   with the next host routing update packet.

5.4.2. Receiving Drifter Updates

   Upon receiving an update packet, the DFDV part is retrieved and 
   processed.  If an entry of incoming DFDV indicates that the current
   node is its next hop to the landmark, i.e., the current node is on 
   the drifter's shortest path to the landmark, the current node will 
   insert or update its drifter list.  The node sending the update 
   packet is recorded as the next hop to the drifter.  The reverse path
   to the drifter is thus built up.  The procedure ends when the 
   landmark receives the drifter entry.  The updated DFDV will be 
   propagated with the next host routing update packet.


6. Data Packet Forwarding 

   Data packets are relayed hop by hop.  The host protocol routing 
   table, drifter list and landmark distance vector are looked up 
   sequentially for the destination entry.  If the destination is 
   within a node's scope, the entry can be found directly in the 
   routing table and the packet is forwarded to the next hop node. 
   Otherwise, the drifter list DFDV is searched for the destination. 
   If the entry is found, the packet is forwarded using the next hop 
   address from DFDV.  If not, the logical subnet field of the 
   destination is retrieved and the LMDV entry of the landmark 
   corresponding to the destination's logical subnet is searched.  
   The data packet is then routed towards the landmark using the next 
   hop address from LMDV.  The packet, however, is not necessary to 
   pass through the landmark.  Rather, once the packet gets within the
   scope of the destination on its way towards the landmark, it is 
   routed to the destination directly.


7. Discussion about Storage and Processing Overhead for Drifters

   The routing storage and processing overhead introduced by the 
   distance vector extension to handle drifters is typically small 
   if the fraction of drifting nodes is small.  Consider a network 
   with N nodes and L landmarks, and assume that a fraction F of the
   members of each logical subnet have drifted.  In the worst case, 
   the path length from landmark to drifter is the square root of N 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                      [Page 15]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol      November 17, 2000


   (assuming a grid topology).  Thus, sqrt(N) is the bound on the 
   number of extra routing entries required at the nodes along the 
   path to the drifter.  The total number of extra routing entries is
   sqrt(N)*L*(F*N/L) where N/L is the average logical group size. 
   Thus, the extra storage per node is F*sqrt(N).  Now, let us assume
   that the number of nodes in the scope = # of landmarks = logical 
   group size = sqrt(N).  Then, the basic routing table overhead per 
   node (excluding drifters) is 3*sqrt(N).  Thus, the extra overhead 
   caused by drifters is F/3.  If 20% of the nodes in a group are 
   outside of the landmark scope, i.e., have drifted, the extra 
   routing O/H required to keep track of them is only 7%.
