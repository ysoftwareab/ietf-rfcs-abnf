Abstract

   This document specifies a syntax for addressing time intervals within
   time-based Web resources through URI queries and fragments. It
   suggests a Best Current Practice (BCP) for any time-based Web
   resource for which temporal subparts may be requested and retrieved.
   This enables, e.g., direct access to a clip of a video stored on a
   Web Server, or direct jumps to a specific event within a piece of
   music. The syntax is not restricted to audio or video Web resources,
   but covers all kinds of Web resources that contain time-continuous
   information.

Internet-Draft           Time intervals in URIs            December 2003


   The URI query specification of this syntax implies that a Web server
   is capable to extract the given time subsections from the Web
   resource and serve that as another complete Web resource of the same
   type. Specifying a time point or interval through a URI fragment in
   contrast does not deliver a subpart of the Web resource - instead it
   is up to the application and the resource type as to what action is
   invoked. Examples are a fast forward to a time point, or a zoom into
   a time interval.

   This document is a proposal for a Best Current Practice. The authors
   strongly encourage anybody interested to explore the implementation
   of the syntax on different types of Web resources and contribute any
   findings. Current implementations work with Annodex [6] and CMML [7]
   format Web resources over HTTP. An implementation over e.g. RTP/RTSP
   for Internet streaming and for other protocols has not been explored
   yet. The syntax is also being explored within the ISO/MPEG
   standardisation body for addressing into MPEG-4 or MPEG-7 format
   resources. Also note that RealNetworks is using an different syntax
   for the query case for RealMedia over RTP/RTSP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

1. Introduction

   Many resources on the World Wide Web represent information that
   relate to a timeline of events. Time-sampled recordings of sound,
   temporally interleaved audio-visual streams, or data files containing
   time series data are examples. This document describes a syntax for
   addressing temporal offsets and time intervals in such resources. The
   aim is to make it simple to incorporate infrastructure into the Web/
   Internet which supports the addressing and retrieval of temporal
   subparts of time-based Web resources, as well as the automated
   processing of such subparts e.g. for reusing them.

   Files containing commands for creating time-continuous experiences
   (such as SMIL files for authoring interactive multimedia, or VRML
   files for authoring 3D worlds) cannot be addressed in this manner -
   however, if one particular user interaction (i.e. one experience) is
   recorded, the recording contains information that relates to a single
   timeline and can be addressed with the manner described in this
   specification.

2. Incorporating temporal addressing into the Generic URI Scheme

   The Generic URI Scheme [2] defines two manners in which subparts of
   Web resources can be addressed: queries and fragments. Queries are
   given through extending the Web resource's address by a string that
   is separated through the special character "?".  Fragments are given
   through extending the Web resource's address by a string that is
   separated through the special character "#".

   RFC 2396 [2] specifies that URI queries identify a resource and thus
   a Web server has to process the query returning a fully defined
   resource. There is no generically defined structure to URI queries.
   However, the format of a CGI query string where name-value pairs are
   separated by the special character "&" is a commonly used format. The
   Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a standard for external gateway
   programs to interface with information servers such as HTTP servers
   (see http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/). When defining a common manner
   in which temporal subparts of a Web resource can be addressed, it is
   important to be compatible with this common CGI format.

   RFC 2396 [2] also specifies that URI fragments identify a secondary
   resource by reference to a primary resource and that fragments get
   interpreted client side, i.e. the Web infrastructure consisting of
   Web servers and Web proxies will generally ignore the "#" extension
   of URIs. This basically implies that a fragment provides a particular
   view on a resource and the view is defined through the type of
   resource and the client side application.

   Both, URI query and URI fragment identifiers have traditionally been
   defined for specific media types or even specific services. This is
   especially true for URI queries where the query string may consist of
   name-value pairs that contain the particular fields and field entries
   of a particular form that resides on a particular server and gets
   processed by a particular server extension. For the temporal
   addressing that is proposed in this document, it is important that
   every Web server that interpretes the query parameter reacts
   uniformly to it. The particular resources which are covered in this
   manner are however not defined in this document - when a media type
   gets registered for the Web/Internet, the authors must explicitly
   define if a Web resource of that media type can be addressed through
   the time-interval URI addressing scheme defined here.

3. Temporal addressing through URI queries

   URI query strings are specified after the special character "?".  A
   temporal query parameter defines one or more intervals of time.  Time
   is given with respect to specific time schemes. The default time
   scheme is "npt" (normal play time), in which a time point is
   specified in seconds through a floating point number with an
   arbitrary temporal resolution. The available time schemes and their
   specifications are described further down in this document.

   The BNF for a temporal URI query parameter is:

   temporal-parameter = "t" "=" [ timescheme ":" ] temporal-intervalspec

   temporal-intervalspec = temporal-interval ["," temporal-intervalspec]

   temporal-interval = timespec ["-" timespec]

   timescheme     = *unreserved

   timespec       = *uric

   All temporal intervals actually specify start and end times.  If no
   end timespec is given, it defaults to infinity, which for a file
   means the end of the file or for a stream the end of the stream.
   Overlapping temporal intervals MUST be interpreted by merging the
   intervals into one.

   It is not valid to give several temporal URI query parameters.  They
   all need to be wrapped into a single specification.

   Examples are:

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx?t=15.2 --- video.anx is transferred
      from 15.2 seconds into video.anx to the end of the file/stream.

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx?t=15.2-18.7 --- video .anx is
      transferred from 15.2 seconds into video.anx to 18.7 seconds.

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx?t=15.2-18.7,23 --- video.anx is
      transferred from 15.2s to 18.7s and from 23s to the end of the
      file/stream.

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx?t=15.2-18.7,17.4-30.1 -- video.anx is
      transferred from 15.2 seconds into video.anx to 30.1 seconds.

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx?t=15.2-18.7&t=23 --- invalid query
      parameters - MUST create an error message.

4. Temporal addressing through URI fragments

   URI fragment specifiers are given after the special character
   crosshatch ("#"). A temporal URI fragment defines a specific temporal
   view onto a Web resource consisting of one or more intervals of time.
   Again, time is given with respect to specific time schemes as defined
   below. Again, the default is "npt".

   The BNF for a temporal URI fragment identifier is (reusing the
   temporal-intervalspec of the URI query section above):

   temporal-fragment = [ timescheme ":" ] temporal-intervalspec

   As with temporal URI query parameters, all temporal intervals are
   specified through start and end times, the default end time being
   infinity, which may map to the end of a file or stream. Also, several
   temporal URI fragment identifiers are not allowed.

   Examples are:

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx#15.2 --- specifies a view on the
      section between 15.2 seconds into video.anx and the end of the
      file/stream.

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx#15.2-18.7 --- specifies a view on the
      section between 15.2s and 18.7s of video.anx.

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx#15.2-18.7,23 --- specifies a view on
      the section between 15.2s and 18.7s, as well as 23s to the end of
      the file/stream.

   o  http://www.foo.bar/video.anx#15.2-18.7,17.4-30.1 -- specifies a
      view on the section between 15.2s and 30.1s of video.anx.

5. Time schemes

   A time scheme is a short identifier for a type of time specification.
   The following general time schemes are specified in this document.
   Further time schemes are expected to emerge and should probably be
   registered through IANA.

   o  "npt" (Normal Play Time; base of seconds as used in the RTSTP
      standard [3])

   o  "smpte" (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers time
      codes as specified in the SMPTE time and control code standard
      [4])

   o  "utc" (Universal Time Code giving wall-clock time as specified in
      the ISO 8601 standard [5]).

   Specification as BNF:

   timescheme = npt-timescheme | smpte-timescheme | utc-timescheme
   timespec   = npt-timespec | smpte-timespec | utc-timespec

   Thus, the available time schemes are:

      NPT time has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as
      H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes,
      S=second and h=fractions of a second. Negative values are not
      allowed.

      Specification as BNF:

   npt-timescheme = "npt"
   npt-timespec   =  npt-sec | npt-hhmmss
   npt-sec        =   1*DIGIT [ "." *DIGIT ]
   npt-hhmmss     =   npt-hh ":" npt-mm ":" npt-ss [ "." *DIGIT ]
   npt-hh         =   1*DIGIT
   npt-mm         =   1*2DIGIT
   npt-ss         =   1*2DIGIT

      SMPTE time codes [4] are optimized for frame level accuracy.
      SMPTE is specified as HH:MM:SS:FF, where HH=hours, MM=minutes,
      SS=second, FF=frames. The drop-frame algorithms for calculating
      the exact times can be found in the references SMPTE standard.
      Negative values are not allowed.

      "smpte-24=" SMPTE time with a 24 fps basis

      "smpte-24-drop=" SMPTE time with a 24/1.001 fps basis

Internet-Draft           Time intervals in URIs            December 2003


      "smpte-25=" SMPTE time with a 25 fps basis

      "smpte-30=" SMPTE time with a 30 fps basis

      "smpte-30-drop=" SMPTE time with a 30/1.001 fps basis

      "smpte-50=" SMPTE time with a 50 fps basis

      "smpte-60=" SMPTE time with a 60 fps basis

      "smpte-60-drop=" SMPTE time with a 60/1.001 fps basis

      Specification as BNF:

   smpte-timescheme = "smpte-24" | "smpte-24-drop" | "smpte-25" |
                      "smpte-30" | "smpte-30-drop" | "smpte-50" |
                      "smpte-60" | "smpte-60-drop"
   smpte-timespec   = smpte-hh ":" smpte-mm ":" smpte-ss [ ":" *2DIGIT ]
   smpte-hh         = 1*2DIGIT
   smpte-mm         = 1*2DIGIT
   smpte-ss         = 1*2DIGIT

      UTC time has a second or subsecond resolution.  It is given as
      YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.hhZ, where Y=year, M=month, D=day, H=hour,
      m=minute, s=second, h=subseconds (one-hundredth of a second).

      Specification as BNF:

   utc-timescheme = "clock"
   utc-timespec   = utc-date "T" utc-hhmmss "Z"
   utc-date       =   8DIGIT
   utc-hhmmss     =   6DIGIT [ "." *DIGIT ]

   Examples for time-interval URI specifications with different time
   schemes are:

   http://www.foo.bar/audio.anx?t=smpte-25:10:07:33:06-10:07:55:00
     (for a temporal interval between 36453.25s - 36475s)
   http://www.foo.bar/audio.anx#npt:10:7:33.25
     (for a temporal interval between 36453.25s and the end of the file/stream)
   http://www.foo.bar/audio.anx?t=clock:20021107T173045.25Z
     (for Thu Jul 11 05:30:45 UTC 2002 and a quarter seconds)

   The semantic interpretation of time specifications given with any of
   the schemes depends on the resource. With every resource there are
   two associated timebases: a UTC timebase which may e.g. specify the
   creation time of the resource, and a playback timebase used for
   display in a user agent while viewing the resource.

Internet-Draft           Time intervals in URIs            December 2003


   The playback timebase of a resource defaults to 0 seconds if the
   resource has no other timebase associated with it. For example, with
   professional video production, the first frame of video of a program
   normally refers to a SMPTE timebase of 01:00:00:00, not 00:00:00:00.
   This practice arose from the requirements of program production and
   analog videotape recording technology, and it has subsequently become
   a uniform, almost ironclad practice worldwide. Associating such a
   practice to a digital video resource requires a way to store that
   timebase with the resource, which may or may not be possible,
   depending on the content type of the resource.

   Examples: If a resource has an associated timebase of 3600 seconds,
   and the given temporal fragment offset is 4000 sec, a seek time 400
   sec into the resource is requested. If the timebase is given as clock
   time 20001010T142211.23Z and the temporal offset specified is
   20001010T145511.23Z, the time 33 minutes into the resource is
   requested.

   The UTC timebase of a resource defaults to non-specified. Associating
   such a UTC timebase with a resource requires a way to store that
   timebase with the resource. For example, for a resource that is a
   file on a server, it may be chosen to be the time of storage of that
   resource.

   The semantic interpretation of temporal intervals depends on the time
   scheme. Unless specified differently, the temporal intervals given
   are closed intervals, i.e. they start at the first time point and
   finish at the second time point: [time_from;time_to]. For SMPTE
   timecodes, however, it is conventional to express such temporal
   intervals as IN and OUT times for editing. Thus, the IN time
   specifies the first frame that is included in the interval and the
   OUT time specifies the first frame that is not included in the
   interval. Therefore, a SMPTE interval is specified as
   [time_from;time_to[, which explains the additional frame in the above
   example.

6. Intended usage

   The temporal URI interval specifications are intended to be used on
   resources that represent a specific timeline. An example of such
   resources are most resources of MIME types "audio/*" and "video/*".

   A retrieval action on a URI that includes a temporal URI query
   parameter MUST result in a time-continuous resource that is reduced
   to the given temporal intervals. As per HTTP standard, if the URI
   including the temporal query parameter cannot be resolved by the
   server, the server has to return a "404" error message.
   Time-continuous resources often come with high bandwidth
   requirements, so serving out only the queried time interval avoids
   unnecessary network load. For example, a 1 hour Digital Video (DV
   format) requires about 25 GB (MPEG-2 reduces that to about 3 GB). It
   also ignificantly reduces the delay for the user agent for receiving
   relevant data.

6.1 Rollout with HTTP

   Servers that support the temporal query format MUST implement a
   retrieval action of time-continuous resources with such query
   specifications by serving the requested resource from the temporal
   offset onwards. For many time-continuous resources - especially when
   in compressed format - this means that the server has to parse the
   structure of the resource and construct another valid resource from
   the original resource's header information and data frames. If a
   server cannot perform the fragment offset, it MUST return an error as
   otherwise the user agent cannot identify if the offset action was
   performed or not.

   It is expected that over time more servers and client applications
   understand and handle the temporal URI query parameters and thus
   enable direct networked access to content in time-continuous
   resources. Also Web proxies may begin to understand such temporal
   offsets and can exploit them for caching.

6.2 Rollout with RTP/RTSP

   [TBD]

7. Security considerations

   This specification does not create any new security issues beyond the
   ones already specified for URIs in RFC 2396 [2].

8. ChangeLog

   draft-pfeiffer-temporal-fragments-01:

      Extension of the number of available SMPTE time-schemes. Many
      thanks to Bill Miller and Oliver Morgan of the SMPTE for their
      input on these changes.

      Deleted "start" and "now" as time specification values.

      Extension of the temporal fragment addressing to also address
      temporal intervals, not only time points.

      Added section that includes some key points of discussion where
      the existing URI standard contradicts the use of fragments for
      time-continuous data.

   draft-pfeiffer-temporal-fragments-02:

      Full compatibility with existing URI standard specification is
      achieved by using both, query and fragment specifications for
      addressing.

      Restriction of specification to http scheme (Web) only, as usage
      on other protocols (such as rtp/rtsp) still needs to be explored.

      All addressing is interval based because an offset really implies
      a view onto the document from that point onwards.

Appendix A. Acknowledgements

   The authors greatly acknowledge the contributions of Andre Pang and
   Andrew Nesbit in developing this syntax. We also thank Bill Miller
   and Oliver Morgan of the SMPTE for their contributions and Dave
   Singer from Apple Computer Inc. for his.

   The many comments on this document from the URI discussion group at
   the W3C (uri@w3.org), especially the comments from Larry Masinter, Al
   Gilman and Martin Duerst and others have strongly shaped the current
   format.

   Many thanks also to the Audio/Video Transport working group at the
   IETF (avt@ietf.org), foremost to Magnus Westerlund, for picking up
   the discussion around how to use the scheme on RTP/RTSP. This is now
   not covered in this document, but should be explored in the future,
   possibly in a different document.

   Last but not least thanks go to the ISO/MPEG working group with whom
   harmonisation in addressing formats is still pursued - thanks to Ian
   Burnett, Myriam Amielh, Ernest Wan, and Gerrard Drury.
