QCLASS=*

         Special procedures are required when the QCLASS of the query is
         "*".  If the database contains several classes of data, the
         query processing steps above are performed separately for each
         CLASS, and the results are merged into a single response.  The
         name error condition is not meaningful for a QCLASS=* query.
         If the requestor wants this information, it must test each
         class independently.

         If the database is limited to data of a particular class, this
         operation can be performed by simply reseting the authoritative
         bit in the response, and performing the query as if QCLASS was
         the class used in the database.

QNAME=10.IN-ADDR.  It would receive two RRs in response:

           10.IN-ADDR           PTR  IN MILNET-GW.ISI.ARPA   
           10.IN-ADDR           PTR  IN GW.MIT.ARPA          

QTYPE=PTR, QCLASS=IN, QNAME=6.0.0.10.IN-ADDR, and would receive:

           6.0.0.10.IN-ADDR     PTR  IN MULTICS.MIT.ARPA
