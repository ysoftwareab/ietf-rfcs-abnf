1. Introduction 
    
   The SIP INFO method was defined in [RFC2976] to convey session 
   related control information inside an Invite-created dialog.  While 
   it has been widely adopted for specific application use cases, and a 
   couple RFCs rely on it, there are known limitations and issues with 
   it today documented in [info-harmful].  Some of those issues, 
   dealing with negotiation of use and context indication, are 
   addressed in [info-events].   
    
   At IETF 70, the SIP WG chairs asked for a list of use-cases, for the 
   purpose of deciding if a general framework such as [info-events] is 
   warranted.  This draft lists such use-cases, based on email 
   discussion on the SIP WG mailing list sip@ietf.org.  This draft is 
   NOT suggesting the use-cases are legitimate or proper for SIP INFO 
   use - that is to be discussed on the SIP WG mailing list. 
    
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
    
3. Applicability 
    
   This draft relates to the [RFC2976] SIP INFO request. 
    
    
4. Alternative Mechanisms 
    
   In general, most use-cases for INFO have alternative mechanisms, 
   which may or may not be more appropriate.  Examples are: 
    
     1. Use Re-INVITE or UPDATE requests - for some cases this may make 
        sense, but there is a question if INVITE or the [RFC3311] 
        UPDATE method should be used as just carriers for things not 
        affecting/updating the state of the session/dialog or SDP. 
        (note that session-timers uses them for this though)  For 
        example, in some systems INVITE and UPDATE are treated 
        differently for Call-Detail-Records and logging. 
      
     2. Use MESSAGE request - the MESSAGE request, defined in 
        [RFC3428], is considered to be generally useful for sending 
        MIME body content to be rendered for human users.  It requires 
        support for text/plain bodies, and is commonly expected to 
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - August 2008                [Page 3] 
                          SIP INFO Use Cases             February 2008 
 
 
        handle message/cpim bodies, but it could transport any body 
        type.  There is an argument that MESSAGE is for human-rendered 
        info, so vcards and vcalendars are inappropriate.  However one 
        could argue both are in fact rendered to the user, after 
        processing based on their type, but that some UA's can offer to 
        skip rendering and do something else with them, again based on 
        their type (like email clients do). 
      
     3. Use SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY - [RFC3265] was written to handle 
        scenarios similar to some of the use-cases listed herein. 
      
     4. Use a media-plane protocol, such as RTCP or MSRP - several use-
        cases in this draft should clearly be handled in the media-
        plane.  Potentially any use-case could in theory be done by 
        media, but clearly for some doing so represents a huge amount 
        of overhead. 
    
    
5. Documented Uses of INFO 
    
5.1. SIP-T 
    
   This is documented in [RFC3372], which is a BCP.  
    
5.2. ISUP/QSIG Interworking and Exchange 
    
   This is documented in [ECMA-355].  
 
5.3. Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) 
    
   This is documented in [RFC5022], which is Informational.  
    
5.4. User-Agent Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications 
    (uaCSTA) 
    
   This is documented in [ECMA-TR/87].  
    
    
6. Potentially Valid Use-Cases  
    
   The following represent known or potential use-cases which this 
   author believes have reasonable applicability to INFO use. 
    
6.1. DTMF 
    
   Several proprietary uses of INFO for transferring DTMF are known to 
   exist, some of which are in wide use by multiple vendors.   
   Alternative mechanisms: [KPML] for signaling-plane, or [RFC4733] for 
   media-plane if possible.

                          SIP INFO Use Cases             February 2008 
 
 
    
6.2. Sending a vcard asynchronously 
    
   Example: Alice calls Bob, Alice says "can you send me John's 
   vcard?", Bob clicks something and voila it's sent.  
    
   Reasons for INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you send the 
   vcard, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, and 
   you can send it based on user input. Making it explicit means the 
   receiving UA can automatically store the vcard for later use, for 
   example into a contact list. 
    
   Alternative mechanisms: send a re-INVITE or UPDATE with a Call-Info, 
   with either a URL reference, data URI, or MIME and CID URL; send a 
   MESSAGE request. 
    
   Counter-Arguments to alternative mechanisms: sending it in an 
   INVITE/UPDATE Call-Info would conflict with the purpose of that 
   header being for caller/cllee information only (as opposed to third 
   party info, which this example shows).  Furthermore, the DATA URL is 
   generally discouraged, and a URL reference is hard to actually do in 
   practice.   
 
6.3. Sending a user-icon image 
    
   Example: Alice Alice calls Bob, Bob has an icon that represents 
   himself, sends it when he picks up the phone or upon clicking what 
   image he wants to represent himself.  
    
   Reasons for INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you send the 
   image, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it and 
   its type (jpeg/gif/bmp/etc.), and you can send it based on user 
   input.  Making it explicit means the receiving UA can automatically 
   store the image for later use, for example as a contact/buddy image, 
   which sending it in a MESSAGE would not do. 
    
   Alternative mechanisms: send a 200-ok, re-INVITE or UPDATE with a 
   Call-Info, which has an explicit type for "icon"; send a MESSAGE 
   request.  P. Kyzivat notes MESSAGE is appropriate.  J. Rosenberg 
   notes that if the image is big, which it easily could be, media-path 
   makes more sense. 
 
6.4. Sending a vcalendar invitation 
    
   Example: Alice calls Bob, Bob says "hey let's have a con call at 
   time X", clicks and voila his phone sends a vcalendar. 
    
   Reasons for INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you send the 
   vcalendar, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, 
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - August 2008                [Page 5] 
                          SIP INFO Use Cases             February 2008 
 
 
   and you can send it based on user input.  Making it explicit means 
   the receiving UA can automatically store the calendar invite time, 
   for example if it has an integrated calendar app or alarm reminder. 
    
   Alternative mechanisms: send a MESSAGE request. 
    
   [Editor's note: Whether the vcalendar is related to the session or 
   not and thus whether it should be sent in an in-dialog request or 
   not is certainly debatable, and makes MESSAGE more reasonable.] 
    
6.5. Sending an HTTP URL 
    
   Example: Alice calls Bob, a sales guy; Alice asks for more info or a 
   datasheet and Bob sends a URL for Alice to open with her web-
   browser. 
    
   Reasons for INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you send the 
   URL, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, and 
   you can send it based on user input.   
    
   Alternative mechanisms: send a MESSAGE request. J. Rosenberg notes 
   this can be done with a REFER with http URL based on [app-
   framework]. 
 
6.6. Performing a session traceroute 
    
   Example: Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice does a sip-traceroute 
   to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info with an incrementing 
   max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not really the Max-
   Forwards header), with a sip-frag type response body or some such. 
   The reason it's not just using the Max-Forwards is because the 483 
   response generated by normal proxies would terminate the dialog.  
   This wiould be a new header similar in concept, but only work for 
   middle-boxes which support it and don't generate a 483. 
    
   Reasons for INFO: If such a thing were to be defined, it could be 
   done such that the response code did not terminate the dialog. 
    
   Alternative mechanisms: re-INVITE or UPDATE. 
    
   [Editor's note: It's debatable if certain types of B2BUA's (ie, 
   SBCs) would ever allow this type of thing to happen, due to security 
   concerns, but I think they may do it at domain boundary hops.] 
 
6.7. Sending soft-key labels and press events 
    
   Example: Alice calls her vmail server.  Vmail server sends softkey-
   labels for the menu items available in the response or INFO, Alice 
   presses softkeys and her UA sends them in INFO.  
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - August 2008                [Page 6] 
                          SIP INFO Use Cases             February 2008 
 
 
    
   Reasons for INFO: similar to DTMF, the probability of users actually 
   pressing the soft-key buttons is very low, so using INFO reduces 
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY overhead and ties it to the INVITE dialog 
   implicitly. 
    
   Alternative mechanisms: SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY similar to [KPML]. 
   [Note: J. Rosenberg notes this in the [app-framework] draft scope] 
 
6.8. Sending geo-location information during call 
    
   Example: Alice calls Bob, a hotel receptionist.  Alice asks for 
   directions to hotel, clicks button and sends him location info of 
   her phone (or Bob clicks button and sends her his location).  Or 
   Alice calls emergency services from a mobile phone, and phone 
   updates location based on GPS. 
    
   Reasons for INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you send the 
   geo-loc, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, 
   and you can send it based on user input. 
    
   Alternative mechanisms: send a re-INVITE or UPDATE with geo-loc 
   info, or SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY. 
    
   [Editor's note: There is general agreement there is no need for this 
   to be done in INFO] 
 
 
7. Other Known Use-Cases 
    
   These use-cases are known to exist or have been proposed.   
    
7.1. Sending RTP/RTCP statistics during call 
    
   There is an implementation of this, and the rationale is the 
   signaling plane box that wants this info is not actually the media 
   plane box that gets RTCP.   
   [Editor's note: There is general agreement this should be done with 
   Sub/Not, so it can get stats after the call is over, and since it 
   will probably want periodic reports the overhead of the Subscribe 
   should be dwarfed by the number of Notifies] 
    
7.2. Sending access-location information after call establishment 
    
   There is a P-Access-Network-Info header, and some have proposed to 
   send an update for it as a phone roams access points or cells.   
   [Editor's note: I think this is an odd thing to do inside an Invite 
   session, vs. in a Sub/Not or Register (and besides most of the time 
   the "network" inserts this header, not the UA).]

                          SIP INFO Use Cases             February 2008 
 
 
    
7.3. Sending media-control indications 
    
   This sends play/pause/resume commands in INFO.  This is done today 
   by at least one vendor.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for 
   hold, except at a media content layer above RTP and even RTCP, so 
   not done in RTCP nor SDP. 
   [Editor's note: There is general agreement this should be done in 
   the media-plane.] 
   [J. Rosenberg agrees and notes: "There is a requirement for low 
   latency here and there will be a lot of these that get sent."] 
    
7.4. Sending video fast update command 
    
   This is an informational draft [fast-update], which documents what 
   has been implemented, but states it should really be done in the 
   media plane in the future. 
   [Editor's note: There is general agreement the draft is correct in 
   stating it should be done in the media-plane and not INFO] 
    
7.5. Sending peripheral control commands 
    
   There is actually a patent on this.  Someone thinks it makes sense 
   to create a SIP session to your laptop, or vice-versa, and then send 
   USB commands inside MIME in INFO messages.   
   [Editor's note: There is general agreement this should be media-
   plane, if anything.] 
    
7.6. Sending charging information for a call 
    
   There was a proposal to use this for Advice of Charge information in 
   TISPAN.   
   [Editor's note: IMO it should be a SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY model, as they 
   want this to survive the Invite session.] 
    
7.7. Sending a screen-pop-up message 
    
   There is a patent for doing screen pop-ups using INFO.  One could 
   use MESSAGE, but I believe the patent is for generating screen pop-
   ups like warnings and such, not simple user instant messages. 
   [P. Kyzivat notes this should be MESSAGE] 
    
7.8. Sending Bookmark Tags 
    
   There is a proposal in TISPAN and ATIS to indicate bookmark spots 
   for video streams using INFO. 
    
   [Editor's note: this seems like a media-plane thing, but the reason 
   they're using SIP is due to media layer processing issues, I think,

                          SIP INFO Use Cases             February 2008 
 
 
   whereby the media is processed by a different box than media 
   control?] 
    
7.9. Sending Hook-Flash Indication 
    
   There is a draft for doing this in [hook-flash], which is deployed.  
   This is along the lines of needing signaling-plane flash indication 
   a la DTMF.  RFC 2833 included it for media-plane DTMF events, but 
   [RFC4733] deprecated it. 
    
   [Editor's note: although hook-flash is sometimes considered similar 
   to DTMF, from a user perspective it's really just a overloaded 
   "button" for hold, transfer, or conference invocation and thus 
   should be handled by the UA natively] 
    
7.10.     Session Refresh and Liveness Check 
    
   This is actually implemented by several vendors: use INFO to check 
   the session is still alive (and keep it so).  This is clearly what 
   [RFC4028] was written for, which uses re-INVITEs and UPDATEs. 
    
7.11.     Message-Waiting Indication (MWI) 
    
   The idea is to set/clear the MWI light/icon on phones, but to do so 
   it sends INFO outside of dialogs.  This is implemented by several 
   vendors.  [Editor's note: This really should be done with 
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.] 
    
7.12.     Media Server Markup Language (MSML) 
    
   This is a deployed mechanism "used to control and invoke many 
   different types of services on IP Media Servers", documented in 
   [MSML].  
    
 
8. Security Considerations 
    
   There are no security considerations, since this is merely an 
   informative use-case document.
