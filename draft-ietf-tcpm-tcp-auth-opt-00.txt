Abstract 

   This document specifies a TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) which is 
   intended to replace the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC-2385 (TCP 
   MD5). TCP-AO specifies the use of stronger Message Authentication

   Codes (MACs) and provides more details on the association of security 
   associations with TCP connections. TCP-AO assumes an external, out-
   of-band mechanism (manual or via a separate protocol) for session key 
   establishment, parameter negotiation, and rekeying, replicating the 
   separation of key management and key use as in the IPsec suite. The 
   result is intended to be a simple modification to support current 
   infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect BGP and LDP, and 
   to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other system and 
   operational changes. TCP-AO uses a new option identifier, even though 
   it is intended to be mutually exclusive with TCP MD5 on a given TCP 
   connection. It supports IPv6, and is fully compatible with 
   requirements under development for an update to TCP MD5.

1. Introduction 

   The TCP MD5 Signature (TCP MD5) is a TCP option that authenticates 
   TCP segments, including the TCP IPv4 pseudoheader, TCP header, and 
   TCP data. It was developed to protect BGP sessions from spoofed TCP 
   segments which could affect BGP data or the robustness of the TCP 
   connection itself [RFC2385][RFC4953]. 

   There have been many recently-documented concerns about TCP MD5. Its 
   use of a simple keyed hash for authentication is problematic because 
   there have been escalating attacks on the algorithm itself [Be05] 
   [Bu06].  TCP MD5 also lacks both key management and algorithm 
   agility. This document proposes to add the latter, but suggests that 
   TCP should not be the framework for cryptographic key management. 
   This document replaces the TCP MD5 option to become a more general 
   TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), to support the use of other, 
   stronger hash functions and to provide a more structured 
   recommendation on external key management. The result is compatible 
   with IPv6, and is fully compatible with requirements under 
   development for an update to TCP MD5 [Be07]. 

   This document is not intended to replace the use of the IPsec suite 
   (IPsec and IKE) to protect TCP connections [RFC4301][RFC4306]. In 
   fact, we recommend the use of IPsec and IKE, especially where IKE's 
   level of existing support for parameter negotiation, session key 
   negotiation, or rekeying are desired. TCP-AO is intended for use only 
   where the IPsec suite would not be feasible, e.g., as has been 
   suggested is the case for some routing protocols, or in cases where 
   keys need to be tightly coordinated with individual transport 
   sessions [Be07]. 

   Note that this option is intended to obsolete the use of TCP MD5, 
   although a particular implementation may support both for backward 
   compatibility. For a given connection, only one can be in use. TCP 
   MD5-protected connections cannot be migrated to TCP-AO, since TCP MD5 
   does not support any changes to a connection's security configuration 
   once established.

1.1. Executive Summary 

   This document replaces TCP MD5 as follows [RFC2385]: 

   o  Uses a separate option Kind for TCP-AO (TBD-IANA-KIND). 

   o  Allows TCP MD5 to continue to be used for other connections. 

   o  Replaces MD5's one implicit MAC algorith with two prespecified 
      MACs (TBD-WG-MACS), and allows other MACs at the implementer's 
      discretion. 

   o  Allows rekeying during a TCP connection, assuming that an out-of-
      band protocol or manual mechanism coordinates the change of key 
      and that incorrectly keyed segments are ignored. In such cases, a 
      key ID may be used to make key selection more efficient. 

   o  Provides more detail in how this option interacts with TCP's 
      states, event processing, and user interface. 

   o  Proposed option is 4 bytes shorter (14 bytes overall, rather than 
      18) in the default case (assuming a 96-bit MAC, TBD-WG-MACLEN). 

   This document differs from other proposals to update TCP MD5 as 
   follows [Bo07][We05][We07]: 

   o  Fully compatible with requirements currently under development. 

   o  Does not support dynamic parameter negotiation. 

   o  Does not support in-band session key negotiation. 

   o  Does not support in-band session rekeying. 

   o  Does not require additional timers. 

   o  Always authenticates the the segment pseudoheader, header, and 
      data. 

   o  Provides more detail in how this option interacts with TCP's 
      states, event processing, and user interface. 

   o  Proposed option is 2 bytes shorter (14 bytes overall, rather than 
      16) in the default case (assuming a 96-bit MAC, TBD-WG-MACLEN) 

   o  Does not expose the MAC algorithm in the header.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

   o  Does not require a key ID; it allows for one where key overlap is 
      desired to support efficient rekeying. 

   o  Supports TCP over either IPv4 or IPv6. 

   This document differs from an IPsec/IKE solution as follows 
   [RFC4301][RFC4306]: 

   o  Does not support dynamic parameter negotiation. 

   o  Does not require a key ID (SPI), but does allow one. 

   o  Does not protect from replay attacks. 

   o  Forces a change of connection key when a connection restarts, even 
      when reusing a TCP socket pair (IP addresses and port numbers) 
      [Be07]. 

   o  Does not support encryption. 

   o  Does not authenticate ICMP messages (some may be authenticated in 
      IPsec, depending on the configuration). 

1.2. List of TBD Items  

   [NOTE: to be omitted upon final publication as RFC] 

   The following items are to be determined (TBD) prior to publication. 
   Once a value is chosen, it should be replaced for the notation below 
   throughout this document and the item removed from this list. 

   TBD-IANA-KIND  new TCP option Kind for TCP-AO, assigned by IANA 

   TBD-WG-MACS    list of default required MAC algorithms 

   TBD-WG-MACLEN  default length of MAC used in the TCP-AO MAF 

1.3. List of currently pending issues and to-do items 

   [NOTE: to be omitted upon final publication as an RFC] 

   o  Should the KeyID field always be present, or is the odd/even 
      solution currently described preferred? 

   o  Should TCP options be a list (as currently specified), all-or-none 
      (i.e., a single bit), or always included (i.e., non-configurable)?

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

   o  Which two MAC algorithms should be required as default? Should one 
      be set as the primary default? 

   o  Should the TSAD have a flag indicating use of the KeyID field (as 
      is currently defined), or should a KeyID=0 in the TSAD indicate 
      that no key is being used? 

   o  Should TCP-AO include a negotiation protocol with a backoff, i.e., 
      to allow non-TCP-AO endpoints to connect more quickly (or is this 
      a security problem)? Note that this would be useful only where a 
      rapid failure is useful, or where the TCP might backoff and use 
      another mode (e.g., TCP MD5 or no authentication). 

   o  Should the TSAD include entries for TCP MD5, or should that 
      protocol be deprecated implicitly and thus not supported per se by 
      this document? 

   o  TO-DO: Add a discussion of the use with manual keys, esp. for 
      connections with dynamic source ports. 

   o  TO-DO: Fix change to STATUS that makes it write-mode; current TCP 
      STATUS is read-only. 

   o  TO-DO: Review need for LISTEN instructions. 

1.4. Changes from Previous Versions 

   [NOTE: to be omitted upon final publication as RFC] 

1.4.1. New in draft-ietf-tcp-auth-opt-00 

   o  List of TBD values, and indication of how each is determined. 

   o  Changed TCP-SA to TCP-AO (removed 'simple' throughout). 

   o  Removed proposed NAT mechanism; cited RFC-3947 NAT-T as 
      appropriate approach instead. 

   o  Made several changes coordinated in the TCP-AUTH-DT as follow: 

   o  Added R. Bonica as co-author. 

   o  Use new TCP option Kind in the core doc. 

   o  Addresses the impact of explicit declines on security. 

   o  Add limits to TSAD size (2 <= TSAD <= 256).

   o  Allow 0 as a legitimate KeyID. 

   o  Allow the WG to determine the two appropriate required MAC 
      algorithms. 

   o  Add TO-DO items. 

   o  Added discussion at end of Introduction as to why TCP MD5 
      connections cannot be upgraded to TCP-AO. 

1.4.2. New in draft-touch-tcp-simple-auth-03 

   o  Added support for NAT/NAPT. 

   o  Added support for IPv6. 

   o  Added discussion of how this proposal satisfies requirements under 
      development, including those indicated in [Be07]. 

   o  Clarified the byte order of all data used in the MAC. 

   o  Changed the TCP option exclusion bit from a bit to a list. 

1.4.3. New in draft-touch-tcp-simple-auth-02 

   o  Add reference to Bellovin's need-for-TCP-auth doc [Be07]. 

   o  Add reference to SP4 [SDNS88]. 

   o  Added notes that TSAD to be externally implemented; this was 
      compatible with the TSAD described in the previous version. 

   o  Augmented the protocol to allow a KeyID, required to support 
      efficient overlapping keys during rekeying, and potentially useful 
      during connection establishment. Accommodated by redesigning the 
      TSAD. 

   o  Added the odd/even indicator for the KeyID. 

   o  Allow for the exclusion of all TCP options in the MAC calculation. 

1.4.4. New in draft-touch-tcp-simple-auth-01 

   o  Allows intra-session rekeying, assuming out-of-band coordination. 

   o  MUST allow TSAD entries to change, enabling rekeying within a TCP 
      connection.

   o  Omits discussion of the impact of connection reestablishment on 
      BGP, because added support for rekeying renders this point moot. 

   o  Adds further discussion on the need for rekeying. 

1.5. Summary of RFC-2119 Requirements 

   [NOTE: a summary will be placed here prior to last call] 

2. The TCP Simple Authentication Option 

   The TCP Simple Authentication Option (TCP-AO) uses a new TCP option 
   Kind value, (TBD-IANA-KIND).  

2.1. Review of TCP MD5 Option 

   For review, the TCP MD5 option is shown in Figure 1. 

                +---------+---------+-------------------+ 
                | Kind=19 |Length=18|   MD5 digest...   |

                +-------------------+ 
    
                 Figure 1 Current TCP MD5 Option [RFC2385] 

   In the current TCP MD5 option, the length is fixed, and the MD5 
   digest occupies 16 bytes following the Kind and Length fields, using 
   the full MD5 digest of 128 bits [RFC1321]. 

   The current TCP MD5 option specifies the use of the MD5 digest 
   calculation over the following values in the following order: 

   1. the TCP pseudoheader (IP source and destination addresses, 
      protocol number, and segment length) 

   2. TCP header excluding options and checksum 

   3. TCP data 

   4. connection key

2.2. TCP-AO Option 

   The new TCP-AO option is intended to be a superset of the TCP MD5 
   capability, and to be minimal in the spirit of SP4 [SDNS88]. TCP-AO 
   uses a new Kind field, and similar Length field to TCP MD5, and is 
   shown in Figure 2. 

                +--------------------+---------+-----------------... 
                | Kind=TBD-IANA-KIND | Len=var |      MAF...     ... 
                +--------------------+---------+-----------------... 
    
                      Figure 2 Proposed TCP-AO Option 

   The TCP-AO defines the following fields: 

   o  Kind: An unsigned field indicating the TCP-AO Option. TCP-AO uses 
      a new Kind value=TBD-IANA-KIND. Because of how keys are managed 
      (see Section 3), an endpoint will not use TCP-AO for the same 
      connection where TCP MD5 is used. 

   o  Length: An unsigned 8-bit field indicating the length of the TCP-
      AO option in bytes, including the Kind and Length fields.  
       
      >> The Length MUST be greater than or equal to 2.  
       
      >> The Length value MUST be consistent with the TCP header length; 
      this is a consistency check and to avoid overrun/underrun abuse.  
       
      Values of 2 and other small values are of dubious utility (e.g., 
      for MAC=NONE, or for very short MACs) but not specifically 
      prohibited. See the MAF description for implications of odd/even 
      lengths. 

   o  MAF: The MAF is a Message Authentication Field. Its contents are 
      determined by the particulars of the security association, where 
      there are two possible variants. When the Length is even, the 
      option appears as in Figure 3. When the Length is odd, the option 
      appears as in Figure 4. 

                +--------------------+---------+-------------------+ 
                | Kind=TBD-IANA-KIND | Len=var |      MAC          |

                ...-----------------+---------+ 
    
                  Figure 4 TCP-AO MAF with key identifier 

      Typical MACs are 96-128 bits (12-16 bytes), but any length that 
      fits in the header of the segment being authenticated is allowed. 
      Because typical MACs are even-length, TCP-AO assumes so [RFC4306]. 
      If a particular MAC is odd-length, it is padded. 

      >> An odd-length MAC MUST be padded with a single 0x00 byte on 
      transmit. Setting this pad byte is considered part of the 
      authentication algorithm. 

      >> An odd-length MAC MUST have a trailing 0x00 pad byte on 
      receipt. Checking this pad byte is considered part of the 
      authentication algorithm. 

      When the Length is odd, a key identifier (KeyID) is included in 
      the last byte of the option. The KeyID is used to support 
      efficient key rollover during a connection and/or to help with key 
      coordination during connection establishment, and will be 
      discussed further in Sections 3. 
       
      >> TCP-AO MUST support TBD-WG-MACS; other MACs MAY be supported 
      [RFC2403]. 

      >> A single TCP segment MUST NOT have more than one TCP-AO option. 

   The MAC is computed over the following fields in the following order: 

   1. the TCP pseudoheader: IP source and destination addresses, 
      protocol number and segment length, all in network byte order, 
      prepended to the TCP header below. The pseudoheader is exactly as 
      used for the TCP checksum in either IPv4 or IPv6 
      [RFC793][RFC2460]:

   TCP-AO by default includes the TCP options because these options are 
   intended to be end-to-end and some are required for proper TCP 
   operation (e.g., SACK, timestamp, large windows). Middleboxes that 
   alter TCP options en-route are a kind of attack and would be 
   successfully detected by TCP-AO. In cases where the configuration of 
   the connection's security association state indicates otherwise, the 
   TCP options can be excluded from the MAC calculation. 

   The TCP-AO option does not indicate the MAC algorithm either 
   implicitly (as with TCP MD5) or explicitly. The particular algorithm 
   used is considered part of the configuration state of the 
   connection's security association and is managed separately (see 
   Section 3). 

3. Security Association Management 

   TCP-AO relies on a TCP Security Association Database (TSAD). TSAD 
   entries are assumed to exist at the endpoints where TCP-AO is used, 
   in advance of the connection: 

   1. TCP connection identifier (ID), i.e., socket pair - IP source 
      address, IP destination address, TCP source port, and TCP 
      destination port [RFC793]. TSAD entries are uniquely determined by 
      their TCP connection ID, which is used to index those entries. 

      >> There MUST be no more than one matching TSAD entry per 
     direction for a TCP connection ID. 

   2. For each of inbound (for received TCP segments) and outbound (for 
      sent TCP segments) directions for this connection (except as 
      noted): 

       a. TCP option Kind exclusion list. A list of TCP option Kind 
          values, indicating that TCP options are excluded from all MAC 
          calculations. When empty, all TCP options are included. The 
          special value 0x00, normally indicating the end of the TCP 
          options list, indicates that all options are excluded (rather 
          than indicating them all). 

          >> The TCP option Kind exclusion list MUST default to empty 
          (i.e., no options excluded). 

          >> The TCP option Kind exclusion list MUST NOT change during a 
          TCP connection.

       b. An ordered list of zero or more connection key tuples. Each 
          tuple is defined as the set <[KeyID], MAC type, key length, 
          connection key> as follows: 
           
          >> TSAD key tuple components MUST NOT change during a 
          connection. 
           
          >> The set of TSAD key tuples MAY change during a connection, 
          but KeyIDs of those tuples MUST NOT overlap. I.e., tuple 
          parameter changes MUST be accompanied by key changes. 

           i. KeyID (optional). A single byte used to differentiate 
               overlapping Connection keys. 
                
               >> If the KeyID is not present for any key tuple, it MUST 
               be the only key tuple. 
                
               >> When an KeyID not used, the sender MUST use the key 
               from the first key tuple returned, and the receiver MUST 
               try all key tuples in order until one succeeds. 
                
               >> A TSAD implementation MUST support at least two KeyIDs 
               per connection per direction, and MAY support up to 256. 
                
               >> A KeyID MAY have the value of 0.

          ii. MAC type. Indicates the MAC used for this connection, as 
               per IKEv2 Transform Type 3 [RFC4306]. This includes the 
               MAC algorithm (e.g., HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, UMAC, etc.) and 
               the length of the MAC as truncated to (e.g., 96, 128, 
               etc.).  
                
               >> A MAC type of NONE MUST be supported, to indicate that 
               authentication is not used in this direction; this allows 
               asymmetric use of TCP-AO.  
                
               >> At least one direction (inbound/outbound) SHOULD have 
               a non-NONE MAC in practice, but this MUST NOT be strictly 
               required by an implementation.  
                
               >> When the outbound MAC is set to values other than 
               NONE, TCP-AO MUST occur in every outbound TCP segment for 
               that connection; when set to NONE or when no tuple 
               exists, TCP-AO MUST NOT occur in those segments. 
                
               >> When the inbound MAC is set to values other than NONE, 
               TCP-AO MUST occur in every inbound TCP segment for that 
               connection; when set to NONE or when no tuple exists, 
               TCP-AO SHOULD NOT be added to those segments, but MAY 
               occur and MUST be ignored. 

         iii. Key length. A byte indicating the length of the 
               connection key in bytes.  

          iv. Connection key. A byte sequence used for connection 
               keying, this may be derived from a separate shared key by 
               an external protocol over a separate channel. This 
               sequence is used in network standard byte order in MAC 
               calculations. 

   It is anticipated that TSAD entries for TCP connections in states 
   other than CLOSED can be stored in the TCP Control Block (TCB) or in 
   a separate database (see Section 5.1 for notes on the latter); TSAD 
   entries for pending connections (in passive or active OPEN) may be 
   stored in a separate database. This means that in a single host there 
   should be only a single database which is consulted by all pending 
   connections, the same way that there is only one set of TCBs. 
   Multiple databases could be used to support virtual hosts, i.e., 
   groups of interfaces. 

   Note that TSAD and the TCP-AO fields may omit use of the KeyID on a 
   per-connection configuration basis; the TCP connection ID already 
   uniquely specifies the TSAD entry, so a separate field is not needed 
 
 
Touch                    Expires May 11, 2008                 [Page 14]

   to specify a key unless key overlap during rekeying is supported or 
   is needed for key coordination during connection establishment (see 
   Section 5). The TCP-AO fields omit an explicit algorithm ID; that 
   algorithm is already specified by the TCP connection ID and stored in 
   the TSAD. 

   Also note that this document does not address how TSAD entries are 
   created by users/processes; it specifies how they must be destroyed 
   corresponding to connection states, but users/processes may destroy 
   entries as well. It is presumed that a TSAD entry affecting a 
   particular connection cannot be destroyed during an active connection 
   - or, equivalently, that its parameters are copied to TSAD entries 
   local to the connection (i.e., instantiated) and so changes would 
   affect only new connections. The TSAD could be managed by a separate 
   application protocol, and can be stored in a separate database if 
   desired. 

4. TCP-AO Interaction with TCP 

   The following is a description of how TCP-AO affects various TCP 
   states, segments, events, and interfaces. This description is 
   intended to augment the description of TCP as provided in RFC793 
   [RFC793]. 

4.1. User Interface 

   The TCP user interface supports active and passive OPEN, SEND, 
   RECEIVE, CLOSE, STATUS and ABORT commands. 

   >> TCP OPEN, or the sequence of commands that configure a connection 
   to be in the active or passive OPEN state, MUST be augmented so that 
   a TSAD entry can be configured.  

   >> New TSAD entries MUST be checked against a table of previously 
   used TSAD entries, and key reuse MUST be prohibited. 

   Users are advised to not inappropriately reuse keys [RFC3562].  

   >> TCP STATUS SHOULD be augmented to allow the TSAD entry of a 
   current or pending connection to be read (for confirmation). 

   >> TCP STATUS MUST allow TSAD entries for ongoing TCP connections 
   (i.e., not in the CLOSED state) to be modified. Parameters not used 
   to index a connection MAY be modified; parameters used to index a 
   connection MUST NOT be modified.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

   TSAD entries for TCP connections not in the CLOSED state are deleted 
   indirectly using the CLOSE or ABORT commands. This avoids key reuse, 
   which could contribute to packet replays.. 

   >> Use of CLOSE or ABORT MUST retain the TSAD entry in a table to 
   assist with checking for key reuse. 

   This entry may correspond to one of the wait states of TCP (FIN-WAIT-
   1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, or TIME-WAIT), or may 
   be stored separately (i.e., in the key reuse table, for connections 
   proceeding rapidly to CLOSED). The size of this key reuse table and 
   duration of retained entries is up to the user, where we again advise 
   the application of known key management principles [RFC3562]. 

   TCP SEND and RECEIVE are not affected by TCP-AO. 

4.2. TCP States and Transitions 

   TCP includes the states LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED, ESTABLISHED, 
   FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT, and 
   CLOSED. 

   >> A TSAD entry MAY be associated with any TCP state. 

   >> A TSAD entry MAY underspecify the TCP connection for the LISTEN 
   state. Such an entry MUST NOT be used for more than one connection 
   progressing out of the LISTEN state.  

4.3. TCP Segments 

   TCP includes control (at least one of SYN, FIN, RST flags set) and 
   data (none of SYN, FIN, or RST flags set) segments. Note that some 
   control segments can include data (e.g., SYN). 

   >> All TCP segments MUST be checked against the TSAD for matching TCP 
   connection IDs. 

   >> TCP segments matching TSAD entries with non-NULL MACs without TCP-
   AO, or with TCP-AO and whose MACs and/or KeyIDs (the latter when in 
   use) do not validate MUST be silently discarded. 

   >> TCP segments with TCP-AO but not matching TSAD entries MUST be 
   silently accepted; this is required for equivalent function with TCPs 
   not implementing TCP-AO.  

   >> Silent discard events SHOULD be signaled to the user as a warning, 
   and silent accept events MAY be signaled to the user as a warning.

   Both warnings, if available, MUST be accessible via the STATUS 
   interface. Either signal MAY be asynchronous, but if so they MUST be 
   rate-limited. Either signal MAY be logged; logging SHOULD allow rate-
   limiting as well. 

   All TCP-AO processing occurs between the interface of TCP and IP; for 
   incoming segments, this occurs after validation of the TCP checksum. 
   For outgoing segments, this occurs before computation of the TCP 
   checksum. 

   Note that the TCP-AO option is not negotiated. It is the 
   responsibility of the receiver to determine when TCP-AO is required 
   and to enforce that requirement.  

4.4. Sending TCP Segments 

   The following procedure describes the modifications to TCP to support 
   TCP-AO when a segment departs. 

   1. Check the segment's TCP connection ID against the TSAD 

   2. If there is NO TSAD entry, omit the TCP-AO option. Proceed with 
      computing the TCP checksum and transmit the segment.  

   3. If there is a TSAD entry with zero key tuples, omit the TCP-AO 
      option. Proceed with computing the TCP checksum and transmit the 
      segment. 

   4. If there is a TSAD entry and a key tuple and the outgoing MAC is 
      NONE, omit the TCP-AO option. Proceed with computing the TCP 
      checksum and transmit the segment. 

   5. If there is a TSAD entry and a key tuple and the outgoing MAC is 
      not NONE: 

       a. Augment the TCP header with the TCP-AO, inserting the 
          appropriate Length and KeyID (the latter only if in use for 
          this connection) based on the indexed TSAD entry. Update the 
          TCP header length accordingly.

       b. Compute the MAC using the indexed TSAD entry and data from the 
          segment as specified in Section 2.2, including the TCP 
          pseudoheader and TCP header. 
           
          Note that excluded options (if indicated in the TSAD) are 
          deleted (rather than zeroed) when used as input to the MAC 
          calculation. Deletion allows options inserted post-MAC (e.g., 
          by middleboxes) to be correctly removed by the exclusion list. 

       c. Insert the MAC in the TCP-AO field. 

       d. Proceed with computing the TCP checksum on the outgoing packet 
          and transmit the segment. 

4.5. Receiving TCP Segments  

   The following procedure describes the modifications to TCP to support 
   TCP-AO when a segment arrives. 

   1. Check the segment's TCP connection ID against the TSAD. 

   2. If there is NO TSAD entry, proceed with TCP processing.  

   3. If there is a TSAD entry with zero key tuples, proceed with TCP 
      processing. 

   4. If there is a TSAD entry with a key tuple and the incoming MAC is 
      NONE, proceed with TCP processing. 

   5. If there is a TSAD entry with a key tuple and the incoming MAC is 
      not NONE: 

       a. Check that the segment's TCP-AO Length matches the length 
          indicated by the indexed TSAD. 

           i. If Lengths differ, silently discard the segment. Log 
               and/or signal the event as indicated in Section 4.3. 

       b. If the Length is odd, use the KeyID value to index the 
          appropriate key for this connection; if the length is zero, 
          use the single key in the response. 

           i. If the TSAD has no entry corresponding to the segment's 
               KeyID, silently discard the segment.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

       c. Compute the segment's MAC using the indexed TSAD entry and 
          portions of the segment as indicated in Section 2.2. 
           
          Again, note that excluded options are ignored (rather than 
          zeroed) when used as input to the MAC calculation. 

           i. If the computed MAC differs from the TCP-AO MAC field 
               value, silently discard the segment. Log and/or signal 
               the event as indicated in Section 4.3. 

       d. Proceed with TCP processing of the segment. 

   It is suggested that TCP-AO implementations validate a segment's 
   Length field before computing a MAC, to reduce the overhead incurred 
   by spoofed segments with invalid TCP-AO fields. 

4.6. Impact on TCP Header Size 

   The TCP-AO option typically uses a total of 16-18 bytes of TCP header 
   space. TCP-AO is no larger than and typically 4 bytes smaller than 
   the TCP MD5 option (assuming a 96-bit MAC). Although TCP option space 
   is limited, we believe TCP-AO is consistent with the desire to 
   authenticate TCP at the connection level for similar uses as were 
   intended by TCP MD5. 

5. Key Establishment and Duration Issues 

   The TCP-AO option does not provide a mechanism for connection key 
   negotiation or parameter negotiation (MAC algorithm, length, or use 
   of the TCP-AO option) or rekeying during a connection. We assume out-
   of-band mechanisms for key establishment, parameter negotiation, and 
   rekeying. This separation of key use from key management is similar 
   to that in the IPsec security suite [RFC4301][RFC4306]. 

   We encourage users of TCP-AO to apply known techniques for generating 
   appropriate keys, including the use of reasonable connection key 
   lengths, limited connection key sharing, and limiting the duration of 
   connection key use [RFC3562]. 

   TCP-AO supports rekeying in which new keys are negotiated out-of-
   band, either via a protocol or a manual procedure [RFC4808]. New keys 
   use is coordinated using the out-of-band mechanism to update the TSAD 
   at both TCP endpoints. In the default case, where only a single key 
   is used at a time, the temporary use of invalid keys would result in 
   packets being dropped; TCP is already robust to such drops. Such 
   drops may affect TCP's throughput temporarily, as a result TCP-AO

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

   benefits from the use of congestion control support for temporary 
   path outages. 

   >> TCP-AO SHOULD be deployed in conjunction with support for 
   selective acknowledgement (SACK), including support for multiple lost 
   segments in the same round trip [RFC2018][RFC3517]. 

   Note that TCP-AO's support for rekeying is designed to be minimal in 
   the default case. Segments carry only enough context to identify the 
   security association [RFC4301][RFC4306]. In TCP-AO, this context is 
   provided by the socket pair (IP addresses and ports for source and 
   destination). In the default case, the key is identified only in the 
   TSAD, and coordinated by a separate mechanism not specified in TCP-
   AO. In cases where such coordination is difficult, or where loss 
   during rekeying is inappropriate, the TSAD can contain multiple 
   concurrent keys. Where multiple keys are used, the KeyID field is 
   used to identify the key that corresponds to a segment, to avoid the 
   need for expensive trial-and-error testing of keys in sequence. 

   The KeyID field may also be useful in coordinating keys for new 
   connections. A TSAD may be configured that matches the unbound source 
   port, which would return a set of possible keys. The KeyID would then 
   indicate which key, allowing more efficient connection establishment; 
   otherwise, the keys could be tried in sequence. See also Section 5.1. 

   Implementations are encouraged to keep keys in a suitably private 
   area. Users of TCP-AO are encouraged to use different keys for 
   inbound and outbound MACs on a given TCP connection. 

5.1. Implementing the TSAD as an External Database 

   The TSAD implementation is considered external to TCP-AO. When an 
   external database is used, it would be useful to consider the 
   interface between TCP-AO and the TSAD. The following is largely a 
   restatement of information in Section 3. 

   The TSAD API is accessed during a connection as follows: 

   o  TCP connection identifier (ID) (The socket pair, sent as 4 byte IP 
      source address, 4 byte IP destination address, 2 byte TCP source 
      port, 2 byte TCP destination port). 

   o  Direction indicator (sent as a single byte, 0x00 = inbound, 0x01 = 
      outbound)

   o  Number of bytes to be sent/received (two bytes); this is used on 
      the send side to trigger bytecount-based KeyID changes, and on the 
      receive side only for statistics or length-sensitive KeyID 
      selection. 

   o  KeyID (single byte, optional as indicated by a flag elsewhere in 
      the TSAD) 

   The call passes the number of bytes sent/received, and an indication 
   of the direction (send/receive), to enable traffic-based key 
   rollover. 

   The source port can be 'unbound', indicated by the value 0x0000. In 
   this case, the source port is considered a wildcard, and all 
   corresponding TSAD entries (typically also indexed by the KeyID in 
   that case) are returned as a list. This feature is used during 
   connection establishment. 

   TSAD calls return the following parameters: 

   o  TCP Option exclusion list (a list of TCP option Kind bytes, with 
      0x00 having the meaning "exclude all"). 

   o  An ordered list of zero or more connection key tuples: 
      <KeyID, MAC type, MAC length, connection key> 

       o  KeyID (one byte, ignored if the KeyID is not present) 

       o  MAC type (four bytes, an IKEv2 Transform Type 3 ID [RFC4306]) 

       o  Key length (one byte) 

       o  Connection key (byte sequence, indicating the key value) 

   When the TSAD returns zero keys, it is indicating that there are no 
   currently valid keys for the connection.  

6. Interactions with TCP MD5 

   TCP-AO is intended to be deployed without regard for existing TCP MD5 
   option support.  

   >> A TCP implementation MUST NOT use both TCP-AO and TCP MD5 for a 
   particular TCP connection, but MAY support TCP-AO and TCP MD5 
   simultaneously for different connections.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

   The Kind value explicitly indicates which of TCP-AO or TCP MD5 is 
   used for a particular connection in the TCP segments.  

   It is possible that the TSAD could be augmented to support TCP MD5, 
   although use of a TSAD-like system is not described in RFC2385.  

   It is possible to require TCP-AO for a connection or TCP MD5, but it 
   is not possible to require 'either'. Note that when TCP MD5 is 
   required on for a connection, it must be used [RFC2385]. This 
   prevents combined use of the two options for a given connection, to 
   be determined by the other end of the connection. 

7. Interactions with NAT/NAPT Devices 

   TCP-AO assumes that NAT/NAPT traversal is handled in similar ways to 
   IPsec [RFC2766][RFC3947]. I.e., traversing such a device requires the 
   use of a tunnel to avoid the NAT/NAPT from translating fields in the 
   TCP and IP headers TCP-AO uses in its MAC calculation. Such a tunnel 
   may need to coincide with the channel over which keys are exchanged, 
   as in IPsec NAT traversal [RFC3947]. 

8. Evaluation of Requirements Satisfaction 

   TCP-AO satisfies all the current requirements for a revision to TCP 
   MD5, as indicated in [Be07] and under current developemt. This should 
   not be a surprise, as the majority of the evolving requirements are 
   derived from its design. The following is a summary of those 
   requirements and notes where relevant. 

   1. Protected Elements - see Section 2.2.  

       a. TCP pseudoheader, including IPv4 and IPv6 versions. Note that 
          we do not allow optional coverage because we present a 
          solution that does not require such to interoperate with 
          NAT/NAPT devices. 

       b. TCP header. Note that we do not allow port coverage to be 
          optional because we present a solution that does not require 
          this to interoperate with NAT/NAPT devices. 

       c. TCP options. Allows exclusion of any option desired except 
          TCP-AO, as required. 

       d. TCP data. Done. 

   2. Option structure requirements

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

       a. Privacy. TCP-AO exposes only the key index, MAC, and overall 
          option length. Note that short MACs could be obscured by using 
          longer option lengths but specifying a short MAC length (this 
          is equivalent to a different MAC algorithm, and is specified 
          in the TSAD entry). See Section 2.2.  

       b. Allow optional per connection. Done - see Sections 4.3, 4.4, 
          and 4.5.  

       c. Require non-optional. Done - see Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5.  

       d. Standard parsing. Done - see Section 2.2.  

       e. Compatible with Large Windows. Done - see Section 2.2. The 
          size of the option is intended to allow use with Large Windows 
          and SACK. See also Section 1.1, which indicates that TCP-AO is 
          4 bytes shorter than TCP MD5 in the default case, assuming a 
          96-bit MAC. 

       f. Compatible with SACK. Done - see Section 2.2. The size of the 
          option is intended to allow use with Large Windows and SACK. 
          See also Section 5 regarding key management. See also Section 
          1.1, which indicates that TCP-AO is 4 bytes shorter than TCP 
          MD5 in the default case. 

   3. Cryptography requirements 

       a. Baseline defaults. TCP-AO uses TBD-WG-MACS as the default, as 
          noted in Section 2.2.   

       b. Good algorithms. TCP-AO uses TBD-WG-MACS as the default, but 
          does not otherwise specify the algorithms used. That would be 
          specified in the key management protocol, and should be 
          limited there. 

       c. Algorithm agility. TCP-AO allows any desired algorithm, 
          subject to TCP option space limitations, as noted in Section 
          2.2. The TSAD allows separate connections to use different 
          algorithms. 

       d. Pre-TCP processing. Done - see Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5. 
          Note that pre-TCP processing is required, because TCP segments 
          cannot be discarded solely based on a combination of 
          connection state and out-of-window checks; many such segments, 
          although discarded, cause a host to respond with a replay of 
          the last valid ACK, e.g. [RFC793].

       e. Parameter changes require key changes. TSAD parameters that 
          should not change during a connection (TCP connection ID, 
          receiver TCP connection ID, TCP option exclusion list) cannot 
          change. Other parameters change only when a key is changed, 
          using the key tuple mechanism in the TSAD. See Section 3.  

   4. Keying requirements. TCP-AO does not specify a key management 
      system, but does indicate a proposed interface to the TSAD, 
      allowing a completely separate key system. 

       a. Intraconnection rekeying. Supported by the KeyID and multiple 
          key tuples in a TSAD entry; see Section 3.  

       b. Efficient rekeying. Supported by the KeyID. See Section 5.  

       c. Automated and manual keying. Supported by the TSAD interface. 
          See Section 5.  

       d. Key management agnostic. Supported by the TSAD interface. See 
          Section 5.1.  

   5. Expected constraints 

       a. Silent failure. Done - see Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5.  

       b. At most one such option per segment. Done - see Section 2.2.  

       c. Outgoing all or none. Done - see Section 4.4.  

       d. Incoming all checked. Done - see Section 4.5.  

       e. Non-interaction with TCP MD5. Done - see Section 6.  

       f. Optional ICMP discard. Done - see Section 9.  

       g. Allows use of NAT/NAPT devices. Done - see Section 7.  

       h. Maintain TCP connection semantics, in which only the socket 
          pair defines a TCP association and all its security 
          parameters. Done - see Sections 3 and 7. 

       i. Try to avoid creating a CPU DOS attack opportunity. Done - see 
          Section 9.

9. Security Considerations 

   Use of TCP-AO, like use of TCP MD5 or IPsec, will impact host 
   performance. Connections that are known to use TCP-AO can be attacked 
   by transmitting segments with invalid MACs. Attackers would need to 
   know only the TCP connection ID and TCP-AO Length value to 
   substantially impact the host's processing capacity. This is similar 
   to the susceptibility of IPsec to on-path attacks, where the IP 
   addresses and SPI would be visible. For IPsec, the entire SPI space 
   (32 bits) is arbitrary, whereas for routing protocols typically only 
   the source port (16 bits) is arbitrary. As a result, it would be 
   easier for an off-path attacker to spoof a TCP-AO segment that could 
   cause receiver validation effort. However, we note that between 
   Internet routers both ports could be arbitrary (i.e., determined a-
   priori out of band), which would constitute roughly the same off-path 
   antispoofing protection of an arbitrary SPI. 

   TCP-AO, like TCP MD5, may inhibit connectionless resets. Such resets 
   typically occur after peer crashes, either in response to new 
   connection attempts or when data is sent on stale connections; in 
   either case, the recovering endpoint may lack the connection key 
   required (e.g., if lost during the crash). This may result in time-
   outs, rather than more responsive recovery after such a crash. 

   TCP-AO does not include a fast decline capability, e.g., where a SYN-
   ACK is received without an expected TCP-AO option and the connection 
   is quickly reset or aborted. Normal TCP operation will retry and 
   timeout, which is what should be expected when the intended receiver 
   is not capable of the TCP variant required anyway. Backoff is not 
   optimized because it would present an opportunity for attackers on 
   the wire to abort authenticated connection attempts by sending 
   spoofed SYN-ACKs without the TCP-AO option. 

   TCP-AO does not expose the MAC algorithm used to authenticate a 
   particular connection; that information is kept in the TSAD at the 
   endpoints, and is not indicated in the header. 

   TCP-AO is intended to provide similar protections to IPsec, but is 
   not intended to replace the use of IPsec or IKE either for more 
   robust security or more sophisticated security management. 

   TCP-AO does not address the issue of ICMP attacks on TCP. IPsec makes 
   recommendations regarding dropping ICMPs in certain contexts, or 
   requiring that they are endpoint authenticated in others [RFC4301]. 
   There are other mechanisms proposed to reduce the impact of ICMP 
   attacks by further validating ICMP contents and changing the effect 

 
 
Touch                    Expires May 11, 2008                 [Page 25] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     November 2007 
    

   of some messages based on TCP state, but these do not provide the 
   level of authentication for ICMP that TCP-AO provides for TCP [Go07]. 

   >> A TCP-AO implementation MUST allow the system administrator to 
   configure whether TCP will ignore incoming ICMP messages of Type 3 
   Codes 2-4 intended for connections that match TSAD entries with non-
   NONE inbound MACs. An implementation SHOULD allow ignored ICMPs to be 
   logged.  

   This control affects only ICMPs that currently require 'hard errors' 
   which would abort the TCP connection. This recommendation is intended 
   to be similar to how IPsec would handle those messages [RFC4301]. 

   TCP-AO includes the TCP connection ID in the MAC calculation. This 
   prevents connections using the same key (for whatever reason) from 
   potentially enabling a traffic-crossing attack, in which segments to 
   one socket pair are diverted to attack a different socket pair. When 
   multiple connections use the same key, it would be useful to know 
   that packets intended for one ID could not be (maliciously or 
   otherwise) modified in transit and end up being authenticated for the 
   other ID. The ID cannot be zeroed, because to do so would require 
   that the TSAD index was unique in both directions (ID->key and key-
   >ID). That requirement would place an additional burden of uniqueness 
   on keys within endsystems, and potentially across endsystems. 
   Although the resulting attack is low probability, the protection 
   afforded by including the received ID warrants its inclusion in the 
   MAC, and does not unduly increase the MAC calculation or key 
   management system. 

   The use of any security algorithm can present an opportunity for a 
   CPU DOS attack, where the attacker sends false, random segments that 
   the receiver under attack expends substantial CPU effort to reject. 
   In IPsec, such attacks are reduced by the use of a large Security 
   Parameter Index (SPI) and Sequence Number fields to partly validate 
   segments before CPU cycles are invested validated the Integrity Check 
   Value (ICV). In TCP-AO, the socket pair performs most of the function 
   of IPsec's SPI, and IPsec's Sequence Number, used to avoid replay 
   attacks, isn't needed due to TCP's Sequence Number, which is used to 
   reorder received segments. Unfortunately, it is not useful to 
   validate TCP's Sequence Number before performing a TCP-AO 
   authentication calculation, because many out-of-window segments still 
   cause TCP protocol actions (e.g., ACK retransmission) [RFC793]. It is 
   similarly not useful to add a separate Sequence Number field to the 
   TCP-AO option, because doing so could cause a change in TCP's 
   behavior even when segments are valid.

10. IANA Considerations 

   The TCP-AO option defines no new namespaces. 

   The TCP-AO option uses the TCP option Kind value TCP-IANA-KIND, 
   allocated by IANA from the TCP option Kind namespace. 

   To specify MAC algorithms, TCP-AO uses the 4-byte namespace of IKEv2 
   Transform Type 3 IDs [RFC4306]. 

   [NOTE: The following to be removed prior to publication as an RFC] 

   The TCP-AO option requires that IANA allocate a value from the TCP 
   option Kind namespace, to be replaced for TCP-IANA-KIND throughout 
   this document.
