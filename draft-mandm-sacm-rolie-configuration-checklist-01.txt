       Definition of the ROLIE configuration checklist Extension
           draft-mandm-sacm-rolie-configuration-checklist-01

Abstract

   This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
   Exchange (ROLIE) core by defining a new information-type to ROLIE's
   atom:category pertaining to security configuration checklists.
   Additional supporting requirements are also defined which describe
   the use of specific formats and link relations pertaining to the new
   information-type.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Resource-Oriented
   Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) [RFC8322] protocol [RFC8322]
   to support the publication of configuration checklist information.
   Many enterprises operate according to guidance provided to them by a
   control framework ( [CIS_Critical_Controls] , [PCI_DSS] ,
   [NIST_800-53] etc.), which often prescribe that an enterprise define
   a standard, secure configuration for each technology they operate.
   Such standard secure configurations are often referred to as
   configuration checklists.  These configuration checklists contain a
   set of configuration recommendations for a given endpoint.  A
   configuration recommendation prescribes expected values pertaining to
   one or more discrete endpoint attributes.

2.  Terminology

   Configuration Checklist A configuration checklist is an organized
   collection of rules about a particular kind of system or platform.

   Configuration Item  Generally synonymous with endpoint attribute.

Internet-Draft                rolie-cc-ext                     July 2018


   Configuration Recommendation A configuration recommendation is an
   expression of the desired posture of one or more configuration items.
   A configuration recommendation generally includes the description of
   the recommendation, a rationale statement, and the expected state of
   collected posture information.

   TODO: Others??  TBD

   TODO: There needs to be a "normative" reference to the SCAP 1.2/3
   specifications and schema definitions

3.  The 'configuration-checklist' information type

   This document defines and registers a new information-type:
   "configuration-checklist".

   The "configuration-checklist" information type represents a body of
   information describing a set of configuration recommendations.  A
   configuration recommendation is, minimally, a configurable item
   paired with a recommended value or range of value.  Depending on the
   source, a configuration recommendation may carry with it additional
   information (i.e. description, references, rationale, etc.).
   Provided below is a non-exhaustive list of information that may be
   considered as components of a configuration checklist.

   o  A "Data Stream":

   o  A "Benchmark"

   o  A "Profile"

   o  A "Value"

   o  A "Rule" or "Group" of Rules

      *  Description

      *  Rationale

      *  Remediation Instructions

      *  Information, described in the dialect of a supported "check
         system", indicating the method(s) used to audit the checklist
         configuration item.

   o  Applicable Platform Information

   o  Information regarding a set of patches to be evaluated

Internet-Draft                rolie-cc-ext                     July 2018


   o  Any supported "tailoring" information, providing a method for
      evaluating entities to refine the recommendations in the data
      stream without modifying the published data stream content.  (WKM
      NOTE: Does "tailoring" need to be here?  Why would any tailoring
      be included in a published feed?  Unless the organization is re-
      publishing the content with their tailoring included.)

4.  Data format requirements

   This section defines usage guidance and additional requirements
   related to data formats above and beyond those specified in [RFC8322]
   . The following formats are expected to be commonly used to express
   software descriptor information.  For this reason, this document
   specifies additional requirements to ensure interoperability.

   TODO, integrate this information:

   o  scap-1.2

   o  PDF

   o  xccdf-1.2-collection

   o  oval

   o  cvrf

   o  cve (should we reuse the enumref?); Look at the "enumref" and see
      if we can copy/paste configuration checklist-specific information
      in a similar manner?  Can we then include that enum reference in
      the ROLIE extension document or should we create a new "enumref"
      document separately?

   o  vulnerability

4.1.2.  Requirements

5.  rolie:property Extensions

   This document provides new registrations for valid rolie:property
   names.  These properties provide optional exposure point for valuable
   information in the linked content document.  Exposing this
   information in a rolie:property element means that clients do not
   need to download the linked document to determine if it contains
   information they are interested in.

   A breadth of metadata may be included with a configuration checklist
   as identifying information.  A publishing organization may wish to
   recognize or attribute checklist authors or contributors, or maintain
   a revision/version history over time.  Other metadata that may be
   included could indicate the various categories of products to which
   the checklist applies, such as Operating System, Network Device, or
   Application Server.

   The following list describes various 'rolie:property' constructs.

   o  contributor (0..n)

      *  An unbounded number of "rolie:property" elements with a "name"
         attribute of "contributor" may be included to indicate those
         individuals noted as recognized contributors to the
         configuration checklist and/or the recommendations contained
         within.

   o  checklist version: The "value" of the "checklist version" property
      indicates the version number of the configuration checklist, such
      as "3.1.1"

   o  title: The "value" of the "title" property indicates the document
      title of the configuration checklist, such as "CIS Benchmark for
      Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2"

   o  overview

6.  Use of the atom:link element

   The following link relations are defined in the following table.
   These relations are not registered in the Link Relation IANA table
   due to their niche usage.  These link relations are valid for any
   link element in a checklist Entry.

7.  Use of atom:category

   This document registers an additional atom:category name:
   'urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:checklist:nistncpproductcategory'

   When the name attribute of a category element is this names, the
   value attribute SHOULD be one of the valid product categories from
   the NIST NCP Product Category List, such as:

   o  Antivirus Software

   o  Application Server

   o  Auditing

   o  Authentication

   o  Automation/Productivity Application Suite
