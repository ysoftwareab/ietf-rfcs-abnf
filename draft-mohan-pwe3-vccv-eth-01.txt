This document proposes extensions to Virtual Circuit Connection
Verification (VCCV) procedures to add Ethernet OAM functionality.
VCCV supports connection verification applications for PWs regardless
of the underlying public service network technology. This document
proposes VCCV to support Ethernet OAM as an option to perform
operations and maintenance functions; especially when the PSN is
Ethernet.

1. Introduction

[VCCV] describes a mechanism for PSN-agnostic fault detection and
diagnostics for an emulated PW service. The VCCV control channel is
associated with a PW. VCCV control channel carries encapsulated
messages e.g. ICMP ping, BFD, MPLS ping etc.

Ethernet OAM, as being defined in [802.1ag] and [Y.1731], offers a
rich set of functionality that has been designed for proactive and
on-demand OAM. Some of the desirable functionalities e.g. performance
monitoring, remote maintenance, etc. are not available in MPLS ping,
BFD, etc. In addition, hierarchical OAM requirements have also been
identified in [MSPW-REQ], for which the solutions are not yet
identified. Such functionality may be added to mechanisms currently
used in [VCCV]; however, such functionality is not yet addressed and
Ethernet OAM has already defined these. Similar to MPLS ping, BFD,

Internet Draft  draft-mohan-pwe3-vccv-eth-01.txt       January 2007


etc. being used in MPLS/IP PSN, Ethernet OAM is a natural choice for
Ethernet based PSN.

As per the procedures described in [VCCV], the choice of Ethernet OAM
based VCCV messages can be negotiated between the PEs. This document
specifies the extensions required to support Ethernet OAM as an
option for VCCV messages.


2. Ethernet PSN

Ethernet is fast emerging as a viable PSN technology especially for
metro area networks. Recent discussions in IETF have also shown
considerable interest in Ethernet technology with specific work items
being created to address the control plane aspects of Ethernet PSN.
Examples include the TRILL WG, GELS BOF, and discussions around
generic PWs which seem to have indicated that PSNs may not be limited
to MPLS/IP.

Even though the PW over Ethernet PSN is not completely specified yet,
some solutions like [PWoPBT] have been proposed that address this
particular space. Since [VCCV] is meant to be agnostic to specific
PSN and provides capability to carry different message types which
are most often tied to the PSN type, this document adds an option to
VCCV control channel to carry Ethernet OAM messages.


3. VCCV Types Extension

[VCCV] specifies different types of protocols that can be carried in
the VCCV control channel simultaneously or individually. The
following sections indicate the specific extensions to [VCCV] to
support Ethernet OAM as an option for Ethernet PSN.


3.1 Ethernet OAM

This section can be added as a new section 5.3 in [VCCV].

In order to use Ethernet OAM, both ends of the PW must have signaled
the existence of a control channel and the ability to run Ethernet
OAM. The use of control channel provides the context required to bind
the Ethernet OAM messages to a particular PW.

Ethernet OAM includes the following OpCodes for Ethernet OAM messages
that can be carried in the VCCV control channel:

  01 -- CCM - Continuity check messages
  03 -- LBM - Loopback request message
  02 -- LBR - Loopback reply message
  05 -- LTM - Linktrace request message
  04 -- LTR - Linktrace reply message


Mohan, et. al          Expiry : July 2007                  [Page 3]
Internet Draft  draft-mohan-pwe3-vccv-eth-01.txt       January 2007


  33 -- AIS - Alarm indication signal message
  41 -- MCC - Maintenance communication channel message
  43 -- LMM - Single-ended loss measurement request message
  42 -- LMR - Single-ended oss measurement reply message
  45 -- 1DM - Dual-ended delay measurement message
  47 -- DMM - Two-way delay measurement request message
  46 -- DMR - Two-way delay measurement reply message
  xx -- others that may not be needed here


3.2 Ethernet OAM Capability Indications

This section can be added to section 6.1 in [VCCV].

The format of the VCCV parameter field is as follows:

0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 0
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|      0x0c     |       0x04    |   CC Types    |   CV Types    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The CV Type Indicators field is a bit mask used to indicate the
specific type or types (i.e.: none, one or more) of control channel
packets that may be sent on the specified control channel. The
defined values are:

  0x01    ICMP Ping
  0x02    LSP Ping
  0x04    BFD for PW Fault Detection only
  0x08    BFD for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault
           Status Signaling
  0x10    Ethernet OAM as defined in [Y.1731] and [802.1ag]


4. IANA Considerations

4.1 CV Types

This section can be added to section 8.1.2 in [VCCV].

  0x01    ICMP Ping
  0x02    LSP Ping
  0x04    BFD
  0x10    Ethernet OAM


5. Ethernet OAM Applications and Scenarios

5.1 Ethernet OAM Encapsulation

TBD

5.2 Ethernet OAM Functions

TBD


5.3 Ethernet OAM in MSPW

6. Security Considerations

Introduction of the Ethernet OAM messages to VCCV control channel
does not present any new security considerations besides those that
are already listed in [VCCV].
