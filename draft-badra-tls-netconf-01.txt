Abstract 
    
   The NETCONF configuration protocol provides mechanisms to install, 
   manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices. This 
   document describes how to use TLS to secure NETCONF exchanges. 
    
1 Introduction 
    
   The NETCONF protocol [NETCONF] defines a simple mechanism through 
   which a network device can be managed.  NETCONF is connection-
   oriented, requiring a persistent connection between peers.  This

   connection must provide reliable, sequenced data delivery, integrity 
   and confidentiality and peers authentication. This document 
   describes how to use TLS [TLS] to secure NETCONF connections. 
    
1.2 Requirements language and Terminologies 
    
   The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", and "MAY", in this document 
   are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
    
1.3 Terminology 
    
   This document uses the following terms: 
    
   manager 
   It refers to the end initiating the NETCONF connection. It issues 
   the NETCONF RPC commands. 
    
   agent 
   It refers to the end replying to the manager's commands during the 
   NETCONF connection. 
    
2. NETCONF over TLS 
    
   Since TLS is application protocol-independent, NETCONF can operate 
   on top of the TLS protocol transparently. Therefore, use NETCONF 
   over TLS precisely as we would use NETCONF over the transport layer. 
    
2.1. Connection Initiation 
    
   The agent acting as the NETCONF client SHOULD also act as the TLS 
   client. It SHOULD initiate a connection to the server on the 
   appropriate port and then send the TLS ClientHello to begin the TLS 
   handshake. Once the TLS handshake has been finished, the client or 
   the server MAY then send their NETCONF messages. All these messages 
   are encapsulated into TLS records of type "application data". These 
   records are protected using the TLS material keys. 
    
2.2. Connection Closure 
    
   The NETCONF agent MAY stop the NETCONF connection at any time and 
   therefore notify the receiver that no more data on this channel will 
   be sent and that any data received after a closure request will be 
   ignored. TLS has the ability for secure connection closure using the 
   Alert protocol. When the agent processes a closure request of the 
   NETCONF, the agent SHALL respond, terminate the TLS session, and 
   close the transport connection. The agent MUST NOT process any RPC 
   commands received on the current session after receiving the closure 
   request and the manager MUNT NOT send any RPC command after sending

   the closure request. The agent MUST respond with a confirmation of 
   the closure and close down the channel immediately. 
    
3. Security Considerations 
    
   The security considerations described throughout [TLS] apply here as 
   well. 
    
4. IANA Considerations 
    
   This section provides guidance to the IANA to assign a TCP port 
   number which will be the default port for NETCONF over TLS.
