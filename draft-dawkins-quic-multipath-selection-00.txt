               Path Selection for Multiple Paths In QUIC
             draft-dawkins-quic-multipath-selection-00

Abstract

   In QUIC working group discussions about proposals to use multiple
   paths, an obvious question came up - given multiple paths, how does
   QUIC select paths to send packets over?

   The answer to that question may inform decisions in the QUIC working
   group about the scope of any multipath extensions considered for
   experimentation and adoption.

   This document is intended to summarize aspects of path selection from
   those contributions and conversations.

   It is recognized that path selection is not the only important open
   question about QUIC Multipath, but other open questions are out of
   scope for this document.

Internet-Draft        QUIC Multipath Path Selection            June 2021


   The answer to that question may inform decisions in the QUIC working
   group about the scope of any multipath extensions considered for
   experimentation and adoption.

   This document is intended to summarize aspects of path selection from
   those contributions and conversations.

   It is recognized that path selection is not the only important open
   question about QUIC Multipath, but other open questions are out of
   scope for this document.

1.1.  Why We Should Look at Path Selection Strategies Now

   One of the first questions that's come up in discussions about
   multiple paths for QUIC has been about path selection.  As soon as an
   implementation has multiple paths available, it must decide how to
   use these paths.  The [RFC9000] answer, relying on connection
   migration, is "if you have multiple paths available, you can validate
   more than one connection at a time, but you only send on one
   connection at a time, and you migrate to another connection when you
   decide sending on the current connection is no longer appropriate.
   How you decide to migrate to another connection is up to you".

   That has been a fine answer for many of the implementers who have
   worked on the first version of QUIC, and have deployed it in their
   networks.  For other implementers, targeting other use cases and
   other networking environments, it may not be sufficient.

   To take only one example, one of several presentations at
   [QUIC-interim-20-10] described aspects of 3GPP Access Traffic
   Steering, Switch and Splitting support (ATSSS), which contained four
   "Steering Modes" as part of Rel-16 in 2019 [TS23501], each of which
   corresponding roughly to a path selection strategy described in
   Section 3 of this document.  A study on "ATSSS Phase 2" [TR23700-93]
   included four more Steering Modes for Rel-17, expected to be
   finalized in mid-2021, and none of these eight (so far) Steering
   Modes are based on QUIC - they are based on Multipath TCP ([RFC8684]
   or simple IP packet forwarding.  And if that were not enough, a
   proposal for a study on "ATSSS Phase 3" [S2-2104599] was provided to
   the SA2 145-e meeting in May 2021.  Some of the ATSSS strategies rely
   in 5G network internals and don't translate to the broader Internet,
   but most do translate, and 3GPP participants certainly aren't the
   only people thinking about path selection strategies.

Internet-Draft        QUIC Multipath Path Selection            June 2021


   Since the various proposals presented at [QUIC-interim-20-10] were
   developed in isolation from each other, the path selection strategies
   that they reflect may be similar between proposals, but not quite the
   same, and none of the proposals presented had more than two
   strategies in common with any other proposal.

   Given the number of path selection strategies being considered,
   implemented, and even deployed in any number of venues, and the
   potential for combinatorial explosion as described in Section 3.10,
   it seems that identifying common aspects of path selection
   strategies, sooner rather than later, is important.

1.2.  Notes for Readers

   This document is an informational Internet-Draft, not adopted by any
   IETF working group, and does not carry any special status within the
   IETF.

   Please note well that this document reflects the author's current
   understanding of past working group discussions and proposals.
   Contributions that add or improve considerations are welcomed, as
   described in Section 1.4.

1.3.  Minimal Terminology

   In this document, "QUIC multipath" is only used as shorthand for
   "QUIC using multiple paths".  It does not refer to a specific
   proposal.

   In this document, "path selection strategy" means the policy that a
   QUIC sender uses to guide its choice between multiple interfaces of a
   QUIC connection for "the next packet".

   This document adopts three terms, stolen from [TS23501], that seemed
   helpful in previous discussions about multipath in the QUIC working
   group.

   *  Traffic Steering - selecting an initial path (in [RFC9000], this
      would be "validating a connection, and then using it".  Although
      an [RFC9000] client can validate multiple connections, the client
      will only use one validated connection at a time.

   *  Traffic Switching - selecting a different validated path (in
      [RFC9000], this is something like "migrating to a new validated
      connection", although whether connection migration as defined in
      [RFC9000]) would be sufficient is discussed in Section 4).

Internet-Draft        QUIC Multipath Path Selection            June 2021


   *  Traffic Splitting - using multiple validated paths simultaneously
      (this would almost certainly require an extension beyond
      connection migration as defined in [RFC9000]).

   "Traffic Steering" does not require any extension to [RFC9000], and
   is not discussed further in this document.  The focus will be on
   "Traffic Switching" and "Traffic Splitting".

2.  Background for this document

   A number of individual draft proposals for "QUIC over multiple paths"
   have been submitted to the IETF QUIC and INTAREA working groups,
   dating back as far as 2017.  The author thinks that the complete list
   is as follows (and reminders for proposals he missed are welcomed):

   *  [I-D.an-multipath-quic]

   *  [I-D.an-multipath-quic-application-policy]

   *  [I-D.an-multipath-quic-traffic-distribution]

   *  [I-D.chan-quic-owl]

   *  [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath],

   *  [I-D.huitema-quic-mpath-req]

   *  [I-D.huitema-quic-mpath-option])

   *  [I-D.liu-multipath-quic]

Internet-Draft        QUIC Multipath Path Selection            June 2021


   *  [I-D.piraux-intarea-quic-tunnel-session]

   [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers] has also been submitted to the
   Internet Congestion Control Research Group [ICCRG-charter] in the
   Internet Research Task Force.  It contains specific proposals for
   implementing some multipath schedulers, and includes some discussion
   of path selection relevant to this document.

   One point of confusion in QUIC working group discussions was that the
   various proposals (also using Multipath TCP [RFC8684], so not all
   proposals were QUIC-specific) discussed in working group meetings and
   on the QUIC mailing list were from various proponents who weren't
   solving the same problem.  This meant that no two of the use cases
   presented at the QUIC working group virtual interim on QUIC Multipath
   [QUIC-interim-20-10] were relying on the same strategies.

   It seemed useful to collect the path selection strategies described
   in those proposals, to look for common elements, and to write them
   down in one place, to allow more focused discussion.
   [I-D.dawkins-quic-what-to-do-with-multipath] was intended to
   summarize, at a high level, various proposals for the use of
   multipath capabilities in QUIC, both inside the IETF and outside the
   IETF, in order to identify elements that were common across
   proposals.  This draft tries to describe the impact of these various
   strategies on potential QUIC Multipath extensions.

   One element that is certainly worth considering is whether the path
   selection strategies that have been proposed can be satisfied using a
   small number of "building block" strategies.

3.  Overview of Proposed Path Selection Strategies

   The following strategies were discussed at [QUIC-interim-20-10], and
   afterwards on the QUIC mailing list.  These are summarized in this
   section, are described in more detail in
   [I-D.dawkins-quic-what-to-do-with-multipath], and are attributed to
   various proposals in that document.

   *  Active-Standby - described in Section 3.1

   *  Latency Versus Bandwidth - described in Section 3.2

   *  Bandwidth Aggregation/Load Balancing - described in Section 3.3

   *  Minimum RTT Difference - described in Section 3.4

   *  Round-Trip-Time Thresholds - described in Section 3.5

Internet-Draft        QUIC Multipath Path Selection            June 2021


   *  RTT Equivalence - described in Section 3.6

   *  Priority-based - described in Section 3.7

   *  Redundant - described in Section 3.8

   *  Control Plane Versus Data Plane - described in Section 3.9

   *  Combinations of Strategies - described in Section 3.10

3.1.  Active-Standby

   The traffic associated with a specific flow will be sent via a
   specific path (the 'active path') and switched to another path
   (called 'standby path') when the active access is unavailable.

3.2.  Latency Versus Bandwidth

   Some traffic might be sent over a network path with lower latency and
   other traffic might be sent over a different network path with higher
   bandwidth.

3.3.  Bandwidth Aggregation/Load Balancing

   Traffic is sent using all available paths simultaneously, so that all
   available bandwidth is utilized, likely based on something like
   weighted round-robin path selection.  This strategy is often used for
   bulk transfers.

3.4.  Minimum RTT Difference

   Traffic is sent over the path with the lowest smoothed RTT among all
   available paths, in order to minimize latency for latency-sensitive
   flows.

3.5.  Round-Trip-Time Thresholds

   Traffic is sent over the first path with a smoothed RTT that meets a
   certain threshold.

3.6.  RTT Equivalence

   When multiple paths each have sufficiently similar smoothed RTTs,
   traffic is sent over all of these paths.  This is similar to
   "Bandwidth Aggregation/Load Balancing", with the additional
   qualification that not all available paths are used for this traffic.

Internet-Draft        QUIC Multipath Path Selection            June 2021


3.7.  Priority-based

   Priorities are assigned to each path (often by association with
   network interfaces).  Traffic is sent on a highest-priority path
   until it becomes congested, and then "overflows" onto a lower-
   priority path.

3.8.  Redundant

   Traffic is replicated over two or more paths.  This strategy could be
   used continuously, but is more commonly used when measured network
   conditions indicate that redundant sending may be necessary to
   increase the likelihood that at least one copy of each packet will
   arrive at the receiver.

3.9.  Control Plane Versus Data Plane

   An application might stream media over one or more available paths
   (based on one of the other strategies named in this section), but
   might send ACK traffic or retransmission over a path specifically
   chosen for that purpose.  This is more likely to be beneficial if the
   path characteristics differ significantly between available paths -
   for example, satellite uplink/downlink stations connected by both
   higher-bandwidth Low Earth Orbit satellite paths and lower-bandwidth
   cellular or landline paths.

3.10.  Combinations of Strategies

   In addition to the strategies described above, it is also possible to
   combine these strategies.  For example, a scheduler might use load-
   balancing over three paths, but when one of the paths becomes
   unavailable, the scheduler might switch to the two paths that are
   still available, in a way similar to Active-Standby.  This is very
   much an example chosen at random - potentially, there are many
   combinations that could be useful.

4.  Implications for QUIC Multipath

   This section summarizes potential implications for "Multipath QUIC"
   of path selection strategies described in Section 3, dividing them
   between "Traffic Switching" (Section 4.1) and "Traffic Splitting"
   (Section 4.2).

Internet-Draft        QUIC Multipath Path Selection            June 2021


4.1.  Selecting a Single Path Among Multiple Validated Paths ("Traffic
      Switching")

   If a sender using Active-Standby (described in Section 3.1) does not
   perform frequent path switching, it can likely be supported using
   connection migration as defined in [RFC9000] without change.

   *  The caveat here is that connection migration can include the also-
      implicit assumption that an endpoint can free up resources
      associated with the previously-active path.  If connection
      migration happens often enough, the endpoint may spend
      considerable time "thrashing" between allocating resources and
      quickly freeing them.  Of course, if a sender is frequently
      selecting a new path for connection migration, this probably
      degenerates into one of the other path selection strategies.

   Some path selection strategies could be supported by a mechanism as
   simple as the one proposed in [I-D.huitema-quic-mpath-option], which
   replaces "the implicit signaling of path migration through data
   transmission, by means of a new PATH_OPTION frame" (this isn't
   intended to imply the proposal is simple, only the explicit
   signaling), if the receiver uses this option to notify the sender of
   the preferred path.  For example, Minimum RTT Difference (described
   in Section 3.4) and Round-Trip-Time Thresholds (described in
   Section 3.5) likely fall into this category.

   Some path selection strategies are exploiting a relatively long-lived
   difference between paths - for example, Latency Versus Bandwidth
   (described in Section 3.2), Priority-based (described in
   Section 3.7), and Control Plane Versus Data Plane (described in
   Section 3.9) may fall into this category.  One might wonder why these
   senders would need to use a single "multipath connection", rather
   than multiple [RFC9000] connections, for these cases, but if there is
   a reason to use a single multipath connection, a mechanism similar to
   the one proposed in [I-D.huitema-quic-mpath-option] could also be
   used in these cases.

4.2.  Selecting Multiple Active Paths ("Traffic Splitting")

   Some path selection strategies are treating more than one path as a
   set of active paths, whether the sender is performing "Traffic
   Splitting" (as defined in Section 1.3)), as is the case for Bandwidth
   Aggregation/Load Balancing (described in Section 3.3) and RTT
   Equivalence (described in Section 3.6), or simply transmitting the
   same packet across multiple paths, as is the case for Redundant
   (described in Section 3.8).

   For these cases, a more complex mechanism is likely required.

4.3.  Arbitrary Combinations

   Because it is simple enough to imagine various combinations of
   strategies (as described in Section 3.10), it seems important to
   understand what basic building blocks are required in order to
   support the strategies that seem common across a variety of use
   cases, because interactions between strategies may have significant
   implications for QUIC Multipath that might not arise when considering
   strategies in isolation.

   This seems especially important because existing proposals for QUIC
   Multipath don't use the same vocabulary to describe path selection
   strategies, so implementations may not behave in the same way, even
   if they are each using a strategy that seems to be common.

5.  Next Steps

   If this discussion is useful, it may also be useful to take the next
   step, and identify potential building blocks that can be used to
   construct the path selection strategies described in Section 4.1 and
   Section 4.2.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   QUIC-specific security considerations are discussed in Section 21 of
   [RFC9000].

   Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-quic-datagram] discusses security
   considerations specific to the use of the Unreliable Datagram
   Extension to QUIC.

   Some "Multipath QUIC"-specific security considerations can be found
   in the corresponding section of [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].

   Having said that, it may be best to repeat the security
   considerations section from [I-D.huitema-quic-mpath-option]: "TBD.
   There are probably ways to abuse this.".
