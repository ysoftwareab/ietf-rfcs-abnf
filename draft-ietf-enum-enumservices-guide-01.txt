1.  Open Issues

   [RFC Editor: This section should be empty before publication]
      move security considerations from xml2rfc template to draft
      itself, and refer from template to the various security sections
      of RFC3761, this doc, etc.
      talk about how to choose type/subtype/etc?


2.  Changes

   [RFC Editor: This section is to be removed before publication]

   draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-01:
      alex: added Security Considerations section for the doc itself
      alex: added IANA Considerations section for the doc itself
      alex: added cookbook idea


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


4.  Introduction

   [ Note: This is work in progress - the ENUM crowd is invited to
   contribute, since issues clarified in this document will save the
   group time spent on each individual Enumservice registration.  Please
   mail your opinions/ideas to the WG list!! ]

   This document provides a guide to and template for the creation of
   new IANA registrations of Enumservices.  This document aims to
   enhance section 3 of RFC 3761 [2], where the registration procedure
   for Enumservices was initially documented at a high level.  However,
   the IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered an unnecessary amount
   of variation in the format of Enumservice drafts presented to the
   group.  The ENUM Working Group's view of what particular fields and
   information are required and/or recommended has also evolved, and
   capturing these best current practices is helpful in both the
   creation of new registrations, as well as the revision or refinement
   of existing registrations.

   For the purpose of this document, 'registration document' and
   'registration' refers to an Internet Draft proposing the IANA
   registration of an Enumservice following the procedures outlined

   above.

   [-00 Note: This is an early draft version.]


5.  Enumservice Creation Cookbook

   [FIXME: this is a proposal - comments appreciated]

5.1.  Preparation

   Before commencing work on a new Enumservice registration, following
   questions should be considered:

      Is there an existing Enumservice which could fulfill the desired
      functionality without overloading it?  Check the IANA Enumservice
      registrations FIXME ref
      Is there work in progress on a similar Enumservice?  Check the
      enum@ietf.org mailing list archives, and the Internet Drafts
      Archive FIXME ref

5.2.  About Type Names

   FIXME

5.3.  About Subtypes

   An Enumservice may optionally use a "subtype" do further specify the
   service to which a ENUM record refers to.  The following
   recommendations apply to such Enumservices:
      Subtypes SHOULD NOT be used to curtail the negotiation
      capabilities of the protocol used to contact the refered URI,
      unless this limitation is specifically desired.  If that is the
      case, authors MUST describe the motivation for this, and describe
      potential problems arising from this.
      If subtypes are defined, the minimum number SHOULD be two.  The
      choice of just one possible subtype for a given type does not add
      any information when selecting a ENUM record, and hence can be
      left out completely.  However, potential future expansion of a
      type towards several subtypes MAY justify the use of subtypes,
      even in the case just one is currently defined.
      [FIXME: talk about mixing subtyped / non subtyped for a type?]


6.  Required Sections and Information

   In addition to the typical sections required for an RFC as outlined
   in RFC 2223bis [3] (Instructions to RFC Authors), there are several



Livingood, et al.        Expires August 28, 2006                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Feb 2006


   sections which MUST appear in an IANA Registration for an
   Enumservice.  These sections are, as follows, and SHOULD be in the
   following order:

6.1.  Introduction (MANDATORY)

   An introductory section MUST be included.  This section will explain,
   in plain English, the purpose of and intended usage of the proposed
   Enumservice registration.

   The Introduction SHOULD start with a short sentence about ENUM,
   introduce the protocol used in the Enumservice, and discuss the
   Enumservice as it refers from the E.164 number to the protocol or
   service.

   The XML2RFC template in Appendix A contains a prototype of such an
   Introduction.

6.2.  Enumservice Registration for "foo" with Subtype "bar" (MANDATORY)

   This section MUST be included in an Enumservice registration.  In
   addition, where a given registration type has multiple subtypes,
   there MUST be a separate registration section for each subtype.  The
   following lists the sections and order of an Enumservice Registration
   section.  All types and subtypes SHOULD be listed in lower-case.

   Enumservice Name: "foo"

   Enumservice Type: "foo"

   Enumservice Subtype: "bar"

   URI Schemes: "bar:"

   Functional Specification:

      This Enumservice indicates that the remote resource identified can
      be addressed by the associated URI scheme in order to foo the bar.

   Security Considerations: See Section Section 6.5
      (a reference internal to a given registration document).

   Intended Usage: COMMON

      [-00 Note: Authors to explain the choices here in a later
      revision.]

   Authors:

      Madeline Smith and Katie Jones (for author contact detail see
      Authors' Addresses section).

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

      None

6.3.  Examples (MANDATORY)

   This section MUST show one or more example(s) of the Enumservice
   registration, for illustrative purposes.  The example(s) shall in no
   way limit the various forms that a given Enumservice may take and
   this should be noted at the beginning of this section of the
   document.  The example(s) MUST show the specific formatting of the
   intended NAPTRs [4], including one or more NAPTR example(s), AND a
   brief textual description, consisting of one or more sentences
   written in plain English, explaining the various parts or attributes
   of the record.

   The example SHOULD contain a brief description how a client
   supporting this Enumservice could behave, if that description was not
   already given in eg. the Introduction.

6.4.  Implementation Recommendations / Notes (OPTIONAL)

   If at all possible, recommendations that pertain to implemention
   and/or operations SHOULD be included.  Such a section is helpful to
   someone reading a registration and trying to understand how best to
   use it to support their network or service.

6.5.  Security Considerations (MANDATORY)

   A section explaining any potential security threats that are unique
   to the given registration MUST be included.  This MUST also include
   any information about access to Personally Identifiable Information
   (PII).  However, this section should not intended as a general
   security Best Current Practices (BCP) document or include general and
   obvious security recommendations, such as securing servers with
   strong password authentication.

6.6.  IANA Considerations (MANDATORY)

   [-00 Note: Will be exapanded in an upcoming revision.]

6.7.  Other Sections (OPTIONAL)

   Other sections, beyond those required by the IETF and/or IANA, which
   are cited or otherwise referenced here, MAY be included in an

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Feb 2006


   Enumservice registration.  These sections may relate to the specifics
   of the intended usage of the Enumservice registration and associated
   technical, operational, or administrative concerns.


7.  Blank Enumservice Template

   Appendix A contains a template which can be used to create Internet
   Drafts and RFC by means described on http://xml.resource.org/.


8.  Revision of Pre-Existing Enumservice RFCs

   Several Enumservice registrations, published via IETF RFCs, already
   exist at the time of the development of this document.  The authors
   recommend that these existing registration documents SHOULD be
   reviewed and, where necessary and appropriate, MAY be revised in
   accordance with the recommendations contained herein.  All future
   Enumservice registrations SHOULD follow the recommendations contained
   herein, where practical and applicable.


9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Considerations regarding this Document

   Since this document does not introduce any technology or protocol,
   there are no security issues to be considered for this memo itself.
   However, this document provides general security considerations for
   Enumservice registrations, which are to be referred from document
   defining or updating Enumservice registrations.

9.2.  Enumservice Security Considerations Guideline

   Section 6 of RFC 3761 already outlines security considerations
   affecting ENUM as a whole.  Enumservice registration documents do not
   need and SHOULD NOT repeat considerations already listed there, but
   they SHOULD include a reference to that section.

   ENUM refers to resources using preexisting URI schemes and protocols.
   Enumservice registration documents do not need and SHOULD NOT repeat
   security considerations affecting those protocols and URI schemes
   itself.

   However, in case that the inclusion of those protocols and URI
   schemes into ENUM specifically introduces new security issues, those
   issues MUST be lined out in the 'Security Considerations' section of
   the registration document.

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Feb 2006


   Section FIXME of this document contains generic security
   considerations affecting all Enumservice registrations.  Registration
   proposals SHOULD refer to that section from their 'Security
   Considerations' section.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document itself does not define a new protocol, and therefore
   has no considerations for IANA.  However, it contains a proposal for
   the 'IANA Considerations' section of actual Enumservice registration
   documents in Appendix A.

   Note: Section 6.2 is just an example of an Enumservice registration.
   The Enumservice "foo" outlined there MUST NOT be registered by IANA
   unless this memo is to be published on April 1st.
