Abstract

   Most of current address autoconfiguration mechanisms for MANET
   introduce significant load like message flooding, or are dependent on
   the underlying routing protocols. This document proposes a new
   mechanism that is intended to minimize these drawbacks.  It is also
   designed to be applicable for hybrid MANET, where a MANET is
   connected to Internet through one or more Interet gateways.

1. Introduction

   A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is self-organized by wireless mobile
   nodes, without any pre-installed infrastructures.  Data packets are
   delivered by multi-hop communication of nodes.  A topology of MANET
   is changed frequently due to the nodes' mobility.  Therefore, it is
   necessary to configure their addresses automatically.

   "Hybrid MANET" is a mobile ad hoc network that has connectivity to
   external networks.  The connectivity is provided by special node
   called `Internet gateway'.  If MANET nodes want to communicate with
   nodes on the external networks, the configured addresses must be
   globally unique.

   Recently, several solutions have been proposed to autoconfigure
   addresses to MANET nodes [9].  Most of solutions exploit either an
   independent algorithm and messages [5] or a mechanism combined with
   underlying MANET routing protocol [6].  But they still have some
   drawbacks.  First, they introduce significant load like message full-
   flooding over a MANET.  Second, they are coupled with the routig
   protocol and have more complex structure.

   This document describes a mechanism of address autoconfiguration for
   a hybrid MANET, called `Hybrid MANET Address Autoconfiguration'
   (HAA).  The mechanism is intended to minimize message full-flooding.
   HAA autoconfigures IPv6 addresses to MANET nodes by using IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [2-3] with some options and
   messages newly defined here.  After this autoconfiguration process,
   each mobile node has two types of addresses: MANET-local address and
   global-scope address.

2. Terminology

   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

      The process to determine the uniqueness of an address to be
      configured.  If any node has already used the same address, the
      node that has performed DAD process must select another address
      and then execute DAD process again.

   Hybrid MANET

      A MANET with a connection to the Internet is refered to as a
      hybrid MANET.  Such a connectivity is provided by one or more
      Internet Gateways.  Every node in hybrid MANET can have multiple
      addresses to be accessible to variable scope of networks.

   MANET-local Address

      An address used in MANET-scope communications.  Internet gateways
      do not forward the packets that have MANET-local addresses as
      their destination addresses.  Unique local IPv6 unicast addresses
      (ULA) [10] can be used easily as MANET-local addresses.

   Global-scope Address

      An address used in MANET- and global-scope communications.  The
      general format of IPv6 global-scope addresses is defined in IPv6
      Address Architecture [11].  With this type of addresses, every
      node in hybrid MANET can access to another node in the MANET and
      to any host in the Internet.

   Hybrid MANET Address Autoconfiguration (HAA)

      The mechanism that configures MANET-local address and global-scope
      address to the nodes in a MANET.  Because each node has the
      information about Internet gateway and next hop toward the gateway
      and Internet gateway maintains the information of MANET nodes,
      MANET-wide message broadcasting can be avoided.

   Internet Gateway (IG)

      The relaying node that provides Internet connectivity with the

Internet-Draft                     HAA                      October 2006


      MANET nodes.  IG also performs MANET-scope DAD by maintaining the
      list of its MANET nodes.  In addition, IG allocates global-scope
      addresses to the nodes in the MANET.

   Default Node (DN)

      If a node has one or more HAA messages to be delivered to
      corresponding IG, the node direct all messages to `Default Node'.
      Only one of the node's neighbors can be a default node.  This DN
      information is independent of any routing protocol.

   HAA Path

      If a node wants to exchange address autoconfiguration messages
      with its corresponding IG, the node sends the message to its
      default node, one of its one-hop neighbors.  The next hop node
      then forwards this message to its default node repeatedly.  As a
      result, the message is delivered to the IG.  `HAA path' is the
      chain of default nodes among the IG and the nodes. HAA path is
      regarded as a tree path that has IG as its root.

   NDP Global Address Solicitation (GS)

      This is a newly defined message here to deliver each node's
      request for the allocation of global-scope address and MANET-scope
      DAD.

   NDP Global Address Advertisement (GA)

      This is a newly defined message here to deliver IG's response of
      each node's GS message.  This contains the information about
      global-scope address to be allocated, or an error if necessary.

3. IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration for Hybrid MANETs

3.1. Link-local DAD

   If a new node A joins a MANET, the node A makes its own link-local
   scope address, and then determines the duplication of the address.
   To detect address duplication, the node A broadcasts NDP `Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS)' message to all of 1-hop neighbors.  If there is
   not any NDP `Neighbor Advertisement (NA)' message for a period of
   time, the node A uses the link-local scope address to get a global-
   scope address.

   If there are one or more NDP NA messages, the node A makes a new
   link-local scope address with a 64-bit long random value as a node ID
   according to IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SAA) [3].
   Then the node A retries the link-local DAD by sending again a NDP NS
   message containing the new link-local address.

3.2. Default Node Selection

   If a newly joined node A fixes its link-local address, then it tries
   to get the information about the MANET's Internet gateway and default
   node.  For this, the node A sends NDP `Router Solicitation (RS)'
   message to all of 1-hop neighbors.

   Each neighbor that receives the node A's RS message responses with
   NDP `Router Advertisement (RA)' message like a router of wired
   networks.  In this RA message, a newly defined 'Default Node' option
   is attached.  This option containes the addresses of Internet gateway
   and default node (e.g. the sender of this message), the path length
   measured in hop counts between the Internet gateway and the default
   node, and the lifetime of the information about default node.

   The node A then receives one or more RA messages.  It selects one
   among these messages by searching the address of Internet gateway and
   hop counts.  For example, if node B, C, and D send RA messages and
   the node B's RA message has the shortest hop counts to the
   corresponding IG, the node A selects the RA message generated by the
   node B.

   If there is no RA message during a period of T_WAIT_RA seconds, then
   the node A retries to send RS message.  If there is still no RS

   message during N_RETRY_RS times retrial, then the node A stops HAA
   process.

3.3. HAA path

   If the node A gets the addresses of Internet gateway and default
   node, it participates in `HAA path'.  At the begining of building a
   hybrid MANET, there is one node that is Internet gateway as
   infrastructure providing Internet connectivity.  When there is not
   any user node except Internet gateway, a newly joined node does DAD
   with Internet gateway and gets the Internet gateway's address as a
   default node.  As the following nodes are joined, each of nodes takes
   the former node's address as a default node.  As a result, HAA path
   becomes a tree path that has Internet gateway as its root.

   The HAA path is used for the porpose of address autoconfiguration
   only.  Each node's path toward Internet gateway is independent of any
   routing protocol, but this HAA path infomation can be used by a
   routing protocol if needed.

3.4. MANET-scope DAD and Global-scope Address Configuration

   Once a node A acquires the information about Internet gateway and
   default node, it can request the allocation of global-scope address
   by sending `Global Solicitation (GS)' message to Internet gateway.
   GS message is newly defined here as an extension to IPv6 NDP.  This
   message has the `Node Address' option that contains the address of
   the node A.  GS message is forwarded to the default node of each node
   repeatedly, along the HAA path.

   If the HAA path contains the loop by the mobility of some nodes, GS
   message will be silently dropped when its hop limit is decreased to
   0.  Then the node can detect the loop, and change or remove the
   invalid default node.  If the loop is created in transient, the loop
   path is fixed before the GS message's hop limit becomes 0.

   If Internet gateway receives the NDP GS message, then it performs
   MANET-scope DAD by comparing the node A's address contained in GS
   message to the addresses from the list of registered nodes.

   If there is no duplicate address used by the node A's, then Internet
   gateway sends NDP `Global Advertisement (GA)' message.  This message

Internet-Draft                     HAA                      October 2006


   is defined as an extension to NDP like GS message.  It contains the
   global-scope address to be allocated to the node A, and the length of
   prefix of its address.  If the node A receives the message, then the
   node sets its address to the global-scope address.

   If an address duplication is detected, then Internet gateway sends
   the global-scope address allocation error message instead.  This
   message uses the form of NDP GA message, but sets bit E to 1.  If the
   node A receives that, it generates a new address and try again.

   Both GS and GA messages traverse along HAA path and are unicast
   messages.  And message broadcasts are limited to 1-hop range, so the
   message overhead due to the HAA mechanism is relatively low.

3.5. Autoconfiguration without Internet Gateway

   A MANET can lose its gateway if all nodes of the MANET are moved out
   of the radio range of the gateway.  By the absence of the gateway,
   allocation of global-scope address and its DAD procedure, and
   Internet connectivity become unavailable.  If any node in the MANET
   cannot receive periodical GA messages from the gateway, it stops the
   use of its global-scope addresses and disconnects the sessions that
   were created using global-scope addresses previously.  In contrary,
   the node keeps its own MANET-local address.  Abitrary nodes can join
   to and leave from gateway-less MANET, so periodical DAD process for
   MANET-local address is required.  But MANET-local addresses use the
   format of Unique local address (ULA), that is combined with pre-
   defined prefix for MANET and interface identifier built from EUI-64.
   Hence, optimistic DAD [12] can be used for the check of duplication
   of MANET-local addresses.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not describe any security facility of the hybrid
   address autoconfiguration.  A malicious node may block the process by
   misdirecting some of the HAA messages, or make a newly joined node
   configure its address with invalid information.
