  DMS: Dynamic Inter- and Intra-Domain Mobility Support Framework for
                     Information Centric Networking
                     draft-azgin-icnrg-mobility-00

Abstract

   The objective of this proposal is to introduce a mobility support
   framework for information centric networking (ICN) that is capable of
   supporting dynamic mobility scenarios associated with both consumer
   and producer applications, in a mobile device connected to a wireless
   LAN or WAN point of attachment (PoA).  Due to rapidly evolving user
   trends that shift towards increased mobility and increased access to
   mobile content delivery (as both content producer and consumer), it
   is essential for an ICN architecture to offer active mobility support
   to end hosts, and present them with varying degrees of quality of
   experience.  We enable this through the use of a network-driven
   mobility support architecture, which operates in a distributed and
   anchorless manner, and relies on late-binding and in--band signaling
   with the use of forwarding labels.

1.  Introduction

   Mobility support for information centric networking (ICN), with
   specific emphasis on content-centric networking (CCN) [CCN],
   continues to be a critical research area [MOB12] [MOB16] to ensure
   its viability in diverse and dynamic networking environments, while

   offering an acceptable quality of service (QoS) to mobile users as
   good as or better than the current solutions.  Default mobility
   support in CCN is a best-effort service that relies on its pull-based
   design using request-data primitives, with end hosts receiving
   content objects after making a request for them by sending Interest
   messages towards the source.  In this design, consumer mobility is
   handled reactively, as the consumer re-expresses interests by making
   retransmission requests for the dropped (or undelivered) content
   objects due to the host's mobility, with in-network caching helping
   to speed up recovery, however, with no guarantees on service quality
   such as packet loss or content delivery latency.

   Support for producer mobility, on the other hand, is not included by
   design, as the default approach to re-discover producer's location
   after a handover would trigger a timeout-based broadcast storm, which
   would be unrealistic in practical scenarios.  For this reason,
   multiple approaches have been proposed to offer such support
   [KITE][FWLRP][ANCLS] and provide some guarantees for end user
   experience, as the lack of it can create significant issues [NDNMS].
   These solutions have focused on handling producer mobility using
   various designs: (i) an anchor based solution [KITE] with requests
   being forwarded through network or application specific anchor
   points, (ii) a network-driven locator-based solution that separates
   persistent application and topological network identifier namespaces
   while relying on the late-binding technique [FWLRP], and (iii) an
   anchorless host-driven design [ANCLS] with the mobile node
   responsible for notifying the network of its movements to trigger
   temporary updates on data plane.  Host or user entity (UE) driven
   mobility mechanisms such as [KITE] and [ANCLS] offer poor support to
   achieve a make-before-break solution, as the path correction in these
   mechanisms is only possible after the UE attaches to the new PoA,
   while network driven solution can proactively start forwarding the
   Interests from the UE's old location to the new one immediately after
   it learns about the UE's detachment process.

   There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these earlier
   solutions, however, to address the specific application needs by
   offering performance guarantees to them in a scalable manner, we
   believe a network-driven solution is needed [MAAS].  Furthermore, to
   provide a complete mobility solution for ICN with similar performance
   guarantees, we cannot rely on the default CCN architecture, as the
   level of mobility support offered by CCN is minimal, at best.
   Therefore, we need solutions that can offer performance guarantees in
   regards to latency and throughput, regardless of the type of
   application a host runs, be it consumer or producer.  The
   architecture we propose here achieves this objective by using a
   comprehensive mobility framework that combines active producer
   mobility support with active consumer mobility support.  Proposed

   approach takes advantage of locator-driven forwarding with the use of
   forwarding label [I-D.ravi-icnrg-ccn-forwarding-label], which is an
   optional hop-by-hop header carried within the Interest messages to
   identify a topological name (i.e., a network domain, or a network
   host).  As a result, proposed approach can offer seamless mobility
   support to end hosts.

2.  Related Work

2.1.  Consumer Mobility

   Existing research on consumer mobility support for CCN/NDN is limited
   due to its limited impact on the performance, as the default best-
   effort approach considered for CCN/NDN can offer some limited
   guarantees.  Available research on consumer mobility can typically be
   categorized as proactive solution or reactive solution.  Proactive
   approach can target upcoming mobility events to for instance cache
   content at nearby locations for faster access to content, before the
   handover takes place.  On the other hand, reactive approach is
   triggered after a handover takes place.  Default CCN/NDN approach
   falls in the latter category.

   For instance, [MOBINDN] uses a centralized architecture to support
   host mobility, which, during/after handover, updates forwarding table
   entries corresponding to request namespaces to create a shorter
   retransmission path for the consumer requests from the new point of
   attachment to the old one.  The approach considered in [CMOB16] uses
   prediction on consumer location to detect handover events and
   estimate its location at future time points.  The approach also
   predicts which Interest packets will be dropped during a handover,
   and proactively cache Data packets associated with them at nearby
   routers so as to reduce retrieval latency after a successful
   handover.

   Even though the existing approaches can offer faster access to Data
   packets that can improve the perceived quality of experience, no
   guarantees can be offered to ensure certain quality requirements are
   met, as network support is limited.

2.2.  Producer Mobility

   To improve the performance associated with Producer mobility in NDN/
   CCN-based ICN architectures, various approaches have been proposed,
   and these approaches can be grouped into three categories:

   o  First, we have anchor-based solutions [KITE], where requests are
      forwarded through designated nodes (i.e., network or application
      specific nodes) that keep a record of mobile node movements or



Azgin & Ravindran        Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


      provide a path towards it.  As path setup requires setting up and
      maintaining traces within the network, such an approach can
      introduce significant signaling and state overhead.  Furthermore,
      gradual updates may prevent support for seamless mobility and the
      use of application-specific anchors can regularly lead to
      excessive path stretches.

   o  Second, we have anchor-less mobility solutions [ANCLS], where the
      mobile node is responsible for notifying the network of its
      movements by, for instance, triggering temporary updates on data
      plane.  In [ANCLS], temporary FIB entries are created at the
      routers to override the default forwarding strategy to forward
      packets towards the mobile Producer.  However, as the approach
      relies on existing schemes to provide route updates and name
      resolution, local updates triggered by mobile handovers
      continually result in local routing churn, while the global
      routing convergence creates more instability in the forwarding
      paths.  As the number of mobile hosts increases with increased
      traffic rate, scalability and global routing convergence can be a
      major concern.  Furthermore, such an approach would require full
      support from the network to temporarily override the existing FIB
      entries, which may only be possible when appropriate security
      mechanisms to handle such signaling are applied.  In such case,
      seamless mobility cannot be guaranteed.

   o  Third, we have late-binding approaches [MAAS], which relies on
      splitting the application and network identifier namespaces, and
      where dedicated nodes that keep track of mobile movements are used
      to resolve content or device prefixes or identifiers to locators,
      which are then used as forwarding label to forward the requests.
      For instance, [MAAS] utilizes dedicated controllers in combination
      with in-band signaling that takes advantage of Interest-Data
      symmetric routing within each domain to handle name resolution
      management.  The local controllers can communicate with other
      controllers (such as home controllers) to handle inter-domain
      mobility.  While this approach mitigates path stretch issue, it
      does increase the signaling overhead due to mobile end points.
      Furthermore, controllers can become a bottleneck as the failure of
      a local controller would lead to either temporary disconnects or
      increased overheads.  Lastly, even though [MAAS] can support
      seamless Producer mobility with minimal path stretch, it requires
      architectural changes that can go beyond what might be considered
      for [KITE] and [ANCLS] as incremental upgrades to support seamless
      mobility.

3.  Mobility Requirements

   Locator identifier split can be considered as an important
   requirement to handle mobility at the network layer [SEAML], which
   can inherently be supported by the ICN architectures (such as
   MobilityFirst [MFRST]) due to unique names assigned to each entity
   and routing on names to resolve locations using a global name
   resolution system along with delay tolerant networking (DTN) features
   such as hop-by-hop forward and store, and late-binding, to achieve
   seamless connectivity.  There are some limitations to achieve these
   objectives efficiently with the current IP through the use of
   protocols based on Mobile IP, due to using IP address both as a
   locator and as an identifier, triangular routing and the associated
   control overhead [RFC6301].

   In CCN/NDN based architectures, using hierarchical identifiers for
   routing cannot scale due to potentially explosive growth in
   namespaces and the reduced aggregatability of these namespaces with
   increased mobility, multi-homing, or resource replication [NCMP].
   Furthermore, practical problems such as name-suffix hole may arise
   when names are used for network reachability.  Routing scalability is
   typically achieved by designing names with aggregatable property,
   which is the case for IP today.  However, having such feature in CCN/
   NDN would lead to relinquishing the persistency of names, as the
   names would involve a topological component for scalability (which
   also suggests resources to be renamed depending on, for instance,
   network or business specs or characteristics).  Furthermore,
   overloading an identifier as a locator can lead to unstable routing
   control and forwarding plane operations.

   Locator identifier split in CCN/NDN therefore imposes splitting the
   hierarchical namespace to support routable, persistent and human-
   friendly names.  In such case, names would be divided based on
   application binding vs. advertised network entities in control plane
   to improve the scalability of routing.  For instance, persistent
   identifiers, which would be used to create secure content objects,
   can be published by multiple content distributers, where they would
   then be mapped to different locators to resolve the content names to
   specific infrastructure entities.  The fundamental requirement with
   this form of splitting is no different than that of MobilityFirst or
   LISP [RFC6830], which is the requirement of a name resolution system
   (NRS) to map the two namespaces.

   In addition to the locator identifier split, we can summarize the
   general requirements for CCN/NDN based architectures to support
   efficient packet forwarding involving mobile hosts as follows:

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   o  Forwarding scalability: The size for the forwarding tables should
      be independent of the number of mobile entities and the level of
      mobility experienced by these entities.  This requirement can be
      met by requiring to keep object state only at the edges (i.e.,
      gateways), and perform routing at the core network based on the
      locator prefixes.

   o  Control overhead: Network updates triggered by mobility should be
      local rather than global, and they should not affect the
      convergence of routing/forwarding.  This requirement can be met by
      using a localized mobility controllers (within each domain/AS)
      that is capable of resolving namespaces corresponding to mobile
      entities using the corresponding home bindings.

   o  Intra- and Inter-session mobility: Mobility support architecture
      should be capable of supporting both intra-session mobility (e.g.,
      changing access point or mobility service node during an active
      communication instance) and inter-session mobility (e.g.,
      reconnecting after timeout or session expiry).  We can support
      inter-session mobility through reactive discovery by communicating
      with a mobility controller associated with the mobile entity's
      namespace (i.e., home mobility controller, to which the mobile is
      registered globally for its namespace and which provides global
      resolution on such registered namespaces) to request an update.
      We can support intra-session mobility through active tracking of
      the mobile entity's movements, for instance, using proactive
      signaling by the mobile entity to trigger update at all the
      related ICN forwarders along the reverse Data path signaling to
      re-resolve the namespace for the mobile entity to the correct
      locator.

   o  Mobility granularity: Since supporting mobility may incur
      increased signaling and communication overhead, it should be
      realizable as a service, on-demand and for a subset of the mobile
      entities (e.g., hosts/namespaces subscribed to the mobility
      service).  Granularity for the mobility service can be further
      adjusted with respect to the geographical span of mobility
      support, and latency, etc.

4.  Design Components

4.1.  Mobility Service and Components

   While the proposed solution can be applied to all Interest flows in a
   mobile network, it can also be selectively enabled to only mobile
   producers.  For this, our architecture relies on the use of mobility
   service for matching entities (such as hosts, service, or content
   name prefixes).  The presence of mobility service is identified using



Azgin & Ravindran        Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   one of the following approaches: (i) with the use of Mobility Service
   flag carried within the Interest which can be set by the end hosts or
   ICN-enabled point of attachments (default approach for our
   architecture), (ii) by prepending the content name prefix with the
   Mobility Service tag, or (iii) by provisioning traffic policy rules
   at the ICN service routers to monitor for Interest flows with pre-
   configured names matching a prefix of the Interest (or by checking
   the Interest's attributes to distinguish flows requiring seamless
   mobility support).  If mobility service is enabled on a namespace,
   DMS protocols are used on the received Interests or forwarded Data
   packets to provide seamless mobility support for the matching flows.
   If mobility service is not enabled, regular CCN/NDN processing logic
   is used on the received Interests or Data packets, by going through
   the default CS/PIT/FIB processing.

4.2.  Forwarding Label and Components

   To realize ID/locator split in CCN, we use the forwarding label (FL)
   object that acts as a locator and provides the flexibility to forward
   Interests on a name other than the one provided within the original
   Interest, while allowing the ability to modify it on-the-fly
   [I-D.ravi-icnrg-ccn-forwarding-label].  Proposed FL-object helps with
   not only mobility but also with opportunistic routing, binding
   Interests to services at a given location, and in-network computing,
   thereby allowing for incremental enhancement over CCN to provide
   richer and optimized service aware routing at the network edge.

   FL objects are considered as container objects that include locator
   identifier, service specific metadata (i.e., contextual information
   on the application/service to help the network triggering appropriate
   FL processing such as trust validation) and (optional) security
   attributes for authentication.  Locator identifier is considered as a
   hierarchically structured topological name representing a domain, a
   gateway, or host identifiers.

   FL objects are inserted within the Interest either by the consuming
   application (which may require a trust binding between the content
   identifier or prefix and the locator identifier) or by the network
   (which typically occur at the ingress service routers, if the
   Interest satisfies an existing flow service profile).  As an FL
   object can be modified within the network (e.g., at domain
   boundaries, network edges, etc.), it is considered as part of the
   optional hop-by-hop header.  In regards to processing of FL-object
   carrying Interests, various options are available depending on
   service profiles and trust relationships, e.g., locator identifier
   preference (over content identifier), content identifier preference
   (over locator identifier), locator identifier preference with swap,
   or locator identifier ignore.

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   For efficient utility and processing of FL objects, a separate data
   structure is introduced at the ICN nodes, referred as the Forwarding
   Label Table (FLT), which carries locator/identifier cache mappings
   for supported flows.  Packet processing logic for the FLT
   corresponding to mobile flows is similar to that of FIB, which
   suggests longest prefix matching on the carried content identifiers
   to extract the locator information, which is then used for exact
   match on the FIB.  Also note that, utilization of FL objects is not
   limited to mobile flows, as they can also be used to provide fast
   forwarding path such as off-path caching on supported flows.

4.3.  Distributed Mobility Controller and Components

   Distributed Mobility Controllers (DMCs) are localized service nodes
   within domains to handle mobility support for subscribed or visiting
   mobile entities.  DMC nodes operate in a decentralized manner to
   resolve content/host identifiers to locators.  These nodes use a
   Local Registration Database (LDB) to store name to locator mappings
   retrieved through local registrations (e.g., for visiting mobile
   entities) and/or remote registrations (e.g., for member mobile
   entities).  DMC nodes also communicate with other DMC nodes in
   different domains, using Route Request (RREQ) and Route Response
   (RRES) messages, to discover current locator information on mobile
   entities.  DMC nodes are also responsible for updating the service
   points and gateway nodes within their domain for localized name-to-
   locator mappings.

5.  DMS Protocol Design

   Leveraging ICN's name-based mobility, the proposed architecture
   allows any meaningful space of the name hierarchy to be mobile.  End
   hosts enable this by actively registering the associated namespace to
   the network, where the mobility service enabled by the provider
   allows the entities in another domain under the namespace to be
   accessible anywhere on the Internet.  This motivates a scalable
   mobility architecture.  The proposed solution achieves this objective
   by utilizing four essential building blocks: Distributed Mobility
   Controllers (DMCs) to provide name-to-locator mappings and manage
   control overhead, Forwarding Label Table (FLT)s, which are used by
   the designated routers to control information flow in the network) to
   address forwarding scalability, Forwarding Labels and Mobility Tags
   to address inter- and intra-session mobility at different mobility
   granularities.

   Proposed architecture considers a basic networking hierarchy, which
   consists of a given number of domains or Autonomous Systems (AS).
   Each domain/AS is assigned a DMC carrying a domain designated prefix.
   DMCs are responsible for mapping local and remote entity names to



Azgin & Ravindran        Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   domain/router identifiers.  If the entity is local (which is the case
   for intra-domain delivery), DMC resolves the names to ISRs, whereas,
   if the entity is remote (which is the case for inter-domain
   delivery), DMC maps the names to local domain's egress router
   identifier.  Each host is statically or dynamically assigned to a
   designated DMC (also referred as Home-DMC), which stores up-to-date
   resolution information regarding its users.

   Assuming the use of hierarchical identifiers, each host is assigned a
   unique identifier representing the association of a user to its home
   network.  The aggregate identifier (including network and host
   identifiers) is only needed during Registration.  Network identifier,
   for an endpoint, is not considered a priori requirement to support
   successful location discovery.  Using an identifier, however, is the
   preferred choice to minimize control overhead.

   DMCs are assumed to have access to information directly related to
   communication taking place within its domain (e.g., Home DMC or
   locator associated with content published within the domain by
   current registered hosts).  Hence, no direct synchronization is
   assumed to exist among the DMCs.  Active domain information on
   visiting hosts is flushed on a regular basis, as soon as the
   registered host leave the domain under DMC's control, to minimize
   access to outdated information.  However, Remote-DMCs are allowed to
   store information on Home-DMCs representing the visiting hosts for
   longer periods to minimize overhead associated with the initial
   discovery (i.e., an ISR requesting a mapping for a consumer residing
   in Remote-DMC's domain on a previously hosted Producer's prefix, or
   during decentralized discovery responding with information on Home-
   DMC to a request from another domain's DMC).

   In this architecture, forwarding labels are utilized to route packets
   in a controlled manner.  Forwarding label is similar to content
   prefix in the sense that, when used, it provides sufficient
   information on the next physical or logical hop.  However, unlike a
   content prefix, forwarding label is used as a dynamic tag within the
   Interest that is regularly updated (at the service routers and
   gateway points) along the path to content source.  To support the use
   of forwarding labels, at each service or edge router or PoA, we
   utilize an FLT that carries the mappings corresponding to content
   prefixes and forwarding addresses.

   Since handling mobility with FLT and forwarding labels incurs
   additional memory and computational costs, forwarding decisions based
   on FLT are limited to traffic tagged as being part of the mobility
   service, whereas for other traffic, default routing based on FIB is
   used.  Therefore, any mobile host that wishes to use the mobility
   service indicates its intent during the registration by setting a

   single-bit mobility service tag (MS-tag) contained within the
   registration message.  Consumers can also enable this tag along with
   the mobile entity's unique name to invoke the mobility service, which
   would help ISRs to differentiate between mobile and non-mobile
   entities.  In scenarios where the mobility service is not explicitly
   defined, forwarding is strictly based on the core CCN/NDN policies.
   Note that, the use of mobility service also allows the use of in-
   network caching and look-up based on the available FIB entries.

6.  DMS Implementation

   In this section, we explain the general operations for the proposed
   DMS architecture in regards to (i) how the namespaces are registered
   for faster resolution and delivery, (ii) how the content is delivered
   from/to mobile end hosts, and (iii) the operations involved during a
   handover.

           Figure 1: Basic view for the mobility support architecture


   We start by assuming that the Producer publishes content under
   namespace /Prefix, and the end hosts learn the minimum control name
   space needed to interact with the access points (or PoAs) during
   mobile attachment.  Figure 1 illustrates the basic topology.  Here,
   ISRs can be considered as the service points for the end hosts
   connected to PoA(s) under each.

   Step(1): Registration Phase initiates with Producer sending a
   Register (REG) message for its content, under namespace /Prefix, to
   the current host domain's DMC (e.g., CurrentDMC).  REG message
   includes the complete identifier for the Producer's namespace,
   including the bindings for it: /Prefix:/HomeAS/ProducerID, where

   /HomeAS/ProducerID represents the home binding identifier for the
   entity /Prefix, with /HomeAS representing the identifier for
   Producer's home domain.  Here, for instance, /ProducerID can be the
   device identifier, and if the device itself is mobile then
   /ProducerID can be considered as part of /Prefix, in which case
   /HomeAS would be sufficient for the home binding.  We place no
   restriction on /Prefix as for it to be globally routable or not, as
   it is resolved using the decentralized DMC-driven infrastructure.  To
   complete registration, Producer sends a REG message to its PoA (e.g.,
   PoA1) with the prefix /PoA1/REG used as a forwarding label, which is
   then forwarded using the existing forwarding table (FIB/FLT) entries
   towards CurrentDMC through PoA1 and its service point (e.g., ISR1).
   Note that, Producer can also send the registration message directly
   to DMC by using /DMC/REG (in which case, on-path nodes would decide
   accordingly to register).  After receiving the REG message, ISR1 also
   updates the forwarding label by including its identifier within
   packet header to inform CurrentDMC on the identity of the service
   point (or ISR) associated with the Producer's to-be-registered
   namespace.  After CurrentDMC receives the REG message, if the MS-tag
   is set within the request to indicate a request for mobility support,
   CurrentDMC's local registration database (LDB) is updated with the
   entry /Prefix::/ISR1::/HomeAS (through insertion of a new entry or
   modification of an existing entry), where the third component
   specifies the home domain for /Prefix.  Here, FLT in the PoA or LDB
   in the DMC by default require at least two inputs, corresponding to
   the prefix and locator information.  For the sake of presentation
   here, we use double colon to separate these entries.  Additionally,
   if the MS-tag is set within the forwarded REG message, FLT tables at
   the on-path POA1 and ISR1 are also updated by inserting the
   corresponding mappings targeting /ProducerID at the PoA1, and /PoA1
   at ISR1.  Specifically, this is done by adding the entry
   /Prefix::/Producer to FLT table at PoA1, and the entry /Prefix::/PoA1
   to FLT table at ISR1, upon receiving the acknowledgement message from
   CurrentDMC.

   Step(2): Proactive Update Phase initiates with CurrentDMC sending a
   Route Update (RUPD) message to the ingress routers within CurrentAS
   to update their FLT tables with the entry /Prefix::/ISR1 so that any
   Interest received by the ingress nodes targeting the namespace
   /Prefix can be immediately forwarded to ISR1.  At the ingress
   routers, in addition to proactive updates, we can also use reactive
   updates, which would be triggered after (i) a first request arrival,
   in which case the ingress router would make a request for the
   forwarding information after receiving an Interest under namespace
   /Prefix, for which no entry exists within the ingress router's
   forwarding tables; or (ii) receiving a mobility update on data plane,
   with information carried within returned Data packets.  However, the
   reactive update phase may require the initial traffic to be forwarded
   to the CurrentDMC to minimize latency, which would act as a temporary
   anchor, hence introduce additional overhead to keep track of entries
   to avoid sending recurring route requests for the non-local
   Producers.  For this reason, by default, we limit DMC to function
   specifically as a resolution server, rather than offering a
   combination of resolution and anchor functionalities.

   Step(3): Home Registration Phase initiates with CurrentDMC sending to
   DMC within Producer's HomeAS (HomeDMC) a Home-Register (HREG) message

   for /Prefix using the complete identifier information for the
   Producer.  We can use the following as the prefix for the HREG
   message: /HomeAS/DMC/HREG, which assumes /DMC to be a globally shared
   anycast identifier within a domain.  After HomeDMC receives the HREG
   message, it updates its LDB accordingly; (i) if an active entry is
   found in HomeDMC's LDB for Producer, corresponding to a different
   domain, the entry is updated to represent the domain change as
   follows: /Prefix::/Remote:CurrentDomainID::/Remote:PreviousDomainID,
   with the first component representing the mobile entity's namespace,
   the second component pointing to /CurrentAS and the third component
   pointing to the previous domain the Producer was visiting (e.g.,
   /PreviousAS).  Additionally, HomeDMC sends a Flush-Register (FREG)
   message to the PreviousDMC using the identifier /PreviousAS/DMC to
   timeout the existing entries while re-directing on-the-fly traffic to
   the current domain Producer is visiting; (ii) if no active entry is
   found in HomeDMC's LDB for Producer, then HomeDMC's LDB is updated
   with the entry /Prefix::/Remote:CurrentDomainID::/.

6.1.2.  Consumer Mobility

   We start by assuming that the Consumer is assigned a unique
   identifier /ConsumerID.

   Step(1): Upon connecting to a network, Consumer sends a local
   registration request (LREG message) towards a matching entity as
   assigned by the hosting domain to register at the point of attachment
   (PoA2) or the service point (ISR2) using its identifier /ConsumerID
   (which could be a device ID, or a set of service IDs if service level
   mobility is requested) by requesting mobility service support from
   the network.  The ConsumerID is also appended to the Interest, but
   its scope is limited only to the link between the consumer and the
   PoA.

   Step(2): Upon receiving the LREG message, PoA2 or ISR2 registers
   /ConsumerID within its FLT to include information on the Consumer,
   such as its identifier, interface identifier, and any associated
   forwarding label.

6.2.  Content Delivery Phase

   In this section, we present the default content delivery for the
   proposed architecture in the case of no handover.

   Step(1): Consumer starts Content Delivery Phase by sending an
   Interest for /Prefix to its PoA (PoA2), while including its host
   identifier /ConsumerID within the request.  We assume the request is
   a fresh request, with no existing entry within PIT or a matching
   content within CS along the path towards the Producer.  If one
   exists, default CCN/NDN operations would take place (i.e., if PIT
   entry exists, aggregate by including /ConsumerID, if content exists,
   respond with it).  We also assume PoA acts as the service point for
   the end host with mobility service installed.

   Step(2): PoA2 checks its CS and PIT to find a matching entry for
   /Prefix, and finds no match.  PoA2 creates an entry within its PIT
   for the request to also include /ConsumerID.  PoA2 forwards the
   Interest to its service point (ISR2) after removing /ConsumerID.
   After receiving the Interest, ISR2 performs a more detailed check
   including searching for FLT (and, if necessary FIB) entries.  If no
   entry is found, ISR2 creates a Route-Request (RREQ) message with the
   prefix /DMC/RREQ and sends it to its local DMC.  Furthermore, ISR2
   updates its local request waiting list (LRWL) for the request
   messages it creates (similar to the PIT entries) to avoid
   retransmitting the same request to its DMC.  Any further Interests
   targeting /Prefix are queued at ISR2 until a response to the first
   RREQ message is received on the given namespace.

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   Step(3): After DMC receives the RREQ message, it searches for a
   matching entry within its LDB.  If an entry is found, request can be
   unicast sent to the HomeDMC for /Prefix.  Similarly, request message
   can be forwarded to HomeDMC, if /Prefix includes a domain-specific
   identifier.  If no entry is found, and the received content name does
   not identify the home binding, then the request would use the
   decentralized DMC infrastructure to identify HomeDMC for /Prefix.
   One approach would be to forward the RREQ message to all the other
   DMCs.  We can reduce the discovery overhead by using a controlled
   name-based multicast, by grouping multiple requests into a single
   Interest and forwarding the Interest domain by domain until a match
   is found.  However, in practice, we can expect such home mapping to
   be provided at the time of request.  Also, similar to how it was with
   ISR2, DMC also implements a LRWL for the received RREQ messages, to
   suppress discovery attempts associated with new requests targeting
   the same namespace.

   Step(4): After HomeDMC receives the RREQ message, a Route-Response
   (RRES) message is created in response to the request with the mapping
   /Prefix::/CurrentAS that identifies the current location for the
   Producer.  Note that, if the response message is forwarded along
   trusted domains, such responses can also be cached within on-path
   domains to improve discovery timeframe for future requests.

   Step(5): After Consumer side DMC receives HomeDMC's RRES message to
   its RREQ message, DMC first updates its LDB with the entry
   /Prefix::/CurrentAS::/HomeAS, identifying the current location for
   the Producer and its home domain.  DMC also creates a Data packet in
   response to the received RREQ messages and alerts any ISR nodes
   indicated by the LRWL entry associated with /Prefix, before removing
   any such entries.  For the given scenario, DMC responds to ISR2's
   RREQ message by creating a RRES message with the mapping
   /Prefix::/CurrentAS::/ER1, by also including information on the
   preferred egress point (ER1), to which the ISR2 needs to forward the
   Interest messages.  Note that, by default, such mapping information
   may readily be available at the ISR nodes within their FIB.

   Step(6): After ISR2 receives the RRES message corresponding to its
   earlier request, ISR2 also updates its FLT with the following entry:
   /Prefix::/CurrentAS, while updating its FIB with the entry
   /CurrentAS::/ER1.  ISR2 then clears its LRWL entry for /Prefix and
   starts forwarding the matching Interests using the forwarding label
   /ER1/CurrentAS (with first destination being /ER1 and final
   destination residing in /CurrentAS).

   Step(7): After ER1 receives an Interest carrying a forwarding label,
   it extracts the forwarding label to determine the next hop.  In the
   current scenario, ER1 determines itself as the first destination,



Azgin & Ravindran        Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   checks for the next destination and identifies it as /CurrentAS.
   Assuming that the ERs have already populated their FIBs with domain-
   based mappings of /RemoteAS::/NextHop, ER1 can set the received
   Interest's forwarding label to /NextHop/CurrentAS before forwarding
   it to /NextHop.  This process is repeated until the Interest is
   received by the ingress router at CurrentAS.

   Step(8): After the ingress router at CurrentAS receives the Interest,
   it determines that the target for the received Interest resides
   within its domain.  Ingress router then uses its FLT to determine the
   address for the ISR servicing the PoA connected to the Producer
   hosting /Prefix.  FLT-based lookup process is repeated at the service
   point and point of attachment, until the Producer receives the
   Interest, after which content delivery towards the Consumer can
   proceed along the reverse path, using CCN/NDN's breadcrumb approach.

   Step(9): After the content object arrives at the PoA2, it searches
   for and extracts to PIT entry to determine (i) the consumer
   identifier, if it exists, and (ii) the interface metrics.  For the
   case that the consumer identifier (/ConsumerID) exists, PoA2 performs
   a lookup on the FLT to find the entry for /ConsumerID to validate the
   interface information.  For the default case, with no handover,
   interface information within FLT entry would be equal to the
   interface metric extracted from the PIT entry, thereby allowing the
   content object to be forwarded using the default forwarding process.

           Figure 4: Producer handover


   Step(1): After the Producer performs a handover from PoA1 to PoA3
   serviced by different ISRs, Producer repeats the registration process
   by sending a REG message to CurrentDMC, as explained earlier.  After
   the CurrentDMC receives the REG message, it looks up for a matching
   entry in its LDB for /Prefix to determine an intra-domain handover,
   from ISR1 to ISR3.  CurrentDMC updates its LDB entry with
   /Prefix::/ISR3::/HomeDMC and initiates a proactive mobility update by
   sending a Route-Update (RUPD) message to the ingress points so that
   these border routers update their FLT tables with the entry
   /Prefix::/ISR3.  CurrentDMC also creates an FREG message and sends it
   to ISR1, which include information on the new service point for
   /Prefix.

   Step(2): After ingress routers receive the RUPD message, they update
   their FLT tables to point to ISR3 for /Prefix and start forwarding
   any matching Interest towards the new ISR associated with /Prefix,
   ISR3.

   Step(3): After ISR1 receives the FREG message for /Prefix, ISR1
   updates its local FLT with the entry /Prefix::/ISR3 and forwards any
   incoming Interest targeting this namespace to ISR3.  Additionally,
   ISR1 also starts a timer to flush out its local FLT entry
   corresponding to /Prefix when the timer expires.  ISR1 also forwards

   the FREG message to PoA1, which flushes its FLT entry upon receiving.
   Note that, even though PoA1 can timeout its FLT entry after a
   handover notification from Producer, FREG allows confirmation from
   CurrentDMC of a successful registration after handover.

           Figure 5: Consumer handover


   Consumer mobility requires a more proactive approach as the mobile
   host is the one triggering the content request.

   Step(1): As Consumer initiates a handover from PoA2 to PoA4, during
   the handover signaling, PoA2 is informed of the next PoA (or the set
   of candidate PoAs) for the Consumer.

   Step(2): After being informed of the upcoming handover to PoA4, PoA2
   updates the existing FLT entry for the Consumer corresponding to
   /ConsumerID by setting the interface metric to a predefined value
   corresponding to Not_Attached and initializing the forwarding label
   entry to identifier corresponding to PoA4 (/PoA4).  If the next PoA
   information received from Consumer includes a list of candidate PoAs,
   then the FLT entry would include multiple forwarding labels
   corresponding to these PoAs (or a smaller subset of them).

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   Step(3): After the Consumer connects to PoA4, if the Consumer
   requires mobility support from the network, it sends an LREG message
   to PoA4 to register its host identifier (/ConsumerID) at the PoA
   within its FLT.

   Step(4): After Consumer's handover to PoA4, as content objects arrive
   at PoA2, due to Consumer's earlier Interests sent before the
   handover, PoA2 extracts the matching entry from its PIT and
   determines the use of mobility support service by a requesting
   Consumer, which is identified through its host identifier
   /ConsumerID.  PoA2 then uses /ConsumerID to extract the FLT entry and
   determines the forwarding label associated with the requesting host.
   PoA2 then creates a Push-Data (PSHD) type content object, which is a
   special type of data packet that bypasses PIT lookups during packet
   forwarding.  PoA2 then performs FIB lookup on the extracted
   forwarding label (/PoA4), inserts the label within the packet and
   changes its type to PSHD before forwarding it to the next hop towards
   PoA4.

   Step(5): Intermediate nodes that receive the PSHD-type content
   objects, skips CS/PIT processing, and performs FIB lookup on its
   forwarding label to determine the outgoing interface before
   forwarding it to the next hop as indicated by the FIB entry.  The set
   of nodes that do not have a corresponding PIT entry can also save
   this Data packet in their content stores to benefit other consumers.

   Step(6): As the PoA4 receives these PSHD-type content objects, they
   are queued at its CS for later retrieval by the Consumer, if the
   process relies on the Consumer to re-express Interests for these
   content objects.  If the received PSHD-type content objects include
   host identifier, PoA4 can push these content objects to the Consumer
   as soon as the Consumer finishes handover and successfully registers
   at PoA4.  To do that, PoA4 performs a lookup on the FLT to validate
   the registration for the /ConsumerID, before forwarding towards the
   interface as indicated by the corresponding FLT entry.

6.3.2.  Inter-domain Handover

   Step(1): After Producer moves to a new domain, NextAS, the Producer
   initiates the registration phase by sending a new REG message
   upstream towards NextDMC also triggering updates along the path to
   NextDMC, including the PoA4 and ISR4.

   Step(2): NextDMC sends a HREG message to HomeDMC through HomeAS,
   while also sending a RUPD message to ingress points, which update
   their FLT with the entry /Prefix::/ISR4.

Internet-Draft                     DMS                         July 2018


   Step(3): After HomeDMC receives the HREG message, it determines an
   inter-domain handover for the Producer, and sends CurrentDMC an FREG
   message with the prefix /CurrentAS:CurrentDMC/FREG.  HomeDMC also
   includes information on the current domain that Producer is attached
   to CurrentDMC.

   Step(4): After CurrentDMC receives the FREG message, it creates a
   local-scope FREG message and sends it to ISR3.  Next, CurrentDMC
   sends a Route-Update-With-Timeout (RUPDT) message to ingress points
   requiring them to update their FLT entry associated with /Prefix to
   point to /NextAS during the FLT-timeout period.  Anytime an ingress
   point receives an Interest targeting /Prefix with the wrong
   forwarding label during the FLT-timeout interval, the timeout
   parameter is reset to its default value to ensure that any Consumer
   thsat is not aware of a domain change is informed.

   Step(4.1): The forwarding label for the incorrectly labeled Interest
   is updated with the correct forwarding label, and the Interest's
   Mobility-Update tag (MU-tag) is set to 1, before the Interest is
   forwarded towards the nextAS.

   Step(4.2): When Producer receives an Interest with a set MU-tag,
   suggesting that the Consumer side is not aware of Producer's inter-
   domain handover, it sets the MU-tag within the Data packet as well,
   to inform the Consumer side of the inter-domain handover.

   Step(4.3): When ISR2 receives a Data packet with set MU-tag, ISR2 re-
   initiates the Discovery Phase by requesting a forced RUPD from its
   DMC, which then communicates with HomeDMC to acquire the up-to-date
   mapping associated with /Prefix.  Another alternative to the above
   approach is for the Producer to include domain information within its
   Data packets, in response to an Interest with a set MU-tag.

7.  Design Discussions

   In this section, we address the basic design considerations of a
   mobility support architecture in an ICN.

7.1.  Storage Considerations

   FIB represents both the strengths (i.e., flexible operation and on-
   the-fly routing decisions) and the weaknesses (i.e., overhead) of a
   CCN/NDN architecture, with greater perceived impact as the network
   size and content availability increase.  Specifically, ad hoc
   operation allows for greater flexibility during routing, whereas,
   increased storage requirements (with variable prefix names and
   multiple entries per prefix) degrade the forwarding efficiency at




Azgin & Ravindran        Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 22]

   each CCN/NDN enabled router by increasing the processing latency
   [SNDNF].

   FLT addresses some of these drawbacks by partitioning the information
   required for end-to-end packet forwarding at different sections in
   the network.  For instance, prefix-to-locator mappings are stored at
   the local databases (LDBs) within mainly the DMC nodes.  However,
   because of domain-based partitioning of these namespaces, the number
   of entries stored at a given LDB is much smaller than what is
   expected to be stored in the FIB of a CCN/NDN router.  Here, ISRs are
   only responsible for keeping entries of the active hosts they serve,
   rather than keeping entries for the hosts being serviced by the other
   routers.  Ingress/egress points provide the backbone dependent
   mappings and their perceived overhead is limited in the maximum of
   the number of domains and the number of locally hosted Producers
   within a domain.  The intermediate routers, between ISRs and ingress/
   egress points, are only responsible for carrying the mappings
   associated with next hop to reach them, hence not anymore observing
   overhead proportional to the number of hosts being serviced along the
   downstream channel.  As a result, with the proposed architecture, we
   expect noticeable improvement in the processing latency within the
   network to route packets between endpoints.  Specifically, by
   forwarding Interests on the controller-managed locator driven
   address-space, rather than the highly variable prefix-space, lookup
   latency on a typical CCN/NDN router does not anymore depend on the
   prefix length.

7.2.  Scalability Considerations

   For the proposed architecture, another important concern is the
   performance of the controller node, which is expected to service the
   requests of the hosts associated with its domain (hosted consumers,
   or homed entities).  A DMC carries prefix-to-domain mappings for the
   hosted consumers and remote producers and prefix-to-router mappings
   for the hosted producers.  Note that prefix-to-domain mappings are
   updated at a much lower rate (inter-AS handover rate) than the rate
   associated with prefix-to-router mappings, which change at the intra-
   AS handover rate.

7.3.  Security Considerations

   There are various ways an attacker can exploit the possible
   vulnerabilities in our architecture by targeting the distributed
   controllers which can be considered as the entities responsible for
   managing (authorizing, registering, updating) prefix to locator
   mappings.  For instance, by registering non-existing prefixes to the
   DMC as fake producers, or by requesting non-existing prefixes from
   the DMC as fake consumers, attackers can overload the controllers and

   limit access to legitimate requests.  Following are some of the
   possible approaches that can be implemented in such cases to minimize
   the impact of flooding-driven attacks on the overall performance.

7.3.1.  Producer Flooding

   We assumes a producer to include certain information within the
   registration message to identify the producer's home network and
   authenticate the registered content.  Hence, we can limit the scope
   of fake-producer attacks through authentication failure messages
   received from the home networks.  After an authentication failure
   message is received by the host network's DMC, information on the
   fake-producer can be shared with the host network's ISRs, to prevent
   or reduce access to the matching user's registration requests.

7.3.2.  Consumer Flooding

   To prevent an attacker from hijacking the network by sending requests
   for non-existent prefixes, multiple approaches are possible.  First,
   we can employ a threshold-based admission policy at the first point
   of entry for the incoming requests and limit the number of
   outstanding requests that await for the path update from the DMC.
   Our architecture already does this to some extent, by suppressing
   requests targeting the same entity (i.e., Producer) at the ISRs.
   Second, we can use an adaptive decision policy to enforce stricter
   threshold values at certain ISRs depending on the experienced
   overhead at the DMCs.  Since the forwarding label in a request
   message includes information on the entry points, DMCs can aggregate
   the necessary statistics to quickly determine the problematic areas,
   and restrict access whenever needed.  Third, by sending feedbacks to
   ISRs on problematic requests, attackers can be identified in a timely
   manner and the information on them can be shared with other ISRs
   within the same domain to limit the effectiveness of future attacks.
