Abstract

   This document defines format and use principals of the Deterministic
   Network (DetNet) service Associated Channel (ACH) over a DetNet
   network with the MPLS data plane.  The DetNet service ACH can be used
   to carry test packets of active Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance protocols that are used to detect DetNet failures and
   measure performance metrics.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8655] introduces and explains Deterministic Networks (DetNet)
   architecture and how the Packet Replication and Elimination function
   (PREF) can be used to ensure low packet drop ratio in DetNet domain.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) protocols are used
   to detect, localize defects in the network, and monitor network
   performance.  Some OAM functions, e.g., failure detection, work in
   the network proactively, while others, e.g., defect localization,
   usually performed on-demand.  These tasks achieved by a combination
   of active and hybrid, as defined in [RFC7799], OAM methods.

   Also, this document defines format and use principals of the DetNet
   service Associated Channel over a DetNet network with the MPLS data
   plane [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

3.  Active OAM for DetNet Networks with MPLS Data Plane

   OAM protocols and mechanisms act within the data plane of the
   particular networking layer.  And thus it is critical that the data
   plane encapsulation supports OAM mechanisms in such a way to comply
   with the OAM requirements listed in [I-D.tpmb-detnet-oam-framework].
   One of such examples that require special consideration is
   requirement #5:

      DetNet OAM packets MUST be in-band, i.e., follow precisely the
      same path as DetNet data plane traffic both for unidirectional and
      bi-directional DetNet paths.

   The Det Net data plane encapsulation in transport network with MPLS
   encapsulation specified in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  For the MPLS
   underlay network, DetNet flows to be encapsulated analogous to
   pseudowires (PW) over MPLS packet switched network, as described in
   [RFC3985], [RFC4385].  Generic PW MPLS Control Word (CW), defined in
   [RFC4385], for DetNet displayed in Figure 1.

   PREF in the DetNet domain composed by a combination of nodes that
   perform replication and elimination sub-functions.  The elimination
   sub-function always uses the S-Label and packet sequencing
   information, e.g., the value in the Sequence Number field of DetNet
   CW (d-CW).  The replication sub-function uses the S-Label information
   only.  For data packets Figure 2 presents an example of PREF in
   DetNet domain.

   The meanings of the fields in the d-ACH are:

      Bits 0..3 MUST be 0b0001.  This value of the first nibble allows
      the packet to be distinguished from an IP packet [RFC4928] and a
      DetNet data packet [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

      Version: this is the version number of the d-ACH.  This
      specification defines version 0.

Internet-Draft          OAM for DetNet over MPLS              March 2021


      Sequence Number: this is unsigned eight bits-long field.  The
      originating DetNet node MUST set the value of the Sequence Number
      field to a non-zero before packet being transmitted.  The
      originating node MUST monotonically increase the value of the
      Sequence Number field for the every next active OAM packet.

      Channel Type: the value of DetNet Associated Channel Type is one
      of values defined in the IANA PW Associated Channel Type registry.

   The DetNet flow, according to [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls], is identified
   by the S-label that MUST be at the bottom of the stack.  Active OAM
   packet MUST have d-ACH immediately following the S-label.

3.2.  DetNet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Sub-functions
      Interaction with Active OAM

   At the DetNet service layer, special functions MAY be applied to the
   particular DetNet flow - PREF to potentially lower packet loss,
   improve the probability of on-time packet delivery and Packet
   Ordering Function (POF) to ensure in-order packet delivery.  As data
   and the active OAM packets have the same Flow ID, S-label, sub-
   functions that rely on sequencing information in the DetNet service
   layer MUST process 28 MSBs of the d-ACH as the source of the
   sequencing information for the OAM packet.

4.  Use of Hybrid OAM in DetNet

   Hybrid OAM methods are used in performance monitoring and defined in
   [RFC7799] as:

      Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement that use a combination
      of Active Methods and Passive Methods.

   A hybrid measurement method may produce metrics as close to passive,
   but it still alters something in a data packet even if that is the
   value of a designated field in the packet encapsulation.  One example
   of such a hybrid measurement method is the Alternate Marking method
   described in [RFC8321].  Reserving the field for the Alternate
   Marking method in the DetNet Header will enhance available to an
   operator set of DetNet OAM tools.

5.  OAM Interworking Models

   Interworking of two OAM domains that utilize different networking
   technology can be realized either by a peering or a tunneling model.
   In a peering model, OAM domains are within the corresponding network
   domain.  When using the peering model, state changes that are
   detected by a Fault Management OAM protocol can be mapped from one
   OAM domain into another or a notification, e.g., an alarm, can be
   sent to a central controller.  In the tunneling model of OAM
   interworking, usually, only one active OAM protocol is used.  Its
   test packets are tunneled through another domain along with the data
   flow, thus ensuring the fate sharing among test and data packets.

5.1.  OAM of DetNet MPLS Interworking with OAM of TSN

   Active DetNet OAM is required to provide the E2E fault management and
   performance monitoring for a DetNet flow.  Interworking of DetNet
   active OAM with MPLS data plane with the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive
   Networking (TSN) domain based on [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-tsn].

   In the case of the peering model is used in the fault management OAM,
   then the node that borders both TSN and DetNet MPLS domains MUST
   support [RFC7023].  [RFC7023] specified the mapping of defect states
   between Ethernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet
   PWs that are part of an end-to-end (E2E) emulated Ethernet service.
   Requirements and mechanisms described in [RFC7023] are equally
   applicable to using the peering model to achieve E2E FM OAM over
   DetNet MPLS and TSN domains.  The Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
   protocol [IEEE.CFM] or in [ITU.Y1731] can provide fast detection of a
   failure in the TSN segment of the DetNet service.  In the DetNet MPLS
   domain BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection), specified in
   [RFC5880] and [RFC5885], can be used.  To provide E2E failure
   detection, the TSN segment might be presented as a concatenated with
   the DetNet MPLS and the Section 6.8.17 [RFC5880] MAY be used to
   inform the upstream DetNet MPLS node of a failure of the TSN segment.
   Performance monitoring can be supported by [RFC6374] in the DetNet
   MPLS and [ITU.Y1731] in the TSN domains, respectively.  Performance
   objectives for each domain should refer to metrics that additive or
   be defined for each domain separately.

   The following considerations are to be realized when using the
   tunneling model of OAM interworking between DetNet MPLS and TSN
   domains:

   *  Active OAM test packet MUST be mapped to the same TSN Stream ID as
      the monitored DetNet flow.

Internet-Draft          OAM for DetNet over MPLS              March 2021


   *  Active OAM test packets MUST be treated in the TSN domain based on
      its S-label and CoS marking (TC field value).

   Note that the tunneling model of the OAM interworking requires that
   the remote peer of the E2E OAM domain supports the active OAM
   protocol selected on the ingress endpoint.  For example, if BFD is
   used for proactive path continuity monitoring in the DetNet MPLS
   domain, a TSN endpoint of the DetNet service has also support BFD as
   defined in [RFC5885].

5.2.  OAM of DetNet MPLS Interworking with OAM of DetNet IP

   Interworking between active OAM segments in DetNet MPLS and DetNet IP
   domains can also be realized using either the peering or the
   tunneling model, as discussed in Section 5.1.  Using the same
   protocol, e.g., BFD, over both segments, simplifies the mapping of
   errors in the peering model.  To provide the performance monitoring
   over a DetNet IP domain STAMP [RFC8762] and its extensions
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] can be used.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any requests for IANA allocation.  This
   section can be deleted before the publication of the draft.

7.  Security Considerations

   Additionally, security considerations discussed in DetNet
   specifications: [RFC8655], [I-D.ietf-detnet-security],
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] are applicable to this document.  Security
   concerns and issues related to MPLS OAM tools like LSP Ping
   [RFC8029], BFD over PW [RFC5885] also apply to this specification.
