2.  Abstract

This memo defines a directory information profile for a white pages per-
son,  to  be  carried in an application/directory MIME Content-Type. The
profile consists of type definitions (e.g., for name and email  address)
and the corresponding format of values that each type is allowed to con-
tain.

3.  Overview

The application/directory MIME Content-Type  defined  in  [MIME-DIR]  is
used for representing directory information in MIME format. It defines a
general framework for carrying "type: value" style  information  in  the
body  of  a  MIME message, but does not define specific types or values.
This document defines a profile containing the types  and  corresponding
value formats for representing information about an Internet white pages
person. The profile reflects the Internet  white  pages  service  schema
defined in [DIR-WPP].

4.  The White Pages Person Profile

The profile is defined as follows, using the profile  registration  tem-
plate from Section 8 of [MIME-DIR].

4.1.  Person profile definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME profile wpperson

   Profile name: wpperson

   Profile purpose: to hold white pages information about a person

   Profile types: address, cn, sn, email, o, phone,  misc,  lastmoddate,
   lastmodby, lastmodtype, dataowner, datasource

plate from Section 9 of [MIME-DIR].

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type address

   Type name: address

   Type purpose: to hold postal address information

   Type encoding: a sequence of text lines separated by <CRLF> SPACE

   Type special notes: The usual  line-folding  technique  described  in
   [MIME-DIR]  can  be  used  to  represent  multi-line addresses (i.e.,
   applications should interpret folded address lines as separate  lines
   in a single address, not a continuation of one address line).

      If this type is to be used to hold  multiple  kinds  of  telephone
      numbers (e.g., fax and voice), it is advisable to distinguish them
      with some kind of descriptive comment in the value. For example:

   Subject: whatever

The next example illustrates the use of RFC  1522  encoding  to  include
non-ascii characters in some of the "person" profile types.

           profile="person";

6.  Security Considerations

Internet mail is subject to many well known security attacks,  including
monitoring,  replay,  and forgery. Applications should also take care to
display directory data in a "safe" environment (e.g.,  PostScript-valued
types).

10.  Appendix A - Correspondence With Various Directory Services

The scheme defined here is intended to be general enough  to  work  with
any  number  of  directory  services, including, but not limited to LDAP
[RFC-1777], WHOIS++ [RFC-1835], SOLO, and X.500 [x500].   This  appendix
provides  a mapping between attribute types or fields in these directory
services and the scheme defined here.
