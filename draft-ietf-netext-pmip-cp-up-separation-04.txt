       Separation of Control and User Plane for Proxy Mobile IPv6
             draft-ietf-netext-pmip-cp-up-separation-04.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies a method to split the Control Plane (CP) and
   User Plane (UP) for a Proxy Mobile IPv6 based network infrastructure.
   Existing specifications allow a mobile access gateway (MAG) to
   separate its control and user plane using the Alternate Care of
   address mobility option for IPv6, or Alternate IPv4 Care of Address
   option for IPv4.  However, the current specification does not provide
   any mechanism allowing the local mobility anchor (LMA) to perform an
   analogous functional split.  To remedy that shortcoming, this
   document specifies a mobility option enabling a LMA to provide an
   alternate LMA address to be used for the bi-directional user plane
   traffic between the MAG and LMA.  With this new option, a LMA will be
   able to use an IP address for its user plane which is different than
   the IP address used for the control plane.

1.  Introduction

   A PMIPv6 infrastructure comprises two primary entities: LMA (local
   mobility anchor) and MAG (mobile access gateway).  The interface
   between MAG and LMA consists of the control plane and user plane.
   The control plane is responsible for signaling messages between MAG
   and LMA such as the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) messages to establish a mobility binding.  In
   addition, the control plane components in the MAG and LMA are also
   responsible for setting up and tearing down a bi-directional tunnel
   between the MAG and LMA.  The user plane is used for carrying the
   mobile node's IP traffic between the MAG and the LMA over the bi-
   directional tunnel.

   Widely deployed mobility management systems for wireless
   communications require separation of IP transport for forwarding user

   plane and control plane traffic.  This separation offers more
   flexible deployment options for LMA and MAG entities in Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 as described in [I-D.wakikawa-req-mobile-cp-separation].  To
   meet this requirement, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) requires that the
   control plane functions of the LMA to be addressable at a different
   IP address than the IP address assigned for the user plane.  However,
   PMIPv6 does not currently specify a mechanism for allowing the LMA to
   separate the control plane from the user plane.  The LMA is currently
   required to associate the IP address of the tunnel source with the
   target IP address for the control messages received from the MAG.

   The control plane and user plane components (of the MAG and LMA) are
   typically co-located in the same physical entity.  However, there are
   situations where it is desirable to have the control and user plane
   of the MAG and LMA in separate physical entities.  For example, in a
   WLAN (Wireless LAN) network, it may be desirable to have the control
   plane component of the MAG reside on the Access Controller (also
   sometimes referred to as Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)) while the
   user plane component of the MAG resides on the WLAN Access Point.
   This enables all the control plane messages to the LMA to be
   centralized while the user plane would be distributed across the
   multiple Access Points.  Similarly there is a need for either the
   control plane and user plane component of the LMA to be separated
   according to different scaling requirements, or in other cases the
   need to centralize the control plane in one geographical location
   while distributing the user plane component across multiple
   locations.  For example, as illustrated in Figure 1, the LMA and MAG
   could have one control session established for PMIPv6 control
   signaling, while maintaining separate connectivity via GRE or IP-in-
   IP tunneling for forwarding user plane traffic.

   [RFC6463] and [RFC6275] enable separating the control and user plane
   in the MAG.  In particular, [RFC6463] defines the Alternate IPv4
   Proxy Care of Address Option, and [RFC6275] defines an Alternate Care
   of Address for IPv6 address.  The MAG may provide an Alternate Care
   of Address in the PBU, and if the LMA supports this option then a bi-
   directional tunnel is setup between the LMA address and the MAG's
   alternate Care of address.  However, these documents do not specify a
   corresponding option for the LMA to provide an alternate address to
   the MAG.

   This specification therefore defines a new mobility option that
   enables a local mobility anchor to provide an alternate LMA address
   to be used for the bidirectional tunnel between the MAG and LMA as
   shown in Figure 1.

   The LMA Control Plane and the LMA User Plane functions are typically
   deployed on the same IP node and in such scenario the interface
   between these functions is internal to the implementation.
   Deployments may also choose to deploy the LMA Control Plane and the
   LMA User Plane functions on seperate IP nodes.  In such deployment
   models, there needs to be a protocol interface between these two
   functions and which is outside the scope of this document.  Possible
   options for such interface include OpenFlow [OpenFlow-Spec-v1.4.0],
   FORCES [RFC5810], use of routing infrastructure
   [I-D.matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc] or vendor specific approaches.
   This specification does not mandate a specific protocol interface and
   views this interface as a generic interface relevant more broadly for
   many other protocol systems in addition to Proxy Mobile IPv6.

      as the Alternate Care of Address.

3.  Additional Fields in Conceptual Data Structures

   To support the capability specified in this document, the conceptual
   Binding Update List entry data structure maintained by the LMA and
   the MAG is extended with the following additional fields.

   o  The IP address of the LMA that carries user plane traffic.

   o  The IP address of the LMA that handles control plane traffic.

4.  LMA User Plane Address Mobility Option

   The LMA User Plane Address mobility option is a new mobility header
   option defined for use with PBU and PBA messages exchanged between
   the LMA and the MAG.  This option is used for notifying the MAG about
   the LMA's user plane IPv6 or IPv4 address.  There can be multiple
   instances of the LMA User Plane Address mobility option present in
   the message, one for IPv4 and the other for IPv6 transport.

   The LMA User Plane Address mobility option has an alignment
   requirement of 8n+2.  Its format is as shown in Figure 2:

   Type

      <IANA-1> To be assigned by IANA.

   Length

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length of the option in
      octets, excluding the type and length fields.

   Reserved

      This field is unused in this specification.  The value MUST be set
      to zero (0) by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   LMA User Plane Address

      Contains the 32-bit IPv4 address, or the 128-bit IPv6 of the LMA
      User plane.  When the LMA User Plane Address Mobility option is
      included in a PBU message, this field can be a zero length field,
      or it can have a value of ALL_ZERO, with all bits in the 32-bit
      IPv4 address, or the 128-bit IPv6 address set to zero.

   When including the LMA User Plane Address mobility option in the PBU,
   the MAG must apply the following rules:

   o  When using IPv4 transport for the user-plane, the IP address field
      in the option can be either a zero-length field, or a 4-octet
      field with ALL_ZERO value.

   o  When using IPv6 transport for the user-plane, the IP address field
      in the option can be either a zero-length field, or a 16-octet
      field with ALL_ZERO value.

   When the LMA includes the LMA User Plane Address mobility option in
   the PBA, the IP address field in the option MUST be set to the LMA's
   IPv4 or IPv6 address carrying user-plane traffic.

   o  When using IPv4 transport for the user-plane, the IP address field
      in the option must be the IPv4 address carrying user-plane
      traffic.

   o  When using IPv6 transport for the user-plane, the IP address field
      in the option must be the IPv6 address carrying user-plane
      traffic.

5.  Protocol Configuration Variable

   This specification defines the following configuration variable,
   which must be configurable (e.g., by the system management) on the
   LMA and MAG mobility entities.  The configured value for this
   protocol variable MUST survive server reboots and service restarts,
   and MUST be the same for every LMA and MAG in the network domain
   supporting PMIPv6.

   Domain-wide-LMA-UPA-Support

         This variable indicates whether or not all the mobility
         entities in the PMIPv6 domain support the LMA User Plane
         Address mobility option.

         When this variable on the MAG is set to zero (0), the MAG MUST
         indicate whether it supports this feature, by including the LMA
         User Plane Address mobility option in the PBU.  If the option
         is not present in the PBU, the LMA SHALL disable this feature
         for the mobility session corresponding to the PBU.

         Setting this variable to one (1) on the MAG indicates that
         there is domain-wide support for this feature and the MAG is
         not required to include the LMA User Plane Address mobility
         option in the PBA.  In this case, the MAG MAY choose not to
         include the LMA User Plane Address mobility option in the PBU.

         When this variable on the LMA is set to zero (0), the LMA MUST
         NOT include the LMA User Plane Address mobility option in the
         PBA, unless the MAG has indicated support for this feature by
         including the LMA User Plane Address mobility option in the PBU
         message.

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 CP-UP Split                  June 2014


         Setting this variable to one (1) on the LMA indicates that
         there is domain-wide support for this feature and the LMA
         SHOULD choose to include this LMA User Plane Address mobility
         option in the PBA even if the option is not present in the PBU
         message.

         On both the LMA and the MAG, the default value for this
         variable is zero (0).  This implies that the default behavior
         of a MAG is to include this option in the PBU and the default
         behavior of a LMA is to include this option in a PBA only if
         the option is present in the PBU.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new mobility header option,
      LMA User Plane Address mobility option.  The format of this option
      is described in Section 4.  The type value <IANA-1> for this
      mobility option is to be allocated from the Mobility Options
      registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters>.
      RFC Editor: Please replace <IANA-1> in Section 4 with the assigned
      value and update this section accordingly.

7.  Security Considerations

   The LMA User Plane Address mobility option defined in this
   specification is for use in PBU and PBA messages.  This option is
   carried like any other mobility header option as specified in
   [RFC5213].  Therefore, it inherits security guidelines from
   [RFC5213].

   The LMA-UPA address provided within the LMA User Plane Address
   mobility option MUST be a valid address under the administrative
   control associated with the LMA functional block.

   If the LMA-UP and the LMA-CP functions are hosted in different
   entities, any control messages between these two entities containing
   the LMA User Plane Address mobility option MUST be protected by
   IPsec.
