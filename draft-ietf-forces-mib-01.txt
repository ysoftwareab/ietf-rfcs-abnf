Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular, it defines a MIB for the Forwarding and Control Element
   Separation (ForCES) Network Element (NE).  The ForCES working group
   is defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control the
   behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE).

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                     April 2006


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The ForCES MIB is a primarily read-only MIB that captures information
   related to the ForCES protocol ([RFC3654] and [RFC3746]).  This
   includes state information about the associations between CE(s) and
   FE(s) in the NE.

   The ForCES MIB does not include information that is specified in
   other MIBs, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.

   More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB relative to
   associations includes:

   o  identifiers of the elements in the association,

   o  state of the association,

   o  configuration parameters of the association, and

   o  statistics of the association.


3.  Design of the ForCES MIB

   In an NE composed of one or more FEs and a single CE, the CE is
   clearly aware of all associations and hence can provide this
   information in a single ForCES MIB.  In contrast, in an NE composed
   of more than one CE, such association information is distributed and
   hence more than one ForCES MIB may be necessary, unless this
   information is aggregated into a single ForCES MIB by some means
   beyond the scope of this document.  Nevertheless, the ForCES MIB
   design is compatible with both the single-CE and the multiple-CE
   case.


4.  Association State

   Association state as shown in the MIB is considered from the CE's
   point of view:

   o  An association is in the DOWN state if the CE has not received any
      message (heartbeat or other protocol message) from the FE within a
      given time period or if an Association Teardown message has been
      sent by the CE.

   o  An association is in the ESTABLISHING state as long as no message
      has been received from the FE after the CE has sent a positive
      Association Setup Response message.

   o  An association is in the UP state in all other cases.

   Note that it is left to the implementers to choose how long entries
   of associations in the DOWN state remain in the MIB until they are
   removed, if at all.


5.  ForCES MIB Definition

   For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the
   following information is provided by the MIB:

   o  Current state of the association:

      *  DOWN: the CE(s) indicated by the CE ID and FE(s) indicated by
         the FE ID are not associated.

      *  ESTABLISHING: transient state until the association has been
         established.  See Section 4 above for details.

      *  UP: the CE(s) indicated by the CE ID and FE(s) indicated by the
         FE ID are associated.

   o  Time when the association attained the UP state.

   o  Time when the association appeared in the MIB.

   o  Number of transitions to ESTABLISHING state since the association
      appeared in the MIB.

   o  Number of transitions to UP state since the association appeared
      in the MIB.

   o  Number of ForCES messages sent/received since the association
      attained the UP state.

6.  Security Considerations

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to assign a number to this MIB.
