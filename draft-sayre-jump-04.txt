1.  Introduction

   JSON [7] provides an interoperable object serialization format
   capable of representing numbers, strings, arrays, and a wide range of
   Unicode characters.  This specification defines a loosely-coupled
   protocol based on a small set of conventions for JSON records and a
   profile of HTTP.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [8].

3.  JUMP Records

   An example JUMP record:
   {
    "title": "Example",
     "text": "Text and <a href='http://example.com/'>link</a>.",
     "link": "http://example.com/my.html",
    "media": "http://example.com/my.jpg",
       "id": ["B1549145-55CB-4A6B-9526-70D370821BB5"],
     "type": ["object"],
     "sync": "88C3865F-05A6-4E5C-8867-0FAC9AE264FC",
     "tags": ["foo","bar"],
     "self": "http://example.com/42.jump",
     "edit": "http://example.com/edit.cgi/42"
   }

   Detailed field definitions can be found in Section 3.1.

   No JUMP field is required for every record, but interoperability will
   increase as the number of standard fields increases.  Thus, a record
   containing zero standard fields is very unlikely to interoperate with
   any given JUMP implementation.  Records without 'title' or 'text'
   fields are also unlikely to interoperate with an independently-
   developed JUMP implementation.  Guidelines for extension fields are
   detailed in Section 3.2.

3.1.  Standard Fields

3.1.1.  The 'type' Field

   The 'type' field denotes the type its containing object.  JUMP
   records have a default type of "object".
     "type": "object"

   Annotated JUMP arrays (Section 4.1) MUST contain the value "array".
     "type": "array"

   The 'type' field can have an array as its value, in which case the
   containing object is considered to be the union of its values.  For
   example, the following example shows a type field that contains the
   "array" value required by JUMP arrays:
     "type": ["array", "quux-extendo"]

   JUMP records and fields SHOULD contain general type values whenever
   possible, so that independent implementations can interoperate to
   some degree.  Additionaly, type names should be suitable for use as a
   MIME parameter value.

3.1.2.  Text Fields

   Text fields are based on the Text Constructs found in RFC 4287,
   section 3.1 [9].  Text fields are to be interpreted as HTML.

   'title'  A text field containing the title of the record.

   'text'  A text field containing the content or description of the
      record.

3.1.3.  Other Fields

   @tbd.  Not hard to predict.  Borrow from email and Atom as needed.

   'author'  If 'author' has a simple value, its value is taken to be
      the equivalent of the 'name' element specified in the Atom
      Syndication Format [9].  If its value is an object, the 'value'
      field corresponds to the author 'name'. 'email' and 'uri' are as
      specified in the Atom Syndication Format [9].  If the value is an
      array, there are multiple authors.

   'contributor'  As specified for author, with a different field name.

   'edit'  A URI [5] or IRI [6] used to edit the record.  See Section 5
      for a description of JUMP's HTTP-based editing protocol.

   'id'  One or more permanent identifiers associated with the record.

   'lang'  The natural language of the JSON record and its descendents.
      If the value of 'lang' is an object, it may itself contain a
      dictionary mapping keys to languages.  The 'default' value covers
      any key not explicitly mentioned.

   'link'  A URI [5] or IRI [6] used to view the record in a Web
      browser.

   'media'  The URI [5] or IRI [6] of a media object associated with the
      record.

   'published'  A string (or object with string value) containing a
      timestamp formatted as an Atom Syndication Format date [9].

   'self'  A URI [5] or IRI [6] where a read-only version of the record
      is present.

Internet-Draft                    JUMP                      January 2007


   'sync'  A string (or object with string value) containing a token for
      clients to use when identifing versions of a record, as with the
      HTTP Etag header [10].

   'updated'  A string (or object with string value) containing a
      timestamp formatted as an Atom Syndication Format date [9].
      Values corresponding to the record's HTTP Last-Modified date are
      acceptable here.

   'tags'  An array of strings or objects (with string values)
      indicating labels that have been assigned to the record.

3.2.  Extension Fields

   }
   ]

4.1.  Annotated Arrays

   JUMP arrays can be annotated by using an extra level of indirection.

   {

   "title": "Example Annotated Array",
    "text": "This is <a href='./foo'>html</a> by default.",
   "quux-x": "some special extensions property",
   "value": [
     {
       "title": "Example",
        "text": "Text and <a href='http://example.com/'>link</a>.",
        "link": "http://example.com/my.html",
       "media": "http://example.com/my.jpg",
          "id": ["B1549145-55CB-4A6B-9526-70D370821BB5"],
        "type": ["object"],
        "sync": "88C3865F-05A6-4E5C-8867-0FAC9AE264FC",
        "tags": ["foo","bar"],
        "edit": "http://example.com/edit.cgi/42"
     },
     {
       "title": "Example 2",
        "text": "Text and <a href='http://example.com/'>link</a>.",
        "link": "http://example.com/my2.html",
       "media": "http://example.com/my2.jpg",
          "id": ["8B6373C7-DA75-4120-A9BE-30C4CDA3CB73"],
        "type": ["object"],
        "sync": "BC4DEFA3-BF50-428B-8606-B3230953642A",
        "tags": ["foo","bar"],
        "edit": "http://example.com/edit.cgi/43"
     }
    ]
   }

4.2.  Nesting

   JUMP records and arrays can be nested.  In the following example, an
   annotated array contains 3 elements, the second of which is an array
   itself.
   {
    "type": ["array", "quux-extendo"],
   "title": "Example Annotated Array",
    "text": "This is <a href='./foo'>html</a> by default.",
   "quux-x": "some special extensions property",
   "value": [
     {
       "title": "Example",
        "text": "Text and <a href='http://example.com/'>link</a>.",
        "link": "http://example.com/my.html",
       "media": "http://example.com/my.jpg",
          "id": ["B1549145-55CB-4A6B-9526-70D370821BB5"],

5.  Editing

   JUMP records are edited using HTTP methods, like all HTTP resources.

5.1.  Editing Single Records

   @tbd.

5.2.  Editing Individual JSON Fields

   It is sometimes desirable to edit a single JSON field, rather than
   replace the whole record.  For example, given a record at the URI
   http://example.com/foo, it should be possible to edit or add a single
   field.
   {
    "title": "Example 3",
     "text": "Text and <a href='http://example.com/'>link</a>.",
     "link": "http://example.com/my3.html"
   }

   To edit a field, the client uses the familiar slash syntax of URIs to
   denote the object hierarchy. (note: may change this, or make it
   configurable, but the general idea works...)
   PUT /foo/title HTTP/1.1
               Host: example.com
               Content-Type: application/json
               Content-Length: 34

               "Example 3: This is the new title"

   A successful request would result in the following JUMP record:
   {
    "title": "Example 3: This is the new title",
     "text": "Text and <a href='http://example.com/'>link</a>.",
     "link": "http://example.com/my3.html"
   }

   The 'edit' field discussed in Section 3.1.3 provides a useful way
   compute URIs for the client, sparing them complex path calculations.
   (todo: example using 'edit' instead of picking out an array slice).

5.3.  Editing Arrays

   @tbd.

6.  Common JUMP Record Types

6.1.  jsCalendar

   jsCalendar is a JSON formulation of hCalendar [1], which is based on
   iCalendar [4].
   {
              "type": ["vevent"],
          "category": [],
             "class": "PUBLIC",
       "description": "A synonym for the 'text' field defined above.",
      "dtstart-text": "A Human readable description of the start date",
           "dtstart": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ",
        "dtend-text": "A Human readable description of the end date",
             "dtend": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ",
          "duration": "",
          "location": "In a van, down by the river.",
            "status": "TENTATIVE",
           "summary": "A synonym for the 'title' field defined above.",
               "uid": "04C0CFFF-10C6-4366-A08D-114D9391D22F",
               "url": "http://example.com",
     "last-modified": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ"
   }

6.2.  jsCard

   jsCard is a JSON formulation of hCard [2], which is based on vCard
   [3].  The TITLE property from both hCard and vCard is "vtitle" in
   jsCard.
 {
           "type": ["vcard"],
             "fn": "",
              "n": {

           "additional-name": "",
          "honorific-prefix": "",
          "honorific-suffix": ""
                   },
       "nickname": "",
    "sort-string": "",

8.  IANA Considerations

   JUMP records can be identified with one of two media types,
   'application/jump' and 'application/jumparray'.

8.1.  application/jump

   MIME media type name:  application

   MIME subtype name:  jump

   Mandatory parameters:  None.

   Optional parameters:

      "types":  This parameter contains some or all of the type
         information from the internal JUMP records.

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/json" as
      described in RFC4627 [7], Section 6.

   Security considerations:  As defined in this specification.

   Interoperability considerations:  n/a.

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  No known applications
      currently use this media type.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s):  n/a

   File extension:  .jump

   Macintosh File Type code:  TEXT

   Person and email address to contact for further information:  Robert
      Sayre

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Author/Change controller:  Robert Sayre
