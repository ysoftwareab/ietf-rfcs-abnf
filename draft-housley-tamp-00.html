<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
        This document describes a transport independent, request-response protocol for the management of trust anchors and community identifiers stored in a device.  The protocol makes use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), and a digital signature is used to provide integrity protection and data origin authentication.  Each trust anchor is associated with a list of functions within devices that make use of digital signature mechanisms.  Digital signatures can be validated directly with the public key associated with the trust anchor, or they can be validated with a certified public key whose X.509 certification path terminates with the trust anchor public key.

Introduction</h3>

<p>This document describes the Trust Anchor Management Protocol (TAMP).  TAMP may be used to manage the trust anchors and community identifiers in any device that uses digital signatures; however, this specification was written with the requirements of cryptographic modules in mind.  For example, TAMP can support signed firmware packages, where the trust anchor public key can be used to validate digital signatures on firmware packages or validate the X.509 certification path <a class='info' href='#RFC3280'>[RFC3280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., Polk, W., Ford, W., and D. Solo, &ldquo;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a><a class='info' href='#X.509'>[X.509]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;ITU-T Recommendation X.509 -             The Directory - Authentication Framework,&rdquo; 2000.</span><span>)</span></a> of the firmware package signer <a class='info' href='#RFC4108'>[RFC4108]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., &ldquo;Using Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) to Protect Firmware Packages,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Most TAMP messages are digitally signed to provide integrity protection and data origin authentication.  Both signed and unsigned TAMP messages employ the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <a class='info' href='#RFC3852'>[RFC3852]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>This specification does not provide for confidentiality of TAMP messages.  If confidentiality is required, then the communications environment that is used to transfer TAMP messages must provide it.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Trust Anchors</h3>

<p>TAMP manages trust anchors, but TAMP does not dictate a particular structure for the storage of trust anchor information in cryptographic modules.  A trust anchor contains a public key that is used to validate digital signatures.
</p>
<p>There are three types of trust anchors: apex trust anchors, management trust anchors, and identity trust anchors.
</p>
<p>All trust anchors, regardless of their type, are named by the public key, and all trust anchors consist of the following components:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A public key signature algorithm identifier and associated public key, which MAY include parameters
</li>
<li>A public key identifier
</li>
<li>An OPTIONAL human readable trust anchor title
</li>
<li>OPTIONAL X.509 certification path controls
</li>
</ul><p>
          
</p>
<p>The apex trust anchor and management trust anchors that issue TAMP messages also include a sequence number for replay detection.
</p>
<p>The public key is used to name a trust anchor, and the public key identifier is used to identify the trust anchor as the signer.  This public key identifier can be stored with the trust anchor, or in most public key identifier assignment methods, it can be computed from the public key whenever needed.  The trust anchor X.500 distinguished name within the OPTIONAL X.509 certification path controls is used when the trust anchor public key is used to validate an X.509 certification path.  In this case, the certificate subject is the signer.  Use of an X.509 certification path represents delegation, and delegation is possible only when the trust anchor configuration includes an X.500 distinguished name.
</p>
<p>A trust anchor public key can be used in two different ways to support digital signature validation.  In the first approach, the trust anchor public key is used directly to validate the digital signature.  In the second approach, the trust anchor public key is used to validate an X.509 certification path, and then the subject public key in the final certificate in the certification path is used to validate the digital signature.  When the second approach is employed, the certified public key can be used for things other than digital signature validation; the other possible actions are constrained by the key usage certificate extension.  Cryptographic modules MUST support validation of X.509 certificates that are directly signed by a trust anchor; however, support for longer certification paths is RECOMMENDED.  The CMS provides a location to carry X.509 certificates, and this facility can be used to transfer certificates to aid in the construction of the certification path.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2.1"></a><h3>1.2.1.&nbsp;
Apex Trust Anchors</h3>

<p>Within the context of a single cryptographic module, one trust anchor is superior to all others.  This trust anchor is referred to as the apex trust anchor.  This trust anchor represents the ultimate authority over the cryptographic module.  The ultimate authority could be the legal owner of the device in a commercial setting.  Much of this authority can be delegated to other trust anchors.
</p>
<p>The apex trust anchor private key is expected to be controlled by an entity with information assurance responsibility for the cryptographic module.  The apex trust anchor is by definition unconstrained and therefore does not have explicit authorization information associated with it.  In order to make processing of messages as uniform as possible, the apex has an implicit OID associated with it that represents the special anyContentType value.  This OID will be used as input to processing algorithms to represent the apex trust anchor authorization.
</p>
<p>Due to the special nature of the apex trust anchor, TAMP includes separate facilities to change it.  In particular, TAMP includes a facility to securely replace the apex trust anchor.  This action might be taken for one or more of the following reasons:
</p>
<p>
            </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The crypto period for the apex trust anchor public/private key pair has come to an end
</li>
<li>The apex trust anchor private key is no longer available
</li>
<li>The apex trust anchor public/private key pair needs to be revoked
</li>
<li>The authority has decided to use a different digital signature algorithm or the same digital signature algorithm with different parameters, such as a different elliptic curve
</li>
<li>The authority has decided to use a different key size
</li>
<li>The authority has decided to transfer control to another authority
</li>
</ul><p>
          
</p>
<p>To accommodate these requirements, the apex trust anchor has a different structure than other trust anchors; it includes two public keys.  Whenever the apex trust anchor is updated, both public keys are replaced.  The first public key, called the operational public key, is used in the same manner as other trust anchors.  Any type of TAMP message, including an Apex Trust Anchor Update message, can be validated with the operational public key.  The second public key, called the contingency public key, can only be used to update the apex trust anchor.  The contingency private key SHOULD be used at only one point in time; it is used only to sign an Apex Trust Anchor Update message which results in its own replacement (as well as the replacement of the operational public key).  The contingency public key is distributed in encrypted form.  When the contingency public key is used to validate an Apex Trust Anchor Update message, the symmetric key needed to decrypt the contingency public key is provided as part of the signed Apex Trust Anchor Update message that is to be verified with the contingency public key.

Management Trust Anchors</h3>

<p>Management trust anchors are used in the management of cryptographic modules.  For example, the TAMP messages specified in this document are validated to a management trust anchor.  Likewise, a signed firmware package as specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC4108'>[RFC4108]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., &ldquo;Using Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) to Protect Firmware Packages,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> is validated to a management trust anchor.
</p>
<p>Authorization checking is needed for management messages, and these checks are based on the content type of the management message.  As a result, management trust anchors include a list of object identifiers (OIDs) that name authorized content types along with OPTIONAL constraints.

Architectural Elements</h3>

<p>TAMP does not assume any particular architecture; however, for TAMP to be useful in an architecture, it MUST include a cryptographic module, TAMP protocol processing, and other application-specific protocol processing.
</p>
<p>A globally unique algorithm identifier MUST be assigned for each one-way hash function, digital signature generation/validation algorithm, and symmetric key unwrapping algorithm that is implemented.  To support CMS, an object identifier (OID) is assigned to name a one-way hash function, and another OID is assigned to name each combination of a one-way hash function when used with a digital signature algorithm.  Similarly, certificates associate OIDs assigned to public key algorithms with subject public keys, and certificates make use of an OID that names both the one-way hash function and the digital signature algorithm for the certificate issuer digital signature.

Cryptographic Message Syntax Profile</h3>

<p>TAMP makes use of signed and unsigned messages.  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is used in both cases.  A digital signature is used to protect the message from undetected modification and provide data origin authentication.  TAMP makes no general provision for encryption of content.
</p>
<p>CMS is used to construct a signed TAMP message.  The CMS ContentInfo content type MUST always be present, and it MUST encapsulate the CMS SignedData content type.  The CMS SignedData content type MUST encapsulate the TAMP message.  A unique content type identifier identifies the particular TAMP message.  The CMS encapsulation of a signed TAMP message is summarized by:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

 ContentInfo {
   contentType id-signedData, -- (1.2.840.113549.1.7.2)

   digestAlgorithms  DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers, -- Only one
   encapContentInfo  EncapsulatedContentInfo,
   certificates      CertificateSet, -- OPTIONAL signer certificates
   crls              CertificateRevocationLists, -- OPTIONAL

 EncapsulatedContentInfo {
   eContentType  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, -- Names TAMP message type
   eContent      OCTET STRING       -- Contains TAMP message
 }

</pre></div>
<p>When a TAMP message is used to update the apex trust anchor, this same structure is used; however, the digital signature will be validated with either the apex trust anchor operational public key or the contingency public key.  When the contingency public key is used, the symmetric key needed to decrypt the previously stored contingency public key is provided as a contingency-public-key-decrypt-key unsigned attribute.  Section 4.5 of this document describes the Apex Trust Anchor Update message.
</p>
<p>CMS is also used to construct an unsigned TAMP message.  The CMS ContentInfo structure MUST always be present, and it MUST be the outermost layer of encapsulation.  A unique content type identifier identifies the particular TAMP message.  The CMS encapsulation of an unsigned TAMP message is summarized by:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

<p>Each of the attributes used with this CMS profile has a single attribute value.  Even though the syntax is defined as a SET OF AttributeValue, there MUST be exactly one instance of AttributeValue present.
</p>
<p>The SignedAttributes syntax within signerInfo is defined as a SET OF Attribute.  The SignedAttributes MUST include only one instance of any particular attribute.  TAMP messages that violate this rule MUST be rejected as malformed.
</p>
<p>The TAMP message originator MUST include the content-type and message-digest attributes.  The TAMP message originator MAY also include the binary-signing-time signed attribute.
</p>
<p>The TAMP message originator MAY include any other attribute that it deems appropriate.  The intent is to allow additional signed attributes to be included if a future need is identified.  This does not cause an interoperability concern because unrecognized signed attributes MUST be ignored.

Content-Hints Attribute</h3>

<p>Many applications find it useful to have information that describes the innermost content when multiple layers of encapsulation have been applied.  Since this version of TAMP only has one layer of encapsulation, the encapContentInfo provides the content type of the innermost content.  To accommodate future versions of TAMP that might include additional layers of encapsulation, the content-hints attribute MUST be included in every instance of SignedData that does not directly encapsulate a TAMP message.  Section 2.9 of <a class='info' href='#RFC2634'>[RFC2634]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hoffman, P., &ldquo;Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> defines the content-hints attribute.
</p>
<p>The content-hints attribute contains two fields: contentDescription and contentType.  The contentType field MUST be present, and the contentDescription field MAY be present.  The fields of the content-hints attribute are used as follows:
</p>
<p>
              </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>contentDescription is OPTIONAL.  The TAMP message signer MAY provide a brief description of the purpose of the TAMP message.  The text is intended for human consumption, not machine processing.

An unsigned attribute is present only in Apex Trust Anchor Update messages that are to be validated by the apex trust anchor contingency public key.  In this case, the symmetric key to decrypt the previous contingency public key is provided in the contingency-public-key-decrypt-key unsigned attribute.

Trust Anchor Management Protocol Messages</h3>

<p>TAMP makes use of signed and unsigned messages.  The CMS is used in both cases.  An object identifier is assigned to each TAMP message type, and this object identifier is used as a content type in the CMS.
</p>
<p>TAMP specifies eleven message types.  The following provides the content type identifier for each TAMP message type, and it indicates whether a digital signature is REQUIRED.  If the following indicates that the TAMP message MUST be signed, then implementations MUST reject a message of that type that is not signed.
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The TAMP Status Query message MUST be signed.  It uses the following object identifier: { id-tamp 1 }.
</li>
<li>The TAMP Status Response message SHOULD be signed. It uses the following object identifier: { id-tamp 2 }.
</li>
<li>The Trust Anchor Update message MUST be signed.  It uses the following object identifier: { id-tamp 3 }.

TAMP Status Query</h3>

<p>The TAMP Status Query message is used to request information about the trust anchors that are currently installed in a cryptographic module, and for the list of communities to which the cryptographic module belongs.  The TAMP Status Query message MUST be signed.  For the query message to be valid, the cryptographic module MUST be an intended recipient of the query, the sequence number checking described in Section 6 MUST be successful when the TAMP message source is a trust anchor, and the digital signature MUST be validated by the apex trust anchor operational public key, a management trust anchor authorized for the id-ct-TAMP-statusQuery content type, or via a valid X.509 certification path originating with such a trust anchor.
</p>
<p>If the digital signature on the TAMP Status Query message is valid, sequence number checking is successful, the signer is authorized for the id-ct-TAMP-statusQuery content type, and the cryptographic module is an intended recipient of the TAMP message, then a TAMP Status Response message MUST be returned.  If a TAMP Status Response message is not returned, then a TAMP Error message MUST be returned.

To identify a cryptographic module, a combination of a cryptographic type and serial number are used.  The cryptographic type is represented as an ASN.1 object identifier, and the unique serial number is represented as a string of octets.  To facilitate compact representation of serial numbers, a contiguous block can be specified by the lowest included serial number and the highest included serial number.  When present, the high and low octet strings MUST have the same length.  The HardwareModuleIdentifiers sequence MUST NOT contain duplicate hwType values, so that each member of the sequence names all of the cryptographic modules of this type.  Object identifiers are also used to identify communities of cryptographic modules.  A sequence of these object identifiers is used if more than one community is the target of the message.  A cryptographic module is considered a target if it is a member of any of the listed communities.  An explicit NULL value is used to identify all modules that consider the signer of the TAMP message to be an authorized source for that message type.

The Trust Anchor Update message MUST be signed.  For a Trust Anchor Update message to be valid, the cryptographic module MUST be an intended receipient of the update, the sequence number checking described in Section 6 MUST be successful when the TAMP message source is a trust anchor, and the digital signature MUST be validated using the apex trust anchor operational public key, a management trust anchor authorized for the id-ct-TAMP-update content type, or via an authorized X.509 certification path originating with such a trust anchor.

Each entry in the sequence represents one of these actions, and is indicated by an instance of TrustAnchorUpdate.  The actions are a batch of updates that MUST be processed in the order that they appear, but each of the updates is processed independently.

These updates MUST NOT make any changes to the apex trust anchor.

</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>The TrustAnchorUpdate is a choice of three structures, and each alternative represents one of the three possible actions: add, remove, and change.  A description of the syntax associated with each of these actions follows:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>add is used to insert a new management or identity trust anchor into the cryptographic module.  The TrustAnchorInfo structure is used to provide the trusted public key and all of the information associated with it.  However, the action MUST fail if the subordination checks described in Section 7 are not satisfied.  See Section 3 for a discussion of the TrustAnchorInfo structure.  The apex trust anchor cannot be introduced into a cryptographic module using this action; therefore taType MUST NOT use ApexTrustAnchorInfo.  The privileges of the existing trust anchors are unchanged by this action.  An attempt to add a management or identity trust anchor that is already in place with the same values for every field in the TrustAnchorInfo structure, except the seqNum field, MUST be treated as a successful addition.  When the seqNum field does not match the most recently stored sequence number, the larger value MUST be stored by the cryptographic module.  An attempt to add a management or identity trust anchor that is already present with the same keyId and pubKey values, but with different values for any of the fields in the TrustAnchorInfo structure other than the seqNum field, MUST result in an error.
</li>
<li>remove is used to delete an existing management or identity trust anchor from the cryptographic module, including the deletion of the management trust anchor associated with the TAMP message signer.  However, the action MUST fail if the subordination checks described in Section 7 are not satisfied.  The public key contained in PublicKeyInfo names the management or identity trust anchor to be deleted.  An attempt to delete a trust anchor that is not present MUST be treated as a successful deletion.  The privileges of the deleted trust anchor are not distributed to other trust anchors in any manner.  The apex trust anchor cannot be removed using this action, which ensures that this action cannot place the cryptographic module in an unrecoverable configuration.
</li>
<li>change is used to update the information associated with an existing management or identity trust anchor in the cryptographic module.  The public key contained in the PublicKeyInfo field of TrustAnchorChangeInfo names the to-be-updated trust anchor.  However, the action MUST fail if the subordination checks described in Section 7 are not satisfied.  An attempt to change a trust anchor that is not present MUST result in a failure with the trustAnchorNotFound status code.  The TrustAnchorChangeInfo structure is used to provide the revised configuration of the management or identity trust anchor.  If the update fails for any reason, then the original trust anchor configuration MUST be preserved.  The apex trust anchor information cannot be changed using this action.
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>The fields of TrustAnchorChangeInfo are used as follows:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>pubKey contains the algorithm identifier and the public key of the management or identity trust anchor.  It is used to locate the to-be-updated trust anchor in the cryptographic module storage.
</li>
<li>keyId is OPTIONAL, and when present, it contains the public key identifier of the trust anchor public key.  If this field is not present, then the public key identifier remains unchanged.  If this field is present, the provided public key identifier replaces the previous one.
</li>
<li>mgmtTAType is OPTIONAL, and when present, it carries information specific to the management trust anchor using the MgmtTrustAnchorInfo structure.  This structure can be used to convert an identity trust anchor to a management trust anchor.  There is not a way to use a single Trust Anchor Update message to convert a management trust anchor to an identity trust anchor.  If this structure is not present, then the previous taType is preserved.  The syntax and semantics of MgmtTrustAnchorInfo is discussed in Section 3.  Each of the updates MUST satisfy the subordination checks described in Section 7.  Normally, the sequence number for the management trust anchor is updated by receiving a signed TAMP message, including the Sequence Number Adjust message.  The seqNum field is an alternative mechanism for advancing the sequence number values stored in a cryptographic module.  When this integer value is present, the provided value is stored if it is greater than the currently stored value.  When this integer value is not present, the previous value is preserved.
</li>
<li>taTitle is OPTIONAL, and when present, it provides a human readable name for the management or identity trust anchor.  When absent in a change trust anchor update, any title that was previously associated with the trust anchor is removed.  Similarly, when present in a change trust anchor update, the title in the message is associated with the trust anchor.  If a previous title was associated with the trust anchor, then the title is replaced.  If a title was not previously associated with the trust anchor, then the title from the update message is added.
</li>
<li>certPath is OPTIONAL, and when present, it provides the controls needed to construct and validate an X.509 certification path.  When absent in a change trust anchor update, any controls that were previously associated with the management or identity trust anchor are removed, which means that delegation is no longer permitted.  Similarly, when present in a change trust anchor update, the controls in the message are associated with the management or identity trust anchor.  If previous controls, including the trust anchor distinguished name, were associated with the trust anchor, then the controls are replaced, which means that delegation continues to be supported, but that different certification paths will be valid.  If controls were not previously associated with the management or identity trust anchor, then the controls from the update message are added, which enables delegation.  The syntax and semantics of CertPathControls is discussed in Section 3.

Apex Trust Anchor Update</h3>

<p>The Apex Trust Anchor Update message replaces both the operational and the contingency public keys associated with the apex trust anchor.  Each cryptographic module has exactly one apex trust anchor.  Since the apex trust anchor represents the ultimate authority over the cryptographic module, no constraints are associated with the apex trust anchor.  The public key identifier of the operational public key is used to identify the apex trust anchor in subsequent TAMP messages.  The digital signature on the Apex Trust Anchor Update message is validated with either the current operational public key or the current contingency public key.  For the Apex Trust Anchor Update message that is validated with the operational public key to be valid, the cryptographic module MUST be a target of the update, the sequence number MUST be larger than the most recently stored sequence number for the operational public key, and the digital signature MUST be validated directly with the operational public key.  That is, no delegation via a certification path is permitted.  For the Apex Trust Anchor Update message that is validated with the contingency public key to be valid, the cryptographic module MUST be a target of the update, the provided decryption key MUST properly decrypt the contingency public key, and the digital signature MUST be validated directly with the decrypted contingency public key.  Again, no delegation via a certification path is permitted.
</p>
<p>
          If the Apex Trust Anchor Update message is validated using the operational public key, then sequence number processing is handled normally, as described in Section 6.  If the Apex Trust Anchor Update message is validated using the contingency public key, then the TAMPMsgRef sequence number MUST contain a zero value.  A sequence number for subsequent messages that will be validated with the new operational public key can optionally be provided.  If no value is provided, then the cryptographic module MUST be prepared to accept any sequence number in the next TAMP message validated with the newly-installed apex trust anchor operational public key.
          If the Apex Trust Anchor Update message is valid and the clearTrustAnchors flag is set to TRUE, then all of the management and identity trust anchors stored in the cryptographic module MUST be deleted.  That is, the new apex trust anchor MUST be the only trust anchor remaining in the cryptographic module.  If the Apex Trust Anchor Update message is valid and the clearCommunities flag is set to TRUE, then all community identifiers stored in the cryptographic module MUST be deleted.
        
</p>
<p>The SignedData structure includes a sid value, and it identifies the apex trust anchor public key that will be used to validate the digital signature on this TAMP message.  The public key identifier for the operational public key is known in advance, and it is stored as part of the apex trust anchor.  The public key identifier for the contingency public key is not known in advance; however, the presence of the unsigned attribute containing the symmetric key needed to decrypt the contingency public key unambiguously indicates that the TAMP message signer used the contingency private key to sign the Apex Trust Anchor Update message.
</p>
<p>If the digital signature on the Apex Trust Anchor Update message is valid using either the apex trust anchor operational public key or the apex trust anchor contingency public key, sequence number checking is successful, and the cryptographic module is an intended recipient of the TAMP message, then the cryptographic module MUST update the apex trust anchor and return an Apex Trust Anchor Update Confirm message.  If an Apex Trust Anchor Update Confirm message is not returned, then a TAMP Error message MUST be returned.  Note that the sequence number MUST be zero if the Apex Trust Anchor Update message is validated with the apex trust anchor contingency public key.

<p>The cryptographic module maintains a list of identifiers for the communities of which it is a member.  The Community Update message can be used to remove or add community identifiers from this list.  The Community Update message MUST be signed.  For the Community Update message to be valid, the cryptographic module MUST be a target of the update, the sequence number checking described in Section 6 MUST be successful when the TAMP message source is a trust anchor, and the digital signature MUST be validated by the apex trust anchor operational public key, a management trust anchor authorized for the id-ct-TAMP-communityUpdate content type, or via an X.509 certification path originating with such a trust anchor.

<p>If the cryptographic module supports the Community Update message, the digital signature on the Community Update message is valid, sequence number checking is successful, the signer is authorized for the id-ct-TAMP-communityUpdate content type, and the cryptographic module is an intended recipient of the TAMP message, then the cryptographic module MUST make the specified updates and return a Community Update Confirm message.

<li>badSignedData is used to indicate that the SignedData syntax is invalid, the version is unknown or unsupported, or more than one entry is present in digestAlgorithms.
</li>
<li>badEncapContent is used to indicate that the EncapsulatedContentInfo syntax is invalid.  This error can be generated due to problems located in SignedData.
</li>
<li>badCertificate is used to indicate that the syntax for one or more certificates in CertificateSet is invalid.
</li>
<li>badSignerInfo is used to indicate that the SignerInfo syntax is invalid, or the version is unknown or unsupported.
</li>
<li>badSignedAttrs is used to indicate that the signedAttrs syntax within SignerInfo is invalid.
</li>
<li>badUnsignedAttrs is used to indicate that the unsignedAttrs within SignerInfo contains an attribute other than the contingency-public-key-decrypt-key unsigned attribute, which is the only unsigned attribute supported by this specification.
</li>
<li>missingContent is used to indicate that the OPTIONAL eContent is missing in EncapsulatedContentInfo, which is REQUIRED in this specification.  This error can be generated due to problems located in SignedData.
</li>
<li>noTrustAnchor is used to indicate one of two possible error situations.  In one case, the subjectKeyIdentifier does not identify the public key of a trust anchor or a certification path that terminates with an installed trust anchor.  In the other case, the issuerAndSerialNumber is used to identify the TAMP message signer, which is prohibited by this specification.
</li>
<li>notAuthorized is used to indicate one of two possible error situations.  In one case the sid within SignerInfo leads to an installed trust anchor, but that trust anchor is not an authorized signer for the received TAMP message content type.  Identity trust anchors are not authorized signers for any of the TAMP message content types.  In the other case, the signer of a Trust Anchor Update message is not authorized to manage the to-be-updated trust anchor as determined by a failure of the subordination processing in Sec. 7.

            badDigestAlgorithm is used to indicate that the digestAlgorithm in either SignerInfo or SignedData is unknown or unsupported.
          
</li>
<li>badSignatureAlgorithm is used to indicate that the signatureAlgorithm in SignerInfo is unknown or unsupported.
</li>
<li>unsupportedKeySize is used to indicate that the signatureAlgorithm in SignerInfo is known and supported, but the TAMP message digital signature could not be validated because an unsupported key size was employed by the signer.

<li>insufficientMemory indicates that the update could not be processed because the cryptographic module did not have sufficient memory to store the resulting trust anchor configuration or community identifier.
</li>
<li>unsupportedTAMPMsgType indicates that the TAMP message could not be processed because the cryptographic module does not support the provided TAMP message type.  This code will be used if the id-ct-TAMP-communityUpdate content type is provided and the cryptographic module does not support the Community Update message.  This status code will also be used if the contentType value within eContentType is not one that is defined in this specification.
</li>
<li>apexTAMPAnchor indicates that the update could not be processed because the Trust Anchor Update message tried to remove the apex trust anchor.
</li>
<li>improperTAAddition indicates that a trust anchor update is trying to add a new trust anchor that may already exist, but some attributes of the to-be-added trust anchor are being modified in an improper manner.  The desired trust anchor configuration may be attainable with a change operation instead of an add operation.
</li>
<li>seqNumFailure indicates that the TAMP message could not be processed because the processing of the sequence number, which is described in Section 6, resulted in an error.
</li>
<li>contingencyPublicKeyDecrypt indicates that the update could not be processed because an error occurred while decrypting the contingency public key.
</li>
<li>incorrectTarget indicates that the query, update, or adjust message could not be processed because the cryptographic module is not the intended recipient.  The target cryptographic module is identified in one of two ways.  HardwareModule identifies the cryptographic module by the module type and serial number; in which case, either one or both of these values does not match the responding cryptographic module.  Alternatively, community identifies a group of cryptographic modules; in which case, the responding cryptographic module does not belong to the identified group.
</li>
<li>communityUpdateFailed indicates that the community update requested the addition of a community identifier or the removal of a community identifier, but the request could not be honored.
</li>
<li>trustAnchorNotFound indicates that a change to a trust anchor was requested, but the referenced trust anchor is not represented in the cryptographic module.
</li>
<li>unsupportedTAAlgorithm indicates that an update message would result in the trust anchor with a public key associated with a digital signature validation algorithm that is not implemented in the cryptographic module.  In addition, this status code is used if the algorithm is supported, but the parameters associated with the algorithm are not supported.
</li>
<li>unsupportedTAKeySize indicates that the trust anchor would include a public key of a size that is not supported.
</li>
<li>unsupportedContinPubKeyDecryptAlg indicates that the decryption algorithm for the apex trust anchor contingency public key is not supported.

Sequence Number Processing</h3>

<p>The sequence number processing facilities in TAMP represent a balance between replay protection, operational considerations, and cryptographic module memory management.  The goal is to provide replay protection without making TAMP difficult to use, creating an environment where surprising error conditions occur on a regular basis, or imposing onerous memory management requirements on implementations.  This balance is achieved by performing sequence number checking on TAMP messages that are signed directly by a trust anchor, and skipping these checks whenever the TAMP message originator is represented by a certificate.
</p>
<p>The TAMP Status Query, Trust Anchor Update, Apex Trust Anchor Update, Community Update, and Sequence Number Adjust messages include a sequence number.  This single-use identifier is used to match a TAMP message with the response to that TAMP message.  When the TAMP message is signed directly by a trust anchor, the sequence number is also used to detect TAMP message replay.
</p>
<p>To provide replay protection, each TAMP message originator MUST treat the sequence number as a monotonically increasing non-negative integer.  The sequence number counter is associated with the signing operation performed by the private key.  The cryptographic module MUST ensure that a newly received TAMP message that is validated directly by a trust anchor public key contains a sequence number that is greater than the most recent successfully processed TAMP message from that originator.  Note that the Sequence Number Adjust message is considered valid if the sequence number is greater than or equal to the most recent successfully processed TAMP message from that originator.  If the sequence number in a received TAMP message does not meet these conditions, then the cryptographic module MUST reject the TAMP message, returning a sequence number failure (seqNumFailure) error.
</p>
<p>
        Whenever a trust anchor is authorized for TAMP messages, either as a newly installed trust anchor or as a modification to an existing trust anchor, if a sequence number value is not provided in the Trust Anchor Update message, memory MUST be allocated for the sequence number and set to zero.  The first TAMP message signed by that trust anchor is not rejected based on sequence number checks, and the sequence number from that first TAMP message is stored.  The sequence number for that trust anchor could also be updated by the OPTIONAL sequence number field of a Trust Anchor Update message that is received after the trust anchor is installed.
        The TAMP message recipient MUST maintain a database of the most recent sequence number from a successfully processed TAMP message from each trust anchor.  The index for this database is the trust anchor public key.  This could be the apex trust anchor operational public key or a management trust anchor public key.  In the first case, the apex trust anchor operational public key is used directly to validate the TAMP message digital signature.  In the second case, a management trust anchor public key is used directly to validate the TAMP message digital signature.
      
</p>
<p>Sequence number values MUST be 64-bit non-negative integers.  Since ASN.1 encoding of an INTEGER always includes a sign bit, a TAMP message signer can generate 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 TAMP messages before exhausting the 64-bit sequence number space, before which the TAMP message signer MUST transition to a different public/private key pair.  The ability to reset a sequence number provided by the Trust Anchor Update and Sequence Number Adjust messages is not intended to avoid the transition to a different key pair; rather, it is intended to aid recovery from operational errors.  A relatively small non-volatile storage requirement is imposed on the cryptographic module for the apex trust anchor and each management trust anchor.
</p>
<p>When the apex trust anchor or a management trust anchor is replaced or removed from the cryptographic module, the associated sequence number storage SHOULD be reclaimed.

Subordination Processing</h3>

<p>The apex trust anchor is unconstrained, which means that subordination checking is not performed on Trust Anchor Update messages signed with the apex trust anchor operational public key.  Subordination checking is performed as part of the validation process of all other Trust Anchor Update messages.
</p>
<p>For a Trust Anchor Update message that is not signed with the apex trust anchor operational public key to be valid, the digital signature MUST be validated using a management trust anchor associated with the id-ct-TAMP-update content type, either directly or via an X.509 certification path originating with the apex trust anchor operational public key or such a management trust anchor.  The following subordination checks MUST also be performed as part of validation.
</p>
<p>Each Trust Anchor Update message contains one or more individual updates, each of which is used to add, modify or remove a trust anchor.  For each individual update the privileges of the TAMP message signer MUST be greater than or equal to the privileges of the trust anchor in the update.  The privileges of the TAMP message signer and the to-be-updated trust anchor are determined based on the applicable CMS Content Constraints. Specifically, the privileges of the TAMP message signer are determined as described in section 3 of <a class='info' href='#CCC'>[CCC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and C. Wallace, &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Signature Constraints X.509 Certificate Extension,&rdquo; in progress.</span><span>)</span></a> passing the special value anyContentType and an empty set of attributes as input; the privileges of the to-be-updated trust anchor are determined as described below.  If the privileges of a trust anchor in an update exceed the privileges of the signer, that update MUST be rejected.  Each update is considered and accepted or rejected individually without regard to other updates in the TAMP message. The privileges of the to-be-updated trust anchors are determined as follows:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the to-be-updated trust anchor is the subject of an add operation, the privileges are read from the taType.mgmt.taUsage field of the corresponding TrustAnchorInfo in the update.
</li>
<li>If the to-be-updated trust anchor is the subject of a remove operation, the trust anchor is located in the message recipient's trust anchor store using the public key included in the update.  The privileges are read from the taType.mgmt.taUsage (or equivalent) field in the to-be-updated trust anchor.
</li>
<li>If the to-be-updated trust anchor is the subject of a change operation, the trust anchor has two distinct sets of privileges that MUST be checked.  The trust anchor's pre-change privileges are determined by locating the trust anchor in the message recipient's trust anchor store using the public key included in the update and reading the privileges from the taType.mgmt.taUsage (or equivalent) field in the trust anchor.  The trust anchor's post-change privileges are read from the taType.mgmt.taUsage field of the corresponding TrustAnchorChangeInfo in the update.  If the taType.mgmt.taUsage field is not present, then the trust anchor’s post-change privileges are equivalent to the trust anchor’s pre-change privileges.
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p>The following steps can be used to determine if a Trust Anchor Update message signer is authorized to manage each to-be-updated trust anchor contained in a Trust Anchor Update message.
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The TAMP message signer's CMS Content Constraints privileges are determined as described in section 3 of <a class='info' href='#CCC'>[CCC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and C.

Note that it is possible for the TAMP message signer to have more than one possible certification path that will authorize it to sign Trust Anchor Update messages, with each certification path resulting in different CMS Content Constraints privileges.  The update is authorized if the processing below succeeds for any one certification path of the TAMP message signer.  The resulting cms_permitted_content_types variable is used to check each to-be-updated trust anchor contained in the update message.  The message signer MUST be authorized for the Trust Anchor Update message.  This can be confirmed using the steps described in section 4 of <a class='info' href='#CCC'>[CCC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and C. Wallace, &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Signature Constraints X.509 Certificate Extension,&rdquo; in progress.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The privileges of each to-be-updated trust anchor in the TAMP message MUST be checked against the message signer's privileges (represented in the message signer’s cms_permitted_content_types computed above) using the following steps.  For change operations, the following steps MUST be performed for the trust anchor's pre-change privileges and the trust anchor's post-change privileges.
            
<ul class="text">
<li>Operations on identity trust anchors are permitted provided the message signer is authorized for the Trust Anchor Update message.
</li>
<li>If the to-be-updated trust anchor is unconstrained, the message signer MUST also be unconstrained, i.e., the message signer’s cms_permitted_content_types MUST be set to the special value anyContentType.  If the to-be-updated trust anchor is unconstrained and the message signer is not, then the message signer is not authorized to manage the trust anchor and the update MUST be rejected.
</li>
<li>The message signer's authorization for each permitted content type MUST be checked using the state variables and procedures similar to those described in sections 3.2 and 3.3 of <a class='info' href='#CCC'>[CCC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and C. Wallace, &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Signature Constraints X.509 Certificate Extension,&rdquo; in progress.</span><span>)</span></a>.  For each permitted content type in the to-be-updated trust anchor's privileges,
                
<ul class="text">
<li>Set cms_effective_attributes equal to the value of the attrConstraints field from the permitted content type.
</li>
<li>If the content type does not match an entry in the message signer’s cms_permitted_content_types, the message signer is not authorized to manage the trust anchor and the update MUST be rejected.  Note, the special value anyContentType produces a match for all content types with the resulting matching entry containing the content type, canSource set to TRUE and attrConstraints absent.
</li>
<li>If the content type matches an entry in the message signer’s cms_permitted_content_types, the canSource field of the entry is FALSE and the canSource field in the to-be-updated trust anchor's privilege is TRUE, the message signer is not authorized to manage the trust anchor and the update MUST be rejected.
</li>
<li>If the content type matches an entry in the message signer’s cms_permitted_content_types and the entry's attrConstraints field is present, then constraints MUST be checked.  For each attrType in the entry's attrConstraints, a corresponding attribute MUST be present in cms_effective_attributes containing values from the entry's attrConstraints.  If values appear in the corresponding attribute that are not in the entry's attrConstraints or if there is no corresponding attribute, the message signer is not authorized to manage the trust anchor and the update MUST be rejected.
</li>
</ul>
              
</li>
</ul>
          
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>Once these steps are completed, if the update has not been rejected, then the message signer is authorized to manage the to-be-updated trust anchor.
</p>
<p>Note that a management trust anchor that has only the id-ct-TAMP-update permitted content type is useful only for managing identity trust anchors.  It can sign a Trust Anchor Update message, but it cannot impact a management trust anchor that is associated with any other content type.

Implementation Considerations</h3>

<p>A public key identifier is used to identify a TAMP message signer.  Since there is no guarantee that the same public key identifier is not associated with more than one public key, implementations MUST be prepared for one or more trust anchor to have the same public key identifier.  In practical terms, this means that when a digital signature validation fails, the implementation MUST see if there is another trust anchor with the same public key identifier that can be used to validate the digital signature.  While duplicate public key identifiers are expected to be rare, implementations MUST NOT fail to find the correct trust anchor when they do occur.
</p>
<p>An X.500 distinguished name is used to identify certificate issuers and certificate subjects.  The same X.500 distinguished name can be associated with more than one trust anchor.  However, the trust anchor public key will be different.  The probability that two trust anchors will have the same X.500 distinguished name and the same public key identifier but a different public key is diminishingly small.  Therefore, the authority key identifier certificate extension can be used to resolve X.500 distinguished name collisions.

<a name="rfc.section.9"></a><h3>9.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
        The majority of this specification is devoted to the syntax and semantics of TAMP messages.  It relies on other specifications, especially <a class='info' href='#RFC3852'>[RFC3852]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC3280'>[RFC3280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., Polk, W., Ford, W., and D. Solo, &ldquo;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, for the syntax and semantics of CMS protecting content types and X.509 certificates, respectively.  Since TAMP messages that change the trust anchor state of a cryptographic module are always signed by a Trust Anchor Manager, no further data integrity or data origin authentication mechanisms are needed; however, no confidentiality for these messages is provided.  Similarly, certificates are digitally signed, and no additional data integrity or data origin authentication mechanisms are needed.  Trust anchor configurations, Trust Anchor Manager certificates, and cryptographic module certificates are not intended to be sensitive.  As a result, this specification does not provide for confidentiality of TAMP messages.
      
</p>
<p>Security factors outside the scope of this specification greatly affect the assurance provided.  The procedures used by certification authorities (CAs) to validate the binding of the subject identity to their public key greatly affect the assurance associated with the resulting certificate.  This is particularly important when issuing certificates to other CAs.  In the context of TAMP, the issuance of an end entity certificate under a management trust anchor is an act of delegation.  However, such end entities cannot further delegate.  On the other hand, issuance of a CA certificate under a management trust anchor is an act of delegation where the CA can perform further delegation.  The scope of the delegation can be constrained by including a CMS content constraints certificate extension <a class='info' href='#CCC'>[CCC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and C. Wallace, &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Signature Constraints X.509 Certificate Extension,&rdquo; in progress.</span><span>)</span></a> in a CA certificate.
</p>
<p>X.509 certification path construction involves comparison of X.500 distinguished names.  Inconsistent application of name comparison rules can result in acceptance of invalid X.509 certification paths or rejection of valid ones.  Name comparison can be extremely complex.  To avoid imposing this complexity on cryptographic modules, any certificate profile used with TAMP SHOULD employ simple name structures and impose rigorous restrictions on acceptable distinguished names, including the way that they are encoded.  The goal of that certificate profile should be to enable simple binary comparison.  That is, case conversion, character set conversion, white space compression, and leading and trailing white space trimming SHOULD be avoided.
</p>
<p>Some digital signature algorithms require the generation of random one-time values.  For example, when generating a DSA digital signature, the signer MUST generate a random k value <a class='info' href='#DSS'>[DSS]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;FIPS Pub 186: Digital Signature Standard,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Also, the generation of public/private key pairs relies on random numbers.  The use of an inadequate random number generator (RNG) or an inadequate pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate such cryptographic values can result in little or no security.  An attacker may find it much easier to reproduce the random number generation environment, searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute force searching the whole space.
</p>
<p>Compromise of an identity trust anchor private key permits unauthorized parties to issue certificates that will be acceptable to all cryptographic modules configured with the corresponding identity trust anchor.  The unauthorized private key holder will be limited by the certification path controls associated with the identity trust anchor.  For example, clearance constraints in the identity trust anchor will determine the clearances that will be accepted in certificates that are issued by the unauthorized private key holder.
</p>
<p>Compromise of a management trust anchor private key permits unauthorized parties to generate signed messages that will be acceptable to all cryptographic modules configured with the corresponding management trust anchor.  All devices that include the compromised management trust anchor can be configured as desired by the unauthorized private key holder within the limits of the subordination checks described in Section 7.  If the management trust anchor is associated with content types other than TAMP, then the unauthorized private key holder can generate signed messages of that type.  For example, if the management trust anchor is associated with firmware packages, then the unauthorized private key holder can install different firmware into the cryptographic module.
</p>
<p>Compromise of the Apex Trust Anchor operational private key permits unauthorized parties to generate signed messages that will be acceptable to all cryptographic modules configured with the corresponding apex trust anchor.  All devices that include that apex trust anchor can be configured as desired by the unauthorized private key holder, and the unauthorized private key holder can generate signed messages of any content type.  The contingency private key offers a potential way to recover from such a compromise.
</p>
<p>The compromise of a CA’s private key leads to the same type of problems as the compromise of an identity or a management trust anchor private key.  The unauthorized private key holder will be limited by the certification path controls associated with the trust anchor.  If the CA is subordinate to a management trust anchor, the scope of potential damage caused by a private key compromise is also limited by the CMS content constraints certificate extension <a class='info' href='#CCC'>[CCC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and C. Wallace, &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Signature Constraints X.509 Certificate Extension,&rdquo; in progress.</span><span>)</span></a> in the CA certificate, the CMS content constraints on any superior CA certificates, and the CMS content constraints on the parent management trust anchor.
</p>
<p>The compromise of an end entity private key leads to the same type of problems as the compromise of an identity or a management trust anchor private key, except that the end entity is unable to issue any certificates.  The unauthorized private key holder will be limited by the certification path controls associated with the trust anchor.  If the certified public key is subordinate to a management trust anchor, the scope of potential damage caused by a private key compromise is also limited by the CMS content constraints certificate extension <a class='info' href='#CCC'>[CCC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and C. Wallace, &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Signature Constraints X.509 Certificate Extension,&rdquo; in progress.</span><span>)</span></a> in the end entity certificate, the CMS content constraints on any superior CA certificates, and the CMS content constraints on the parent management trust anchor.
</p>
<p>Compromise of a cryptographic module’s digital signature private key permits unauthorized parties to generate signed TAMP response messages, masquerading as the cryptographic module.
</p>
<p>Premature disclosure of the key-encryption key used to encrypt the apex trust anchor contingency public key may result in early exposure of the apex trust anchor contingency public key.
</p>
<p>To implement TAMP, a cryptographic module needs to be able to parse messages and certificates.  Care must be taken to ensure that there are no implementation defects in the TAMP message parser or the processing that acts on the message content.

ASN.1 Modules</h3>

<p>
        Appendix A.1 provides the normative ASN.1 definitions for the structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in <a class='info' href='#X.680'>[X.680]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;ITU-T Recommendation X.680: Information Technology - Abstract Syntax Notation One,&rdquo; 1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Appendix A.2 provides a module using ASN.1 as defined in <a class='info' href='#X.208'>[X.208]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;ITU-T Recommendation X.208 -             Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1),&rdquo; 1988.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The module in A.2 removes usage of newer ASN.1 features that provide support for limiting the types of elements that may appear in certain SEQUENCE and SET constructions.  Otherwise, the modules are compatible in terms of encoded representation, i.e., the modules are bits-on-the-wire compatible aside from the limitations on SEQUENCE and SET constituents.  A.2 is included as a courtesy to developers using ASN.1 compilers that do not support current ASN.1.
