ABSTRACT:

VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/.  When MPLS 
labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS.  For an MPLS VPN, 
the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is 
typically no more than 30 bytes.  VoIP header compression can 
significantly reduce the VoIP overhead through various compression 
mechanisms.  This is important on access links where bandwidth is 
scarce, and can be important on backbone facilities, especially where 
costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections).  This draft gives a 
problem statement and requirements for end-to-end VoIP header 
compression, possibly over MPLS.

1. Introduction

Voice over IP (VoIP) typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/. 
When MPLS labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS.  For an 
MPLS VPN, the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice 
payload is typically no more than 30 bytes.  The interest in VoIP header 
compression is the possibility of significantly reducing the VoIP 
overhead through various compression mechanisms.  This draft gives a 
problem statement and requirements for end-to-end VoIP header 
compression, possibly over MPLS.

2. Problem Statement

Voice over IP (VoIP) typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/. 
When MPLS labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS.  
Typically, VoIP will use voice compression mechanisms (e.g., G.729) in 
order to conserve bandwidth.  For an MPLS VPN, the packet header is at 
least 48 bytes, while the compressed voice payload is typically no more 
than 30 bytes.  With VoIP header compression, significantly more 
bandwidth could be saved.  Therefore, end-to-end VoIP header 
compression, possibly over MPLS, is required in order to significantly 
reduce the VoIP overhead through compression mechanisms.  The need may 
be important on access links where bandwidth is more scarce, but it 
could be important on backbone facilities, especially where costs are 
high (e.g., some global cross-sections).  For example, carrying VoIP 
headers for the entire voice load of a large domestic network with 300 
million or more calls per day could consume on the order of about 20-40 
gigabits-per-second on the backbone network for headers alone.  This 
overhead could translate into considerable bandwidth capacity.

3. Requirements

End-to-end VoIP header compression, possibly over MPLS, MUST:

a. avoid link-by-link compression/decompression cycles.  Compression 
should be performed end-to-end through the MPLS network, e.g., from CE1 
--> PE1 --> P --> PE2 --> CE2, where CE1 is the compressor and CE2 is 
the decompressor ([E2E-VoMPLS], [E2E-cRTP]).
b. provide for efficient voice transport.
c. support various voice encoding (G.729, G.723.1, etc.).
d. use standard compress/decompress algorithms (e.g., [cRTP], [SIMPLE]).
e. operate in RFC2547 VPN context [MPLS-VPN].
f. operate in MPLS [MPLS-ARCH] networks using either [LDP] or [RSVP] 
   signaling.
g. be scalable to a very large number of CE --> CE flows.
   - use standard protocols to aggregate RSVP-TE signaling (e.g., 
     [RSVP-AGG]).
   - minimize setups of tunnels & call sessions
h. use standard protocols to signal context identification and control 
   information (e.g., [RSVP], [RSVP-TE]).
i. use standard protocols to prioritize packets (e.g., [DIFFSERV, 
   DIFF-MPLS]).
j. use standard protocols to allocate LSP bandwidth (e.g., [DS-TE]).
k. use standard protocols to make [cRTP] more tolerant of packet loss 
   (e.g., [cRTP-ENHANCE]).
l. add minimal delay to the VoIP media flows.

4. Security Considerations

No new requirements.
