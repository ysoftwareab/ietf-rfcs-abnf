                 Multicast VPN Using MPLS P2MP and BIER
                    draft-xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp-00

Abstract

   The Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) specifications defines
   P-tunnels for carrying multicast traffic across the backbone.  A
   variety of P-tunnel types are supported.  Bit Index Explicit
   Replication (BIER) is a new architecture that provides optimal
   multicast forwarding through a "multicast domain", without requiring
   intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state.  The purpose of
   the current document is to specify one way of carrying multicast
   traffic over an SP MPLS backbone network using compatible method and
   encapsulation of BIER.  It uses a pre-build P2MP as the BIER
   topology, and uses mLDP/RSVP-TE protocol extension to build BIER-
   related underlay routing and forwarding information in-band when
   building the P2MP topology.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] specify the protocols and procedures that a
   Service Provider (SP) can use to provide Multicast Virtual Private
   Network (MVPN) service to its customers.  Multicast tunnels are
   created through an SP's backbone network; these are known as
   "P-tunnels".  The P-tunnels are used for carrying multicast traffic
   across the backbone.  The MVPN specifications allow the use of
   several different kinds of P-tunnel technology.  In an MPLS network,
   such P-tunnel can be mLDP P2MP or RSVP-TE P2MP.

Internet-Draft        MVPN Using MPLS P2MP and BIER         October 2017


   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is
   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate routers to
   maintain any per-flow state.

   BIER architecture requires routers participating in BIER to exchange
   BIER related information within a given domain.  BIER architecture
   permits IGP/BGP or any other routing protocols to perform
   distribution of such information.  Such routing protocols are defined
   as Underlay protocols.

   In an MPLS network, [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] define a BIER
   Header within it an initial 4 octets MPLS-Label, to encapsulate
   Multicast packet and transport through the MPLS network.

   The purpose of the current document is to specify one way of carrying
   multicast traffic over an SP MPLS backbone network, using compatible
   method and encapsulation described in the above BIER documents.  It
   uses a pre-build P2MP as the BIER topology, and uses mLDP/RSVP-TE
   protocol extension to build BIER-related underlay routing and
   forwarding information in-band when building the P2MP topology.

2.  Terminology

   Readers of this document are assumed to be familiar with the
   terminology and concepts of the documents listed as Normative
   References.  For convenience, some of the more frequently used terms
   and new terms list below.

   o  LSP: Label Switch Path

   o  LSR: Label Switching Router

   o  P2MP: Point to Multi-point

3.  Use of the PTA in MVPN Routes

3.1.  Overview

   According to [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture], the P2MP LSP based BIER is
   a REAL BIER, which using a P2MP LSP as the underlay topology.  The
   P2MP LSP is not only a LSP, but also a topology as the BIER underlay.
   The P2MP LSP based BIER is P-tunnel, which is used for bearing
   multicast flows.  Every flow can think as binding to an independent
   tunnel, which is constructed by the BitString in the BIER header of
   every packet of the flow.  Multicast flows are transported in SPMSI-
   only mode, on P2MP LSP based BIER tunnels, and never directly on P2MP
   LSP tunnel.

3.2.  Use of the PTA in x-PMSI A-D Routes

   As defined in [RFC6514], the PMSI Tunnel attribute (PTA) carried by
   an x-PMSI A-D route identifies the P-tunnel that is used to
   instantiate a particular PMSI.  If a PMSI is to be instantiated by
   P2MP LSP based BIER, the PTA is constructed by a BFIR, which is also
   a Ingress LSR.  This document defines the following Tunnel Types:

   + TBD - RSVP-TE P2MP LSP based BIER

   + TBD - mLDP P2MP LSP based BIER

   Allocation is expected from IANA for two new tunnel type codepoints
   from the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel
   Types" registry.  These codepoints will be used to indicate that the
   PMSIs is instantiated by MLDP or RSVP-TE extension with support of
   BIER.

   When the Tunnel Type is set to RSVP-TE P2MP LSP based BIER, the
   Tunnel Identifier include two parts, as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

   in section 2 of [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation].

   Tunnel Number: A 1 octet field encoding the Number of the Tunnel
   range.  It MUST be greater than 0.

   <Extended Tunnel ID, Reserved, Tunnel Range Base, P2MP ID>: A ID as
   carried in the RSVP-TE P2MP LSP SESSION Object defined in [RFC4875].

   The "Tunnel Range" is the set of P2MP LSPs beginning with the Tunnel
   Range base and ending with ((Tunnel Range base)+(Tunnel Number)- 1).
   A unique Tunnel Range is allocated for the BSL and a Sub-domain-ID
   implicited by the P2MP.

   The size of the Tunnel Range is determined by the number of Set
   Identifiers (SI) (section 1 of [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]) that are
   used in the topology of the P2MP-LSP.  Each SI maps to a single
   Tunnel in the Tunnel Range.  The first Tunnel is for SI=0, the second
   Tunnel is for SI=1, etc.

   When the Tunnel Type is set to mLDP P2MP LSP based BIER, the Tunnel
   Identifier include two parts, as follows:

   element, defined in [RFC6388].

   The "Tunnel Range" is the set of P2MP LSPs beginning with the Tunnel
   Range base and ending with ((Tunnel Range base)+(Tunnel Number)- 1).
   A unique Tunnel Range is allocated for the BSL and a Sub-domain-ID
   implicited by the P2MP.

   The size of the Tunnel Range is determined by the number of Set
   Identifiers (SI) (section 1 of [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]) that are
   used in the topology of the P2MP-LSP.  Each SI maps to a single
   Tunnel in the Tunnel Range.  The first Tunnel is for SI=0, the second
   Tunnel is for SI=1, etc.

   When the Tunnel Type is any of the above two, The "MPLS label" field
   OPTIONAL contain an upstream-assigned non-zero MPLS label.  It is
   assigned by the router (a BFIR) that constructs the PTA.  Absence of
   an MPLS Label is indicated by setting the MPLS Label field to zero.

   When the Tunnel Type is any of the above two, two of the flags, LIR
   and LIR-pF, in the PTA "Flags" field are meaningful.  Details about
   the use of these flags can be found in [RFC6513],
   [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-expl-track] and [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn]].

3.3.  Use of the PTA in Leaf A-D routes

   Before an egress PE can receive a (C-S,C-G) flow from a given ingress
   PE via RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP LSP based BIER, the egress PE must have
   received one of the following x-PMSI A-D routes from the ingress PE:

   o  A "more specific" x-PMSI A-D route, (C-S,C-G) S-PMSI A-D route.

   o  A "less specific" x-PMSI A-D route, (C-*,C-*), (C-*,C-G), or
      (C-S,C-*) S-PMSI A-D route.

   In which, the PTA tunnel Type is "RSVP-TE P2MP LSP based BIER" or
   "MLDP P2MP LSP based BIER".

   The rules for determining which x-PMSI A-D route is the match for
   reception are given in [RFC6625].  If such a route is found, we refer
   to it as the "matching x-PMSI A-D route."  If no matching x-PMSI A-D
   route for (C-S,C-G) is found, the egress PE cannot receive the
   (C-S,C-G) flow from the ingress PE via RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP LSP based
   BIER until such time as a matching route is received.

Internet-Draft        MVPN Using MPLS P2MP and BIER         October 2017


   When an egress PE determines that it needs to receive a (C-S,C-G)
   flow from a particular ingress PE via RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP LSP based
   BIER, it originates a Leaf A-D route.  Construction of the Leaf A-D
   route generally follows the procedures specified in [RFC6514], or
   optionally, the procedures specified in [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-expl-
   track].  However, when RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP LSP based BIER is being
   used, the Leaf A-D route MUST carry a PTA that is constructed as
   follows:

   1.  The tunnel type MUST be set to RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP LSP based BIER,
       corresponding to the PTA of the matching x-PMSI A-D route.

   2.  The MPLS label field SHOULD be set to zero.

   3.  The BFR-Prefix field of the Tunnel Identifier field MUST be set
       to the egress PE's IP-Address.  This IP-Address is the same as
       the Originating Router's IP Addr field of the NLRI of the Leaf
       A-D route.

   When an ingress PE receives such a Leaf A-D route, it learns the BFR-
   Prefix of the egress PE from the PTA.  The ingress PE does not make
   any use the value of the PTA's MPLS label field.

   Failure to properly construct the PTA cannot always be detected by
   the protocol, and will cause improper delivery of the data packets.

4.  P2MP LSP based BIER Forwarding Procedures

   The MVPN application plays the role of the "multicast flow overlay"
   as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   This section specifies some OPTIONAL rules for forwarding a BIER-
   encapsulated data packet within a P2MP topology underlay.

   These rules will produce the same results as the procedures in [I-
   D.ietf-bier-architecture], on condition that the underlay topology is
   a P2MP.

4.1.  Overview

   As [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] describes:

   1.  BIER support using the default topology of the unicast IGP as the
       routing underlay.  To quote from [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]:
       "By default, each sub-domain uses the default topology of the
       unicast IGP as the routing underlay."





Xie                      Expires April 30, 2018                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        MVPN Using MPLS P2MP and BIER         October 2017


   2.  BIER also support using other topologies as the routing underlay,
       including a tree topology.  To quote from [I-D.ietf-bier-
       architecture]: "Alternatively, one could deploy a routing
       underlay that creates a multicast-specific tree of some sort.
       Then BIER could be used to forward multicast data packets along
       the multicast-specific tree, while unicast packets follow the
       'ordinary' OSPF best path."

   This document specifies one OPTIONAL Forwarding Procedure of BIER
   encapsulation packet, on the condition that the BIER underlay
   topology is P2MP LSP, as describes in the above sections.  Comparing
   to the Forwarding Procedure, which is described in [I-D.ietf-bier-
   architecture], and which is on a underlay of unicast IGP topology,
   there is some simplification:

   1.  Not need to Edit the BitString when forwarding packet to
       Neighbor, for the underlay P2MP topology is already loop-free.

   2.  Not need to use Entropy in the BIER Header, for current P2MP
       topology is already ECMP-eliminate.

   The optional BIER forwarding procedure is, on the basis of P2MP
   forwarding procedure according to the BIER-MPLS label, and use the
   BitString to prune the undesired P2MP downstream.

   The enhancement to the P2MP forwarding is to add a Forwarding BitMask
   to existing NHLFE defined in [RFC3031], for checking with the
   BitString in a packet, to determin whether the packet is to be
   forwarded or pruned.  If the checking result by AND'ing a packet's
   BitString with the F-BM of the NHLFE (i.e., Packet->BitString &=
   F-BM) is non-zero, then forward the packet to the next-hop indicated
   by the NHLFE entry, and the Label is switched to the proper one in
   the NHLFE.  If the result is zero, then do not forward the packet to
   the next-hop indicated by the NHLFE entry.

4.2.  Building P2MP LSP based BIER forwarding state

   When RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP LSP based BIER are used, then it is not
   nessary to use IGP or BGP to build the BIER routing table and
   forwarding table.  Instead, the BIER layer information is carried by
   MLDP or RSVP-TE, and when MLDP or RSVP-TE build P2MP LSP, it build
   the BIER forwarding state in-band.

   The procedure for building RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP LSP based BIER
   forwarding state using mLDP or RSVP-TE is outside the scope of this
   document.

Internet-Draft        MVPN Using MPLS P2MP and BIER         October 2017


4.3.  Live-Live protection

   As described above, loop and redundancy, ECMP and Entropy, are all
   not supported in current P2MP LSP underlay.  There will be extra P2MP
   LSP convergence, after IGP convergence, in the case of link or node
   failure.

   On the other hand, Multicast has special Service Level
   Aggrement(SLA), especially when multicast service is compressed or
   uncompressed video.  Accordingly, there are some multicast-specific
   methods of protection, such as Live-Live.  [RFC7431] defines a method
   of detecting failure locally by comparing the packets received from
   live-live paths.  [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-fast-failover] defines a Live-
   Live method for protecting Multicast in MVPN.

   This document specifies one OPTIONAL extension to enhance Live-Live
   protection, re-using the Entropy field of BIER header as a Sequence
   number of multicast packet, on the condition that the field is not
   used for ECMP, such as in the P2MP LSP topology described above.

   This is an optional function of BIER Layer.  If this function is
   enabled, every BFR of the domain is required to support, which means:

   1.  The BFIR (and Ingress LSR) will push a sequence-number in the
       Entropy field, per-flow per-packet.

   2.  The middle BFR will ignore the Entropy field, and not do the
       selection of multi-tables.

   3.  The BFER (and Egress LSR) will do packet check from live-live
       paths, and do forward packet with zero packet loss, on a per-flow
       basis.

5.  Provisioning Considerations

   P2MP LSP based BIER use concepts of both RSVP-TE/MLDP and BIER.  Some
   provisioning considerations list below:

   Sub-domain:

   In P2MP LSP based BIER, every P2MP LSP is a specific BIER underlay
   topology, and an implicit Sub-domain.  RSVP-TE/MLDP build the BIER
   information of the implicit sub-domain when build P2MP LSP.  MVPN get
   the implicit sub-domain when specified with which RSVP-TE/MLDP P2MP
   LSP.

   In the following conditions, there may be requirements to configure
   an explicit sub-domain ID for P2MP LSP based BIER:

   1.  P2MP LSP based BIER, use the native procedure of forwarding
       described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture], which require
       Consistent Per-Sub-domain BIFT.

   2.  P2MP LSP based BIER is shared by multiple VPNs, and an explicit
       sub-domain ID is configured as anchor for using by these VPNs.

   When explicitly configing a sub-domain ID for P2MP LSP based BIER,
   the ID should be great than 255.  For the [0-255] has been defined to
   use by IGP, BGP and MVPN, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-ospf-bier-extensions],
   [I-D.ietf-bier-isis-extensions], [I-D.ietf-bier-idr-extensions] and
   [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn].

   BFR-prefix:

   In P2MP LSP based BIER, every BFR is also a LSR.  So the BFR-prefix
   in the sub-domain is by default identified by LSR-id.  Additionally,
   When BFR/LSR is also a MVPN PE, BFR-prefix is also the same as
   Originating Router's IP Address of x-PMSI A-D route or Leaf A-D
   route.

   BFR-id:

   When using protocols like RSVP-TE, which initializes P2MP LSP from a
   specific Ingress Node, BFR-id which is unique in P2MP LSP scope, can
   be auto-provisioned by Ingress Node, or conventionally configure on
   every Egress Nodes.

   BSL and BIER-MPLS Label Block Size:

   In P2MP LSP based BIER, Every P2MP LSP or implicit sub-domain
   requires a single BSL, and a specific BIER-MPLS Label block size for
   this BSL.

   VPN-Label:

   In P2MP LSP based BIER, a P2MP LSP based BIER 'P-tunnel' can be
   shared by multiple VPNs or a single VPN.  When a P2MP LSP based BIER
   being shared by multiple VPNs, an Upstream-assigned VPN-Label is
   required.  It can be auto-provisioned or manual configured by the
   BFIR or Ingress LSR.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Allocation is expected from IANA for two new tunnel type codepoints
   for "RSVP-TE P2MP LSP based BIER" and "MLDP P2MP LSP based BIER" from
