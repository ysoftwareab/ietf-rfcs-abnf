1. Introduction

   The IP Payload Compression Protocol allows the compression of IP
   datagrams by supporting different compression algorithms.  This
   document describes how to integrate the DEFLATE compression
   algorithm [Deutsch96] into IPCOMP [IPCOMP].

   This document SHOULD be read in conjunction with [IPCOMP] and MUST
   be taken in its context.


1.1 Specification of Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
   NOT", and "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in [Bradner97].


2. DEFLATE Algorithm Implementation

   The DEFLATE compression algorithm was designed by Phil Katz and its
   details are publicly available in [Deutsch96].  Thus it is a good
   freely available algorithm to implement within IPCOMP.

   Compression and decompression algorithm details should be followed
   as outlined in [Deutsch96] or the use of a software library may be
   preferable.


2.1 Compression

   As defined in [IPCOMP], the compression process is determined by
   the IP Compression Association (IPCA).  The IPCA MUST define the
   DEFLATE algorithm for the process within this document to take
   place.

   The compression process entails compressing the data from the IP
   datagram and placing the result after the IPComp header.  For
   example, compressing a TCP datagram;

   Before:  IP TCP ...
   After:   IP IPCOMP (TCP ...)

   Please note how everything after the IPCOMP header is compressed.


2.2 Decompression

   As in the compression process, the IPCA defines the parameters and
   algorithm to utilize for the decompression process.

   As defined in [IPCOMP] the data after the IPComp header is
   decompressed and replaces the IPComp header within the IP header.

   Decompression using the DEFLATE algorithm follows the decompression
   process defined in [Deutsch96].


3. Security Considerations

   This document does not add any further security considerations that
   [IPCOMP] and [Deutsch96] have already declared.
