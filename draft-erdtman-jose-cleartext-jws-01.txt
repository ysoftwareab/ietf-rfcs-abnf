                   Cleartext JSON Web Signature (JWS)
                  draft-erdtman-jose-cleartext-jws-01

Abstract

   Cleartext JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a means of signing JSON objects
   directly without representing the JSON to be signed in a non-JSON
   representation, such as base64url-encoded JSON.  The signature and
   information about the signature is added to the JSON object when it
   is signed.  The signature calculation for signing the JSON object
   uses the JSON canonicalization defined by
   [I-D.rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme].  Cleartext JWS builds on
   the JWS, JWA, and JWK specifications, reusing data structures and
   semantics from these specifications, where applicable.

1.  Introduction

   Cleartext JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents a signed JSON object
   directly as a JSON object [RFC8259], without representing the JSON to
   be signed in a non-JSON representation, such as base64url-encoded
   JSON.  The signature and information about the signature is added to
   the JSON object when it is signed.  The signature calculation for
   signing the JSON object uses the JSON canonicalization defined by
   [I-D.rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme].  By including the

   signature information in the JSON object to be signed, it is easy to
   inspect data in transit and when archived, integrity can be
   guaranteed.

   Cleartext JWS builds on the JWS [RFC7515], JWA [RFC7518], and JWK
   [RFC7517] specifications, reusing data structures and semantics from
   these specifications, where applicable.  Cryptographic algorithm
   identifiers used by this specification come from the IANA "JSON Web
   Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry [IANA.JOSE.Algorithms].

   There are three essential differences between Cleartext JWS and JWS:

   o  Cleartext JWS can only sign JSON objects, rather than arbitrary
      data.

   o  Cleartext JWS signature information is included within the signed
      data.

   o  Cleartext JWS depends on predictable JSON Serialization, rather
      than base64url-encoding the data to be signed.

   The table below is a comparison of JWS and Cleartext JWS:

   +-------------------------------+----------------+------------------+
   |                               | JWS            | Cleartext JWS    |
   +-------------------------------+----------------+------------------+
   | Data to be Signed             | Arbitrary data | JSON or          |
   |                               |                | JavaScript       |
   |                               |                | objects          |
   | Encoding of Signed Data       | Base64url      | None             |
   | Encoding of Header Parameters | Base64url      | None             |
   | URL Friendly                  | Core feature   | Out of scope     |
   +-------------------------------+----------------+------------------+

   In the following example, note that the signature information is
   included in the JSON object.  The members in the
   "__cleartext_signature" object are the JWS Header Parameters for the
   signature.  The "signature" member contains the base64url-encoded
   signature value.  (Line breaks within values are for display purposes
   only.)

   }

   The key in Appendix A.3 can be used for verifying the example
   signature.

   Note: Recreating the example signature using the example private key
   would normally result in a different "signature" value since ECDSA
   includes random data in the signature calculation.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Signature Object

   When signing JSON data with Cleartext JWS, a JSON object with the JWS
   Header Parameters is created and placed within the JSON data to be
   signed.  In addition to the already defined JWS Header Parameters,
   Cleartext JWS defines two new Header Parameters: "signature" for the
   base64url-encoded signature value and "signers" to support multiple
   signers within the same signature object.

   The identifier for the Cleartext Signature Object in the JSON data to
   be signed MUST be "__cleartext_signature", unless the application
   specifies that a different identifier is to be used.

3.1.  Signature Scope

   The scope of a signature (the data that is actually signed) comprises
   all values including child objects of the signature object except for
   the "signature" member.  If multiple signers are present, only the
   data pertaining to all signers and the data specific to that signer

   are included (but not the data specific to other signers).  See
   Section 4.3 for more about the multiple signatures case.

3.2.  The "signature" Header Parameter

   The "signature" Header Parameter contains the base64url-encoded JWS
   Signature as a string.

3.3.  The "signers" Header Parameter

   The optional "signers" Header Parameter contains an array of sets of
   Header Parameters that are specific to each signer, including the
   "signature" value for each signer.  See Section 4.3 for more about
   the multiple signatures case.

4.  Producing and Consuming Cleartext JWSs

4.1.  Message Signature or MAC Computation

   To create a Cleartext JWS, the following steps are performed.  The
   order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no
   dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   1.  Create the application specific JSON object to be signed.  In
       this step the JSON should not be canonicalized.

   2.  Create the "__cleartext_signature" object with the Header
       Parameters to be used and add it as a top-level member to the
       JSON object to be signed with the key "__cleartext_signature".

   3.  Canonicalize the JOSN object to be signed using the
       canocalization process defined by
       [I-D.rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme].  Let the output of
       the canonicalization be the cleartext input to the signature
       algorithm.

   4.  Compute the JWS Signature in the manner defined for the
       particular algorithm being used over the canonicalize JSON object
       to be signed.  The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter MUST be
       present in the "__cleartext_signature" member, with the algorithm
       value accurately representing the algorithm used to construct the
       JWS Signature.

   5.  Add the "signature" member to the signature object
       (__cleartext_signature) within the original application JSON
       object.  with the value BASE64URL(JWS Signature).

4.2.  Message Signature or MAC Validation

   When validating a Cleartext JWS, the following steps are performed.
   The order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no
   dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.  If any of
   the listed steps fails, then the input MUST be rejected.

   When there are multiple JWS Signature values, it is an application
   decision which of the JWS Signature values must successfully validate
   for the Cleartext JWS to be accepted.  In some cases, all must
   successfully validate, or the Cleartext JWS will be considered
   invalid.  In other cases, only a specific JWS Signature value needs
   to be successfully validated.  However, in all cases, at least one
   JWS Signature value MUST successfully validate, or the Cleartext JWS
   MUST be considered invalid.

   1.  Parse the application JSON data, including the signature object.

   2.  Verify that the implementation understands and can process all
       fields that it is required to support, whether required by this
       specification, by the algorithm being used, or by the "crit"
       Header Parameter value, and that the values of those parameters
       are also understood and supported.

   3.  Save and remove the "signature" member from the signature object
       (__cleartext_signature) and base64url-decode the encoded
       representation of the JWS Signature.

   4.  Canonicalize the signed object, including the signature object
       (__cleartext_signature), by following the rules by
       [I-D.rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme] and let the output be
       input to the signature algorithm.

   5.  Validate the JWS Signature against the JWS Signing Input, i.e.,
       the canonicalize data, in the manner defined for the algorithm
       being used, which MUST be accurately represented by the value of
       the "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter value, which MUST be
       present.  Record whether the validation succeeded or not.

   6.  Return a result indicating whether or not the Cleartext JWS was
       successfully validated.

   7.  For later validation of the signed JSON object, put the
       "signature" member back into the signature object
       (__cleartext_signature) within the application JSON object.

4.3.  Multiple Signatures

   Multiple signers using different keys can independently add
   signatures to a JSON object in the manner described in this section.

   The signature procedure is essentially the same as for single
   signatures but also includes the following:

   o  There MUST be an additional JWS Header parameter "signers",
      holding an array of signature objects.

   o  Each signature requires its own canocalization process.  During
      this process, the signature objects for other signatures MUST be
      (temporarily) removed.

   o  The canonicalized data in the "signers" value MUST include the
      array brackets ([]) containing the data specific to this signature
      but MUST NOT include the data for other signatures.  The resulting
      array will be single-valued, with no commas separating additional
      elements.

   o  A given Header Parameter MUST NOT occur in both the top-level
      signature object and a signature object within the "signers"
      value.  Any Header Parameter occurring in the top-level signature
      object applies to all signatures.

   o  A signature object is equivalent to an ordinary signature object,
      but MAY exclude the "alg" Header parameter if it is present in the
      top-level signature object itself.  If in the top-level signature
      object, all enclosed signature objects MUST use the same algorithm
      as well as not including the "alg" Header parameter.  See
      Appendix A.1 for an example.

   o  Likewise, if a "crit" Header parameter is specified in the top-
      level signature object, it MUST be applied to all signature
      objects and MUST NOT be present in them individually.  See
      Appendix A.2 for an example.

   The following example shows a multiply signed object:

     "exp": 1300819380,
     "escapeMe": "\u20ac$\u000F\u000aA'\u0042\u0022\u005c\\\"\/",
     "numbers": [1e+30,4.5,6],
     "__cleartext_signature": {
       "alg": "ES256",
       "signers": [{
         "kid": "example.com:p256",
         "signature": "En1Iyg45g1HBsxYdu-SR1fjt2nixOEtMWRrVA9EO7N8QfZtrs
