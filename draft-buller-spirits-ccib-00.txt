Abstract 
   
   This  Internet Draft has arisen  out of  work  concentrating  on  the 
   interconnection  of IP  and the  Public  Switched  Telephone  Network 
   (PSTN) undertaken within the PINT and SPIRITS working group.

   This Internet  Draft  describes an  implementation  architecture  for 
   co-operative  services  initiated  from either  the PSTN  or Internet 
   domains.  It further describes  how this architecture  may be used in 
   provision of a Call Completion Internet Busy (CCIB) aka Internet Call 
   Waiting (ICW) service.

2. Introduction

   The primary considered service to date, with regard to the efforts of 
   the SPIRITS working group, is that of  Internet Call Waiting ICW (aka 
   Call Completion Internet Busy, or CCIB).

   The CCIB service allows users who are logged onto the Internet (using
   for example,  a dial up account) to determine  the completion actions 
   for telephony calls  attempted to the telephone  number that they are 
   presently using  for this connection.  Examples of these  'completion 
   actions' might be :

     o Refuse the call. 
     o Forward the call to Voice Mail.
     o Forward the call to another number.
     o Drop the Internet connection and take the telephony call over the 
       same line.
     o Establish VoIP connection on terminating side to take the call.
     o Take details of the callee for later connection.
     o Take a voice message which can then be relayed to the terminating 
       end device.

   This document briefly describes  how implementation of such a service 
   could be undertaken using both PINT and some other protocol (possibly 
   aligned with the SPIRITS architecture).

   Both PINT and SPIRITS are intended to provide mechanisms for requests 
   (or initiation) of service between the Internet and PSTN domains, and
   vice versa.  Requests (initiations) from the Internet to the PSTN and 
   responses to these requests is the  PINT case. Requests from the PSTN
   to the Internet domain and responses to these requests is the SPIRITS
   case. This is shown more clearly in Figure 1.

3. General Requirements 

   This section  attempts to specify an initial set of  requirements and
   service characteristics for an implementation of  CCIB using the PINT
   and SPIRITS paradigms:

     o Use of the  service  MUST be  capable  of being  undertaken  in a 
       secure manner. 

     o Use of this service should be non repudiable.

     o The described  implementation should not be dependent in  ANY way 
       on  specific technology  being deployed  outside of the  Internet 
       domain.

4. Proposed Architecture

   This section initially  discusses the CCIB service  and architectural 
   considerations and  implications. Next, the proposed architecture for 
   the CCIB service which uses PINT and SPIRITS is outlined.

4.1. General architectural and service considerations and implications

   The implementation  detailed in this Internet Draft allows subscibers
   to register for this service. This registration could be forwarded to
   the PSTN domain  using the PINT protocol.  Such a registration may be 
   undertaken each time a subscriber connects to the Internet and wishes 
   to receive (SPIRITS like)  requests. Specific details of what and how
   the PSTN domain  may implement  certain aspects of  this service  are
   considered  outside the scope of  this Internet Draft.  As such, only 
   generalised  functional  descriptions  are provided  and no  specific  
   recommendation or suggestions are proffered. 

   Possible implementations might be that the PSTN domain could :
 
      o Dynamically set flags (service marks) in the  switch relating to
        the subscribers line.  This could indicate that call attempts to
        this number (for the duration of  the current call)  will result
        in the initiation of a SPIRITS service. 

      o An IN system could be used to handle call attempts to busy lines
        over which a subscriber is engaged in an Internet session.

   Indeed, it is entirely  possible in some implementations (say, a Soft 
   Switch providing Internet Offload) that no registration phase will be
   required.  This scenario is not discussed further as this paper deals 
   with the co-operation of PINT/ SPIRITS to provide  enhanced services.
   In implementatations where explicit subscriber registration is deemed 
   to be required  (such as the one detailed in  section 5) registration 
   storage can be undertaken in several locations in either the Internet 
   or PSTN domains. This data can either be :

      o located in the Internet domain and referenced directly by a ICW/ 
        CCIB SPIRITS  client (also  in the Internet domain)  once it has 

Buller                                                          [Page 4]

<draft-ietf-spirits-ccib-01.txt>  CCIB (PINT & SPIRITS)   December, 2000

        received a request from the PSTN (see note below).
   or
      o located in the PSTN domain and referenced  by some entity within
        this domain that then issues the request to the CCIB/ICW SPIRITS
        client in the Internet domain (see note below). In some impleme-
        ntations this request may require some form of resolution within
        the Internet domain to map the request to the current IP address
        of the subscriber.

   Note!  the request  initiated within the PSTN domain  is itself NOT a
   SPIRITS request.  This interface/ invocation mechanism  is considered  
   (by the author) to be  out of scope, very likely to be implementation
   specific and most probably proprietary in nature.  Differentiation of 
   this interface  from that  provided by the SPIRITS protocol  has been 
   the source of some apparent confusion.  However, if we take a  closer 
   look at the  PSTN interface identified in  Figure 1. and add  some of 
   the functional components, originally specified in the PINT protocol, 
   and then  apply a similar  paradigm to SPIRITS  the situation becomes 
   clearer.

<draft-ietf-spirits-ccib-01.txt>  CCIB (PINT & SPIRITS)   December, 2000

   can be seen  that the SoP interface itself will vary dependent on the 
   implemenation decisions made.  However, as previously stated, the SoP
   interface is considered to be out of scope of this Internet Draft.
   
   Upon receipt of  an initiation request  from some entity  in the PSTN 
   domain,  the request is passed to  the SPIRITS client in  the SPIRITS 
   gateway for formulation of SPIRITS message(s).  These messages may be 
   used to gain further information from entities in the Internet domain 
   or to initiate/ request SPIRITS services directly. 

4.2. Proposed Architecture 

   This  section identifies  and  describes  the architectural  entities 
   identified in Figure 1 and how these relate to the provision of 'one' 
   possible implementation of a CCIB service discussed in more detail in 
   section 5 of this document.  Various implementations  may locate this 
   functionality in different places or domains (PSTN or Internet). Some 
   entities may not be required  in other possible implementations.  The 
   entities within this proposed implementation are :

      PSTN
      An entity in the PSTN  domain (e.g. IN or Soft Switch) initiates a 
      request for  service from this  domain to the Internet domain.  As 
      previously discussed (in Section 4.1.) this  does not mean that it
      directly passes SPIRITS requests.  Instead requests are  issued to 
      the SPIRITS gateway where the SPIRITS client constructs and issues
      SPIRITS requests.

      User equipment
      In the implementation detailed in this  document the user connects 
      to Internet  using a  dial up account from equipment  suitable for
      such connectivity. User equipment will have a small SPIRITS server
      for  receiving SPIRITS  requests and 'possibly'  a PINT Client for 
      registration and  initiation of PINT services.  These entities may
      have been  previously downloaded or may be downloaded  each time a
      subscriber  registers that they are connected  and wish to be able 
      to use PINT and SPIRITS services. 

      Web Server 
      Provides a mechanism  for subscribers  to register for  receipt of 
      SPIRITS messages.
    
      SPIRITS client
      Contained within the  SPIRITS gateway (see Figure 2),  it receives 
      initiating requests from the PSTN and formulates them into SPIRITS
      requests.

      SPIRITS server
      Receives and handles SPIRITS requests.  As previously stated, this 
      server could  either be initially  downloaded and used after  each 
      subsequent registration, or,  downloaded each time  as part of the 
      registration process.

      Subscriber data store
      Maintains subscriber details and registration requests.

5. Implementation Scenario 

   Figures 3 and 4 briefly detail an implementation for provisioning the
   Call Completion Internet Busy  (CCIB) service. These figures identify
   the objects and the sequence of flows required and are split into two
   for clarity.  The first provides details of how  registration for use 
   of the service is made.  The second details how the user is contacted
   after a call attempt has been made,  and how their choice,  as to how 
   to handle the call, is then relayed to the initiative system.

5.1 Service Registration Phase

   There are at least two mechanisms (excluding the Soft Switch Internet 
   Handoff scenario indentified in Section 4.1),  each with a variety of 
   flavours,  in which the registration  and setup for this service  may
   occur.  Each of  these depends on the  various business  models which
   different vendors might wish to implement:

     1) The service may be implemented by use of an  explicit binding to
        a telephony  subscriber's known (billable) number.  The customer
        may then either register or  subscribe to the service  when they
        connect to the Internet.  This registration could be held in the
        PSTN domain where receipt of a  call attempt to a busy telephone 
        number  may directly result in a service request, or result in a 
        check of a data store of current registrands  in the PSTN domain
        before the service is requested. 

        Alternatively,  the registration information may  be held in the 
        Internet domain,  and the PSTN system may query  this store, and
        activate the service, when the  line is found to be engaged.

        This type of implementation  is inherently more secure  than the
        next option due to the explicit binding  to  a telephone number. 
        Mechanisms can more easily be  provided to require registrations
        from this line for the subscriber. 

     2) The  second  scenario  could allow a  subscriber to  register at
        whatever telephone number they happen to be using for their dial
        up connection.  Once on-line they would register to the service. 
        This  registration could  contain  the currently  used telephone 
        number though  this provides further security risks  (e.g. wrong 
        number specification by fault or design).  

        This proposal could allow  subscribers to register in a portable 
        fashion from any number.

        This might be less satisfactory than 1 (above) in terms of phone
        number security i.e. in tying such service provision to a number
        by what an ISP clients 'says'.  However,  some implementation of
        Calling Line Identitity (CLI) could be used by the ISP to obtain
        this  number directly.  It is  most likely  that there  would be 

Buller                                                          [Page 7]

<draft-ietf-spirits-ccib-01.txt>  CCIB (PINT & SPIRITS)   December, 2000

        a requirement for interworking and/ or Service Level  Agreements
        (SLA) between the ISP and telephony operator in order to  secure
        such a service.  Such interworking is outside  the scope of this
        Internet Draft.  

        The maintenance of the subscribers registration could follow the
        same lines as those discussed in 1) above. 

        This option is inherently less  secure than that suggested in 1)

   The description of the flows shown above is as follows :

     1. The user connects.

     2. The user (or their ISP) submits Registration details  containing
        CSeq, IP address, telephone number and keys to a web server.

     3. The PINT  registration message is  constructed and sent  to PINT 
        server

     4. The user details provided are then checked  against subscription
        details and possibly CLI. These details are then stored.

     5. The response message is constructed and returned to PINT client.

     6. The PINT client informs the Web Server of the status.  

     7. If the response  message to the  registration indicates  that it
        was accepted,  a 'thin' SPIRITS  server  applet is  sent to  the  
        users machine.  Only a thin SPIRITS server would be  required to 
        handle requests as the exact format of possible SPIRITS requests
        would be known for this service.

5.1.2. Call Attempt Phase

The description of the flows shown below (in figure 4) is as follows :

    1.  The call attempt is made.  The PSTN/ IN detects call in progress 
        and busy SPIRITS subscriber line.  It then plays an announcement
        to the calling party.  Next, the PSTN/ IN initiates a request to 
        the SPIRITS client,  using some  other protocol  (which could be 
        INAP).

    2.  The SPIRITS client issues the SPIRITS invitation request. 

    3.  Presently registered details are looked up.

    4.  The final SPIRITS  invitation  request is constructed  and sent. 
        Then one of two things can occur detailed in 4a and 4b.

    4a. The invitation request is received by the called party. Continue
        to flow 5.

    4b. The invitation request does not reach the intended recipient  or
        times out.   A failure message is returned to the SPIRITS client
        on the initiative system.

    5. The 'thin'  SPIRITS server applet  on the called  party's machine 
       receives  the invitation  request and  allows the user  to decide 
       how this call should be handled. Possible options here could be :

         a) Drop the Internet connection and take the call over the PSTN
            /IN system.

<draft-ietf-spirits-ccib-01.txt>  CCIB (PINT & SPIRITS)   December, 2000

         b) Accept the connection via a VoIP gateway in the PSTN/ IN.
         c) Pass the call on to a Voice Mail system.
         d) Play Announcements.
         e) Refuse the call.

    6. The called party's wishes are contained in this response which is
       passed back to the initiative system.

   Note!  Due to the fact that registration is issued by the subscriber,
   not hand  crafted or permanently  pinned-up by the service  provider,
   this  inherently  provides  the possibility  of service  mobility.  A 
   subscriber 'may' register themselves on any number. There are obvious
   security concerns with this and these are discussed in other sections
   of this Internet Draft.

6. Security Implications

   It is acknowledged that there are some serious  security implications
   which arise in consideration of such an implementation.  These issues
   are primarily related the registration and de-registration phases.

6.1. Registration

   A user may attempt to  Register for this  service on another's number 
   (by accident or design) in order to claim notification on a line they 
   have no right to.

   In a 'real world'  implementation of this service this security issue
   will need  to  be resolved.  As well as the use of standard  security
   mechanisms  such as passwords and keys,  more secure  implementations
   could undertake to : 

    1) Only allow this kind of access from the user's own phone. 

    2) Provide functionality to check the actual CLI from which the user 
       issued their Registration (as highlighted early). 

    3) Only provide two  possibilities on 'untrusted' (e.g. "roaming" or 
       "non home") numbers, that is drop the current Internet connection
       and establish a POTS call, or ignore the SPIRITS message. 

    4) Maintain good accounting in order to track offenders down.

6.2. De-registration

   The de-registration problem would arise if a user did not de-register
   themselves before  they finished  using the Internet.  This likely to
   be a common occurrence e.g.  users turning off their machines/ modems
   without de-registering. It is expected that any implementation should
   build in a mechanism to handle this scenario. Authenticators could be
   passed in responses to the  registration messages sent to the SPIRITS 
   service on the  user's machine.  Alternatively,  these authenticators 
   could be  placed directly  in the SPIRITS server when it is initially  
   downloaded. 

   When the user  logs off the  Internet, without de-registering,  there 
   are  three scenarios which could  happen when  an attempt is made  to 
   place a call to the number the user specified as their location :

     1) The line  is not busy,  therefore place the call and  remove any
        previously held registrations.


Buller                                                         [Page 11]

<draft-ietf-spirits-ccib-01.txt>  CCIB (PINT & SPIRITS)   December, 2000

     2) The line  is busy on a voice call.  An attempt to send a  INVITE
        message fails  (as there would be no  receiving SPIRITS server).  
        Any previously held  registration for this number could  then be
        removed.

     3) Another user (or the same user on a different  Internet session)
        has registered  for receipt of  calls on this number.  There are 
        two solution possibilities :
 
          a) When  the  new  registration is  made the  old  is replaced 
             immediately.

        or

          b) The new  registration is kept until an  Authenticator fails
             on the SPIRITS server of the  new  registrand  when a  call 
             attempt is made.  When  the Authenticator  fails the INVITE  
             fails and  the  original  registration can  be removed  and 
             replaced with the new. The INVITE is then resent to the new 
             registrand.

7. Conclusions

   This Internet Draft has initially provided an overview description of
   how the PINT and SPIRITS paradigms differ. However, it has also shown
   how they may be used together in the provision of services. 

   Various required entities,  mechanisms and their location required in 
   the provision of an ICW/ CCIB service have also been discussed.

   This Internet draft has detailed an implementation of CCIB which uses 
   PINT and SPIRITS 'like' functionality in provision  of two aspects of 
   the one service.
