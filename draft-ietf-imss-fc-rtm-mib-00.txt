Internet Draft         FC Routing Information MIB            August 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to the Fibre Channel network's Routing Table for routing within a
   Fabric.  Managed objects specific to particular routing protocols,
   such as FSPF, are not specified in this MIB module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A

Internet Draft         FC Routing Information MIB            August 2005


   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an
   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers which
   identify the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
   both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the
   FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
   Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address
   hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   The routing of frames within the Fabric is normally based on the
   standard routing protocol, called the Fabric Shortest Path First
   (FSPF) protocol.  The operation of FSPF (or any other routing
   protocol) allows a switch to generate and maintain its own routing
   table of how to forward frames it receives, i.e., a table in which to
   lookup the destination address of a received frame in order to
   determine the best link by which to forward that frame towards its
   destination.


4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focussed
   on Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT] which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB for Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the routing of traffic
   within a Fabric of a Fibre Channel network.  The standard routing
   protocol for Fibre Channel is FSPF [FC-SW-4].  Another MIB [FC-FSM-
   MIB] specifies management information specific to FSPF.  This MIB
   contains routing information which is independent of FSPF (i.e., it
   would still apply even if a routing protocol other than FSPF were in
   use in the network).

   This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-MIB,

Internet Draft         FC Routing Information MIB            August 2005


   defined in [FC-FAM-MIB].


5.  MIB Overview

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of,
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of the FSPF
   protocol.  (Note that there are no definitions in this MIB module of
   "managed actions" which can be invoked via SNMP.)

5.1.  Fibre Channel management instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [FC-MGMT] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411] section
   3.3.1).

5.2.  Switch Index

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [FC-MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches which are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

5.3.  Fabric Index

   The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple
   Fabric Switch elements is [FC-SW-4] (which replaces the previous
   revision [FC-SW-3]).  [FC-SW-4] specifies the operation of both a
   single Fabric in a physical infrastructure, as well as the support of
   multiple Virtual Fabrics operating within one (or more) physical
   infrastructures.  Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e.,
   without Virtual Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of

Internet Draft         FC Routing Information MIB            August 2005


   FSPF within a Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB defines all
   Fabric-related information in tables which are INDEX-ed by an
   arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index", the syntax of which is
   IMPORTed from the T11-TC-MIB.  When a device is connected to a single
   physical Fabric, without use of any virtual Fabrics, the value of
   this Fabric Index will always be 1.  In an environment of multiple
   virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this index provides a means to
   distinguish one Fabric from another.

   It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel
   switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical
   Fabrics.  Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query
   concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected,
   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FcRouteFabricIndex when they
   both appear in the same INDEX clause.

5.4.  The t11FcRouteGroup Group

   This MIB contains one object group, the t11FcRouteGroup.  This group
   contains objects to allow the displaying and the configuring of
   routes in the Fibre Channel Routing tables for the locally-managed
   switches.

           Such routes are used by a switch to forward frames (of user
           data) on a Fabric.  The conceptual process is based on
           extracting the Destination Fibre Channel Addresss Identifier

           it to each entry of this table which is applicable to the

   the appropriate subtree.

12.  Security Considerations

   There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability are:

        t11FcRouteDomainId, t11FcRouteMetric, t11FcRouteType,
        t11FcRouteIfDown, t11FcRouteRowStatus
           -- configure new routes and/or modify existing routes.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  For example, the ability to change network
   topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to
   obtain better performance at the expense of other network users.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  The objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability are: the write-able objects listed above
   plus one other:

        t11FcRouteLastChangeTime
           -- the time of the last routing table change.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

Internet Draft         FC Routing Information MIB            August 2005


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
