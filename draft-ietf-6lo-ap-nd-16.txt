 Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy Networks
                        draft-ietf-6lo-ap-nd-16

Abstract

   This document updates the 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
   defined in RFC 6775 and RFC 8505.  The new extension is called
   Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) and it protects the
   owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks
   in a low-power and lossy network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this
   extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID) and use it
   with one or more of their Registered Addresses.  The Crypto-ID
   identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to
   provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once an
   address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership is
   provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration
   information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.

1.  Introduction

   Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks [RFC6775]
   (6LoWPAN ND) adapts the original IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND)
   protocols defined in [RFC4861] and [RFC4862] for constrained low-
   power and lossy network (LLN).  In particular, 6LoWPAN ND introduces
   a unicast host Address Registration mechanism that reduces the use of
   multicast compared to the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) mechanism
   defined in IPv6 ND.  6LoWPAN ND defines a new Address Registration
   Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast Neighbor Solicitation
   (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages exchanged between a
   6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR).  It also defines the
   Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate Address Confirmation
   (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR).
   In LLN networks, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the
   registered addresses in its domain.

   The registration mechanism in "Neighbor Discovery Optimization for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks" [RFC6775] (aka 6LoWPAN ND) prevents the
   use of an address if that address is already registered in the subnet
   (first come first serve).  In order to validate address ownership,
   the registration mechanism enables the 6LR and 6LBR to validate the
   association between the registered address of a node, and its
   Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR).  The ROVR is defined in
   "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery" [RFC8505]
   and it can be derived from the MAC address of the device (using the
   64-bit Extended Unique Identifier EUI-64 address format specified by
   IEEE).  However, the EUI-64 can be spoofed, and therefore, any node
   connected to the subnet and aware of a registered-address-to-ROVR
   mapping could effectively fake the ROVR.  This would allow the an
   attacker to steal the address and redirect traffic for that address.
   [RFC8505] defines an Extended Address Registration Option (EARO)
   option that allows to transport alternate forms of ROVRs, and is a
   pre-requisite for this specification.

   In this specification, a 6LN generates a cryptographic ID (Crypto-ID)
   and places it in the ROVR field during the registration of one (or
   more) of its addresses with the 6LR(s).  Proof of ownership of the
   Crypto-ID is passed with the first registration exchange to a new
   6LR, and enforced at the 6LR.  The 6LR validates ownership of the
   cryptographic ID before it creates any new registration state, or
   changes existing information.

   The protected address registration protocol proposed in this document
   provides the same conceptual benefit as Source Address Validation
   (SAVI) [RFC7039] that only the owner of an IPv6 address may source
   packets with that address.  As opposed to [RFC7039], which relies on
   snooping protocols, the protection is based on a state that is
   installed and maintained in the network by the owner of the address.
   With this specification, a 6LN may use a 6LR for forwarding an IPv6
   packets if and only if it has registered the address used as source
   of the packet with that 6LR.

   The 6lo adaptation layer in [RFC4944] and [RFC6282] requires a device
   to form its IPv6 addresses based on its Layer-2 address to enable a
   better compression.  As a side note, this is incompatible with Secure
   Neighbor Discovery (SeND) [RFC3971] and Cryptographically Generated
   Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972], since they derive the Interface ID (IID)
   in IPv6 addresses from cryptographic keys.

2.3.  Additional References

   The reader may get additional context for this specification from the
   following references:

   *  "SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)" [RFC3971],

   *  "Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA)" [RFC3972],

   *  "Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6" [RFC4861] ,

   *  "IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration" [RFC4862], and

   *  "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs):
      Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals " [RFC4919].

3.  Updating RFC 8505

   Section 5.3 of [RFC8505] introduces the ROVR as a generic object that
   is designed for backward compatibility with the capability to
   introduce new computation methods in the future.  Section 7.3
   discusses collisions when heterogeneous methods to compute the ROVR
   field coexist inside a same network.

   [RFC8505] was designed in preparation for this specification, which
   is the RECOMMENDED method for building a ROVR field.

   This specification introduces a new token called a cryptographic
   identifier (Crypto-ID) that is transported in the ROVR field and used
   to prove indirectly the ownership of an address that is being
   registered by means of [RFC8505].  The Crypto-ID is derived from a
   cryptographic public key and additional parameters.

   The overall mechanism requires the support of Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography (ECC) and of a hash function as detailed in Section 6.2.
   To enable the verification of the proof, the registering node needs
   to supply certain parameters including a Nonce and a signature that
   will demonstrate that the node possesses the private-key
   corresponding to the public-key used to build the Crypto-ID.

   The elliptic curves and the hash functions that can be used with this
   specification are listed in Table 2 in Section 8.3.  The signature
   scheme that specifies which combination is used is signaled by a
   Crypto-Type (values to be confirmed by IANA) in a new IPv6 ND Crypto-
   ID Parameters Option (CIPO, see Section 4.3) that contains the
   parameters that are necessary for the proof, a Nonce option
   ([RFC3971]) and a NDP Signature option (Section 4.4).  The NA(EARO)
   is modified to enable a challenge and transport a Nonce option.

4.  New Fields and Options

4.1.  New Crypto-ID

   The Crypto-ID is transported in the ROVR field of the EARO option and
   the EDAR message, and is associated with the Registered Address at
   the 6LR and the 6LBR.  The ownership of a Crypto-ID can be
   demonstrated by cryptographic mechanisms, and by association, the
   ownership of the Registered Address can be acertained.

   A node in possession of the necessary cryptographic primitives SHOULD
   use Crypto-ID by default as ROVR in its registrations.  Whether a
   ROVR is a Crypto-ID is indicated by a new "C" flag in the NS(EARO)
   message.

   The Crypto-ID is derived from the public key and a modifier as
   follows:

   1.  The hash function indicated by the Crypto-Type is applied to the
       CIPO.  Note that all the reserved and padding bits MUST be set to
       zero.
   2.  The leftmost bits of the resulting hash, up to the desired size,
       are used as the Crypto-ID.

   At the time of this writing, a minimal size for the Crypto-ID of 128
   bits is RECOMMENDED.  This value is bound to augment in the future.

4.2.  Updated EARO

   This specification updates the EARO option to enable the use of the
   ROVR field to transport the Crypto-ID.

   The resulting format is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      Crypto-ID and that the 6LN MAY be challenged for ownership as
      specified in this document.

   TID:  Defined in [RFC8505].

   Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR):  When the "C" flag is set,
      this field contains a Crypto-ID.

   This specification uses Status values "Validation Requested" and
   "Validation Failed", which are defined in [RFC8505].

   this specification does not define any new Status value.

4.3.  Crypto-ID Parameters Option

   This specification defines the Crypto-ID Parameters Option (CIPO).
   The CIPO carries the parameters used to form a Crypto-ID.

   In order to provide cryptographic agility [RFC7696], this
   specification supports different elliptic curves, indicated by a
   Crypto-Type field:

   *  NIST P-256 [FIPS186-4] MUST be supported by all implementations.

   *  The Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) curve
      Ed25519 (PureEdDSA) [RFC8032] MAY be supported as an alternate.

   *  This specification uses signature schemes which target similar
      cryptographic strength but rely on different curves, hash
      functions, signature algorithms, and/or representation
      conventions.  Future specification may extend this for different
      cryptographic algorithms and longer keys, e.g., to provide a
      better security properties or a simpler implementation.

   Public Key:  A variable-length field, size indicated in the Public
      Key Length field.  JWK-Encoded Public Key [RFC7517].

      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.


   The implementation of multiple hash functions in a constrained
   devices may consume excessive amounts of program memory.  This
   specification enables the use of SHA-256 [RFC6234] for all the
   supported ECC curves.

   Some code factorization is also possible for the ECC computation
   itself.  [CURVE-REPRESENTATIONS] provides information on how to
   represent Montgomery curves and (twisted) Edwards curves as curves in
   short-Weierstrass form and illustrates how this can be used to
   implement elliptic curve computations using existing implementations
   that already provide, e.g., ECDSA and ECDH using NIST [FIPS186-4]
   prime curves.

   For more details on representation conventions, we refer to
   Appendix B.

4.4.  NDP Signature Option

   This specification defines the NDP Signature Option (NDPSO).  The
   NDPSO carries the signature that proves the ownership of the Crypto-
   ID.

   The format of the NDP Signature Option (NDPSO) is illustrated in
   Figure 3.

   As opposed to the RSA Signature Option (RSAO) defined in section 5.2.
   of SEND [RFC3971], the NDPSO does not have a key hash field.
   Instead, the leftmost 128 bits of the ROVR field in the EARO are used
   to retrieve the CIPO that contains the key material used for
   signature verification, left-padded if needed.

   Another difference is that the NDPSO signs a fixed set of fields as
   opposed to all options that appear prior to it in the that bears the
   signature.  This allows to elide a CIPO that the 6LR already
   received, at the expense of the capability to add arbitrary options
   that would signed with a RSAO.

   The CIPO may be present in the same message as the NDPSO.  If not, it
   can be found in an abstract table that was created by a previous
   message and indexed by the hash.

5.  Protocol Scope

   The scope of the protocol specified here is a 6LoWPAN LLN, typically
   a stub network connected to a larger IP network via a Border Router
   called a 6LBR per [RFC6775].  A 6LBR has sufficient capability to
   satisfy the needs of duplicate address detection.

   The 6LBR maintains registration state for all devices in its attached
   LLN.  Together with the first-hop router (the 6LR), the 6LBR assures
   uniqueness and grants ownership of an IPv6 address before it can be
   used in the LLN.  This is in contrast to a traditional network that
   relies on IPv6 address auto-configuration [RFC4862], where there is
   no guarantee of ownership from the network, and each IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery packet must be individually secured [RFC3971].

                       Figure 4: Basic Configuration

   In a mesh network, the 6LR is directly connected to the host device.
   This specification mandates that the peer-wise layer-2 security is
   deployed so that all the packets from a particular host are securely
   identifiable by the 6LR.  The 6LR may be multiple hops away from the
   6LBR.  Packets are routed between the 6LR and the 6LBR via other
   6LRs.  This specification mandates that a chain of trust is
   established so that a packet that was validated by the first 6LR can
   be safely routed by other on-path 6LRs to the 6LBR.

6.  Protocol Flows

   The 6LR/6LBR ensures first-come/first-serve by storing the ROVR
   associated to the address being registered upon the first
   registration and rejecting a registration with a different ROVR
   value.  A 6LN can claim any address as long as it is the first to
   make that claim.  After a successful registration, the 6LN becomes
   the owner of the registered address and the address is bound to the
   ROVR value in the 6LR/6LBR registry.



Thubert, et al.           Expires 6 August 2020                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        Address Protection ND for LLN        February 2020


   This specification enables the 6LR to challenge the 6LN to verify its
   ownership of the binding by placing a Crypto-ID in the ROVR.  The
   challenge can happen at any time at the discretion of the 6LR.  The
   6LR MUST challenge the 6LN when it creates a binding and when a new
   registration attempts to change a parameter of the binding that
   identifies the 6LN, for instance its Source Link-Layer Address.  The
   verification protects against a rogue that would steal an address and
   attract its traffic, or use it as source address.

   The challenge can also triggered by the 6LBR, e.g., to enforce a
   global policy.  In that case, the 6LBR returns a status of
   "Validation Requested" in the DAR/DAC exchange, which is echoed by
   the 6LR in the NA (EARO) back to the registering node.  A valid
   registration in the 6LR or the 6LBR MUST NOT be altered until the
   challenge is complete.

   A node may use more than one IPv6 address at the same time.  The
   separation of the address and the cryptographic material avoids
   avoids the need for the constrained device to compute multiple keys
   for multiple addresses.  The 6LN MAY use the same Crypto-ID to prove
   the ownership of multiple IPv6 addresses.  The 6LN MAY also derive
   multiple Crypto-IDs from a same key.

6.1.  First Exchange with a 6LR

   A 6LN registers to a 6LR that is one hop away from it with the "C"
   flag set in the EARO, indicating that the ROVR field contains a
   Crypto-ID.  The Target Address in the NS message indicates the IPv6
   address that the 6LN is trying to register [RFC8505].  The on-link
   (local) protocol interactions are shown in Figure 5.  If the 6LR does
   not have a state with the 6LN that is consistent with the NS(EARO),
   then it replies with a challenge NA (EARO, status=Validation
   Requested) that contains a Nonce Option (shown as NonceLR in
   Figure 5).

   The Nonce option contains a Nonce value that, to the extent possible
   for the implementation, was never employed in association with the
   key pair used to generate the Crypto-ID.  This specification inherits
   from [RFC3971] that simply indicates that the nonce is a random
   value.  Ideally, an implementation uses an unpredictable
   cryptographically random value [RFC4086].  But that may be
   impractical in some LLN scenarios where the devices do not have a
   guaranteed sense of time and for which computing complex hashes is
   detrimental to the battery lifetime.  Alternatively, the device may
   use an always-incrementing value saved in the same stable storage as
   the key, so they are lost together, and starting at a best effort
   random value, either as the Nonce value or as a component to its
   computation.

Internet-Draft        Address Protection ND for LLN        February 2020


   The 6LN replies to the challenge with an NS(EARO) that includes a new
   Nonce option (shown as NonceLN in Figure 5), the CIPO (Section 4.3),
   and the NDPSO containing the signature.  Both Nonces are included in
   the signed material.  This provides a "contributory behavior", so
   that either party that knows it generates a good quality Nonce knows
   that the protocol will be secure.

   The 6LR MUST store the information associated to a Crypto-ID on the
   first NS exchange where it appears in a fashion that the CIPO
   parameters can be retrieved from the Crypto-ID alone.

                    Figure 5: On-link Protocol Operation

   The steps for the registration to the 6LR are as follows:

   *  Upon the first exchange with a 6LR, a 6LN will be challenged to
      prove ownership of the Crypto-ID and the Target Address being
      registered in the Neighbor Solicitation message.  When a 6LR
      receives a NS(EARO) registration with a new Crypto-ID as a ROVR,
      and unless the registration is rejected for another reason, it
      MUST challenge by responding with a NA(EARO) with a status of
      "Validation Requested".

Internet-Draft        Address Protection ND for LLN        February 2020


   *  Upon receiving a first NA(EARO) with a status of "Validation
      Requested" from a 6LR, the registering node SHOULD retry its
      registration with a Crypto-ID Parameters Option (CIPO)
      (Section 4.3) that contains all the necessary material for
      building the Crypto-ID, the NonceLN that it generated, and the NDP
      signature (Section 4.4) option that proves its ownership of the
      Crypto-ID and intent of registering the Target Address.  In
      subsequent revalidation with the same 6LR, the 6LN MAY try to omit
      the CIPO to save bandwidth, with the expectation that the 6LR
      saved it.  If the validation fails and it gets challenged again,
      then it SHOULD add the CIPO again.

   *  In order to validate the ownership, the 6LR performs the same
      steps as the 6LN and rebuilds the Crypto-ID based on the
      parameters in the CIPO.  If the rebuilt Crypto-ID matches the
      ROVR, the 6LN also verifies the signature contained in the NDPSO
      option.  If at that point the signature in the NDPSO option can be
      verified, then the validation succeeds.  Otherwise the validation
      fails.

   *  If the 6LR fails to validate the signed NS(EARO), it responds with
      a status of "Validation Failed".  After receiving a NA(EARO) with
      a status of "Validation Failed", the registering node SHOULD try
      to register an alternate target address in the NS message.


6.2.  NDPSO generation and verification

   The signature generated by the 6LN to provide proof-of-ownership of
   the private-key is carried in the NDP Signature Option (NDPSO).  It
   is generated by the 6LN in a fashion that depends on the Crypto-Type
   (see Table 2 in Section 8.3) chosen by the 6LN as follows:

   *  Concatenate the following in the order listed:

   1.  The 128-bit Message Type tag [RFC3972] (in network byte order).
       For this specification the tag is 0x8701 55c8 0cca dd32 6ab7 e415
       f148 84d0.  (The tag value has been generated by the editor of
       this specification on random.org).
   2.  JWK-encoded public key
   3.  the 16-byte Target Address (in network byte order) sent in the
       Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message.  It is the address which the
       6LN is registering with the 6LR and 6LBR.
   4.  NonceLR received from the 6LR (in network byte order) in the
       Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message.  The Nonce is at least 6
       bytes long as defined in [RFC3971].
   5.  NonceLN sent from the 6LN (in network byte order).  The Nonce is
       at least 6 bytes long as defined in [RFC3971].

Internet-Draft        Address Protection ND for LLN        February 2020


   6.  The length of the ROVR field containing the Crypto-ID.
   7.  1-byte Crypto-Type value sent in the CIPO option.

   *  Apply the hash function (if any) specified by the Crypto-Type to
      the concatenated data, e.g., hash the resulting data using SHA-
      256.

   *  Apply the signature algorithm specified by the Crypto-Type, e.g.,
      sign the hash output with ECDSA (if curve P-256 is used) or sign
      the hash with EdDSA (if curve Ed25519 (PureEdDSA)).

   The 6LR on receiving the NDPSO and CIPO options first regenerates the
   Crypto-ID based on the CIPO option to make sure that the leftmost
   bits up to the size of the ROVR match.  If and only if the check is
   successful, it tries to verify the signature in the NDPSO option
   using the following:

   *  Concatenate the following in the order listed:

   1.  128-bit type tag (in network byte order)
   2.  JWK-encoded public key received in the CIPO option
   3.  the 16-byte Target Address (in network byte order) received in
       the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message.  It is the address which
       the 6LN is registering with the 6LR and 6LBR.
   4.  NonceLR sent in the Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message.  The
       Nonce is at least 6 bytes long as defined in [RFC3971].
   5.  NonceLN received from the 6LN (in network byte order) in the NS
       message.  The Nonce is at least 6 bytes long as defined in
       [RFC3971].
   6.  The length of the ROVR field in the NS message containing the
       Crypto-ID that was received.
   7.  1-byte Crypto-Type value received in the CIPO option.

   *  Apply the hash function (if any) specified by the Crypto-Type
      indicated by the 6LN in the CIPO to the concatenated data.

   *  Verify the signature with the public-key in the CIPO and the
      locally computed values using the signature algorithm specified by
      the Crypto-Type.  If the verification succeeds, the 6LR propagates
      the information to the 6LBR using a EDAR/EDAC flow.  Due to the
      first-come/first-serve nature of the registration, if the address
      is not registered to the 6LBR, then flow succeeds and both the 6LR
      and 6LBR add the state information about the Crypto-ID and Target
      Address being registered to their respective abstract database.

6.3.  Multihop Operation

   A new 6LN that joins the network auto-configures an address and
   performs an initial registration to a neighboring 6LR with an NS
   message that carries an Address Registration Option (EARO) [RFC8505].

   In a multihop 6LoWPAN, the registration with Crypto-ID is propagated
   to 6LBR as shown in Figure 6, which illustrates the registration flow
   all the way to a 6LowPAN Backbone Router (6BBR) [BACKBONE-ROUTER].

   The 6LR and the 6LBR communicate using ICMPv6 Extended Duplicate
   Address Request (EDAR) and Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation
   (EDAC) messages [RFC8505] as shown in Figure 6.  This specification
   extends EDAR/EDAC messages to carry cryptographically generated ROVR.

   The assumption is that the 6LR and the 6LBR maintain a security
   association, so there is no need to propagate the proof of ownership
   to the 6LBR.  The 6LBR implicitly trusts that the 6LR performs the
   verification when the 6LBR requires it, and if there is no further
   exchange from the 6LR to remove the state, that the verification
   succeeded.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Inheriting from RFC 3971

   Observations regarding the following threats to the local network in
   [RFC3971] also apply to this specification.

   Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement Spoofing:  Threats in section
      9.2.1 of RFC3971 apply.  AP-ND counters the threats on NS(EARO)
      messages by requiring that the NDP Signature and CIPO options be
      present in these solicitations.

   Duplicate Address Detection DoS Attack:  Inside the LLN, Duplicate
      Addresses are sorted out using the ROVR, which differentiates it
      from a movement.  A different ROVR for the same Registered address
      entails a rejection of the second registration [RFC8505].  DAD
      coming from the backbone are not forwarded over the LLN, which
      provides some protection against DoS attacks inside the resource-
      constrained part of the network.  Over the backbone, the EARO
      option is present in NS/NA messages.  This protects against
      misinterpreting a movement for a duplication, and enables the
      backbone routers to determine which one has the freshest
      registration [RFC8505] and is thus the best candidate to validate
      the registration for the device attached to it [BACKBONE-ROUTER].
      But this specification does not guarantee that the backbone router
      claiming an address over the backbone is not an attacker.

   Router Solicitation and Advertisement Attacks:  This specification
      does not change the protection of RS and RA which can still be
      protected by SEND.

   Replay Attacks  Using Nonces (NonceLR and NonceLN) generated by both
      the 6LR and 6LN ensure a contributory behavior that provides an
      efficient protection against replay attacks of the challenge/
      response flow.  A nonce should never repeat for a same key.  The
      protection depends on the quality of the Nonce computation, e.g.,
      of a random number generator when used to compute the Nonce.

   Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack:  A rogue node that managed to access
      the L2 network may form many addresses and register them using AP-
      ND.  The perimeter of the attack is all the 6LRs in range of the
      attacker.  The 6LR MUST protect itself against overflows and
      reject excessive registration with a status 2 "Neighbor Cache
      Full".  This effectively blocks another (honest) 6LN from
      registering to the same 6LR, but the 6LN may register to other
      6LRs that are in its range but not in that of the rogue.

7.2.  Related to 6LoWPAN ND

   The threats and mediations discussed in 6LoWPAN ND [RFC6775][RFC8505]
   also apply here, in particular denial-of-service attacks against the
   registry at the 6LR or 6LBR.

   Secure ND [RFC3971] forces the IPv6 address to be cryptographic since
   it integrates the CGA as the IID in the IPv6 address.  In contrast,
   this specification saves about 1Kbyte in every NS/NA message.  Also,
   this specification separates the cryptographic identifier from the
   registered IPv6 address so that a node can have more than one IPv6
   address protected by the same cryptographic identifier.

   With this specification the 6LN can freely form its IPv6 address(es)
   in any fashion, thereby enabling either 6LoWPAN compression for IPv6
   addresses that are derived from Layer-2 addresses, or temporary
   addresses, e.g., formed pseudo-randomly and released in relatively
   short cycles for privacy reasons [RFC8064][RFC8065], that cannot be
   compressed.

   This specification provides added protection for addresses that are
   obtained following due procedure [RFC8505] but does not constrain the
   way the addresses are formed or the number of addresses that are used
   in parallel by a same entity.  A rogue may still perform denial-of-
   service attack against the registry at the 6LR or 6LBR, or attempt to
   deplete the pool of available addresses at Layer-2 or Layer-3.

7.3.  ROVR Collisions

   A collision of Registration Ownership Verifiers (ROVR) (i.e., the
   Crypto-ID in this specification) is possible, but it is a rare event.
   Assuming in the calculations/discussion below that the hash used for
   calculating the Crypto-ID is a well-behaved cryptographic hash and
   thus that random collisions are the only ones possible, the formula
   (birthday paradox) for calculating the probability of a collision is
   1 - e^{-k^2/(2n)} where n is the maximum population size (2^64 here,
   1.84E19) and k is the actual population (number of nodes, assuming
   one Crypto-ID per node).

   If the Crypto-ID is 64-bits (the least possible size allowed), the
   chance of a collision is 0.01% for network of 66 million nodes.
   Moreover, the collision is only relevant when this happens within one
   stub network (6LBR).  In the case of such a collision, a third party
   node would be able to claim the registered address of an another
   legitimate node, provided that it wishes to use the same address.  To
   prevent address disclosure and avoid the chances of collision on both
   the RIVR and the address, it is RECOMMENDED that nodes do not derive
   the address being registered from the ROVR.

7.4.  Implementation Attacks

   The signature schemes referenced in this specification comply with
   NIST [FIPS186-4] or Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) standards
   [RFC8032] and offer strong algorithmic security at roughly 128-bit
   security level.  These signature schemes use elliptic curves that
   were either specifically designed with exception-free and constant-
   time arithmetic in mind [BCP 201] or where one has extensive
   implementation experience of resistance to timing attacks
   [FIPS186-4].  However, careless implementations of the signing
   operations could nevertheless leak information on private keys.  For
   example, there are micro-architectural side channel attacks that
   implementors should be aware of [breaking-ed25519].  Implementors
   should be particularly aware that a secure implementation of Ed25519
   requires a protected implementation of the hash function SHA-512,
   whereas this is not required with implementations of SHA-256 used
   with ECDSA.

7.5.  Cross-Algorithm and Cross-Protocol Attacks

   The keypair used in this specification can be self-generated and the
   public key does not need to be exchanged, e.g., through certificates,
   with a third party before it is used.  New keypairs can be formed for
   new registration as the node desires.  On the other hand, it is safer
   to allocate a keypair that is used only for the address protection
   and only for one signature scheme.  The same private key MUST NOT be
   reused with more than one signature scheme in this specification.
   The same private key MUST NOT be used for anything other than
   computing NDPSO signatures per this specification.

7.6.  Compromised 6LR

   This specification distributes the challenge and its validation at
   the edge of the network, between the 6LN and its 6LR.  This protects
   against DOS attacks targeted at that central 6LBR.  This also saves
   back and forth exchanges across a potentially large and constrained
   network.  The downside is that the 6LBR needs to trust the 6LR for
   performing the checking adequately, and the communication between the
   6LR and the 6LBR must be protected to avoid tempering with the result
   of the test.

   If a 6LR is compromised, and provided that it knows the ROVR field
   used by the real owner of the address, the 6LR may pretend that the
   owner has moved, is now attached to it and has successfully passed
   the Crpto-ID validation.  The 6LR may then attract and inject traffic
   at will on behalf of that address.  Similarly, the 6LR may admit any
   rogue and let it take ownership of any address in the network for
   which it knows the value of ROVR.

Appendix A.  Requirements Addressed in this Document

   In this section we state requirements of a secure neighbor discovery
   protocol for low-power and lossy networks.

   *  The protocol MUST be based on the Neighbor Discovery Optimization
      for Low-power and Lossy Networks protocol defined in [RFC6775].

Internet-Draft        Address Protection ND for LLN        February 2020


      RFC6775 utilizes optimizations such as host-initiated interactions
      for sleeping resource-constrained hosts and elimination of
      multicast address resolution.
   *  New options to be added to Neighbor Solicitation messages MUST
      lead to small packet sizes, especially compared with existing
      protocols such as SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND).  Smaller
      packet sizes facilitate low-power transmission by resource-
      constrained nodes on lossy links.
   *  The support for this registration mechanism SHOULD be extensible
      to more LLN links than IEEE 802.15.4 only.  Support for at least
      the LLN links for which a 6lo "IPv6 over foo" specification
      exists, as well as Low-Power Wi-Fi SHOULD be possible.
   *  As part of this extension, a mechanism to compute a unique
      Identifier should be provided with the capability to form a Link
      Local Address that SHOULD be unique at least within the LLN
      connected to a 6LBR.
   *  The Address Registration Option used in the ND registration SHOULD
      be extended to carry the relevant forms of Unique Interface
      Identifier.
   *  The Neighbor Discovery should specify the formation of a site-
      local address that follows the security recommendations from
      [RFC7217].


Appendix B.  Representation Conventions

B.1.  Signature Schemes

   The signature scheme ECDSA256 corresponding to Crypto-Type 0 is
   ECDSA, as specified in [FIPS186-4], instantiated with the NIST prime
   curve P-256, as specified in Appendix B of [FIPS186-4], and the hash
   function SHA-256, as specified in [RFC6234], where points of this
   NIST curve are represented as points of a short-Weierstrass curve
   (see [FIPS186-4]) and are encoded as octet strings in most-
   significant-bit first (msb) and most-significant-byte first (MSB)
   order.  The signature itself consists of two integers (r and s),
   which are each encoded as fixed-size octet strings in most-
   significant-bit first and most-significant-byte first order.  For
   details on ECDSA, see [FIPS186-4]; for details on the integer
   encoding, see Appendix B.2.

   The signature scheme Ed25519 corresponding to Crypto-Type 1 is EdDSA,
   as specified in [RFC8032], instantiated with the Montgomery curve
   Curve25519, as specified in [BCP 201], and the hash function SHA-512,
   as specified in [RFC6234], where points of this Montgomery curve are
   represented as points of the corresponding twisted Edwards curve (see
   Appendix B.3) and are encoded as octet strings in least-significant-
   bit first (lsb) and least-significant-byte first (LSB) order.  The

   signature itself consists of a bit string that encodes a point of
   this twisted Edwards curve, in compressed format, and an integer
   encoded in least-significant-bit first and least-significant-byte
   first order.  For details on EdDSA and on the encoding conversions,
   see the specification of pure Ed25519 in . [RFC8032]

   The signature scheme ECDSA25519 corresponding to Crypto-Type 2 is
   ECDSA, as specified in [FIPS186-4], instantiated with the Montgomery
   curve Curve25519, as specified in [BCP 201], and the hash function
   SHA-256, as specified in [RFC6234], where points of this Montgomery
   curve are represented as points of a corresponding curve in short-
   Weierstrass form (see Appendix B.3) and are encoded as octet strings
   in most-significant-bit first and most-significant-byte first order.
   The signature itself consists of a bit string that encodes two
   integers, each encoded as fixed-size octet strings in most-
   significant-bit first and most-significant-byte first order.  For
   details on ECDSA, see [FIPS186-4]; for details on the integer
   encoding, see Appendix B.2

B.2.  Integer Representation for ECDSA signatures

   With ECDSA, each signature is a pair (r, s) of integers [FIPS186-4].
   Each integer is encoded as a fixed-size 256-bit bit string, where
   each integer is represented according to the Field Element to Octet
   String and Octet String to Bit String conversion rules in [SEC1] and
   where the ordered pair of integers is represented as the
   rightconcatenation of the resulting representation values.  The
   inverse operation follows the corresponding Bit String to Octet
   String and Octet String to Field Element conversion rules of [SEC1].

B.3.  Alternative Representations of Curve25519

   The elliptic curve Curve25519, as specified in [BCP 201], is a so-
   called Montgomery curve.  Each point of this curve can also be
   represented as a point of a twisted Edwards curve or as a point of an
   elliptic curve in short-Weierstrass form, via a coordinate
   transformation (a so-called isomorphic mapping).  The parameters of
   the Montgomery curve and the corresponding isomorphic curves in
   twisted Edwards curve and short-Weierstrass form are as indicated
   below.  Here, the domain parameters of the Montgomery curve
   Curve25519 and of the twisted Edwards curve Edwards25519 are as
   specified in [BCP 201]; the domain parameters of the elliptic curve
   Wei25519 in short-Weierstrass curve comply with Section 6.1.1 of
   [FIPS186-4].  For details of the coordinate transformation referenced
   above, see [BCP 201] and [CURVE-REPRESENTATIONS].
