     1. Abstract 
         
        This document lists the various VPIM email addresses that are currently 
        in common use and defines several new address formats for special case 
        usage.  
         
         
         
     2. Conventions used in this document 
         
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
         
         
     3. Introduction  
                
        [VPIM2] does not place any restrictions on the email address format. 
        However, it does RECOMMEND to use a numeric LHS since many legacy voice 
        mail systems only use digits to identify mailboxes. Further, it 
        RECOMMENDS a structure to handle private, international and extensions. 
        The private format has become deployed in most existing VPIM v2 
        systems, further some systems will only accept messages from addresses 
        with a numeric LHS.  
         
        [IVM] does not describe addressing at all. The LHS format is left to 
        the discretion of the mailbox owner. However, it is useful in some 
        cases (like submission or tunneling) to specify a LHS format. A format 
        based on GSTN addressing [GSTN] is presented.  
         
        This document defines the various recipient (i.e., TO) addresses for 
        VPIM and IVM messages. 
         
         
     4. VPIM v2 Addressing 
         
        This is defined in section 4.1.1 of [VPIM2] & [VPIMV2R2].  Of the four 
        groups of addresses defined, the mailbox number format is the most 
        commonly used in VPIM v2 systems.   
         
                    Example:  6137637582@nortelnetworks.com

     5. VPIM Addressing 
      
        VPIM places no restrictions on the form of the Internet address. VPIM 
        systems must be capable of receiving an arbitrary email address and 
        generating a reply to that address. No inferences about the structure 
        of the local part (LHS) should be necessary.  
                
        Recipients email addresses must be created in a form compatible with 
        the recipients system and consistent with the address entry 
        capabilities of a telephone user interface. 
         
        The following sections use formal syntax compliant with RFC 2234, 
        "Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF". 
         
                 
                
     5.1 VPIM Submission LHS   
                
        Limited capability voice mail machines may send messages by default to 
        an external message submission gateway.  These gateways will convert 
        the unresolved telephone number of the recipient into a legitimate 
        email address.  Messages requiring address resolution must be sent to a 
        submission system which will convert the submitted address into the 
        route-able email address.   
         
        Additionally, limited capability email systems may send messages to a 
        VPIM onramp system indicated on the RHS. The LHS would indicate that 
        the message is to be sent as a VPIM message to the telephone number 
        indicated. In this case, address and message translation is performed 
        by the gateway.  
                
        Telephone numbers sent in a VPIM submission mode MUST be sent in one of 
        the following forms.  
                
        This is based on the format defined in [GSTN-ADDR] and extensions in 
        [GSTN].  
         
                
     5.1.1 The VPIM address  
         
        For voice messages that are intended to be sent as VPIM messages the  
        service-selector element is defined to be: 
         
        vpim-service-selector = "VPIM"  
         
        The resultant vpim-address and vpim-mbox are formally  
                
        vpim-address = vpim-mbox  
                      [ pstn-recipient ]  
                
        vpim-mbox = [ "VPIM=" ] ( global-phone / local-phone )

                    [ sub-addr-spec ext-addr-spec dl-addr-spec]  
         
        dl-addr-spec = "/DL=" sub-addr  
                              ;note that "/DL=" is case INSENSITIVE              
        ext-addr-spec = [ ext-sep sub-addr ]  
        ext-sep = ( "/EXT=" / "+" )  
                              ; note that "/EXT=" is case INSENSITIVE  
                              ; "+" is used for compatibility with current  
                              ; VPIM v2 addressing  
                
        For clarity, here is an example of a very simple vpim-mbox:  
             VPIM=6137637582  
         
        The extension syntax, that is a phone number followed by "/EXT=" 
        defining the extension, would be used where the mailbox does not have a 
        direct dial number associated with it (e.g., typically behind a non-
        ISDN PBX).   For example: 
         
             VPIM=7035255550/EXT=227 
         
        The distribution list syntax, that is a phone number followed by "/DL=" 
        defining the list, would be used to refer to a distribution list 
        associated with the phone number (with or without an extension).  For 
        example: 
         
         
             VPIM=+14165977230/DL=93  
         
                
                
     5.1.2 The Voice address  
                
        For voice messages that are intended to be sent as a voice outdialing 
        at the destination system, the service-selector element is defined to 
        be:       
         
        voice-service-selector = "VOICE"  
                
        The resultant voice-address and voice-mbox are formally  
                
        voice-address = voice-mbox  
                       [ pstn-recipient ]  
                
        voice-mbox = "VOICE=" ( global-phone / local-phone )  
                           [ sub-addr spec ] [post-sep post-dial]  
                
        For more clarity, here is an example of a very simple voice-mbox:  
                
        VOICE=+3940226338

     5.1.3 The AMIS address  
                
        For voice messages that are intended to be sent as AMIS (Audio 
        Messaging Interchange Specification) voice mail messages, the service-
        selector element is defined to be:   
         
        amis-service-selector = "AMIS"  
                
        The resultant amis-address and amis-mbox are formally  
                
        amis-address = amis-mbox  
               
        amis-mbox = "AMIS=" amis-mailbox   
                    [ "/SYSNUM=" amis-sysnum ]  
                    ; note that "/SYSNUM=" is case INSENSITIVE  
                
        amis-mailbox = ( amis-a / amis-d )  
                
        amis-a = amis-a-number  
                
        amis-d = [ amis-mailbox-numberplan ][ "+" ] amis-mailbox-id   
                    [ "+" ] [ amis-mailbox-extension ]

        As defined in [FAX-ADDR],section 2. 
         
         
     5.2 VPIM Submission Addresses  
                   
        Based on RFC2303, these are the resultant email addresses for the LHS 
        presented above.  VPIM and IVM  systems that support submission MUST 
        accept, translate (if necessary), and forward messages sent to these 
        addresses.   
                     
                
     5.2.1 The vpim-email  
                    
        The vpim-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for VPIM 
        over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-selector 
        distinction is set to "VPIM". 
         
        vpim-email =  ["/"] vpim-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                     
        In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a VPIM capable   
        messaging system where the attached message will be delivered properly.  
                     
                
     5.2.2 The voice-email  
                    
        The voice-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the 
        voice outdialing over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the 
        service-selector distinction is set to "VOICE".  
         
        voice-email =  ["/"] voice-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                     
        In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that will 
        perform an outdial, that is for example, make a telephone call to the 
        specified number and play a voice attachment.

     5.2.3 The amis-email  
                
        The amis-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the AMIS 
        over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-selector 
        distinction is set to "AMIS".  
         
        amis-email =  ["/"] amis-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                     
        In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that acts as 
        a gateway to an AMIS network where the attached voice message will be 
        delivered properly.              
                
      
     5.2.4 The fax-email  
                     
        As defined in [FAX-ADDR], section 4. 
         
         
         
     6. Security Considerations 
      
        Most security considerations are already identified in [VPIM2] and 
        [IVM].  
         
        An additional concern would be that the sender must trust and also be 
        aware of the policies of the submission MTA to which the message is 
        submitted.  This is because, that MTA will make the determination of 
        where the final destination is and how it will be delivered based on 
        the VPIM submission LHS.  
         
        Submission MTAs should take care to not blindly place outdial calls to 
        any number submitted (e.g., international numbers or "1-900" numbers).  
        Ideally, senders should be authenticated to confirm their outdialing 
        privileges.
