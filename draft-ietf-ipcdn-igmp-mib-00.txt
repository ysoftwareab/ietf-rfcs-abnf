1. Abstract

   This memo defines a  portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects
   for SNMP-based management of DOCSIS 1.1 IGMPv2 compliant interfaces.
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to
   the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects are consistent with
   the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
   This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the
   Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should
   be addressed to the working group∆s mailing list at
   ipcdn@terayon.com and/or the author.

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

     oAn overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

     o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
       called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
       1904 [7].

     o Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
       protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
       called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
       The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
       described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

     o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
       and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

     o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
       [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB.


4. Glossary

   The following non-ietf terms, used in this document, are derived
   either from normal cable system usage, or from the documents
   associated with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification
   process.

   CATV - Originally 'Community Antenna Television', now used to refer
   to any cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video
   signals to a community.

   CM, Cable Modem - A CM acts as a 'slave' station in a DOCSIS
   compliant cable data system.

   CMTS, Cable Modem Termination System - A generic term covering a
   cable bridge or cable router in a head-end.  A CMTS acts as the
   master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.  It is the
   only station that transmits downstream, and it controls the
   scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated CMs.

   CPE, Customer Premise Equipment, non-Cable Modem IP Hosts attached
   to the Cable Modem.

   DOCSIS - 'Data Over Cable Interface Specification'.  A term
   referring to the ITU-T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem
   systems. [20]

   Downstream - From the head-end towards the subscriber.

   Head-end - The origination point in most cable systems of the
   subscriber video signals. Generally also the location of the CMTS
   equipment.

   MAC Packet - A DOCSIS PDU.

   RF - Radio Frequency.

   Upstream - From the subscriber towards the head-end.


5. Overview
   The Docsis Multicast CM and CMTS interconnect specification can be
   modelled by Êsplitting∆ the traditional Internet Group Management
   Protocol (IGMP), [ ], interfaces into Host and Querier side
   interfaces. That is, to provide basic Docsis 1.1 Multicast
   capabilities, all NSI-facing interfaces (NSI on the CMTS and HFC-
   side on CM) need only present an IGMP Host interface to the external
   multicast network. All CPE-facing interfaces (HFC-side on CMTS and
   CPE-side on CM) need only present a Querier interface to CPE. This
   is in comparison to a Multicast Router model where each interface
   has both Host and Querier capabilities. Although not strictly
   prohibited by the RFI, a more symmetrical model, where the root of a
   Multicast group may be on the HFC/CPE-side, is discouraged. Thus,
   Querying is almost always expected to be in the downstream direction
   (initiated by an NSI Querier or the CMTS itself) and Host Membership
   Reporting is expected to be in the upstream direction (from CPE or
   active IGMP CM devices). Either way, the IGMPv2 MIB provides an
   excellent and standard means for managing multicast within a Docsis
   network.

                        Docsis 1.1 IGMPv2 MIB               June 1999


   This description categorizes Docsis 1.1 devices into two classes of
   IGMP awareness as defined by the Docsis 1.1  RFI specification.

     o Passive IGMP devices - this refers to CM and/or CMTS devices
       that derive their IGMP timers from other Êupstream∆ Multicast
       Querier devices. This may be from a Multicast Router on the NSI
       (for the CMTS and/or CM) or the CMTS (for CMs). These devices
       also rely on Êdownstream∆ devices to transmit Membership Reports
       (CPE for a CM; CPE and/or Active CMs for a CMTS) to initiate and
       maintain connectivity.

     o Active IGMP devices - this refers to CM and/or CMTS devices with
       an active IGMP Querier and Host interface. This may be a proxy
       agent or a device with multicast routing capabilities.

   Timers for passive devices must be considered the derived values
   that are being used at the time of the SNMP GET (e.g., read-only).
   Timers for active devices must be considered the values that may be
   managed within the device.


6. Structure of the MIB

   The following describes the application of the IGMPv2 MIB to Docsis
   1.1 devices. This is organized into application of the IGMPv2 MIB to
   CM and CMTS interfaces.

   Note: an additional policy table has been included to cover group
   access rules desired in previous proposals for this MIB to the
   IPCDN. These are included for discussion. It is also feasible that
   this capability be handled using the Cable Device MIB∆s IP Filter
   table.

6.1 Cable Modem igmpInterface Table
   This is the (conceptual) table listing the interfaces on which IGMP
   is enabled. Unless otherwise specified all interface indexes are
   associated with a CPE Side Interface. The only exception is for the
   igmpInterfaceProxyIfIndex, as described below.

   ==================                  ===============================
   igmpInterfaceEntry                  An entry exists for each CM CPE
                                        Side Interface that supports
                                        the IGMP MIB

   igmpInterfaceIfIndex                Corresponds to CM CPE Side
                                        Interface for which IGMP
                                        Querying is enabled.

                                        NOTE: this value is to be
                                        interpreted as follows.

                                        Passive operation: all timers
                                        represent derived values as
                                        defined in the Docsis 1.1 RFI.

                                        Active operation: these are the
                                        values that are used by the
                                        CM∆s CPE-Side Querier.

   igmpInterfaceQueryInterval
                                        Refer to the IGMP MIB.

   igmpInterfaceStatus                 The activation of a row enables
                                        IGMP on this interface. The
                                        destruction of a row disables
                                        IGMP on this interface.

                                        Note: existence of this row
                                        indicates that IGMP and
                                        multicast capabilities exist on
                                        the CM. Non-existence of this
                                        row indicates that a CM is a
                                        non-igmp aware bridge, and must
                                        rely on other Layer 2 or Layer
                                        3 sercices to block unwanted
                                        multicasts.

   igmpInterfaceVersion                Docsis Compliant devices must
                                        support IGMP Version 2 or

   All Querier interfaces apply to downstream, transmitter, interfaces
   (e.g., as opposed to upstream receiver interfaces). Host and/or
   Querier interfaces supported by the CMTS on the NSI-side must follow
   the standard IGMPv2 MIB definitions.

   Note: in most cases, these objects only apply to CPE-side
   interfaces, as described in the introduction, above.

                                        manage IGMP on a per-
                                        transmitter basis may have a
                                        single entry that applies to
                                        all transmitters.

   igmpInterfaceIfIndex                Corresponds to CM CPE Side
                                        Interface for which IGMP
                                        Querying is enabled.
                                        Zero applies to all CMTS HFC-
                                        side TX interfaces

                                        NOTE: this value is to be
                                        interpreted as follows.

                                        Passive operation: all timers
                                        represent derived values as
                                        defined in the Docsis 1.1 RFI.

                                        Active operation: these are the
                                        values that are used by the
                                        CMTS∆s HFC-Side Querier.

   igmpInterfaceQueryInterval
                                        Refer to the IGMP MIB.

   igmpInterfaceStatus                 The activation of a row enables
                                        IGMP on this interface. The
                                        destruction of a row disables
                                        IGMP on this interface.

                                        Note: existence of this row
                                        indicates that IGMP and
                                        multicast capabilities exist on
                                        the CMTS. Non-existence of this
                                        row indicates that a CMTS is a
                                        non-igmp aware multicast
                                        bridge, and must rely on other
                                        Layer 2 or Layer 3 sercices to
                                        block unwanted multicasts.

   igmpInterfaceVersion                Docsis Compliant devices must
                                        support IGMP Version 2 or
                                        higher. Refer to the IGMP MIB.

6.4 Cable Modem Termination System igmpCache Table

   Note: the number of IP Multicast Groups supported by this device on
   a given transmitter, or set of transmitters, is defined as the
   maximum size of this table (implementation specific).

   This is the (conceptual) table that lists the IP Multicast Groups
   for which there are CPE Side Multicast Host Members on a CMCI Side
   interface.

   igmpCacheSelf                       This value should always be
                                        FALSE for the CMTS, as it
                                        should not be considered an
                                        active member of any IP
                                        Multicast groups.

   igmpCacheLastReporter               Refer to the IGMP MIB.

   igmpCacheUpTime                     This should correspond to the

                                        first became active through the
                                        CM.

7. Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public
   internet access to multicast services.  As such, improper
   manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB may result in
   unauthorized access to these services.
