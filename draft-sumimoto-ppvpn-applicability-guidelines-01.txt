2. Introduction (*** Objective and Scope ***)

   *** What is this document? ***

   This document is intended as guidelines to assist in the development
   of applicability statement documents for each specific PPVPN
   approach.  Towards this end, it provides a high level discussion of
   the applicability and limitations of PPVPNs and identifies a list of
   PPVPN requirements. Individual applicability statements may associate
   the applicability and limitations of the specific approach with this
   list of requirements. In this respect, this document may also help
   providers and users to define the applicability scenarios of each
   PPVPN approach and to position it against a set of requirements.

   *** Terminology (PPVPN, Layer 3/Layer2 VPNs, CE-based VPNs)***

   The term "PPVPNs" refers to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for which
   the service provider participates in management and provisioning of
   the VPN, and there are multiple different types of PPVPNs. One
   distinction between the various types of VPNs considered in this
   document, is the distinction between PE-based VPNs and CE-based VPNs.
   Furthermore, from the customer's layer viewpoint, PE-based VPNs are
   classified into two categories, layer 3 and 2 PE-based VPNs. Multiple
   technical approaches are possible in these categories (e.g., BGP MPLS
   VPNs as defined in [2547bis], VR VPNs as defined in [VPN-VR] or
   [2917bis] are approaches included in layer 3 VPNs). This document
   provides a description of these individual approaches in Section 3.
   For more detail on definitions of all technical terms mentioned in
   this paragraph, see [VPN-FR].

   *** Scope and organization of this draft, and scope expected in
       each individual AS draft ***

   Section 3 provides technical overview of each PPVPN approach to
   facilitate understanding of applicability and limitations content.
   Section 4 outlines requirements for PPVPNs as a basic list for
   discussing applicability and limitations. The same list may be used
   for individual AS documents to be developed in future.  Section 5
   presents applicability of PPVPNs and Section 6 presents limitations
   of PPVPNs. Section 7 is for security considerations, section 8 for
   references. This document focuses on discussion common to all
   approaches, however, it may play an introductory role toward
   individual AS documents to be developed in future. Detailed
   applicability and limitations sections are expected to be developed
   in these individual AS documents.

3. PPVPN technical overview

   *** Brief overview of PPVPN types ***

   This section provides a brief overview on the various types of PPVPNs
   as an introductory guidance toward discussions in the rest of this
   document and in developing individual AS documents. Individual
   approach-specific AS documents are expected to include more detailed
   technical overview of the respective approach.
   Note that as some of the engineering tradeoffs between different
   types of PPVPNs are important, this document will discuss them in a
   further version.

   PE-based VPNs means VPNs whose VPN-specific functions are deployed by
   the SP in the provider edge devices, while the customer equipment has
   no VPN awareness.  PE-based VPNs may be distinguished by the service
   layer offered.

   - Layer 3 PE-based VPNs

     In a layer 3 PE-based VPN service, a customer site receives IP
     layer (i.e., layer 3) service from the SP. The CE and PE are
     adjacent to each other at the data link layer and the IP layer
     across the access network. The PE performs forwarding of user data
     packets based on information in the IP layer header, such as an
     IPv4 or IPv6 destination address. The CE sees the PE as a layer 3
     device such as an IPv4 or IPv6 router.

   - Layer 2 PE-based VPNs

     In a layer 2 PE-based VPN service, a CE receives data link layer
     (i.e., layer 2) service from the SP. The CE and PE are adjacent to
     each other at the data link layer and not at the IP layer across
     the access network. A PE performs forwarding of user data packets
     based on information in the packets' data link layer headers, such
     as a frame relay DLCI or 802.1q VLAN tag. That is, the CE sees the
     PE as a layer 2 device such as a FR switch or an Ethernet VLAN
     switch.

   Both layer 3 and 2 PE-based VPNs include various technical
   approaches. Specific approaches of layer 3 PE-based VPNs include BGP
   MPLS VPNs as defined in [2547bis], virtual routers (VRs) as defined
   in [VPN-VR] or [2917bis]. Specific approaches of layer 2 PE-based
   VPNs include port-based VPNs (i.e., where the SP provides a layer 2
   interface, such as Frame Relay or ATM, to the VPN customer, while
   using IP-based mechanisms in the provider infrastructure to improve
   scalability and configurability over traditional L2 networks). All
   types of PPVPNs adopt some tunneling mechanisms in SP networks based
   on IP (for example, MPLS, L2TP, GRE and IPsec) and service providers
   participate in management and provisioning of the PPVPNs. The
   tunneling mechanisms considered for layer 2 PPVPNs are those
   specified in the charter of the pwe3 working group i.e., MPLS, GRE
   and L2TP. This is part of the requirements mentioned in the following
   section.

   This document also provides brief overview of CE-based VPNs here, for
   mentioning requirements specific to CE-based VPNs below.

   - CE-based VPNs

     In CE-based VPNs, the VPN-specific functions (e.g. tunneling) are
     deployed in the customer edge devices, while the provider network
     has no VPN awareness on the data-plane level. For provider
     provisioned CE-based VPNs, the VPN functions on the CE device are
     managed by the service provider [VPN-FR].

INTERNET-DRAFT                                         November 21, 2001


     With CE-based VPNs, the VPN tunnels are IP tunnels (IPsec, L2TP,
     GRE, etc.) originated at the CE devices. The PE device will forward
     the customer's IP packets based on the encapsulating (outer) IP
     header. As such, the PE device and the CE device have a peering
     relationship at the IP level, but the PE device has no VPN
     knowledge.

4. Outline of requirements for PPVPNs

   *** Why and how does this document outline requirements? ***

   This section briefly outlines main requirements for PPVPNs provided
   in [VPN-REQ] as a basic list for discussing applicability and
   limitations in the following sections. Detailed requirements are out
   of the scope of this document,  because these are fully presented in
   [VPN-REQ]. This section classifies the requirements into 3
   categories, general requirements (for both layer 3/layer 2 PE-based
   VPNs and CE-based VPNs), requirements specifically for PE-based layer
   3 VPNs, and requirements specifically for layer 2 PE-based VPNs and
   requirements specifically for CE-based VPNs. Above distinction is
   just a suggestion to be discussed. The point we want to raise here is
   that we should classify requirements according to the most
   appropriate way to develop individual AS documents.  Apart from
   customer/service provider requirement distinction, a more extended
   classification could be :
      - general requirements,
      - service-specific requirements (L3 PE-based, L2 PE-based,
        CE-based, etc.), basically following current framework/req ID
        taxonomy
      - solution-specific requirements, or approach-specific
        requirements
       (we may have in theory more than one solution per each approach)

   *** Concrete list of the requirements: 4.1 - 4.4 ***

4.1 General requirements

   4.1.1 Security (including threat analysis as mentioned in charter)

     Each PPVPN solution should support a range of security related
     features.  Basic levels of security service, like traffic
     isolation, should be supported. Enhanced levels of security
     services, like edge-to-edge encryption, authentication, or replay
     attack prevention should be supported if some customers require
     them. Furthermore, firewall functionality may be desired when
     Internet access is provided.

   4.1.2 QoS and SLA support



Sumimoto                    Expires May 2002                    [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                         November 21, 2001


     With regards to QoS support, a PPVPN shall be able to support QoS
     in one or more of the following standard modes:
        - Best Effort  (support mandatory for all PPVPN types)
        - QoS support (e.g., Intserv) by RSVP, TE by RSVP extension or
     CR-LDP
        - Diffserv marked
        - Across packet-switched access networks

   4.1.3 Manageability (including ease of monitoring/accounting)

     An SP and its customers must be able to manage the capabilities and
     characteristics of their VPN services. To the greatest possible
     extent, automated operations and interoperability with standard
     management platforms should be supported.

   4.1.4 Interoperability

     Each technical solution should support the Internet standards (in
     terms of compatibility and modularity). Multi-vendor
     interoperability at network element, network and service levels
     among different implementations of the same technical solution
     should be guaranteed (that will likely rely on the completeness of
     the corresponding standard). This is a central requirement for SPs
     and customers. The technical solution must be multi-vendor
     interoperable not only within the SP network infrastructure, but
     also with the customer's network equipment and services making
     usage of the PPVPN service.

   4.1.5 Scalability (convergence time, routing tables, VPN size,
   routing instances, etc)

     Routing updates in VPNs shall not affect the stability of the SP
     network. Applicability and limitations in relation with parameters
     provided in 5.1.1 [PPVPN-REQ] should be provided. (See 5.1.2
     [PPVPN-REQ] for solution-specific metrics)

   4.1.6 Migration impact

     A range of scenarios of customer migration must be supported. Full
     migration of all sites must be supported. Support for cases of
     partial migration is highly desirable [Y.1311.1], that is, legacy
     private network sites that belong to the PPVPN service should still
     have L2 connectivity or L3 reachability to the sites that migrate
     to the PPVPN service.

   4.1.7 Learning VPN Related Information

     Configuration of CE and PE devices is a significant task for a

INTERNET-DRAFT                                         November 21, 2001


     service provider. Solutions should strive to contain methods that
     dynamically allow VPN information to be learned by relevant PEs
     and/or CEs to reduce configuration complexity.

   4.1.8 Reliability (Including Protection/Restoration)

     The Service provider should be able to deploy protection and
     restoration mechanisms within the service provider's backbone
     infrastructure to increase reliability and fault tolerance of the
     VPN service offering. These techniques should be scalable.
     Therefore, implementation of such function in the backbone on a
     per-VPN basis may be prohibited.

   4.1.9 Network environment

     Functions required to PEs:
     Some PPVPN types or approaches require special functions to PEs.
     The less such special functions are, the easier to deploy.
     (To be completed.)

   4.1.10 Support of various service scenarios (inter-AS, wholesale,
     Internet access, extranet, etc.)

     (To be filled out.)

   4.1.11 Support of various connectivity scenarios (access network
     connectivity, etc.)

     (To be filled out.)

   4.1.12 Topology

     A PPVPN should support arbitrary, customer agent defined inter-site
     connectivity, ranging, for example, from hub-and-spoke, partial
     mesh to full mesh topology.

   4.1.13 Operation/Deployment considerations (including adding/moving
   sites)

     Ease of Operation/Deployment is highly desired. Special skill for
     operation/deployment may be an obstacle.
     (To be completed.)

   4.1.14 Routing protocol and policy routing support

     There should be no restriction on the routing protocols used
     between CE and PE devices or between CE devices. At least the
     following protocols must be supported: static routing, IGP, such as

     RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP.
     (To be completed.)

   4.1.15 Cost considerations

     (To be filled out.)

4.2 Requirements specifically for Layer 3 PE-based VPNs

   4.2.1 Addressing

     The following supports from PPVPN solutions are required:

        o globally unique/private IP addresses, IPv4/IPv6, for both
          unicast and multicast
        o obtained by the customer from IANA / statically assigned by
          the PPVPN service provider
        o on-demand, dynamically assigned IP addresses (e.g., DHCP),
          irrespective of whether the access is temporary (e.g.,
          remote) or permanent (i.e., dedicated)

     Customer VPN address overlapping shall be supported - IP addresses
     have to be unique only within a given VPN, but not across VPNs.  In
     the case where private IP addresses are used, a PPVPN solution must
     provide a means for an SP to translate such addresses to public IP
     addresses for communication with other VPNs using overlapping
     addresses, or the Internet.

   4.2.2 Interworking with other solutions

     Service interworking among different solutions providing PPVPN
     services is highly desirable and should be supported in a scalable
     manner as much as possible.

   4.2.3 Provisioning Value-Added Service Access

     (To be filled out.)

4.3 Requirements specifically for Layer 2 PE-based VPNs

   (Requirements from the following references are to be outlined

       draft-heinanen-dirldp-eth-vpns-01.txt.)

4.4 Requirements specifically for CE-based VPNs


   4.4.1 Addressing

     Same requirements as in section in 4.2.1.

   4.4.2 Support for dynamic routing

     Independently of the used tunneling mechanism and the way the VPN
     tunnels are established, a CE-based VPN solution should support for
     the dynamic distribution of routing information between different
     sites of the same VPN. The relationship between routing
     information, VPN membership and VPN tunnel status should always be
     consistent.

   4.4.3 SP's management system requirements

     As the SP will configure the VPN functions on the customer's CE
     devices, the 'provisioning mechanism' that is used plays an
     important role. Different options are available for this
     provisioning: manual configuration, the use of a management
     protocol (e.g. SNMP, COPS, etc.), of a directory access protocol
     (e.g. LDAP), etc. Important requirements with regards to this
     provisioning scheme are:

     - the scalability (as a single SP may need to provision a
       large amount of CE devices from a large number of VPNs)

     - the security aspects with regards to authentication,
       privacy etc. (as the security of the VPN management affects
       the complete security of the VPN itself).

5. Applicability

   *** Applicability description of identified solutions ***

   5.1 Security

     All of PPVPN approaches (BGP-VPNs, VR, port-based VPNs) achieve
     logical traffic isolation by adopting VPN tunnels operated by
     service providers. All of PE-based VPN solutions prohibit an end
     user from IP masquerade or mis-delivering toward unauthorized VPNs,
     as a PE identifies correspondence between L2 interfaces toward CEs



Sumimoto                    Expires May 2002                    [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                         November 21, 2001


     and VPNs. All of CE-based VPN solutions achieve logical traffic
     isolation by adoption direct VPN tunnels between CE devices. It
     follows that all of PPVPN solutions achieve the same security level
     as VPNs implemented by TDM or packet network. For more discussion
     regarding stronger security, see the limitation section.

   5.2 QoS support/SLA support

   - Best effort

     Any IP packet delivery of both BGP MPLS and VR approach by using
     any tunneling technology (MPLS, IPsec, or GRE) without optional QoS
     support mechanisms is best effort.

   - QoS support (e.g., Intserv by RSVP, TE by  RSVP extension or CR-
     LDP)

     Any [current] individual approach documents do not specify how they
     support QoS by RSVP [extension] or CR-LDP. If an individual
     approach can support it, the corresponding approach-specific AS
     document should clarify its applicability and limitations from the
     viewpoint of interval, kind of services, and how to operate.

   - Diffserv

     If an individual approach can support it, the corresponding
     approach-specific AS document should clarify its applicability and
     limitations from the viewpoint of interval, kind of services, and
     how to operate.  ('A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture' [2917bis]
     refers to a method to support diffserv by using private LSPs per
     VPN. Other [current] individual approach documents do not specify
     how they support diffserv.)

     Furthermore, method for tunnels to carry DSCP information must be
     clarified, since it depends on which tunneling technology is used
     and this document should make sure of them.  Current situation of
     such clarification is as follows;

       MPLS -- Work in progress [MPLS-DIFF].

       IPsec, IP in IP -- [RFC2983] gives two conceptual models for the
       interaction of diffserv with IP tunnels and relevant
       considerations.

       GRE -- There is no field to carry DSCP information in GRE header.
       Moreover, there is no specification of how to treat fields for
       DSCP between an outer IP header and an inner IP header in case
       that GRE is applied for IP encapsulation within IP.

   5.3 Manageability

     Defining MIBs for BGP MPLS VPNs approach are on progress.  VR
     approach- specific MIBs are on progress. MIBs for the port-based
     VPN approaches are not currently defined (some work in pwe3 WG may
     be used for that). A MIB for the PP CE-based approach is not
     currently defined. Detailed descriptions are expected to be
     included in each AS document per technical solution.

   5.4 Interoperability

     Each approach-specific AS document must clarify applicability and
     limitation in terms of interoperability within each technical
     solution belonging the approach.

   5.5 Scalability

     See the limitations Section.

   5.6 Migration impact

     Most important point here is whether any CE can access a PE in the
     same manner as it accesses VPNs based on leased lines. As VR
     approach makes use of standard routing protocols without any
     extensions, any CE of VR approach can access a PE in the same
     manner as it accesses VPNs based on leased lines. With regard to
     BGP MPLS approach, any CE can access a PE in the same manner as it
     accesses VPNs based on leased lines if the CE does not directly
     participate in BGP MPLS control. However, as is well known , any CE
     is required extended BGP capability if the CE directly participates
     in BGP MPLS control.
     See the limitation section.

   5.7 Learning VPN Related Information

     This item specifically provides whether each approach can supports
     auto-discovery mechanisms. Detail should be described in each
     approach-specific AS document. If some constraints exist, they
     should be clarified in the limitations section.  Both VR and BGP
     MPLS approach can support membership discovery mechanism.
     See the same item in the limitations Section.

   5.8 Reliability

     If some  restoration/recovery mechanisms are built in tunneling
     technologies, they are useful to enhance reliability of PPVPNs. If
     such built-in mechanism is not available, route duplication may be
     used for enhancing reliability of PPVPNs.

   5.9 Network environment

     Each approach-specific AS document must clarify special
     requirements on network environment for using the approach.  Some
     examples are given here. Though VR approach requires that PE
     devices implement VR functions, it does not always require
     implementation of any extension of standard routing protocols. BGP
     MPLS approach requires that PE devices implement not only VRF
     functions but also extended BGP and semantics specified in
     [2547bis].
     Note that PE devices of BGP MPLS approach are required MPLS
     functions even in case that VPN tunnels are supported by IPsec or
     GRE (i.e., other than MPLS) within SP networks.

   5.10 Support of various service scenarios (inter-AS, wholesale,
     Internet access, extranet, etc.)

     (To be filled out.)

   5.11 Support of various connectivity scenarios (access network
     connectivity, etc.)

     (To be filled out.)

   5.12 Topology

     As applicability of topology depends on each technical solution,
     each AS document for specific technical solution is expected to
     describe this issue for the solution.

   5.13 Operation/Deployment considerations (Includes adding/moving
   sites)

     (To be filled out.)

   5.14 Routing protocol and policy routing support

     Applicability of layer 3 PPVPN interworking is described here,
     based on the interworking interface section of [PPVPN-FR]. Static
     interworking on data plane without auto-discovery nor management
     has been made available between VR approach and BGP MPLS approach.
     See limitations Section for a limitation related auto-discovery and
     management.

   5.18 Provisioning Value-Added Service Access

     (To be filled out.)

6. Limitations

   *** Description of general limitations of identified solutions ***

   6.1 Security

     Not all PPVPN solutions support confidentiality, integrity,
     authentication, and replay attack prevention. To achieve them,
     IPsec (or other encryption mechanism) must be used as tunneling
     mechanism or used over VPN tunnels. Even with the use of IPsec, the
     security level offered is dependent on the scope of the IPsec
     security: encrypting on a CE-to-CE basis (as in CE-based VPNs) will
     offer a higher level of protection than encrypting on a PE-to-PE
     basis (as in PE-based VPNs).
     Note that some configuration error can cause traffic isolation to
     be broken.

   6.2 Scalability

     (To be filled out.)

   6.3 Learning VPN Related Information

     BGP MPLS approach is bound to specific membership discovery
     mechanism using extended BGP and semantics specified in [2547bis].

   6.4 Operation/Deployment considerations (including adding/moving
   sites)

     (To be filled out.)

   6.5 Addressing

     In case that a site belongs to multiple PPVPNs, they cannot have
     duplicated IP addresses.
     (To be completed.)

   6.6 Interoperability

     Each approach-specific AS document must clarify limitations in
     terms of interoperability within each technical solution belonging
     the approach.

   6.7 Interworking with other solutions

     Auto-discovery and management scheme beyond interworking interface
     is not clear at present.

   (*)Other items have to be added.
