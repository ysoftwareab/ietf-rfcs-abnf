             Passive Transport Layer Security (TLS) Clients
                   draft-badra-tls-passive-client-00

Abstract

   This document describes a technique for a Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) server to initiate a TLS connection to a TLS client.  This is
   accomplished by the TLS client listening on a port number sent from
   the client to the server during the initial TLS Handshake.  This
   document defines a TLS extension for conveying a port number from the
   client to the server.

1.  Introduction

   In the current deployments of applications running over the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246], the clients actively open the TLS
   connections and the servers passively listens for the incoming TLS
   connection on the TCP or UDP port numbers.  This document describes a
   technique for a TLS server to initiate a TLS connection to a TLS
   client.  This is accomplished by the TLS client listening on a port
   number sent from the client to the server during the initial TLS
   Handshake.  This document describes a TLS extension for coveying a
   port number from the client to the server.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Extension Overview

   A new extension type (passive_mode(TBD)) is defined and MAY be
   included by the client in its ClientHello message.  For servers aware
   of the password extension but not wishing to use it, they will
   gracefully revert to an ordinary TLS handshake or stop the
   negotiation.

      enum {
        passive_mode(TBD), (65535)
      } ExtensionType;


   The "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain:


      uint16 port_number;


   The extension_data field of a passive_mode extension in a ServerHello
   MUST be empty.

2.1.  Connection Initiation from Server to Client

   Once the initial handshaking is complete, the server MAY actively
   open a TCP or UDP connection to the client using the port number
   received in the ClientHello.  Once the TCP or UDP connection has been
   established, the client takes initiative and sends the TLS
   ClientHello message to begin the TLS abbreviated handshake.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC5246] apply here
   as well.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA to update its registry of TLS extensions
   to assign entry TBD as passive_mode.
