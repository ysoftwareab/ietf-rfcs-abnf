1.  Introduction

   The Mobile Node Identifier Option for MIPv6 [RFC4283] has proved to
   be a popular design tool for providing identifiers for mobile nodes
   during authentication procedures with AAA protocols such as Diameter
   [RFC3588].  To date, only a single type of identifier has been
   specified, namely the MN NAI.  Other types of identifiers are in
   common use, and even referenced in RFC 4283.  In this document, we
   propose adding some basic types that are commonly in use in various
   telecommunications standards, including the IMSI, P-TMSI, IMEI, GUTI,
   and IEEE MAC-layer addresses.  In addition, we include the IPv6
   address itself as a legitimate mobile node identifier.

2.  New Mobile Node Identifier Types

   The following types of identifiers are commonly used to identify
   mobile nodes.  For each type, references are provided with full
   details on the format of the type of identifer.

   EPC supports several encoding systems or schemes including

   o  RFID-GID (Global Identifier),
   o  RFID-SGTIN (Serialized Global Trade Item Number),
   o  RFID-SSCC (Serial Shipping Container),
   o  RFID-GLN (Global Location Number),
   o  RFID-GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier),
   o  RFID-DOD (Department of Defense) and
   o  RFID-GIAI (Global Individual Asset Identifier).

   For each RFID scheme except GID, there are two variations: a 64-bit
   scheme (for example, GLN-64) and a 96-bit scheme (GLN-96).  GID has
   only a 96-bit scheme.  Within each scheme, an EPC identifier can be
   represented in a binary form or other forms such as URI.

   The following list includes the above RFID types as well as various
   other common identifiers and several different types of DUIDs.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.  Insofar as the
   selection of a security association may be dependent on the exact
   form of a mobile node identifier, additional specification may be
   necessary when the new identifier types are employed with the general
   AAA mechanisms for mobile node authorizations.

   Some identifiers (e.g., IMSI) are considered to be private
   information.  If used in the MNID extension as defined in this
   document, the packet including the MNID extension should be encrypted

   so that personal information or trackable identifiers would not be
   inadvertently disclosed to passive observers.  Moreover, MNIDs
   containing sensitive identifiers might only be used for signaling
   during initial network entry.  Subsequent binding update exchanges
   would then rely on a temporary identifier allocated during the
   initial network entry.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The new mobile node identifier types defined in the document should
   be assigned values from the "Mobile Node Identifier Option Subtypes"
   registry.  The following values should be assigned.
