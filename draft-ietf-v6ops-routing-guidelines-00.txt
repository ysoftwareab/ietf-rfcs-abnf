Abstract

   Guidelines on how to manage IPv6 routes are needed for operators of
   networks, either providers or enterprises.  This document is a
   followup on RFC2772 work but for the production IPv6 Internet.
   RFC2772 becomes historic.

Internet-Draft      IPv6 Routing Policies Guidelines          March 2006


1.  Introduction

   To maintain stability, efficiency and scalability of the IPv6
   Internet, guidelines for routing policies are needed for operators
   deploying IPv6 networks.  Prior experience on IPv6 routing guidelines
   on the 6bone[RFC2772], practical deployment of the IPv6 internet and
   IPv6 specifications were used as input to this document.

   This document first describes the different types of addresses and
   then summarizes the suggested policies in RPSL.

   "Advertisement" in this document refers to the prefix advertisement,
   not the next-hop.


2.  Address Types

2.1.  Node-scoped Unicast

   The node-scoped unicast addresses[RFC4291] such as the loopback
   (::1/128), the unspecified (::/128) must not be advertised in an IGP
   or EGP and should be filtered out when received.

2.2.  IPv4-Mapped Addresses

   IPv4-mapped addresses (::FFFF:0:0/96)[RFC4291] must not be advertised
   and should be filtered out.

2.3.  Link-scoped Unicast

   The link-scoped unicast[RFC4291] routes (fe80::/10) must not be
   advertised in an IGP or EGP and should be filtered out when received.

2.4.  Site-scoped Unicast

   The site-scoped unicast routes, known as Unique-local[RFC4193],
   (fc00::/7) may be advertised in an IGP.  It must not be advertised in
   an EGP connected to the global Internet and should be filtered out
   when received.  However, it may be advertised in an EGP between two
   networks sharing a private interconnect, but must not be advertised
   outside the scope of these networks.  When advertised in an EGP,
   these routes should be of length /48.

2.5.  Global Unicast

   The global unicast routes (2000::/3)[RFC4291] may be advertised in an
   IGP or EGP.  A minimal EGP routing policy should filter out routes
   that exceed a maximum length.  Determining the maximum length of a

   global Internet route is outside the scope of this document.

   A finer EGP routing policy may use only the allocated address space
   from IANA to registry as specified in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-unicast-address-assignments.
   This would result in better filtering since the non-allocated
   prefixes will be filtered out.

   An even finer EGP routing policy may use only the assigned address
   space from registries to providers as available in the registry
   databases.  This would result in the best filtering since the non-
   assigned prefixes will be filtered out.  However, this requires the
   synchronization of the filters with the registry databases.

2.5.1.  Documentation Prefix

   The 2001:0db8::/32 prefix[RFC3849] is used for documentation purposes
   and must not be advertised in an IGP or EGP and should be filtered
   out when received.

2.5.2.  6to4

   The 6to4[RFC4291] prefix (2002::/16) may be advertised in an IGP or
   EGP, when the site is running a 6to4 relay or offering a 6to4 transit
   service.  However, the provider of this service should be aware of
   the implications of running such service[RFC3964], which includes
   some specific filtering rules for 6to4.

2.5.3.  Teredo

   The Teredo[RFC4380] prefix (2001::/32) may be advertised in an IGP or
   EGP, when the site is running a Teredo relay or offering a Teredo
   transit service.

2.5.4.  6bone

   The 6bone experimental network used some experimental allocations,
   such as 5f00::/8[RFC1897] and 3ffe::/16[RFC2471] that were later
   returned to IANA[RFC3701].  These prefixes should not be advertised
   in an EGP unless IANA reallocates them subsequently.

2.6.  Default Route

   The default unicast route (::) may be advertised in an IGP.  In an
   EGP, it may be only advertised to the downstream but must not be
   advertised in the core.

2.7.  Multicast

   Multicast addresses (ff00::/8)[RFC4291] have a scope in the address
   field.  In the multicast routing, the routes should be announced
   according to the scope, similar to unicast routes.  Multicast routes
   must not appear in unicast routing tables.

2.8.  Unknown addresses

   Any non listed address above must not be advertised and should be
   filtered out.  Future work might reserve additional address space for
   protocol use which might require specific routing guidelines.  The
   reader should refer to newer versions of the normative references in
   this document to verify the existence of newer protocol address
   space.


3.  Implementing routing policies

   This document focuses on protocol addresses and their use in the
   networks.  It does not discuss any allocation policies and their
   impact on the routing policies, such as /48 Micro-allocations for
   infrastructure providers or maximum length of a unicast prefix.  As
   such, to implement a complete routing policy, one should augment
   these guidelines with the current registry allocation policies and by
   appropriate ingress filtering techniques[RFC3704].

   The Route Policy Specification Language(RPSL)[RFC4012] used in route
   registries supports the policies described in this document and
   should be considered to manage route policies.

   The following RPSL code implements the policies described in this
   document.  This code should be considered as an example and should be
   adapted to its target usage.

   TBD: RPSL code to fill


4.  Security Considerations

   This document list guidelines to improve the security of networks by
   filtering of routing prefixes.
