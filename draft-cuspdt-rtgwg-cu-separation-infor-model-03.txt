    Information Model of Control-Plane and User-Plane Separation BNG
            draft-cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-infor-model-03

Abstract

   To improve network resource utilization and reduce operational
   expense, the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation concept is
   defined in Broadband Forum TR-384.  This document describes the
   information model for the interface between the Control-Plane (CP)
   and the User-Plane (UP) in the CP/UP separation BNG.  This
   information model may involve both the control channel interface and
   the configuration channel interface.  The interface for the control
   channel allows the Control-Plane to send flow tables to the User-
   Plane, such as user's information table, user's interface table, and
   user's QoS table.  And it also allows the User-Plane to report
   resource and statistics information to the Control-Plane.  The
   interface for the configuration channel is in charge of the protocol
   version negotiation between the Control-Plane and User-Plane, the
   configuration for devices of the Control-Plane and User-Plane, and
   the reports of User-Plane's capabilities, etc.  The information model
   defined in this document supports defining a standardized data model.
   Such a data model can be used to specify an interface to the CU
   separation BNG.

1.  Introduction

   To improve network resource utilization and reduce operational
   expense, the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation concept is
   defined in Broadband Forum [TR-384].  The motivation for and
   architecture of the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation BNG is
   discussed in [I.D.cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-bng-architecture].

   This document describes an information model for the interface
   between the Control-Plane (CP) and the User-Plane (UP) separation in
   the CP / UP Separated BNG.  This information model may involve both
   the control channel interface and the configuration channel
   interface.  The interface for control channel allows the Control-
   Plane to send several flow tables to the User-Plane, such as user's
   information table, user's interface table, and user's QoS table, etc.
   And it also allows the User-Plane to report the resources and
   statistics information to the Control-Plane.  The interface for
   configuration channel is in charge of the protocol version
   negotiation of protocols between the Control-Plane and User-Plane,
   the configuration for the devices of Control-Plane and User-Plane,
   and the report of User-Plane's capabilities, etc.  The information
   model defined in this document enables supports defining a
   standardized data model.  Such a data model can be used to define an
   interface to the CU separation BNG.

2.  Concept and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   BNG: Broadband Network Gateway.  A broadband remote access server
   (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes traffic to and from broadband remote
   access devices such as digital subscriber line access multiplexers
   (DSLAM) on an Internet service provider's (ISP) network.  BRAS can
   also be referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).

   CP: Control Plane.  CP is a user control management component which
   supports the management of UP's resources such as the user entry and
   forwarding policy

   UP: User Plane.  UP is a network edge and user policy implementation
   component.  The traditional router's Control Plane and Forwarding
   Plane are both preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user plane.

3.  Control Plane and User Plane Separation BNG Information Model
    Overview

   Briefly, a CU separation BNG is made up of a centralized CP and a set
   of UPs.  The CP is a user control management component that manages
   UP's resources such as the user entry and forwarding policy, for
   example, the access bandwidth and priority management.  The UP is a
   network edge and user policy implementation component.  It can
   support the forwarding plane functions on traditional BNG devices,
   such as traffic forwarding, QoS, and traffic statistics collection,
   and it can also support the control plane functions on traditional
   BNG devices, such as routing, multicast, etc.

                  Figure 1. CU Separated BNG

   The CU separated BNG is shown in Figure 1.  The BNG Control Plane
   could be virtualized and centralized, which provides significant
   benefits such as centralized session management, flexible address
   allocation, high scalability for subscriber management capacity, and
   cost-efficient redundancy, etc.  The functional components inside the
   BNG Service Control Plane can be implemented as Virtual Network
   Functions (VNFs) and hosted in a Network Function Virtualization
   Infrastructure (NFVI).

   The User Plane Management module in the BNG control plane centrally
   manages the distributed BNG User Planes (e.g. load balancing), as

   well as the setup, deletion, maintenance of channels between Control
   Planes and User Planes.  Other modules in the BNG control plane, such
   as address management, AAA, and etc., are responsible for the
   connection with outside subsystems in order to provide the service.
   The routing control and forwarding Plane in the BNG User Plane
   (local) could be distributed across the infrastructure.

3.1.  Service Data Model Usage

   The idea of this information model is to propose a set of generic and
   abstract information models to be used in both Control Plane and User
   Planes.  A typical scenario would be that this model can be used as a
   compendium to realize the communication between the Control Plane and
   User Planes of the CU separation BNG.

   As shown in Figure 2, when users access the BNG network, the control
   plane solicits these users' information (such as user's ID, user's
   MAC, user's access methods, for example via PPPoE/IPoE), associates
   them with available bandwidth which is reported by User planes, and
   based on the service's requirements generates a set of tables, which
   may include user's information, user's IP address, and QoS.  Then the
   control plane can transmit these tables to the User planes.  User
   planes receive these tables, parse them, matches these rules, and
   then performs corresponding actions.

4.  Information Model

   This section specifies the information model in Routing Backus-Naur
   Form [RFC5511].  This grammar intends to help readers better
   understand the English text description in order to derive a data
   model.  However it may not provide all the details provided by the
   English text.  When there is a lack of clarity, the English text will
   take precedence.

   This section describes the information model that represents the
   interface of the CU separation BNG that is language and protocol
   neutral.

4.1.  Information Model for Control-Plane

   This section describes information model for the Control-Plane (CP).
   As mentioned in Section 3, the Control Plane is a user control
   management component which manages the user's information, User-
   Plane's resources and forwarding policy, etc.  The control plane can
   generate several tables which contain a set of rules based on the
   resources and specific requirements of user's service.  After that,
   the control plane sends the tables to User Planes, and User planes
   receive the tables, parse them, match the rules, and then perform
   corresponding actions.

   The Routing Backus-Naur Form grammar below specifies the Information
   model for Control-Plane:

   IFINDEX (4 bytes): The IfIndex is the 32-bit index assigned to the
   interface by the device as specified by the Interfaces Group MIB
   [RFC2863].  The IfIndex can be utilized within a management domain to
   map to an actual interface, but it is also valuable in public
   applications.  The IfIndex can be used as an opaque token to discern
   which interface of the User-Plane is providing the corresponding
   service for specific user.

   BAS_ENABLE (2 bytes): This is a flag, and if it is TRUE, the BRAS is
   enabled on this interface.

4.2.  Information Model for User Plane

   This section describes the information model for the interface of to
   the User Plane (UP).  As mentioned in section Section 3, the UP is a
   network edge and user policy implementation component.  It supports
   the following: Forwarding plane functions on traditional BNG devices,
   including traffic forwarding, QoS, and traffic statistics collection
   and Control plane functions on traditional BNG devices, including
   routing, multicast, and MPLS.

   In CU separation BNG information model, the CP generates tables and
   provides the entries.  The UP plays two roles:

   1.  It receives these tables, parses them, then performs
       corresponding actions.

   2.  It also generates several tables to report the available
       resources (such as usable interfaces, etc.) and statistical
       information to CP.

   IFINDEX (4 bytes): IfIndex is the 32-bit index assigned to the
   interface by the device as specified by the Interfaces Group MIB
   [RFC2863].  The IfIndex can be utilized within a management domain to
   map to an actual interface, but it is also valuable in public
   applications.  The IfIndex can be used as an opaque token to discern
   which interface of the User-Plane is available.

   IF_NAME (64 bytes): the textual name of the interface.  The value of
   this object should be the name of the interface as assigned by the
   local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at
   the device's "console".  This might be a text name, such as "le0" or
   a simple port number, such as "1", depending on the interface naming
   syntax of the device.  If several entries in the ifTable together
   represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will
   have the same value of ifName.

   IF_TYPE (4 bytes): the type of interface, such as Ethernet, GE, Eth-
   Trunk, etc.

   LINK_TYPE (4 bytes): This attribute specifies the type of link, such
   as point-to-point, broadcast, multipoint, point-to-multipoint,
   private and public (accessibility and ownership), etc.

   MAC_ADDRESS (6 bytes): This attribute specifies the available
   interface's MAC address.

   IF_PHY_STATE (1 byte): The current operational state of the
   interface.  This is an enumeration type node:

      1- Up: ready to pass packets;

      2- Down

      3- Testing: in some test mode;

      4- Unknow: status cannot be determined for some reason;

      5- Dormant;

      6- Not present: some component is missing.

   MTU: This attribute specifies the available interface's MTU (Maximum
   Transmission Unit).

4.2.2.  Traffic Statistics Infor

   The user-plane also generates the traffic statistics table to report
   the current traffic statistics.

   The Figure below specifies the Traffic Statistics Infor model of
   User-Plane:

   <traffic-statistics-information>::=<USER_ID><STATISTICS_TYPE>
                                      <INGRESS_STATIISTICS_PACKETS>
                                      <INGRESS STATISTICS_BYTES>
                                      <EGRESS_STATISTICS_PACKETS>
                                      <EGRESS_STATISTICS_BYTES>


   USER_ID (4 bytes): is the identifier of user.  This parameter is
   unique and mandatory.  This attribute is used to distinguish
   different users.  In conjunction with other statistics parameters
   such as ingress packets, egress packets, etc, it is used to report
   the user's status profile.

   STATISTICS_TYPE (4 bytes): This attributes specifies the traffic type
   such as IPv4, IPv6, etc.

   INGRESS_STATIISTICS_PACKETS (8 bytes): This attribute specifies the
   Ingress Statistics Packets of specific user.

   INGRESS STATISTICS_BYTES (8 bytes): This attribute specifies the
   Ingress Statistics Bytes of specific user.

   EGRESS_STATISTICS_PACKETS (8 bytes): This attribute specifies the
   Egress Statistics Packets of specific user.

   EGRESS_STATISTICS_BYTES (8 bytes): This attribute specifies the
   Egress Statistics Bytes of specific user.
