Abstract

   interoperable framework for Internet commerce capabilities of Version
   1 while replacing the XML messaging and digitial signature part of
   IOTP v1 with standards based mechanisms.

INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP v2 Requirements             February 2001


1. Introduction

   Verion 2 of the Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) will extend the
   interoperable framework for Internet commerce capabilities of Version
   1 [RFC 2801] as described in Section 3 below.  In addition, it will
   replace the ad hoc XML messaging and digitial signature [RFC 2802]
   parts of IOTP v1 with standards based mechanisms.

   This early draft gives requirements for IOTP Version 2 based on the
   TRADE workging group charter.



2. Design Principles and Scope

   1. The specification must describe the syntax and processing
      necessary for an extension of the interoperable framework for
      Internet commerce described in IOTP V1.0 [RFC 2801].

   2. Keep changes to IOTP V1.0 to a minimum.

   3. Maintain all existing functionality of IOTP V1.0.

   4. Test all XML DTDs and/or Schmeas and XML examples in the
      specification to insure that they are well-formed.

   5. Create usage/implementation guidance information.

   6. It should be designed to work well with other protocols such as
      ECML.

   7. IOTP Version 2 should be developed as part of the broader Web
      design philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data, and
      modularity /layering / extensibility. [Berners-Lee, WebData] In
      this context, this standard should take advantage of existing
      provider (and infrastructure) primitives.



3. Requirements

   IOTP Version 2 will include the following:

   1. Be a superset of IOTP Version 1.

   2. Provide for the Dynamic Definition of Trading Sequences.

   3. Include specification of an Offer Request Block.

   4. Support Improved Problem Resolution (extend to cover presentation

      of signed receipt to customer support party, etc.)

   5. Add provisions to indicate and handle a payment protocol not
      tunneled through IOTP.

   The following may be include in IOTP v2:

   1. Support for wallet servers.

   2. Support Repeated/ongoing payments.

   3. Enhanced Server to Server messages.

   4. Include the ability to add both fields and attributes to trading
      blocks.

   The following are out of scope for IOTP version 2:

   1. Legal or regulatory issues surrounding the implementation of the
      protocol or information systems using it.

   2. Design of an XML Messaging Layer.

   3. Design of XML Digitial Signatures.



4. Security Considerations

   As provided above, IOTP v2 will provide optional authentication via
   standards based XML Digitial Signatures [XMLDSIG]; however, neither
   IOTP v1 nor v2 provide confidentiality mechanism.  Both depend on the
   security mechanisms of any payment system used in conjuction with
   them to secure payments and require the use of secure channels such
   as those provided by TLS [RFC 2246] or IPSEC for confidentiality.
