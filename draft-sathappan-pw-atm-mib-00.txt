2.0 Introduction

    This document describes a Management Information Base for managing ATM VC
    emulation over a Packet Switched Network(PSN).

    This document follows the Requirements for Pseudo-Wire Emulation
    Edge-to-Edge [PWREQ] document, The MIB objects closely work with the MIBs 
    described in [PWMIB] and the textual conventions defined in [PWTC].

    The MIB objects are defined in a way that is not specific to the PSN that
    is emulating this service.

3.0 Terminology
    
   This document follows the terminology used in PW framework [FRMWK].

   Outbound            References the traffic direction where a ATM Cell 
                       is received, adapted to packet, assigned a VC label, 
                       and sent into the PSN.   
    
   Inbound             The direction where packets are received 
                       from the PSN, cells are reconstructed from the packet 
                       payloads, and sent into the ATM Network as cells.
   
   Adaptation          Refers to the method of adapting a "foreign"
                       communications protocol such that it can be
                       carried by a packet switched net (the PSN). For
                       example, in a ATM service the foreign protocol
                       is ATM. The PSN may be MPLS.
   
   PSN                 Public Switched Network.
   
   PSN Tunnel          A general term indicating a virtual connection
                       between the two PW edge devices. In practice
                       this connection is not limited to path-oriented
                       types of PSNs such as MPLS. An example of a non-
                       path-oriented PSN is an IP PSN.

   [BCP14]. 

4.0 The SNMP Management Framework 
 
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
   o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].  
     
   o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16,
     RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 
     [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
     RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
     [RFC2580].  
       
   o Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the 
     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and 
     RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is 
     called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572]
     and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].  
       
   o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol 
     operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
     [RFC1905].  
    
   o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 
     [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described in 
     RFC 2575 [RFC2575].  
       
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. Managed objects are accessed via 
   a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base 
   or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined 
   in the SMI. This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the 
   appropriate translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be 
   semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted 
   because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine

Internet Draft                PWE-ATM MIB               March 1, 2002



   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual 
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this 
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the 
   semantics of the MIB. 
    
     
4.1  Object Definitions 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
   defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a 
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we 
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to 
   the object type. 

5.0 Feature Checklist 
    
   This MIB is designed to satisfy the following requirements and 
   constraints: 
    
    - Fit within the architecture defined [PWMIB].

    - Fit within the model for VC definition/management 
      as defined in the [AToM] MIB.
    
    - MIB supports manually configured ATM VCs

    - MIB supports automatically configured ATM VCs

    - The MIB enables the use of any PSN 
    
    - The MIB supports point-to-point ATM VC connections. 
      Point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point connections 
      are for future study. 
    
    - The MIB allows configuration of all the parameters needed 
      to establish a PW ATM VC.
    
    - The MIB reports: ATM performance metrics for the PW ATM VC.
      This includes cells received, tagged, rejected, transmitted 
      and lost. 

   -  ATM OAM cell support.

    - The MIB does not consider ILMI support

6.0 PW-MIB usage
   
   The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed of three
   layers of MIB modules functioning together. This general model is
   defined in the PWE3 Framework [FRMWK].  The layering model is
   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN
   layer that carries the emulated service. This is done at the same
   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported
   services to any supported PSNs.
   
   The first layer known as the service layer contains service-specific
   modules such as the one defined in this document. These modules
   define service-specific management objects that interface or
   collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the

   service. The service-specific module "glues" the standard module to
   the PWE MIB framework.
   
   The next layer of the PWE MIB framework is comprised of the PW-MIB
   module [PWMIB]. This module is used to configure general parameters
   of PW VCs that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.
   This layer is connected to the service-specific layer above, and the
   PSN layer below.
   
   The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.
   These modules associate the VC with one or more "tunnels" that carry
   the service over the PSN. These modules are defined in other
   documents. This module is used to "glue" the PW service to the
   underlying PSN-specific MIB modules. In the case of MPLS, for
   example, the PW-MPLS MIB [PWMPLSMIB] is used to connect the PW
   service to either the MPLS-LDP [LDPMIB] or MPLS-TE [TEMIB] MIBs.
   
   [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules.
   
6.1 ATM-PW MIB Usage

    In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects 
    described in section 8 to set up a ATM VC. While this example is not meant
    to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid in the
    understanding of some key concepts. It is meant to be read after going
    through the MIB itself. See [PWMIB] for an example of setting up a PSN 
    Tunnel.

    The following example illustrates how a user will set up a AAL5 ATM VC on
    a switch/router with cells entering the switch/router through ATM Interface
    with IfIndex 1000, VPI 1 and VCI 100 (from ATM Network to PSN - outbound
    direction) and on the way back, It goes out of the switch/router through 
    ATM Interface 1000 with VPI 1 and VCI 100 (PSN to ATM Network - inbound 
    direction)

    First create an entry in PW MIB with pwVcType atmAal5Vcc(2),
    then create entries in inbound and outbound tables. 

    In PW ATM MIB

    In pwAtmOutboundTable: 
    {
     pwAtmOutboundAtmIf             1000    --Outbound AtmIf
     pwAtmOutboundVpi               1       --Outbound VPI
     pwAtmOutboundVci               100     --Outbound VCI
     pwAtmOutboundTrafficParamDescr 0.0     -- Best Effort
     pwAtmOutboundRowStatus         createAndGo 
     pwAtmOutboundClpQosMapping     false(0) --CLP wont be mapped to QoS
     pwAtmOutboundOamCellSupported  true(1)  --OAM cells will be sent 
     pwAtmOutboundOverhead          15
    }

    In pwAtmInboundTable
    {
     pwAtmInboundAtmIf             1000 --Inbound AtmIf
     pwAtmInboundVpi               1   --Inbound VPI
     pwAtmInboundVci               100 --Inbound VCI
     pwAtmInboundTrafficParamDescr 0.0 --Best Effort
     pwAtmInboundRowStatus         createAndGo 
     pwAtmInboundOamCellSupported  true(1) --Will accept OAM Cells
    }

7.0 PW-ATM MIB Summary

    This MIB consists of 4 tables. 

    - PW VC ATM Outbound Table
    This Table is used to configure a outbound ATM VC Entry. 

    - PW VC ATM Inbound Table
    This Table is used to configure a inbound ATM VC Entry. 

    - PW VC ATM Outbound Perf Table
    This Table contains the statsistics for an ATM VC Entry in the 
    Outbound direction

    - PW VC ATM Inbound Perf Table
    This Table contains the statsistics for an ATM VC Entry in the 
    Inbound direction

    A TrafficParamDescr Table is not defined as part of this MIB so that users
    can refer to any ATM TrafficDescr Table (e.g atmTrafficDescrParamTable 
    present in the [AToM] MIB)

9.0 Security Considerations
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.
   
   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.
   
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.
   
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.
   
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
