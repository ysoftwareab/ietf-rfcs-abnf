                    URN Namespace for ETSI Documents
                        draft-mahesh-etsi-urn-03

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'etsi' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   European Telecommunications Standards Institute (http://etsi.org).
   ETSI specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN
   identification model.  Management activities for these and other
   resources types are handled by the manager of the ETSI Protocol
   Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS).

1.  Introduction

   ETSI is a nonprofit international industry standards organization,
   that produces globally acceptable standards for Information &
   Communication Technologies including fixed, mobile, radio, broadcast,
   internet, aeronautical and other areas.

   As part of these specifications efforts, there is a need to identify
   identifiers in a managed namespace that are unique and persistent.
   To ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a
   registration of a specific Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141]
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by ETSI is being specified in this
   document, in full conformance with the NID registration process
   specified in the document.

Internet-Draft             Namespace for ETSI                  June 2018


   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization



         Name: European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)

         Address: 650, Route des Lucioles, Sophia Antipolis 06560,
         France

      Designated contact:



         Role: ETSI Protocol Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS)

         Email: pnns@etsi.org

   Purpose:

   To begin with, the URN requested in this document will be used by
   ETSI for allocation of namespaces to be used by YANG modules, that
   are developed by the organization.  These namespaces are globally
   unique.  The URN will be used in public networks by devices used to
   configure and manage resources in the network.  It is these devices
   that will enforce the uniqueness of the namespaces by using the
   namespace and the XPath associated with the managed node in the
   network, when accessing a resource.

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The syntax of namespace specific strings for the 'etsi' namespace
      is <NSS> in Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      ETSI publishes information regarding the registered resources in
      the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry, where it describes the
      <NSS>, how the namespaces will be allocated and how experimental
      namespaces can be used within the allocated URN.
      (https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/
      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx).

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      ETSI will manage resource classes using the "etsi" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent

      strings.  ETSI will guarantee the uniqueness of the strings
      themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility for certain
      defined resources.

      ETSI may allow for use of experimental type values for testing
      purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may create
      collision as multiple users may use the same values for different
      resources and specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      ETSI will update the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry to document
      the registered resources that will use the "etsi" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Assignment of a URN from the ETSI namespace will be documented as
      part of the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry.

   Security and Privacy:

   If an namespace is URN-equivalent to another namespace used by the
   device, as per the rules specified in Section 3.1 of URNs [RFC8141],
   Section 6.1 of URI Generic Syntax [RFC3986], and the lexical rules
   specified in this document, the request is rejected.

   The YANG modules that will use the namespace assigned by this URN
   define a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via a
   network management protocol such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer,
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   Interoperability:

   There are no known interoperability issues at this time.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an Resolution Discovery System
      (RDS).  Therefore this process is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The entire URN is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of ETSI activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following are examples of URNs that ETSI is looking to assign:

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-services

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-interfaces

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   described above, and are normally associated with the use and
   resolution of URNs in general, which are described in Function
   Requirements for URN [RFC1737], Uniform Resource Names (URNs)
   [RFC8141].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry ("etsi") in the urn-namespace
   registry.  This is the defining document.  When published, the entry
   can be found in the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces"
   registry available from the IANA site (http://www.iana.org) and any
   associated mirrors.
