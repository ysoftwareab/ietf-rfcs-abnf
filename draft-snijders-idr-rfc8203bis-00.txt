1.  Introduction

   The Administrative Shutdown Communication [RFC8203] is a simple
   mechanism to transit a short freeform UTF-8 [RFC3629] message as part
   of a Cease NOTIFICATION message [RFC4271] to inform the peer why the
   BGP session is being shutdown or reset.

   Feedback from operators based in regions which predominantly use
   multibyte character sets, showed that messages similar in meaning to
   what can be send in other languages in using single-byte encoding
   failed to fit within the Length constraints as specified by
   [RFC8203].  For example, the phrase: 'Planned work to add switch to
   stack.  Completion time - 30 minutes' has length 65 bytes.  Its
   translation in Russian
   '&#1055;&#1083;&#1072;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;&#1077;
   &#1088;&#1072;&#1073;&#1086;&#1090;&#1099; &#1087;&#1086; &#1076;&#10
   86;&#1073;&#1072;&#1074;&#1083;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1102; &#1082;&#
   1086;&#1084;&#1084;&#1091;&#1090;&#1072;&#1090;&#1086;&#1088;&#1072;
   &#1074; &#1089;&#1090;&#1077;&#1082;.
   &#1042;&#1088;&#1077;&#1084;&#1103; &#1079;&#1072;&#1074;&#1077;&#108

   &#1084;&#1080;&#1085;&#1091;&#1090;' (See PDF for non-ASCII character
   string) has length 139 bytes.

   This document extends the length of the Administrative Shutdown
   Communication to 255 octets.

2.  Changes to RFC 8203

   This section updates [RFC8203] to specify the maximum length of an
   Administrative Shutdown Communication.

Internet-Draft                BGP Shutdown                 December 2017


   The following paragraph replaces the Length definition in Section 2
   (Shutdown Communication):



      Length:  this 8-bit field represents the length of the Shutdown
         Communication field in octets.  When the length value is zero,
         no Shutdown Communication field follows.

   The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of Section 5
   (Security Considerations):

      As BGP Shutdown Communications are likely to appear in syslog
      output, there is a risk that carefully constructed Shutdown
      Communication might be formatted by receiving systems in a way to
      make them appear as additional syslog messages.  To limit the
      ability to mount such an attack, the BGP Shutdown Communication is
      limited to 255 octets in length.

3.  Security Considerations

   TBD

4.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
   Shutdown Communication:

   o  TBD..
