INTERNET DRAFT   Dist. Arch. for Customer Access to Clo   October 19, 2015


1  Introduction

   Customers today connect to the cloud providers using solutions that
   have been conventionally used by service providers to provide
   backhaul to customers. These are based on establishing some sort of
   Layer3 with the service provider (IGP, BGP or static route). The
   service provider then uses an overlay (generally mpls) to carry
   customers' traffic to their other locations where it is delivered to
   the customer over a similar Layer3 handoff.

   In a cloud environment especially in case of hybrid cloud, the
   expectation is to provide customers, access to their assets (compute,
   storage etc.)in the cloud with the same ease as they would access
   their assets at their premises. However, conventional connectivity
   model used by existing cloud providers make it difficult for the
   customers because they require complicated interconnection with the
   cloud provider.

   The other problem with this approach is the scalability and cost
   implications on the edge device at the cloud provider such as:

   1. Number of VRFs

   2. Number of routes

   3. Number of BGP sessions

   4. Cost of high bandwidth interfaces


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the same terminology as [RFC7365].  In addition,
   the following terms are used:


   VRF: Virtual Routing and Forwarding

   Edge: Device at the cloud provider used to connect customers

   Cloud Router: Routing software running on a server or VM

2.  Components of Existing Architecture

   Starting from customer on-prem towards the customer assets in the
   cloud here are the transport components and traffic flow.

   Customer connects to the cloud provider either directly or through
   carrier. When using carrier the most common method is MPLS VPN as
   described in [RFC4364]. In case of carrier, customer either
   establishes a new layer3 connection (mostly BGP)or leverages an
   existing connection with the carrier. While in case of cloud provider
   it will be a new layer3 connection.  For this purpose customer
   deploys or leverages an existing routing device.

   At the cloud provider end there is again a routing device to
   terminate customer connections and establish layer3 connectivity. In
   order to deal with customer security requirements and overlapping
   address space problems, the cloud provider creates VRF at the routing
   device. BGP (or IGP) protocol is used to dynamically exchange
   customer routes. The customer VRF at this edge device stores
   customer's on-prem routes as well as customer routes in the cloud.

   From the edge device the cloud provider establishes some kind of
   overlay encapsulation mechanism to tunnel the traffic towards the
   customer VMs. There are many encapsulation options available today
   and used by the cloud providers such as VXLAN, GRE, NVGRE, IPSec, IP-
   in-IP etc.

   There are tunnel endpoint devices close to customer VMs that are
   responsible for decapsulating the traffic encapsulated by the cloud
   provider edge device. These are NVE devices that can be hardware
   based such as ToRs or can be software gateways in the hypervisor or
   dedicated VMs. The choice and location of these devices varies
   between cloud providers.

3.  Limitation of Existing Architecture

   The edge device at the cloud provider needs to create separate VRF
   for each customer. This pose limitation on the number of customers
   that can be onboarded via single edge device.

   As BGP is the most common protocol being used. These routing devices
   are limited on how many BGP sessions they can establish.

   Another limitation is the number of routes. This is an interesting
   problem. Unlike Internet, in this case the device will have to store
   same prefixes over and over for each customer. So, while the number
   of prefixes may not be huge (as the private address space is limited
   as compared to public address space) but number of instances of same

   prefixes will fill up the route storage capacity of the device very
   quickly. Also, unlike Internet the customer has no need to aggregate
   these prefixes as this network is an extension of their existing
   network. This would mean that either customer is forced to aggregate
   or a new device needs to be deployed to keep up with growing number
   of routes.

   The cost of high speed interfaces on routing devices tend to be quite
   higher than on switching devices. Hence, the cost of the edge device
   is higher to start with.

   An important thing to note here is that all the above factors come
   into play at the same time. Either one of these variable could impact
   other variables and force the upgrade or additional deployment of
   these devices.

   The proposed architecture is based on three tenants.

   1. Separation of control plane and data plane

   2. Leverage extensibility of NVA

   3. Cost reduction

   At the cloud provider there will be a layer2 edge device instead of a
   layer3 edge device. This device will be used for direct or indirect
   physical connection to the customer.

   For the control plane there will be routing software running on a
   server or VM called cloud router. The customer will establish BGP
   connection with the cloud router. This cloud router will get its
   information from NVA. When a customer deploys a new VN the
   provisioning system will update NVA with the NVE and prefix for the
   customer. The NVA will update the cloud router which will send BGP
   update to the customer.

   For the data plane, the edge device will act as an NVE and use
   incoming interface to identify the customer. NVE will need more
   information to craft the header for the incoming packet such as
   destination NVE, encapsulation type etc. NVA will hold customer
   information such as VNID, NVEs belonging to the customer and the
   prefixes that each NVE is serving. There could be a push or pull
   model between NVE and NVA to update information. The destination NVE
   will received the packet, look at the VNID, decapsulate it and
   deliver it to the corresponding VM.

   NVEs that are close the customer VMs can be software or hardware
   NVEs. They use NVA in similar way to get more information about the
   TSs and their VNs. However, there search string could be different.
   For example the NVE could provide NVA with VNID to gather information
   about the destination NVE.

5. Advantages of proposed architecture

   By moving the routing function into cloud router, the route storing
   capacity will be increased many fold and at a very low cost as
   compared to a router. This will also make it more scalable.

   High bandwidth interfaces such as 10G and 40G are much cheaper on a
   switch than on a router. This will reduce the cost. Another advantage
   is space and power. A 48G switch takes less space and consumer less
   power than a 48 port router.

   By deploying a switch the throughput capacity of the device will be

INTERNET DRAFT   Dist. Arch. for Customer Access to Clo   October 19, 2015


   almost non-blocking which will increase the scalability.

   Extensibility of NVA can be leveraged for routing decisions. For
   example NVA can have a field that allows access to certain prefixes
   by a VNID or Sub-VNID. At the ingress NVE packet can be dropped based
   on this policy. Similarly, the NVA can provide information related to
   encapsulation type used by the remote NVE.


3  Security Considerations

   Tenant isolation is the primary concern in a cloud provider. In this
   architecture, tenant information in NVA, Cloud Router and
   encapsulation are three components that need to be tenant specific.
   It is expected that NVO3 will address these issues in their specific
   areas.


4  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any action from IANA.
