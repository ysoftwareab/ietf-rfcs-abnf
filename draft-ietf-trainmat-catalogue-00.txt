1. Introduction

As the range of information and services on the Internet expands, so
does the potential user population.  Given the significant investment in
the network and the various networked information and data services, it
is essential that the broad spectrum of potential users are made aware
of these services.  In particular they require training in using these
facilities and in making effective use of the tools available for
searching for and retrieving information available on the global
network.

The rapid expansion of the user base has made it difficult for network
trainers to keep up with the demand for training. Librarians, Computing
Service staff and subject-based Network Support staff all have a vital
role to play in training users. Easy access to quality network training
materials and the pooling of resources will help spread the load.

The purpose of this document is to provide a catalogue of quality
Network Training Materials for use by Internet trainers.  By providing
such a collection of pointers to useful resources, it is hoped that
trainers will be relieved of much of the load of producing current
training materials.  The intention is to make this a "living document".
It will be held on-line so that each section may be updated separately
as appropriate.


2. How the information was collected

The information contained in this report was collected over the network
by volunteers from the Trainmat Working Group from the contacts for each
network training resource using the Trainmat template. The contents of
this template had been discussed by the Trainmat WG at its meetings and
on the mailing list.

Organization-Name: The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh; State University

Keywords: Originally a course delivered via a Listserv. All lessons now
	stored on a gopher. It only covers gopher though WWW is briefly
	mentioned at the end, hence it seems rather limited now. Some of
	the facts and figures are rather dated. The numbering of the
	lessons is erratic - some numbers are repeated; some missing. A
	chatty, informal style is adopted. The last few lessons discuss
	ways to customise various clients, and may be less useful for a
	general audience as only character-based clients are discussed.
