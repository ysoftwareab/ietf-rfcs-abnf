      Development Plan for Reissuing Existing LDAPv3 RFCs In CY2001
               <draft-wahl-ldapv3-2001plan-00.txt>

1.  Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
   and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   The list of current Internet-Drafts can be accessed at
   http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt

   The list of Internet-Draft Shadow Directories can be accessed at
   http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html.

   Discussion of this document should take place on the LDAP Extensions
   Working Group mailing list <ietf-ldapext@netscape.com>.

2.  Abstract

   The IESG prefers to avoid having RFCs linger in Proposed Standard
   Status.  In general, RFCs which have demonstratable interoperability
   and usefulness should become Draft Standards, and eventually may
   become full Standards, as described in RFC 2026 [1] section 6.2.  

   When a Proposed Standard RFC is reissued to become Draft, corrections,
   clarifications and other changes can be integrated into the update.  
   However, if changes to the protocol are 'very significant', then 
   the document needs to be issued as Proposed Standard again.

   This document describes an approach to reissue the core RFCs which
   describe LDAPv3, all of which are currently at Proposed Standard
   status.  It also summarizes the status of other existing and upcoming
   standards-track LDAP RFCs.

INTERNET-DRAFT       LDAPv3 Existing RFC Development Plan      July 2000

3.  Goal

   The primary goal of this process is to resolve issues in the existing
   LDAPv3 RFCs, while encouraging it to progress towards full standard
   status, and allow for subsequent extension as needed.  This document 
   describes the portion of this process which should occur to cause the 
   core LDAPv3 RFCs, in particular RFC 2251 through RFC 2256, to be 
   republished in CY2001.  (This would mean the Internet Drafts need 
   to be published in CY2000 to give the IESG time to review them).

   This document does not provide information on progressing drafts which
   have not yet been published as RFCs, or on plans for dealing with
   documents which will become RFCs in CY2002 and later, except as they
   impact the formation of the update drafts.

4. General Issues

   The requirements of RFC 2360 [2] should be reviewed to ensure that any
   new internet drafts are in alignment with best current practice.

4.1. Technical Corrections

   Several errors have been found in RFCs 2251-2256 during 
   implementation and interoperability testing which need to be 
   corrected. 

4.2. Enhancements

   The LDAPv3 protocol definition needs to be suitable for extension to 
   meet the needs of current and anticipated protocol and schema 
   extension RFCs.  For example, it is currently only possible to return 
   partial response PDUs for search.

4.3. Textual Changes

   There are several aspects of LDAPv3 which are underdocumented, 
   including the relationship of its data model to X.501, the semantics 
   of the result codes, and the meanings of some of the user attribute 
   types.  There are also no examples of the LDAPv3 protocol encodings. 
   These issues should be resolved in the document updates.

4.4. Other changes

   There have been numerous affiliation changes.   Also, the boilerplate 
   for RFCs has changed.  Finally, because of the publication of 
   the secure authentication methods, the IESG note is no longer needed
   to be included.

4.5. Interdependency

   RFCs 2251-2256 all reference each other.  Prior to publication of 
   updates to one or more of them as draft standards, the dependent text 
   and definitions should be carefully reviewed to ensure that 
   subsequent changes to the other documents would not cause problems.

4.6. External dependencies

   The following documents are referenced by LDAPv3 specifications but 
   have not reached Draft Standard status.  Several of them are no longer
   under consideration by any current IETF working group.

   In addition RFC 2831 includes several references which are not listed
   here.

4.6.1. RFC 1278  A String Encoding of Presentation Address

   This RFC was published in 1991 and is Informational.

4.6.2. RFC 1738  Uniform Resource Locators 

   This RFC was published in 1994 and is a Proposed Standard.

4.6.3. RFC 1766  Tags for the Identification of Languages

   This RFC was published in 1995 and is a Proposed Standard.

4.6.4. RFC 1866  Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0

   This RFC was published in 1995 and is Historic.

4.6.5. RFC 2156  MIXER

   This RFC was published in 1998 and is a Proposed Standard.

4.6.6. RFC 2222  Simple Authentication and Security Layer

   This RFC was published in 1997 and is a Proposed Standard.

4.6.7. RFC 2234  Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications

   This RFC was published in 1997 and is a Proposed Standard.

4.6.8. RFC 2246  TLS Protocol Version 1.0

   This RFC was published in 1999 and is a Proposed Standard.

5. Process By RFC

   Many Obsolete, Experimental, Informational RFCs, and those which apply
   only to non-LDAP protocols, are not listed.

5.1. RFCs published prior to LDAPv3

5.1.1. RFC 1274  COSINE and Internet X.500 Schema

   This RFC is at Proposed Standard status.  It has been partially 
   replaced by RFC 2256, which borrowed its schema definitions for 
   X.500 attributes.  However, many schema definitions remain in this 
   document, and are used by RFC 2798.  A new document should update or 
   replace RFC 1274, however there is currently no work item for this 
   activity.

5.1.2. RFC 1777  LDAPv2 

   This RFC is at Draft Standard status.  

   It is anticipated that the next revision of the LDAPv3 protocol RFCs 
   will obsolete the LDAPv2 protocol. 

5.1.3. RFC 1778  String Representation of Standard Attribute Syntaxes

   This RFC is at Draft Standard status, and is updated by RFC 2559.

   It is anticipated that the next revision of the LDAPv3 schema and 
   syntax RFCs will obsolete the LDAPv2 syntaxes.

5.1.4. RFC 1781  Using the OSI Directory to Achieve User Friendly Naming

   This RFC, published in 1995, is at Proposed Standard status.  There is
   no known work item to update this document.

5.1.5. RFC 1798  Connectionless Lightweight X.500 Directory Access 
       Protocol

   This RFC, published in 1995, is at Proposed Standard status.  There 
   is a work item of LDAPEXT to produce a replacement document, which 
   would initially be a Proposed Standard as it incorporates several new 
   requirements.

5.1.6. RFC 1823  LDAP API

   This RFC, published in 1995, is Informational.  There is a work item 
   of LDAPEXT to produce a replacement document, which would initially 
   be a Proposed Standard as it incorporates several new requirements.

6. Current Internet Drafts affecting the core definition

6.1. Replication

   Changes and clarifications to the protocol and client-visible service
   model needed by the replication activity in the LDUP working group 
   will be integrated into the updates to 2251.   The replication 
   protocol itself is being published independently, using the extension 
   framework.

6.2. Access Control Model

   This is a work item of LDAPEXT.  It is anticipated that an RFC will be
   published in CY2001.  There will be impact on the core data model
   definitions, and possibly the protocol as well.

6.3. Applicability Statement

   As there are increasingly more RFCs which form the LDAPv3 core and 
   extensions, an applicability statement is needed to define how and
   in what situations the technical specifications are used.

6.4. Result Codes and partial response

   Drafts have been produced which includes updates to the LDAPv3 
   protocol, whose contents will be integrated into the next update
   to the LDAPv3 protocol.  The result codes draft has been reviewed
   by the LDAPEXT working group.

6.5. Data Model Definitions

   The relationship of the LDAPv3 data model to that of X.501(1993) is 
   underspecified in RFC 2251.  Also, it is difficult to implement LDAPv3
   without a copy of the (non-freely-available) X.501 specification.  
   This new document includes definitions of the key terms used in the 
   LDAP protocol and their relationships to those of X.501(1993).  This 
   will allow the protocol document to focus on the protocol definition 
   itself.

7. Other Drafts

   There are several working groups currently defining schemas for 
   use in LDAPv3 directories.

   There are also numerous individual submissions of protocol extensions.

8. Security Considerations

   Security Considerations are not discussed in this memo.  This 
   document is not intended to become an RFC.
