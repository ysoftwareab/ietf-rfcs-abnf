         Router Advertisement Extensions for On-Demand Mobility
                    draft-feng-dmm-ra-prefixtype-02

Abstract

   Router Advertisement / Router Solicitation is one of the ways for
   hosts to establish network IPv6 connectivity configuration.  This
   document describes two approches to allowing a router to specify
   service continuity type availability to mobile hosts.  Mobile hosts
   can then configure their IP address to the preferred service
   continuity type.  Two possibilities are considered: (i) creating an
   extension to the router advertisement prefix information option to
   allow the router to specify service connectivity types, and (ii)
   specifying a new RA options that allows the router to specify the
   service connectivity types.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-dmm-ondemand-mobility] defines different types of mobility
   related network services provided by access network to mobile hosts.
   In particular, it defines different types of service continuity types
   as mobile nodes move between different points of attachments.

   This document proposes two such options to the router advertisement
   message ([RFC4861]) to allow the router to convey service continuty
   types services associated with an Ipv6 prefix.  The possibilities
   considered are: (i) creating an extension to the router advertisement
   prefix information option to allow the router to specify service
   connectivity types, and (ii) specifying a new RA options that allows
   the router to specify the service connectivity types.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Router Advertisement Extensions

   IP prefixes are conveyed in Router Advertisement messages through the
   Prefix Information Option field ([RFC4861]).  These prefix
   information option fields are used to allow hosts to configure their
   IPv6 addresses.

   For distributed mobility management, there is a need for a network to
   be able to convey different prefixes for different connectivity
   scenarios.  [I-D.ietf-dmm-ondemand-mobility] defines different
   service continuity requirements including: Non-Persistent, Session-
   Lasting, Fixed, and Graceful-replacement.  Currently, however, there
   is no way for a router to specify the continuity type through a
   router advertisement message.

   This document proposes two possibilities for modifying the router
   advertisement message to include service continuity options that it
   is offering to mobile hosts that are attached: (i) creating an
   extension to the router advertisement prefix information option (PIO)
   to allow the router to specify service connectivity types, and (ii)
   specifying a new RA options that allows the router to specify the
   service connectivity types.

3.1.  Modifying PIO

   The first option is to modify the PIO.  The advantages of this
   approach are that it is semantically in line with the intended
   function.  That is, specifying prefix options.  This, however,
   requires the modification of several bits in the existing PIO to
   support the specification of the service connectivity type.

   The modified prefix information option fields are shown in the
   following figure:


        0                   1                   2                   3

   Fields:

   Prefix Length  8-bit unsigned integer.  The number of leading bits in
                  the Prefix that are valid.  The value ranges from 0 to
                  128.

   L              1-bit on-link flag.  When set, indicates that this
                  prefix can be used for on-link determination.

   A              1-bit autonomous address-configuration flag.  When set
                  indicates that this prefix can be used for stateless
                  address configuration.

   Rsv1           3-bit unused field.  It MUST be initialized to zero by
                  the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   SrvTp          3-bit field that specifies the service type.  The
                  field can have the following values:



                  Non-Persistent -   a non-persistent IP prefix (1)

                  Session-Lasting -   a session-lasting IP prefix (2)

                  Fixed -        a fixed IP prefix (3)

                  Graceful-replacement -   a graceful-replacement IP
                                 prefix (4)

   The definition of these service types is available in
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-ondemand-mobility].

   0 is reserved and should not be used.  All other values (5-7) are
   reserved for future use.

   The value of the Service Type indicates the type of continuity
   service committed by the network for the associated IPv6 prefix.

   Once an IPv6 prefix type is provided, any subsequent messages
   involving this prefix (lease renewal - for example) must include the
   IPv6 Continuity Service option with the same service type that was
   assigned by the server during the initial allocation.

   Given the list of IPv6 prefixes and their associated service
   connectivity type, the mobile host can then configure its IP address
   to the appropriate service required by the application

   Mobile hosts that do not support this new option should ignore the
   prefix information option.

   Routers should also send an additional prefix information option
   without the session-type field from time to time for hosts that do
   not support this new format.

3.2.  Adding a new RA option

   The second approach is to add a new RA option alongside the existing
   PIO (and other RA options).  The advantage of this approach are that
   it leaves the existing PIO untouched.  Furthermore, hosts that
   receive this option with the type that they do not understand can
   simply disregard it.

   The new RA option specification is shown in the following figure:


        0                   1                   2                   3
