Abstract


   The IPv6 128-bit address space was designed as a solution for the
   32-bit limitation of IPv4, but deployment of IPv4 in the global
   Internet continues via private addressing domains behind Network
   Address Translators (NATs).  For these reasons, use of IPv6 for end
   node addressing with minimal perturbation of IPv4 networks presents a
   natural long-term transition and coexistence alternative. This
   document proposes IP Virtual Link Extension (IPvLX): a new
   encapsulation method for IPv6 addressing in IPv4 networks.

1.  Introduction


   The IPv6 128-bit address space was designed as a solution for the
   32-bit limitation of IPv4 and offers the promise of scalable end to
   end addressing, but the proliferation of IPv4 in the global Internet
   continues via private addressing domains behind Network Address
   Translators (NATs) [RFC1918][RFC2993]. For these reasons, use of IPv6
   for end node addressing with minimal perturbation of IPv4 networks
   presents a natural long-term transition and coexistence alternative.


   The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol [ISATAP] connects
   IPv6 nodes within a site over an IPv4 network using basic IPv6-in-
   IPv4 encapsulation (i.e., "ISATAP encapsulation") and a virtual link
   abstraction similar to the Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA)
   model [RFC2491][RFC2492].  ISATAP nodes that also implement the IP
   Virtual Link Extension (IPvLX) mechanisms and deployment methods
   described in this document can extend this virtual link to reach
   peers in other enterprises/sites and located many IPv4 hops away.


2.  Terminology


   The terminology of [ISATAP][RFC2460][RFC2461] applies to this
   document. The following additional terms are defined:


   logical interface:
      the same as defined in ([STD3], section 3.3.4.1).


   enterprise:
      a network entity that has one or more connections to the global
      IPv4 Internet and consists of one or more sites.


   site:
      a network entity that determines its own addressing plan and
      address assignments, and is a properly contained within an
      enterprise or parent site.


   virtual link:
      the network span over which packets can be forwarded between peers
      without the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header being decremented.


   IP Virtual Link Extension (IPvLX):
      mechanisms and operational practices (described in this document)
      used by IPvLX nodes to extend the virtual link between peers
      across enterprise/site boundaries.

   IPvLX node:
      an ISATAP node ([ISATAP], section 3) that supports IPvLX. IPvLX
      nodes also serve as IPv6 routers for co-located IPv6 endpoints and
      endpoints on attached IPv6-only links. IPvLX nodes that support
      IPv6 endpoints are IPvLX gateways.


   IPvLX gateway:
      an IPvLX node that provides relaying, proxying, bridging, and/or
      service provisioning capabilities, and determines the addressing
      plans for its associated hosts. Enterprise border IPvLX gateways
      are 6to4 routers [RFC3056].


   associated host:
      an IPvLX node or IPv6-only node that associates with a parent
      IPvLX gateway.  IPvLX nodes that are associated hosts within
      parent sites can also serve as IPvLX gateways for their own
      associated hosts in child sites.


   IPvLX interface:
      an IPvLX node's IPv6 interface that transmits IPvLX Protocol Data
      Units (PDUs) as chains of IPvLX packets using IPvLX encapsulation
      and link adaptation, but otherwise behaves the same as an ISATAP
      interface ([ISATAP], section 3).


   IPvLX Protocol Data Unit (PDU):
      an IPvLX interface's logical unit of transfer that consists of an
      upper layer protocol payload followed by a 32-bit CRC (see:
      section 4.2).


   IPvLX encapsulation:
      a method for encapsulating IPvLX PDUs (or PDU segments) within
      IPv4 headers to create IPvLX packets (see: section 4.1).


   IPvLX packet:
      an IPv4 packet created using IPvLX encapsulation.


   IPvLX link adaptation:
      a link layer mechanism (see: section 4.2) that segments IPvLX PDUs
      into chains of IPvLX packets during encapsulation for later
      reassembly during decapsulation, e.g., to satisfy path MTU
      restrictions, etc.

Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



   IPvLX Flow (or simply: "flow"):
      a unidirectional stream of IPvLX packets identified by a tuple
      consisting of VCI/VPI values, an IPvLX Flow Identifier, and IPv4
      source/destination addresses encoded in each packet header (see:
      sections 4.1 and 4.2). Each flow provides a logical interface for
      IPvLX.


   IPvLX Flow Identifier:
      a 20-bit value encoded in the IPvLX Flow Header and used to
      identify an IPvLX Flow. Similar to the IPv6 Flow Label [RFC3697],
      but may be modified by IPvLX gateways on the path.


   IPvLX Flow Header:
      a 4-byte "Layer 2.5 shim" header immediately following the 20-byte
      IPv4 header in IPvLX packets (see: section 4.1).


   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [BCP14].


3.  Autoconfiguration


   IPvLX nodes should automatically discover the addresses of parent
   IPvLX gateways, enterprise border IPvLX gateways, DNS recursive name
   servers, etc. at startup time or when moving to a new link. They
   should also configure supporting services (e.g., DHCPv4 [RFC2131],
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315][RFC3633][RFC3736], Mobile IPv6 Home Agent [RFC3775],
   etc.)  and advertise the 6to4 Relay anycast prefix ([RFC3068],
   section 2.3) for their associated hosts.


   IPvLX nodes can act as site border IPvLX gateways for their own
   associated hosts to enable recursively-nested "sites within sites",
   with scaling properties limited only by enterprise/site addressing
   plans.


   IPvLX nodes should register name-to-IPv6 address mappings via secure,
   dynamic updates to the DNS [RFC2136][DNSSEC]. (IPvLX nodes that do
   not receive IPv6 address assignments and/or prefix delegations
   through an autoconfiguration mechanism should configure unique local
   addresses [UNIQ1][UNIQ2].)


   IPvLX nodes should provide basic packet forwarding services if
   possible within constraints such as memory, battery power, RF link
   quality, etc.  They should also use efficient dynamic route discovery
   protocols, e.g., a hybrid combination of IETF MANET protocols
   [RFC3561][RFC3626][RFC3684][DSR].  Unification of the MANET protocols
   with existing routing/bridging protocols (e.g., OSPF [RFC2740], IEEE
   802.1D spanning tree [STP], etc.) and an efficient flooding mechanism

   is currently under investigation.


4.  IPvLX Encapsulation


   IPvLX gateways determine the IPv4 addressing plans for their
   associated hosts, which can in turn serve as IPvLX gateways that
   determine the IPv4 addressing plans for their own associated hosts in
   child sites. Since these recursively-nested IPv4 addressing plans may
   be topologically disjoint, IPvLX gateways must rewrite certain packet
   header fields to relay/proxy the packets they forward between sites.
   To support this header rewriting, IPvLX nodes use a special form of
   IPv6-in-IPv4 packet encapsulation ("IPvLX encapsulation") as
   described in the following subsections:


4.1.  IPvLX Packet Header Construction


   IPvLX encapsulation embeds upper layer protocol data in IPv4 headers
   ([RFC0791], Section 3.1) with the value '41' encoded in the
   "Protocol" field and the two least significant bits in the "Flags"
   field both set to '1'. Setting "Flags" bit 0 ("Reserved Fragmentation
   - RF") unambiguously distinguishes IPvLX packets from ordinary
   IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulated packets.  Setting "Flags" bit 1 ("Don't
   Fragment - DF") frees the 13 "Fragment Offset" and 16
   "Identification" bits for use as mutable bits, since IPv4
   fragmentation is disabled and since the IPv4 encapsulation header is
   not included in upper layer pseudo-header checksums. Other IPv4
   header fields are set exactly as in ([MECH], section 3.5).


   IPvLX encapsulation adds a 4-byte IPvLX Flow Header as a "Layer 2.5
   shim" immediately following the 20-byte IPv4 header and immediately
   before the upper layer protocol data. The IPvLX Flow Header is
   formatted as shown below:


   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Version|    Protocol   |         IPvLX Flow Identifier         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Version         4-bit version number - value TBA by IANA.


   Protocol        8-bit protocol number - Identifies the type of
                   header immediately following the IPvLX Flow
                   header using the same values as for the IPv4
                   "Protocol" and IPv6 "Next Header" fields.


   IPvLX Flow ID   20-bit identifier - initialized by the encapsulator
                   (possibly to the same value as the IPv6 Flow Label
                   [RFC3967]) and modified by IPvLX gateways.





Templin, et al.         Expires February 27, 2005               [Page 5]
Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



   When an IPvLX node sends/forwards/receives an IPvLX packet, it treats
   the 16-bit "Identification" field as a 16-bit virtual circuit
   identifier (VCI) and the high-order 8-bits of the "Fragment Offset"
   field as an 8-bit virtual path identifier (VPI). The VCI, VPI and
   IPvLX Flow Identifier are initialized by the encapsulating IPvLX node
   to values that uniquely identify the flow and may modified by
   intermediate IPvLX gateways on the path.


4.2.  IPvLX Interface MTU and IPvLX Link Adaptation


   All IPv6 interfaces are REQUIRED to support the IPv6 minimum MTU of
   1280 bytes, i.e., they MUST NOT return ICMPv6 "Packet too Big" errors
   [RFC1981] for IPv6 packet/fragments smaller than 1280 bytes.
   Interfaces that use IPv4 as a link layer for IPv6 SHOULD also avoid
   unnecessary fragmentation in the IPv4 Internet [FRAG]. IPvLX
   interfaces therefore use a link adaptation layer similar to ATM
   Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) [RFC2684] to segment IPv6 packets/fragments
   into chains of IPvLX packets no larger than an underlying IPv4
   interface's MTU.


   IPvLX link adaptation uses a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) format similar
   to the AAL5 CPCS-PDU ([RFC2684], section 4). The IPvLX PDU consists
   of a Payload field of up to (2^16 - (32 * 4) - 1) = 65407 bytes from
   the original IPv6 packet/fragment to be segmented/reassembled
   followed by a 4 byte CRC. Senders calculate the CRC across all bytes
   of the IPvLX PDU payload using CRC-32 as for AAL5; receivers use the
   CRC to detect and discard PDUs with bit errors.


   The format of the IPvLX PDU is shown below:


                  +-------------------------------+
                  |             .                 |
                  |             .                 |
                  |            Payload            |
                  |        up to 65407 bytes      |
                  |             .                 |
                  |             .                 |
                  +-------------------------------+
                  |         CRC (4 bytes)         |
                  +-------------------------------+


                          IPvLX PDU Format


   IPvLX interfaces configure a default and minimum LinkMTU of 1280
   bytes and MAY configure a larger value up to a maximum of 65407
   bytes; they MUST NOT configure an MTU value outside of this range.

Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



4.2.1.  Segmentation


   IPvLX interfaces configure per-flow link adaptation segment sizes
   ("SEGSIZE") to segment and encapsulate IPvLX PDUs into chains of
   IPvLX packets that include a 20-byte IPv4 header followed by a 4-byte
   IPvLX Flow header followed by up to SEGSIZE PDU bytes. The default
   and minimum per-flow SEGSIZE is 44 bytes.


   IPvLX link adaptation segments each IPvLX PDU into at most 32
   segments and encapsulates each segment in an IPvLX packet header
   (see: section 4.1) to create a chain of IPvLX packets. Beginning with
   the first PDU segment, consecutive segments are encapsulated in-order
   in consecutive IPvLX packets with a Segment ID ("SEGID") between (0 -
   31) encoded in the five low-order bits in the "Fragmentation Offset"
   field in each packet in increasing order, i.e., the first packet
   encodes '0', the second packet encodes '1', etc. up to the final
   packet.


   Each IPvLX packet in a chain sets the "More Fragments - MF" bit as
   for ordinary IPv4 fragmentation (i.e., MF is set for all IPvLX
   packets in the chain except the final one).  The CRC is encoded in
   network byte order as the final 4 PDU bytes in the chain.


   IPvLX packets are formatted as shown below:


                  +-------------------------------+
                  |     IPv4 Header (20 bytes)    |
                  |                               |
                  | RF = DF = 1; MF = [0|1]       |
                  | 0 <= SEGID <= 31              |
                  | 24 < Length <= (24 + SEGSIZE) |
                  |                               |
                  +-------------------------------+
                  |  IPvLX Flow Header (4 bytes)  |
                  +-------------------------------|
                  |                               |
                  ~    Up to SEGSIZE PDU bytes    ~
                  |                               |
                  +-------------------------------+



   IPvLX packets in a chain SHOULD be sent over the wire in increasing
   SEGID order, i.e., SEGID 0 first, followed by SEGID 1, etc., up to
   the final packet in the chain. IPvLX PDUs that are too large to be
   encapsulated within a chain of up to 32 IPvLX packets based on the
   current SEGSIZE for the flow are discarded, and an ICMPv6 "packet too
   big" message [RFC1981] is sent to the source subject to rate-limiting
   ([ICMPV6] section 2.4 f).




Templin, et al.         Expires February 27, 2005               [Page 7]
Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



   IPvLX interfaces MAY configure per-flow SEGSIZE values larger than 44
   bytes, but SHOULD use dynamic probing mechanisms (e.g., sending
   unicast IPvLX encapsulated Router Solicitations and/or sending
   redundant data in IPvLX packets larger than the current SEGSIZE to
   elicit a unicast IPvLX encapsulated Router Advertisement with an MTU
   option that indicates the largest segment received., etc.) to avoid
   path MTU black holes [RFC2923] when larger values are used.


4.2.2.  Reassembly


   The Length, SEGID, MF and IPvLX Flow identification tuples in headers
   of a chain of IPvLX packets provide sufficient information for
   reassembly with protection for minor packet reordering within a flow
   in the IPv4 network.


   Reassembly entails restoration of the original IPvLX PDU based on the
   arrival of a chain of up to 32 IPvLX packets. PDU segments encoded in
   IPvLX packets with SEGID 0 through N are concatenated in numerical
   order (leaving fixed-size holes for any segments that arrive out-of-
   order) until all segments are received or a timeout occurs.


   The last hop IPvLX gateway performs CRC-32 verification over the
   reassembled IPvLX Payload to identify and discard corrupted IPvLX
   PDUs.


   Other reassembly algorithm details [RFC0815] are FFS.


4.3.  IPv6 Fragmentation and Reassembly


   IPv6 endpoints can use host-based IPv6 fragmentation (e.g., by
   setting the "USE_MINIMUM_MTU" socket option [RFC3542]) to avoid
   ICMPv6 "packet too big" messages. Since IPvLX link adaptation
   provides a 32-bit CRC, IPv6 reassembly implementations can provide
   improved robustness and efficiency (e.g., for applications that use
   UDP-Lite [RFC3828]) by replacing any missing IPv6 fragments with
   replicated data from IPv6 fragments received in valid IPvLX packet
   chains rather than discarding the entire packet.


4.4.  Header Compression


   The initial packet for a flow MUST include a full IPv6 header
   ([RFC2460], section 3) to allow IPvLX gateways along the path to the
   destination to initialize flow state. Subsequent packets in the flow
   may omit the IPv6 header and instead encode the same protocol value
   that would have appeared in the IPv6 "Next Header" field in the IPvLX
   Flow Header protocol field.

Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



4.5.  Network Administration Considerations


   The use of IPvLX link adaptation may lead to an overall increase in
   short chains of small packets in the Internet. Network administrators
   are advised to follow the recommendations in [BCP48] to minimize
   packet loss and packet reordering.


4.6.  Network Middlebox Considerations


   Network middleboxes that forward IPvLX packet chains can reassemble
   and re-segment them into different-sized IPvLX packets if they have
   sufficient storage/processing resources to avoid packet loss and can
   deterministically avoid to path MTU black holes.


   Fulfilling these requirements may be possible for middleboxes near
   the "edge" of the network, but much more difficult for interior
   middleboxes. This topic is FFS.


5.  Virtual Link Extension


   When an IPv6 endpoint sends packets toward a target, and an IPv6
   router that forwards the packets over an IPvLX interface occurs along
   the path, the virtual link from the encapsulating IPvLX gateway can
   be extended to a decapsulating IPvLX gateway close to the target as
   follows:


5.1.  From the Encapsulator to the Target's Enterprise/Site Border


   When an intermediate IPvLX gateway along the path from the
   encapsulator to the target's enterprise/site border receives an IPvLX
   packet for a new IPvLX Flow, it creates a flow state entry with a
   lifetime value as specified in [RFC3697]. When it forwards the packet
   into a topologically disjoint IPv4 addressing region, the IPvLX
   gateway also rewrites the IPvLX packet's IPv4 source address to the
   address of the IPv4 interface that will send the packet and rewrites
   the VCI, VPI and IPvLX Flow Identifier to unique values for the new
   IPv4 source and original IPv4 destination addresses.  (The IPv4
   header checksum is also recalculated and rewritten, but the IPv4
   destination address is not rewritten since it already provides the
   topologically-correct address necessary to direct the packet toward
   the target enterprise.)


   Intermediate IPvLX gateway flow state entries store the mapping from:
   (VCI(in), VPI(in), IPvLX Flow Identifier(in), IPv4_src(in),
   IPv4_dst(in)) to: (VCI(out), VPI(out), IPvLX Flow Identifier(out),
   IPv4_src(out), IPv4_dst(out)) during a flow's lifetime. They use the
   mapping to forward both non-initial packets and ICMPv4 error messages
   (see: section 6) for the flow.




Templin, et al.         Expires February 27, 2005               [Page 9]
Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



   The encapsulator stores the flow identification information along
   with the IPv6 source and destination addresses to identify the flow's
   endpoints.


5.2.  From the Target's Enterprise/Site Border to the Decapsulator


   For the initial IPvLX packets for an IPvLX Flow that enter an
   enterprise/site, each intermediate IPvLX gateway along the path
   toward the decapsulator should examine the encapsulated IPv6 packet
   headers and use some form of static/dynamic IPv6 route discovery to
   determine the next hop IPvLX gateway among their associated hosts.
   (Possible route discovery mechanisms include static prefix
   delegations, routes learned via dynamic routing protocols, etc.)
   Intermediate IPvLX gateways should not decapsulate the packet as an
   IPv6 router would do, but instead relay the packet to the next hop
   IPvLX gateway via IPv4, leaving the "Hop Limit" field in the IPv6
   header unchanged. The last hop IPvLX gateway in the path will be an
   IPv6 router before the target that decapsulates the packet.


   To support this relaying, when an intermediate IPvLX gateway along
   the path from the enterprise/site border to the decapsulator receives
   an IPvLX packet for a new IPvLX Flow, it creates a flow state entry
   with a lifetime value as specified in [RFC3697]. When it forwards the
   packet into a topologically disjoint IPv4 addressing region, the
   IPvLX gateway also rewrites the IPv4 destination address to the IPv4
   address of the next hop IPvLX gateway, rewrites the IPv4 source
   address to the address of the IPv4 interface that will send the
   packet, and rewrites the VCI, VPI and IPvLX Flow Identifier to unique
   values for the new IPv4 source and destination addresses. (The IPv4
   header checksum is also recalculated and rewritten.)


   Intermediate IPvLX gateway flow state entries store the mapping from:
   (VCI(in), VPI(in), IPvLX Flow Identifier(in), IPv4_dst(in)) to:
   (VCI(out), VPI(out), IPvLX Flow Identifier(out), IPv4_src(out),
   IPv4_dst(out)) during a flow's lifetime. They use the mapping to
   forward both non-initial packets and ICMPv4 error messages (see:
   section 6) for the flow.


   The decapsulator stores the IPvLX Flow identification information
   along with the IPv6 source and destination addresses to identify the
   flow's endpoints.











Templin, et al.         Expires February 27, 2005              [Page 10]
Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



6.  Error Handling


   IPvLX gateways may receive valid ICMPv4 messages that include an
   outer IPv4 header with the IPv4 source address of the IPv4 node
   reporting the error, an inner IPv4 header from the IPvLX packet-in-
   error, and at least the first 8 bytes of the encapsulated IPv6 packet
   segment.


   When an intermediate IPvLX gateway receives an ICMPv4 message, it can
   determine the previous hop IPvLX gateway based on the flow
   information encoded in the packet-in-error as follows:


       1. Locate a flow state entry that matches the flow information in
          the packet-in-error. If no flow state entry matches, drop the
          ICMPv4 message.


       2. If per-flow rate limiting for the matching flow is exceeded,
          drop the ICMPv4 message.


       3. Perform sanity checks and discard any ICMPv4 error messages
          for which the packet-in-error contains "suspect" information,
          e.g., strange MTU values in ICMPv4 "fragmentation needed"
          messages, strange pointers in ICMPv4 "parameter problem"
          messages, etc.


          Next, rewrite the ICMPv4 message's IPv4 source address to
          IPv4_dst(in) and its IPv4 destination address to IPv4_src(in).
          Also rewrite the packet-in-error's IPv4 source address to
          IPv4_dst(in), its IPv4 destination address to IPv4_src(in),
          its VCI to VCI(in), its VPI to VPI(in), and its IPvLX Flow
          Identifier to IPvLX Flow Identifier(in). Finally, re-calculate
          and rewrite the IPv4 header checksums for both the ICMPv4
          message and the packet-in-error, and forward the message to
          the new IPv4 destination.


   When the first hop IPvLX gateway that encapsulated the original
   packet receives an ICMPv4 message it locates a flow state entry and
   validates the message (subject to rate limiting) as for intermediate
   IPvLX gateways, then uses the flow state information for ICMPv4-to-
   ICMPv6 error translation [RFC2765].


   IPvLX gateways can keep per-flow queues of recently-sent IPvLX packet
   chains with packets larger than 68 bytes for re-segmentation and
   retransmission when a valid ICMPv4 "fragmentation needed" message is
   received, but this may not be possible for some intermediate IPvLX
   gateways due to storage and/or processing limitations.


   IPvLX gateways should discard (and may process as soft errors) any




Templin, et al.         Expires February 27, 2005              [Page 11]
Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



   ICMPv4 messages that cannot be validated. In particular, IPvLX
   gateways should not implement the per-flow queuing method described
   above over any flow for which suspect ICMPv4 "fragmentation needed"
   messages are observed.


7.  Discovering a Parent IPvLX Gateway for the Site


   During IPv4 address autoconfiguration, IPvLX nodes that do not
   connect directly to the global IPv4 Internet should discover an IPv4
   address for a parent IPvLX gateway via, e.g., resolving a Fully-
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in the site's name service (e.g.,
   [LLMNR]), receiving a DHCPv4 option, etc.  IPvLX nodes may instead
   use the 6to4 Relay anycast address ([RFC3068], section 2.4) when no
   other mechanisms are available or when the overhead for using other
   mechanisms is unacceptable.


   Following IPv4 address discovery, IPvLX nodes should next send IPvLX
   encapsulated (*) Router Solicitation messages to verify that the
   parent IPvLX gateway is up and to receive IPv6 autoconfiguration
   parameters.  The Router Solicitation messages should use the
   following addresses:


       -  in the IPv6 source address, a link-local address (preferably a
          link-local [CGA] address)


       -  in the IPv6 destination address, a link-local ISATAP address
          ([ISATAP], section 6.2]) that embeds an IPv4 address for a
          parent IPvLX gateway


       -  in the IPv4 source address, the same as for ([MECH], section
          3.5)


       -  in the IPv4 destination address, the IPv4 address embedded in
          the IPv6 destination address


   When a [CGA] source address is used, the Router Solicitation should
   include SEcure Neighbor Discovery [SEND] parameters for [CGA] proof-
   of-ownership verification.


   When the parent IPvLX gateway receives the Router Solicitation, it
   can send back an IPvLX encapsulated (*) Router Advertisement with the
   following addresses:


       -  in the IPv6 source address, a link-local address (preferably a
          link-local [CGA] address)


       -  in the IPv6 destination address, the IPv6 source address
          received in the Router Solicitation




Templin, et al.         Expires February 27, 2005              [Page 12]
Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



       -  in the IPv4 source address, an equivalent IPv4 unicast address
          ([RFC3068], section 2.6)


       -  in the IPv4 destination address, the IPv4 source address
          received in the Router Solicitation


   When a [CGA] source address is used, the Router Advertisement should
   include SEcure Neighbor Discovery [SEND] parameters for [CGA] proof-
   of-ownership verification. The Router Advertisement should also
   include a SLLAO with an embedded global IPv4 unicast address
   ([RFC2529], section 5) associated with an enterprise border IPvLX
   gateway for the site, i.e., a 6to4 router [RFC3056] for the
   enterprise.


   (*) If the IPvLX gateway does not receive a Router Advertisement in
       response to IPvLX encapsulated Router Solicitations, it should
       instead send ISATAP encapsulated Router Solicitations [ISATAP].
       In that case, link-local ISATAP addresses that embed the
       corresponding IPv4 addresses should be used in Router
       Solicitation/Advertisement messages instead of [CGA] addresses.



8.  Discovering More-Specific Routes


   When an IPv6 endpoint initiates communications with a target, its
   first hop IPvLX gateway resolves the target's Fully-Qualified Domain
   Name (FQDN) using the DNS [RFC1035] or a name service for the site
   (e.g., [LLMNR]). If the name service returns a set of AAAA records
   including one with a 6to4 [RFC3056] address, the first hop IPvLX
   gateway can consider the IPv4 address embedded in the 6to4 prefix as
   the IPv4 destination address for the target node's enterprise border
   IPvLX gateway.


   For target nodes located in other sites/enterprises, the first hop
   IPvLX gateway can then send IPvLX encapsulated IPv6 Router
   Solicitation messages to discover a more-specific route for the
   target [DEFLT] with the following addresses:


       -  in the IPv6 source address, a global (or unique local) [CGA]
          unicast address for the initiating IPv6 endpoint


       -  in the IPv6 destination address, a global (or unique local)
          IPv6 unicast address for the target returned by the name
          service


       -  in the IPv4 source address, the same as for ([MECH], section
          3.5)





Templin, et al.         Expires February 27, 2005              [Page 13]
Internet-Draft                    IPvLX                      August 2004



       -  in the IPv4 destination address, the 6to4-embedded IPv4
          address


   The IPvLX encapsulated IPv6 Router Solicitation should include [SEND]
   parameters for [CGA] proof-of-ownership verification.


   When the final IPvLX gateway before the target receives a Router
   Solicitation, it can perform a reverse name service lookup on the
   IPv6 source address as a means of authenticating the initiator. It
   can then send an IPvLX encapsulated Router Advertisement back toward
   the solicitor with the following addresses:


       -  in the IPv6 source address, a [CGA] link-local address


       -  in the IPv6 destination address, the IPv6 source address from
          the Router Solicitation


       -  in the IPv4 source address, the same as for ([MECH], section
          3.5)


       -  in the IPv4 destination address, the IPv4 source address
          received in the Router Solicitation


   The IPvLX encapsulated IPv6 Router Advertisement should include a
   SLLAO with an embedded global IPv4 unicast address ([RFC2529],
   section 5) associated with an enterprise border IPvLX gateway for the
   target and [SEND] parameters for [CGA] proof-of-ownership
   verification. It should also include as many of the target's IPv6
   addresses as possible in Route Information Options [DEFLT].


   When the solicitor receives a Router Advertisement, it can verify
   that the IPv6 addresses in Route Information Options match the IPv6
   addresses received in AAAA records returned by the name service as a
   means of authorizing the target. This assumes the name service can be
   used as a suitable trust anchor for router authorization without the
   need for ([SEND], section 6) authorization delegation discovery.


   Following authorization, the solicitor can create IPv6 route cache
   entries with the link-local ISATAP address constructed from the IPv4
   address in the Router Advertisement's SLLAO as the next hop toward
   the target's IPv6 addresses, and use IPv6 address selection rules to
   determine the best IPv6 source and destination addresses to choose
   for communications with the target [RFC3484]. The route cache entries
   should be managed in conjunction with name service cache entries,
   i.e., they should be deleted when the lifetime for the corresponding
   name service cache entry expires.

9.  Mobility


   When an IPvLX node moves to a different network point of attachment,
   it will receive new IPv4 autoconfiguration information and discover a
   new parent IPvLX gateway that potentially resides in a different
   enterprise. Upon reattachment, the mobile IPvLX node should send IPv6
   Router Solicitation messages using secure neighbor discovery
   mechanisms [SEND][CGA] to its home enterprise border IPvLX gateway
   (i.e., its home 6to4 router) to update the router's neighbor cache
   and dynamic routing information in any intermediate IPvLX gateways.


   IPv6 nodes can use the features of Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] to support
   movement to foreign enterprises or to different IPv6 prefix regions
   within the home enterprise. The Mobile IPv6 home agent function can
   be deployed on IPvLX gateways to support associated hosts that have
   moved to a different network point of attachment. Whether the binding
   update mechanisms of Mobile IPv6, or ICMPv6 Redirect messages using
   secure neighbor discovery mechanisms [SEND][CGA] should be used to
   provide mobile node location updates to correspondent nodes is FFS.


10.  Analysis of Encapsulation Alternatives


   IPv6 peers that connect to the same physical L2 media segment can use
   native IPv6 directly over the L2 media. Attachment to the same
   physical L2 media segment can be detected based on, e.g., passive
   message snooping, whether/not a neighbor responds to native IPv6
   neighbor discovery messages sent over the L2 media, etc.


   In many cases, IPv6 neighbors will be attached to different physical
   L2 media segments. To avoid issues associated with bridging
   dissimilar media (e.g., path MTU black holes) and to support IPv6
   neighbor discovery security mechanisms, IPvLX nodes should use either
   ISATAP encapsulation or IPvLX encapsulation for sending IPv6 packets
   to neighbors within the same site and use IPvLX encapsulation for
   sending IPv6 packets to neighbors in different sites.


   When legacy NAT boxes that do not support the mechanisms described in
   this document are in the path, IPvLX node should use explicit NAT
   traversal mechanisms (e.g., [TEREDO]) since they provide a lowest-
   common denominator approach supported by most legacy NATs. However,
   the IPv6/UDP/IPv4 encapsulation used by explicit NAT traversal
   mechanisms requires an extra 8 bytes of overhead for each
   encapsulated packet; effectively reducing the segment payload for a
   68 byte encapsulated packet to only 40 bytes.

11.  Security considerations


   IPvLX gateways and associated hosts use the securing mechanisms for
   IPv6 neighbor discovery found in [CGA][SEND] according to the trust
   model appropriate for the given deployment scenario [RFC3756].


   IPvLX gateways and associated hosts use the securing mechanisms for
   IPv6 nodes found in ([NODEREQ], section 8).
