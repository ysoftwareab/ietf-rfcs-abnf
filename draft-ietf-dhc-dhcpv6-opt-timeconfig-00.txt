3. Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in section "Terminology" of the DHCP specification.

4. Network Time Protocol (NTP) Servers option

   The Network Time Protocol Servers option provides a list of one or 
   more IP addresses of NTP [2] servers available to the client. The 
   NTP servers SHOULD be listed in the order of preference.

   The format of the Network Time Protocol Servers option is as shown
   below:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   option-code:   OPTION_NTP_SERVERS (tbd)

   option-len:  Length of the 'NTP server'  fields in octets; It must be
         a multiple of 16

5. IEEE 1003.1 POSIX Timezone option

   The IEEE 1003.1 POSIX Timezone option is used by the server to
   convey client's timezone information to the client.

   The format of the IEEE 1003.1 POSIX Timezone option is:

       0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft    Time Configuration Options for DHCPv6         Feb 2002


   option-code:   OPTION_TIME_ZONE (tbd)

   option-len: Length of the 'time-zone' field in octets

   time-zone:   Time zone of the client in  IEEE 1003.1 POSIX Timezone 
         format [3].
   
   The format of the IEEE 1003.1 POSIX  timezone  string is specified as
   follows:

      StdOffset[Dst[Offset],[Start[/Time],End[/Time]]]

   where '[' and ']' enclose optional fields, '|' indicates choice
   of exactly one of the alternatives, ',' and '/' represent literal
   characters present in the string.

      Std      Three or more octets for the standard timezone (Std).
               Any character (or case) except a leading colon, digits,
               comma, minus or plus sign is allowed.

      Offset   Indicates the value one must add to local time to
               arrive at UTC, of the form:  [+|-]hh[:mm[:ss]].  Offset
               following Std is required.  Digits are always interpreted
               as decimal number.  If preceded by a '-', the timezone is
               east of the Prime Meridian, otherwise it is west ('+' is
               optional) The permissible values for hh[:mm[:ss]] are as
               follows:

                  hh       0 <= hh <= 23

                  mm       0 <= mm <= 60
                  
		  ss       0 <= ss <= 60

               Offset has no default value.

      Dst      Three or more octets for the daylight savings timezone.
               If Dst is missing, then daylight savings time does not
               apply in this locale.  If no Offset follows Dst, then
               Dst is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.
               Any character (or case) except a leading colon, digits,
               comma, minus or plus sign is allowed.

      Start    Indicates the day of the year, in one of the formats
               indicated below, when to change to daylight savings time.
               The ``Time'' field (which follows immediately after a
               ``/'' character, if present) indicates when the change is
               made, in local time.

      End      Indicates the day of the year, in one of the formats
               indicated below, when to change back from daylight
               savings time.  The ``Time'' field (which follows
               immediately after a ``/'' character, if present)
               indicates when the change is made, in local time.

Internet-Draft    Time Configuration Options for DHCPv6         Feb 2002


      Time     Time has the same format as Offset, except that no
               leading ``-'' or ``+'' is permitted.  The default is
               02:00:00.

   The day of the year needs to be given in any of the following 
   formats:

      Jn       The julian day n, (1 <= n <= 365).  Leap days are not
               counted.

      n        Zero-based julian day, (0 <= n <= 365).  Leap days are
               counted so it is possible to refer to Feb 29.

      Mm.n.d   The ``d''th day, (0 <= d <= 6) of week ``n'' of month
               ``m'' of the year (1 <= n <= 5, 1 <= m <= 12, where week
               5 means last ``d'' day in month ``m'' which may occur in
               either the fourth or the fifth week.  Week ``1'' is the
               first week in which the ``d'' day occurs.

   An Example:

   For Eastern USA time zone, 1986, the Posix timezone string is as
   shown below:

      EST5EDT4,116/02:00:00,298/02:00:00

   In this case,  ``5'' is the Offset  for Std, and ``4'' is the  Offset
   for Dst.  Start is the 116th day at 2am, and End is 298th day at 2am.

6. Appearance of these option

   The NTP servers and IEEE 1003.1 POSIX Timezone options MUST appear 
   only in the following messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, 
   Confirm, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request, Reply.

7. Security Considerations

   The NTP servers option may be used by an intruder DHCP server to 
   cause DHCP clients to contact an intruder NTP server, resulting in 
   invalid synchronization of time in client and finally leading to
   time critical applications running inaccurately in client machine.

   The IEEE 1003.1 POSIX Timezone option may be used by an intruder 
   DHCP server to assign invalid time zones, leading to timing issues
   for the applications running on the client machine.

   To avoid attacks through these options, the DHCP client SHOULD use 
   authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" 
   in the DHCPv6 specification [4]).

8. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to these options from the
   option-code space defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of the DHCPv6
   specification [4].
