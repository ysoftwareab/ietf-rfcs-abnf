A Review of Published Criteria for Acceptance Into a Complaint Feedback
                              Loop Program
                draft-jdfalk-marf-acceptance-criteria-00

Abstract

   All known Feedback Generators (the operators of complaint feedback
   loops) have some criteria for acceptance of requests to receive
   feedback.  This document is a review of such criteria, where publicly
   available.  It is intended to inform design decisions within the Mail
   Abuse Reporting Format (MARF) Working Group [MARF-WG], and likely
   will never advance beyond internet-draft status.

   The information included herein was gathered from public web sites.

2.  AOL

   <http://postmaster.info.aol.com/Postmaster.FeedbackLoop.html>

   First, AOL offers subscribers a drop-down list consisting of abuse@,
   postmaster@, and "any other email address listed in the FBL email's
   domain WHOIS record."  A prospective subscriber may choose one of
   these addresses to receive a confirmation message.  The message
   includes a unique URI which, when opened, confirms that the
   subscriber has permission to receive feedback related to that domain.

   Next, AOL attempts to prove ownership of the IP addresses (AOL's
   feedback loop is based on last-hop IP address, not domain.)  For
   this, they require that one of five criteria is met:

   1.  reverse DNS (PTR record) for each IP shares the domain name
       selected in the first step

   2.  at least one authoritative nameserver for each IP shares the
       domain name

   3.  IP WHOIS information for each IP contains the domain

   4.  ASN WHOIS information contains the domain

3.  BlueTie

   BlueTie is perhaps best known as the mailbox provider behind Excite.

   <http://feedback.bluetie.com/>

   Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must
   first select either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a
   confirmation message.  The message includes a unique URI which, when
   opened, confirms that the subscriber has permission to receive
   feedback related to that domain.

   BlueTie has not published additional criteria.

4.  Comcast

   <http://postmaster.comcast.net/feedback-loop.aspx>

   Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must
   first select either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a
   confirmation message.  The message includes a unique URI which, when
   opened, confirms that the subscriber has permission to receive
   feedback related to that domain.

   Comcast also publishes the following criteria:

   o  IPs with a Sender Score [SS] of 60 or above will be accepted.

   o  IPs with a Sender Score of 30 to 60 cannot appear on any DNSBLs.

   o  IP with a Sender Score below 30 will not be approved.

5.  Cox

   <http://postmaster.cox.net/confluence/display/postmaster/
   Feedback+Loop>

   Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must
   first select either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a
   confirmation message.  The message includes a unique URI which, when
   opened, confirms that the subscriber has permission to receive
   feedback related to that domain.

   Cox also publishes the following criteria:

   o  An IP or range with a Sender Score [SS] of 60 or higher will be
      approved.

   o  An IP or range with a Sender Score between 30 and 60 may be
      approved if not listed on any RBLs.

   o  A score of less than 30, or no score due to not enough traffic
      from the IP, will be denied.

6.  Earthlink

   Multiple sources, including [WTTW], report that Earthlink provides
   feedback only to fellow ISPs.  Their specific criteria do not appear
   to be public.

7.  Microsoft

   Microsoft's "Junk Mail Reporting" program covers Hotmail, MSN, and
   Windows Live Mail.

   <https://support.msn.com/
   eform.aspx?productKey=edfsjmrpp&
   page=support_home_options_form_byemail&ct=eformts&scrx=1>

   While Microsoft does not publicize the precise criteria used, some of
   the questions asked by their sign-up form provide some clues:

   o  How would you describe your company or yourself? (multiple choice)

   o  The home page where people sign up for your service

   o  The opt-out link for each list or a link to your organization's
      Privacy Policy

   o  Sender IPs for verification

   o  Are the IP addresses registered under your company's name or
      domain name?

   o  If no, do you have exclusive sending rights from the IP via your
      hosting company (not shared with any other senders)?

   o  Can you remove customers who complain from your lists, or take
      action against spam accounts?

8.  Outblaze

   <http://spamblock.outblaze.com/>

   Word to the Wise [WTTW] reports that Outblaze's complaint feedback
   loop is only available to senders who confirm all subscription
   (opt-in) requests to their lists.  Other sources have reported that
   Outblaze's complaint feedback loop is tied to their whitelisting
   program.  The specifics do not appear to have been publicized.

9.  OpenSRS

   OpenSRS is a mail hosting service operated by Tucows.

   <http://fbl.hostedemail.com/>

   Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must
   first select either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a
   confirmation message.  The message includes a unique URI which, when

   feedback related to that domain.

   Tucows has not published additional criteria.

13.  Yahoo!

   <http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/postmaster/feedback/>

   Yahoo!'s is currently the only known complaint feedback loop where
   complaints are routed based on the [DKIM] d= domain of the offending
   message, rather than last-hop IP address.  Thus, the primary initial
   criteria is that the prospective subscriber sign all their outbound
   mail with DKIM.

   (They do route by IP for ISPs, using unpublished criteria to
   determine whether an ISP qualifies.)

   The signup process requires a free Yahoo! user ID, after which (like
   all feedback loop signup pages hosted by Return Path) the subscriber
   must select either postmaster@ or abues@ their domain to receive a
   confirmation message.  The message includes a unique URI which, when
   opened, confirms that the subscriber has permission to receive
   feedback related to that domain.

   Yahoo! has not published additional criteria.
