Abstract

   IPv4 and IPv6 are expected to coexist for a long period.  Currently,
   there are many IPv4/IPv6 transition/coexistence technologies, which
   can be generally divided into two categories: translation and
   tunneling.  Both translation and tunneling have limitations and
   application scopes.  In some typical transition scenarios, tunneling
   and translation are needed at the same time.  In addition, there may
   be multiple network devices capable of doing translation or tunneling
   along the end-to-end path.  It's important to choose particular
   device(devices) for doing translation or tunneling.

   This draft presents an IPv4-IPv6 transition/coexistence framework
   named PET (short for Prefixing, Encapsulation and Translation).  PET
   is a network side solution which includes fundamental elements needed
   in various transition scenarios.  In PET framework, signaling is
   required for transition devices to exchange necessary information and
   negotiate how to do combine transition and tunneling cooperatively.
   This draft also addresses how to deploy PETs and analyze the
   advantages and disadvantages of typical transition technologies that
   PET may adopt.

Internet-Draft        PET for IPv4/IPv6 Coexistence         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Recently more and more IPv6 networks have been deployed, especially
   IPv6 backbone networks.  Howerver the existing IPv4 networks still
   carry the major network traffic and hold the major network services
   and applications.  It has been a common sense that IPv4 and IPv6
   networks will coexist for a long term.  This leads to the need of
   IPv4-IPv6 coexistance technologies.

   There are many methods proposed for IPv4-IPv6 coexistance, which can
   be roughly classified into two categories: translation and tunneling.
   Translation is a technology that translates the semantic between IPv4
   and IPv6.  Examples of translation methods include SIIT [RFC 2765],
   NAT-PT [RFC 2766], BIS [RFC 2767], SOCKS64 [RFC 3089], BIA [RFC
   3338], IVI [draft-ietf-xli-behave-ivi-02] and so on.  Translation
   technology can realize IPv4 and IPv6 interworking directly; however,
   along with information loss, translation has performance issues.  The
   address mapping in translation mechanism requires either NAT to
   maintain per-mapping state, or IPv6 and IPv4 address space that may
   be translated to be 1:1 in size.  This becomes a problem when the
   network sizes on the side of NAT become large, which is the reason
   Behave WG restrict the scenario with the condition that at least one
   side of the NAT for IPv4-IPv6 translation has to be "a network with a
   clearly identifiable administrative domain" rather than Internet.
   Besides, from the perspective of application layer, per-application
   ALG is required for NAT-traversing. however, it is hard to implement
   ALG in hardware because of the variety of application protocol.

   Tunneling is the technology that encapsulates packets of a different
   protocol within the protocol of the network that delivers it, so as
   to realize forwarding across Incompatible network.  Examples of
   tunneling methods include IP-in-IP tunnel [RFC 2893, RFC 4213], GRE
   tunnel [RFC 1702], 6to4 tunnel [RFC 2893], 6over4 tunnel [RFC 2529],
   softwire transition technology [RFC 5655] and so on.  Tunneling
   technology can not realize the IPv4 and IPv6 interworking; it can
   only deal with the scenario where two IPv4 (IPv6) nodes/networks want
   to communicate with each other through IPv6 (IPv4) network.  However,
   tunneling technology has several advantages.  Besides high
   transparency, it can easily be implemented by hardware, and only
   routing across the transit network is possibly required rather than
   introducing routing information into the network of different address
   family.

   As described above, both translation and tunneling have limitations
   and application scopes.  It's probable that both tunneling and
   translation are required in some scenario.  In addition, when
   there're multiple device capable of doing translation along the
   network path, it's necessary to choose which device(devices) to do

   translation and thus which devices to do tunneling.  Therefore, we
   need to decide proper method for various transition scenarios and how
   translation and tunneling collaborate to solve transition problems.
   This draft presents PET framework for IPv4-IPv6 transition and
   coexistence.  It includes fundamental elements needed in various
   transition scenarios and can work differently on demand.  PET
   requires signaling process to negotiate how to do the transition
   along the end-to-end path and distribute necessary information to
   execute transition technologies.  This procedure is essential for
   compatibility of different technologies and diversity of scenarios.
   In addition, this draft also addresses how to deploy PETs and analyze
   the advantages and disadvantages of all transition methods that PET
   may adopt.

3.  Fundamental elements for IPv4-IPv6 coexistance

   There are mainly two basic IPv4-IPv6 transition scenarios.  One is to
   connect several edge networks of the same address family across a
   transit network of another address family, while the other scenario
   is to enable hosts/network of one address family to directly
   communicate with hosts/network of the other address family.  We call
   the first scenario as heterogeneous crossing and the second as
   heterogeneous direct-connection.  Most IPv4-IPv6 transition scenarios
   can be viewed as the combination of heterogeneous crossing and
   direct-connection.  Generally, heterogeneous crossing can be achieved
   by tunneling or double translation, while heterogeneous direct-
   connection can be achieved by translation.  In order to support
   either tunneling or translation, control plane operations always need
   prefix mappings or prefix announcement.  So there are three
   fundamental elements needed in IPv4-IPv6 coexistance: prefixing,
   encapsulation and translation.

   P: prefixing, which includes all transition operations on control
   plane related to subnet prefix.

   For tunneling technology, prefixing includes prefix announcement,
   tunnel endpoint discovery, tunnel signaling and configuration, et al.
   For example, in Softwire technology, MP-BGP (Multi-protocol BGP) is
   extended to advertise the routing information of E-IP prefix with
   I-IP next-hop, and the parameters of tunnel endpoint before data
   plane forwarding.  Based on this prefixing operation, the auto
   softwire tunnels can be established.  For translation technology,
   prefixing includes address mappings of IPv4/IPv6, prefix
   configuration and announcement.

   E: encapsulation, which includes all tunneling operations on data
   plane, such as encapsulation, decapsulation, maximum transmission
   unit (MTU) processing and so on.  Based on this operation, packets
   from E-IP network are encapsulated and sent across I-IP transit
   network to another E-IP network according to the prefix advertisement
   on control plane.

   T: translation, which includes all translation operations of data
   plane, such as address mapping and protocol translation, MTU
   processing.  Based on address mapping, packets can be translated from
   one address family to another.  Protocol translation is needed since
   IPv4 and IPv6 are not directly compatible.  Here, protocol
   translation includes IP layer translation and application layer
   translation.  To implement translation, PET may need to collaborate
   with the domain name system (DNS), since applications use domain name
   rather than IP address to visit other hosts a lot.

4.  PET Framework

   Based on the above three fundamental elements of IPv4/IPv6
   coexistance, PET is a generic solution for IPv4/IPv6 transition for
   the scenarios of both heterogeneous crossing and direct-connection.
   Figure 1 shows the PET framwork.  We use E-IP and I-IP instead of the
   exact IPv4 and IPv6.  Here I-IP is either IPv4 or IPv6, while E-IP is
   the other address family.  In this framework, the middle I-IP transit
   network is connected with various types of networks including E-IP
   transit/client networks, I-IP transit/client networks and dual stack
   networks.

   Figure 1 PET Framework

   The basic idea of PET framework is to deploy PET boxes between middle
   I-IP transit networks and customer networks (E-IP or I-IP).  PET box
   should support the above basic functions for IPv4/IPv6 coexistance,
   i.e. prefixing, encapsulation and translation.  PET signaling is also
   an essential part of the framework since multiple PET boxes need to
   cooperate with each other.  Through signaling, PET boxes can
   distibute necessary information and negotiate the particular
   functionalities executed on different boxes.  PET signaling will be

   analyzed in the next section.

   We can extract three typical scenarios from Figure 1, including
   "E-IP->I-IP->E-IP", "E-IP->I-IP->I-IP" and "E-IP->E-IP->I-IP"
   (without the loss in genarality, we assume that host in the first
   network initiate the connection).  For different scenarios, PET can
   provide different functionalities to ensure the inter-working of
   E-IP/I-IP network.  We will analyze how PET works in the three
   scenarios in the following subsections.

4.1.  PET operations on E-IP->I-IP->E-IP

   This is the scenario where an E-IP network wants to talk with another
   E-IP network across I-IP transit.  There are two methods PET can
   adopt to handle this scenario.  One is translation and the other is
   tunneling.  If PET uses translation method, it'll need twice
   translations.  An E-IP packet need to be translated by the first PET
   which is I-IP ingress, into an I-IP packet for being delivered
   through I-IP transit.  When this packet arrives at the second PET
   which is I-IP egress, it will be translated back into an E-IP packet
   for being delivered in destination E-IP network.

   The other method for E-IP-I-IP-E-IP scenario is tunneling.  This
   requires a PET to encapsulate the packets and send them to the other
   tunnel endpoint PET across I-IP transit.  When these packets arrive
   at the second PET, they are decapsulated and sent to E-IP customer
   network.

   Because translation method will bring heavier load because of address
   mapping and protocal translation, PET prefers to use tunneling
   technology to handle E-IP-I-IP-E-IP scenario.  Its operations are
   shown in Figure 2.

4.2.  PET operations on E-IP->I-IP->I-IP

   This is the scenario where an E-IP customer network wants to talk
   with an I-IP customer network across I-IP transit.  There are two
   methods to deal with this scenario.  One is translation plus
   forwarding (Figure 3).  The other is tunneling plus translation
   (Figure 4).

   In the first method, when an E-IP packet arrives at the first
   PET(IPv4-IPv6 edge), it will be translated into an I-IP packet and
   then sent to the I-IP client network through I-IP transit.  In the
   second method, when an E-IP packet arrives at the first PET, it will
   be encapsulated as an I-IP packet for being delivered through I-IP
   transit.  Once this packet arrives at the other tunnel endpoint PET,
   it will be decapsulated to the original E-IP packet and then be
   translated into an I-IP packet to deliver to the I-IP customer
   network.

   Both method works in theory, though the second method seems more
   complicated; however the key factor here is that translation brings
   heavy load, so the two related PET box need a singaling process to
   negotiate which one of them to do the translation, i.e. which method
   to use.  In principle, it's better that translation is done by the
   PET whose performance is better and the sizes of the networks on the
   side of which is smaller.  We'll discuss PET signaling in the next
   section.

4.3.  PET operations on E-IP->E-IP->I-IP

   This is the scenario where an E-IP customer network wants to talk
   with an I-IP customer network across E-IP transit.  There are two
   methods to deal with this scenario.  One is forwarding plus
   translation.  The other is translation plus tunneling.

   In the first method, when an E-IP packet arrives at the first PET, it
   will be directly delivered to E-IP transit.  At the edge of
   E-IP-I-IP, i.e. the second PET, the packet will be translated into an
   I-IP packet for delivering in I-IP customer network.  In the second
   meothod, when an E-IP packet arrives at the first PET, it will be
   translated into an I-IP packet, and then PET encapsulates it and
   sends it to the second PET.  When the E-IP packet encapsulating the
   translated I-IP packet arrives at the second PET, the I-IP packet
   will be decapsulated and sent to the I-IP customer network.

   Here both methods works,too.  We also require PET signaling to
   negotiate which PET to do translation.

5.  PET signaling

   We can see from section 4 that translation is inevitably adopted in a
   lot typical scenarios while it's clear that translation technology
   has performance and scalability issues.  So it's important that
   translation is done on a proper PETwhen necessary.  The principle
   here is that PET box whose performance is better and the sizes of the
   networks on the side of which is smaller, is preferred to do
   translation.

   Here we propose a new concept called Translation Preference (TP) to
   express the PET's willing of performing translation according to some
   policies the network administrators constitute.  Through exchanging
   the Translation preference among PETs, PET framework can choose which
   PET to do translation and decide the communication mode for
   corresponding scenarios.  TP can be decided by the performance of PET
   box, the size of networks which PET is connected to, and the
   administrators' policy.  We define the value of TP as the preference
   degree that the PET would like to translate a packet; the higher the
   TP value is, the higher probability the PET translates packets.

   Besides TP, there is another type of information that PETs would
   wants to exchange when translation is used, we call it PET prefix.
   PET prefix represents the prefix of network the PET box charges.
   Based on that other PETs can differentiate an IPv6 mapped address
   from a regular IPv6 address, thus learn about the source or
   desitination of a packet.  For example, in a IPv6-IPv6-IPv4 scenario,
   PET can announce a /96 prefix in signaling to express that all the
   IPv6 address within the prefix is a mapped IPv6 address for a IPv4
   host; if the address mapping is done through add/remove IPv6 prefix,
   then PET learns how to do address mapping based on this information.

   PET may need to exchange more infomation or do other negotiations in
   the future, we can use the signaling process to achieve it as long as
   it's necessary.  We won't define how to do PET signaling for TP and
   PET prefix exactly and how the message formats should be in this
   draft, but we believe that this signaling process should be done by
   softwire signaling process through a slight extension of MP-BGP.

6.  Implementation issues

   In this draft, we recommend how to use tunneling and translation
   method in each scenario using PET.  However, we do not restrict the
   specific tunneling and translation technology that PET adopts.  It
   can be any transition technology, such as SIIT [RFC 2765], NAT-PT
   [RFC2766], BIS [RFC 2767], SOCKS64 [RFC 3089], BIA [RFC 3338],
   IVI[draft-ietf-xli-behave-ivi-02], IP-in-IP tunnel [RFC 2893, RFC
   4213],GRE tunnel [RFC 1702], 6to4 tunnel [RFC 2893], 6over4 tunnel
   [RFC2529], softwire transition technology [RFC 5565] and so on.

6.1.  DNS consideration

   It's a concern how to make PET collaborate with DNS system.  In the
   translation schemes proposed lately, DNS is usually considered
   because hosts use domain names rather than IP address directly to
   visit other hosts a lot.  Generally the DNS query strategy of these
   schemes can be divided into two types.  The first method is to build
   a DNS ALG on the NAT and make all the DNS query and reply go through
   the NAT; the second method is to use DNS64 as a extended DNS server
   which collaborate with NAT to do the DNS translating.  PET which may
   use these translation mechanisms introduces a slight change in that
   the PET box doing the translation may be not the PET box that is in
   the IPv4-IPv6 edge, so it's a little complicated.  PET boxes may need
   to remember the DNS server address behind the other PET boxes.
   However, the influence of PET using these translation schemes on DNS
   varies among different schemes, so we won't discuss it one by one in
   this framework.
