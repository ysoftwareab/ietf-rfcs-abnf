1.  Introduction

   Defining syntax for new HTTP fields ([HTTP], Section 5) is non-
   trivial.  Among the commonly encountered problems are:

   *  There is no common syntax for complex field values.  Several well-
      known fields do use a similarly looking syntax, but it is hard to
      write generic parsing code that will both correctly handle valid
      field values but also reject invalid ones.

   *  The HTTP message format allows field lines to repeat, so field
      syntax needs to be designed in a way that these cases are either
      meaningful, or can be unambiguously detected and rejected.

   *  HTTP does not define a character encoding scheme ([RFC6365],
      Section 2), so fields are either stuck with US-ASCII ([RFC0020]),
      or need out-of-band information to decide what encoding scheme is
      used.  Furthermore, APIs usually assume a default encoding scheme
      in order to map from octet sequences to strings (for instance,
      [XMLHttpRequest] uses the IDL type "ByteString", effectively
      resulting in the ISO-8859-1 character encoding scheme [ISO-8859-1]
      being used).

   (See Section 16.3 of [HTTP] for a summary of considerations for new
   fields.)

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values        April 2021


   This specification addresses the issues listed above by defining both
   a generic JSON-based ([RFC8259]) data model and a concrete wire
   format that can be used in definitions of new fields, where the goals
   were:

   *  to be compatible with field recombination when field lines occur
      multiple times in a single message (Section 5.3 of [HTTP]), and

   *  not to use any problematic characters in the field value (non-
      ASCII characters and certain whitespace characters).

1.1.  Relation to "Structured Field Values for HTTP" ([RFC8941])

   "Structured Field Values for HTTP", an IETF RFC on the Standards
   Track, is a different approach to this set of problems.  It uses a
   more compact notation, similar to what is used in existing header
   fields, and avoids several potential interoperability problems
   inherent to the use of JSON.

   In general, that format is preferred for newly defined fields.  The
   JSON-based format defined by this document might however be useful in
   case the data that needs to be transferred is already in JSON format,
   or features not covered by "Structured Field Values" are needed.

   See Appendix A for more details.

2.  Data Model and Format

   In HTTP, field lines with the same field name can occur multiple
   times within a single message (Section 5.3 of [HTTP]).  When this
   happens, recipients are allowed to combine the field line values
   using commas as delimiter, forming a combined "field value".  This
   rule matches nicely JSON's array format (Section 5 of [RFC8259]).
   Thus, the basic data model used here is the JSON array.

   Field definitions that need only a single value can restrict
   themselves to arrays of length 1, and are encouraged to define error
   handling in case more values are received (such as "first wins",
   "last wins", or "abort with fatal error message").

   JSON arrays are mapped to field values by creating a sequence of
   serialized member elements, separated by commas and optionally
   whitespace.  This is equivalent to using the full JSON array format,
   while leaving out the "begin-array" ('[') and "end-array" (']')
   delimiters.

   The ABNF character names and classes below are used (copied from
   [RFC5234], Appendix B.1):

     CR               = %x0D    ; carriage return
     HTAB             = %x09    ; horizontal tab
     LF               = %x0A    ; line feed
     SP               = %x20    ; space
     VCHAR            = %x21-7E ; visible (printing) characters

   Characters in JSON strings that are not allowed or discouraged in
   HTTP field values - that is, not in the "VCHAR" definition - need to
   be represented using JSON's "backslash" escaping mechanism
   ([RFC8259], Section 7).

   The control characters CR, LF, and HTAB do not appear inside JSON
   strings, but can be used outside (line breaks, indentation etc.).
   These characters need to be either stripped or replaced by space
   characters (ABNF "SP").

   Formally, using the HTTP specification's ABNF extensions defined in
   Section 5.6.1 of [HTTP]:

     json-field-value = #json-field-item
     json-field-item  = JSON-Text
                      ; see [RFC8259], Section 2,
                      ; post-processed so that only VCHAR characters
                      ; are used

3.  Sender Requirements

   To map a JSON array to an HTTP field value, process each array
   element separately by:

   1.  generating the JSON representation,

   2.  stripping all JSON control characters (CR, HTAB, LF), or
       replacing them by space ("SP") characters,

   3.  replacing all remaining non-VSPACE characters by the equivalent
       backslash-escape sequence ([RFC8259], Section 7).

   The resulting list of strings is transformed into an HTTP field value
   by combining them using comma (%x2C) plus optional SP as delimiter,
   and encoding the resulting string into an octet sequence using the
   US-ASCII character encoding scheme ([RFC0020]).

3.1.  Example

   With the JSON data below, containing the non-ASCII characters "ü"
   (LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS, U+00FC) and "€" (EURO SIGN,
   U+20AC):

   [
     {
       "destination": "Münster",
       "price": 123,
       "currency": "€"
     }
   ]

   The generated field value would be:

   { "destination": "M\u00FCnster", "price": 123, "currency": "\u20AC" }

4.  Recipient Requirements

   To map a set of HTTP field line values to a JSON array:

   1.  combine all field line values into a single field value as per
       Section 5.3 of [HTTP],

   2.  add a leading begin-array ("[") octet and a trailing end-array
       ("]") octet, then

   3.  run the resulting octet sequence through a JSON parser.

   The result of the parsing operation is either an error (in which case
   the field values needs to be considered invalid), or a JSON array.

4.1.  Example

   An HTTP message containing the field lines:

   Example: "\u221E"
   Example: {"date":"2012-08-25"}
   Example: [17,42]

   would be parsed into the JSON array below:

   [
     "∞",
     {
       "date": "2012-08-25"
     },
     [
       17,
       42
     ]
   ]

5.  Using this Format in Field Definitions

   Specifications defining new HTTP fields need to take the
   considerations listed in Section 16.3 of [HTTP] into account.  Many
   of these will already be accounted for by using the format defined in
   this specification.

   Readers of HTTP-related specifications frequently expect an ABNF
   definition of the field value syntax.  This is not really needed
   here, as the actual syntax is JSON text, as defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC8259].

   A very simple way to use this JSON encoding thus is just to cite this
   specification - specifically the "json-field-value" ABNF production
   defined in Section 2 - and otherwise not to talk about the details of
   the field syntax at all.

   An alternative approach is just to repeat the ABNF-related parts from
   Section 2.

   This frees the specification from defining the concrete on-the-wire
   syntax.  What's left is defining the field value in terms of a JSON
   array.  An important aspect is the question of extensibility, e.g.
   how recipients ought to treat unknown field names.  In general, a
   "must ignore" approach will allow protocols to evolve without
   versioning or even using entire new field names.

6.  Deployment Considerations

   This JSON-based syntax will only apply to newly introduced fields,
   thus backwards compatibility is not a problem.  That being said, it
   is conceivable that there is existing code that might trip over
   double quotes not being used for HTTP's quoted-string syntax
   (Section 5.6.4 of [HTTP]).

7.  Interoperability Considerations

   The "I-JSON Message Format" specification ([RFC7493]) addresses known
   JSON interoperability pain points.  This specification borrows from
   the requirements made over there:

7.1.  Encoding and Characters

   This specification requires that field values use only US-ASCII
   characters, and thus by definition uses a subset of UTF-8
   (Section 2.1 of [RFC7493]).





Reschke                  Expires 24 October 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values        April 2021


   Furthermore, escape sequences in JSON strings (Section 7 of
   [RFC8259]) - both in object member names and string values - are not
   allowed to represent non-Unicode code points such as unpaired
   surrogates or Noncharacters (see "General Structure" in [UNICODE]).

7.2.  Numbers

   Be aware of the issues around number precision, as discussed in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC7493].

7.3.  Object Constraints

   As described in Section 4 of [RFC8259], JSON parser implementations
   differ in the handling of duplicate object names.  Therefore, senders
   are not allowed to use duplicate object names, and recipients are
   advised to either treat field values with duplicate names as invalid
   (consistent with [RFC7493], Section 2.3) or use the lexically last
   value (consistent with [ECMA-262], Section 24.3.1.1).

   Furthermore, ordering of object members is not significant and can
   not be relied upon.

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   In current versions of HTTP, field values are represented by octet
   sequences, usually used to transmit ASCII characters, with
   restrictions on the use of certain control characters, and no
   associated default character encoding, nor a way to describe it
   ([HTTP], Section 5).

   This specification maps all characters which can cause problems to
   JSON escape sequences, thereby solving the HTTP field
   internationalization problem.

   Future specifications of HTTP might change to allow non-ASCII
   characters natively.  In that case, fields using the syntax defined
   by this specification would have a simple migration path (by just
   stopping to require escaping of non-ASCII characters).

9.  Security Considerations

   Using JSON-shaped field values is believed to not introduce any new
   threads beyond those described in Section 12 of [RFC8259], namely the
   risk of recipients using the wrong tools to parse them.

   Other than that, any syntax that makes extensions easy can be used to
   smuggle information through field values; however, this concern is
   shared with other widely used formats, such as those using parameters
   in the form of name/value pairs.

                                 Table 1

   Structured Fields provide more data types (such as "token" or "byte
   sequence").  Numbers are restricted, avoiding the JSON interop
   problems described in Section 7.2.  Strings are limited to ASCII,
   requiring the use of byte sequences should non-ASCII characters be
   needed.

A.2.  Structures

   Structured Fields define Lists ([RFC8941], Section 3.1), similar to
   JSON arrays ([RFC8259], Section 5), and Dictionaries ([RFC8941],
   Section 3.2), similar to JSON objects ([RFC8259], Section 4).

   In addition, most items in Structured Fields can be parametrized
   ([RFC8941], Section 3.1.2), attaching a dictionary-like structure to
   the value.  To emulate this in JSON based field, an additional
   nesting of objects would be needed.

   Finally, nesting of data structures is intentionally limited to two
   levels (see Appendix A.1 of [RFC8941] for the motivation).

Appendix B.  Use of JSON Field Value Encoding in the Wild

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values        April 2021


   Since work started on this document, various specifications have
   adopted this format.  At least one of these moved away after the HTTP
   Working Group decided to focus on [RFC8941] (see thread starting at
   <https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-
   wg/2016OctDec/0505.html>).

   The sections below summarize the current usage of this format.

B.1.  W3C Reporting API Specification

   Defined in W3C Working Draft "Reporting API" (Section 3.1 of
   [REPORTING]).  Still in use in latest working draft dated September
   2018.

B.2.  W3C Clear Site Data Specification

   Used in earlier versions of "Clear Site Data".  The current version
   replaces the use of JSON with a custom syntax that happens to be
   somewhat compatible with an array of JSON strings (see Section 3.1 of
   [CLEARSITE] and <https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-
   wg/2017AprJun/0214.html> for feedback).

B.3.  W3C Feature Policy Specification

   Originally defined in W3C document "Feature Policy" ([FEATUREPOL]),
   but switched to use of Structured Header Fields ([RFC8941]).

Appendix C.  Implementations

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   See <https://github.com/reschke/json-fields> for a proof-of-concept
   (in development).

Appendix D.  Change Log

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

D.1.  Since draft-reschke-http-jfv-00

   Editorial fixes + working on the TODOs.

D.2.  Since draft-reschke-http-jfv-01

   Mention slightly increased risk of smuggling information in header
   field values.

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values        April 2021


D.3.  Since draft-reschke-http-jfv-02

   Mention Kazuho Oku's proposal for abbreviated forms.

   Added a bit of text about the motivation for a concrete JSON subset
   (ack Cory Benfield).

   Expand I18N section.

D.4.  Since draft-reschke-http-jfv-03

   Mention relation to KEY header field.

D.5.  Since draft-reschke-http-jfv-04

   Between June and December 2016, this was a work item of the HTTP
   working group (see <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-
   httpbis-jfv/>).  Work (if any) continues now on
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-reschke-http-jfv/>.

   Changes made while this was a work item of the HTTP Working Group:

D.6.  Since draft-ietf-httpbis-jfv-00

   Added example for "Accept-Encoding" (inspired by Kazuho's feedback),
   showing a potential way to optimize the format when default values
   apply.

D.7.  Since draft-ietf-httpbis-jfv-01

   Add interop discussion, building on I-JSON and ECMA-262 (see
   <https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/225>).

D.8.  Since draft-ietf-httpbis-jfv-02

   Move non-essential parts into appendix.

   Updated XHR reference.

D.9.  Since draft-reschke-http-jfv-05

   Add meat to "Using this Format in Header Field Definitions".

   Add a few lines on the relation to "Key".

   Summarize current use of the format.

   Update note about FEATUREPOL (now using Structured Fields).

   Reference [HTTP] instead if RFC723* and adjust (header) field
   terminology accordingly.

   Remove discussion about the relation to KEY (as that spec is dormant:
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-key/>).

   Remove appendices "Examples" and "Discussion".

   Mark "Use of JSON Field Value Encoding in the Wild" for removal in
   RFC.
