                    PIM Signaling Through BIER Core
                    draft-ietf-bier-pim-signaling-03

Abstract  

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that
   provides multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without
   requiring intermediate routers to maintain multicast related per-flow
   state.  Neither does BIER require an explicit tree-building protocol
   for its operation.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER domain at a
   "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain at
   one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs).  The BFIR router
   adds a BIER header to the packet.  Such header contains a bit-string
   in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet
   to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be
   forwarded is expressed by the according set of bits switched on in
   BIER packet header.

   This document describes the procedure needed for PIM Joins and Prunes
   to be signaled through a BIER core. Allowing PIM routers to run
   traditional PIM multicast services through a BIER core.

1. Introduction

   Consider large networks deploying traditional PIM multicast service.
   Typically, each portion of these large networks have their own
   mandates and requirements. 

   It might be desirable to deploy BIER technology in some part of these
   networks to replace traditional PIM services. In such cases
   downstream PIM states need to be signaled over BIER Domain toward the
   source.

   This draft explains the procedure to signal PIM joins and prunes
   through a BIER Domain, as such enable provisioning of traditional pim
   services through a BIER Domain.

                     Figure 1: bier boundary router

   As per figure 1, the procedures of PIM signaling is done at the BIER
   boundary router. The BIER boundary router (BBR) are connected to PIM
   capable routers toward the pim domain and BIER routers toward the
   bier domain. PIM routers in pim domain continue to send PIM state
   messages to the BBR. The BBR will create pim adjacency between all
   the PIM routers attach to it on the pim domain. That said the BBR
   does not propagate all PIM packets natively into the BIER domain.
   Instead when it determines that the PIM join or prune messages needs
   to be signaled through the BIER domain it will tunnel the PIM packet
   through the BIER network. This tunneling is only done for signaling
   purposes and not for creating a PIM adjacency between the two
   disjoint pim domains through the bier domain. 

   The terminology ingress BBR (ibbr) and egress BBR (ebbr) are relative
   from signaling point of view.

   The ingress BBR will determine if an arriving pim join or prune needs

   to be signaled across the bier domain. While the egress BBR will
   determine if the arriving bier packet is a signaling packet and if so
   it will generate a pim signaling packet toward its attach pim domain.

   The BFER and BFIR are BBR from datapath point of view. It should be
   noted the new procedures in this draft are only applicable to
   signaling and there are no changes from datapath point of view. 



3.1. Ingress BBR procedure


   IBBR will create pim adjacency to all pim routers attach to it toward
   the pim domain.

   When a PIM join or prune for certain (S,G) arrives, the IBBR first
   determines weather the join or prune is meant for a source that is
   reachable through the bier domain. As an example, this source is
   located on a disjoint PIM domain that is reachable through the BIER
   domain. If so the ibbr will try to resolve the source via an ebbr
   closest to the source. 

   The procedure to find the ebbr (BFIR from datapath point of view) can
   be via many mechanisms explained in more detail in upcoming section. 

   After discovering the EBBR and its BFR-ID (flooded via IGP BIER
   extension), the IBBR will construct the BIER header. The signaling
   packet, in this case the PIM join/prune packet, is encapsulated in
   the BIER header and transported through BIER domain to EBBR. 

   The IBBR will track all the PIM interfaces on the attach pim domain
   which are interested in a certain (S,G). It creates multicast states
   for arriving (S,G)s from pim domain, with incoming interface as BIER
   "tunnel" interface and outgoing interface as the pim domain
   interface(s) on which PIM Join(s) were received on.

3.1.1. Determining EBBR on IBBR

   As it was explained in previous section, IBBR needs to determine the
   EBBR closest to the source. This is needed to encode the BIER header
   BitString field to forward the signaling packet through the BIER
   domain.

   It should be noted, the PIM domains can be either part of the same
   IGP area as BIER domain(single area) or are stitched to the BIER
   domain via an ABR or ASBR routers. As such on IBBR, there can be many
   different procedures to determine the EBBR. Some examples of these

   procedures have been provided in Appendix A. 

3.1.4. BIER packet construction at IBBR

   The BIER header will be encoded with the BFR-id of the IBBR(with
   appropriate bit set in the bitstring) and the PIM signaling packet is
   then encapsulated in the packet.

   BIERHeader.Proto = IPv4 or IPv6 

   BIERHeader.BitString= Bit corresponding to the BFR-ID of the EBBR

   BIERHeader.BFIR-id = BFR-Id of the BER originating the encapsulated
   PIM packet, i.e. the IBBR.

   Rest of the values in the BIER header are determined based on the
   network (MPLS/non-MPLS), capabilities (BSL), and network
   configuration.


3.2. Signaling PIM through the BIER domain procedure

   Throughout the BIER domain the BIER forwarding procedure is in par
   with RFC 8279. No BIER router will examine the BIER packet
   encapsulating the PIM signaling packet. As such there is no multicast
   state build in the BIER domain.

   The packet will be forwarded through the BIER domain until it reaches
   the BER with matching BFR-ID as in the BIERHeader.Bitstring. EBBR
   will remove the BIER header and examine the PIM IPv4 or IPv6
   signaling packet farther as per EBBR Procedure section.

3.3. EBBR procedure
 


Bidgoli, Xu et al.     Expires December 23, 2018                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      PIM Stitching Through BIER Core        June 21, 2018


   After receiving the BIER packet and determining this packet is a
   signaling packet, EBBR will remove the BIER header from PIM packet.
   It will do a route lookup for the source of the pim signaling packet.
   If the source is on a locally attach pim domain, it forwards the PIM
   packet toward the source.

   With same token the EBBR creates a multicast state with incoming
   interface as same interface that PIM join packet was forwarded and
   outgoing interfaces of BIER tunnel with BIER-Header.BFIR-id and its
   corresponding Sub-Domain as one of the BFER of the tunnel.

   The EBBR will also build a forwarding table for the arriving (S,G)
   using the BIERHeader.BFIR-id and the Sub-Domain they arrived on, in
   short it tracks all IBBRs interested in this (S,G). This is explained
   in section 4.1.

   It should be noted EBBR will maintain PIM adjacency toward the PIM
   domain and all PIM routers which are connected to it. 

   At this point the end-to-end multicast traffic flow setup is
   complete.


4. Datapath Forwarding

4.1. BFIR tracking of (S,G)

   For a specific Source and Group, BFIR (EBBR)should track all the
   interested BFERs (IBBRs) via arriving PIM signaling from BIER Domain.
   BFIR should build its multicast tree with incoming interface (IIF) as
   PIM interface (in PIM domain) and out going interfaces OIFs set as
   the <SD, BFR-ID> of the interested BFERs (in BIER Domain). 

4.2. Datapath traffic flow

   When the multicast data traffic arrives on the BFIR (EBBR) the router
   will find all the interested BFERs for that specific (S,G). The
   router then constructs the BIERHeader.BitString with all the BFER
   interested in the group and will forward the packet to the BIER
   domain. The BFER(s) will accept the packets and remove the BIER
   header and forward the multicast packet as per pre-build multicast
   state for (G) and its outgoing interfaces. 

5. PIM-ASM behavior

   In case of PIM ASM the procedure for LEAFs joining RP is same as
   above. It should be noted that for ASM, the EBBR is determined with
   respect to the RP instead of the source.

6. Applicability to MVPN

   With just minor changes, the above procedures apply to MVPN as well,
   with BFIR/BFER/EBBR/IBBR being VPN PEs.

   All the PIM related procedures, and the determination of EBBR happens
   in the context of a VRF, following procedures for PIM-MVPN.

   When a PIM packet arrives from PIM domain attached to the vrf (IBBR),
   and it is determine that the source is reachable via the vrf through
   the BIER domain, a PIM signaling message is sent via BIER to the
   EBBR. In this case usually the PE terminating the PIM-MVPN is the
   EBBR. A label is imposed before the BIER header is imposed, and the
   "proto" field in the BIER header is set to 1 (for "MPLS packet with
   downstream-assigned label at top of stack"). The label is advertised
   by the EBBR/BFIR to associate incoming packets to its correct VRF. In
   many scenarios a label is already bound to the VRF loopback address
   on the EBBR/BFIR and it can be used.

   When a multicast data packet is sent via BIER by an EBBR/BFIR, a
   label is imposed before the BIER packet is imposed, and the "proto"
   field in the BIER header is set to 1 (for "MPLS packet with
   downstream-assigned label at top of stack"). The label is assigned to
   the VPN consistently on all VRFs [draft-zzhang-bess-mvpn-evpn-
   aggregation-label].

   If the more complicated label allocation scheme is needed for the
   data packets as specified in [draft-zzhang-bess-mvpn-evpn-
   aggregation-label], then additional PMSI signaling is needed as
   specified in [RFC6513].

   To support per-area subdomain in this case, the ABRs would need to
   become VPN PEs and maintain per-VPN state so it is unlikely
   practical.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document contains no actions for IANA.

8. Security Considerations

   The procedures of this document do not, in themselves, provide
   privacy, integrity, or authentication for the control plane or the
   data plane. For a discussion of the security considerations regarding
   the use of BIER, please see RFC8279 and RFC8296. Security
   considerations regarding PIM protocol is based on RFC4601.

Appendix A

   This section provides some examples and routing procedures that can
   be used to determine the EBBR on IBBR. It should be noted, the PIM
   domains can be either part of the same IGP area as BIER domain(single
   area) or are stitched to the BIER domain via an ABR or ASBR routers.
   As such on IBBR, there can be many different procedures to determine
   the EBBR. Not all procedures are listed below.   

A.1. SPF

   On IBBR SPF procedures can be used to find the EBBR closest to the
   source.

   Assuming the BIER domain is consist of all BIER forwarding routers,
   SPF calculation can identify the router advertising the prefix for
   the source. A post process can find the EBBR by walking from the
   advertising router back to the IBBR in the reverse direction of
   shortest path tree branch until the first BFR is encountered.

A.2. Indirect next-hop

   Alternatively, the route to the source could have an indirect next-
   hop that identifies the EBBR. These methods are explained in the
   following sections.

A.2.1. Static Route

   On IBBR there can be a static route configured for the source, with
   source next-hop set as EBBR BIER prefix. 

A.2.2. Interior Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP)

   Consider the following topology:

                      bbr                   bbr
                      ebbr                  ibbr
        |--pim Domain--|-----bier domain-----|--pim domain--| 
   S--( A )----------( B ) ---- ( C ) ---- ( D )----------( E )--h


                             Figure 2

   Suppose BGP is enable between EBBR (B) and IBBR (D) and the PIM
   Domain routes are redistributed to the BIER domain via BGP. This
   would include the Multicast Source IP address (S), which resides in
   the PIM Domain. In such case BGP should use the same loopback
   interface as its next-hop as the BBR prefix. This will ensure that
   all PIM domain routes, including the Multicast Source IP address (S)
   are resolve via BBR's bier prefix id as thier next-hop. When the host
   (h) triggers a PIM join message to IBBR (D), IBBR tries to resolve
   (S). It resolves (S) via BGP installed route and realizes its next-
   hop is EBBR (B). IBBR will use this next-hop (B) to find its
   corresponding BIER bit index. 

   This procedure is inline with RFC6826 mLDP in-band signaling section
   2.     

A.3. Inter-area support

   If each area has its own BIER sub-domain, the above procedure for
   post-SPF could identify one of the ABRs and the EBBR. If a sub-domain
   spans multiple areas, then additional procedures as described in A.2
   is needed.

A.3.1. Inter-area Route summarization

   In a multi-area topology, a BIER sub-domain can span a single area.
   Suppose this single area is constructed entirely of Bier capable
   routers and the ABRs are the BIER Boundary Routers attaching the BIER
   sub-domain in this area to PIM domains in adjacent areas. These BBRs
   can summarize the PIM domain routes via summary routes, as an example
   for OSPF, a type 3 summary LSAs can be used to advertise summary
   routes from a PIM domain area to the BIER area. In such scenarios the

   IBBR can be configured to look up the Source via IGP database and use
   the summary routes and its Advertising Router field to resolve the
   EBBR. The IBBR needs to ensure that the IGP summary route is
   generated by a BFR. This can be achieved by ensuring that bier sub-
   tlv exists for this route. If multiple BBRs (ABRs) have generated the
   same summary route the lowest Advertising Router IP can be selected
   or a vendor specific hashing algorithm can select the summary route
   from one of the BBRs.
