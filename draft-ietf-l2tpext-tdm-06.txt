1. Introduction 
    
   This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 
   Version 3(L2TPv3) for support of structure-agnostic [RFC4553] and 
   structure-aware [RFC5086] TDM pseudowires. Structure-agnostic 
   encapsulation of TDM bit-streams over L2TPv3 is described in 
   [RFC4553], Figure 2b, and structure-aware encapsulation - in 
   [RFC5086], Figures 1c (TDM data packets) and 4a (CE application 
   signaling packets). However, the order of the CESoPSN Control Word 
   (CW) and RTP header (if it is used) MUST match between the TDM data 
   and CE signaling packets. 
    
   Setup of structure-aware TDM pseudowires using encapsulations 
   described in [RFC5087] has been left for further study.  
    
   Setup and maintenance of TDM PWs in MPLS networks using LDP is 
   described in []. 
    
    
2. L2TP Extension 
    
   The L2TP Control Connection is responsible for 3 main operations: 
   1. Establishment and validation of a pseudowire (PW) session. 
   2. Ending (tearing down) of a pseudowire session. 
   3.  Transferring of End Point status.

   Tearing down of session for a TDM pseudowire performed as described 
   in RFC3931]. 
    
   [RFC5086] and [RFC4553] describe how to transfer the Attachment 
   Circuit (AC) status via the data plane. Therefore the Set-Link-Info 
   (SLI) message described in [RFC3931] SHOULD NOT be used for conveying 
   this status for the PWs in question. 
    
   [RFC3931] specifies that the Circuit Status AVP MUST be present in 
   the ICRQ/ICRP messages. It also specifies that the N bit in this AVP 
   should be set during the PW setup even if the specific AC does not 
   provide any way to convey the "new AC" indication. Accordingly, the 
   Circuit Status AVP for the PWs in question, when used in the 
   ICRQ/ICRP messages, MUST always have both N and A bits set.  
    
   The next sections describe the extensions to L2TP for establishment 
   and validation of TDM pseudowire sessions. 
    
   There are two new AVPs for the Session Management messages. One AVP 
   describes the TDM pseudowire attributes. The second AVP describes the 
   RTP attributes for this TDM pseudowire.

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this 
   AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 
   12. 
    
   The Bit Rate field contains the value that represents the bit rate of 
   the local AC in the units of 64 Kbit/s encoded as an unsigned 16-bit 
   integer. Its usage for all types of TDM PWs employs the following 
   semantics: 
  1) Only the following values MUST be specified for structure-
     agnostic emulation (see [RFC4553]): 
     a) Structure-agnostic E1 emulation  - 32 
     b) Structure-agnostic T1 emulation: 
         i) MUST be set to 24 for the basic mode

         ii) MUST be set to 25 for the "Octet-aligned T1" 
            mode 
     c) Structure-agnostic E3 emulation  - 535 
     d) Structure-agnostic T3 emulation  - 699 
  2) For CESoPSN PWs this parameter MUST be set to the number of 
     DS0 channels in the corresponding attachment circuit. 
    
   Note: For structure-agnostic T1 emulation, the values 24 and 25 do 
   not reflect the exact bit rate, and are used for convenience only.  
    
   Note: The semantics of the Bit Rate field defined above are 
   consistent with those of the Bit Rate Interface Attribute as defined 
   in [RFC5287]. 
    
   The Payload Bytes field contains the value representing the number of 
   the TDM Payload bytes in the PW packet and is used with the following 
   semantics: 
    
  1) For structure-agnostic emulation any value of the payload 
     bytes can be specified. 
  2) For CESoPSN PWs: 
     a) The specified value MUST be an integer multiple of the 
         number of DS0 channels in the corresponding attachment 
         circuit. 
     b) In addition to that, for trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS, 
         the number of the trunk frames per multiframe fragment 
         (value resulting from the Payload Bytes divided by the 
         number of DS0 channels) MUST be an integer divisor of 
         the number of frames per corresponding trunk 
         multiframe. 
 
   The Reserved bits MUST be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be 
   ignored on reception. 
    
   The SP bits define support for the CESoPSN application signaling 
   packets (see [RFC5086]) and MUST be used as following: 
  1) Set to '01' for the CESoPSN PWs carrying TDM data packets and 
     expecting CE application signaling packets in a separate PW 
  2) Set to '10' for a PW carrying CE application signaling packets 
     with the data packets in a separate PW 
  3) Set to '11' for e CESoPSN PW carrying both TDM data and 
     signaling packets 
  4) Set to '00' for SAToP PWs and for CESoPSN PWs not using 
     separate signaling packets.  
   
   The CAS bits define the trunk type for trunk-specific CESoPSN 
   services with CAS. These bits: 
  1) For trunk-specific CESoPSN with CAS these bits MUST be set to: 
     a) '01' in the case of an E1 trunk

     b) '10' in the case of a T1/ESF trunk 
     c) '11' in the case of a T1/SF trunk. 
  2) MUST be set to '00' for all the other TDM pseudowire types.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Presence of this AVP indicates that the RTP header is used in the TDM 
   pseudowire encapsulation. Use or non-use of the RTP header MUST match 
   for the two directions of a TDM PW. This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit 
   MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The 
   Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 16. 
    
   The D bit indicates the timestamping mode (absolute or differential) 
   in the RTP header. These modes are described in, e.g., in [RFC4553], 
   Section 4.3.2. If the D bit is set to 1 then the Differential 
   timestamping mode is used, otherwise the Absolute timestamping mode 
   is used.  Timestamping modes can be used independently for the two 
   directions of a TDM PW. 
    
   The C bit indicates the ordering of the RTP header and the control 
   word as following: 
    
    o If the C bit is set to 1 the RTP header appears after the 
     control word in the data channel of the TDM pseudowire. This 
     mode is described as SAToP/CESoPSN encapsulation over 
     IPv4/IPv6 PSN with L2TPv3 demultiplexing in [RFC4553] and 
     [RFC5086] respectively.  
    o If the C bit is set to 0 the RTP header appears before the 
     control word.  This mode described as the old mode of the 
     SAToP/CESoPSN encapsulation over L2TPv3 in [RFC4553], Appendix 
     A, and [RFC5086], Annex C, respectively.   
    
   PT is the payload type expected in the RTP header.  A value of zero 
   indicates that the receiver shall not check payload type to detect 
   malformed packets.

   Timestamp Clock Frequency is the clock frequency used for the time 
   stamping in units of 8 KHz. 
    
   SSRC indicates the expected value of SSRC ID in the RTP header.  A 
   zero in this field means that SSRC ID will not be used for detecting 
   misconnections. Since L2TP provides an alternative security mechanism 
   using cookies, if the cookie length is larger than zero the SSRC 
   SHOULD be zero. 
    
2.3 Changes in the Control Connection AVPs 
    
   Control Connections that support TDM PWs MUST add the appropriate PW 
   Type value(s) to the list in the Pseudowire Capabilities List AVP. 
   The valid values are listed in the next section. 
    
2.4 Changes in the Session Connection AVPs 
    
   PW Type AVP should be set to one of the following values: 
   1. Structure-agnostic emulation [RFC4553] of: 
      a. E1 circuits - TBA-SAToP-E1 by IANA  
      b. T1 circuits - TBA-SAToP-T1 by IANA  
      c. E3 circuits - TBA-SAToP-E3 by IANA  
      d. T3 circuits - TBA-SAToP-T3 by IANA  
   2. Structure-aware emulation [RFC5086] of: 
      a. CESoPSN basic mode - TBA-CESoPSN-Basic by IANA  
      b. Trunk-specific CESoPSN service with CAS - TBA-CESoPSN-
         CAS by IANA 
    
   TDM pseudowires use their own control word.  Therefore the L2-
   Specific Sublayer AVP MUST either be omitted or set to zero. 
    
   TDM pseudowires use their own sequencing.  Therefore the Data 
   Sequencing AVP MUST either be omitted or set to zero. 
    
   Note: The Control Word (CW) used in the SAToP and CESoPSN 
   encapsulations over L2TPv3 effectively represents a dedicated L2-
   Specific Sub-layer.  
    
3. Creation of the TDM Pseudowire Session 
    
   When LCCE wants to open a Session for TDM PW it MUST include the TDM 
   PW AVP (in any case) and the RTP AVP (if and only if the RTP header 
   is used) in the ICRQ or OCRQ message.  The LCCE peer must validate 
   the TDM PW AVP and make sure it can meet the requirements derived 
   from the RTP AVP (if it exists).  If the peer agrees with the TDM AVP 
   it will send an appropriate ICRP or OCRP message with the matching 
   RTP AVP (if needed). The Initiator need to validate that it can 
   supply the requirements derived from the received RTP AVP.

   The two peers MUST agree on the values in the TDM PW AVP: 
    
   1. Bit Rate values MUST be equal on both sides. If they are 
      different, the connection will be rejected with return code 
      RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-1.  
   2. In the case of trunk-specific CESoPSN with CAS, the trunk 
      type (as encoded in the CAS bits of the TDM AVP) MUST be the 
      same for the two sides. Otherwise the connection will be 
      rejected with return code RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-2. 
   3. If one side does not support the payload bytes value proposed 
      by the other one, the connection will be rejected with return 
      code RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-3. 
   4. If one side cannot send RTP header as requested by the other 
      side, the connection will be rejected with return code RC-
      TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-4. 
   5. If one side can send RTP header but not with the requested 
      timestamp clock frequency, the connection will be rejected 
      with return code RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-5. 
 
  If CE signaling for a CESoPSN basic PW is transported in a separate PW 
  instance, then the two PW instances: 
   
   1. MUST use the same PW type 
   2. MUST use the same values in all the fields of the TDM AVP 
      excluding the SP field which must be set to '01' for the TDM 
      data PW and to '10' for the PW carrying CE application 
      signaling 
   3. MUST both use or not use RTP header (and accordingly, 
      include or not include the RTP AVP). 
   
    
4. IANA Considerations 
 
   This draft requires assignment of the following values by IANA: 
    
   New L2TPv3 Pseudowire Types: 
    
       L2TPv3 Pseudowire Types: 
    
       0x0011 (TBA-SAToP-E1)      - Structure-agnostic E1 circuit 
       0x0012 (TBA-SAToP-T1)      - Structure-agnostic T1 (DS1) circuit 
       0x0013 (TBA-SAToP-E3)      - Structure-agnostic E3 circuit 
       0x0014 (TBA-SAToP-T3)      - Structure-agnostic T3 (DS3) circuit 
       0x0015 (TBA-CESoPSN-Basic) - CESoPSN basic mode 
       0x0017 (TBA-CESoPSN-CAS)   - CESoPSN TDM with CAS

   Note that the values listed are suggested, to match with the values     
   defined in [RFC4446] for the MPLS Pseudowire Types. 
    
   New attribute value pair IDs: 
    
   1. AVP-TBD-1 - TDM Pseudowire AVP 
   2. AVP-TBD-2 - RTP AVP 
    
   New return codes for the CDN message: 
    
   1. RC-TBD-1 - return code to indicate connection refused 
      because of TDM PW parameters. The error code indicates the 
      problem. 
  
 New error codes, to be used with the RC-TDB-1 return code: 
  
   1. EC-TBD-1 - Bit Rate values disagree. 
   2. EC-TBD-2 - Different trunk types in the case of trunk-
      specific CESoPSN with CAS 
   3. EC-TBD-3 - Requested payload size too big or too small. 
   4. EC-TBD-4 - RTP header cannot be generated. 
   5. EC-TBD-5 - Requested timestamp clock frequency cannot be 
      generated 
  
   Any values that are reserved or unassigned in this specification are 
   assignable by Expert Review [RFC5226]. 
    
5. Congestion Control 
    
   The congestion considerations from [RFC4553] and [RFC5086] apply    
   respectively to the structure-agnostic and CESoPSN modes of this    
   specification. 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document specifies only the L2TPv3-based control plane for setup 
   of TDM PWs. Within this scope, there are no additional security 
   considerations on top of those discussed in [RFC3931]. 
    
   Common data plane security considerations for the TDM PWs have been 
   discussed in some detail in both [RFC4553] and [RFC5086]. On top of 
   these, the L2TPv3-based data plane provides additional security 
   mechanisms based on usage of cookies.
