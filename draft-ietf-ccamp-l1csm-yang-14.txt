Abstract

   This document provides a YANG data model for Layer 1 Connectivity
   Service Model (L1CSM).  The intent of this document is to provide a
   Layer 1 service model exploiting YANG data model, which can be
   utilized by a customer network controller to initiate a service
   request connectivity as well as retrieving service states toward a
   Layer 1 network controller communicating with its customer network
   controller.  This YANG model is NMDA-compliant.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides a YANG data model for L1VPN Connectivity
   Service Model (L1CSM) which can be classified as Network Service YANG
   module per [RFC8199].  The intent of this document is to provide a
   transport service model exploiting YANG data model, which can be
   utilized by a client network controller to initiate a service request
   connectivity request as well as retrieving service states toward a
   transport network controller communicating with the client controller
   via a NETCONF [RFC8341] or a RESTCONF [RFC8040] interface.

   [RFC4847] provides a framework and service level requirements for
   Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs).  It classifies service
   models as management-based service model, signaling-based service
   model (Basic Mode) and signaling and routing service model (Enhanced
   Mode).

   In the management-based service model, customer management systems
   and provider management systems communicate with each other.
   Customer management systems access provider management systems to
   request layer 1 connection setup/deletion between a pair of CEs.
   Customer management systems may obtain additional information, such
   as resource availability information and monitoring information, from
   provider management systems.  There is no control message exchange
   between a CE and PE.

   In the signaling-based service model (Basic Model), the CE-PE
   interface's functional repertoire is limited to path setup signaling
   only.  In the Signaling and routing service model (Enhanced Mode),
   the CE-PE interface provides the signaling capabilities as in the
   Basic Mode, plus permits limited exchange of information between the
   control planes of the provider and the customer to help such
   functions as discovery of customer network routing information (i.e.,
   reachability or TE information in remote customer sites), or
   parameters of the part of the provider's network dedicated to the
   customer.

   The primary focus of this document is to describe L1CS YANG model
   required for the instantiation of point-to-point L1VPN service.  A
   L1VPN is a service offered by a core layer 1 network to provide layer
   1 connectivity between two or more customer sites where the customer
   has some control over the establishment and type of the connectivity.

   The data model presented in Section 3 is in consistent with [MEF63].
   The data model includes configuration and state data according to the
   new Network Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

1.1.  Deployment Scenarios

   Figure 1 depicts a deployment scenario of the L1VPN SDN control-based
   service model for an external customer instantiating L1 point-to-
   point connectivity to the provider.

   With this scenario, the customer service orchestrator interfaces with
   the network SDN controller of the provider using Customer Service
   Model as defined in [RFC8309].

   Figure 2 depicts another deployment scenario for internal customer
   (e.g., higher-layer service management department(s)) interfacing the
   layer 1 transport network department.  With this scenario, a multi-
   service backbone is characterized such that each service department
   of a provider (e.g., L2/3 services) that receives the same provider's
   L1VPN service provides a different kind of higher-layer service.  The
   customer receiving the L1VPN service (i.e., each service department)
   can offer its own services, whose payloads can be any layer (e.g.,
   ATM, IP, TDM).  The layer 1 transport network and each service

   network belong to the same organization, but may be managed
   separately.  The Service SDN Controller is the control/management
   entity owned by higher-layer service department (e.g., L2/3 VPN)
   whereas the Network SDN Controller is the control/management entity
   responsible for Layer 1 connectivity service.  The CEs in Figure 2
   are L2/3 devices that interface with L1 PE devices.

   The benefit is that the same layer 1 transport network resources are
   shared by multiple services.  A large capacity backbone network (data
   plane) can be built economically by having the resources shared by
   multiple services usually with flexibility to modify topologies,
   while separating the control functions for each service department.
   Thus, each customer can select a specific set of features that are
   needed to provide their own service [RFC4847].

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true") These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.

   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   unis:

   - id

   Service:

   - service-id

   - endpoint-1

   - endpoint-2

   - start-time

   - time-interval

   - performance-metric

Internet-Draft     A YANG Data Model for Layer 1 Types     February 2021


   The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
   [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.

6.  IANA Considerations

   It is proposed that IANA should assign new URIs from the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688] as follows:


         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l1csm
         Registrant Contact: The IESG
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document registers following YANG modules in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950].


      name:         ietf-l1csm
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l1csm
      prefix:       l1csm
      reference:    RFC XXXX


7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Tom Petch for his helpful comments
   and valuable contributions and Robert Wilton for his review that
   improved the model significantly.

Appendix A.  JSON Example

   This section provides a JSON example of the YANG module described in
   Section 4.  This example configures one L1VC service with two UNIs
   that describe the UNI endpoints.  The service is configured with the
   starting time to be 06:06:09 on 2018-09-13 for the service life time
   of 2419200 seconds (which is corresponds to 28 days).  In addition,
   the service is configured to collect one performance metric, One-way-
   Delay.
