               Advertising Service Functions Using IS-IS
                 draft-xu-isis-service-function-adv-03

Abstract

   Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) WG specifies a special
   MPLS-based source routing mechanism, called MPLS-SPRING.  Such source
   routing mechanism can be leveraged to realize the service path layer
   functionality of service function chaining (i.e, steering traffic
   through a particular service function path) by encoding the service
   function path information as an explicit path information in the form
   of an MPLS label stack.  This document describes how to advertise
   service functions and their corresponding attributes (e.g.,segment
   ID) using IS-IS.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.xu-sfc-using-mpls-spring] describes how to leverage MPLS-SPRING
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls]) (a.k.a., an MPLS-based source
   routing mechanism) to realize the service path layer functionality of
   the Service Function Chaining (SFC), i.e, steering traffic through
   the Service Function Path (SFP).  To allow a service classifier to
   attach the segment list (i.e., an MPLS label stack) which represents
   a particular SFP to the selected traffic, the service classifier
   needs to know on which Service Function Forwarder (SFF) a given
   Service Function (SF) is located and what segment ID (SID) is used to
   indicate that SF.  This document describes how to advertise Service
   Functions (SFs) and their corresponding attributes (e.g.,SID) using
   IS-IS.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4971],
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture] and [I-D.xu-sfc-using-mpls-spring].

3.  Advertising Service Functions and Corresponding SIDs

   SFFs within the SFC domain need to advertise each SF they are
   offering by using a new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
   [RFC4971].  This new sub-TLV is called as Service Function sub-TLV.
   The Service Function sub-TLV could appear multiple times wihin a
   given IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV when more than one SF needs to be
   advertised.  The scope of the advertisement depends on the
   application but it is recommended that it SHOULD be domain-wide.
   Furthermore, SFFs need to allocate a corresponding SID to each SF
   they are offering and advertise it by using a sub-TLV of the above
   Service Function sub-TLV, called SF SID sub-TLV.  To support the
   approach of encoding SFP information in the form of an MPLS label
   stack as described in [I-D.xu-sfc-using-mpls-spring], SFFs SHOULD
   allocate a locally significant MPLS label to each SF they are
   offering.

      Service Function Identifier: A unique identifier that represents
      an SF within an SFC-enabled domain.

      Sub-TLVs: contains zero or more sub-TLVs corresponding to the
      particular attributes of a given SF.  The SF SID sub-TLV as
      defined in Section 3.2 is one such sub-TLV which is used to
      indicate the corrresponding SF SID.  Other sub-TLVs are to be
      defined in the future.
