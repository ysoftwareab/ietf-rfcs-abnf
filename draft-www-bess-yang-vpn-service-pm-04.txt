    A YANG Model for Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring
                 draft-www-bess-yang-vpn-service-pm-04

Abstract

   The data model defined in [RFC8345] introduces vertical layering
   relationships between networks that can be augmented to cover
   network/service topologies.  This document defines a YANG model for
   both Network Performance Monitoring and VPN Service Performance
   Monitoring that can be used to monitor and manage network performance
   on the topology at higher layer or the service topology between VPN
   sites.  This model is an augmentation to the network topology YANG
   data model defined in [RFC8345].

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8345] defines an abstract YANG data model for network/service
   topologies and inventories.  Service topology described in [RFC8345]
   includes the a virtual topology for a service layer above the L1, L2,
   and L3 layers.  This service topology has the generic topology
   elements of node, link, and terminating point.  One typical example
   of a service topology is described in figure 3 of [RFC8345], two VPN
   service topologies instantiated over a common L3 topology.  Each VPN

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG        October 2019


   service topology is mapped onto a subset of nodes from the common L3
   topology.

   In [RFC8299], 3 types of VPN service topologies are defined for the
   L3VPN service data model: any to any; hub and spoke; and hub and
   spoke disjoint.  These VPN topology types can be used to describe how
   VPN sites communicate with each other.

   This document defines a YANG Model for both Network performance
   monitoring and VPN Service Performance Monitoring that can be used to
   monitor and manage network Performance on the topology at higher
   layer or the service topology between VPN sites and it is an
   augmentation to the network topology YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8345].

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  In this
   document, these words will appear with that interpretation only when

   interpreted as carrying [RFC2119] significance.

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Network and VPN service assurance module

   This module defined in this document is a Network and VPN Service
   assurance module that can be used to monitor and manage the network
   Performance on the topology at higher layer layer or the service
   topology between VPN sites and it is an augmentation to the "ietf-
   network" and "ietf-network-topology" YANG data model [RFC8345].  The
   performance monitoring data is augmented to service topology.

4.  Layering relationship between multiple layers of topology

   The data model defined in [RFC8345] can describe vertical layering
   relationships between networks.  That model can be augmented to cover
   network/service topologies.

   Figure 1 describes an example on topology mapping between the VPN
   service topology and the underlying network:

                VPN-SVC 1           VPN-SVC 2
                   /                     \
      VPN-Service-topology 1     VPN-Service-topology-2

    Bottom-up  |  |         \ /           /       |
    Network    |  |         /\           /        |
    topology   |  |       /    \        |         |

           node1 node2 node3   node4   node5    node6

    Example of topology mapping between VPN Service Topo and Underlying
                                  network

   As shown in Figure 1, Site-1A, Site-1B, and Site-1C are mapped to
   nodes 1, 2, and 3, while Site-2A, Site-2B, and Site-2C are mapped to
   nodes 4, 5, and 6 in the underlying physical network.  In this
   figure, two VPN services topologies are both built on top of one
   common underlying physical network.

      VPN-SVC 1: supporting hub-spoke communication for Customer 1
      connecting the customers access at 3 sites

      VPN-SVC 2: supporting hub-spoke disjoint communication for
      Customer 2 connecting the customers access at 3 sites

   VPN service topology 1 is hub and spoke topology while VPN service
   topology 2 is hub and spoke disjoint topology.  In VPN service
   topology 1, Site-1 A plays the role of hub while Site-2 B and C plays
   the role of spoke.  In VPN service topoogy 2, Site-2 A and B play the
   role of hub while Site-2 C plays the role of spoke.

5.  Model Usage Guideline

   An SP must be able to manage the capabilities and characteristics of
   their Network/VPN services when Network connection is established or
   VPN sites are setup to communicate with each other.  VPN service
   topology such as hub and spoke describes how these VPN sites are
   communicating with each other.

5.1.  Performance Monitoring Data Source

   As described in Section 4, once the mapping between VPN Service
   topology and underlying physical network has been setup, the
   performance monitoring data per link in the underlying network can be
   collected using network performance measurement method such as MPLS
   Loss and Delay Measurement [RFC6374].  The performance monitoring
   information reflecting the quality of the Network or VPN service such
   as end to end network performance data between source node and
   destination node in the network or between VPN sites can be
   aggregated or calculated using PCEP solution [RFC5440] or LMAP
   solution [RFC8194].  The information can be fed into data source such
   as the management system or network devices.  The measurement
   interval and report interval associated with these performance data
   usually depends on configuration parameters.

5.2.  Retrieval via I2RS Pub/Sub [RFC7923]

   Some applications such as service-assurance applications, which must
   maintain a continuous view of operational data and state, can use
   subscription model [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] to subscribe to the
   Network performance data or VPN service performance data they are
   interested in, at the data source.

   The data source can then use the Network and VPN service assurance
   model defined in this document and push model [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-
   push] to distribute specific telemetry data to target recipients.

5.3.  On demand Retrieval via RPC model

   To obtain a snapshot of a large amount of performance data from the
   network element, service-assurance applications can also use polling
   based solution such as RPC model to fetch performance data on demand.

6.  Design of the Data Model

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-network-vpn-pm", which
   has the following structure

        augment /nw:networks/nw:network:
          +--rw vpn-topo-attributes
             +--rw vpn-topo?   identityref

                   Network Level View of the hierarchies

   For VPN service performance monitoring, this model defines only the
   following minimal set of Network level network topology attributes:

   o  Network-technology-type: Indicate the network technology type such
      as L3VPN, L2VPN,ISIS, OSPF.  If the network-technology-type is VPN
      type,e.g.,L3VPN, L2VPN, the VPN-topo should be set.

   o  vpn-topo: The type of VPN service topology, this model supports
      any-to-any, Hub and Spoke (where Hubs can exchange traffic), and
      "Hub and Spoke disjoint" (where Hubs cannot exchange traffic).

   For network performance monitoring, the attributes of "Network Level"
   that defined in [RFC8345] do not need to be extended.

   The Network and VPN service performance monitoring model defines only
   the following minimal set of Node level network topology attributes
   and constraints:

   o  Node-type (Attribute): Indicate the type of the node, such as PE
      or ASBR.

   o  Site-id (Constraint): Uniquely identifies the site within the
      overall network infrastructure.

7.  Example of I2RS Pub/Sub Retrieval [RFC7923]

   This example shows the way for a client to subscribe for the
   Performance monitoring information between node A and node B in the
   L3 network topology built on top of the underlying network . The
   performance monitoring parameter that the client is interested in is
   end to end loss attribute.

8.  Example of RPC model based Retrieval

   This example shows the way for the client to use RPC model to fetch
   performance data on demand,e.g., the client requests packet-loss-
   count between PE1 in site 1 and PE2 in site 2 belonging to the same
   VPN1.

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] or NETCONF protocol ([RFC6241]).  The
   lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the transport-layer
   protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, see
   Section 2 in [RFC8040] and [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH)[RFC6242] . The lowest RESTCONF layer

   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/svc-topo:svc-telemetry-attributes

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/svc-topo:node-attributes
