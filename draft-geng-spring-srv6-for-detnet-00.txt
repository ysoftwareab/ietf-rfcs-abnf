1.  Introduction

   With more and more applications running in the Internet, quality of
   the service gains more and more attention, especially for some new
   applications, for example Cloud VR, Cloud Game, HDV (high-definition
   video) and so on, SLA (Service Level Agreement), including jitter,
   delay and loss rate, influences the users' experience significantly.
   So SLA guarantee is an important issue which requires new
   technologies and solutions for the network.

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture]) provides a capability to carry
   specified data flows for real-time applications with extremely low
   data loss rates, low jitter and bounded latency within a network
   domain.  Techniques used include: 1) providing explicit paths for
   DetNet flows that satisfies the SLA requirement from user and do not
   immediately change with the network topology; 2) reserving data plane
   resources for DetNet flows along the allocated path of the flow; 3)
   replicates DetNet flows into two or more copies and transport
   different copies through different path in parallel, called service
   protection.

Internet-Draft               SRv6 for DetNet                   July 2019


   Segment Routing(SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions,
   called "segments".  SR can be applied over IPv6 data plane using
   Routing Extension Header(SRH,
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]).  A segment in Segment
   Routing is not limited to a routing/forwarding function.  An SRv6
   Segment can indicate functions that are executed locally in the node
   where they are defined.
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming] describes some well-
   known functions and segments associated to them.  SRH
   TLVs([I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]) also provides meta-data
   for segment processing.  All these features make SRv6 suitable to
   carry DetNet flows, by defining new segments associated with DetNet
   functions and meta data for DetNet.

   This document describes the concepts needed by implementing DetNet in
   an SRv6-based domain and provides considerations for any
   corresponding implementation.

   Editor's note:

   1.  DetNet is limited in a controlled network domain, and it is not
   the only method to provide SLA guarantee.  But it is a good start to
   discuss how to use SRv6 to have a SLA-guaranteed network service.

   2.  Resource Reservation will be added in future work.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terminologies for DetNet go along with the definition in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]:

   DetNet domain

      The portion of a network that is DetNet aware.  It includes end
      systems and DetNet nodes

   DetNet edge node

      An instance of a DetNet relay node that acts as a source and/ or
      destination at the DetNet service sub-layer.  For example, it can
      include a DetNet service sub-layer proxy function for DetNet
      service protection (e.g., the addition or removal of packet

      sequencing information) for one or more end systems, or starts or
      terminates resource allocation at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer,
      or aggregates DetNet services into new DetNet flows.  It is
      analogous to a Label Edge Router (LER) or a Provider Edge (PE)
      router.

   DetNet relay node

      A DetNet node including a service sub-layer function that
      interconnects different DetNet forwarding sub-layer paths to
      provide service protection.  A DetNet relay node participates in
      the DetNet service sub-layer.  It typically incorporates DetNet
      forwarding sub-layer functions as well, in which case it is
      collocated with a transit node.

   DetNet transit node

      A DetNet node operating at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer, that
      utilizes link layer and/or network layer switching across multiple
      links and/or sub-networks to provide paths for DetNet service sub-
      layer functions.  Typically provides resource allocation over
      those paths.  An MPLS LSR is an example of a DetNet transit node.

   End system

      End systems of interest to this document are either sources or
      destinations of DetNet flows.  And end system may or may not be
      DetNet forwarding sub-layer aware or DetNet service sub-layer
      aware.

   DetNet service sub-layer

      DetNet functionality is divided into two sub-layers.  One of them
      is the DetNet service sub-layer, at which a DetNet service, e.g.,
      service protection is provided.

   DetNet forwarding sub-layer

      DetNet functionality is divided into two sub-layers.  One of them
      is the DetNet forwarding sub-layer, which optionally provides
      resource allocation for DetNet flows over paths provided by the
      underlying network.

3.  SRv6 for DetNet Overview

   As mentioned above, there are mainly three technologies/functions
   defined in DetNet: Explicit Route, Resource Reservation and Service
   Protection.  Explicit Route is the basic of the other two



Geng, et al.             Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               SRv6 for DetNet                   July 2019


   technologies, and guarantees the path satisfies the SLA requirement
   from application.  Resource Reservation protects DetNet flows from
   network congestion, which could reduce the end-to-end latency and
   congestion loss; Service Protection prevents DetNet flow from random
   media errors and equipment failures, which makes the loss rate
   extremely low.

   In [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], DetNet functionality is
   implemented in two sub-layers in the protocol stack: the DetNet
   service sub-layer and the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.  The DetNet
   service sub-layer provides DetNet service, e.g., service protection.
   The DetNet forwarding sub-layer supports DetNet service in the
   underlying network, by providing explicit routes and resource
   allocation to DetNet flows.  There is no obvious protocol stack as
   MPLS, in SRv6 both service sub-layer and forwarding sub-layer are
   implemented through SRH.

   The following picture shows that a general DetNet enabled network
   defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] :

   TSN               Edge        Transit         Relay        DetNet
   End System        Node         Node           Node        End System

           +........+    +-[  Sub  ]-+  +.......+    +-[  Sub  ]-+
                           [Network]                   [Network]
                            `-----'                     `-----'

   In SRv6 for DetNet, the outer IPv6 Header with the SRH is used for
   carrying DetNet flows.  Explicit path is instantiated in the segment
   list of SRH, and other functions/arguments for service protection
   (packet replication, elimination and ordering, PREOF) and resource
   reservation (packet queuing and scheduling) are also defined in the
   specified SID.  Meta data for DetNet could be instantiated in the
   Optional TLVs.

4.1.  Service Protection Scenarios

   The figure below shows that an IPv6 flow is sent out from the end
   station E1.  The packet of the flow is encapsulated in an outer
   IPv6+SRH header as a DetNet SRv6 packet in the Ingress(In) and
   transported through an SRv6 DetNet domain.  In the Egress(Eg), the
   outer IPv6 header+SRH of the packet is popped, and the packet is sent
   to the destination E2.

                |                                         |
    ----IPv6--->|<---------------SRv6 DetNet------------->|<----IPv6---
                |                                         |
                |             +------+T2+----+            |
      +---+    +---+        +-+-+          +-+-+        +---+    +---+
      | E1+----| In|--+T1+--+R1 |          |R2 |--+T4+--| Eg+----+ E2|
      +---+    +---+        +-+-+          +-+-+        +---+    +---+
                              +-----+T3+-----+

   The DetNet packet processing is as follows:

   Ingress:

      Inserts the SRv6 Policy that will steer the packet from Ingress to
      the destination

      The methods and mechanisms used for defining, instantiating and
      applying the policy are outside of this document.  An example of
      policies are described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]

      Flow Identification and Sequence Number are carried in the SRH.

   Relay Node 1(Replication Node):

      Replicates the payload and IPv6 Header with the SRH.  This is a
      new function in the context of SRv6 Network Programming which will
      associate a given SID to a replication instruction in the node
      originating and advertising the SID.  The replication instruction
      includes:



      *  The removal of the existing IPv6+SRH header

      *  The encapsulation into a new outer IPv6+SRH header.  Each
         packet (the original and the duplicated) are encapsulated into
         respectively new outer IPv6+SRH headers.

      Binding two different SRv6 Policies respectively to the original
      packet and the replicated packet, which can steer the packets from
      Relay Node 1 to Relay Node 2 through two tunnels.

   Relay Node 2(Elimination Node):

      Eliminates the redundant packets.

      Binds a new SRv6 Policy to the survival packet, which steers the
      packet from Relay Node 2 to Egress.

   Egress:

      Decapsulates the outer Ipv6 header.

      Sends the inter packet to the End Station 2.

   The DetNet packet encapsulation is illustrated here below.  It has to
   be noted that, in the example below, the R2 address is a SRH SID
   associated to a TBD function related to the packet replication the
   node R1 has to perform.  The same (or reverse) apply to node R2 which
   is in charge of the discard of the duplicated packet.  Here also a
   new function will have a new SID allocated to it and representing the
   delete of the duplication in R2.

      End Station1 output packet: (E1,E2)

      Ingress output packet: (In, T1)(R1,T1, SL=2)(E1,E2)

      Transit Node1 output packet: (In, R1)(R1,T1,SL=1)(E1,E2)

      Relay Node1 output packets : (R1,T2)(R2,T2,SL=2)(E1,E2),
      (R1,T3)(R2,T3,SL=2)(E1,E2)

      Transit Node2 output packet: (R1, R2)(R2,T2,SL=1)(E1,E2)

      Transit Node3 output packet: (R1, R2)(R2,T3,SL=1)(E1,E2)

      Relay Node2 output packet: (R2, T4)(Eg,T4,SL=2)(E1,E2)

      Transit Node4 output packet: (R2, Eg)(Eg,T4,SL=1)(E1,E2)

      Egress out : (E1,E2)

4.2.  Data Plane Considerations

   Flow Identification and sequence number are necessary in the
   encapsulation of SRv6 for DetNet in order to support service
   protection.  Replication nodes decide which DetNet flows are supposed
   to be replicated by identifying the flow with the flow
   identification.  Elimination nodes decide whether a packet should be
   dropped because of redundancy by identifying the flow identification
   and sequence number.

            +---------------------------------------+
                        DetNet Domain

   1.  Edge node->Controller: Sends a path computation requirement
   containing that service protection in order to have ultra-reliability
   through PCEP/BGP extenisons.

   2.  Controller->Edge node: Computes a P2MP2P path, including
   replication nodes and elimination nodes.  Between a pair of
   replication node and elimination node, there are more than one path,
   and if any equipment failure happens in one of them, the DetNet
   service is not interrupted.  Send the path computation result to the
   edge node through PCEP/BGP extensions.

   3.  Controller->Relay Node : In a P2MP2P path, every pair of
   replication node and elimination node should be configured to
   identify different DetNet flows by the different flow
   identifications, and the rule of sequence number should be negotiated
   between relay nodes.  After replication or elimination, the explicit
   path to the next relay is also required through BGP extensions or
   Netconf YANG.

4.4.  Functions for Service Protection

   New SRv6 Network Programming functions are defined as follows:

4.4.1.  End. B.  Replication: Packet Replication Function

   1.   IF NH=SRH & SL>0 THEN

   2.   extract the DetNet TLV values from the SRH

   3.   create two new outer IPv6+SRH headers: IPv6-SRH-1 and IPv6-SRH-2
        Insert the policy-instructed segment lists in each newly created
        SRH (SRH-1 and SRH-2).  Also, add the extracted DetNet TLVs into
        SRH-1 and SRH-2.

   4.   remove the incoming outer IPv6+SRH header.

   5.   create a duplication of the incoming packet.

   6.   encapsulate the original packet into the first outer IPv6+SRH
        header: (IPv6-SRH-1) (original packet)

   7.   encapsulate the duplicate packet into the second outer IPv6+SRH
        header: (IPv6-SRH-2) (duplicate packet)

   8.   set the IPv6 SA as the local address of this node.

   9.   set the IPv6 DA of IPv6-SRH-1 to the first segment of the SRv6
        Policy in of SRH-1 segment list.

   10.  set the IPv6 DA of IPv6-SRH-2 to the first segment of the SRv6
        Policy in of SRH-2 segment list.

   11.  ELSE

   12.  drop the packet

4.4.2.  End. B.  Elimination: Packet Elimination Function

   1.  IF NH=SRH & SL>0 & "the packet is not a redundant packet" THEN

   2.  do not decrement SL nor update the IPv6 DA with SRH[SL]

   3.  extract the value of DetNet TLVs from the SRH

   4.  create a new outer IPv6+SRH header

Internet-Draft               SRv6 for DetNet                   July 2019


   5.  insert the policy-instructed segment lists in the newly created
       SRH and add the retrieved DetNet TLVs in the newly created SRH

   6.  remove the incoming outer IPv6+SRH header.

   7.  set the IPv6 DA to the first segment of the SRv6 Policy in the
       newly created SRH

   8.  ELSE

   9.  drop the packet

5.  Explicit Route

   SRv6 could support explicit route using segment list without extra
   extension.  In DetNet, explicit route could be used with service
   protection or resource reservation.  When explicit route works with
   service protection, a P2MP2P path is required to indicate the
   behavior of replication and elimination.  When explicit route works
   with resource reservation, the explicit path indicates the nodes or
   links a DetNet flow goes through, and also indicates the resource
   allocated for the DetNet flow in the specified nodes or links.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD
