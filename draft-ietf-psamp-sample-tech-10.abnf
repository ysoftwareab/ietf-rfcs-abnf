f1 = bits 32 to 63 of the IP header, comprising the IP     
          identification field, flags, and fragment offset. 
         
f2 = bits 96 to 127 of the IP header, the source IP address. 
         
f3 = bits 128 to 159 of the IP header, the destination IP  
          address. 
      
f4 = bits 32 to 63 of the IP payload. For a TCP packet, f4  
          comprises the TCP sequence number followed by the message 
          length. For a UDP packet f4 comprises the UDP checksum.
