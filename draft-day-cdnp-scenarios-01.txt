1. Introduction

   This document presents several logical scenarios which are intended
   to describe the potential configurations that can be realized when
   peering CDNs. These logical scenarios describe how various entities
   may combine to provide a complete CDN solution. These scenarios
   answer two distinct needs:

   1.  To provide some concrete examples of what CDN peering is, and

   2.  To provide a basis for evaluating CDN peering proposals.

   Each of the logical peering scenarios gives an indication of how the
   various CDN elements are combined. From [2] these elements are:

   1.  REDIRECTION SYSTEM

   2.  DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

   3.  ACCOUNTING SYSTEM

   The peering scenarios presented in this document are also framed by
   the following concepts:

   1.  Content Has Value

   2.  Distribution Has Value

   3.  Users Have Value

   At present, the references to the above concepts are only employed
   when they directly affect the nature of the peering scenario. A
   reader who is interested in a detailed description of these concepts
   is referred to [3].

   Terms in ALL CAPS are defined in [1].

2. Fundamental Concepts

   There are many potential peering configurations that can be imagined
   for peered CDNs. All of these configurations MUST adhere to the
   following concepts:

   There is only one FIRST-REDIRECTION system for a given set of
   CONTENT: 

      In order to prevent potential conflicts this document assumes
      that there is one and only one FIRST-REDIRECTION SYSTEM. All
      other REDIRECTION SYSTEMs MUST honor this relationship. 


   There may be more than one ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: 

      These scenarios assume that multiple ACCOUNTING ENTITIES may
      coexist. These entities may require specific ACCOUNTING
      information or they may share this information depending upon the
      function that they provide. 


   There may be more than one DISTRIBUTING CDN: 

      These scenarios assume that multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs may
      coexist. They further assume that these CDNs may have peering
      relationships that are outside the scope of the scenario being
      discussed.

3. Logical Peering Scenarios

   This section provides several logical peering scenarios that may
   arise in peered CDN implementations.

3.1 Expanding Existing CDN Footprint

   This scenario considers the case where two or more existing CDNs
   wish to peer in order to provide an increased scale and reach. It
   assumes that both of them already provide REDIRECTION, DISTRIBUTION,
   and ACCOUNTING services and that they will continue to provide these
   services to existing customers.

   In this scenario it is assumed that the peering relationship between
   all entities is comprised of; REDIRECTION PEERING, DISTRIBUTION
   PEERING, and ACCOUNTING PEERING.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered CDNs
   may also have other peering arrangements which may or may not be
   transitive to peering relationships created for the above purpose.

3.2 ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION PEERING Across Multiple DISTIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a single entity performs
   ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION functions but has no inherent
   DISTRIBUTION capabilities. This entity must therefore peer with one
   or more DISTRIBUTING CDNs in order to provide a complete solution.

   In this scenario the entity which operates the ACCOUNTING SYSTEM and
   REDIRECTION SYSTEM, at a minumum, would enter into REDIRECTION
   PEERING and ACCOUNTING PEERING relationships with each of the
   DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   The entity which operates the ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION SYSTEMs
   could also play an active role in managing the DISTRIBUTION. In this
   case an additional DISTRIBUTION PEERING relationships are required.

   It is worth noting that the REDIRECTION SYSTEM discussed here is
   typically the FIRST-REDIRECTION SYSTEM although that is not a
   requirement.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered
   entities may also have other peering arrangements which may or may
   not be transitive to peering relationships created for the above
   purpose.

3.3 ACCOUNTING PEERING Across Multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a single ACCOUNTING SYSTEM

Internet-Draft                   CDNPS                    September 2000


   which provides a settlement/clearing-house function wishes to peer
   w/mulitple DISTRIBUTING CDNs. For the purposes of this scenario it
   is not necessary to consider the specifics of REDIRECTION PEERING.

   In this scenario the entity which operates the ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
   would enter into ACCOUNTING PEERING relationships w/one or more
   DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

3.4 PUBLISHER peers w/multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a PUBLISHER wishes to
   directly enter into peering relationships w/multiple DISTRIBUTING
   CDNs. In this scenario it is assumed that the PUBLISHER operates as
   the FIRST-REDIRECTION SYSTEM for its CONTENT although it is possible
   that this function may be designated to one of the DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   In this scenario the PUBLISHER would enter into; DISTRIBUTION
   PEERING, ACCOUNTING PEERING, and REDIRECTION peering with one or
   more DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

4. Security Considerations

   This document describes scenarios for use in evaluating CDN peering
   proposals. As such, it does not propose any solutions which might
   have security concerns.

   This docment assumes that any peering solutions which are derived
   within the context of Content Alliance effort will be compliant with
   the trust model given in [4].

5. Conclusion

   The set of scenarios contained within this document illustrate the
   complete set of requirements which should be met in the design of
   CDN peering system(s).
