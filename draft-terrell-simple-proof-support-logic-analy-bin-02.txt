Abstract


    The simple proof outlined in this presentation, regarding the
    Logical Analysis of the Binary System, and the argument
    concerning the Logical Derivation of the New Method for
    Enumeration, which disputes the Modern Interpretation for
    the Binary System, as being illogical and incorrect. Is in
    fact, No proof at all. What I am presenting is a Comparative
    Analysis; "Modern Interpretation" vs. "My Results", which
    poses 2 questions: "Well, how do you begin your count? I
    mean, if there are 5 objects to be counted, would your count
    start with 'Zero' or 'One'?". 
    
    Furthermore, while the first version of this draft invoked a
    negative response. That is, an acknowledgment was reached,
    regarding the existence of another Binary System. However,
    no one concurred with the results claiming the expulsion of the
    Modern Interpretation. Nevertheless, this is an argument, and
    the results derived there from, reserved for the venue of the
    Appendix, which sets the tone to resolve such questions as:

      "Do we now have 2 Binary Systems, establishing a slightly
      different, and yet, equal relationship with the Set of
      Integers? I mean, what do we have here? Is it possible
      to have 2 distinct Binary Systems, whose difference
      represents a different 'One-to-One Pairing' with the
      Integers? Or are we to try once again, and decide, which
      one of the two Numbering Systems actually represents a True
      Binary System?"


   Nevertheless, in either case, it should be stated that the
   conclusions from this work produce an unquestionable outcome:

      "The System of counting presently being used is a UNARY System,
       from which the sequence of Counting begins with the Number '1',
       and continues its progression using successive additions of the
       Number '1' to derive the next or succeeding numbers. And while it
       maybe called or labeled as being something different (i.e.
       Decimal System), it is nevertheless Unary. Furthermore, while
       Zero, '0', is used in every Numbering System, it is not itself,
       a Number. It is only a symbolic notation, which represents
       emptiness, or lack of an Object to which it refers. Hence,
       Binary by definition, means '2', and nothing more. Therefore,
       when considering the construction of any Numbering System that
       employs or uses Binary Notation, we must first realize that the
       first '4' numbers are derived from the Total Number of Possible
       Unique Combinations, which are related to and derived from, the
       Sequenced Numbers or Elements depicted as being Members of the
       Binary Set. And further conclude, that all other succeeding
       Binary Numbers are derived from these Combinations. In which
       case, since the Binary Set equals {0,1}, the total number of
       Unique Combinations equals the set {00, 01, 10, 11}."

Introduction: Beginning the Analysis

    To begin this task, we must first choose a beginning, and I
    have chosen a Table, which represents a  'one-to-one'
    relationship or pairing that expresses the Modern
    interpretation of the relationship existing between the
    Integers and the Binary Numbers. Where by, Table I
    we have:

    Clearly, this can quite easily become a very long Table, and
    an extremely time consuming endeavor regarding its
    construction. But, if you are satisfied with its present
    construction, and can fill in the missing entries using some
    popular calculator, then I can proceed with the construction of
    the Table yielding My Results. Given by, TABLE II, we have:

    First, it should be clear from the basic rules of Set Theory,
    that 'Any 0ne-to-One Pairing' between the objects representing
    the Binary Set and those representing the Set of Integers, is
    valid for both Tables. However, continued observation of the
    Tables also reveals (using the comparison) a difference, which
    exist between the Binary Representation and the associated
    value represented by the Integers. In other words, the Binary
    Representation is Paired or Associated with a different Value for
    the Integer in each of the Tables. At this point, everyone would
    wonder, which of the 2 Tables, pairing the Binary
    Representation with one and only one Integer, is valid. And the
    answer is; they both are valid. However, problem that must be
    resolved, is a decision that bars arbitrary choice. That is, which
    one of these 2 Tables can it be concluded, actually represents
    an Equality existing between the Binary Representation and the
    Integers, established by this 'One-to-One Pairing'? 



Chapter I: Broadening the Analysis of the Comparison 


    We encountered a dilemma in the Introduction, because we
    observed the creation of 2 distinct Sets, which are both, at this
    point, equally valid representations for the Binary Method of
    Enumeration (Counting). However, because of this difference,
    we can only choose one of the methods depicted by the Tables,
    which can be used when establishing a relationship of Equality
    with the Integers. In other words, a One-to-One Pairing creating
    Equality, can exist between any 2 Sets. Where the only
    requirement is that, they each maintain the same Total Number
    of Members. Nevertheless, using appropriate  substitutions for
    simplification, we can view this dilemma graphically. That is,
    the Sets denoted by 'eq.1' and 'eq.2', can be mapped in a
    'one-to-one' correspondence with the Integers, which is denoted
    respectively by Figures 1 and 2.




                       Eq.1  {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
 
                       Eq.2  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}










E Terrell                                                      [Page 8]

Logical Analysis of the Binary System                 February 13, 2002









                        Fig 1.

       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  = The Count of Total Number
      -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+     of Members in the Set
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   = The Elements or Members
                                  Listed in the SET



                        Fig 2.

       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  = The Count of Total Number


      -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+     of Members in the Set
       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  = The Elements or Members
                                  Listed in the SET




    Now, comparing each of these Sets you will notice first, they
    are not Identical, and second, when observing figures 1 and 2,
    you will notice they are only Equal in the count representing
    the total number Members they contain. But, only one of these
    Sets can be paired in a 'One-to-One' correspondence with the
    Set of Integers would produce an Identity in their definitions,
    from which it can be concluded that an equality between the
    members of both Sets exist. In other words, when counting the
    Members of any Set, we can only associate the Members of
    the Set with Number representing its placement within the Set,
    or some Number representing the total Number of Members the
    Set contains. This is only a comparison yielding some data
    associated with Counting, which in this case, uses the Set of
    Integers as the comparative tool for analysis. However, this
    comparison does not produce nor establish an Identity by
    definition, between the members of the Binary Set and the
    members of the Set used in this comparison.

    Nevertheless, before we can continue this analysis, we must
    first agree to a Set of definitions, which will allow the necessary
    distinction that will show the differences between these Sets.
    Needless to say, without which, there can be No argument, nor
    Distinction between the Sets we have created. Hence, the
    evolution of 2 separate and distinct Methods of Enumeration for
    the Binary System that would be Equally valid.

Chapter II. Setting the Stage by Defining the Parameters 


    Can we all agree that Language is Ambiguous? And further
    note that, without the Rules governing some mandatory
    structure and definitions ascribing some meaning, Language
    the Tool that it is, would have no viable purpose. In other words,
    we could avoid the Trap that would ultimately befall us, if we
    would adhere to, and follow the following definitions. 


                         Definitions

 1. A 'SET': A Set is a Collection of Objects, which list the
     Members that can be arbitrarily chosen or included in the Set. 

 2. 'Binary Set': A Binary Set contains 2 Objects, which means
     have or consisting of 2 things.

 3. 'Integer': Any numerical representation, which is not a Fraction
     and does not contain a Fractional Component in its description
     or representation.

 4. 'One-to-One' Mapping or Correspondence: Any Pairing Such
     that, One and Only One Object is Compared with, or Mapped
     to One and Only One Object, in such a way that this Pairing
     Yields a Unique Object Consisting of Parts. 

 5. 'Zero': Any Object that has No Members, which has No Value,
     and does not consist of any Parts.

 6. 'Null Set': Any Set that is Empty, and contains No Members
     or Elements.

 7. 'Equality': A Relationship, which provide a means to establish
     an Identity between 2 or more Objects being compared. 

 8. 'Definition': A Grouping of Words, Objects, Numbers or some
     Combination derived there from, which ascribes some unique
     Meaning to the Object in which the Definition refers.

    If we can now all agree to the Definitions given above, and
    accept the meaning ascribe to the Objects they refer, then
    we can move on to Chapter III.   



Chapter III: Determining the Structure of Enumeration; 
                The Counting in the Binary System

    Please be patient with me, because throughout this
    comparison we will be reflecting back and forth between the
    Chapters that we have already read. However, this is
    necessary, because we cannot display, at least not on paper,
    all of the data that we have accumulated, which results from
    our agreements and the beginnings of our analysis.  

    Nevertheless, there are 2 things, which must immediately be
    brought to the forefront of our discussion. First, observe that
    figure 2 maintains a relationship, which by definition is Equality.
    And this Equality represents the Identity, which exist between
    the Members of the Set denoted by 'eq.2' and the Set of
    Integers, or Counting Numbers (Whole Numbers).  

    Second, you should note, that while there exist a 'One-to-One
    Correspondence' between the members of the Set denoted by
    'eq.1' and the Set of Integers, there is No Equality. And this is a
    valid observation when figure 1 is viewed, because by definition,
    'Zero' cannot be assigned any Value. But, the question to be
    imposed now is: 'How are these observations related to Tables
    1 and 2?'. While, further analysis would yield the question:
    'Could it be that, upon analysis, Table 1 would mimic 'eq.1', and
    Table 2 would mimic 'eq.2'?'. Nevertheless, even if the answer to
    the latter were true, it is not enough information upon which we
    could assert that the Modern Method of Enumeration for the
    Binary System is wrong! We must garner more facts to reach
    this conclusion, because from the information we have
    compiled thus far, clearly nothing is conclusive and neither
    method represented in Tables 1 and 2, can be either
    Right or Wrong.

    In other words, if we now pursue an analysis beyond the
    'One-to-One Correspondence' we have used thus far, and
    Equate, using the Results from Tables 1 and 2, the Members
    from the Binary Set with Members from the Set of Integers, as
    would be the results presented in Tables 1 and 2. Then what
    we would achieve, would be a situation existing between the
    Members of the Binary Set itself. That is, while the members
    from the Set of Integers can be shown to be equal to each other
    in a 'One-to-One Correspondence'. No such relationship can
    exist between the Members of the Binary Sets displayed by
    the 2 Tables in our analysis. This is because, the Members of
    the Binary Set in each of the Tables, independently from each
    other, has been assigned a Corresponding Value, creating a
    unique mapping with the members from the Set of  Integers,
    which establishes a conflict between the values of the Members
    from the Binary Sets in the respective Tables. This conflict
    exist because, there is a difference between the assigned
    value for the Integers associated with the members from the
    Binary Sets, in each of these Tables.  

    But, how can such a dilemma be resolved? One way is by
    actual testing, through the use of equations, a move beyond
    the empirical analysis we have been using thus far. That is,
    using the results from each of the Tables, we can create
    equations, which can be used to validate our beliefs, one
    way or the other.




Chapter IV: Comparing the Results from 2 Different
                 Numbering Systems

    Before we can use any Equation, or different Numbering
    System, we must first define them, and agree to the
    Definition provided.

                       Definition II



 1. 'Binary Number': A 'Binary Number' is any Number, which
     can be derived, using only the Members or Elements from
     the 'Binary Set', {0,1}. A Binary Number is said to be a
     Number of the Base 2.   

 2. 'Natural Number': Is a 'Whole or Counting Number' derived from
     the 'Set of Integers', {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.  A Counting Number
     is said to be a 'Dec' Number or Decimal Number of the base
     10.    

 3. 'Equation': An 'Equation' is a Statement  of Equality, which may
     contain One or more Arithmetic Operators, that represents the
     relationship between 2 or more Quantities. 



    Needless to say, if we agree upon the definitions from
    Definition II, we can now create Equations, which would be an
    equal representation of both the Binary Set and the Set of
    Integers. This would produce the Results, as given by Tables
    IIa and Ia, which are generated respectively, from Table II
    and I. To it put more precisely, since the focus of our argument
    is only the Binary Representation; Note the ongoing scenario.
    That is, given the equations:



          eq.3    X^B = I, where B = Exponent and I = result

              or  

          eq.4    X^I = B, where I = Exponent and B = result

    Note:   Where "B = Binary representation", "I = Integer", 
            "F = Fraction" And "X" represents any Variable.

    In other words: "Is the Value of the Binary Representation
    given by the Value of the Exponent or the Result of the
    Equation itself?" Then, from Tables I and II we can generate
    their respective Tables, Ia and IIa, which would provide us with
    additional information. Where by:

    Just think! We have not completed the Table conversion for
    Table II, and already you can see a problem, which can quite
    easily be the conclusion that marks the End of the Modern
    Presentation for the Method of Enumeration for the Binary
    System. That is, the fall of the Modern presentation of the
    method for enumeration in the Binary System, can
    prematurely be concluded when viewing equations 1 and 2
    from Table Ia, because there exist a Mathematical
    Impossibility. However, prior to the hastily acceptance of any
    such evidence as being the final straw, we must first agree
    that the Binary and Integer Columns from Table Ia are the
    same, which are Equal to the Binary and Integer Columns
    from Table I.

    Nevertheless, continuing the analysis, observe the information
    corresponding to the Note under 'eq.4', which has 'X' defined as
    a Variable; from Table Ia, equations 1 and 2, we have:




                        eq.5  X^0 = 0^0 = 0








E Terrell                                                     [Page 15]

Logical Analysis of the Binary System                 February 13, 2002








    But! This is not possible, because equation 2 was defined as
    being Equal to '1'. That is, given by 'eq.6', we have:




                  eq.6  X^0 = 1; Where 'X' is not Equal to '0'. 




    Furthermore, since the value of the Exponent in the equation
    itself, can never produce a Result of Zero, and since any value
    other than 'Zero' assigned to the Base having an Exponential
    value equal to zero will always produce a Result Equal to '1'.
    We can conclude that there has not been any Mathematical
    Laws violated in this comparison, when 'X' was chosen as a
    Variable. Furthermore, taking note of the fact equations 3
    and 4 from 'Table Ia' are Equal, and that it has long since
    been held by the definition of a 'Binary Number', that is, it is
    DEFINED by an EXPONENTIAL Equation having a of Base 2.
    Then we can conclude that the series of Binary Numbers
    generated by Table I, and represented in Table Ia, is in fact
    wrong, because it is not Logically consistent, nor does it
    map in a 'One-to-One Correspondence' with the Equations
    they were derived from.

    In other words, you cannot derive the Binary Numbers listed
    under the Binary Representation Column, from the Equations
    listed under the Exponential Enumeration Column, which are
    given in Tables I and Ia. Nevertheless, our comparison is not
    finished, because there still remains Table IIa. Given by:

    Nevertheless, the analysis of 'Table IIa' produces the
    necessary results, from which it can be concluded without
    any doubts. That it expresses a relationship that represents
    the 'One-to-One Correspondence' existing between the Results
    from the Exponential Equation under Exponential Enumeration
    Column, with the 'One-to-One Correspondence' existing
    between the series generated and listed under the
    corresponding and respective Binary Representation and
    Positive Integer Columns. However, even this is not the
    announcement of the Finality, because we have not ascribed
    any Definitions, establishing some Equality. And there is still
    the question of the assignment of the starting point, which
    leads to the resounding question. 'What is the location and
    definition of 'Zero' relative to the established relationship
    generated by this 'One-to-One Correspondence'?'  


    In other words, when taking account the information derived
    from the analysis and comparison of all 4 Tables, and the
    foregoing conclusion regarding the choice of some starting
    point related to 'Zero'. We could create 2 additional Tables,
    derived respectively from Tables 'Ia and IIa', and eliminate the
    Binary Representation Column and its respective members.
    That is, we can change the focus of our analysis from the
    Binary System, and construct 2 Tables as described above, 
    to determine the correct starting point for enumerating in the
    Binary System when the Binary Representation Column and
    its respective members were again included in our analysis.

    any relationship existing between the members of the
    respective Exponential Enumeration, and Positive Integer
    columns. In fact, the analysis of  Table 'Ib', noting specifically
    rows 1 and 2, emphasizes the Mathematical Anomaly, which
    prevents the existence by definition, of any relationship
    denoting equality. Furthermore, it should also be very clear,
    that there cannot exist a 'One-to-One Correspondence'
    between the members of the respective columns either,
    because there is no consistency nor continuity between the
    individual entities comprising the rows listed under the
    columns. In other words, while we can arbitrarily establish
    equality between the Binary Numbers and the Integers, as
    depicted in Tables I, Ia, and Ib, which would maintain a
    'One-to-One' relationship with each other. The only equation
    defined by the Laws of Mathematics, which would logically
    support the existence of such a relationship, would be Linear.
    Or the Identity Equation, which bars the existence of the
    Binary Set. Hence, from the analysis of Tables I, Ia, and Ib,
    which includes the Mathematical Laws and the Principles of
    Logic, we cannot deduce nor derive any reason for the
    existence of the Binary Method for Enumeration as presented
    by its Modern interpretation.

                         [e.g. The Identity Equation;
                                  0 + 0 = 0,
                                  1 + 0 = 1,
                                  2 + 0 = 2,
                                      ... ,
                                  255 + 0 = 255]



    However,  this is not the case for Table IIb, which clearly
    displays a relationship existing between the members under
    the respective Exponential Enumeration, and Positive Integer
    columns. In other words, the Results generated by the
    exponential equations under the Exponential Enumeration
    column, map exactly in a 'One-to-One Correspondence' with
    the Integers under the Positive Integer column. In fact, any 
    analysis of Tables II, IIa, and IIb, and the conclusions derived
    above, would show this to be  an unquestionable conclusion.   

    Nevertheless, if you now question the Assignment of Element
    from the Binary Set, denoted by {0}, and represented as '00',
    which was equated to '1'. Then I would call your attention to a
    fact, which states that; 'Something cannot be derived from
    Nothing!'. In other words, by definition, a Binary Set, is a Set
    that contains 2 things, Members, or Elements. And while the
    graphical depiction for this particular Member has the same
    appearance as 'Zero' or the 'Null Set', it is not equal to either
    of them: 'Nor can it be!'. Especially since by the definition,
    'Zero' and the 'Null Set', cannot be used to create a Value
    greater than itself. Hence, the Binary Element denoted by {0},
    is not equal to either 'Zero' or the 'Null Set'. In other words,
    there is No such thing as a Binary Set having only 1 Member,
    as is the case depicted by Tables I, Ia, and Ib, because then it
    would not represent a Binary Set. Furthermore, since the only
    demand imposed by the Definition of the Binary Set, is that, it
    must contain 2 Things. Then what they are, as long as they are
    not empty, is a matter of arbitrary Choice. Therefore, the
    Mathematically Correct and Logical Derivation, which is the
    representation for the Binary Notation, that expresses the
    process of Enumeration (Counting), is given by Table IIa.

    However, if you remain in doubt regarding the conclusion
    above, please take note of the ongoing argument. Where by, it
    should be understood, that any Numbering System can be
    Derived, or Created, by First establishing a 'One-to-One
    correspondence' of the New Numbering System with that of


    the Integers (Or Any of the Set of Numbering Systems,
    which exist as Member of the Real Number Set.), then by
    setting each Mapped Entity Equal to the Corresponding Integer
    to which it initially maintained the 'One-to-One Correspondence'
    with. Now, we have created a New Numbering System. Next,
    we must TEST our New System using the Same Laws Derived
    from Mathematics, which are valid with the Numbering System
    we used to create our New Numbering System. If our New
    Numbering System Fails Under any of the Mathematical
    Laws, which are valid for the Numbering System that was used
    to create our New Numbering System, then we can conclude
    that the New Numbering System we Created is Invalid,
    Illogical, and Wrong. 


Chapter V: The Logician's Dialectic; Finalizing The Comparison


    First and foremost, we must agree to the present method as
    being the definition for the elements of the Binary Set; {0,1}.
    Please note the equation, as given by "eq.7 ":



                    eq.7:       Binary 0  =  the Integer 



    This is an established fact, as given in every explanation
    concerning Binary Enumeration. Which clearly means that the
    {0} element of the Binary Set, {0,1}, is equal to the Integer 0.
    The problem concerning this definition is that: "If any element
    or member of the Binary Set, defined by {0,1}, is equal to the
    Integer 0. What happens to the definition of the Null or Empty
    Set? "? In other words, if the Integer 0 implies the existence
    of a Nothing State, or the Condition of having Nothing, then
    there is a Contradiction between the Definitions of Existence
    and Non-Existence; having and Not having.

    Clearly this defines the perception of Dr. Warren Heisenberg
    and his Uncertainty Principle of Classical Physics. When trying
    to measure the Position and or Velocity of an Electron without
    effecting or changing either of these parameters during the
    analysis. Unfortunately, this particular situation is not as
    complex, because the tools and the object under consideration
    have no motion in which we would disturb, thus destroying our
    analysis. However, we must decide upon the correct definitions
    existing in Set Theory and those of the Set of Integers, which
    would resolve the dilemma regarding the definition of the Binary
    element denoted by {0}.
 
    In which case, the Zero Integer must be equated to the Null or
    Empty Set. Especially since, they both imply by definition,
    having Nothing, or the State of Emptiness. Consider for a
    moment, if you will, the foregoing example:


      "Let the Null Set {0} equal the Integer 0; as given by 'eq.8': 



                       eq.8   {0} NULL or Empty Set = 0"



        [From which it can be easily established that
         Binary 0 = NULL SET. Especially since, it
         follows by conclusion from the Axioms for Equality
         that if "A + B = Z" and "B + C = Z", then
         "A + C = Z": and "A = C". Hence, "eq.7 = eq.8".]



    Now, by definition, if this is indeed true, then "eq.8" is empty
    and has absolutely No Members. In which case, " eq.7 is
    equal to eq.8". Right? However, if this were the case, then the
    Binary Set would, and should be equal to the set "{1}", which
    has only One Member. Because enumerating the elements of
    any set means counting the Total Number of Members
    contained in the Set itself. And since, the Null element
    (Null Set) can be considered a member of every Set. If it is
    indeed empty, it is not countable, because there is nothing
    to count. It is, by definition, representing Absolutely nothing.
    In other words, you cannot count Nothing as being Something!
    That is, given by 'eq.9', the total Number of members or
    elements in the Binary Set must be equal to 2, because the
    definition of Binary, means 2.








E Terrell                                                     [Page 24]

Logical Analysis of the Binary System                 February 13, 2002











                        eq.9   {0,1} = 2 


    But, since the results of "eq.7 and eq.8", are those currently
    maintained and derived from the established definitions of Set
    Theory and those concerning the Binary System. Zero in its
    universal Definition, is indeed the Null Set, which means or
    implies a State of having nothing or No Elements. This would
    then imply that the actual representation of 'eq.9' would be
    that depicted by 'eq.10':


                        eq.10   {0,1} = 1 = {1}



    Now, we come full circle, because if "eq.9 is False" and
    "eq.10 is True", or if "eq.9 is True" and "eq.10 is False". Then,
    not only we have lost the Definition of Binary, which is not
    equal to, nor does it mean Unary. But, we also loose the
    Definition of Zero. This is because if you give a Value to
    Zero, then it is no longer Nothing, Void, or Empty. It would truly
    be or become Something, and that Something would be other
    than that which does the Definition of Zero itself define.

    Notwithstanding however, following the Current Definitions, or
    that which has been established for the Binary System. If you
    believe that which was established and given by "eq.9 ", as
    being correct, then that which can be deduced or concluded
    from the laws governing Set Theory, given by "eq.11", would
    also be true. Where by;




                               eq.9  {0,1} = 2 
    (Where 2 is the total number of members of the SET)


     Then 

      eq.11  {0} = 1 and {1} = 1, because {0} u {1} = {0,1} = 2

     (Where " U " represents the "UNION of the Sets... And the
       " 1 " on the Right Side of the Equal Sign represents the
       Total Number of Members [Count] Contained in the Set.)

    Which is indeed a contradiction! Because "eq.7", as well as
    "eq.8" maintains that "{0} = 0". And because the "Union" of
    any Set with the Null Set represents the "fundamental principle
    of Identity", the Null Set cannot be counted. Therefore, Binary
    Zero is 'Not Equal' to the Integer Zero, 0, nor is it Equal to the
    Null Set! And 'eq.11', as well as Table IIa, represents the true
    and accurate depiction of the Binary Set, denoted by {0,1}. 

    Now, oppose the presentation I have argued thus far, which
    provided a valid and logical reason, rendering the necessary
    justification for the rewriting the Method of Enumeration for the
    Binary System. And allow Binary Zero to Equal the Integer Zero!
    That is, assume that in all cases, 'e.g. 7, 8, and 9' are
    unconditionally True. Then this argument would now focus upon
    deciding, according to 'Tables Ia and IIa', which Value the
    Binary Representation actually represents. That is, given the
    equations:


                        eq.3  X^B = I = R,
                              where B = Exponent and I = result

     or  


                        eq.4  X^I = B = R,
                              where I = Exponent and B = result

        Note:   Where "B = Binary representation", 
                "I = Integer", "F = Fraction" and
                "X" represents any Variable. And in this case,
                "R" and "X" can never be equal to "F"
                (Some Fraction).

    The problem here however, when reviewing each of the Tables,
    since the Binary Number has been mapped to represent some
    Integer, is choosing the Table, which accurately represent the
    results depicted in the Column of Exponential Equations. That
    is, when results are compared with the results of the Columns
    representing the Binary Number mapped to some Integer. You
    will note however, that each Table uses a different equation to
    start or initialize their respective mappings. That is, Tables II
    and IIa consistency uses 'eq.3', which is the result of the
    equation representing an Integer. While Tables I and Ia, uses
    'eq.4'. This clearly causes a problem! Especially since, Tables
    I and Ia use both 'e.g. 3 and 4', eventually, to represent the
    relationship between the Binary System and the Integers.
    Which clearly shows no direct mapping or count with the
    total number of members in the Binary Set and the Set of
    Integers Represented by the Number Line. And this fact is
    established by equations 1 and 2 under the Exponential
    Enumeration Column of Table Ia.

    Where by, in both cases these equations center upon the
    value of the Exponent only. That is, not until equation 4,
    which changes the emphasis to that of the Result, that is
    governed by 'eq.3'. But, the problem with this method is that,
    equations 4 and 5 under the Exponential Enumeration Column,
    does not represent a Binary or Integer format, which was
    derived from using either 'e.g. 3 or 4'. If it did, it would be a


    repeat of equations 6 and 10 under the Exponential
    Enumeration Column. Now wouldn't it?

    I mean, what does the Binary Number Represent? Is it the
    Exponent in the equation? Or! Is it the Result? Clearly, this
    shows that the count or consistency between the Binary
    System and the Set of Integers has lost its logical Continuity,
    or that somebody has Just Plain Committed an Error.
    Nevertheless, these conditions do not exist in the results
    given by Tables II and IIa, because it consistently uses 'e.g. 3',
    which consistently maps the Result from the Exponential
    Enumeration Column with the respective Mappings of the
    'One-to-One' Correspondence existing between the
    Binary Numbers and the Integers.

    Hence, we can now conclude, Zero is a Set, which is a

    Subset of Every Set, and it is a Universal Set itself, that
    cannot have any value ascribed, because it has no value
    at all. What this means is that, Zero or the Null Set is a
    Subset of every Set and a Proper Subset of every Set except
    itself. In other words, while you can use Zero to represent the
    Null Set, and include it as a member of any Set. Only when it
    is a noted and visible Member, can it be counted. However, this
    count cannot ascribe any Value to Zero or the Null Set beyond
    the one-to-one Total, which is a count representing the Total
    Number of Visible Members Contained in the Set itself. In
    other words, Tables II and IIa represent the True and accurate
    depiction of the Binary Numbers, which are paired in a
    'One-to-One Correspondence' in a relationship denoting
    Equality, with the Integers. Therefore, the Modern
    representation of the Binary Numbers, and its Method for
    Enumeration is indeed, unquestionably wrong.



Appendix I: 2 Binary Systems? True, False, or Enlightenment

    It would not be, nor could it ever become the End, if the
    light at the end of the tunnel was to dim or go out. I 
    mean, you would continue your trek, and assume that
    only the night has caused the darkness, because the
    Sun has set. Wouldn't you? With this in mind, let's
    untangle, and delve deeper into the mysteries, now
    plaguing the Binary System.

    Beginning our quest however, accept as being only one
    side of the truth, the conclusions associated with the
    results presented by Tables II, IIa, and IIb. And accept
    as being the rigor establishing only the foundation for the
    argument in opposition, a partial truth, which is
    represented by the conclusions associated with the
    information derived and established by Tables I, Ia, and
    Ib. In other words, further analysis would not only result
    in another Table depicting a different view of the Modern
    Interpretation of Binary Enumeration, previously
    represented by Tables I, Ia, and Ib. But, it would also
    enhance and strengthen the acceptance of the foundation
    derived for the Alternate View of the Binary System.

    However, prior to any forthright Construction of Table Ic,
    following in sequence from Tables I, Ia, and Ib. It
    would facilitate the analysis of the logical argument, if we
    first reiterate the requirements that were logically developed,
    that established the foundational definitions and
    requirements, which would be the mandate for any Binary
    System to exist.


                              Binary Principles 


  1. Binary; Consisting of 2 Things, Elements, or Members.

  2. Zero and the Null Set are implied by the same definition

  3. Zero; Having no Quantity, Size, Members, or elements;
     representing a State of Condition of Nothingness.

  4. Binary Set; Consisting of 2 and only 2, Elements or
     Members.

  5. Union of Set; Combining the Elements or Members of 2 or
     more Sets, resulting in 1 Set containing the total, which
     represents the combined total of the Members from the
     initial Sets.

  6. 'Equality': A Relationship, which provides a means to
     establish an Identity between 2 or more Objects being
     compared.

  7. Binary Zero is represented by '00', since it is not empty, it
     is not equal to either the Zero Integer or the Null Set.


    Now if you are satisfied with the list of Principles derived from,
    and associated with the Binary System, with the exception of 7.
    We can construct Table Ic, which represents another view for
    the Modern Method of Binary Enumeration.

    Notice that Table Ic maintains the 'One-to-One' validity as Table
    IIa. However, as with Tables I and II, their differences remain the
    same. In fact, any comparison with Table IIa maintains the
    same validity, except for their different starting points. In other
    words, Table Ic and Table IIa are 2 distinct Numbering Systems,
    that use the Binary Notation in a 'One-to-One Pairing' with the
    Integers to define and establish equality.  

    "Do we now have 2 Binary Systems, establishing a slightly
    different, and yet, equal relationship with the Set of Integers?
    I mean, what do we have here? Is it possible to have 2
    distinct Binary Systems, whose difference represents a different
    'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers? Or are we to try once
    again, and decide, which one of the two Numbering Systems
    actually represents a True Binary System?"

    Following the same investigative analysis used in earlier
    chapters, we can depict this difference graphically. That is,
    if we were now to extrapolate from the respective Binary
    Notations, as it would be given by the Integers' additive
    method of progression, which produces the counting series
    using successive additions of 1. We could then generate a
    number line, denoting a 'One-to-One Mapping' with the
    Integers that would more accurately depict these noted
    distinctions. Given respectively by figures 3 and 4, we have:

    What the bottom row of numbers actually represents, is the
    total number of combinations, which will be generated from the
    Binary Set, {0,1}. However, these combinations are used in a
    way similar to the way the '1' is used in the Integers, which
    increments from right to left using and changing only the ' 0 or
    1' notations from the Binary Set to generate a series of Binary
    Numbers. In other words, they generate a series governed by
    the operation of addition. That is, given respectively by figures
    5 and 6, we have:



                        Fig 5.

                   {01}, {10}, {11}
                     2     3     4




                        Fig 6.

                {00}, {01}, {10}, {11}
                  1     2     3     4




    Well, how do you begin your count? I mean, if there are 5
    objects to be counted, would your count start with 'Zero' or
    'One'? Clearly, the Set of Integers from which the Counting
    Numbers were derived, was only a graphical depiction, to be
    used in such a way, as to render a picture of the Number to
    be represented, which used one or more of these members
    to achieve the desired result. And nothing more. In other words,
    the Set of Integers or Whole Numbers, maintains the additional
    distinction of being a short-hand representation for the Operation
    of Addition, from which the sequence of Numbers is derived from
    the Unary Set {1}.

    Furthermore, I am sure you observed from figure 5, that the
    equating of Binary Zero to the Integer Zero reduced the number
    of combinations resulting from the Binary Set. Which is
    actually the cause which produces the SHIFT in the
    'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers. I mean, the assignment
    of the Beginning Point for any Numbering Systems is very
    important, because it sets the starting point that will be used
    for counting.

    Moreover, further analysis of the resulting Combinations
    derived from both of the respective Binary Sets, using Tables
    Ic and IIa. Clearly shows the equality existing between each of
    these Sets, which is derived from the 'One-to-One Pairing'
    equating the Points on the Number Line, denoting the
    Integers, with the Binary Notations they respectively represent.
    If however, we mapped the results indicated by figures 5 and 6,
    using the respective mappings given by figures 3 and 4, we
    would establish the necessary proof for concluding, that the
    method derived for Counting using the Modern Interpretation is
    wrong. In other words, any 'One-to-One Mapping' with the
    Integers and the Combinations resulting from figures 5 and 6,
    would clearly show that the missing Set, given by the
    Combination {00}, would result in a inaccurate mapping
    denoting an Inequality with the Sequence of Counting Numbers
    derived from the Set of Integers; that is, the Set of Counting
    Numbers denoted by: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. In which case,
    the Universal Set " I ", for the Integers, would equal the Set
    denoted by:

               

                                 Fig 7.    

                 
                  x|x is an element of I = Integers
      { {...-10,...-5,-4,-3,-2,-1}  {0}  {1,2,3,4,5,...,10} }


    Where its number line mapping is given by:



                                  Fig 8.

     -10 + -9 ... -5 +... -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 ... 5 +... + 10

    Nevertheless, the System of counting presently being used is a
    UNARY System, from which the sequence of Counting begins with the
    Number '1', and continues its progression using successive
    additions of the Number '1' to derive the next or succeeding
    numbers. And while it maybe called or labeled as being something
    different (i.e. Decimal System), it is nevertheless Unary.
    Furthermore, while Zero, '0', is used in every Numbering System
    (denoting its' universal application), it is not itself, a Number.
    It is only a symbolic notation, which represents emptiness, or lack
    of an Object to which it refers. Hence, Binary by definition, means
    '2', and nothing more. Therefore, when considering the construction
    of any Numbering System that employs or uses Binary Notation, we
    must first realize that the first '4' numbers are derived from the
    Total Number of Possible Unique Combinations, which are related to
    and derived from, the Sequenced Numbers or Elements depicted as
    being Members of the Binary Set. And further conclude, that all
    other succeeding Binary Numbers are derived from these Combinations.
    In which case, since the Binary Set equals {0,1}, the total number
    of Unique Combinations equals the set {00, 01, 10, 11}, which
    respectively represents the first '4' Binary Numbers whose mapping
    with the Set of Integers starts with the Number '1'.


    Hence, the Correct Method for Enumeration in the Binary System is
    given by the Results displayed in Table IIa, and the Modern
    Interpretation for the Method of Enumeration in the Binary System is
    clearly wrong. But still, both methods clearly represent a Binary
    System. Notwithstanding however, while the conclusions derived with
    respect to each of these Systems remains unquestionably valid. It
    does not stop, nor prevent any decision regarding choice. In other
    words, for whatever reason, right or wrong, for now at least, it
    does not matter which Binary System is used. Because other than
    myself, no one has, or is capable of completing the necessary
    studies indicating some out come producing a harm, resulting from
    the effects for choosing the wrong System.
