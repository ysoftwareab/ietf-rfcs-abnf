Internet-Draft              URI Lists in SIP                  March 2004


1. Introduction

   Some services require a SIP UA to provide an application server with
   a set of URIs. For example, a UA creating a conference needs to
   provide the conference server with the participants. The same way, a
   UA requesting presence information from a set of users needs to
   provide the resource list server with the URIs of the users that
   belong to the list.

   These lists are typically configured using out-of-band methods. For
   instance, a UA can use XCAP [7] to create a list of URIs and to
   associate this list with a SIP URI (e.g., sip:myfriends@example.com).
   It can, then, send a SIP request (an INVITE or a SUBSCRIBE in our
   previous examples) to that SIP URI.

   Still, there is a need to create lists of URIs in an ad-hoc way and
   send them directly in a SIP message. Transporting the URI list in the
   SIP message that triggers the service usually helps reduce the
   service establishment time, and is useful for UAs that do not have
   access to a server to host their list (and they cannot act as a
   server themselves).

   In any case, the way the application server interprets the URI list
   received in the request is method specific.

   A UA creating a SIP request that needs to carry a URI list proceeds
   this way. It places the URI list (e.g., an XCAP resource list [4]) in
   a body part, and constructs a pointer to that body part (i.e., a
   Content-ID URL [2] that points to the body part that carries the URI
   list). Then, the UA places the pointer in a "list" URI parameter. The
   way the application server interprets the URI list received in the
   request is method specific.

2. Scope

   This document specifies how to associate a URI list with a SIP or
   SIPS URI using the "list" parameter. The base URI identifies, as
   usual, a resource (generally a service), which is further described
   by the associated URI list.

   SIP transport of URI lists that are not associated with a SIP or SIPS
   URI is outside the scope of this document. Note, in any case, that
   the syntax of a number of already defined SIP header fields (e.g.,
   Alert-Info, Call-Info, Contact, etc) allows them to carry a set of
   URIs.

Internet-Draft              URI Lists in SIP                  March 2004


3. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

4. Procedures at the User Agent

   A UA creating a SIP request that needs to carry a SIP or SIPS URI
   with an associated URI list MUST place the URI list in a body part,
   and MUST construct a pointer to that body part (i.e., a Content-ID
   URL [2] that points to the body part that carries the URI list).
   Then, the UA MUST place the pointer in a "list" URI parameter (which
   is defined in Section 6) of the SIP or SIPS URI.

   The following is an example of a Content-ID URL:


   cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com

   The body the previous Content-ID URI points to would be described by,
   among other header fields, the following Content-ID header field:


   Content-ID: <cn35t8jf02@example.com>

   Further procedures are method specific and are defined in separate
   documents. For example, the use of lists and the INVITE method is
   described in (draft-camarillo-sipping-adhoc-conferencing-00.txt), and
   the use of lists and SUBSCRIBE is defined in
   (draft-camarillo-sipping-adhoc-simple-00.txt).

   As for any other SIP request, the size of requests carrying URI lists
   MUST NOT exceed 1300 bytes, unless the user agent client has positive
   knowledge that the message will not traverse a congestion-unsafe link
   at any hop, or that the message size is at least 200 bytes less than
   the lowest MTU value found en route to the server.

5. URI List Format

   The default URI list format for SIP entities is the XCAP resource
   list format defined in [4]. So, SIP entities handling URI lists MUST
   support this format.

   Nevertheless, the XCAP resource list format provides features such as
   hierarchical lists and list's attributes that are not needed by many

   services, which only need to transfer a flat list of URIs from a
   client to a server. The amount of information that a URI list needs
   to carry between a client and a server is method specific.
   Additionally, the way a client and a server negotiate the amount of
   information needed for a particular service is method specific as
   well.

   A client invoking a particular service SHOULD NOT include more
   information in its URI list than the service requires. A server
   providing a particular service MAY discard any extra information
   which is received in a URI list from the client.

   The following is an example of a flat list without attributes.


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <resource-lists xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
     <list>
       <entry uri="sip:bill@example.com" />
       <entry uri="sip:joe@example.com" />
       <entry uri="sip:ted@example.com" />
       <entry uri="sip:bob@example.com" />
     </list>
   </resource-lists>

                           Figure 1: URI List


6. The SIP and SIPS URI List Parameter

   SIP and SIPS URIs that need to reference a URI list MUST carry a
   pointer to the URI list, as described in Section 4, in a "list" SIP
   and SIPS URI parameter. We define the "list" parameter for SIP and
   SIPS URIs so that it MUST contain a Content-ID URL [2] that points to
   a URI list. The ABNF of the "list" parameter is:
      list-param = "list=" absoluteURI

   The following is an example of a SIP URI with a list parameter
   pointing to a body part using a Content-ID URL [2]:

   sip:group@example.com;list=cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com

7. The Content-ID SIP Header Field

   The Content-ID MIME header field is defined in RFC 2045 [6]. We
   define here the same header field to be used in SIP messages. Without
   this definition, SIP messages with a single body could not reference
   it using Content-ID URLs (messages with multiple bodies use the

Internet-Draft              URI Lists in SIP                  March 2004


   definition RFC 2045 [6]). The ABNF of the SIP Content-ID header field
   is:
      Content-ID = "Content-ID" HCOLON msg-id

   RFC 2822 [3] defines msg-id in Section 3.6.4.

   The Content-ID value is used to uniquely identify a body. The
   Content-ID header field MAY appear in any SIP request or response
   that contains a body.

8. Pointing to External URI Lists

   UAs that want to use an external URI list, instead of sending it as a
   body part, SHOULD use the content indirection mechanism defined in
   [5]. Indirected body parts are equivalent and have the same treatment
   as in-line body parts.

   The content indirection mechanism has certain security properties,
   such as allowing the UA to provide a hash of the contents of the
   external list, that could not be provided if "list" parameters could
   point directly to external lists (e.g., using an HTTP URI).

9. Examples

   The following is an example of an INVITE request that carries a URI
   list in its body. The Request-URI of this INVITE contains a pointer
   to the body part carrying the list.


   INVITE sip:ad-hoc@example.com;list=cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com SIP/2.0

10. Security Considerations

   This document discusses how to carry URI lists in SIP messages. In
   some cases, the URIs in the lists may need to be kept private. It is
   RECOMMENDED that S/MIME is used to prevent a third party from viewing
   this information.

   Some application servers, on reception of a SIP message with a URI
   list, send SIP requests to the URIs in the list. Such an application
   server may have policies that limit the number of URIs in the list,
   as a very long list could be used in a denial of service attack to
   place a large burden on the application server to send a large number
   of SIP requests. In addition, it is RECOMMENDED that S/MIME is used
   to integrity protect the list contents to keep attackers from adding
   URIs to a list.

   An application server MUST authenticate and authorize any user that

Internet-Draft              URI Lists in SIP                  March 2004


   requests the application server to send requests to a list of URIs.
   Otherwise, a malicious client could use the application server to
   perform a denial of service attack. In any event, this risk also
   exists when a client sets up a URI list using out-of-band methods
   (e.g., XCAP) and sends a request to that list. Application servers
   MUST use authentication and authorization mechanisms with equivalent
   security properties when sending requests to URI lists created using
   out-of-band and in-band methods.

11. IANA Considerations

   This document registers the "list" SIP and SIPS URI parameter, which
   is described in Section 6. This parameter is to be added to the SIP
   and SIPS URI parameter registry under http://www.iana.org/ TBD.

   This document registers the Content-ID SIP header field, which is
   described in Section 7. This header field is to be added to the
   header field registry under http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   sip-parameters.
      Header Name: Content-ID
      Compact Form: (none)
