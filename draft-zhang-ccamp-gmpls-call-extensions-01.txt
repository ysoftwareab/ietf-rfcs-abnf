Abstract 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource 
   ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are 
   used to support Calls. Although it is stated that these mechanisms 
   are applicable to any environment (including multi-area), the "Call 
   Path" is determined hop-by-hop by each "Call Manager" in sequence 
   along the path of the Call.

1. Introduction 

   The concept of a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) 
   Call is introduced in [RFC4974]. A Call is an association between 
   endpoints and possibly between key transit points (such as network 
   boundaries) in support of an instance of a service. The requirements 
   of Calls and the RSVT-TE extensions in support of Calls are also 
   described in [RFC4974]. 

   A Call is usually established between end-points to verify polices 
   and authorization applied on these end-points. However, in a multi-
   domain environment, some key polices and authorization are usually

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE extensions to GMPLS Calls            July 2009 
    

   deployed on the corresponding domain border nodes (domain ingress or 
   egress nodes), so these border nodes are also involved in processing 
   the Call when the Call is going through these domains. These nodes 
   that process the Call are known as "Call Managers". 

   Although it is stated that the mechanisms proposed in [RFC4974] are 
   applicable to any environment (including multi-area), the "Call Path" 
   is determined hop-by-hop by each Call Manager in sequence along the 
   path of the Call. That is, each Call Manager forwards the Notify 
   message that is used to manage the Call to the next Call Manager 
   along the Call Path. The Notify messages are targeted at (i.e., carry 
   the IP address of) the next Call Manager, and the route that the 
   messages follow through the network to reach the next Call Manager is 
   not important. 

   However, it is desirable to allow the Call-initiator to determine the 
   Call Path and to signal it explicitly in some cases (especially in 
   the multi-domain case). 

   This document describes RSVP-TE signaling extensions to allow the 
   Call-initiator to identify the Call Path explicitly when transit Call 
   Managers (besides the Call-initiator and Call-terminator) are 
   involved in a Call. 

   Note that Call and Connection are separated in the signaling, and 
   Call procedures do not impact the Connection procedures, so this 
   document does not modify any Connection procedures defined in 
   [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [RFC4208], and other existing protocol family. 

2. Motivation 

   In some cases, it is desirable to set up a Call through not only the 
   Call-initiator and Call-terminator, but also some transit Call 
   Manager nodes (e.g., transit border domain nodes) to verify the 
   corresponding polices and authorization applied on these nodes. 

   For instance, in the multi-domain case as shown in Figure 1, there 
   are three interconnected domains. Nodes I, D11, and D12 are in Domain 
   1, and the nodes D11 and D12 are the border nodes. Nodes D21, D22, 
   D23, and D24 are the border nodes of Domain 2, and the internal nodes 
   of Domain 2 are not shown in the figure. Nodes D31, D32, and E are in 
   Domain 3, and the nodes D31 and D32 are the border nodes. 

   Policies and authorization are often applied in domain border nodes, 
   such as the nodes D11, D12, D21, D22, D23, D24, D31, and D32 in this 
   example. Therefore, in this case, when a Call between Call-initiator 
   (node I) and Call-terminator (node E) is going to be setup, the Call

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE extensions to GMPLS Calls            July 2009 
    

   should be processed in some domain border nodes (for example, the 
   nodes D11, D21, D23, D31 should process the Call when the Call Path 
   I-D11-D21-D23-D31-E is selected).  

   Note that in this case, there may be several alternative Call Paths 
   between Call-initiator and Call-terminator. For example, in the 
   Figure 1, the possible Call paths may be I-D11-D21-D23-D31-E or I-
   D12-D22-D24-D32-E, or some other path depending on the 
   interconnectivity across the domains.

                      Figure 1: Multi-domain Scenario 

   Note that how to determine the Call Path is out of the scope of this 
   document.  

   According to the Section 7.3.1 of [RFC 4974], it is already supported 
   that the third parties (i.e., non-end points such as External Call 
   Managers) are involved in the Call, but there is no mechanisms for 
   the Call-initiator to control the Call Path. The Call Path is 
   determined by each Call Manager in turn selecting the next Call 
   Manager on the path to the Call-terminator and forwarding the Notify 
   message that sets up the Call. 

   However, in the case of a multi-domain Call, commercial and policy 
   motivations normally play a role in selecting the Call Path. This 
   selection may be at a coarse level (for example, identifying which 
   domains should or should not be used), or may be at a finer level 
   (for example, identifying which Call Managers to use). Note that 
   there is no concept of specifying links or resources within the Call

   Path as the Call is an ordered association of Call Managers, and not 
   a data path in the network. 

   Therefore, it is desirable to allow full control for the Call-
   initiator, which means that the Call-initiator can identify the full 
   Call Path explicitly. Moreover, the management plane needs to be able 
   to identify the Call Path explicitly as an instruction to the Call-
   initiator. 

   This document defines protocol extensions that provide a solution for 
   these requirements. 

3. Solution 

   In order to identify the Call Path explicitly for the Call-initiator, 
   the explicit Call Path can be specified by the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object 
   (ERO) [RFC3209]. 

   A new C_Type of ERO is suggested, C_Type = 2 (suggested, TBD by 
   IANA)), Call Explicit Route. 

   It is obvious that the Call Path can also be recorded by the 
   RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO) [RFC3209]. 

   A new C_Type of RRO is suggested, C_Type = 2 (suggested, TBD by IANA), 
   Call Record Route. 

   Note that the procedures of ERO and RRO for Call Path are similar as 
   defined in [RFC3209]. 

   The revised Notify message is as follows using the meta-language 
   described in [RBNF]: 

      <Notify message>  ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 

                            [[ <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>]...] 

                            [ <MESSAGE_ID> ] 

                            <ERROR_SPEC> 

                            <notify session list> 

   Where 

      <notify session list> ::= [ <notify session list> ]

                                <notify session> 

      <notify session>  ::= <SESSION> [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ] 

                            [ <POLICY_DATA>...] 

                            [ <LINK_CAPABILITY> ] 

                            [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ] 

                            [ <ERO> ] 

                            [ <RRO> ] 

                            [ <sender descriptor> | <flow descriptor> ] 

   And where: 

      <sender descriptor> ::= see [RFC3473] 

      <flow descriptor> ::= see [RFC3473] 

4. Operations 

   The processes for the revised Notify message comply with the 
   procedures described in [RFC3974] except that the ERO and RRO are 
   processed at the Call Managers. The processes for the ERO and RRO are 
   similar to the Connection ERO and RRO [RFC3209].  

   The procedures of Call Setup for the revised Notify message are 
   summarized as follows (other procedures are the same as [RFC3974]): 

   (1)The Call-initiator initiates Call setup and processes the Call 
      locally (e.g., verifies the policy, etc.). After that, it adds 
      the ERO to the Notify message, including the sub-objects to 
      identify the Call Path. If RRO is required, it also should add 
      RRO to the Notify message. Then the Call-initiator sends the 
      Notify message to the first Call Manager indicated by the first 
      sub-object of the ERO (Note that there is no Label Recording in 
      this case). 

   (2)The transit Call Managers process the Call when they receive the 
      Notify messages. After that, they remove themselves from the ERO. 
      If RRO is presented in the Notify message, it should also process 
      RRO similar to [RFC3209]. Then it sends the Notify message to the 
      next Call Manager identified by the ERO.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE extensions to GMPLS Calls            July 2009 
    

   (3)Step 2 recurs until the Notify message gets to the Call-
      terminator. And the corresponding Notify message returns to Call-
      initiator in the inverse direction (Note that the inverse Notify 
      message may include RRO object if needed, but it should not 
      include ERO object). 

   If, at any time, the ERO is absent or present but empty (for example, 
   when a transit Call Manager removes itself from the ERO), a Call 
   Manager MUST select a next Call Manager on the Call Path toward the 
   Call-terminator (identified in the Session object of the Notify 
   message). This next Call Manager may be another transit Call Manager 
   or may be the Call-terminator itself. The Call Manager MAY create a 
   new ERO if none exists to define hops to the Call-terminator, or may 
   add hops to the existing ERO between itself and the next hop in the 
   received ERO. Such actions are subject to local policy. 

4.1. User-Initiated Calls 

   The extensions in this document can also be applied in user-initiated 
   calls, although the example described in this document is about 
   network-initiated Call. Note that, in this case, the first node 
   within the first network domain may be responsible for specifying the 
   Call Path explicitly in the Notify message. The procedures should 
   comply with the description in the Section 7.2 of [RFC 4974]. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations about Call setup in single domain are 
   described in [RFC 4974]. In the case of multi-domain environment, the 
   security about Call is similar to that of Connection which is 
   described in [RFC 5151]. Therefore, please refer to the corresponding 
   Security Consideration sections in [RFC 4974] and [RFC 5151] to take 
   into account the security issues. 

6. Manageability Considerations 

   The mechanisms defined in this document call upon the use of policy 
   at Call Managers. Such policy SHOULD be available for configuration 
   by the operator either directly acting on the Call Manager or through 
   a policy server. Important information for the application of policy 
   is carried in the Call establishment messages (Notify messages) in 
   the Session, Session_Attributes, Sender_Template, Link_Capability, 
   and Policy_Data objects. 

   The mechanism used to determine the entire Call Path or next Call 
   Manager in a Call Path is beyond the scope of this document. One 
   solution is to allow configuration of the Call Path from the operator

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE extensions to GMPLS Calls            July 2009 
    

   as part of the service request (just as the explicit path of a label 
   switched path (LSP) can be specified by the operator). 

   Operators will expect to be able to inspect Call Managers and 
   determine for which Calls they are initiator, transit, or terminator. 
   Furthermore, they will expect to be able to inspect a Call at any 
   Call Manager that it uses, and determine all information about the 
   Call including its Call Path. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document introduces a new C_Type ERO and RRO. 

7.1. ERO Object  

   Class-Num = 20 

   C-Type=2 (suggested, TBD by IANA), Call Explicit Route 

   This type indicates that this ERO is used for Call messages in Notify 
   messages. 

7.2. RRO Object  

   Class-Num = 21  

   C-Type=2 (suggested, TBD by IANA), Call Record Route 

   This type indicates that this RRO is used for Call messages in Notify 
   messages. 

7.3. RSVP Error Codes and Error Values 

   The Call message (Notify message) should be rejected when any Call 
   Manager which receives the Call message including ERO does not 
   recognize the ERO. 

      o  Error Codes: 

         - Call Management (value 32) 

      o  Error Values: 

         - Call Management/Unknown ERO      (value=TBD)

   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of   
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be   
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology   
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license   
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it   
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any   
   such rights.

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF   
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or   
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or   
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or   
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR   
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement   
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please   
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org. 

   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or   
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are   
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into   
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions   
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions   
   is that published by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of   
   these Legal Provisions that are published by third parties, including   
   those that are translated into other languages, should not be   
   considered to be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions. 

   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards   
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of   
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the   
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms,   
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the   
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect and   
   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such   
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
