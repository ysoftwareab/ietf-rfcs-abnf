Introduction</h3>

<p>When there is a change to the network topology (due to the failure or
      restoration of a link or router, or as a result of management action)
      the routers need to converge on a common view of the new topology and
      the paths to be used for forwarding traffic to each destination. During
      this process, referred to as a routing transition, packet delivery
      between certain source/destination pairs may be disrupted. This occurs
      due to the time it takes for the topology change to be propagated around
      the network together with the time it takes each individual router to
      determine and then update the forwarding information base (FIB) for the
      affected destinations. During this transition, packets may be lost due
      to the continuing attempts to use the failed component, and due to
      forwarding loops. Forwarding loops arise due to the inconsistent FIBs
      that occur as a result of the difference in time taken by routers to
      execute the transition process. This is a problem that may occur in both
      IP networks and MPLS networks that use LDP <a class='info' href='#RFC5036'>RFC5036<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L., Minei, I., and B. Thomas, &ldquo;LDP Specification,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5036] as the label switched path (LSP)
      signaling protocol.
</p>
<p>The service failures caused by routing transitions are largely hidden
      by higher-level protocols that retransmit the lost data. However new
      Internet services could emerge which are more sensitive to the packet
      disruption that occurs during a transition. To make the transition
      transparent to their users, these services would require a short routing
      transition. Ideally, routing transitions would be completed in zero time
      with no packet loss.
</p>
<p>Regardless of how optimally the mechanisms involved have been
      designed and implemented, it is inevitable that a routing transition
      will take some minimum interval that is greater than zero. This has led
      to the development of a TE fast-reroute mechanism for MPLS <a class='info' href='#RFC4090'>[RFC4090]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pan, P., Swallow, G., and A. Atlas, &ldquo;Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. Alternative mechanisms that might be deployed
      in an MPLS network and mechanisms that may be used in an IP network are
      work in progress in the IETF <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rtgwg&#8209;ipfrr&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shand, M. and S. Bryant, &ldquo;IP Fast Reroute Framework,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. The repair mechanism
      may however be disrupted by the formation of micro-loops during the
      period between the time when the failure is announced, and the time when
      all FIBs have been updated to reflect the new topology.
</p>
<p>One method of mitigating the effects of micro-loops is to ensure that
      the network reconverges in a sufficiently short time that these effects
      are inconsequential. Another method is to design the network topology to
      minimise or even eliminate the possibility of micro-loops.
</p>
<p>The propensity to form micro-loops is highly topology dependent and
      algorithms are available to identify which links in a network are
      subject to micro-looping. In topologies which are critically susceptible
      to the formation of micro-loops, there is little point in introducing
      new mechanisms to provide fast re-route, without also deploying
      mechanisms that prevent the disruptive effects of micro-loops. Unless
      micro-loop prevention is used in these topologies, packets may not reach
      the repair and micro-looping packets may cause congestion loss.
</p>
<p>The disruptive effect of micro-loops is not confined to periods when
      there is a component failure. Micro-loops can, for example, form when a
      component is put back into service following repair. Micro-loops can
      also form as a result of a network maintenance action such as adding a
      new network component, removing a network component or modifying a link
      cost.
</p>
<p>This framework provides a summary of the mechanisms that have been
      proposed to address the micro-loop issue when sufficiently fast
      convergence is not available and the topology is susceptible to
      micro-loops.

The Nature of Micro-loops</h3>

<p>Micro-loops may form during the periods when a network is
      re-converging following ANY topology change, and are caused by
      inconsistent FIBs in the routers. During the transition, micro-loops may
      occur over a single link between a pair of routers that temporarily use
      each other as the next hop for a prefix. Micro-loops may also form when
      each router in a cycle of routers has the next router in the cycle as a
      next hop for a given prefix.
</p>
<p>Cyclic loops may occur if one or more of the following conditions are
      met:- </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Asymmetric link costs.
</li>
<li>The existence of an equal cost path between a pair of routers
          which make different decisions regarding which path to use for
          forwarding to a particular destination. Note that even routers which
          do not implement equal cost multi-path (ECMP) forwarding must make a
          choice between the available equal cost paths and unless they make
          the same choice the condition for cyclic loops will be
          fulfilled.
</li>
<li>Topology changes affecting multiple links, including single node
          and line card failures.
</li>
</ol><p> Micro-loops have two undesirable side-effects; congestion and
      repair starvation.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A looping packet consumes bandwidth until it either escapes as a
          result of the re-synchronization of the FIBs, or its TTL expires.
          This transiently increases the traffic over a link by as much as 128
          times, and may cause the link to become congested. This congestion
          reduces the bandwidth available to other traffic (which is not
          otherwise affected by the topology change). As a result the
          "innocent" traffic using the link experiences increased latency, and
          is liable to congestive packet loss.
</li>
<li>In cases where the link or node failure has been protected by a
          fast re-route repair, an inconsistency in the FIBs may prevent some
          traffic from reaching the failure and hence being repaired. The
          repair may thus become starved of traffic and thereby rendered
          ineffective.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Although micro-loops are usually considered in the context of a
      failure, similar problems of congestion loss and starvation may also
      occur if the topology change is the result of management action. For
      example, consider the case where a link is to be taken out of service by
      management action. The link can be retained in service throughout the
      transition, thus avoiding the need for any repair. However, if
      micro-loops form, they may cause congestion loss and may also prevent
      traffic from reaching the link.
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise controlled, micro-loops may form in any part of the
      network that forwards (or in the case of a new link, will forward)
      packets over a path that includes the affected topology change. The time
      taken to propagate the topology change through the network, and the
      non-uniform time taken by each router to calculate the new shortest path
      tree (SPT) and update its FIB contribute to the duration of the packet
      disruption caused by the micro-loops. In some cases a packet may be
      subject to disruption from micro-loops which occur sequentially at links
      along the path, thus further extending the period of disruption beyond
      that required to resolve a single loop.

Applicability</h3>

<p>Loop free convergence techniques are applicable to any situation in
      which micro-loops may form. For example the convergence of a network
      following:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Component failure.
</li>
<li>Component repair.
</li>
<li>Management withdrawal of a component.
</li>
<li>Management insertion or a component.
</li>
<li>Management change of link cost (either positive or negative).
</li>
<li>External cost change, for example change of external gateway as a
          result of a BGP change.
</li>
<li>A Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) failure.
</li>
</ol><p> In each case, a component may be a link, a set of links or an
      entire router. Throughout this document we use the term SRLG to describe
      the procedure to be followed when multiple failures have occurred
      whether or not they are members of an explicit SRLG. In the case of
      multiple independent failures, the loop prevention method described for
      SRLG may be used provided it is known that all of these failures have
      been repaired.
</p>
<p>Loop free convergence techniques are applicable to both IP networks
      and MPLS enabled networks that use LDP, including LDP networks that use
      the single-hop tunnel fast-reroute mechanism.
</p>
<p>An assessment of whether loop free convergence techniques are
      required should take into account whether or not the IGP convergence is
      sufficiently fast that any micro-loops are of such short duration that
      they are not disruptive, and whether or not the topology is such that
      micro-loops are likely to form.

Micro-loop Control Strategies</h3>

<p>Micro-loop control strategies fall into four basic classes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Micro-loop mitigation
</li>
<li>Micro-loop prevention
</li>
<li>Micro-loop suppression
</li>
<li>Network design to minimise micro-loops
</li>
</ol><p> A micro-loop mitigation scheme works by re-converging the
      network in such a way that it reduces, but does not eliminate, the
      formation of micro-loops. Such schemes cannot guarantee the productive
      forwarding of packets during the transition.
</p>
<p>A micro-loop prevention mechanism controls the re-convergence of the
      network in such a way that no micro-loops form. Such a micro-loop
      prevention mechanism allows the continued use of any fast repair method
      until the network has converged on its new topology, and prevents the
      collateral damage that occurs to other traffic for the duration of each
      micro-loop.
</p>
<p>A micro-loop suppression mechanism attempts to eliminate the
      collateral damage done by micro-loops to other traffic. This may be
      achieved by, for example, using a packet monitoring method, which
      detects that a packet is looping and drops it. Such schemes make no
      attempt to productively forward the packet throughout the network
      transition.
</p>
<p>Highly meshed topologies are less susceptible to micro-loops, thus
      networks may be designed to minimise the occurrence of micro-loops by
      appropriate link placement and metric settings. However, this approach
      may conflict with other design requirements such as cost and traffic
      planning and may not accurately track the evolution of the network, or
      temporary changes due to outages.
</p>
<p>Note that all known micro-loop prevention mechanisms and most
      micro-loop mitigation mechanisms extend the duration of the
      re-convergence process. When the failed component is protected by a fast
      re-route repair this implies that the converging network requires the
      repair to remain in place for longer than would otherwise be the case.
      The extended convergence time means any traffic which is NOT repaired by
      an imperfect repair experiences a significantly longer outage than it
      would experience with conventional convergence.
</p>
<p>When a component is returned to service, or when a network management
      action has taken place, this additional delay does not cause traffic
      disruption, because there is no repair involved. However the extended
      delay is undesirable, because it increases the time that the network
      takes to be ready for another failure, and hence leaves it vulnerable to
      multiple failures.

PLSN</h3>

<p>The only known purpose designed loop mitigation approach is the
        Path Locking with Safe-Neighbors (PLSN) method described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-microloop-analysis'>PLSN<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zinin, A., &ldquo;Analysis and Minimization of Microloops in Link-state Routing Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rtgwg&#8209;microloop&#8209;analysis]. In this
        method, a micro-loop free next-hop safety condition is defined as
        follows:
</p>
<p>In a symmetric cost network, it is safe for router X to change to
        the use of neighbor Y as its next-hop for a specific destination if
        the path through Y to that destination satisfies both of the following
        criteria:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>X considers Y as its loop-free neighbor based on the topology
            before the change AND
</li>
<li>X considers Y as its downstream neighbor based on the topology
            after the change.
</li>
</ol><p>In an asymmetric cost network, a stricter safety condition is
        needed, and the criterion is that:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>X considers Y as its downstream neighbor based on the topology
            both before and after the change.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on these criteria, destinations are classified by each router
        into three classes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Type A destinations: Destinations unaffected by the change
            (type A1) and also destinations whose next hop after the change
            satisfies the safety criteria (type A2).
</li>
<li>Type B destinations: Destinations that cannot be sent via the
            new primary next-hop because the safety criteria are not
            satisfied, but which can be sent via another next-hop that does
            satisfy the safety criteria.
</li>
<li>Type C destinations: All other destinations.
</li>
</ul><p>Following a topology change, Type A destinations are
        immediately changed to go via the new topology. Type B destinations
        are immediately changed to go via the next hop that satisfies the
        safety criteria, even though this is not the shortest path. Type B
        destinations continue to go via this path until all routers have
        changed their Type C destinations over to the new next hop. Routers
        must not change their Type C destinations until all routers have
        changed their Type A2 and Type B destinations to the new or
        intermediate (safe) next hop.
</p>
<p>Simulations indicate that this approach produces a significant
        reduction in the number of links that are subject to micro-looping.
        However unlike all of the micro-loop prevention methods it is only a
        partial solution. In particular, micro-loops may form on any link
        joining a pair of type C routers.
</p>
<p>Because routers delay updating their Type C destination FIB
        entries, they will continue to route towards the failure during the
        time when the routers are changing their Type A and B destinations,
        and hence will continue to productively forward packets provided that
        viable repair paths exist.
</p>
<p>A backwards compatibility issue arises with PLSN. If a router is
        not capable of micro-loop control, it will not correctly delay its FIB
        update. If all such routers had only type A destinations this loop
        mitigation mechanism would work as it was designed. Alternatively, if
        all such incapable routers had only type C destinations, the
        "loop-prevention" announcement mechanism used to trigger the tunnel
        based schemes (see sections 5.2 to 5.4) could be used to cause the
        Type A and Type B destinations to be changed, with the incapable
        routers and routers having type C destinations delaying until they
        received the "real" announcement. Unfortunately, these two approaches
        are mutually incompatible.
</p>
<p>Note that simulations indicate that in most topologies treating
        type B destinations as type C results in only a small degradation in
        loop prevention. Also note that simulation results indicate that in
        production networks where some, but not all, links have asymmetric
        costs, using the stricter asymmetric cost criterion actually REDUCES
        the number of loop free destinations, because fewer destinations can
        be classified as type A or B.
</p>
<p>This mechanism operates identically for both "bad-news" events,
        "good-news" events and SRLG failure.

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Incremental Cost Advertisement</h3>

<p>When a link fails, the cost of the link is normally changed from
        its assigned metric to "infinity" in one step. However, it can be
        proved that no micro-loops will form if the link cost is increased in
        suitable increments, and the network is allowed to stabilize before
        the next cost increment is advertised. Once the link cost has been
        increased to a value greater than that of the lowest alternative cost
        around the link, the link may be disabled without causing a
        micro-loop.
</p>
<p>The criterion for a link cost change to be safe is that any link
        which is subjected to a cost change of x can only cause loops in a
        part of the network that has a cyclic cost less than or equal to x.
        Because there may exist links which have a cost of one in each
        direction, resulting in a cyclic cost of two, this can result in the
        link cost having to be raised in increments of one. However the
        increment can be larger where the minimum cost permits. Recent work
        <a class='info' href='#OPT'>[OPT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Francois, P., Shand, M., and O. Bonaventure, &ldquo;Disruption free topology reconfiguration in OSPF           networks&quot;,&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a> has shown that there are a number of
        optimizations which can be applied to the problem in order to
        determine the exact set of cost values required and hence minimize the
        number of increments.
</p>
<p>It will be appreciated that when a link is returned to service, its
        cost is reduced in small steps from "infinity" to its final cost,
        thereby providing similar micro-loop prevention during a "good-news"
        event. Note that the link cost may be decreased from "infinity" to any
        value greater than that of the lowest alternative cost around the link
        in one step without causing a micro-loop.
</p>
<p>When the failure is an SRLG the link cost increments must be
        coordinated across all failing members of the SRLG. This may be
        achieved by completing the transition of one link before starting the
        next, or by interleaving the changes.
</p>
<p>The incremental cost change approach has the advantage over all
        other currently known loop prevention scheme that it requires no
        change to the routing protocol. It will work in any network because it
        does not require any co-operation from the other routers in the
        network.
</p>
<p>Where the micro-loop prevention mechanism is being used to support
        a planned reconfiguration of the network, the extended total
        reconvergence time resulting from the multiple increments is of
        limited consequence, particularly where the number of increments have
        been optimized. This, together with the ability to implement this
        technique in isolation, makes this method a good candidate for use
        with such management initiated changes.
</p>
<p>Where the micro-loop prevention mechanism is being used to support
        failure recovery, the number of increments required, and hence the
        time taken to fully converge, is significant even for small numbers of
        increments. This is because, for the duration of the transition, some
        parts of the network continue to use the old forwarding path, and
        hence use any repair mechanism for an extended period. In the case of
        a failure that cannot be fully repaired, some destinations may
        therefore become unreachable for an extended period. In addition the
        network may be vulnerable to a second failure for the duration of the
        controlled re-convergence.
</p>
<p>Where large metrics are used and no optimization (such as that
        described above) is performed, the incremental cost method can be
        extremely slow. However in cases where the per link metric is small,
        either because small values have been assigned by the network
        designers, or because of restrictions implicit in the routing protocol
        (e.g. RIP restricts the metric, and BGP using the AS path length
        frequently uses an effective metric of one, or a very small integer
        for each inter AS hop), the number of required increments can be
        acceptably small even without optimizations.

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Nearside Tunneling </h3>

<p>This mechanism works by creating an overlay network using tunnels
        whose path is not affected by the topology change and carrying the
        traffic affected by the change in that new network. When all the
        traffic is in the new, tunnel based, network, the real network is
        allowed to converge on the new topology. Because all the traffic that
        would be affected by the change is carried in the overlay network no
        micro-loops form.
</p>
<p>When a failure is detected (or a link is withdrawn from service),
        the router adjacent to the failure issues a new "loop-prevention"
        routing message announcing the topology change. This message is
        propagated through the network by all routers, but is only understood
        by routers capable of using one of the tunnel based micro-loop
        prevention mechanisms.
</p>
<p>Each of the micro-loop preventing routers builds a tunnel to the
        closest router adjacent to the failure. They then determine which of
        their traffic would transit the failure and place that traffic in the
        tunnel. When all of these tunnels are in place (determined, for
        example, by waiting a suitable interval) the failure is announced as
        normal. Because these tunnels will be unaffected by the transition,
        and because the routers protecting the link will continue the repair
        (or forward across the link being withdrawn), no traffic will be
        disrupted by the failure. When the network has converged these tunnels
        are withdrawn, allowing traffic to be forwarded along its new
        "natural" path. The order of tunnel insertion and withdrawal is not
        important, provided that the tunnels are all in place before the
        normal announcement is issued, and provided that the repair remains in
        place until normal convergence has completed.
</p>
<p>This method completes in bounded time, and is generally much faster
        than the incremental cost method. Depending on the exact design, it
        completes in two or three flood-SPF-FIB update cycles.
</p>
<p>At the time at which the failure is announced as normal,
        micro-loops may form within isolated islands of non-micro-loop
        preventing routers. However, only traffic entering the network via
        such routers can micro-loop. All traffic entering the network via a
        micro-loop preventing router will be tunneled correctly to the nearest
        repairing router, including, if necessary being tunneled via a
        non-micro-loop preventing router, and will not micro-loop.
</p>
<p>Where there is no requirement to prevent the formation of
        micro-loops involving non-micro-loop preventing routers, a single,
        "normal" announcement may be made, and a local timer used to determine
        the time at which transition from tunneled forwarding to normal
        forwarding over the new topology may commence.
</p>
<p>This technique has the disadvantage that it requires traffic to be
        tunneled during the transition. This is an issue in IP networks
        because not all router designs are capable of high performance IP
        tunneling. It is also an issue in MPLS networks because the
        encapsulating router has to know the label set that the decapsulating
        router is distributing.
</p>
<p>A further disadvantage of this method is that it requires
        co-operation from all the routers within the routing domain to fully
        protect the network against micro-loops.
</p>
<p>When a new link is added, the mechanism is run in "reverse". When
        the loop-prevention announcement is heard, routers determine which
        traffic they will send over the new link, and tunnel that traffic to
        the router on the near side of that link. This path will not be
        affected by the presence of the new link. When the "normal"
        announcement is heard, they then update their FIB to send the traffic
        normally according to the new topology. Any traffic encountering a
        router that has not yet updated its FIB will be tunneled to the near
        side of the link, and will therefore not loop.
</p>
<p>When a management change to the topology is required, again exactly
        the same mechanism protects against micro-looping of packets by the
        micro-loop preventing routers.
</p>
<p>When the failure is an SRLG, the required strategy is to classify
        traffic according the furthest failing member of the SRLG that it will
        traverse on its way to the destination, and to tunnel that traffic to
        the repairing router for that SRLG member. This will require multiple
        tunnel destinations, in the limiting case, one per SRLG member.

Farside Tunnels</h3>

<p>Farside tunneling loop prevention requires the loop preventing
        routers to place all of the traffic that would traverse the failure in
        one or more tunnels terminating at the router (or in the case of node
        failure routers) at the far side of the failure. The properties of
        this method are a more uniform distribution of repair traffic than is
        a achieved using the nearside tunnel method, and in the case of node
        failure, a reduction in the decapsulation load on any single
        router.
</p>
<p>Unlike the nearside tunnel method (which uses normal routing to the
        repairing router), this method requires the use of a repair path to
        the farside router. This may be provided by the not-via<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rtgwg&#8209;ipfrr&#8209;notvia&#8209;addresses]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shand, M., Bryant, S., and S.

Distributed Tunnels</h3>

<p>In the distributed tunnels loop prevention method, each router
        calculates its own repair and forwards traffic affected by the failure
        using that repair. Unlike the FRR case, the actual failure is known at
        the time of the calculation. The objective of the loop preventing
        routers is to get the packets that would have gone via the failure
        into Q-space <a class='info' href='#I-D.bryant-ipfrr-tunnels'>[I&#8209;D.bryant&#8209;ipfrr&#8209;tunnels]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryant, S., Filsfils, C., Previdi, S., and M. Shand, &ldquo;IP Fast Reroute using tunnels,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> using
        routers that are in P-space. Because packets are decapsulated on entry
        to Q-space, rather than being forced to go to the farside of the
        failure, more optimum routing may be achieved. This method is subject
        to the same reachability constraints described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.bryant-ipfrr-tunnels'>[I&#8209;D.bryant&#8209;ipfrr&#8209;tunnels]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryant, S., Filsfils, C., Previdi, S., and M.

Shand, &ldquo;IP Fast Reroute using tunnels,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>). If so
        the FIB entry can be immediately updated. For all of the remaining FIB
        entries, the router issues a new label to each of its neighbors. This
        new label is used to lock the path during the transition in a similar
        manner to the previously described loop-free convergence with tunnels
        method (<a class='info' href='#nearside-tunnel'>Section&nbsp;6.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nearside Tunneling </span><span>)</span></a>). Routers receiving a
        new label install it in their FIB, for MPLS label translation, but do
        not yet remove the old label and do not yet use this new label to
        forward IP packets. i.e. they prepare to forward using the new label
        on the new path, but do not use it yet. Any packets received continue
        to be forwarded the old way, using the old labels, towards the
        repair.
</p>
<p>At some time after the loop-prevention announcement, a normal
        routing announcement of the failure is issued. This announcement must
        not be issued until such time as all routers have carried out all of
        their loop-prevention announcement triggered activities. On receipt of
        the normal announcement all routers that were delaying convergence
        move to their new path for both the new and the old labels. This
        involves changing the IP address entries to use the new labels, AND
        changing the old labels to forward using the new labels.
</p>
<p>Because the new label path was installed during the loop-prevention
        phase, packets reach their destinations as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If they do not go via any router using a new label they go via
            the repairing router and the repair.
</li>
<li>If they meet any router that is using the new labels they get
            marked with the new labels and reach their destination using the
            new path, back-tracking if necessary.
</li>
</ul>

<p>When all routers have changed to the new path the network is
        converged. At some later time, when it can be assumed that all routers
        have moved to using the new path, the FIB can be cleaned up to remove
        the, now redundant, old labels.
</p>
<p>As with other method methods the new labels may be modified to
        provide loop prevention for "good news". There are also a number of
        optimizations of this method.

Ordered FIB Update </h3>

<p>The Ordered FIB loop prevention method is described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ordered-fib'>OFIB<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shand, M., Bryant, S., Previdi, S., and C. Filsfils, &ldquo;Loop-free convergence using oFIB,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rtgwg&#8209;ordered&#8209;fib]. Micro-loops occur
        following a failure or a cost increase, when a router closer to the
        failed component revises its routes to take account of the failure
        before a router which is further away. By analyzing the reverse
        shortest path tree (rSPT) over which traffic is directed to the failed
        component in the old topology, it is possible to determine a strict
        ordering which ensures that nodes closer to the root always process
        the failure after any nodes further away, and hence micro-loops are
        prevented.
</p>
<p>When the failure has been announced, each router waits a multiple
        of the convergence timer <a class='info' href='#I-D.atlas-bryant-shand-lf-timers'>[I&#8209;D.atlas&#8209;bryant&#8209;shand&#8209;lf&#8209;timers]<span> (</span><span class='info'>K, A. and S. Bryant, &ldquo;Synchronisation of Loop Free Timer Values,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. The multiple is
        determined by the node's position in the rSPT, and the delay value is
        chosen to guarantee that a node can complete its processing within
        this time. The convergence time may be reduced by employing a
        signaling mechanism to notify the parent when all the children have
        completed their processing, and hence when it is safe for the parent
        to instantiate its new routes.
</p>
<p>The property of this approach is therefore that it imposes a delay
        which is bounded by the network diameter although in many cases it
        will be much less.
</p>
<p>When a link is returned to service the convergence process above is
        reversed. A router first determines its distance (in hops) from the
        new link in the NEW topology. Before updating its FIB, it then waits a
        time equal to the value of that distance multiplied by the convergence
        timer.
</p>
<p>It will be seen that network management actions can similarly be
        undertaken by treating a cost increase in a manner similar to a
        failure and a cost decrease similar to a restoration.
</p>
<p>The ordered FIB mechanism requires all nodes in the domain to
        operate according to these procedures, and the presence of non
        co-operating nodes can give rise to loops for any traffic which
        traverses them (not just traffic which is originated through them).
        Without additional mechanisms these loops could remain in place for a
        significant time.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that this method requires per router ordering,
        but not per prefix ordering. A router must wait its turn to update its
        FIB, but it should then update its entire FIB.
</p>
<p>When an SRLG failure occurs a router must classify traffic into the
        classes that pass over each member of the SRLG. Each router is then
        independently assigned a ranking with respect to each SRLG member for
        which they have a traffic class. These rankings may be different for
        each traffic class. The prefixes of each class are then changed in the
        FIB according to the ordering of their specific ranking. Again, as for
        the single failure case, signaling may be used to speed up the
        convergence process.
</p>
<p>Note that the special SRLG case of a full or partial node failure,
        can be dealt with without using per prefix ordering, by running a
        single reverse SPF computation rooted at the failed node (or common
        point of the subset of failing links in the partial case).
</p>
<p>There are two classes of signaling optimization that can be applied
        to the ordered FIB loop-prevention method:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When the router makes NO change, it can signal immediately.
            This significantly reduces the time taken by the network to
            process long chains of routers that have no change to make to
            their FIB.
</li>
<li>When a router HAS changed, it can signal that it has completed.
            This is more problematic since this may be difficult to determine,
            particularly in a distributed architecture, and the optimization
            obtained is the difference between the actual time taken to make
            the FIB change and the worst case timer value. This saving could
            be of the order of one second per hop.
</li>
</ul>

<p>There is another method of executing ordered FIB which is based on
        pure signaling <a class='info' href='#SIG'>[SIG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Francois, P. and O. Bonaventure, &ldquo;Avoiding transient loops during IGP convergence,&rdquo; 2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. Methods that use signaling
        as an optimization are safe because eventually they fall back on the
        established IGP mechanisms which ensure that networks converge under
        conditions of packet loss. However a mechanism that relies on
        signaling in order to converge requires a reliable signaling mechanism
        which must be proven to recover from any failure circumstance.

<a name="rfc.section.6.8"></a><h3>6.8.&nbsp;
Synchronised FIB Update</h3>

<p>Micro-loops form because of the asynchronous nature of the FIB
        update process during a network transition. In many router
        architectures it is the time taken to update the FIB itself that is
        the dominant term. One approach would be to have two FIBs and, in a
        synchronized action throughout the network, to switch from the old to
        the new. One way to achieve this synchronized change would be to
        signal or otherwise determine the wall clock time of the change, and
        then execute the change at that time, using <a class='info' href='#RFC1305'>NTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., &ldquo;Network Time Protocol (Version 3) Specification, Implementation,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1992.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1305] to synchronize the wall clocks in the routers.
</p>
<p>This approach has a number of major issues. Firstly two complete
        FIBs are needed which may create a scaling issue and secondly a
        suitable network wide synchronization method is needed. However,
        neither of these are insurmountable problems.
</p>
<p>Since the FIB change synchronization will not be perfect there may
        be some interval during which micro-loops form. Whether this scheme is
        classified as a micro-loop prevention mechanism or a micro-loop
        mitigation mechanism within this taxonomy is therefore dependent on
        the degree of synchronization achieved.
</p>
<p>This mechanism works identically for both "bad-news" and
        "good-news" events. It also works identically for SRLG failure.
        Further consideration needs to be given to interoperating with routers
        that do not support this mechanism. Without a suitable interoperating
        mechanism, loops may form for the duration of the synchronization
        delay.

Using PLSN In Conjunction With Other Methods </h3>

<p>All of the tunnel methods and packet marking can be combined with
      PLSN (<a class='info' href='#PLSN-section'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>PLSN</span><span>)</span></a>)<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-microloop-analysis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rtgwg&#8209;microloop&#8209;analysis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zinin, A., &ldquo;Analysis and Minimization of Microloops in Link-state Routing Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> to reduce the traffic
      that needs to be protected by the advanced method. Specifically all
      traffic could use PLSN except traffic between a pair of routers both of
      which consider the destination to be type C. The type C to type C
      traffic would be protected from micro-looping through the use of a loop
      prevention method.
</p>
<p>However, determining whether the new next hop router considers a
      destination to be type C may be computationally intensive. An
      alternative approach would be to use a loop prevention method for all
      local type C destinations. This would not require any additional
      computation, but would require the additional loop prevention method to
      be used in cases which would not have generated loops (i.e. when the new
      next-hop router considered this to be a type A or B destination).
</p>
<p>The amount of traffic that would use PLSN is highly dependent on the
      network topology and the specific change, but would be expected to be in
      the region %70 to %90 in typical networks.
</p>
<p>However, PLSN cannot be combined safely with Ordered FIB. Consider
      the network fragment shown below:
</p>
<p>
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>                   R
                  /|\
                 / | \
               1/ 2|  \3
               /   |   \    cost S-&gt;T = 10
        Y-----X----S----T   cost T-&gt;S = 1
        |  1     2      |
        |1              |
        D---------------+
               20</pre></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On failure of link XY, according to PLSN, S will regard R as a safe
      neighbor for traffic to D. However the ordered FIB rank of both R and T
      will be zero and hence these can change their FIBs during the same time
      interval. If R changes before T, then a loop will form around R, T and
      S. This can be prevented by using a stronger safety condition than PLSN
      currently specifies, at the cost of introducing more type C routers, and
      hence reducing the PLSN coverage.

<a name="rfc.section.8"></a><h3>8.&nbsp;
Loop Suppression </h3>

<p>A micro-loop suppression mechanism recognizes that a packet is
      looping and drops it. One such approach would be for a router to
      recognize, by some means, that it had seen the same packet before. It is
      difficult to see how sufficiently reliable discrimination could be
      achieved without some form of per-router signature such as route
      recording. A packet recognizing approach therefore seems infeasible.
</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to recognize that a packet was
      looping by recognizing that it was being sent back to the place that it
      had just come from. This would work for the types of loop that form in
      symmetric cost networks, but would not suppress the cyclic loops that
      form in asymmetric networks, and as a result of multiple failures.
</p>
<p>This mechanism operates identically for both "bad-news" events,
      "good-news" events and SRLG failure.

Compatibility Issues </h3>

<p>Deployment of any micro-loop control mechanism is a major change to a
      network. Full consideration must be given to interoperation between
      routers that are capable of micro-loop control, and those that are not.
      Additionally there may be a desire to limit the complexity of micro-loop
      control by choosing a method based purely on its simplicity. Any such
      decision must take into account that if a more capable scheme is needed
      in the future, its deployment might be complicated by interaction with
      the scheme previously deployed.

Comparison of Loop-free Convergence Methods  </h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-microloop-analysis'>PLSN<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zinin, A., &ldquo;Analysis and Minimization of Microloops in Link-state Routing Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rtgwg&#8209;microloop&#8209;analysis] is an
      efficient mechanism to prevent the formation of micro-loops, but is only
      a partial solution. It is a useful adjunct to some of the complete
      solutions, but may need modification.
</p>
<p>Incremental cost advertisement in its simplest form is impractical as
      a general solution because it takes too long to complete. Optimized
      Incremental cost advertisement, however, completes in much less time and
      requires no assistance from other routers in the network. It is
      therefore, useful for network reconfiguration operations.
</p>
<p>Packet Marking is probably impractical because of the need to find
      the marking bit and to change the forwarding behavior.
</p>
<p>Of the remaining methods distributed tunnels is significantly more
      complex than nearside or farside tunnels, and should only be considered
      if there is a requirement to distribute the tunnel decapsulation
      load.
</p>
<p>Synchronised FIBs is a fast method, but has the issue that a suitable
      synchronization mechanism needs to be defined. One method would be to
      use <a class='info' href='#RFC1305'>NTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., &ldquo;Network Time Protocol (Version 3) Specification, Implementation,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1992.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1305], however the coupling of routing
      convergence to a protocol that uses the network may be a problem. During
      the transition there will be some micro-looping for a short interval
      because it is not possible to achieve complete synchronization of the
      FIB changeover.
</p>
<p>The ordered FIB mechanism has the major advantage that it is a
      control plane only solution. However, SRLGs require a per-destination
      calculation, and the convergence delay may be high, bounded by the
      network diameter. The use of signaling as an accelerator may reduce the
      number of destinations that experience the full delay, and hence reduce
      the total re-convergence time to an acceptable period.
</p>
<p>The nearside and farside tunnel methods deal relatively easily with
      SRLGs and uncorrelated changes. The convergence delay would be small.
      However these methods require the use of tunneled forwarding which is
      not supported on all router hardware, and raises issues of forwarding
      performance. When used with PLSN, the amount of traffic that was
      tunneled would be significantly reduced, thus reducing the forwarding
      performance concerns. If the selected repair mechanism requires the use
      of tunnels, then a tunnel based loop prevention scheme may be
      acceptable.
