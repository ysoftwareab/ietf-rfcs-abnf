Abstract

   This document defines requirements for adding certificate
   authentication to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2].  It is
   intended that potential solutions specifying certificate
   authentication within SIP will use these requirements as guidelines.
   Supporting certificate authentication in SIP would provide strong
   authentication and increase the types of possible deployment
   scenarios.

1.  Introduction


1.1.  Problem Statement

   Currently, SIP (RFC 3261) [2] only defines procedures for Digest
   authentication using a username/password.  Some organizations and
   service provicers may want to leverage existing Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI) investments for performing user authentication
   in SIP.  Adding certificates as an option for authentication in SIP
   provides stronger security and allows for new deployment scenarios.
   Although PKI has some constraints when attempting to solve user to
   user security, when the UA is authenticating to its Home Network
   (HN), it becomes a viable option for certain deployments.


1.2.  SIP Digest

   RFC 3261 [2] defines procedures for performing SIP Digest
   authentication using usernames and passwords.  It is based heavily on
   RFC 2617 [3].  SIP Digest is a challenge based mechanism for
   authentictaion.  Any time a UA or proxy server receives a request it
   may challenge the initiator of the request to provide assurance of
   its identity.  The message flow of SIP Digest during a registration
   is shown in Figure 1.

   Figure 1 SIP Digest Message Flow

   SIP Digest utilizes a challenge-response authentication mechansism
   that may be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a
   client to provide authentication information.  The Digest scheme
   challenges using a nonce value.  A valid response contains a checksum
   of the password, username, the provided nonce value, and other
   parameters.  As a result, the password is never sent in the clear.
   SIP Digest provides authentication and replay detection.  Because it
   is based on passwords, it suffers from the security weaknesses of
   password based systems.

1.3.  Related Work

   Although this document does not attempt to define a solution, related
   work exists in the IETF.  SIP Identity [5] provides a mechanism to
   cryptographically assure the identity of originators of SIP messages.
   It uses a private key and certificate associated with the domain
   indicated in the From header URI.  An authentication service
   authenticates the UAC and then inserts an Identity header and an
   Identity-Info header in the forwarded the request.  The
   Authentication Service is typically located at the outbound proxy and

   may authenticate the UAC using digest authentication or an existing
   TLS session.  The current SIP Identity solution does not meet all
   requirements as described in a later section, including the ability
   to pass certificates.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   This document borrows SIP related terminology as specified in RFC
   3261 [2].

3.  General Requirements

   The following are the general requirements for certificate
   authentication in SIP:

   1.   The messaging SHOULD conform to RFC 3261 [2].

   2.   A mechanism MUST exist for the endpoints to agree on the
        authentication to be used.

   3.   The protocol MUST prevent replay attacks, and the anti-replay
        mechansism MUST NOT rely on synchronized clocks.

   4.   Confidentiality MAY be required based on the contents of the
        certificates.

   5.   Relying parties MUST check the validity of certificates as
        defined in RFC 3280 [4].

   6.   The certificate MUST authenticate the endpoint.  There MUST be a
        mapping between the user and the certificate.  The certificate
        MUST contain enough data to allow this mapping.

   7.   The endpoint being authenticated SHOULD provide to the
        authenticator a list of roots it trusts.

   8.   The authenticator SHOULD provide to the endpoint being
        authenticated a list of roots it trusts.

   9.   Certificates MAY be exchanged during the authentication process,
        or MAY be obtained through other methods such as directories.
        If the certificate is not provided directly, it MUST be
        unambiguously referenced.

   10.  Mutual authentication MUST be supported.  Client-only
        authentication SHOULD be supported.

4.  Open Issues

   1.  Need to categorize requirements based on implementation/
       architecture.

   2.  Need to consider whether new SIP response codes are necessary.

   3.  Need to consider references to AIB, connected-identity, etc.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines the requirements for certificate-based
   authentication within SIP.  As such, it does not define a specific
   solution or set of technologies.  However, the eventual technical
   architecture meeting these requirements must consider the security of
   the solution.
