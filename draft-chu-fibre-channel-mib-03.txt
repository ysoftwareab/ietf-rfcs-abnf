Abstract

   This memo defines a module of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines the objects for managing the operations of
   the Node in the Fiber Channel Standard (defined in [1].)


1. Overview of the Managed Objects

   A Node consists of a collection of N_Ports.  These N_Ports are
   managed by a management agent residing in the Node.

   The managed objects are grouped by the categories of information they
   each carries.  The following groups of objects are defined.

                - the Configuration group
                - the Operation group
                - the Error group
                - the Accounting group

INTERNET DRAFT                FC Node MIB              February 27, 1995


   In each group, scalar objects and/or table entries are defined.  The
   Configuration group contains configuration and service parameters for
   the Node and the N_Ports within the Node.  The Operation group
   contains status parameters about the operations of the N_Ports.  The
   Error group contains counters recording the numbers of certain types
   of errors detected.  The Accounting group contains counters for
   certain events occurred in the N_Ports.
