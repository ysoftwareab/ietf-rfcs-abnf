Abstract

   This document describes an extension to vCard to support Instant
   Messaging (IM) and Presence Protocol (PP) applications.  IM and PP
   are becoming increasingly common ways of communicating, and users
   want to save this contact information in their address books.  It
   allows a URI that is associated with IM or PP to be specified inside
   of a vCard.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

   This work is being discussed on the imc-vcard@imc.org mailing list.


1.  Overview

   As more and more people use various instant messaging (IM) and
   presence protocol (PP) applications, it becomes important for them to
   be able to share this contact address information along with the rest
   of their contact information.  RFC 2425 [1] and RFC 2426 [2] define a
   standard format for this information, which is referred to as vCard.
   This document defines a new type in a vCard for representing instant
   IM and PP URIs.  It is very similar to existing types for
   representing email address and telephone contact information.

   The type entry to hold this new contact information is an IMPP type.
   The IMPP entry has a single URI (see RFC 3986 [3]) that indicates the
   address of a service that provides IM, PP, or both.  Also defined are
   some parameters that give hints as to when certain URIs would be
   appropriate.  A given vCard can have multiple IMPP entries, but each
   entry can contain only one URI.  Each IMPP entry can contain multiple
   parameters.  Any combination of parameters is valid, although a
   parameter should occur at most once in a given IMPP entry.

   The type of URI indicates what protocols might be usable for
   accessing it, but this document does not define any of the types.
   For example a URI type of

      "sip" [5] indicates to use SIP/SIMPLE,
      "xmpp" [6] indicates to use XMPP,
      "irc" [7] indicates to use IRC,
      "ymsgr" indicates to use yahoo,
      "msn" might indicate to use Microsoft messenger,
      "aim" indicates to use AOL, and
      "im" [8] or "pres" [9] indicates to use a CPIM or CPP gateway.

   The normative definition of this new vCard type is given in
   Section 2, and an informational ABNF is provided in Section 3.


2.  IANA Considerations

   The required email to define this extension (as defined in RFC2425)
   was sent on October 29, 2004 to the ietf-mime-direct@imc.org mailing
   list with the subject "Registration of text/directory MIME type IMPP"
   (see
   <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mime-direct/mail-archive/msg00068.html>).

Internet-Draft                 IMPP vCard                 September 2006


   This specification updates the "text/directory MIME Types"
   subregistry in the "text/directory MIME Registrations" registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/text-directory-registrations with the
   following information:

   Type name: IMPP

   Type purpose: To specify the URI for instant messaging and presence
   protocol communications with the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single URI.  The type of the URI indicates the protocol
   that can be used for this contact.

   Type special notes: The type may include the type parameter "TYPE" to
   specify an intended use for the URI.  The TYPE parameter values
   include one or more of the following:

   o  An indication of the type of communication for which this URI is
      appropriate.  This can be a value of PERSONAL or BUSINESS.
   o  An indication of the location of a device associated with this
      URI.  Values can be HOME, WORK, or MOBILE.
   o  The value PREF indicates this is a preferred address and has the
      same semantics as the PREF value in a TEL type.

   Additional information can be found in _RFCAAAA_.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   _[Note to IANA: Please replace AAAA with the RFC number for this
   specification.]_


3.  Formal Grammar

   The following ABNF grammar [4] extends the grammar found in RFC 2425
   [1] (Section 5.8.2) and RFC 2426 [2] (Section 4).

Internet-Draft                 IMPP vCard                 September 2006


   ;For name="IMPP"
    param      = impp-param ; Only impp parameters are allowed

    value      = URI
                 ; URI defined in Section 3 of [3]

    impp-param = "TYPE" "=" impp-type *("," impp-type)

    impp-type  = "PERSONAL" / "BUSINESS" / ; purpose of communications
                 "HOME" / "WORK" / "MOBILE" /
                 "PREF" /
                 iana-token / x-name;
                 ; Values are case insensitive


4.  Example


   BEGIN:vCard
   VERSION:3.0
   FN:Alice Doe
   IMPP;TYPE=personal,pref:im:alice@example.com
   END:vCard


5.  Security Considerations

   This does not introduce additional security issues beyond the current
   vCard specification.  It is worth noting that many people consider
   their presence information more sensitive than other address
   information.  Any system that stores or transfers vCards needs to
   carefully consider the privacy issues around this information.

Appendix B.  Since draft-jennings-impp-vcard-07.xml

   Update XMPP URI/IRI reference.

   Add and resolve issues "abnf-ref-normative", "clarify-type-
   recurrence" and "cite-rfc3986-for-URI".

Appendix C.  Resolved issues (to be removed by RFC Editor before
             publication)

   Issues that were either rejected or resolved in this version of this
   document.

C.1.  ref-rfc4622

   Type: edit

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-07-26): Update ref to XMPP URI/IRI
   spec.

   Resolution: Done.

C.2.  abnf-ref-normative

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-09-13): Ted Hardie: I believe
   citing the ABNF RFC as normative is also required.

   Resolution (2006-09-13): Done.

C.3.  cite-rfc3986-for-URI

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-09-13): Ted Hardie: This document
   apparently imports the definition of uri from 2425, which in turn
   says that URI is "as defined in 1738". 1738's description of URIs has
   long been superseded, and its formal description of genericurl (the
   closest thing to this) is in RFC822's BNF-like grammar, not ABNF.
   May I suggest this document cite RFC 3986 directly?  It's a full
   standard.

   Resolution (2006-09-13): Done.

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-09-14): Clarify that type
   parameter contains one or more values.

Appendix D.  Open issues (to be removed by RFC Editor prior to
             publication)

D.1.  edit

   Type: edit

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-06-25): Umbrella issue for
   editorial fixes/enhancements.

D.2.  irc-uri

   Type: edit

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-06-25): Take out reference to IRC
   URI draft (which is dead)?

D.3.  mention-other-approaches

   Type: edit

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-09-21): Lars Eggert (IESG
   discussion): Might want to mention that some vendors have already
   extended the vcard format to include IM addresses.

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2006-09-21): I think there are two
   sides to this: (1) is there a deployed format that we could use
   instead of inventing a new one, and (2) if we decide to invent a new
   one, should we discuss other approaches we rejected?  My take: (1)
   the format used by Apple (mentioned by Lars) assigns a new type for
   each IMPP URI scheme - that seems to be a bad idea as it doesn't
   allow clients to uniformly treat different IMPP systems without prior
   knowledge of what the URI scheme is.  So no, the format used by Apple
   doesn't seem to be a good idea.  As for (2), I'd like to avoid that
   additional work.  However I'm open to add minimal text mentioning
   other approaches if people make a concrete proposal for spec text.
