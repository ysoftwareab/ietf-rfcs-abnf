1. Abstract

   TMMH is a `universal' hash function suitable for message
   authentication in the Wegman-Carter paradigm, as in the Stream
   Cipher Security Transform.  It is simple, quick, and especially
   appropriate for Digital Signal Processors and other processors with
   a fast multiply operation, though a straightforward implementation
   requires storage equal in length to the largest message to be
   hashed.


2. TMMH

   TMMH is a simple hash function which maps a key and a message to a
   hash value.  There are two versions of TMMH: TMMH/16 and TMMH/32.
   TMMH/16 uses sixteen bit unsigned words as a basic data unit, while
   TMMH/32 uses thirty-two bit unsigned words.  TMMH can be used as a
   message authentication code, as described in Section 5.

Internet Draft     Truncated Multi-Modular Hash (TMMH)    November, 2001


   The key, message, and hash value are all octet strings, and the
   lengths of these quantities are denoted as KEY_LENGTH,
   MESSAGE_LENGTH, and TAG_LENGTH, respectively.  The values of
   KEY_LENGTH and TAG_LENGTH MUST be fixed for any particular fixed
   value of the key, and must obey the alignment restrictions
   described below.

   The parameter MAX_HASH_LENGTH, which denotes the maximum value which
   MESSAGE_LENGTH may take, is equal to KEY_LENGTH - TAG_LENGTH.


3. TMMH/16


   For TMMH/16, KEY_LENGTH and TAG_LENGTH MUST be a multiple of two.
   The key, message, and hash value are treated as a sequence of
   unsigned sixteen bit integers in network byte order.  (In this
   section, we call such an integer a word.)  If MESSAGE_LENGTH is
   odd, then a zero byte is appended to the message to align it on a
   word boundary, though this process does not change the value of
   MESSAGE_LENGTH.

   The words of the key are denoted as K[1], K[2], ..., K[KEY_WORDS],
   and the words of the message (after zero padding, if needed) are
   denoted as M[1], M[2], ..., M[MSG_WORDS], where MSG_WORDS is the
   smallest number such that 2 * MSG_WORDS is at least MESSAGE_LENGTH,
   and KEY_WORDS is KEY_LENGTH / 2.

   If MESSAGE_LENGTH is greater than MAX_HASH_LENGTH, then the value
   of TMMH/16 is undefined.  Implementations MUST indicate an error if
   asked to hash a message with such a length.  Otherwise, the hash
   value is defined to be the length TAG_WORDS sequence of words in
   which the j-th word in the sequence is defined as

   [ [ K[j] * MESSAGE_LENGTH +32 K[j+1] * M[1] +32 K[j+2] * M[2]
      +32 ... K[j+MSG_WORDS] * M[MSG_WORDS] ] modulo p ] modulo 2^16

   where j ranges from 1 to TAG_WORDS.

   Here, TAG_WORDS is equal to TAG_LENGTH / 2, and p is equal to
   2^16 + 1.  The symbol * denotes multiplication and the symbol +32
   denotes addition modulo 2^32.


3.1 Test Vectors

   This section provides test vectors which can be used to test an
   implementation of TMMH/16.  The key, message, and outputs are

   expressed as octet sequences, with each octet in hexadecimal.

   KEY_LENGTH: 10
   TAG_LENGTH: 2
   key: { 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0xfe, 0xdc }
   message: { 0xca, 0xfe, 0xba, 0xbe, 0xba, 0xde }
   output: { 0x9d, 0x6a }

   KEY_LENGTH: 10
   TAG_LENGTH: 2
   key: { 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0xfe, 0xdc }
   message: { 0xca, 0xfe, 0xba }
   output: { 0xc8, 0x8e }

   KEY_LENGTH: 10
   TAG_LENGTH: 4
   key: { 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0xfe, 0xdc }
   message: { 0xca, 0xfe, 0xba, 0xbe, 0xba, 0xde }
   output: { 0x9d, 0x6a, 0xc0, 0xd3 }


3.3 Implementation Notes

   The reduction modulo p can be implemented without the explicit use
   of a division operation, as it is close to 2^16 (See Section 3.1 of
   [MMH] for details).  The reduction modulo 2^16 can be implemented
   by truncating all but the lower sixteen bits of a higher-precision
   value.


4. TMMH/32

   TMMH/32 is defined analogously to TMMH/16, but with a thirty-two
   bit word size, with the following differences:

   * a word is four bytes in length, and the message is padded with as
     many zero octets as needed to make the message terminate on a
     word boundary,

   * the addition operations are done modulo 2^64,

   * TAG_WORDS is equal to TAG_LENGTH / 4, and MSG_WORDS is the
     smallest number such that 4 * MSG_WORDS is at least
     MESSAGE_LENGTH.

   * the prime p is 2^32+15 and the last modular reduction is modulo
     2^32 (rather than 2^16).

4.1 Test Vectors

   This section provides test vectors which can be used to test an
   implementation of TMMH/32.  The notation is as in Section 3.1.

   KEY_LENGTH: 12
   TAG_LENGTH: 4
   key: { 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab,
          0xcd, 0xef, 0xfe, 0xdc, 0xba, 0x98 }
   message: { 0xca, 0xfe, 0xba, 0xbe, 0xba, 0xde, 0xde, 0xed }
   output: { 0x43, 0x3f, 0x20, 0xed }

   KEY_LENGTH: 12
   TAG_LENGTH: 4
   key: { 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab,
          0xcd, 0xef, 0xfe, 0xdc, 0xba, 0x98  }
   message: { 0xca, 0xfe, 0xba, 0xbe, 0xba }
   output: { 0x20, 0xdc, 0xf6, 0x37 }



5. Using TMMH as a Message Authentication Code

   TMMH can be used to make a Wegman-Carter type message
   authentication code.  To use TMMH to compute the authentication tag
   of a message, the TMMH hash value of that message is computed, then
   that value is combined with a pseudorandom string of TAG_LENGTH
   octets.  The combining operation is word-wise addition modulo 2^16
   (for TMMH/16) or 2^32 (for TMMH/32).  The pseudoranom strings MUST
   NOT be correlated with each other nor with the messages they
   protect.

   A message/authentication tag pair can be verified as follows.
   Compute a new authentication tag using the algorithm above, and
   compare it to the tag associated with the message.  If the two are
   equal, then the message/tag pair is valid; otherwise, it is not.


6. Open Questions

   The alignment restriction on TAG_LENGTH could be eliminated by
   computing larger hash values, then truncating them to the desired
   length.  This generalization might be desirable for uses in which
   word alignment is unimportant and limitations on tag sizes are
   severe.  It is not clear if there is significant motivation for
   this case.

7. Security Concerns

   TMMH/16 is ((0.009568)^TAG_LENGTH)-Delta Universal with respect to
   subtraction modulo 2^16, and TMMH/32 is ((0.006114)^TAG_LENGTH)
   -Delta Universal with respect to subtraction modulo 2^32.  This
   property enables TMMH to be used as a message authentication code
   in the Wegman-Carter paradigm [WC81].

   These security claims for TMMH follow from the derivations in
   [MMH].  The interested reader should adapt Definition 2 of that
   document to TMMH as a starting point.

   The cyclic use of the words of the key is known as a Toeplitz
   construction, and is known to be secure (see Section 2.4 of [MMH]
   and the references therein).


8. History


   The second draft corrects one of the test vector cases, adds a
   section on using TMMH in a MAC, makes some scattered corrections
   and clarifications, and removes references to other Internet
   Drafts.

   TMMH is an extension on the MMH hash function [MMH].  Unlike the
   function introduced in that seminal work, TMMH can deal efficiently
   and securely with variable-length messages, and is defined for both
   sixteen and thirty-two bit words.

   The PacketCable Security specification includes a MMH variant for
   RTP authentication [PC].  This variant uses an insecure mechanism
   for message lengths less than the maximum value, and is not
   interoperable with TMMH.

   To the best knowledge of the authors, this specification is not
   covered by any patents [H01].
