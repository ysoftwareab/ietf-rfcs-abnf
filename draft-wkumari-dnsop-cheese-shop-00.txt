                Believing NSEC records in the DNS root.
                   draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop-00

Abstract

   This document cuts down on junk queries to the DNS root and improves
   performance by answering queries locally from compliant resolvers.
   It does this by actually believing the NSEC responses.

1.  Background

   [ This section may be removed before publication... but I'd prefer
   not, it provides useful context ]

   The title of this draft (draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop) comes from
   a famous Monty Python skit - "The Cheese Shop".  Knowledge of the
   skit is mandatory background knowledge for this document...

2.  Believing NSEC records.

   This is a simply a refinement of
   [I-D.fujiwara-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse], for a limited use case.
   Fiull credit to the authors of the aforementioned draft, and this
   draft does not replace that draft, nor remove the need for the
   broader consideration of the use of NSEC records as described in
   [I-D.fujiwara-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse].

   The scope of this document is addressed specifically to recursive
   validating resolvers when querying the root zone.

   If the (DNSSEC validated) answer to a query to a root server is an
   NXDOMAIN then the resolver SHOULD cache the NSEC record provided in
   the response.  The resolver should NOT send further queries for names
   within the range of the NSEC record for the lifetime of the cached
   NSEC TTL.  Instead, the resolver SHOULD answer these queries directly
   with NXDOMAIN (and NSEC records if so signalled by EDNS).  They
   SHOULD set the AA bit and AD bits.

2.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA considerations.

   [ We MAY want to add something about setting the NSEC TTL
   appropriately?! ]

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Fill this out!

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank some folk.
