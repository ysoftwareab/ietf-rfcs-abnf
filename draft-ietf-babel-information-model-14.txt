Abstract

   This Babel Information Model provides structured data elements for a
   Babel implementation reporting its current state and may allow
   limited configuration of some such data elements.  This information
   model can be used as a basis for creating data models under various
   data modeling regimes.  This information model only includes
   parameters and parameter values useful for managing Babel over IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol defined in
   [RFC8966].  [RFC8967] defines a security mechanism that allows Babel
   packets to be cryptographically authenticated, and [RFC8968] defines
   a security mechanism that allows Babel packets to be both
   authenticated and encrypted.  This document describes an information
   model for Babel (including implementations using one or both of these
   security mechanisms) that can be used to create management protocol
   data models (such as a NETCONF [RFC6241] YANG [RFC7950] data model).

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model              March 2021


   Due to the simplicity of the Babel protocol, most of the information
   model is focused on reporting Babel protocol operational state, and
   very little of that is considered mandatory to implement for an
   implementation claiming compliance with this information model.  Some
   parameters may be configurable.  However, it is up to the Babel
   implementation whether to allow any of these to be configured within
   its implementation.  Where the implementation does not allow
   configuration of these parameters, it MAY still choose to expose them
   as read-only.

   The Information Model is presented using a hierarchical structure.
   This does not preclude a data model based on this Information Model
   from using a referential or other structure.

   This information model only includes parameters and parameter values
   useful for managing Babel over IPv6.  This model has no parameters or
   values specific to operating Babel over IPv4, even though [RFC8966]
   does define a multicast group for sending and listening to multicast
   announcements on IPv4.  There is less likelihood of breakage due to
   inconsistent configuration and increased implementation simplicity if
   Babel is operated always and only over IPv6.  Running Babel over IPv6
   requires IPv6 at the link layer and does not need advertised
   prefixes, router advertisements or DHCPv6 to be present in the
   network.  Link-local IPv6 is widely supported among devices where
   Babel is expected to be used.  Note that Babel over IPv6 can be used
   for configuration of both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP014 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Notation

   This document uses a programming language-like notation to define the
   properties of the objects of the information model.  An optional
   property is enclosed by square brackets, [ ], and a list property is
   indicated by two numbers in angle brackets, <m..n>, where m indicates
   the minimal number of list elements, and n indicates the maximum
   number of list elements.  The symbol * for n means there are no
   defined limits on the number of list elements.  Each parameter and
   object includes an indication of "ro" or "rw". "ro" means the
   parameter or object is read-only. "rw" means it is read-write.  For
   an object, read-write means instances of the object can be created or
   deleted.  If an implementation is allowed to choose to implement a

   "rw" parameter as read-only, this is noted in the parameter
   description.

   The object definitions use base types that are defined as follows:

   binary      A binary string (sequence of octets).

   boolean     A type representing a Boolean (true or false) value.

   datetime    A type representing a date and time using the Gregorian
               calendar.  The datetime format MUST conform to RFC 3339
               [RFC3339] Section 5.6.

   ip-address  A type representing an IP address.  This type supports
               both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

   operation   A type representing a remote procedure call or other
               action that can be used to manipulate data elements or
               system behaviors.

   reference   A type representing a reference to another information or
               data model element or to some other device resource.

   string      A type representing a human-readable string consisting of
               a (possibly restricted) subset of Unicode and ISO/IEC
               10646 [ISO.10646] characters.

   uint        A type representing an unsigned integer number.  This
               information model does not define a precision.

3.  The Information Model

3.1.  Definition of babel-information-obj

   object {
        string                    ro babel-implementation-version;
        boolean                   rw babel-enable;

        string                    ro babel-metric-comp-algorithms<1..*>;
        string                    ro babel-security-supported<0..*>;
       [string                    ro babel-mac-algorithms<1..*>;]
       [string                    ro babel-dtls-cert-types<1..*>;]
       [boolean                   rw babel-stats-enable;]
       [operation                    babel-stats-reset;]
        babel-constants-obj       ro babel-constants;
        babel-interface-obj       ro babel-interfaces<0..*>;
        babel-route-obj           ro babel-routes<0..*>;
       [babel-mac-key-set-obj     rw babel-mac-key-sets<0..*>;]
       [babel-dtls-cert-set-obj   rw babel-dtls-cert-sets<0..*>;]
   } babel-information-obj;

   babel-implementation-version:  The name and version of this
      implementation of the Babel protocol.

   babel-enable:  When written, it configures whether the protocol
      should be enabled (true) or disabled (false).  A read from the
      running or intended datastore indicates the configured
      administrative value of whether the protocol is enabled (true) or

      not (false).  A read from the operational datastore indicates
      whether the protocol is actually running (true) or not (i.e., it
      indicates the operational state of the protocol).  A data model
      that does not replicate parameters for running and operational
      datastores can implement this as two separate parameters.  An
      implementation MAY choose to expose this parameter as read-only
      ("ro").

   babel-self-router-id:  The router-id used by this instance of the
      Babel protocol to identify itself.  [RFC8966] describes this as an
      arbitrary string of 8 octets.

   babel-self-seqno:  The current sequence number included in route
      updates for routes originated by this node.  This is a 16-bit
      unsigned integer.

   babel-metric-comp-algorithms:  List of supported cost computation
      algorithms.  Possible values include "2-out-of-3", and "ETX". "2-
      out-of-3" is described in [RFC8966], section A.2.1.  "ETX" is
      described in [RFC8966], section A.2.2.

   babel-security-supported:  List of supported security mechanisms.
      Possible values include "MAC" to indicate support of [RFC8967] and
      "DTLS" to indicate support of [RFC8968].

   babel-mac-algorithms:  List of supported MAC computation algorithms.
      Possible values include "HMAC-SHA256", "BLAKE2s-128" to indicate
      support for algorithms indicated in [RFC8967].

   babel-dtls-cert-types:  List of supported certificate types.
      Possible values include "X.509" and "RawPublicKey" to indicate
      support for types indicated in [RFC8968].

   babel-stats-enable:  Indicates whether statistics collection is
      enabled (true) or disabled (false) on all interfaces.  When
      enabled, existing statistics values are not cleared and will be
      incremented as new packets are counted.

   babel-stats-reset:  An operation that resets all babel-if-stats
      parameters to zero.  This operation has no input or output
      parameters.

   babel-constants:  A babel-constants-obj object.

   babel-interfaces:  A set of babel-interface-obj objects.

   babel-routes:  A set of babel-route-obj objects.  Contains the routes
      known to this node.

   babel-mac-key-sets:  A set of babel-mac-key-set-obj objects.  If this
      object is implemented, it provides access to parameters related to
      the MAC security mechanism.  An implementation MAY choose to
      expose this object as read-only ("ro").

   babel-dtls-cert-sets:  A set of babel-dtls-cert-set-obj objects.  If
      this object is implemented, it provides access to parameters
      related to the DTLS security mechanism.  An implementation MAY
      choose to expose this object as read-only ("ro").

3.2.  Definition of babel-constants-obj

   object {
        uint         rw babel-udp-port;
       [ip-address   rw babel-mcast-group;]
   } babel-constants-obj;

   babel-udp-port:  UDP port for sending and listening for Babel
      packets.  Default is 6696.  An implementation MAY choose to expose
      this parameter as read-only ("ro").  This is a 16-bit unsigned
      integer.

   babel-mcast-group:  Multicast group for sending and listening to
      multicast announcements on IPv6.  Default is ff02::1:6.  An
      implementation MAY choose to expose this parameter as read-only
      ("ro").

   babel-interface-reference:  Reference to an interface object that can
      be used to send and receive IPv6 packets, as defined by the data
      model (e.g., YANG [RFC7950], BBF [TR-181]).  Referencing syntax
      will be specific to the data model.  If there is no set of
      interface objects available, this should be a string that
      indicates the interface name used by the underlying operating
      system.

   babel-interface-enable:  When written, it configures whether the
      protocol should be enabled (true) or disabled (false) on this
      interface.  A read from the running or intended datastore
      indicates the configured administrative value of whether the
      protocol is enabled (true) or not (false).  A read from the
      operational datastore indicates whether the protocol is actually
      running (true) or not (i.e., it indicates the operational state of

      for running and operational datastores can implement this as two
      separate parameters.  An implementation MAY choose to expose this
      parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-interface-metric-algorithm:  Indicates the metric computation
      algorithm used on this interface.  The value MUST be one of those
      listed in the babel-information-obj babel-metric-comp-algorithms

      horizon optimization is used when calculating metrics on this
      interface.  A value of true indicates split horizon optimization
      is used.  Split horizon optimization is described in [RFC8966],
      section 3.7.4.  An implementation MAY choose to expose this
      parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-mcast-hello-seqno:  The current sequence number in use for
      multicast Hellos sent on this interface.  This is a 16-bit
      unsigned integer.

   babel-mcast-hello-interval:  The current interval in use for
      multicast Hellos sent on this interface.  Units are centiseconds.
      This is a 16-bit unsigned integer.

   babel-update-interval:  The current interval in use for all updates
      (multicast and unicast) sent on this interface.  Units are
      centiseconds.  This is a 16-bit unsigned integer.

   babel-mac-enable:  Indicates whether the MAC security mechanism is
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).  An implementation MAY choose
      to expose this parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-if-mac-keys-sets:  List of references to the babel-mac entries
      that apply to this interface.  When an interface instance is
      created, all babel-mac-key-sets instances with babel-mac-default-
      apply "true" will be included in this list.  An implementation MAY
      choose to expose this parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-mac-verify  A Boolean flag indicating whether MACs in incoming
      Babel packets are required to be present and are verified.  If
      this parameter is "true", incoming packets are required to have a
      valid MAC.  An implementation MAY choose to expose this parameter
      as read-only ("ro").

   babel-dtls-enable:  Indicates whether the DTLS security mechanism is
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).  An implementation MAY choose
      to expose this parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-if-dtls-cert-sets:  List of references to the babel-dtls-cert-
      sets entries that apply to this interface.  When an interface
      instance is created, all babel-dtls-cert-sets instances with
      babel-dtls-default-apply "true" will be included in this list.  An
      implementation MAY choose to expose this parameter as read-only
      ("ro").

   babel-dtls-cached-info:  Indicates whether the cached_info extension

      ServerHello packets.  The extension is included if the value is
      "true".  An implementation MAY choose to expose this parameter as
      read-only ("ro").

   babel-dtls-cert-prefer:  List of supported certificate types, in
      order of preference.  The values MUST be among those listed in the
      babel-dtls-cert-types parameter.  This list is used to populate
      the server_certificate_type extension (see [RFC8968] Appendix A)
      in a Client Hello.  Values that are present in at least one
      instance in the babel-dtls-certs object of a referenced babel-dtls
      instance and that have a non-empty babel-cert-private-key will be
      used to populate the client_certificate_type extension in a Client
      Hello.

   babel-packet-log-enable:  Indicates whether packet logging is enabled
      (true) or disabled (false) on this interface.

   babel-packet-log:  A reference or url link to a file that contains a
      timestamped log of packets received and sent on babel-udp-port on
      this interface.  The [libpcap] file format with .pcap file
      extension SHOULD be supported for packet log files.  Logging is
      enabled / disabled by babel-packet-log-enable.  Implementations
      will need to carefully manage and limit memory used by packet
      logs.

      received from this neighbor, or maximum value to indicate the IHU
      hold timer for this neighbor has expired.  See [RFC8966], section
      3.4.2.  This is a 16-bit unsigned integer.

   babel-exp-mcast-hello-seqno:  Expected multicast Hello sequence
      number of next Hello to be received from this neighbor.  If
      multicast Hello packets are not expected, or processing of
      multicast packets is not enabled, this MUST be NULL.  This is a
      16-bit unsigned integer; if the data model uses zero (0) to
      represent NULL values for unsigned integers, the data model MAY
      use a different data type that allows differentiation between zero
      (0) and NULL.

   babel-exp-ucast-hello-seqno:  Expected unicast Hello sequence number
      of next Hello to be received from this neighbor.  If unicast Hello
      packets are not expected, or processing of unicast packets is not
      enabled, this MUST be NULL.  This is a 16-bit unsigned integer; if
      the data model uses zero (0) to represent NULL values for unsigned
      integers, the data model MAY use a different data type that allows
      differentiation between zero (0) and NULL.

   babel-ucast-hello-seqno:  The current sequence number in use for
      unicast Hellos sent to this neighbor.  If unicast Hellos are not
      being sent, this MUST be NULL.  This is a 16-bit unsigned integer;
      if the data model uses zero (0) to represent NULL values for
      unsigned integers, the data model MAY use a different data type
      that allows differentiation between zero (0) and NULL.

   babel-ucast-hello-interval:  The current interval in use for unicast
      Hellos sent to this neighbor.  Units are centiseconds.  This is a
      16-bit unsigned integer.

   babel-rxcost:  Reception cost calculated for this neighbor.  This
      value is usually derived from the Hello history, which may be
      combined with other data, such as statistics maintained by the
      link layer.  The rxcost is sent to a neighbor in each IHU.  See
      [RFC8966], section 3.4.3.  This is a 16-bit unsigned integer.

   babel-cost:  The link cost, as computed from the values maintained in
      the neighbor table: the statistics kept in the neighbor table
      about the reception of Hellos, and the txcost computed from
      received IHU packets.  This is a 16-bit unsigned integer.

      How the metric is calculated is implementation-specific.  Maximum
      value indicates the route was recently retracted and is
      temporarily unreachable (see Section 3.5.5 of [RFC8966]).  At
      least one of babel-route-calculated-metric and babel-route-

   babel-route-feasible:  A Boolean flag indicating whether this route
      is feasible, as defined in Section 3.5.1 of [RFC8966]).

   babel-route-selected:  A Boolean flag indicating whether this route
      is selected (i.e., whether it is currently being used for

   babel-mac-key-name:  A unique name for this MAC key that can be used
      to identify the key in this object instance, since the key value
      is not allowed to be read.  This value MUST NOT be empty and can
      only be provided when this instance is created (i.e., it is not
      subsequently writable).  The value MAY be auto-generated if not
      explicitly supplied when the instance is created.

   babel-mac-key-use-send:  Indicates whether this key value is used to
      compute a MAC and include that MAC in the sent Babel packet.  A
      MAC for sent packets is computed using this key if the value is
      "true".  If the value is "false", this key is not used to compute
      a MAC to include in sent Babel packets.  An implementation MAY
      choose to expose this parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-mac-key-use-verify:  Indicates whether this key value is used
      to verify incoming Babel packets.  This key is used to verify
      incoming packets if the value is "true".  If the value is "false",
      no MAC is computed from this key for comparing with the MAC in an
      incoming packet.  An implementation MAY choose to expose this
      parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-mac-key-value:  The value of the MAC key.  An implementation
      MUST NOT allow this parameter to be read.  This can be done by
      always providing an empty string when read, or through
      permissions, or other means.  This value MUST be provided when
      this instance is created, and is not subsequently writable.  This
      value is of a length suitable for the associated babel-mac-key-
      algorithm.  If the algorithm is based on the HMAC construction
      [RFC2104], the length MUST be between 0 and an upper limit that is
      at least the size of the output length (where "HMAC-SHA256" output
      length is 32 octets as described in [RFC4868]).  Longer lengths
      MAY be supported but are not necessary if the management system
      has the ability to generate a suitably random value (e.g., by
      randomly generating a value or by using a key derivation technique
      as recommended in [RFC8967] Security Considerations).  If the
      algorithm is "BLAKE2s-128", the length MUST be between 0 and 32
      bytes inclusive as specified by [RFC7693].

      choose to expose this parameter as read-only ("ro").

   babel-mac-key-test:  An operation that allows the MAC key and MAC
      algorithm to be tested to see if they produce an expected outcome.
      Input to this operation are a binary string and a calculated MAC
      (also in the format of a binary string) for the binary string.
      The implementation is expected to create a MAC over the binary
      string using the babel-mac-key-value and the babel-mac-key-
      algorithm.  The output of this operation is a Boolean indication
      that the calculated MAC matched the input MAC (true) or the MACs
      did not match (false).

      only be provided when this instance is created, and is not
      subsequently writable.

   babel-cert-private-key:  The value of the private key.  If this is
      non-empty, this certificate can be used by this implementation to
      provide a certificate during DTLS handshaking.  An implementation
      MUST NOT allow this parameter to be read.  This can be done by
      always providing an empty string when read, or through
      permissions, or other means.  This value can only be provided when
      this instance is created, and is not subsequently writable.

4.  Extending the Information Model

   Implementations MAY extend this information model with other
   parameters or objects.  For example, an implementation MAY choose to
   expose Babel route filtering rules by adding a route filtering object
   with parameters appropriate to how route filtering is done in that
   implementation.  The precise means used to extend the information
   model would be specific to the data model the implementation uses to
   expose this information.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a set of information model objects and
   parameters that may be exposed to be visible from other devices, and
   some of which may be configured.  Securing access to and ensuring the
   integrity of this data is in scope of and the responsibility of any
   data model derived from this information model.  Specifically, any
   YANG [RFC7950] data model is expected to define security exposure of
   the various parameters, and a [TR-181] data model will be secured by
   the mechanisms defined for the management protocol used to transport
   it.

   Misconfiguration (whether unintentional or malicious) can prevent
   reachability or cause poor network performance (increased latency,
   jitter, etc.).  Misconfiguration of security credentials can cause a
   denial of service condition for the Babel routing protocol.  The
   information in this model discloses network topology, which can be
   used to mount subsequent attacks on traffic traversing the network.

   This information model defines objects that can allow credentials
   (for this device, for trusted devices, and for trusted certificate
   authorities) to be added and deleted.  Public keys may be exposed
   through this model.  This model requires that private keys and MAC
   keys never be exposed.  Certificates used by [RFC8968]
   implementations use separate parameters to model the public parts
   (including the public key) and the private key.

   MAC keys are allowed to be as short as zero-length.  This is useful
   for testing.  Network operators are RECOMMENDED to follow current
   best practices for key length and generation of keys related to the
   MAC algorithm associated with the key.  Short (and zero-length) keys
   are highly susceptible to brute force attacks and therefore SHOULD
   NOT be used.  See the Security Considerations section of [RFC8967]
   for additional considerations related to MAC keys.  The fifth
   paragraph of [RFC8967] Security Considerations makes some specific
   key value recommendations that should be noted.  It says that if it
   is necessary to derive keys from a human-readable passphrase, "only
   the derived keys should be communicated to the routers" and "the
   original passphrase itself should be kept on the host used to perform
   the key generation" (which would be the management system in the case
   of a remote management protocol).  It also recommends that keys
   "should have a length of 32 octets (both for HMAC-SHA256 and
   BLAKE2s), and be chosen randomly".

   This information model uses key sets and certification sets to
   provide a means of grouping keys and certificates.  This makes it
   easy to use a different set per interface, the same set for one or
   more interfaces, have a default set in case a new interface is
   instantiated and to change keys and certificates as needed.
