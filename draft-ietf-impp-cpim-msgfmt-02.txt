Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


1. INTRODUCTION

   This memo defines the mime content-type 'message/cpim.  This is a
   common message format for CPIM-compliant messaging protocols [14].

   While being prepared for CPIM, this format is quite general and may
   be reused by other applications with similar requirements.
   Application specifications that adopt this as a base format should
   answer the questions rasied in section 6 of this document.

1.1 Motivation

   The Common Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM) [14] specification
   defines a number of operations to be supported and criteria to be
   satisfied for interworking diverse instant messaging protocols.  The
   intent is to allow a variety of different protocols interworking
   through gateways to support cross-protocol messaging that meets the
   requirements of RFC 2779 [15].

   To adequately meet the security requirements of RFC 2779, a common
   message format is needed so that end-to-end signatures and encryption
   may be applied.  This document describes a common canonical message
   format that must be used by any CPIM-compliant message transfer
   protocol, and over which signatures are calculated for end-to-end
   security.

1.2 Background

   RFC 2779 requires that an instant message can carry a MIME payload
   [3,4];  thus some level of support for MIME will be a common element
   of any CPIM compliant protocol.  Therefore it seems reasonable that a
   common message format should use a MIME/RFC822 syntax, as protocol
   implementations must already contain code to parse this.

   Unfortunately, using pure RFC822/MIME [2] can be problematic:

   o  Irregular lexical structure -- RFC822 allows a number of optional
      encodings and multiple ways to encode a particular value.  For
      example RFC822 comments may be encoded in multiple ways.  For
      security purposes, a single encoding method must be defined as a
      basis for computing message digest values.  Protocols that
      transmit data in a different format would otherwise lose
      information needed to verify a signature.

   o  Weak internationalization -- RFC822 requires header values to use
      7-bit ASCII, which is problematic for encoding international
      character sets.  Mechanisms for language tagging in RFC822 headers
      [16] are awkward to use and have limited applicability.

   o  Mutability -- addition, modification or removal of header
      information.  Because it is not explicitly forbidden, many
      applications that process MIME content (e.g. MIME gateways)
      rebuild or restructure messages in transit.  This obliterates most
      attempt at achieving security (e.g. signatures), leaving receiving
      applications unable to verify the received data.

   o  Message and payload separation -- there is not a clear syntactic
      distinction between message metadata and message content.

   o  Limited extensibility (X-headers are problematic).

   o  No support for structured information (text string values only).

   o  Some processors impose line length limitations The message format
      defined by this memo overcomes some of these difficulties by
      having a syntax that is generally compatible with the format
      accepted by MIME/RFC822 parsers, but simplified, and having a
      stricter syntax.  It also defines mechanisms to support some
      desired features not covered by the RFC822/MIME format
      specifications.


1.3 Goals

   This specification aims to satisfy the following goals:

   o  a securable end-to-end format for a message (a canonical message
      format for signature calculation)

   o  independent of any specific application

   o  capable of conveying a range of different address types

   o  assumes an 8-bit clean message-transfer protocol

   o  evolvable:  extensible by multiple parties

   o  to clearly separate message metadata from message content

   o  a simple, regular, easily parsed syntax

   o  a compact, low-overhead format for simple messages

1.4 Terminology and conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

         NOTE:  Comments like this provide additional nonessential
         information about the rationale behind this document.
         Such information is not needed for building a conformant
         implementation, but may help those who wish to understand
         the design in greater depth.

   [[[Editorial comments and questions about outstanding issues are
   provided in triple brackets like this.  These working comments should
   be resolved and removed prior to final publication.]]]


2. OVERALL MESSAGE STRUCTURE

   The message/cpim format encapsulates an arbitrary MIME message
   content, together with message- and content-related metadata.  This
   can optionally be signed or encrypted using MIME security multiparts
   in conjunction with an appropriate security scheme.

   A message/cpim object is a multipart entity, where the first part
   contains the message metadata and the second part is the message
   content.  The two parts are syntactically separated by a blank line,
   to keep the message header information (with its more stringent
   syntax rules) separate from the MIME message content headers.

   Thus, the complete message looks something like this:

      m: Content-type: message/cpim
      s:
      h: (message-metadata-headers)
      s:
      e: (encapsulated MIME message-body)

   The end of the message body is defined by the framing mechanism of
   the protocol used.  The tags 'm:', 's:', 'h:', 'e:', and 'x:' are not
   part of the message format and are used here to indicate the
   different parts of the message, thus:

      m:  MIME headers for the overall message
      s:  a blank separator line
      h:  message headers
      e:  encapsulated MIME object containing the message content
      x:  MIME security multipart message wrapper

Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


2.1 Message/cpim MIME headers

   The message MIME headers identify the message as a CPIM-formatted
   message.  The only required header is:

      Content-type: message/cpim

   Other MIME headers may be used as appropriate for the message
   transfer environment.

2.2 Message headers

   Message headers carry information relevant to the end-to-end transfer
   of the message from sender to receiver.  Message headers MUST NOT be
   modified, reformatted or reordered in transit, but in some
   circumstances they MAY be examined by a CPIM message transfer
   protocol.

   The message headers serve a similar purpose to RFC822 message headers
   in email [2], and have a similar but restricted allowable syntax.

   The basic header syntax is:

      Key: Value

   where "Key" is a header name and "Value" is the corresponding header
   value.  The following considerations apply:

   o  The entire header MUST be contained on a single line.  The line
      terminator is not considered part of the header value.

   o  Only one header per line.  Multiple headers MUST NOT be included
      on a single line.

   o  Processors SHOULD NOT impose any line-length limitations.

   o  There MUST NOT be any whitespace at the beginning or end of a
      line.

   o  UTF-8 character encoding [21] MUST be used throughout.

   o  The character sequence CR,LF (13,10) MUST be used to terminate
      each line.

   o  The header name contains only US-ASCII characters (see later for
      the specific syntax)





Atkins & Klyne                                                  [Page 6]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   o  The header MUST NOT contain any control characters (0-31).  If a
      header value needs to represent control characters then the escape
      mechanism described below MUST be used.

   o  There MUST be a single space character (32) following the header
      name and colon.

   o  Multiple headers using the same key (header name) are allowed.
      (Specific header semantics may dictate only one occurrence of any
      particular header.)

   o  Headers names MUST match exactly (i.e. "From:" and "from:" are
      different headers).

   o  If a header name is not recognized or not understood, the header
      should be ignored.  But see also the "Requires:" header.

   o  Interpretation (e.g. equivalence) of header values is dependent on
      the particular header definition.  Message processors MUST
      preserve exactly all octets of all headers (both name and value).

   o  Message processors MUST NOT change the order of message headers.

   Examples:

      To: Pooh Bear <im:pooh@100akerwood.com>
      From: <im:piglet@100akerwood.com>
      Date: 2001-02-02T10:48:54-05:00

2.3 Character escape mechanism

   This mechanism MUST be used to code control characters in a header,
   having Unicode code points in the range U+0000 to U+001f or U+007f.
   (The escape mechanism is as used by the Java programming language.)
   Note that the escape mechanism is applied to a UCS-2 character, NOT
   to the octets of its UTF-8 coding.  Mapping from/to UTF-8 coding is
   performed without regard for escape sequences or character coding.
   (The header syntax is defined so that octets corresponding to control
   characters other than CR and LF do not appear in the output.)












Atkins & Klyne                                                  [Page 7]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   A UCS-2 character is escaped using the form:

      \uxxxx

   where:

      \    is U+005c (backslash)
      u    is U+0075 (lower case letter U)
      xxxx is a sequence of exactly four hexadecimal digits
           (0-9, a-f or A-F) or
           (U+0030-U+0039, U+0041-U+0046, or U+0061-0066)

   The hexadecimal number 'xxxx' is the UCS code-point value of the
   escaped character.

   Further, the following special sequences introduced by " used:

      \\   for \ (backslash, U+005c)
      \"   for " (double quote, U+0022)
      \'   for ' (single quote, U+0027)
      \b   for backspace (U+0008)
      \t   for tab (U+0009)
      \n   for linefeed (U+000a)
      \r   for carriage return (U+000d)

   Control and backslash characters (U+0000-U+001f, U+007f and U+005c)
   that occur in header data MUST be escaped.

   Quote characters that delimit a string value MUST NOT be escaped.

   On input, any backslash ('\') character MUST be interpreted as
   introducing an escape sequence.  Any unrecognized escape sequence
   MUST be treated as an instance of the character following the
   backslash character.

         NOTE: The use of an escape sequence to modify the
         interpretation of a non-control character in a header
         value depends on the specific syntax of the header value.
         It is RECOMMENDED that syntax of new header values is
         defined so that only those cases noted above (i.e.
         backslashes and quote characters) have modified
         interpretation when escaped.  Other characters can be
         protected by inclusion within a quoted string.  This
         approach will facilitiate the use of a standard parser
         for all headers.

Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


2.4 Message content

   The final section of a message/cpim is the MIME-encapsulated message
   content, which follows standard MIME formatting rules [3,4].

   The MIME content headers MUST include at least a Content-Type header.
   The content may be any MIME type.

   Example:

      e: Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
      e: Content-ID: <1234567890@foo.com>
      e:
      e: This is my encapsulated text message content


3. MESSAGE HEADER SYNTAX

   A header is made of two parts, a name and a value, separated by a
   colon character (':') followed by a single space (32), and terminated
   by a sequence of CR,LF (13,10).

   Headers use UTF-8 character encoding thoughout, per RFC 2279 [21].

3.1 Header names

   The header name is a sequence of US-ASCII characters, excluding
   control characters, SPACE or separator characters.  Use of the
   character "." in a header name is reserved for a namespace prefix
   separator.

   Separator characters are:

      SEPARATORS   = "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" / "@"
                   / "," / ";" / ":" / "
                   / "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" / "="
                   / "{" / "}" / SP


         NOTE:  the range of allowed characters was determined by
         examination of HTTP and RFC822 header name formats and
         choosing the more resticted.  The intent is to allow CPIM
         headers to follow a syntax that is compatible with the
         allowed syntax for both RFC 822 [2] and HTTP [18]
         (including HTTP-derived protocols such as SIP).

3.2 Header Value




Atkins & Klyne                                                  [Page 9]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   A header value has a structure defined by the corresponding header
   specification.  Implementations that use a particular header must
   adhere to the format and usage rules thus defined when creating or
   processing a message containing that header.

   The other general constraints on header formats MUST also be followed
   (one line, UTF-8 character encoding, no control characters, etc.)

3.3 Language Tagging

   Full internationalization of a protocol requires that a language can
   be indicated for any human-readable text [6,19].

   A message header may indicate a language for its value by including
   ';lang=tag' after the header name and colon, where 'tag' is a
   language identifying token per RFC 3066 [7].

   Example:

      Subject:;lang=fr Objet de message

   If the language parameter is not applied a header, any human-
   readable text is assumed to use the language identified as
   'i-default' [19].

3.4 Namespaces for header name extensibility

         NOTE: this section defines a framework for header
         extensibility whose use is optional.  If no header
         extensions are allowed by an application then these
         structures may never be used.

   An application that uses this message format is expected to define
   the set of headers that are required and allowed for that
   application.  This section defines a header extensibility framework
   that can be used with any application.

   The extensibility framework is based on that provided for XML [11] by
   XML namespaces [12].  All headers are associated with a "namespace",
   which is in turn associated with a globally unique URI.











Atkins & Klyne                                                 [Page 10]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   Within a particular message instance, header names are associated
   with a particular namespace through the presence or absence of a
   namespace prefix, which is a leading part of the header name followed
   by a period ("."); e.g.

      prefix.header-name: header-value

   Here, 'prefix' is the header name prefix, 'header-name' is the header
   name within the namespace associated with 'prefix', and
   'header-value' is the value for this header.

      header-name: header-value

   In this case, the header name prefix is absent, and the given
   'header-name' is associated with a default namespace.

   An application that uses this format designates a default namespace
   for any headers that are not more explicitly associated with any
   namespace.  In many cases, the default namespace may be all that is
   needed.

   A namespace is identified by a URI.  In this usage, the URI is used
   simply as a globally unique identifier, and there is no requirement
   that it can be used for any other purpose.  Any legal globally unique
   URI MAY be used to identify a namespace.  (By "globally unique", we
   mean constructed according to some set of rules so that it is
   reasonable to expect that nobody else will use the same URI for a
   different purpose.)  A URI used as an identifier MUST be a full
   absolute-URI, per RFC 2396 [10].  (Relative URIs and URI- references
   containing fragment identifiers MUST NOT be used for this purpose.)

   Within a specific message, a 'NS' header is used to declare a
   namespace prefix and associate it with a URI that identifies a
   namespace.  Following that declaration, within the scope of that
   message, the combination of namespace prefix and header name
   indicates a globally unique identifier for the header (consisting of
   the namespace URI and header name).  For example:

      NS: MyFeatures <mid:MessageFeatures@id.foo.com>
      MyFeatures.WackyMessageOption: Use-silly-font

   This defines a namespace prefix 'MyFeatures' associated with the
   namespace identifier 'mid:MessageFeatures@id.foo.com'.  Subsequently
   the prefix indicates that the WackyMessageOption header name
   referenced is associated with the identified namespace.

   A namespace prefix declaration MUST precede any use of that prefix.




Atkins & Klyne                                                 [Page 11]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   With the exception of any application-specific predefined namespace
   prefixes (see section 6), a namespace prefix is strictly local to the
   message in which it occurs.  The actual prefix used has no global
   significance.  This means that the headers:

      xxx.name: value
      yyy.name: value

   in two different messages may have exactly the same effect if
   namespace prefixes 'xxx' and 'yyy' are associated with the same
   namespace URI.  Thus the following have exactly the same meaning:

      NS: acme <http://id.acme.widgets/wily-headers/>
      acme.runner-trap: set

   and

      NS: widget <http://id.acme.widgets/wily-headers/>
      widget.runner-trap: set

   A 'NS' header without a header prefix name specifies a default
   namespace for subsequent headers;  that is a namespace that is
   associated with header names not having a prefix.  For example:

      NS: <http://id.acme.widgets/wily-headers/>
      runner-trap: set

   has the same meaning as the previous examples.

   This framework allows different implementers to create extension
   headers without the worry of header name duplication;  each defines
   headers within their own namespace.

3.5 Mandatory-to-recognize features

   Sometimes it is necessary for the sender of a message to insist that
   some functionality is understood by the recipient.  By using the
   mandatory-to-recognize indicator, a sender is notifying the recipient
   that it MUST understand the named header or feature in order to
   properly understand the message.

   A header or feature is indicated as being mandatory-to-recognize by a
   'Require:' header.  For example:

      Require: MyFeatures.VitalMessageOption
      MyFeatures.VitalMessageOption: Confirmation-requested





Atkins & Klyne                                                 [Page 12]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   Multiple required header names may be listed in a single 'Require'
   header, separated by commas.

         NOTE:  indiscriminate use of 'Require:' headers could
         harm interoperability.  It is suggested that any
         implementer who defines required headers also publish the
         header specifications so other implementations can
         succesfully interoperate.

   The 'Require:' header MAY also be used to indicate that some non-
   header semantics must be implemented by the recipient, even when it
   does not appear as a header.  For example:

      Require: Locale.MustRenderKanji

   might be used to indicate that message content includes characters
   from the Kanji repertoire, which must be rendered for proper
   understanding of the message.  In this case, the header name is just
   a token (using header name syntax and namespace association) that

3.6 Collected message header syntax

   The following description of message header syntax uses ABNF, per RFC
   2234 [17].  Most of this syntax can be interpreted as defining UCS
   character sequences or UTF-8 octet sequences.  Alternate productions
   at the end allow for either interpretation.

      Header       = Header-name ":" *( ";" Parameter ) SP
                     Header-value
                     CRLF

      Header-name  = [ Name-prefix "." ] Name
      Name-prefix  = Name

      Parameter    = Lang-param / Ext-param
      Lang-param   = "lang=" Language-tag
      Ext-param    = Param-name "=" Param-value
      Param-name   = Name
      Param-value  = Token / Number / String

      Header-value = *HEADERCHAR

   To interpret the syntax as defining UTF-8 coded octet sequences, use
   the following productions:

      UCS-no-CTL   = UTF8-no-CTL
      UCS-high     = UTF8-multi
      UTF8-no-CTL  = %x20-7e / UTF8-multi
      UTF8-multi   = %xC0-DF %x80-BF
                   / %xE0-EF %x80-BF %x80-BF
                   / %xF0-F7 %x80-BF %x80-BF %x80-BF

                   / %xFC-FD %x80-BF %x80-BF %x80-BF %x80-BF %x80-BF


4. HEADER DEFINITIONS

   This specification defines a core set of headers that are defined and
   available for use by applications:  the application specification
   must indicate the headers that may be used, those that must be
   recognized and those that must appear in any message (see section 6).

   The header definitions that follow fall into two categories:

   (a) those that are part of the CPIM format extensibility framework,
       and

   (b) some that have been based on similar headers in RFC 822,
       specified here with corresponding semantics.

   Header names and syntax are given without a namespace qualification,
   and the associated namespace URI is listed as part of the header
   description.  Any of the namespace associations already mentioned
   (implied default namespace, explicit default namespace or implied
   namespace prefix or explicit namespace prefix declaration) may be
   used to identify the namespace.

   All headers defined here are associated with the namespace URI
   <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>, which is defined according to [22].

Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


4.1 The 'From' header

   Indicates the sender of a message.

   Header name:   From

   Namespace URI: <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>

   Syntax: (see also section 3.6)

      From-header = "From" ": " [ Formal-name ] "<" URI ">"

   Description:

      Indicates the sender or originator of a message.

      If present, the 'Formal-name' identifies the person or "real
      world" name for the originator.

      The URI indicates an address for the originator.

   Examples:

      From: Winnie the Pooh <im:pooh@100akerwood.com>

      From: <im:tigger@100akerwood.com>

4.2 The 'To' header

   Specifies an intended recipient of a message.

   Header name:   To

   Namespace URI: <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>

   Syntax: (see also section 3.6)

      To-header = "To" ": " [ Formal-name ] "<" URI ">"

   Description:

      Indicates the recipient of a message.

      If present, the 'Formal-name' identifies the person or "real
      world" name for the recipient.

      The URI indicates an address for the recipient.




Atkins & Klyne                                                 [Page 16]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


      Multiple recipients may be indicated by including multiple 'To'
      headers.

   Examples:

      To: Winnie the Pooh <im:pooh@100akerwood.com>

      To: <im:tigger@100akerwood.com>

4.3 The 'cc' header

   Specifies a non-primary recipient ("courtesy copy") for a message.

   Header name:   cc

   Namespace URI: <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>

   Syntax: (see also section 3.6)

      Cc-header   = "cc" ": " [ Formal-name ] "<" URI ">"

   Description:

      Indicates a courtesy copy recipient of a message.

      If present, the 'Formal-name', if present, identifies the person
      or "real world" name for the recipient.

      The URI indicates an address for the recipient.

      Multiple courtesy copy recipients may be indicated by including
      multiple 'cc' headers.

   Examples:

      cc: Winnie the Pooh <im:pooh@100akerwood.com>

      cc: <im:tigger@100akerwood.com>

Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


4.4 The 'DateTime' header

   Specifies the date and time a message was sent.

   Header name:   Date

   Namespace URI: <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>

   Syntax:

      DateTime-header = "DateTime" ": " date-time

      (where the syntax of 'date-time' is a profile of ISO8601, defined
      in "Date and Time on the Internet" [23])

   Description:

      The 'Date' header supplies the current date and time at which the
      sender sent the message.

      One purpose of the this header is to provide for protection
      against a replay attack, by allowing the recipient to know when
      the message was intended to be sent.  The value of the date header
      is the current time at the sender when the message was
      transmitted, using ISO 8601 date and time format as profiles in
      "Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps" [23].

   Example:

      Date: 2001-02-01T12:16:49-05:00

4.5 The 'Subject' header

   Contains a description of the topic of the message.

   Header name:   Subject

   Namespace URI: <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>

   Syntax: (see also section 3.6)

      Subject-header = "Subject" ":" [ lang-param ] SP *HEADERCHAR

   Description:

      The 'Subject' header supplies the sender's description of the
      topic or content of the message.




Atkins & Klyne                                                 [Page 18]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


      The sending agent should specify the language parameter if it has
      any reasonable knowledge of the language used by the sender to
      describe the message.

   Example:

      Subject:;lang=en Eeyore's feeling very depressed today

4.6 The 'NS' header

   The "NS" header is used to declare a local namespace prefix.

   Header name:   NS

   Namespace URI: <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>

   Syntax: (see also section 3.6)

      NS-header = "NS" ": " [ Name-prefix ] "<" URI ">"

   Description:

      Declares a namespace prefix that may be used in subsequent header
      names.  See section 3.4 for more details.

   Example:

      NS: MyAlias <mid:MessageFeatures@id.foo.com>
      MyAlias.MyHeader: private-extension-data

4.7 The 'Require' header

   Specify a header or feature that must be implemented by the receiver
   for correct message processing.

   Header name:   NS

   Namespace URI: <[[[urn:iana:cpim-headers]]]>

   Syntax: (see also section 3.6)

      Require-header = "Require" ": " Header-name *( "," Header-name )

   Description:

      Declares a namespace prefix that may be used in subsequent header
      names. See section 3.5 for more details.

Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


      Note that there is no requirement that the required header
      actually be used, but for brevity it is recommended that an
      implemention not use issue require header for unused headers.

   Example:

      Require: MyAlias.VitalHeader


5. EXAMPLES

   The examples in the following sections use the following per-line
   tags to indicate different parts of the overall message format:

      m:  MIME headers for the overall message
      s:  a blank separator line
      h:  message headers
      e:  encapsulated MIME object containing the message content
      x:  MIME security multipart message wrapper

   The following examples also assume that <[[[urn:iana:cpim-
   headers]]]> is the implied default namespace for the application
   concerned.

5.1 An example message/cpim message

   The following example shows a message/cpim message:

      m: Content-type: message/cpim
      s:
      h: From: MR SANDERS <im:piglet@100akerwood.com>
      h: To: Depressed Donkey <im:eeyore@100akerwood.com>
      h: Date: 2000-12-13T13:40:00-08:00
      h: Subject: the weather will be fine today
      h: Subject:;lang=fr beau temps prevu pour aujourd'hui
      h: NS: MyFeatures <mid:MessageFeatures@id.foo.com>
      h: Require: MyFeatures.VitalMessageOption
      h: MyFeatures.VitalMessageOption: Confirmation-requested
      h: MyFeatures.WackyMessageOption: Use-silly-font
      s:
      e: Content-type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
      e: Content-ID: <1234567890@foo.com>
      e:
      e: <body>
      e: Here is the text of my message.
      e: </body>

5.2 An example using MIME multipart/signed

   In order to secure a message/cpim, an application or implementation
   should use RFC 1847 and some appropriate cryptographic scheme.

   Using S/MIME and pkcs7, the above message would look like this:

      x: Content-Type: multipart/signed; boundary=next;
                       MDALG=SHA-1; type=application/pkcs
      x:
      x: --next
      m: Content-Type: message/cpim
      s:
      h: From: MR SANDERS <im:piglet@100akerwood.com>
      h: To: Dopey Donkey <im:eeyore@100akerwood.com>
      h: Date: 2000-12-13T13:40:00-08:00
      h: Subject: the weather will be fine today
      h: Subject:;lang=fr beau temps prevu pour aujourd'hui
      h: NS: MyFeatures <mid:MessageFeatures@id.foo.com>
      h: Require: MyFeatures.VitalMessageOption
      h: MyFeatures.VitalMessageOption: Confirmation-requested
      h: MyFeatures.WackyMessageOption: Use-silly-font
      s:
      e: Content-type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
      e: Content-ID: <1234567890@foo.com>
      e:
      e: <body>
      e: Here is the text of my message.
      e: </body>
      x: --next
      x: Content-Type: application/pkcs7
      x:
      x: (signature stuff)
          :
      x: --next--


6. APPLICATION DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

   Applications using this specification must specify:

   o  a default namespace URI for messages created and processed by that
      application

   o  any namespace prefixes that are implicitly defined for messages
      created and processed by that application





Atkins & Klyne                                                 [Page 21]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   o  all headers that must be recognized by implementations of the
      application

   o  any headers that must be present in messages created by that
      application.

   o  any headers that may appear more than once in a message, and how
      they are to be interpreted (e.g. how to interpret multiple
      'subject:' headers with different language parameter values).

   Within a network of message transfer agents, an intermediate gateway
   MUST NOT change the message/cpim content in any way.  This implies
   that headers cannot be changed or reordered, transfer encoding cannot
   be changed, languages cannot be changed, etc.

   Because message/cpim messages are immutable, any transfer agent that
   wants to modify the message should create a new message/cpim message
   with the modified header and containing the original message as its
   content.  (This approach is similar to real-world bill-of-lading
   handling, where each person in the chain attaches a new sheet to the
   message.  Then anyone can validate the original message and see what
   was changed and who changed it by following the trail of amendments.
   Another metaphor is including the old message in a new envelope.)


7. IANA CONSIDERATIONS

   [[[Registration template for message/cpim content type]]]

   [[[Registration of namespace URN for CPIM headers]]]


8. INTERNATIONALIZATION CONSIDERATIONS

   Message headers use UTF-8 character encoding throughout, so can
   convey the full UCS-4 (Unicode, ISO/IEC 10646) character repertoire.

   Language tagging is provided for message headers using the "Language"
   parameter.

   Message content is any MIME-encapsulated content, and normal MIME
   content internationalization considerations apply.


9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   The message/cpim format is designed with security in mind.  In
   particular it is designed to be used with MIME security multiparts



Atkins & Klyne                                                 [Page 22]





Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   for signatures and encryption.  To this end, message/cpim messages
   must be considered immutable once created.

   Because message/cpim messages are binary messages (due to UTF-8
   encoding), if they are transmitted across non-8-bit-clean transports
   then the transfer agent must tunnel the entire message.  Changing the
   message data encoding is not an allowable option.  This implies that
   the message/cpim must be encapsulated by the message tranfer system
   and unencapsulated at the receiving end of the tunnel.

   The resulting message must have no data loss due to the encoding and
   unencoding of the message.  For example, an application may choose to
   apply the MIME base64 content-transfer-encoding to the message/cpim
   object to meet this requirement.

Appendix A: Amendment history

   00a 01-Feb-2001 Memo initially created.

   00b 06-Feb-2001 Editorial review.  Reworked namespace framework
                   description.  Deferred specification of mandatory
                   headers to the application specification, allowing
                   this document to be less application-dependent.
                   Expanded references.  Replaced some text with ABNF
                   syntax descriptions.  Reordered some major sections.

   00c 07-Feb-2001 Folded in some review comments.  Fix up some syntax
                   problems.  Other small editorial changes.  Add some
                   references.

Internet Draft             CPIM Message Format                  May 2001


   01a 29-Mar-2001 Incorporate review comments.  State (simply) that
                   this is a canonical end-to-end format for the purpose
                   of signature calculation.  Defined escape mechanism
                   for control characters.  Header name parameters
                   placed after the ":".  Changed name of Date: header
                   to DateTime:.  Revised syntax to separate character-
                   level syntax from UTF-8 octet- level syntax.

   01b 30-Mar-2001 State explicitly that unrecognized header names
                   should be ignored.  Remove text about
                   (non)significance of header order:  simply say that
                   order must be preserved.

   02a 30-May-2001 Updated reference to date/time draft.  Editorial
                   changes.


   TODO:

   o  confirm urn namespace for headers (currently depends on a work-
      in-progress).

   o  Complete IANA considerations


   REVIEW CHECKLIST:

   (Points to be checked or considered more widely on or before final
   review.)

   o  The desirability of a completely rigid syntax.

   o  Escape mechanism details.
