                  Designed Routing in BIER Forwarding
                draft-zhang-bier-designed-routing-01.txt

Abstract

   BIER specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast
   data packets.  As the [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] said, in the BIER
   domain, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building
   multicast distributing trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes
   to maintain any per-flow state.  In some deployments, some specific
   multicast flows may be forwarded by special routing; it cannot be
   achieved by the forwarding rule that is provided.  In this document
   we will defined a new routing list in BIER header, the packets will
   be steered according to the routing list.

1.  Introduction

   As the [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] described, BIER specifies a new
   architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets.  And the
   extension of OSPF/ISIS is used to flood the BIER information to
   establish the BIER forwarding table.  The calculation algorithm of
   IGP is calculating the shortest path to every BIER node.  It means
   that the forwarding in BIER is along the shortest path.

                        --------- B ------ C --------
                        |         |        |        |
                        A ------- D ------ E ------ F

                        --------- G ------ H --------
                    Figure 1: An example of packets forwarding

   For example, in figure 1, in the forwarding table of node A, here
   supposes that the shortest path to node C is node B, the shortest
   path to node H is node G.  If there is one specific multicast flow
   that should be forwarding to node C, node F and node H.  Then the
   forwarding path will be node A --- node B --- node C, node A--- node
   D --- node E --- node F, node A --- node G --- node H.  If we want to
   merge the flows in one optimizing path of node A --- node D --- node
   E --- node C/ node F/ node H, we cannot implement it due to the
   shortest forwarding algorithm.

Internet-Draft     Designed Routing in BIER Forwarding     November 2015


   This document specifies a way to forward multicast packets by
   designed routing.  These multicast packets are encapsulated by
   specific header.  The BIER nodes forward the packets by designed
   routing that is carried in specific BIER header.  In figure 1, node A
   send the packets with designed routing list.  The packets will be
   forwarded by the nodes list in the designed routing list of node A
   --- node D --- node E --- node C/ node F/ node H.

2.  Designed Routing

   The packets that are forwarded by BIER nodes are filled with designed
   routing in the BIER header, which carries the nodes list in order.
   The nodes are divided into differentiate levels that are classified
   by the distance from the ingress node.

2.1.  The node's level

                              ------- B ------ D ------ F
                              |
                              A-------C ------ E
                                    Figure 2

   For example, in figure2, node A is ingress node, the node F and node
   E are egress nodes.  Node B and C are the first level nodes that one
   specific multicast flow should be forwarded to, node D and E are the
   second level nodes that the flow should be forwarded to.  There is
   only one node F in the third level.

3.  Format of designed routing list

   The designed routing list that is followed by the BIER header should
   be distinguished by some specific flag in the BIER header.  One of
   the reserved bits may be used for the proposal.  When the rightmost
   bit of the reserved field is set to 1, it indicates that the designed
   routing list is followed by the BIER header of the packet.  As showed
   below:

   The designed routing list is comprised of a TLV, include type, length
   and value.  The type of TLV indicates the routing information and
   form.  There are many different types for the designed routing that
   may have many various formats, which may be expressed by bitstring,
   bfr-id list, or bfr-prefix list, and so on.  The following section
   defines how to use the bitstring to express the designed routing
   list.

3.1.  BitString

   The BitPosition(BP) is used to indicate the nodes in BIER header.
   And it can be used in the list of designed routing.  It's flexible to
   choose the corresponding BSL for packet's encapsulation.  So it's
   also flexible to encapsulate the list of designed routing.  The
   neighbor's format in the routing list should be used for two types.

3.1.1.  unified BSL

   Figure 4 illustrates using one unified BSL in the designed routing
   list, which means all level nodes in the list share the same BSL.

4.  Encapsulate the designed routing list

   When the ingress node gathers all the egress nodes in the BIER
   domain, it should encapsulate the BIER header as regular function
   first when traffic arrives.  If this traffic is classified to be
   forwarded by one designed routing, the ingress node then encapsulates
   the nodes' list in the designed routing list.  The designed routing
   list may be provided from the controller or the module of PCE, and so
   on.  The nodes in one same level should be encapsulated together.

                                    Figure 6

   For example, there are several nodes in one BIER domain.  Suppose
   that for one specific multicast flow, the ingress node is A, and the
   egress nodes are D, F and K.  The designed routing list is A-E-F-C-D,
   A-E-F-H-K.  What is more, node B is the shortest path next hop from A
   to D, node G is the shortest path next hop from A to K.

   The designed routing is divided into four levels, the first level
   includes node E.  The second level includes node F.  The third level
   includes node C and node H.  The fourth level includes node D and
   node K.

   Node A encapsulates all the nodes in the path to the designed routing
   list.  The current level is set to 1.

5.  Decapsulate the packet

   When the packet is forwarded to one of the egress nodes, the egress
   node will detect that it is one of the egress nodes due to the
   bitstring in the BIER header.  The egress nodes decapsulate the BIER
   header and forward it to the previous domain by reductive format.
   And if the egress node notices that there are still many nodes in the
   designed routing list that should be forwarded, the egress node will
   forward packets to next node due to the designed routing list.

6.  Forwarding treatment

   When the BIER nodes receive a packet that is encapsulated by BIER
   header and designed routing list extension, the BIER nodes will
   process the designed routing list in the BIER header and forward the
   packet according to the list.

   The current nodes receive a packet from the control plane or one
   previous node.  The current nodes will process the designed routing
   list due to the indication in the BIER header.  If there is no
   indication of designed routing list in the BIER header, the current
   nodes will forward the packet according to the BIER forwarding
   defined in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   If there is a designed routing list in the BIER header, the current
   nodes will forward the packet due to the rules below.

   At first, if the node is one of the egress nodes due to the BIER
   header, the nodes should decapsulate the packet and forward it to
   outside.

   Second, if the node detect that there is a designed routing list in
   the BIER header, the node will process the designed routing list, and
   forward the packet to the nodes in the list.  The detail of
   processing is described in the subsection.

   At last, the node increases the current level in the designed routing
   list, and forwards the packet to the next level nodes in the list.

6.1.  Process the designed routing list

   Step 1, the node gets the nodes' list in the designed routing list
   belong to current level.  For example, if the value of current level
   field is set to 1, then the node will get the nodes that are
   encapsulate in level 1.

   Step 2, the node looks up the BIER forwarding table and gets the
   table items which the next-hop are same to the nodes that get from
   the designed routing list.

   Step 3, the node copies the bitstring in the BIER header and updates
   it by AND'ing with all the table items.  After INVERSE the result, do
   And'ing with the original bitstring.  Then the result is reserved
   egress nodes.  It can be simplified to Rev-enodes.

   Step 4, the node update the origin bitstring by AND'ing with one item
   that are get from step2, and merge the result with the Rev-enodes,
   increase the current level field by 1 and forwards the packet to the
   next-hop of the item.  If there are several items get from step2, the
   node will do the processing with all the items.

   Every node in the designed routing list repeats the step, the packet
   will be forwarded by the nodes in the designed routing list.  At last
   the packet is forwarded to outside of the BIER domain.

   As the example of section 4,

   Suppose that the BitPositions for all nodes are:
   A(1),B(2),C(3),D(4),E(5),F(6),G(7),H(8), K(9).  And suppose that the
   BSL is 9.

                                  Figure 7

   The packet BIER header that is sent to D/F/K is encapsulated with
   100101000.  The path that we want the packet to travel is: E---F---C/
   H---D/K.  A is an ingress node, so the path list is escapsulated
   with: level1: E level2: F level3: C/H level4: D/K

   After OSPF/ISIS calculation, The BIER forwarding tables are:

   Node A:

   000001110 B

   000110000 E

   111000000 G

   Node C:

   111010011 B

   000001000 D

   000100000 F

   Node D:

   111110111 C

   Node E:

   111001111 A

   000100000 F

   Node F:

   001010011 E

   000001100 C

   110000000 H

   Node H:

   001011111 G

   000100000 F

   100000000 K

   Node K:

   011111111 H

   The header of packet is: 100101000.

   Now the process on node A is:

   1, A looks at the path list, and finds that E is next node, A picks
   out the routing item which next-hop is E from the forwarding table,
   get the item"000110000"; Because the node in this level is only F, so
   we only pick out one item of F.

   2, Use the header of packet"100101000" AND the item of E"000110000";
   the result is "000100000";

   3, Now INVERSE the result"000100000", will get "111011111".  Let we
   use the header "100101000" AND the "111011111", we get the "Rev-
   enodes""100001000";

   4, A is ready to forward the packet to E, according to the rule
   defined in BIER-arch, the header"100101000" AND the item which next-
   hop is E"000110000", and OR the "Rev-enodes" "100001000", the result
   is still "100101000", A sends the packet with the header"100101000"
   to E.

   The process on node E is:

   5, When E receives the packet with header"100101000", E look at the
   path list, fine that F is next node.  E pick out the routing item
   which next-hop is F from the forwarding table, get the
   item"000100000".  Because the node in this level is only F, so we
   only pick out one item of F.

   6, Use the header of packet"100101000" AND the item of F"000100000";
   the result is "000100000";

   7, Now INVERSE the result"000100000", will get "111011111".  Let we
   use the header"100101000" AND the "111011111", we get the "Rev-
   enodes""100001000";

   8, E is ready to forward the packet to F, according to the rule
   defined in BIER-arch, the header"100101000" AND the item which next-
   hop is F"000100000", and OR the "Rev-enodes""100001000", the result
   is still "100101000", E sends the packet with the header"100101000"
   to F.

   The process on node F is:

   9, When F receives the packet with header"100101000", at first F find
   that F itself is one of the egress nodes, after decapsulated and
   forwarded the packet out of BIER domain, F clears own bit in packet
   header, the header change to"100001000";

   10, F looks at the path list, find that C and H are next nodes.  F
   picks out the routing item which next-hop is C from the forwarding
   table, gets the item"000001100"; and F picks out the routing item
   which next-hop is H from the forwarding table, gets the
   item"110000000";

   11, Use the header of packet"100001000" AND the item of C"000001100";
   the result is "000001000".  And we use the header"100001000" AND the
   item of H"110000000"; the result is "100000000".  Because there are
   two results, so the mix result is "100001000".

   12, Now INVERSE the result"100001000", will get "011110111".  Let we
   use the header"100001000" AND the "011110111", we get the "Rev-
   enodes""000000000";

   13, F is ready to forward the packet to C, according to the rule
   defined in BIER-arch, the header "100001000" AND the item which next-
   hop is C"000001100", and OR the "Rev-enodes""000000000", the result
   is"000001000", F then sends the packet with the header"000001000" to
   C.

   14, similar to 13, F is ready to forward the packet to H, according
   to the rule defined in BIER-arch, the header"100001000" AND the item
   which next-hop is H"110000000", and OR the "Rev-enodes" "000000000",
   the result is"100000000", F then send the packet with the header
   "100000000" to H.

   The process on node C is:

   15, When the packet which header"000001000" reaches C, C will find
   that D and K are next nodes.  C picks out the routing item which

   next-hop is D from the forwarding table, gets the item"000001000".
   And there is no routing item which next-hop is K in the forwarding
   table, so we only get one item which next-hop is C.

   16, Use the header of packet"000001000" AND the item of C"000001000";
   the result is "000001000";

   17, Now INVERSE the result"000001000", will get "111110111".  Let we
   use the header"000001000" AND the "111110111", we get the "Rev-
   enodes""000000000";

   18, C is ready to forwards the packet to D, according to the rule
   defined in BIER-arch, the header"000001000" AND the item which next-
   hop is C"000001000", and OR the "Rev-enodes""000000000", the result
   is"000001000", C then send the packet with the header"000001000" to
   D.

   The process on node H is:

   19, similar to the process in node C, node H will send the packet
   with header"100000000" to K.

   The process on node D and K are:

   20, When the packet reaches D and K, the process is follow the rules
   defined in BIER-arch, the packet is decapsulated and forwarded out of
   BIER domain.

   The brief process is:

   Node A receives the packet from the control plane.  The current level
   field is 1.  Node A gets node E from the designed routing list due to
   the current level.  Then node A lookups the BIER forwarding table and
   gets the item which the next-hop is node E.

   Because the shortest path from node A to node D and K is not go
   through node E, so the node A will get the Rev-enodes that include
   node D and K due to the steps in section 6.1.  Node A forwards the
   packet to node E, with the bitstring in the BIER header is set to D,
   F and K, and the current level field is set to 2.

   Node E receives the packet from node A, finds the items from the BIER
   forwarding table which the next-hop is node F, do the same steps, set
   the current level field to 3, and then forwards the packet to F.

   Node F receives the packet from node E.  At first node F decapsulates
   the packet and forwards it outside of the BIER domain due to the
   bitstring in the BIER header.  Then node F finds the items from the

   BIER forwarding table which the next-hop is node C and H, does the
   same steps in section 6.1, increase the current level value and
   forward to node C and H.

   Node C and H receive the packet from node F separately, repeat the
   steps, increase the current level value to 4 and forwards it to node
   D and K.

   Node D and node K receive the packet from node F, repeat the steps,
   decapsulate the packet and forward it out the BIER domain.
