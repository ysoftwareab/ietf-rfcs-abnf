1. Introduction 

   The term "Voice over IP Peering" (VoIP Peering) has   historically 
   been used to describe a wide variety of aspects pertaining to the 
   interconnection of service provider networks and to the delivery of 
   Session Initial Protocol (SIP [2]) call termination over those 
   interconnections. 

   The discussion of these interconnections has at times been confused 
   by the fact that the term "peering" is used in various contexts to 
   relate to interconnection at different levels in a protocol stack. 
   Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect focuses on how to 
   identify and route real-time sessions (such as VoIP calls) at the 
   application layer, and it does not (necessarily) involve the exchange 
   of packet routing data or media sessions. In particular, "layer 5 
   network" is used here to refer to the interconnection between SIP 
   servers, as opposed to interconnection at the IP layer ("layer 3").  
   Finally, the terms "peering" and "interconnect" are used 
   interchangeably throughout this document. 

   This document introduces standard terminology for use in 
   characterizing real-time session interconnection. Note however, that 
   while this document is primarily targeted at the VoIP interconnect 
   case, the terminology described here is applicable to those cases in 

 
 
Meyer                 Expires December 22, 2007                [Page 2] 
Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology               June 2007 
 
 
   which service providers interconnect using SIP signaling for non-
   voice or quasi-real-time communications. 

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2 
   provides the general context for the SPEERMINT Working Group. Section 
   3 provides the general definitions for real-time SIP based 
   communication, with initial focus on the VoIP interconnect case, and 
   Section 4 defines the terminology describing the various forms of 
   peering. Finally, Section 5 introduces the concept of federations. 

2.  SPEERMINT Context 

   Figure 1 depicts the general session interconnect context. Note that 
   vertical axis in this figure describes the layering of identifiers, 
   while the horizontal lines indicate working group scope. While the 
   SPEERMINT working group is not limited (or coupled in any way) to the 
   use of E.164 numbers, in the case shown here an E.164 number [5] is 
   used as a key in an E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
   mapping (ENUM [4]). That URI is in turn used to retrieve a NAPTR 
   record [3], which is in turn resolved into a SIP URI.  Call routing 
   is based on the resulting SIP URI. Note that the call routing step 
   does not depend on the presence of an E.164 number. Indeed, the 
   resulting SIP URI may no longer even contain any numbers of any type. 
   In particular, the SIP URI can be advertised in various other ways, 
   such as on a web page.

                  Figure 1: Session Interconnect Context 

   Note that in Figure 1, Session Establishment Data (SED), is the data 
   used to route a call to the called domain's ingress point (see 
   Section 3.3 for additional detail). 

   As illustrated in Figure 1, the ENUM Working Group is primarily 
   concerned with the acquisition of SED while the SPEERMINT Working 
   Group is focused on the use of such SED in routing session signaling 
   requests. Importantly, the SED can be derived from ENUM (i.e., an 
   E.164 DNS entry) or via any other mechanism available to theuser. 
   Finally, note that the term "call" is being used here in the most 
   general sense, i.e., call routing and session routing are used 
   interchangeably. 

3. General Definitions 

3.1. Signaling Path Border Element 

   A signaling path border element (SBE) provides signaling functions 
   such as protocol inter-working (for example, H.323 to SIP), identity 
   and topology hiding, and Call Admission Control (CAC) for a domain. 
   Such an SBE is frequently (but need not be) deployed on a domain's 
   border. 

3.2. Data Path Border Element 

   A data path border element (DBE) provides media-related functions 
   such as deep packet inspection and modification, media relay, and 
   firewall support under SBE control. As was the case with the SBE, a 
   DBE is frequently deployed on a domain's border. 

3.3. Session Establishment Data 

   Session Establishment Data, or SED, is the data used to route a call 
   to the called domain's ingress point. A domain's ingress point can be 
   thought of as the location pointed to by the SRV record [1] that 
   resulted from the resolution of the SED (i.e., a SIP URI). 

   More specifically, the SED is the set of parameters that the outgoing 
   SBEs need to complete the call, and may include:

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology               June 2007 
 
 
     . A destination SIP URI 

     . A SIP proxy to send the INVITE to, including 

          o  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) 

          o  Port 

          o  Transport Protocol (UDP/TCP/TLS) 

     . Security Parameters, including 

          o  TLS certificate to use 

          o  TLS certificate to expect 

          o  TLS certificate verification setting 

     . Optional resource control parameters such as 

          o  Limits on the total number of calls to a peer 

          o  Limits on SIP transactions/second 

          o  Limits on the total amount of bandwidth used on a peering 
             link 

          o  In addition, lower layer parameters (such as DSCP markings 
             on SIP and/or media packets [8]) might also be included. 

3.4. Call Routing 

   Call routing is the set of processes, rules, and SED used to route a 
   call to its proper (SIP) destination.  More generally, call routing 
   can be thought of as the set of processes, rules and SED which are 
   used to route a real-time session to its termination point. 

3.5. PSTN 

   The term "PSTN" refers to the Public Switched Telephone Network. In 
   particular, the PSTN refers to the collection of interconnected 
   circuit-switched voice-oriented public telephone networks, both 
   commercial and government-owned.  In general, PSTN terminals are 
   addressed using E.164 numbers; various dial-plans (such as emergency 
   services dial-plans), however, may not directly use E.164 numbers.

3.6. IP Path 

   For purposes of this document, an IP path is defined to be a sequence 
   of zero or more IP router hops. 

3.7. Peer Network 

   This document defines a peer network as the set of SIP UASs and SIP 
   UACs (customers) that are controlled by a single administrative 
   domain and can be reached via some IP path. Note that such a peer 
   network may also contain end-users who are located on the PSTN (and 
   hence may also be interconnected with the PSTN), as long as they are 
   also reachable via some IP path. 

3.8. Service Provider 

   A Service Provider (or SP) is defined to be an entity that provides 
   layer 3 (IP) transport of SIP signaling and media packets. 

3.9. SIP Service Provider 

   A SIP Service Provider (or SSP) is an entity that provides transport 
   of SIP signaling to its customers. In the event that the SSP is also 
   an SP, it may also provide media streams to its customers.  Such a 
   service provider may additionally be interconnected with other 
   service providers; that is, it may "peer" with other service 
   providers. A SSP may also interconnect with the PSTN. 

3.10. Internet Telephony Service Provider 

   An Internet Telephony Service Provider, or ITSP, is a synonym for 
   SSP. While the terms ITSP and SSP are frequently used 
   interchangeably, the SPEERMINT working group uses the term SSP. 

4. Peering 

   While the precise definition of the term "peering" is the subject of 
   considerable debate, peering in general refers to the negotiation of 
   reciprocal interconnection arrangements, settlement-free or 
   otherwise, between operationally independent service providers. 

   This document distinguishes two types of peering, Layer 3 Peering and 
   Layer 5 peering, which are described below. 

4.1. Layer 3 Peering 

   Layer 3 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers' 
   networks for the purposes of exchanging IP packets which destined for 
   one (or both) of the peer's networks. Layer 3 peering is generally 
 
 
Meyer                 Expires December 22, 2007                [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology               June 2007 
 
 
   agnostic to the IP payload, and is frequently achieved using a 
   routing protocol such as BGP [6] to exchange the required routing 
   information. 

   An alternate, perhaps more operational definition of layer 3 peering 
   is that two peers exchange only customer routes, and hence any 
   traffic between peers terminates on one of the peer's network. 

4.2. Layer 5 Peering 

   Layer 5 (Session) peering refers to interconnection of two service 
   providers for the purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real time) 
   secure call signaling between their respective customers using SIP 
   methods.  Such interconnection may be direct or indirect (see Section 
   4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2 below). Note that media streams associated 
   with this signaling (if any) are not constrained to follow the same 
   set of IP paths. 

4.2.1. Direct Peering 

   Direct peering describes those cases in which two service providers 
   interconnect without using an intervening layer 5 network. 

4.2.2. Indirect Peering 

   Indirect, or transit, peering refers to the establishment of a secure 
   signaling path via one (or more) referral or transit network(s). In 
   this case it is generally required that a trust relationship is 
   established between the originating service provider and the transit 
   network on one side, and the transit network and the termination 
   network on the other side. 

4.2.3. Assisted Peering 

   In this case, some entity (usually a federation, see Section 5) 
   employs a central SIP proxy (which is not itself a SSP) to bridge 
   calls between participating networks.  

4.2.4. On-demand Peering 

   Service providers are said to peer on-demand when they are able to 
   exchange traffic without any pre-association prior to the origination 
   of a real-time transaction (like a SIP message) between the domains. 
   Any information that needs to be exchanged between domains in support 
   of peering can be learned through a dynamic protocol mechanism.

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology               June 2007 
 
 
4.2.5. Static Peering 

   Service providers are said to peer statically when pre-association 
   between providers is required for the initiation of any real-time 
   transactions (like a SIP message). 

5. Federations 

   A federation is a group of SSPs which agree to receive calls from 
   each other via SIP, and who agree on a set of administrative rules 
   for such calls (settlement, abuse-handling, ...) and the specific 
   rules for the technical details of the interconnection. 

   A federation may provide some or all of the following functionality: 

     . Common static policies 

          o  Routing 

          o  Domain 

          o  Location 

          o  Next hop 

          o  Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) 

     . Common dynamic policies 

          o  Congestion control 

          o  CODEC preference 

          o  Authentication preference 

          o  Quality monitoring capabilities (e.g. RTCP, RTCP-XR) 

     . Policy management (enforcement) 

          o  Ad-hoc 

          o  Published in the DNS, or 

          o  Policy might also be managed by a federation entity 

     . A federated ENUM root 

     . Address resolution mechanisms

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology               June 2007 
 
 
     . Session signaling (via federation policy) 

     . Media streams (via federation policy) 

     . Federation security policies 

     . Interconnection policies 

     . Other layer 2 and layer 3 policies 

     . Security parameters 

     . Optional resource control parameters 

     Finally, note that a SIP can be a member of 

          o  No federation (e.g., the SP has only bilateral peering 
             agreements) 

          o  A single federation 

          o  Multiple federations 

     and an SP can have any combination of bi-lateral and multi-lateral 
     (i.e., federated) interconnections. 

6. Acknowledgments 

   Many of the definitions were gleaned from detailed discussions on the 
   SPEERMINT, ENUM, and SIPPING mailing lists. Scott Brim, Mike Hammer, 
   Eli Katz,  Gaurav Kulshreshtha, Otmar Lendl, Jason Livingood, 
   Alexander Mayrhofer, Jean-Francois Mule, Jonathan Rosenberg, David 
   Schwartz, Richard Shockey, Henry Sinnreich, Richard Stastny, Hannes 
   Tschofenig, Dan Wing, and Adam Uzelac all made valuable contributions 
   to early versions of this document. Patrik Faltstrom also made many 
   insightful comments to early versions of this draft, and contributed 
   the basis of Figure 1. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations. However, it 
   is important to note that session interconnect, as described in this 
   document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be 
   considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case 
   analyzes. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces [7].
