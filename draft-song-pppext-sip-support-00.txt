Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  
   PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) for 
   establishing, configuring, and testing the data-link connection; and
   a family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and 
   configuring different network-layer protocols.

   This document defines the PPP IPCP configuration option that contains
   a list of IPv4 addresses of SIP proxy servers. It is just one of the 
   many possible mechanism to locate the SIP proxy server, such as DHCP 
   option [6] and manual configuration. This approach is applicable to
   the system using PPP for the link layer protocol and IP address 
   allocation (ex. 3GPP2 Packet Data network)

1. Introduction

   The SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)[3] is a signaling protocol
   used for the session invitation, modification and termination. 
   The UAC(User Agent Client) sends a request to the UAS(User Agent
   Server).  However, the request message (INVITE) is not directly sent
   to the callee UAS, it rather go through proxy servers, and possibly 
   redirect servers.  This draft is specifying one of the many possible
   mechanism to locate the SIP proxy server, such as DHCP option[6] and
   manual configuration.  

   This draft extends the NCP for establishing and configuring the
   Internet Protocol over PPP [4], by specifying a IPCP option that
   allows SIP clients to locate a list of SIP proxy servers that is to
   be used for all SIP requests. This approach is applicable to the 
   system utilizing PPP for the link layer protocol and IP address 
   allocation (ex. 3GPP2 Packet Data network)
 
   Note : the format and behavior of these options are quoted from 
   RFC1877 [2] for the sake of consistent implementation of PPP. 

2.  Configuration Options

   The Configuration Option format and basic options are defined by 
   IPCP configuration option [4].

   The most updated value of the IPCP Option Type field are specified in 
   the IANA web site [IANA-ALLOCATION].  This document concerns the 
   following values:

   [?] Primary SIP Server Address 
   [?+1] Secondary SIP Server Address

2.1.  Primary SIP server Address Option

   Description

      This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with
      the remote peer the address of the primary SIP server Address 
      to be used on the local end of the link.  

      By default, no primary SIP server address is provided.

   A summary of the Primary SIP Address Configuration Option format is
   shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Primary-SIP-Address

      The four octet Primary-SIP-Server Address is the address of the
      primary proxy SIP server to be used by the local peer.  
      If all four octets are set to zero, it indicates an explicit 
      request that the peer provide the address information in a 
      Config-Nak packet.

   Default

      No address is provided.
   

1.3.  Secondary SIP Server Address

   Description

      This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with
      the remote peer the address of the secondary SIP server Address 
      to be used on the local end of the link.  

      By default, no secondary SIP address is provided.

   Secondary-SIP-Address

      The four octet Secondary-SIP-Server Address is the address of the
      secondary SIP server to be used by the local peer.  If all four 
      octets are set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the 
      peer provide the address information in a Config-Nak packet.

   Default

      No address is provided.
