Internet-Draft Signaling and data separation of PMIPv6 October 2009




Abstract

   The mobility management signaling of PMIPv6 includes PBU/PBA message.
   Both messages use the IPv6 mobility header, which is an expansion of
   IPv6 header, to carry signaling information. The transport protocol
   has not been used, which can not guarantee the reliability of
   transmission. This draft proposes to extend PMIP to make it has
   transport protocol support and negotiation mechanism. The advantage
   of this extension is that transport protocol can provide more
   reliable transportation especially in the scenario that MAG and LMA
   are connected by a congested IP network.

Internet-Draft Signaling and data separation of PMIPv6 October 2009


1. Introduction

   RFC5213 specifies proxy mobile IPv6 which is different from MIPv6 in
   many aspects but the signaling of PMIPv6 and MIPv6 has much
   similarity. The mobility management signaling of PMIPv6 is mainly
   PBU/PBA message. Both of them use IPv6 mobility header to carry
   signaling information and do not use any transport layer protocol.
   This design approach is inherited from MIPv6. MIPv6 use mobility
   header enables IPv6 supporting mobility inherent, since MIPv6
   requires the MN which has IPv6 protocol stack involved in mobility
   management. Further more, IPv6 extension header facilitates MIPv6's
   routing optimization.

   For PMIP, there is not much benefit from using mobility header except
   that the signaling format has much similarity with MIPv6 and then
   enable the LMA could reuse the functionality of HA. Since PMIPv6 does
   not use and transport layer protocol for signaling, there is no
   guarantee for the signaling message would be transferred successfully.
   The lost of mobility signaling message will lead to poor user
   experience during handover or even break the functionality of PMIPv6.

   This document proposes a new extension to PMIPv6 to make it support
   transport layer protocol negotiation. Using this extension, operators
   that deploy PMIPv6 in large scale and un-trusted network scenario
   will guarantee the transportation of mobility signaling and thence
   improve the user experience during handover.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3. Motivation of signaling and data separation for PMIP

   3.1 Scenario

   The following figure describe that the scenarios that PMIPv6 may need
   transport layer protocol for mobility signaling message. As
   illustrated in figure 1, the LMA and MAG may be deployed by one
   operator but the transport network between them may belong to another
   operator. The operator that deploys the LMA and MAG have no control
   of the transportation network so it can not optimize the transport
   network to enable it provide better availability. For example, if the
   PBU message lost during the transmission, the MAG would resend again,
   but if the PBA message lost, the MAG will have no way to know whether
   the PBA is lost during transmission or LMA have not finishing the

   processing of the PBU message. This will cause problems during
   handover. In this scenario, it is necessary to use transport protocol
   to guarantee the availability of the transmission of mobility
   signaling.

          Figure 1 scenario for using transport protocol for PMIP

   3.2 Experimental result of PMIP signaling transportation

   We have setup and PMIP demo to test the PMIP signaling transportation
   issue when LMA and MAG are connected through large scale network. The
   detail result will be included in the updated version of this
   document.

4. Extensions of PBU/PBA

   The extension of PBU/PBA is shown in Figure 2. It is an optional
   extension. The purpose of this extension is used for the MAG and LMA
   to negotiate whether they support the transport protocol and decide
   which transport protocol to use.

             Figure 2: Transport protocol negotiation option
   The above option could be added in the mobility options section of
   PBU and PBA. The definition of its various fields is as follows:

Internet-Draft Signaling and data separation of PMIPv6 October 2009


   Type: the type of option, specific value to be determined.
   Length: option length (number of bytes, excluding type and length
   field).
   Transport protocol Type: transport protocol type. Its value is as
   follows:
   001: SCTP Protocol.
   002: TCP Protocol.
   Others: To be determined.

   Status: Its value as follows:
   000: Negotiation successfully.
   001: Using the transport protocol negotiations failed. The reason is:
   LMA does not support this feature or do not want to use it.
   002: Negotiation failed. The reason is: PBU issued by MAG with this
   option in the wrong format.
   003: Termination the use of transport protocol failed. The reason is:
   the LMA could not be terminated the use of transport protocol
   temporarily.
   Others: To be determined.

   Flag:
   T: If this flag is set to 1, it means that MAG initiates the
   negotiation of transport protocol.

   E: If this flag is set to 1, it means that MAG wants to terminate the
   using of transport protocol for transmit mobility signaling.

   A: If this flag is set to 1, it means LMA agreed to the negotiation
   request by MAG.

   R: If this flag is set to 1, it means MAG refused the request of the
   negotiation. The specific reason is given by the status code.

   Reserved: reservation, and can be used for other expansion.


5. Negotiation Mechanism

   When MAG wants to use transport protocol, it can send PBU to the LMA
   with the transport protocol option which contains the transport
   protocols it support and T field set to 1. When LMA receives PBU with
   this option, if it agrees to use transport protocol for transmission,
   it should select one transport protocol that listed by the PBU and

Internet-Draft Signaling and data separation of PMIPv6 October 2009


   send PBA with transport protocol options and A filed set to 1. The
   selected transport protocol is indicated by the Transport protocol
   Type filed.
   After the successful negotiation, the follow-up transport between the
   PBU/PBA Message will use the transport protocol to provide
   reliability. The signaling message will be put into the payload
   section of the transport protocol.

   LMA MAY send PBA with R filed set to 1 to reject the negotiation
   request in error conditions. The MAG will then use the IPv6 mobility
   header for signaling.
   MAG can also send PBU with transport protocol negotiation options to
   stop the use of transport protocol. When MAG wants to stop the use of
   transport protocol, it MAY send PBU with E set to 1 to the LMA. LMA
   received this PBU with this option. If LMA agrees to end the using of
   transport protocol, LMA MAY send PBA with A set to 1. After that,
   follow-up transport of signaling between MAG and LMA will no longer
   use transport protocol. LMA MAY send PBA Message with R set to 1 to
   reject this request in some conditions.

6. Mobility Agent Considerations

   The following sections describe the behavior of the mobility agent in
   detail.

6.1. Mobility Access Gateway Considerations

   The MAG SHOULD send PBU with this extend option of the transport
   protocol in accordance with the deployment scenario and management
   strategy. The MAG should turn on/off this feature by configuration
   files or FLAG.

6.2. Local Mobile Anchor Considerations

   The LMA SHOULD send PBA with this extend Options of the transport
   protocol in accordance with the deployment scenario and management
   strategy to accept or reject MAG's request.

6.3. Compatibility

   During the deployment, there may be a scenario that the MAG/LMA
   supports this feature but the peering MAG/LMA does not support. This
   scenario may happen during handover between different domains. In

   this condition, the unsupported entity should discard this option and
   the entity that support this option should stop trying after time out.

7. Security Considerations

   TBD

8. IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to allocate the application protocol
   number for TCP/SCTP to indicate the payload is PMIPv6 mobility
   signaling.
