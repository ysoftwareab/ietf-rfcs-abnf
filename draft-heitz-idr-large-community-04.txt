1.  Introduction

   A Large Community attribute is defined that encodes 12 bytes
   communities, suitable for 4-Octet Autonomous System Numbers that
   require 8 octets of locally significant opaque data.

   The Large Community is specifically designed to accomodate routing
   policy related to 4-byte ASNs, as it allows operators to specify two
   4-byte ASNs and still have room for 4 bytes for an action.  For
   example, to make a request to AS65551 to add 3 prepends when sending
   a route to AS65536, one might add the Large Community
   65551:303:65536.  AS65551 would publish a list of large communities
   and their associated actions.  The Large Community is opaque.

   To ensure rapid and smooth adoption of the new community attribute,
   it must be as similar to the [RFC1997] community as possible, only
   bigger.

2.  Large BGP Community Attribute

   The Large Community Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute,
   with the Type Code (suggested 41) to be assigned by IANA.  The
   attribute consists of a set of Large Communities.  All routes with
   the Large Community attribute belong to the communities listed in the
   attribute.

   Each Large Community is encoded as a 12-octet quantity, as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Autonomous System number                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Local Data Part 1                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Local Data Part 2                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Autonomous System Number:  This field indicates the Autonomous System
      in which the Large Community has a meaning.

   Local Data part 1:  data set by network operator

   Local Data part 2:  data set by network operator

3.  Textual Representation

   The textual representation of the Large Community is A:B:C, where A
   is the Autonomous System number, B is the Local Data part 1 and C is
   the Local Data part 2.  A ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  B ranges from
   0 to 4294967295.  C ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  A, B and C are
   plain decimal non-negative integers without leading zeroes.  Each
   number must appear, even if it is 0.  For example, "0:1:2" cannot be
   written as ":1:2".  The string is expected to match the following
   regular expression: ^[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+$

4.  Error Handling

   The error handling of Large Community is as follows:

   o  The Large Community attribute SHALL be considered malformed if its
      length is not a non-zero multiple of 12 bytes.

   o  An UPDATE message with a malformed Large Community attribute SHALL
      be handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw" as described
      in section 2 [RFC7606].

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of Large
   BGP Community:

   o  Cisco IOS XR

   o  ExaBGP

   The latest implementation news is tracked at
   http://largebgpcommunities.net/ [1].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a BGP path attribute value for the Large
   Community attribute (suggested 41).

8.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Ruediger Volk, Russ White, Acee Lindem, Shyam Sethuram,
   Jared Mauch, Joel M.  Halpern and Nick Hilliard for insightful review
   and comments.
