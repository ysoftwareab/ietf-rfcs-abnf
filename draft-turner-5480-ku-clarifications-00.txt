1.  Introduction

   [RFC5480] specifies the syntax and semantics for the Subject Public
   Key Information field in certificates that support Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography.  As part of these semantics, it defines what
   combinations are permissible for the values of the key usage
   extensions [RFC5280].  [RFC5480] specifies 7 of the 9 values; it
   makes no mention of keyEncipherment and dataEncipherment key usage
   bits.  This document corrects this omission, but updating Section 3
   of [RFC5480] to include semantics for these two key usages.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updates to Section 3

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   id-ecPublicKey as algorithm of AlgorithmIdentifier [RFC2986] in
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then following values MUST NOT be present:

     keyEncipherment; and
     dataEncipherment.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   id-ecDH or id-ecMQV in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following
   values also MUST NOT be present:

     keyEncipherment; and
     dataEncipherment.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   found in [RFC5480].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
