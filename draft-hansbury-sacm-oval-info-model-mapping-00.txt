                  OVAL and the SACM Information Model
             draft-hansbury-sacm-oval-info-model-mapping-00

Abstract

   The OVAL community has spent more than ten years developing and
   employing the OVAL Language.  During this time, the community has
   made a number of design decisions and learned a number of lessons
   that should be leveraged as next generation endpoint posture
   assessment is formulated.  There are a number of places throughout
   the SACM Information Model document that could be fulfilled by
   portions of the OVAL Language, either in its current state or, in
   some cases, with modifications.  Another output of the work executed
   under the OVAL project is a number of lessons that are applicable to
   the SACM work.  These lessons include a clear separation of data
   collection and evaluation; a call to focus on ensuring both primary
   source vendors and third party security experts feel invited to the
   discussion and are empowered to leverage their unique domain
   knowledge; and to strive for simplicity and flexibility, where
   possible.  Finally, the OVAL community has a set of clear
   recommendations with respect to which parts of OVAL should be used by
   SACM as a means to make best use of the efforts of those that have
   worked on and supported OVAL over the past ten years.  Those
   recommendations are:

   o  Use the OVAL System Characteristics Model as a base data model for
      at least one way to provide data collection.

   o  Use the OVAL Definitions Model in parts as a base data model for
      both evaluation and collection guidance.

   o  Do not use the OVAL Results Model for a data model to encode
      evaluation results.

1.  Introduction

   The Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) IETF Working
   Group [SACM] has been chartered with standardizing the mechanisms by
   which endpoint security assessment is performed.  This includes
   software inventory, compliance and vulnerability management, and
   other related activities.  The Working Group has created a series of
   artifacts [SACM-DOCUMENTS] to capture the important concepts required
   to accomplish this goal.  In addition to Use Cases, Requirements, and
   Architecture documents, the Working Group has created an initial
   draft of an Information Model that describes the high-level
   components and concepts that fulfill the already defined
   requirements.

   This white paper discusses how the Open Vulnerability and Assessment
   Language (OVAL) [OVAL-WEBSITE] can be leveraged in order to implement
   the Information Model defined by the SACM group.  This paper is not
   meant to suggest that the entire OVAL Data Model could-or even
   should-be supported by SACM; rather, it breaks apart the various
   components of the OVAL Language and discusses how each could be used
   to satisfy parts of the Information Model.

   This document assumes that the reader is already familiar with OVAL
   and its structures.  For those readers that require more in-depth
   information about OVAL, please review the OVAL Tutorial documentation
   [OVAL-DEFINITION-TUTORIAL] and other related documentation on the
   OVAL website.  This document describes how these structures can be
   thought of as data models whose scopes and activities overlap with
   the SACM Information Model.

   Additionally, in later sections, the paper presents lessons learned
   from the ten plus years of OVAL development and curation, as well as
   related gaps.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  SACM Information Model

   The information model defined by the SACM Working Group captures the
   types of objects and data required to fulfill the defined SACM
   Requirements [I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements].  It additionally provides
   details on the flow of data to and from the different objects in the

   system, in conjunction with the SACM Architecture document
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-architecture].  The document describes all of these
   things in a protocol and data format neutral manner.

   The document provides descriptions of the various components that are
   required to perform endpoint assessments, along with some usage
   scenarios, and the potential mapping from OVAL to any of these
   defined components wherever OVAL may be relevant.

3.  OVAL Language

   The OVAL Language is made up of several parts, each responsible for
   encapsulating a part of the assessment model.  Each part is discussed
   briefly below [STRUCTURE-OF-OVAL].

   Note: A word about Core vs. Platform Extensions.  OVAL can be broadly
   split into Core structures, which are those that are foundational and
   give the overall structure to the OVAL Language, and the Platform
   Extensions, which are platform-specific structures that extend the
   Core in order to provide ways to encode the underlying low-level,
   platform-specific tests used by OVAL Content.  This paper is chiefly
   focused on mapping the Core into the SACM Information Model.

   In a similar fashion, while thinking about how to implement the SACM
   Information Model, two distinct levels must be considered:

   1.  Platform-agnostic, high level concepts

   2.  Platform-specific concepts

3.1.  Core OVAL Data Models

   There are a number of models defined as part of OVAL.  This section
   discusses the three most important models.

3.1.1.  OVAL Definitions Model

   The Definitions Model is the central component of the OVAL Language.
   The structures in this model allow an author to encode what data to
   collect, the expected values for the data, and the rules by which to
   evaluate that data.  This represents one of the chief limitations of
   the OVAL Language: Since an author must include both what data must
   be collected, and how that data is to be assessed in an OVAL
   Definition, these two related-but separate-elements are directly
   coupled to one another.  For more information, see the related
   "Collection and Evaluation Must Be De-coupled" section below.





Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   It is in the OVAL Definitions Model that the Definition object is
   defined.  A Definition is the root element for any OVAL check.  It
   contains a set of criteria, either simple or complex, to define how
   the check should operate.  In addition, the OVAL Definitions Model
   defines the base structures that are used by the Platform Extensions
   to extend OVAL, as well as Functions, and other high-level concepts.

3.1.2.  OVAL System Characteristics Model

   The OVAL System Characteristics Model defines structures to encode
   the actual data that is collected.  It provides basic structures for
   capturing this data, including the Item, which is the base structure
   for recording collected data in OVAL.  It also provides structures
   for capturing information about the endpoint from which the data was
   collected, including OS information, endpoint identification
   information (such as IP and MAC addresses), and other relevant
   endpoint metadata.

3.1.3.  OVAL Results Model

   Finally, OVAL provides a third model to encode the results of the
   assessment: the OVAL Results Model.  In addition to providing
   structures to capture essential information about the evaluation
   results, such as the overall results of each assessment and when the
   assessment occurred, the model also provides ways to include both the
   guidance (Definitions) and collected data (System Characteristics)
   used for the assessments.  This model provides a comprehensive way to
   capture not only the results themselves, but also the information
   used to determine the result.

3.2.  Additional Core OVAL Data Models

   Additional data models are defined that support specific capabilities
   and are sometimes useful in conjunction with the OVAL models
   previously discussed.  The models discussed in this section are not
   intended to stand alone, and require the use of one or more of the
   core OVAL models.

3.2.1.  OVAL Common Model

   The Common Model is a very simple collection of global building
   blocks, such as enumerations used throughout the other models, along
   with some other foundational pieces.  Common values are defined in
   this model once and then applied within other OVAL models, thus
   reducing redundancy between each OVAL data model.  Examples of the
   elements provided by the OVAL Common Model are enumerations that
   provide useful value sets for use within OVAL, such as family types
   ("windows", "unix", etc.), data types (e.g., "string," "boolean,"

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   "int," etc.), and class types (e.g., "vulnerability," "compliance,"
   etc.).

3.2.2.  OVAL Variables Model

   The OVAL Variables Model provides a simple framework for externally
   specifying variable values to an OVAL Definitions document at
   runtime.

3.2.3.  OVAL Directives Model

   The OVAL Directives Model provides a very simple model with
   structures to indicate the level of detail that should be present in
   an OVAL Results document.

4.  Relating the OVAL Models to the SACM Information Model

   The following section discusses each piece of the SACM Information
   Model, where one or more OVAL models can be used to implement the
   piece, wholly or in part.

4.1.  Attribute Collector

   The SACM Information Model defines both Internal and External
   Attribute Collectors.  Both are components that perform the
   collection of posture information about an endpoint.  The Information
   Model lists a number of examples of Collectors such as Network
   Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), NEA posture collectors, and
   vulnerability scanners.  While OVAL is not directly applicable for
   some types of Attribute Collectors such as NIDS, it is certainly
   applicable for items such as configuration or vulnerability scanners.

   An Attribute Collector needs to be instructed as to what specific
   posture attributes must be collected, when or how often those
   attributes must be collected, and how to share the collected
   attributes.  In some cases, an Attribute Collector may simply collect
   data and directly respond to the caller with the required results.
   In others, it may need to execute the data collection at a future
   time or at some interval, and thus will need to know how to share the
   collected data.  The OVAL Language does not provide any mechanism for
   instructing tools where to send collected data, but the OVAL
   Definitions Model can (among other things) encode what data must be
   collected; however, it does not allow (as currently constructed) for
   providing any notion of what constitutes valid data collection (i.e.,
   how recent data must be to be considered acceptable, and how and
   where it was collected).





Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   Additionally, the OVAL Definitions Model could be modified to support
   monitoring of events.  As it is today, OVAL doesn't have any explicit
   way to include this instruction, but it would be simple to modify the
   model to include this notion.

   The OVAL System Characteristics Model allows the encoding of
   collected information and can be used to implement a data format for
   sharing collected data.  While OVAL does not require that tools store
   data using a standardized format (though they are free to do so), a
   standardized format is required to allow tools to share data.  The
   OVAL System Characteristics Model provides a standardized way to
   encode this information.

4.2.  Evaluator

   An Evaluator is the component that analyzes inputs such as Posture
   Attributes and Evaluation Guidance to determine the result of a
   particular assessment.  It is the piece that answers a question about
   the security posture of one more endpoints.  The Evaluator must be
   able to ingest inputs of various types, understand the question or
   questions asked of it, and analyze the inputs to make a
   determination.

   In this case, OVAL could be used to provide several of the required
   inputs to an Evaluator.  The format defined in the OVAL Definitions
   Model could be used to express Evaluation Guidance.  Note that when
   mapping the OVAL Definitions Data Model to the SACM Information
   Model, it is important to distinguish between Collection and
   Evaluation within the OVAL Definitions Model.  The OVAL Definitions
   Model structures currently combine both the Collection ("what to
   collect") and Evaluation ("what the data should look like").  One of
   the key concepts within the SACM Information Model is that Collection
   and Evaluation should be separate concepts.  Nonetheless, OVAL
   contains building blocks that could be modified to satisfy this need.

   Additionally, the structures defined in the OVAL System
   Characteristics Model could be used to encode the Posture Attributes
   input to the Evaluator.  Finally, when the Evaluator makes its
   determination and must encode the result of the assessment, the OVAL
   Results Model structures could be used as well.

4.3.  Endpoint Attribute Assertion

   According to the SACM Information Model, an Endpoint Attribute
   Assertion is a way to indicate that a specified set of posture
   attributes or events were present on an endpoint during a specific
   interval of time.  For example, an Assertion could be made that a




Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   particular Windows server had the following attributes from 1/1/2015
   - 1/8/2015:

   o  os = Windows 7

   o  mac-address = 01:24:42:58:34:2b

   OVAL does not have a direct corollary to this construct; however, the
   structures defined by the OVAL System Characteristics Model could
   provide a base from which such a construct could be built.  The
   System Characteristics Data Model is designed to capture posture
   attributes, and as such, could be extended or modified to include the
   concept of a time interval.

   Additionally, it is important to note that the SACM Information Model
   also states that Events can be included within an Endpoint Attribute
   Assertion.  While "event" and "attribute" are often used
   interchangeably, in the SACM Information Model, these two concepts
   are considered distinct.  The distinction is that an "event" is
   something that has a value that does not change until something
   causes a change, whereas an "attribute" is something that occurs at a
   moment in time.  The Endpoint Attribute Assertion deals with both
   posture attributes and events during a time interval.  No special
   treatment is given to Events within OVAL as it is currently
   constructed, although, as stated previously, adding a time interval
   to support Events is simple to do.

4.4.  Evaluation Result

   An Evaluation Result is the representation of the analysis of a given
   set of Posture Attributes against Evaluation Guidance.  The OVAL
   Results Model structures can be used to encode one or more Evaluation
   Results.

4.5.  Collection Guidance

   Within the SACM Information Model, Collection Guidance is defined as
   information that describes which Posture Attributes must be collected
   from one or more endpoints.  It is the means by which an Attribute
   Collector determines what information it must collect, as well as
   when that information must be collected (including intervals for
   repeated collection activities).

   The OVAL Definitions Model provides structures capable of expressing
   information about what data must be collected for an assessment.  It
   is important to note that the method by which the OVAL Definitions
   Model accomplishes this will not necessarily directly apply to the
   SACM Information Model in its current state.  In many cases, which



Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   specific posture attributes should be collected is not distinct from
   its evaluation guidance.  For the OVAL Definitions Model to be used
   to implement the SACM Information Model, work would need to be
   undertaken to de-couple these concepts.

   While the model provides the ability to encode details such as what
   data must be collected from the endpoint, it does not currently
   provide the ability to include information such as collection
   interval.  The model can be extended, however, to add this
   capability.  Adding the concept of an "interval" to the model to
   capture the concept may be a way to accomplish this goal.

   Important Note: One of the key drawbacks to OVAL is that Platform
   Extensions (using the OVAL Definitions Model as a base) must be
   created for each platform and data source to capture any Posture
   Attributes that must be collected for a given platform and data
   source.  As a result, it is not easy or scalable to create or update
   extensions for rapidly changing platforms and products in a timely
   manner.

   With this in mind, it is important that any use of the OVAL
   Definitions Model to satisfy Collection Guidance for SACM should
   warrant consideration of updates that change this from a solution
   where the low-level platform details are part of the language itself,
   to one where the format provides a way for domain experts (ideally
   primary source vendors) to instruct tools what Posture Attributes to
   collect.

   This also applies to the next section (Evaluation Guidance).

4.6.  Evaluation Guidance

   The Evaluation Guidance component contains the information that
   directs an Evaluator how to perform one or more assessments based on
   collected data.  Evaluation Guidance must direct the Evaluator on
   what the expected state of collected data should be.  Additionally,
   it must be able to specify desired characteristics of the data.  That
   is, it must be able to not only cite the specific posture attributes
   under evaluation, but also to specify characteristics such as the
   type of tool that was used to collect the data, how old the data is,
   etc.

   The Evaluator must then ingest this guidance, locate the required
   data-whether locally or remotely available-and then execute the
   analysis required.

   OVAL offers the OVAL Definitions Model to provide the structures for
   encoding the expected state or values for the collected data.  The

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   OVAL Language does not currently provide a way to specify the
   expected characteristics of the data, but the OVAL Definitions Model
   could be augmented to include this type of information.
   Alternatively, the concept could be added elsewhere and re-used as
   appropriate.  Allowing for characteristics information will be
   important to allow evaluation to do things like only query data if
   it's been collected within the past x days or only query data that is
   collected by a credentialed scan.

   Again, as Collection and Evaluation are intertwined currently in OVAL
   Language, some work will be required to de-couple them for use with
   the Evaluation Guidance component.

4.7.  Report Generator

   Within the SACM Information Model, a Report Generator is a component
   that constructs a collection of artifacts such as Endpoint Attribute
   Assertions, Evaluation Results, etc.  The reports that are generated
   by this component can be used to either report on a collection of
   assessments, or to provide a summary of previously run assessments or
   queries.

   The structures defined in the OVAL Results Model could be used by the
   Report Generator as a means to encode the required report
   information.  The OVAL Results structures can be used to encode
   Evaluation Results, although it would need to be extended to include
   Endpoint Attribute Assertions; as such, a construct does not exist
   within OVAL today.

4.8.  Report

   A Report is the tangible output from the Report Generator.  It
   contains formatted information that satisfies one or more assessments
   or queries.  A data format that implements the Report component must
   be able to support Evaluation Results, Endpoint Attribute Assertions,
   Events, and other related reporting data.

   As mentioned in the Report Generator section, the OVAL Results Model
   structures can be used to encode some of these details today, and can
   be extended to handle Events and Endpoint Attribute Assertions.  It
   is important to note that while OVAL provides this capability,
   historically, the OVAL Results Model structures have been considered
   by many to be too verbose to be used in a large scale enterprise
   environment.  These structures could be revised to allow more
   granular and flexible ways to encode this information in order to
   satisfy the needs of SACM, or a different data model could be used to
   implement this capability.




Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


4.9.  Provenance

   Within the SACM Information Model, Provenance is defined as a
   metadata item that contains information such as the time when an
   artifact is produced, what produced it, the policies that govern it,
   and the method used to produce it.

   Within the OVAL Common Model, a Generator structure is defined to
   express both what created the content, and when it was created.
   While the purpose of this structure does not meet all the needs for
   Provenance in SACM, it could be used as a building block to achieve
   this goal.  This structure would need to be extended to include the
   policy information and the method used to produce a given artifact,
   but the base structure is in place.

5.  SACM Constructs with No OVAL Mapping

   Finally, while there are many similarities between what is defined by
   the SACM Information Model and that supported by OVAL models, there
   are some things discussed in the SACM Information Model document that
   are either different from-or not supported within-OVAL.

5.1.  Tasking

   The SACM Information Model discusses Tasks in a few places, including
   the Collector, Evaluator, and Reporting sections.  Tasks represent of
   notion of "do something at this time."  OVAL does not support any
   notion of a tasking model as currently defined.

   While the OVAL Definitions Model (or some derivative) could be
   referenced by a model that captures tasking, it may be difficult to
   support all of the needs of tasking in this way.  Tasking may already
   be well defined by another, existing model, and if so, it might be
   best to leverage that existing work.

5.2.  Event-driven Actions

   Within the SACM Information Model, in addition to posture attributes,
   events are also often part of the data collection activities.  Events
   are discussed as both part of an Endpoint Attribute Assertion, and an
   Endpoint Attribute Collector.  In each case, it is clear that, in
   addition to the collection of posture attribute data, event data must
   also be taken into account.

   The OVAL Language does not have any notion of capturing events
   directly.  It is constructed to allow the representation of Posture
   Attribute data within the OVAL System Characteristics Model, but
   event data is absent from that model.  OVAL can be modified to



Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   support Events in large part by simply extending it to include a time
   interval.

5.3.  User and Authorization

   The Information Model talks about Users (i.e., one or more end users
   or roles) and Authorizations (i.e., their authority to undertake
   actions).  While OVAL includes some entities that may relate to these
   types of concepts, they appear in very specific low-level tests like
   Windows and UNIX user-related tests.  OVAL lacks any general concept
   of Users or Authorizations that could be applied across its core data
   structures.  The recommendation is to integrate an external solution
   into relevant OVAL models to achieve required capabilities in this
   area.

5.4.  Location

   Similar to Users and Authorization, Locations are defined in the
   Information Model.  Locations include authentication points, wall-
   jacks to which an endpoint is connected, geographical location, etc.

   Again, as for Users and Authorization, the recommendation is for the
   relevant OVAL models to be integrated with other solutions to meet
   these requirements.

6.  Lessons Learned and Gaps

   Over the course of ten-plus years in moderating the OVAL project,
   those involved in the project have released over 15 distinct versions
   of the Language, 25 versions of the OVAL Interpreter, and have
   processed over 25,000 OVAL Definitions in the OVAL Repository.  In
   addition, the team has spent a lot of time interacting with security
   tool vendors, researchers, primary source vendors, and commercial and
   government end users, discussing their needs and struggles.  As such,
   the following lessons learned are presented to help ensure that the
   collective experience of the group is shared with the larger
   community.

   In addition to a description of the lesson, each also has a suggested
   application for the SACM work.

6.1.  Simplicity is Key

6.1.1.  Lesson

   Endpoint assessment covers a broad set of activities.  From
   organization to organization, assessment has different meanings, and
   what is "good enough" for one group, barely scratches the surface for



Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   another.  Experience suggested that caution must be used to avoid
   unnecessary complexity as a means to address this diversity.

   The team has seen that when information sharing is required across
   diverse parties, the simpler the exchange mechanism design, the more
   successful the sharing effort will be.

6.1.2.  SACM Implications

   Review both the diversity of the different organizations that are
   sharing information within the SACM framework, and the types and
   volume of information that must be shared.  Include only the
   information that is required to successfully implement the desired
   Use Cases.

6.2.  Collection and Evaluation Must Be De-coupled

6.2.1.  Lesson

   As OVAL - and the security automation space in general - has evolved,
   it has become clear that the close coupling found in OVAL between the
   OVAL Object and OVAL State (i.e., what to collect and what the
   collected data should look like) is an undesirable feature.  By
   forcing these two concepts into a single model, the Language does not
   easily allow for dynamic querying of previously collected data, nor
   does it easily allow for efficiencies in data collection.

6.2.2.  SACM Implications

   Keep the mechanism by which data is collected and evaluated separate.

6.3.  Keep Separate Core and Extensions

6.3.1.  Lesson

   OVAL, by design, must be frequently updated to keep up with new and
   expanding sets of assessment platforms.  However, tool vendors
   incurred great cost in updating to new versions of the Language,
   including implementing new tests in the updated version, as well as
   general quality testing, updating release and deployment, etc.

   As the project matured, so too did the Core Models that define the
   building blocks for endpoint assessment.  Over the past few years,
   the Core Models rarely changed-in some cases, going years without any
   required update.  The Platform Extension Models, however, will always
   require a frequent revision cycle, and often were out of date very
   quickly.  Despite the fact that these two models had distinct release
   cycle requirements-one continually getting longer in the Core Models,



Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   and one requiring agility in the Platform Extensions-a full release
   of both was required to include changes to any part of the OVAL
   Language.

6.3.2.  SACM Implications

   SACM should focus on providing the foundational building blocks that
   allow those that know best to express what data must be collected to
   assess an endpoint.  The SNMP standard [RFC1157] could be used as a
   model for this type of separation.  SNMP defines the building blocks
   for sharing information about network devices, but defers the low-
   level details of this information sharing to those that best
   understand the products via Management Information Bases (MIBs).
   While this is not a perfectly analogous model for the SACM work, this
   clean separation of core building blocks and protocols from the low-
   level details of products should be emulated, if possible.

6.4.  Empower Subject Matter Experts

6.4.1.  Lesson

   As the security automation field has matured, more primary source
   vendors and other subject matter experts have taken increased
   responsibility in ownership of how their products are assessed.  This
   step in maturity is critical and, within OVAL, as these vendors have
   become more involved, the quality in tests available to tools and end
   users has greatly increased.

6.4.2.  SACM Implications

   Ensure that usage of SACM means that those that best understand the
   component being assessed are empowered to instruct what data must be
   collected for the assessment, along with the meaning of this data.
   As much as possible, keep the mechanism by which this information is
   conveyed as simple as possible to ensure that it is as easy as
   possible for subject matter experts to participate.

6.5.  Carrots Work Better than Sticks

6.5.1.  Lesson

   As much as possible, ensure that usage and compliance with the
   defined standards is encouraged by offering primary source vendors
   and subject matter experts incentive to do so.  Forced compliance
   typically encourages organizations to do the least possible, and does
   not entice them to continually stay engaged.





Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


6.5.2.  SACM Implications

   Find ways to encourage participation that drives long term engagement
   and willing participation.  Engage with vendors to understand their
   problems and, where possible, construct SACM use cases and
   requirements that not only address the needs of the SACM end users,
   but also those of the vendors.  Build a compelling story for use of
   SACM that not only shows value to end users, but shows a clear return
   on investment for vendors.

6.6.  Use Caution Defining Data Collection

6.6.1.  Lesson

   When providing information about what data must be collected as part
   of an assessment, it can be quite easy to provide this information in
   a way that dictates how to collect the required data.  Doing so can
   limit innovation and architectural choices for organizations
   implementing security automation tools.

   On the other hand, it is not always feasible to express what data
   must be collected without implying or instructing specific data
   collection mechanisms.  Over the years, there have been a few cases
   where the OVAL community could not agree on significant issues
   related to data collection.  Discussions on whether to allow open
   scripting in the Language and how best to support both third party
   and primary source contributions were very challenging.  With good
   arguments on both sides of these issues, it was difficult to achieve
   consensus.

6.6.2.  SACM Implications

   This will be one of the bigger challenges for SACM to navigate.  SACM
   must allow those that best understand platforms and products to
   instruct what data must be collected for assessment.  At the same
   time, third party support will be critical in some cases as well, and
   allowances must be made for this.

   Additionally, deciding how many, if any, collection methods are
   allowed as part of the collection instructions will be challenging.
   Again, a balance should be struck to best allow clarity in data
   collection instructions, without limiting innovation and product-
   specific decisions.

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


6.7.  Perspective Matters

6.7.1.  Lesson

   When evaluating collected posture attributes, it is important to be
   able to include additional context to this evaluation in some cases.
   For example, the method by which data was collected could be an
   important piece of information when performing evaluation.  If the
   scanner was a remote, unauthorized scanner of an endpoint, it is
   entirely possible that the scanner could not properly scan for a
   number of posture attributes.  If, however, the scanner ran locally
   on the endpoint as an administrative user, it is much more likely
   that it accurately collected posture attributes from the endpoint.

   Other examples of this type of perspective and context include how
   old the collected data is, and whether the scanner was active or
   passive.

6.7.2.  SACM Implications

   Ensure information that provides necessary context can be provided as
   part of data collection, thereby allowing context-based decisions to
   be made.

6.8.  Flexible Reporting Fidelity is Important

6.8.1.  Lesson

   After data collection and evaluation is complete, the results of the
   evaluation must be shared, often with multiple parties, and in
   multiple ways.  It is important to provide a reasonable amount of
   flexibility with respect to what levels of fidelity are allowed with
   results.  While OVAL did try to achieve a reasonable amount of
   flexibility with reporting fidelity, challenges still exist.

6.8.2.  SACM Implications

   As much as possible, allow the end users of the reporting capability
   to determine exactly what level of fidelity they need to achieve
   their goals.

6.9.  Evaluation Guidance is Platform-Specific

6.9.1.  Lesson

   In the early days of OVAL, initial adoption of the effort was
   spearheaded by third party security vendors, as opposed to the
   primary source vendors for software.  As the effort matured, more



Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   primary source vendors became involved and adopted OVAL in some way.
   It quickly became evident that, while third party vendors made great
   strides in determining how to evaluate the security posture of many
   platforms and products, understanding the best way to evaluate is
   hard, and very platform-specific.  Additionally, OVAL content is
   costly to create, even for seasoned content authors, due to the need
   to understand these very low-level product and platform complexities.

6.9.2.  SACM Implications

   As cited above, the primary source vendors are best suited to provide
   evaluation guidance.  It is very challenging for third party
   organizations to truly understand platform-specific evaluation.
   Empower primary source vendors and other subject matter experts by
   providing simple and effective ways to provide this information.
   Also, as discussions on complex topics arise, engage these primary
   source vendors to understand their valuable views.

7.  Recommendations

   In order to successfully standardize the mechanisms by which endpoint
   posture assessment is performed, the following recommendations are
   offered to SACM for consideration.

7.1.  Use the OVAL System Characteristics Model for Encoding Collection
      Data

   The OVAL System Characteristics Model is used within the OVAL
   Language in order to encode the underlying data collected as part of
   endpoint posture assessment.  Each of the posture attributes
   collected by an OVAL-enabled tool can be represented using the OVAL
   System Characteristics Model.  As such, this model should be used as
   the basis for implementing at least one of the formats used to encode
   collected posture attributes within SACM.

   Within the OVAL System Characteristics Model, information such as
   metadata about the document (who/what created the document, creation
   timestamp, etc.), endpoint identification information (OS name, host
   name, and other asset-related information), and the foundational
   constructs to allow the encoding of posture attributes can be found.
   It is understood that modifications to the model will be required in
   order for it to fully implement all of the requirements for SACM.
   However, the use of this well-supported, standardized mechanism for
   encoding collected data is recommended as SACM begins moving from
   Information Model into Data Models and actual implementations.

   The expectation is that SACM will need to make use of multiple types
   of standardized formats to encompass a complete solution for endpoint



Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   posture assessment.  As such, the OVAL System Characteristics Model
   is likely to be used as one of multiple possible formats for encoding
   collected data.

7.2.  Use the OVAL Definitions Model for Collection and Evaluation
      Guidance

   Similar to the OVAL System Characteristics Model, the OVAL
   Definitions Model also has aspects that could be very useful in jump
   starting the development of a model to capture Collection Guidance.
   Collection Guidance is the mechanism by which a content author can
   dictate what rules should be used for collecting data from an
   endpoint.  While the OVAL Definitions Model, as it is today, is used
   for guidance of both Collection and Evaluation, it is well suited to
   serve as the base for Collection Guidance.

   This model provides several key features that should be used as
   building blocks for this capability.  For instance, within the OVAL
   Definitions Model, there is a series of structures that can serve as
   the base for instructing tools as to what data must be collected,
   including abstract structures for identifying required posture
   attributes, Variables, and Functions (which allow several types of
   data manipulation during collection).  The model also supports a
   number of different data types, such as strings, Booleans, integers,
   records, and others.

   While the recommendation is to make use of many of the structures
   found within the OVAL Definitions Model, it is equally important to
   note that the current approach for extending OVAL into various
   platforms is flawed, and should be fixed.  Specifically, for every
   new check that is to be added to the Language, a new concrete test
   must be created.  OVAL provides an abstract Test structure that must
   be extended to create checks (e.g., "registry_test," "file_test,"
   "ldap_test," etc.).  For SACM, it is imperative that a more scalable
   and flexible approach be implemented.

   One aspect of SACM that has been discussed, but only partially worked
   into the Information Model at the time, is the concept of high-level,
   platform-agnostic configuration items and low-level platform-specific
   configuration items.  In the discussed concept, the high-level items
   will capture the concepts of configuration that must be defined by
   those who write the guidance, while the low-level items will be
   provided by the appropriate vendors and/or subject matter experts to
   allow those that best know the platforms and products to instruct
   data collection.  With this approach in place, some of the concepts
   defined within the OVAL Definitions Model (e.g., Objects, which
   instruct tools as to what data to collect) will need to be modified
   or removed to accommodate the shift in how posture attributes are



Hansbury, et al.        Expires November 6, 2015               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft     OVAL and the SACM Information Model          May 2015


   defined for Collection.  As such, the recommendation is to use many
   of the underlying structures in the OVAL Definitions Model, including
   the data types, Variables, Functions, etc., as a base from which to
   build a complete solution for fulfilling the SACM Information Model.

   In addition to utility in supporting Collection Guidance, the same
   OVAL Definitions Model should also be used as the base for Evaluation
   Guidance.  Again, with the current OVAL Language, Collection and
   Evaluation are wrapped together in the single model.  The OVAL
   Definitions Model provides a series of structures that can be used to
   support Boolean logic statements, which could be useful for defining
   evaluation criteria and could be used as the basis for a further
   enhanced model for Evaluation.

7.3.  Do NOT Use the OVAL Results Model for Results Sharing

   Despite the fact that the Results Model could be used to share the
   results of the evaluation part of an endpoint posture assessment, the
   recommendation is to not use this model to represent this information
   within SACM.  The OVAL Results Model has, over the years, been a
   source of contention at times within the OVAL Community.  Some feel
   like it provides too little information, while others believe that it
   offers too much.  While there is some flexibility, in the form of
   OVAL Directives, in how much or how little information is included in
   the results, it really is not flexible enough to handle the broad set
   of requirements for SACM without extensive re-working.

   Furthermore, SACM is working hard at separating data collection and
   evaluation, which makes the OVAL Results Model a poor fit, as it was
   constructed with a more combined Collection and Evaluation framework.
   It is expected that to properly model all of the results requirements
   within SACM, an alternative solution will be required.

   While considering an alternative way to encode the results of an
   assessment, the following requirements have been stated by the OVAL
   Community as critical factors:

   o  Allow evaluation results with appropriate granularity

   o  Ensure support for enterprise scale uses

   o  Provide results that include only the actionable information

   o  Ensure that data is clear and identifiable within the results

   o  Ensure interoperability
