Abstract 
   
  This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with 
  network management protocols in the Internet community. In 
  particular, it defines a MIB for the Forwarding and Control Element 
  Separation (ForCES) Network Element (NE). The ForCES working group 
  is defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control the 
  behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE).

1. Introduction 
    
 
   The ForCES MIB is a primarily read-only MIB that captures information 
   related to the ForCES protocol. This includes state information about 
   the associations between CE(s) and FE(s) in the NE.  
    
   The ForCES MIB does not include information that is specified in 
   other MIBs, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.  
    
   More specifically , the information in the ForCES MIB relative to 
   associations includes:

   - identifiers of the elements in the association  
   - state of the association  
   - configuration parameters of the association  
   - statistics of the association  
    
   The relevant references from the ForCES requirements and architecture 
   documents are repeated below:  
    
   From the ForCES requirements RFC [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 4:  
    
     A NE MUST support the appearance of a single functional device. For 
     example, in a router, the TTL of the packet should be decremented 
     only once as it traverses the NE regardless of how many FEs through 
     which it passes.  However, external entities (e.g., FE managers and 
     CE managers) MAY have direct access to individual ForCES protocol 
     elements for providing information to transition them from the pre-
     association to post-association phase. 
      
   And [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 14: 
       
     1. The ability for a management tool (e.g., SNMP) to be used to 
     read(but not change) the state of FE SHOULD NOT be precluded.  
     2. It MUST NOT be possible for management tools (e.g., SNMP, etc) 
     to change the state of a FE in a manner that affects overall NE 
     behavior without the CE being notified. 
      
   According to the ForCES architecture RFC [RFC 3746], Section 3.3:  
      
     CE managers may be physically and logically separate entities that 
     configure the CE with FE information via such mechanisms as COPS-PR 
     [7] or SNMP [5]. 
      
   and [RFC 3746], Section 5.7:   
      
     RFC 1812 [2] also dictates that "Routers MUST be manageable by 
     SNMP". In general, for the post-association phase, most external 
     management tasks (including SNMP) should be done through 
     interaction with the CE in order to support the appearance of a 
     single functional device. Therefore, it is recommended that an SNMP 
     agent be implemented by CEs and that the SNMP messages received by 
     FEs be redirected to their CEs. AgentX framework defined in RFC 
     2741 ([6]) may be applied here such that CEs act in the role of 
     master agent to process SNMP protocol messages while FEs act in the 
     role of subagent to provide access to the MIB objects residing on 
     FEs.  AgentX protocol messages between the master agent (CE) and 
     the subagent (FE) are encapsulated and transported via ForCES, just 
     like data packets from any other application layer protocols.

2. Design of ForCES MIB 
    
   In an NE composed of one or more FEs and a single CE, the CE is 
   clearly aware of all associations and hence can provide this 
   information in a single ForCES MIB. In contrast, in an NE composed of 
   more than one CE, such association information is distributed and 
   hence more than one ForCES MIB may be necessary, unless this 
   information is aggregated into a single ForCES MIB by some means 
   beyond the scope of this document. Nevertheless, the ForCES MIB 
   design is compatible with both the single-CE and the multiple-CE 
   case. 
    
    
3. Association State  
    
   Association state as shown in the MIB is considered from the CE's 
   point of view: 
   - An association is in the DOWN state if the CE has not received any 
     message (heartbeat or other protocol message) from the FE within a 
     given time period or if an Association Teardown message has been 
     sent by the CE. 
   - An association is in the ESTABLISHING state as long as no message 
     has been received from the FE after the CE has sent a positive 
     Association Setup Response message. 
   - An association is in the UP state in all other cases. 
    
   Note that it is left to the implementers to choose how long entries 
   of associations in the DOWN state remain in the MIB until they are 
   removed, if at all. 
 
   The ForCES protocol may be used by the CE to query the FE Protocol 
   LFB about some of the configuration parameters. However, such queries 
   may obviously be issued only when the association is in the UP state. 
   Hence any MIB value that corresponds to such a parameter can only be 
   considered valid as long as the association is in the UP state. 
   [Note: there is no such parameter in the MIB at this time]  
    
   [Note: Should the MIB indicate whether associations have been 
   rejected ? Can this be a weakness exploited by DDoS if the MIB lists 
   all such rejected associations ?] 
    
4. ForCES MIB Definition 
    
   For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the 
   following information is provided by the MIB:  
    
    
   - Current state of the association:

     DOWN: the CE(s) indicated by the CE ID and FE(s) indicated by the 
   FE ID are not associated. 
    
    ESTABLISHING: transient state until the association has been 
   established. See Section 3 above for details. 
    
    UP: the CE(s) indicated by the CE ID and FE(s) indicated by the FE 
   ID are associated. 
    
   Association statistics: 
    
   - Time when the association attained the UP state. 
    
   - Time when the association appeared in the MIB. 
    
   - Number of transitions to ESTABLISHING state since the association 
   appeared in the MIB. 
    
   - Number of transitions to UP state since the association appeared in 
   the MIB. 
    
   - Number of ForCES messages sent/received since the association 
   attained the UP state.

Security Considerations 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module may be considered 
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environment. 
 
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
