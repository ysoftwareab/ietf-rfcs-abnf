Abstract 

   This document defines the Device Owner attribute.  It indicates the 
   entity (e.g., company, organization, department, agency) that owns 
   the device.  This attribute may be included in public key 
   certificates and attribute certificates. 

Status of this Memo

   publication of this document. Please review these documents 
   carefully, as they describe your rights and restrictions with respect

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the Device Owner attribute.  It indicates the 
   entity (e.g., company, organization, department, agency) that owns 
   the device.  This attribute is intended to be used in public key 
   certificates [RFC5280] and attribute certificates [RFC5755]. 

   This attribute may be used in automated authorization decisions. For 
   example, when two peers are deciding whether to communicate each 
   could check that the device owner present in the other device's 
   certificate is on an "approved" list.  This check is performed in 
   addition to certification path validation [RFC5280].  The mechanism 
   for managing the "approved" list is beyond the scope of this 
   document. 

   NOTE: This document does not provide an equivalent LDAP schema 
   specification as this attribute is targeted at public key 
   certificates [RFC5280] and attribute certificates [RFC5755].  
   Definition of an equivalent LDAP schema is left to a future 
   specification. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The attribute is defined using ASN.1 [X.680] through [X.683]. 

2. Device Owner 

   The Device Owner attribute indicates the entity (e.g., company, 
   organization, department, agency) that owns the Device with which 
   this attribute is associated.  Device Owner is an object identifier.

Internet-Draft          Device Owner Attribute            February 2010 
    

   The following object identifier identifies the Device Owner 
   attribute: 

     id-deviceOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 69 
     } 

   The ASN.1 syntax for the Device Owner attribute is as follows: 

     at-deviceOwner ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
       TYPE                    OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
       EQUALITY MATCHING RULE  objectIdentifierMatch 
       IDENTIFIED BY           id-deviceOwner 
     } 

   There MUST only be one value of Device Owner associated with a 
   device.  Distinct owners MUST be represented in separate 
   certificates. 

3. Security Considerations 

   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization process, the 
   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each value must ensure 
   that the correct value is applied.  Including this attribute in a 
   public key certificate or attribute certificate ensures the value for 
   the device owner is integrity protected. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
