Abstract 
    
   The routing protocols Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) 
   [RFC2328], Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) [ISO] 
   [RFC1195] and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) [RFC2453] currently 
   define Clear Text and MD5 (Message Digest 5) [RFC1321] methods for 
   authenticating protocol packets. Recently effort has been made to add 
   support for the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) family of hash functions 
   for the purpose of authenticating routing protocol packets for RIP 
   [RFC4822], IS-IS [RFC5310] and OSPF [RFC5709]. 
    
   To encourage interoperability between disparate implementations, it 
   is imperative that we specify the expected minimal set of algorithms 
   thereby ensuring that there is at least one algorithm that all 
   implementations will have in common.   
    
   This document examines the current set of available algorithms with 
   interoperability and effective cryptographic authentication 
   protection being the principle considerations. Cryptographic 
   authentication of these routing protocols requires the availability 
   of the same algorithms in disparate implementations. It is desirable 
   that newly specified algorithms should be implemented and available 
   in routing protocol implementations because they may be promoted to 
   requirements at some future time.

1. Introduction 
    
   Most routing protocols include three different types of 
   authentication schemes: Null authentication, Clear Text Password and 
   a Cryptographic Authentication scheme. NULL authentication is 
   equivalent to having no authentication scheme at all.  
    
   In a clear text scheme, also known as, simple password scheme, the 
   password is exchanged in the clear on the network and anyone with 
   physical access to the network can learn the password and compromise 
   the integrity of the routing domain. While the Password scheme 
   protects from accidental establishment of routing session in a given 
   domain, it offers little additional protection. 
    
   In a cryptographic authentication scheme, routers share a secret key 
   which is used to generate a keyed MD5 (or other) digest which is used 
   for authenticating the protocol packets.  
    
   There have been an escalating series of attacks on MD5 which raises 
   concerns about the remaining useful lifetime of this hash algorithm. 
    
   It should be noted that these attacks may not necessarily result in 
   direct vulnerabilities in Keyed-MD5 as used in the routing protocols 
   for authentication purposes, because the colliding message may not 
   necessarily be a syntactically correct protocol packet. There is a 
   however a need felt to deprecate MD5 in favor of stronger hash 
   algorithms. 
    
   In light of these considerations there have been proposals for adding 
   support of the SHA family of hash algorithms for authenticating 
   routing protocol packets in RIP, IS-IS and OSPF. 
    
   However, the nature of cryptography is that algorithmic    
   improvement is an ongoing process and as is the exploration and 
   refinement of attack vectors. An algorithm believed to be strong 
   today may be demonstrated to be weak tomorrow. Given this, the choice 
   of preferred algorithm should favor the minimization of the 
   likelihood of it being compromised quickly.

   It should be recognized that preferred algorithm(s) will change over 
   time in to adapt to the evolving threats. The selection of preferred 
   algorithms may well not be reflected in the base protocol 
   specification. As protocols are extended the preference for presently 
   stronger algorithms presents a problem both on the question of 
   interoperability of existing and future implementations with respect 
   to standards and operational preference for the configuration as 
   deployed. This document intends to provide guidance to implementors 
   in anticipation of operational preference. 
    
2. Requirements Terminology 
 
   Keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and   
   "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described   
   in RFC2119. [RFC2119] 
 
3. Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) 
    
   The IS-IS specification allows for authentication of its Protocol 
   Data Units (PDUs) via the authentication TLV (TLV 10) in the PDU. The 
   base specification had provisions only for clear text passwords. RFC 
   5304 [RFC5304] extends the authentication capabilities by providing  
   HMAC-MD5 authentication for IS-IS PDUs. 
    
   RFC 5310 [RFC5310] adds support for the use of SHA family of hash 
   algorithms for authenticating IS-IS PDUs. 
    
3.1 Authentication Scheme Selection 
 
   In order for IS-IS implementations to interoperate, they must support 
   one or more authentication schemes in common. This section specifies 
   the preference for standards conformant IS-IS implementations, which 
   desire to utilize the security feature. 
    
   The earliest interoperability requirement for authentication as 
   stated by [ISO] [RFC1195] required all implementations to support 
   Clear Text Password.  This authentication scheme's utility is limited 
   to precluding the accidental introduction of a new IS into a 
   broadcast domain. We believe that operators should not use this 
   scheme as provides no protection against an attacker with access to 
   the broadcast domain as anyone can determine the secret password 
   through inspection of the PDU. It MUST presently be implemented but 
   its use should be deprecated. 
    
   [RFC5304] defines HMAC-MD5 implementation as a MUST for 
   cryptographically authenticating the IS-IS PDUs. HMAC-MD5 is 
   currently the preferred algorithm for IS-IS deployments and it may  
   be superseded by the generic cryptographic authentication scheme

   defined in [RFC5310]. HMAC-MD5 MUST be implemented, but its use may 
   be deprecated in future. 
    
   IS-IS implementations SHOULD provide support for the generic 
   cryptographic authentication scheme [RFC5310] and it is our 
   understanding that interoperability considerations will require 
   change to a MUST as operators migrate to this authentication scheme. 
    
3.2 Authentication Algorithm Selection 
 
   For IS-IS implementations to interoperate, they must have support for 
   one or more authentication algorithms in common. 
    
   This section details the authentication algorithm requirements for 
   standards conformant IS-IS implementations. 
    
   HMAC-MD5 is a MUST as defined in [RFC5304]. It is our belief that 
   this will be superseded by HMAC-SHA-1 as defined in [RFC5310]. HMAC-
   MD5 MUST be implemented, but its use may be deprecated in future. 
   Operators should consider migration to HMAC-SHA-1. 
    
   Implementations may start providing support for HMAC-SHA-256/HMAC-
   SHA-384/HMAC-SHA-512 as these algorithms may be necessary in the 
   future. 
    
4. Open Shortest Path First Version 2 (OSPFv2) 
 
   OSPFv2 as defined in [RFC2328] includes three different types of 
   authentication schemes: Null authentication, simple password and 
   cryptographic authentication. NULL authentication is semantically 
   equivalent to no authentication. In the simple password scheme of 
   authentication, the passwords are exchanged in the clear on the 
   network. Anyone with physical access to the network can learn the 
   password and compromise the security of the OSPFv2 domain. 
    
   In the cryptographic authentication scheme, the OSPFv2 routers on a 
   common network/subnet are configured with a shared secret which is 
   used to generate a keyed MD5 digest for each packet. A monotonically 
   increasing sequence number scheme is used to protect against replay 
   attacks. 
    
   RFC 5709 [RFC5709] adds support for the use of SHA family of hash 
   algorithms for authentication of OSPFv2 packets. 
    
    
4.1 Authentication Scheme Selection 
 
   For OSPF implementations to interoperate, they must have one or more 
   authentication schemes in common. This section specifies the 
 
 
Bhatia and Manral                                              [Page 5] 
Internet Draft                                            November 2009 
 
 
   requirements for standards conformant OSPFv2 implementations, which 
   desire to utilize the authentication feature. 
    
   Null Authentication is a MUST as defined in [RFC2328], its use is 
   deprecated in any context where the operator wishes to authenticate 
   the OSPFv2 packets in their network. 
    
   Simple Password defined as a MUST in [RFC2328] should only be used 
   when the operator is seeking only to preclude the accidental 
   introduction of a router into the domain. This scheme is not useful 
   when the operator wants to authenticate the OSPFv2 packets. 
    
   Cryptographic Authentication is a MUST as defined in [RFC2328] and 
   all conformant implentations MUST support this. 
    
4.2 Authentication Algorithm Selection 
 
   For OSPFv2 implementations to interoperate, they must support one or 
   more cryptographic authentication algorithms in common. 
    
   Keyed MD5 as defined in [RFC2328] is a MUST. It is our belief that 
   HMAC-SHA-1 and HMAC-SHA-256 as defined in [RFC5709] will likely be 
   preferred in the future. Keyed MD5 MUST be implemented, but its use 
   may be deprecated in future. Implementations must provide support for 
   HMAC-SHA-256 as this will become the algorithm of choice. 
    
   Operators should consider migration to HMAC-SHA-256 if they desire a 
   stronger cryptographic algorithm for authentication of OSPFv2 
   packets. 
    
   Implementations may start providing support for HMAC-SHA-1/HMAC-SHA-
   384/HMAC-SHA-512 as these algorithms may be preferred in the future. 
    
5. Open Shortest Path First Version 3 (OSPFv3) 
    
   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] relies on the IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) 
   [RFC4302] and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] in 
   order to provide integrity, authentication, and/or confidentiality. 
    
   The algorithm requirements for AH and ESP are described in [RFC4835] 
   and are not discussed here. 
    
6. Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2) 
 
   RIPv2, originally specified in [RFC1388], then [RFC1723], has been 
   finalized in STD56 [RFC2453]. If the Address Family Identifier of the 
   first (and only the first) entry in the message is 0xFFFF, then the 
   remainder of the entry contains the authentication. The [RFC2453] 
   version of the protocol provides for authenticating packets using a 
 
 
Bhatia and Manral                                              [Page 6] 
Internet Draft                                            November 2009 
 
 
   simple password of not more than 16 octets, in which the password is 
   sent in clear. 
    
   "RIP-2 MD5 Authentication" [RFC2082] added support for Keyed-MD5 
   authentication, where a digest is appended to the end of the RIP 
   packet. "RIPv2 Cryptographic Authentication" [RFC4822] obsoleted 
   [RFC2082] and added the SHA family of hash algorithms to the list of 
   cryptographic authentications that can be used to protect RIPv2, 
   whereas [RFC2082] previously specified only the use of Keyed MD5.  
    
6.1 Authentication Scheme Selection 
    
   For RIPv2 implementations to interoperate, one or more authentication 
   schemes must be supported in common. This section specifies the 
   requirements for standards conformant RIPv2 implementations, which 
   utilize the authentication feature. 
    
   Simple Password defined as a MUST in [RFC2453] should only be used 
   when the operator wishes to preclude the accidental introduction of a 
   RIP router into the domain. This authentication scheme is useful, but 
   not when the operator wants to protect RIPv2 message exchange in a 
   potentially hostile environment. 
    
   Implementations MUST provide support for Simple Password, but its 
   operational use is deprecated. 
    
   Keyed-MD5 as defined in [RFC2082] is a MUST. However, [RFC2082] has 
   been obsoleted by [RFC4822] Cryptographic Authentication. Compliant 
   implementations MUST provide support for Keyed-MD5 as described in 
   [RFC2082] but should recognize that this is superseded by 
   Cryptographic Authentication as defined in [RFC4822].  
    
   Implementations should provide support for [RFC4822] Cryptographic 
   Authentication as it will likely be the preferred authentication 
   method in the future. 
      
6.2 Authentication Algorithm Selection 
 
   For RIPv2 implementations to interoperate, one or more authentication 
   algorithms must be supported in common that can be used for 
   authentication. 
   The keyed MD5 algorithm in [RFC2082] and [RFC4822] must be 
   implemented. It is our belief that it will be superseded by HMAC-SHA-
   1 also available in [RFC4822]. Keyed MD5 MUST be implemented for 
   interoperability purposes, but its use may be deprecated in future.  
    
   Implementations should provide support for HMAC-SHA-1 used in 
   preference to keyed MD5 the future. 
    
 
 
Bhatia and Manral                                              [Page 7] 
Internet Draft                                            November 2009 
 
 
   Operators should consider migration to HMAC-SHA-1 if they want to use 
   stronger cryptographic algorithms for authenticating RIPv2 packets. 
    
   Implementations should consider providing support for HMAC-SHA-
   256/HMAC-SHA-384/HMAC-SHA-512 as these algorithms may be preferred in 
   the future. 
    
7. Routing Information Protocol for IPv6 (RIPng) 
 
   RIPng [RFC2080] relies on the IPv6 AH and IPv6 ESP to provide 
   integrity, authentication, and/or confidentiality. 
    
   The algorithm requirements for AH and ESP are described in [RFC4835] 
   and are not discussed here. 
    
8. Security Considerations  
    
   The cryptographic mechanisms referenced in this document provide only 
   authentication algorithms. These algorithms do not provide 
   confidentiality. Encrypting the content of the packet and thereby 
   providing confidentiality is not considered in the definition of the 
   routing protocols. 
    
   The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic 
   strength of the underlying hash function and on the size and quality 
   of the key. The feasibility of attacking the integrity of routing 
   protocol messages protected by Digests may be significantly more 
   limited than that of other data, however preference for one family of 
   algorithms over another may also change independently of the 
   perceived risk to a particular protocol. 
    
   To ensure greater security, the keys used should be changed 
   periodically and implementations MUST be able to store and use more 
   than one key at the same time. Operational experience suggests that 
   the lack of periodic rekeying is a source of significant exposure and 
   that the lifespan of shared keys in the network is frequently 
   measured in years. 
    
   While simple password schemes are well represented in the document 
   series and in conformant implementations of the protocols, the 
   inability to offer either integrity or identity protection are 
   sufficient reason to strongly discourage their use. 
    
   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic 
   algorithms for use in the authentication of routing protocol packets 
   being exchanged between adjacent routing processes.  The 
   cryptographic algorithms identified in this document are not known to 
   be broken at the current time, and ongoing cryptographic research so 
   far leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure in the

   foreseeable future. We expect that new revisions of this document 
   will be issued in the future to reflect current thinking on best 
   practice in this area.
