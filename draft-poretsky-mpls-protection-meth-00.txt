   ABSTRACT
   This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking MPLS 
   protection mechanisms.  An overview of existing MPLS Protection 
   terminology and functionality is provided as as background for the 
   methodology.  The methodology can be applied to any MPLS Protection
   mechanism such as Headend Reroute, Standby LSP, Fast Reroute Detour 
   Mode, and Fast Reroute Bypass Mode.  The data plane is measured to 
   obtain the benchmarking metrics.  Discussion is included to explain 
   the differences between MPLS Protection mechanisms, the network 
   events that cause failover, and the benefits of measuring the data 
   plane for black-box MPLS Protection benchmarking.   Measurements can

   1. Introduction
 
   MPLS-TE offers three options for Protection Mechanisms to reroute
   traffic from a Primary LSP to a Backup LSP:  Headend Reroute, 
   Standby LSP, and Fast Reroute.  The purpose of these mechanisms is 
   to provide protection for link and node failures.  Each of the 
   mechanisms offers a distinct tradeoff in the amount of network 
   configuration and level of protection.

   Headend Reroute is the default Protection Mechanism for MPLS-TE.
   Headend Reroute establishes a backup LSP that is dynamically 
   signaled after a failure event has occurred.  Headend Reroute has 
   the advantage that a backup is not utilizing resources prior to 
   failure.  Its disadvantage is its long failover time that produces 
   high packet loss during failure that can be greater than that of IGP 
   Convergence.  The most basic topology for dynamic headend reroute is 
   shown in Figure 1.

	Figure 1.  Topology for Headend Reroute

   The Standby LSP is an extension to RSVP-TE signaling in which a 
   backup LSP is signaled in advance from primary Ingress to Egress.  
   Its advantage is less than 500msec failover, but it requires high 
   resource utilization at the ingress to maintain unused backup LSPs.
   The topology for Standby LSP is identical to that for Dynamic 
   Headend Reroute shown in Figure 1, but the Backup Path is 
   pre-established.

   FRR is an extension to TE specified in to provide a Protection
   Mechanism with fast failover characteristics to minimize packet 
   loss while reducing processing load at the tunnel ingress.  FRR 
   provides link and node protection.  The primary and backup LSPs 
   are signaled using an optional extension to the Resource 
   Reservation Protocol with TE extensions (RSVP-TE).	With FRR  
   midpoint LSRs along the primary path are responsible for laying out 
   the protected path in the downstream direction, toward the egress.  
   This provides local protection for link and node failure and
   achieves a goal of less than 45msec failover while minimizing
   resource utilization at the ingress.  FRR does require greater 
   network configuration and increases signaling complexity.  There 
   are two FRR modes, Bypass and Detour, each with distinct advantages
   for operational configuration.   The topology for FRR is shown in 
   Figure 2.

   This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking MPLS 
   protection mechanisms.  The methodology can be applied to any MPLS 
   Protection mechanism such as Headend Reroute, Standby LSP, Fast 
   Reroute Detour Mode, and Fast Reroute Bypass Mode.  The data plane 
   is measured to obtain the benchmarking metrics.  Discussion is 
   included to explain the network events that cause failover and 
   benefits of measuring the data plane for black-box MPLS Protection   
   benchmarking. Measurements can be used to compare failover 
   performance of different Label-Switched Routers and evaluate the 
   different MPLS protection mechanisms.

   2.  Existing definitions

   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are
   indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   Methodology for benchmarking MPLS protection mechanisms can be 
   developed completely with use of terminology existing in IETF RFCs
   and drafts produced in the MPLS Working Group. The reader is assumed

   3. Test Considerations

   This section discusses three fundamentals of MPLS Protection 
   testing:  the types of network events that cause failover, 
   indications for failover, the use of data traffic, LSP Scaling,
   and IGP Selection.

   3.1 Types of Failover Events
   Causes of reroute are administration change, link failure, node 
   failure, and path optimization.  Indication for these types of 
   failures wil vary whether the failure is local or remote.  
   
   3.2 Network Indications for Failover
   Local failures can be detected via SONET failure with directly 
   connected LSR.  For an ingress administrative change a 
   make-before-break should occur to prevent any packet loss.  
   
   Remote failures are indicated via Control Plane signaling.  
   Signaling indications are Negative RSVP Indication (loss of PATH 
   Refresh messages from upstream node or loss of RESV Refresh messages 
   from downstream node), Positive RSVP Indication (receipt of PATHTear

           	        MPLS Protection Mechanisms

   Message from upstream node or receipt of RESVTear Message from 
   downstream node), or change to the TE-LSDB via the IGP.  Different
   MPLS Protection Mechanisms and different implementations use 
   different failure indications.  For remote failure cases, the 
   methodologies in this document evaluate failover performance
   independent of the implemented signaling indication mechanism.

   3.3 Use of Data Traffic for MPLS Protection Benchmarking
	
   Customers of service providers use packet loss as the metric for
   failover time.  Packet loss is an externally observable event 
   having direct impact on customers' application performance.  MPLS 
   Protection mechanisms exist to minimize packet loss in the event 
   of failure.  For this reason it is important to develop a standard 
   router benchmarking methodology and terminology for measuring MPLS 
   Protection that uses packet loss as a metric.  At a known rate for 
   forwarding rate, packet loss can be measured and used to calculate 
   the Failover time.  Measurement of control plane signaling to 
   establish Backup paths is not enough to verify failover.  Failover 
   is best determined when packets are actually traversing the Backup 
   Path.   

   An additional benefit of using packet loss for calculation of 
   Failover time is that it enables black-box tests to be designed.  
   Data traffic can be offered at line-rate to the device under test 
   (DUT), an emulated network event as described above can be forced to 
   occur, and packet loss can be externally measured to calculate the 
   convergence time.  Knowledge of the DUT architecture is not required. 
   There is no need to rely on the DUT to produce the test results.  

   3.4 LSP Scaling
   Failover Time performance may vary with the number of established 
   primary and backup LSPs.  The methodologies may be used for any
   number of LSPs.  It is intended with Fast Reroute that the less 
   than	45msec failover requirement is met when scaling the number 
   of protected LSPs.

   3.5 Selection of IGP
   The methodologies can be used with ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE.  
 
   4. Test Setup
 
   There are numerous test setups for MPLS Performance Benchmarking due 
   to the many roles that an LSR can be along the LSP.  A single DUT 
   should be tested in each of these roles.  The Test Setups to use are 
   shown in Figures 3 through 10.

   5. Test Cases
   5.1 Node Protection
   5.1.1 Ingress
   5.1.1.1 Local SONET Failure

      Objective
	To benchmark the MPLS failover time due to a Local
	SONET Link failure event at the Ingress.

      Test Setup
	Use Figure 3.  The DUT is the LSP ingress.
	The test device(s) will have three interfaces to the 
	DUT:
	1. Transmit IP Traffic to DUT
	2. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's Primary interface
	3. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's Backup interface
	   after failover

      Test Configuration
	The ingress can be configured for Headend Reroute,
	Standby LSP, or Fast Reroute.  

	The test device(s) should emulate the Primary Path 
	Midpoint, Backup Path Midpoint, and Egress Node. The 
	test device sources an offered load of IP packets to 
	the DUT ingress interface and receives switched MPLS
	from the DUT.  

      Procedure 
	1. Enable either IGP-TE (ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE) on the 
	   interfaces.
	2. Advertise matching IGP TE-LSDB routes from Tester 
	   to DUT on both primary and backup interfaces.
	3. Establish Primary LSP.
	4. Establish Backup LSP (Step 4 does not apply for 
	   Headend Reroute).
	5. Send IP traffic at maximum Forwarding Rate to DUT. 
	   IP destination address must match FEC for Primary LSP.

	6. Verify traffic switched over Primary LSP.
	7. Remove SONET on DUT's Ingress Interface to Primary LSP.
	8. Observe Packet Loss.
	9. Measure Failover Time as DUT detects the link down event 
	   and switches MPLS traffic over the Backup LSP.

	Results
	Packet loss upon SONET failure at Ingress's (DUT) primary 
	interface should be 100%.  The Failover Time is the time to 
	restore 100% of the traffic.  The measured failover time is 
	influenced by the Local SONET failure indication and 
	Hardware update time.  The result with Headend Reroute is 
	also influenced by the time to establish the Backup LSP.

	3. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's Backup interface
	   after failover

      Test Configuration
	The ingress can be configured for Headend Reroute,
	Standby LSP, or Fast Reroute.  

	The test device(s) should emulate the Primary Path 
	Midpoint, Backup Path Midpoint, and Egress Node. The 
	test device sources an offered load of IP packets to 
	the DUT ingress interface and receives switched MPLS
	from the DUT.  

      Procedure 
	1. Enable either IGP-TE (ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE) on the 
	   interfaces.

	8. Observe Packet Loss.
	9. Measure Failover Time as DUT detects the link down event 
	   and switches MPLS traffic over the Backup LSP.

	Reroute and Standby LSPs, additional mid-point nodes 
	may be added to the test setup.  The test device(s) 
	will have three interfaces to the DUT:

	   after failover

      Test Configuration
	The ingress can be configured for Headend Reroute or 
        Standby LSP.

	The test device(s) should emulate the Primary Path 
	Midpoint, Backup Path Midpoint, and Egress Node. The 
	test device sources an offered load of IP packets to 
	the DUT ingress interface and receives switched MPLS
	from the DUT.  

      Procedure 
	1. Enable either IGP-TE (ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE) on the 
	   interfaces.
	2. Advertise matching IGP TE-LSDB routes from Tester 
	   to DUT on both primary and backup interfaces.
	3. Establish Primary LSP.
	4. Establish Backup LSP (Step 4 does not apply for 
	   Headend Reroute).
	5. Send IP traffic at maximum Forwarding Rate to DUT. 
	   IP destination address must match FEC for Primary LSP.
	6. Verify traffic switched over Primary LSP.

	Results
	Failover Time is the period starting with the first occurence 
	of packet loss and ending with full restoration of 100% of the 
	traffic.  Traffic loss is first observed upon receipt and 
	processing of the control plane indication at the DUT.  At 
	this time the DUT stops sending traffic on the primary LSP
	and switches it to the Backup LSP.  The Failover Time is the
	time for the DUT to switch the traffic.  The test device 
	packet generation and forwarding time is inherently not a 
	factor in the measurement.

   5.1.2 PLR
   5.1.2.1 Ingress PLR

      Objective
	To benchmark the MPLS failover time due to a Local SONET Link 
        failure event at the Ingress also configured as PLR with 
        node protection.

      Test Setup
	Use Figure 9.  The DUT is the LSP ingress. All other nodes 
	indicated in the figure are simulated by a test device. 
	The test device(s) will have three interfaces to the DUT:
	1. Transmit IP Traffic to DUT
	2. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's Primary interface
	3. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's Backup interface
	   after failover

      Test Configuration
	The ingress is configured for FRR.

	The test device(s) should emulate FRR Primary Path 
	Midpoint, Backup Path Midpoint, and Egress Node. The 
	test device sources an offered load of IP packets to 
	the DUT ingress interface and receives switched MPLS

	Results
	Packet loss upon SONET failure at Ingress's (DUT) primary 
	interface should be 100%.  The Failover Time is the time to 
	restore 100% of the traffic.  The measured failover time is 
	influenced by the Local SONET failure indication and 
	Hardware update time.

   5.1.2.2 Midpoint PLR
      Objective
	To benchmark the MPLS failover time, with node protection
	provided, due to a SONET Link failure event at the Midpoint PLR. 
	
      Test Setup
	Use Figure 5.  The DUT is a midpoint on the primary LSP.
	The reamining nodes, in the indicated topology are simulated
	by the test device. 
	The test device(s) will have three interfaces to the 
	DUT:
	1. Transmit MPLS Traffic to DUT
	2. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's Primary interface
	3. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's Backup interface
	   after failover

      Test Configuration
	The DUT as midpoint PLR is configured for FRR.
	The test device(s) should emulate FRR Ingress, Primary Path 
	Midpoint, Backup Path Midpoint, and Egress Node. The 
	test device sources an offered load of MPLS packets to 
	the DUT ingress interface and receives switched MPLS
	from the DUT.  

      Procedure 
	1. Enable either IGP-TE (ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE) on the 
	   interfaces.
	2. Advertise matching IGP TE-LSDB routes from Tester 
	   to DUT on both primary and backup interfaces.
	3. Establish Primary LSP with Tester as in the ingress.
	4. Establish Backup LSP.
	5. Send labeled traffic at maximum Forwarding Rate to DUT. 
	   Label must match the one received from DUT.
	6. Verify traffic switched over Primary LSP.
	7. Remove SONET on DUT's interface to downstream Midpoint 
	   LSR on Primary LSP path.
	8. Observe Packet Loss.
	9. Measure Failover Time as DUT detects the link down event 
	   and switches MPLS traffic over the Backup LSP.

	Results
	Packet loss upon SONET failure on midpoint LSRs (DUT) primary LSP 
	interface should be 100%.  The Failover Time is the time to 
	restore 100% of the traffic.  The measured failover time is 
	influenced by the Local SONET failure indication and 
	Hardware update time.

   5.1.4 Merge Node
      
      Objective
	To benchmark the MPLS failover time and packet loss at the 
	merge node due to failure event along the protected path
	somewhere upstream.

      Test Setup
	Use Figure 6.  The DUT is the Merge Node. All other nodes are
	simulated by the test device and the failure is assumed to 
	occur along the protected path upstream to the DUT. 
	The test device(s) will have three interfaces to the DUT:
	1. Transmit MPLS Traffic to DUT inbound primary Interface
	2. Transmit MPLS traffic to DUT's Backup interface
	3. Receive MPLS traffic from DUT's primary outbound interface
	   before and after the failover 

      Test Configuration
	The Merge Node can be configured for merging Backup Paths using
	Sender-Template specific method and merging Detours using Path-
      Specifi Method.  The test device(s) should emulate the Point of 
      LLocal Repair, Primary Path Midpoint, Backup Path Midpoint, and 
      Egress Node.  The test device sources an offered load of MPLS 
      packets to  the DUT inbound interfaces and receives switched MPLS
	from the DUT as an egress.  

      Procedure 
	1. Enable either IGP-TE (ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE) on the 
	   interfaces.
	2. Advertise matching IGP TE-LSDB routes from Tester 
	   to DUT on both primary and backup interfaces.
	3. Establish Primary LSP with DUT as the potential Merge Node.
	4. Establish Backup/Detour LSP with DUT as a Merge Node.
	5. Send MPLS traffic at maximum Forwarding Rate to DUT along the
	   Primary Path. 
	6. Configure the Merge Node to have common outgoing interfaces
	   and the next-hop tester interface.
	7. Verify that the DUT correctly identifies the Protected and 
	   Backup LSP based on Sender-Template specific Method and 
           Path-Specific Method.
	8. Verify traffic received at the emulated egress is not 
           affected after the failure has occurred and PLR has switched 
           to the Backup LSP.
	9. Observe Packet Loss and observe packet re-ordering if any.
	10. If there is packet loss measure the convergence time until 
	   the DUT stabilizes switches MPLS traffic to the merged LSP.

	Results
	Packet loss should be ideally 0% once the PLR switches to the 
        backup and merging takes place at the DUT. If there is packet loss, 
        the measured time should be less than that specified in 
        [MPLS-FRR-EXT].

   5.1.5 Merge Node and Egress

      Objective
	To benchmark the MPLS failover time and packet loss at the 
	merge node/Egress due to failure event along the protected path
	somewhere upstream.

      Test Setup
	Use Figure 10.  The DUT is the Merge Node. All other nodes are
	simulated by the test device and the failure is assumed to 
	occur along the protected path upstream to the DUT. 
	The test device(s) will have three interfaces to the DUT:
	1. Transmit MPLS Traffic to DUT inbound primary Interface
	2. Transmit MPLS traffic to DUT's Backup interface
	3. Receive IP traffic from DUT's primary outbound interface
	   before and after the failover 

      Test Configuration
	The Merge Node can be configured for merging Backup Paths using
	Sender-Template specific method and merging Detours using Path
        -Specific Method. The test device(s) should emulate the Point of 
        Local Repair, Primary Path Midpoint, Backup Path Midpoint, and 
        Egress Node.  The test device sources an offered load of MPLS 
        packets to the DUT inbound interfaces and receives switched MPLS
	from the DUT as an egress.  

      Procedure 
	1. Enable either IGP-TE (ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE) on the 
	   interfaces.
	2. Advertise matching IGP TE-LSDB routes from Tester 
	   to DUT on both primary and backup interfaces.

	   after the failure has occurred and PLR has switched to the 
           Backup LSP.
	9. Observe Packet Loss and observe packet re-ordering if any.
	10. If there is packet loss measure the convergence time until the 
           DUT stabilizes and maps the IP traffic correctly to the 
           destination.

	Results
	Packet loss should be ideally 0% once the PLR switches to the backup 
	and merging takes place at the DUT. If there is packet loss, the 
        measured time should be less than that specified in [MPLS-FRR-EXT].
