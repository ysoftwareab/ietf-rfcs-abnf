  Number of Generic Associated Channel Labels in the MPLS Label Stack
                    draft-many-mpls-multiple-gal-01

Abstract

   This document describes the requirements for using multiple Generic
   Associated Channel Labels (GALs) in an MPLS label stack.  As a
   result, the document updates RFC 5586 by removing the restriction
   imposed on the usage of GAL that limits the number of GAL in the MPLS
   label stack to one.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5085] defined the associated channel mechanism and the Associated
   Channel Header (ACH) for exchange of control, management, and
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) messages in
   Pseudowires (PWs).  [RFC5586] generalized that associated channel
   mechanism and the ACH for use in Sections, Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), and PWs as the Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) and
   introduced the generalized label-based exception mechanism using the
   Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL).

   [RFC5586] restricted the number of times a GAL can appear in an MPLS
   label stack to one time only.  This document updates [RFC5586] by
   removing that restriction for non-MPLS-TP networks.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Number of GAL in the MPLS Label Stack

   [RFC5586] has limited the number of GALs in an MPLS label stack:

      Furthermore, when present, the GAL MUST NOT appear more than once
      in the label stack.

   In some MPLS networks, e.g., when realizing Service Function Chaining
   with MPLS-based forwarding plane [RFC8595], putting more than a
   single GAL in the MPLS label stack can simplify the processing of OAM
   packets and, as a result, improve the performance.  An extension of
   the MPLS Echo Request and Reply protocol [RFC8029] in such an
   environment is discussed in [I-D.lm-mpls-sfc-path-verification].
   Because it is expected that a general Service Function does not
   support processing of MPLS echo request messages, a GAL being used
   within a basic unit of MPLS label stack to indicate that the payload
   is ACH-encapsulated OAM message.  And in the label-stacking case,
   multiple basic units on the MPLS label stack, and, consequently, GALs
   could be placed in an MPLS label stack.  Thus, this document removes
   the limit on the number of GALs present in an MPLS label stack by
   changing the statement in [RFC5586] as follows:

      Furthermore, in non-MPLS-TP networks, when present, the GAL MAY
      appear more than once in the label stack.

   [RFC5586] requires that when GAL is at the bottom of the label stack,
   it is followed by an ACH:

      Where the GAL is at the bottom of the label stack (i.e., S bit set
      to 1), then it MUST always be followed by an ACH.

   This document updates [RFC5586] by extending that requirement for
   environments when GAL is not at the bottom of the label stack as
   follows:

      Where GAL is present in the label stack, the label element at the
      bottom of the label stack (i.e., S bit set to 1) MUST always be
      followed by an ACH.

4.  Processing GAL when not at the Bottom of the Label Stack

   [Ed.note: Describe GAL processing by transit and egress nodes.
   Illustrate the transformation of the MPLS label stack as a packet
   transits through the domain.]

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request for IANA allocations.  This section
   should be removed before publication.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no further security considerations than those in [RFC5586].
