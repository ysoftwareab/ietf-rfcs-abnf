Abstract

   This document describes goals for Localized Mobility Management (LMM)
   for IP layer mobility, such Mobile IP and Mobile IPv6.  These goals
   are intended to guide the design of a protocol specification for LMM.
   Localized Mobility Management, in general, introduces enhancements to
   IP layer mobility protocols to reduce the amount of latency in IP
   layer mobility management messages exchanged between a Mobile Node
   (MN) and its peer entities. In addition, LMM seeks to reduce the
   amount of signaling over the global Internet when a mobile node
   traverses within a defined local domain.  The identified goals are
   essential for localized mobility management functionality. They are
   intended to be used as a guide for analysis on the observed benefits
   over the identified goals for architecting and deploying LMM schemes.

1. Introduction

   In order to meet the demands of real-time applications and the
   expectations of future wireless users for service level quality
   similar to the one of wireline users, IP layer mobility management is
   facing a number of technical challenges in terms of performance and
   scalability [4] [5] [6].  These manifest themselves as increased
   latencies in the control signaling between a Mobile Node and its peer
   entities, namely the Home Agent (HA) and its Corresponding Nodes
   (CNs).

   In the base Mobile IP protocols [1] [2], movement between two subnets
   requires that the Mobile Node obtain a new care-of address in the new
   subnet.  This allows the Mobile Node to receive traffic on the new
   subnet.  In order for the routing change to become effective,
   however, the Mobile Node must issue a binding update (also known in
   Mobile IPv4 as a Home Agent registration) to the Home Agent so that
   the Home Agent can change the routing from the previous subnet to the
   new subnet.  The binding update establishes a host route on the Home
   Agent between the Mobile Node's Home Address and its new care-of
   address.  In addition, if route optimization is in use [2], the
   Mobile Node may also issue binding updates to Correspondent Nodes to
   allow them to send traffic directly to the new care-of address rather
   than tunneling their traffic through the Home Agent.

   The same approach applies also to a number of other IP layer mobility
   management protocols.  For example, in the Host Identity Protocol
   (HIP) mobility management scheme, a Mobile Node sends an Readdress
   (REA) packet to its peer; this is very similar the Binding Updates
   send in Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization.  In general, IP layer
   mobility protocols maintain a binding between a host identifier and
   either one care-of address or a set of care-of addresses.  In Mobile
   IP, the home address acts as the host identifier, and only one
   care-of address is allowed.  In other IP layer mobility protocols the
   host identifier is typically something else and more than one care-of
   addresses may be allowed.

   After movement, traffic destined for the Mobile Node is sent to the
   old care-of address and is, effectively, dropped until the peer
   entities processes mobility management messages. If the Mobile Node
   is at some geographical and topological distance away from a peer
   entity, the amount of time involved in sending the binding updates
   may be greater than 100 hundred milliseconds. This latency in routing
   update may cause some packets for the Mobile Node to be lost at the
   old Access Router. Recently, Mobile IP has been extended by certain
   local mobility mechanisms, aiming to alleviate the above performance
   limitations; they are identified as hierarchical/regional or more
   generically Localized Mobility Management (LMM).

Internet-Draft    Localized Mobility Management Goals      December 2003


   LMM Localized mobility management schemes allow the Mobile Node to
   continue receiving traffic on the new subnet without any change in
   the bindings at the peer entities. The latency involved in updating
   the care-of-address bindings at far geographical and topological
   distances is eliminated or reduced until such time as the Mobile Node
   is in a position to manage the latency cost.

   Having provided some motivation and brief summary of the underlying
   principles of LMM, it is important to enumerate goals for LMM.

   Goals for LMM:

   o  reduce the signaling induced by changes in the point of attachment
      due to the movement of a host; reduction in signaling delay will
      minimize packet loss and possible session loss;

   o  reduce the usage of air-interface and network resources for
      mobility;

   o  reduce the processing overhead at the peer nodes, thereby
      improving protocol scalability;

   o  avoid or minimize the changes of, or impact to the Mobile Node,
      Home Agent or the Correspondent Node;

   o  avoid creating single points of failure;

   o  simplify the network design and provisioning for enabling LMM
      capability in a network;

   o  allow progressive LMM deployment capabilities.

   o  LMM should introduce no new security vulnerabilities.

   Identifying a solid set of requirements that will render the protocol
   internals, for some LMM scheme, robust enough to cater for the
   aforementioned considerations becomes essential in designing a widely
   accepted solution.  The remainder of this document present a set of
   requirements that encompass essential considerations for the design
   of an LMM scheme. It is with this foundation that we can seek to
   ensure that the resulting LMM solution will best preserve the
   fundamental philosophies and architectural principles of the Internet
   in practice today.

   This document is meant to capture the thinking and analysis of LMM
   that began in Spring 2001 and is not meant to bind any futures
   efforts that, due to gained wisdom, may wish to depart from it."

2. Terminology

   See [7] for mobility terminology used in this document.

   Peer entity A generic name used for nodes that communicate with a
      mobile node.  In Mobile IP and IPv6, the Home Agent and
      Correspondent Node are peer entities.


3. Requirements

   This section describes the requirements for a LMM solution. The
   requirements are relevant to both all IP layer local mobility
   management schemes, independent of the actual IP layer macro mobility
   protocol.

3.1 Intra-domain mobility

   LMM is introduced to minimize the signaling traffic to the peer
   entities, e.g. Home Agent and/or Correspondent Node(s), for
   intra-domain mobility (within a Local Coverage Area). This is the
   fundamental reason for introducing localized mobility management.  In
   the LMM infrastructure a peer entity outside the administration
   domain MUST always be able to address the mobile host by the same IP
   address, so that from the point of view of hosts outside the
   administration domain, the IP address of the mobile host remains
   fixed regardless of any changes in the Mobile Node's subnet.

3.2 Security

3.2.1 Security services

   LMM protocol MUST provide security services within the respective
   local coverage area.

   The security of exchanging LMM specific information and signaling
   MUST be ensured.  Security provisioning includes protecting the
   integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity of the transfer of LMM
   specific information within the administration domain. If applicable,
   replay protection MUST exist mutually between the LMM agents.

3.2.2 Non-interference with peer entities

   LMM protocol MUST NOT interfere with the security provisioning that
   exists between the peer entities and the Mobile Node.

3.2.3 No new vulnerabilities




Williams                  Expires June 3, 2004                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Localized Mobility Management Goals      December 2003


   LMM protocol MUST NOT introduce new security holes or the possibility
   for DOS-style attacks.

3.3 Induced LMM functional requirements

3.3.1 No additional functionality at peer entities

   Any Localized Mobility Management protocol MUST NOT inject any
   additional functionality over the base IP layer macro mobility
   protocol employed.  Thus, the LMM framework MUST NOT add any
   modifications or extensions to the peer entities, including Mobile IP
   or Mobile IPv6 Correspondent Node(s) and Home Agents.  It is
   essential to minimize the involvement of the Mobile Node in routing
   beyond what is in the basic mobility protocol.  Preferences, load
   balancing, and other complex schemes requiring heavy mobile node
   involvement in the mobility management task SHOULD BE avoided.

3.3.2 No changes to existing components

   Non-LMM-aware routers, hosts, Mobile IP and IPv6 Home Agents, and
   Mobile Nodes MUST be able to interoperate with LMM agents.

3.3.3 No additional messages to peer entities

   The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the number of messages between
   the mobile host and the respective peer entities. Indeed, the LMM
   framework MUST minimize the global signaling between the MN and its
   peers. The amount of regional signaling MUST NOT surpass the amount
   of global signaling that would have otherwise occurred if LMM were
   not present.

3.4 Scalability, Reliability, and Performance

3.4.1 Linear complexity

   The LMM complexity MUST increase at most linearly with the size of
   the local domain and the number of Mobile Nodes.

3.4.2 Linear routing state growth

   Any Localized Mobility Management protocol MUST assure that that LMM
   routing state scales at most linearly with the number of Mobile Nodes
   registered, and that the increase in routing state is confined to
   those ARs/ANRs involved in implementing the LMM protocol at hand.
   While host routes apparently cannot be eliminated by any mobility
   management protocol including base IP mobility, any LMM protocol MUST
   keep the number of host routes to a minimum.

Internet-Draft    Localized Mobility Management Goals      December 2003


3.4.3 No additional points of failure

   The LMM framework MUST NOT introduce additional points of failure in
   the network.  The current access router would be excluded from this
   requirement.

3.4.4 No worse performance

   The LMM framework MUST NOT degrade in any way the basic IP mobility
   performance of a mobile host communications with a peer entity.

3.4.5 Scalable expansion of the network

   The LMM framework MUST allow for scalable expansion of the network
   and provide for reasonable network configuration with regard to
   peering, inter-administrative domain connectivity, and other
   inter-administrative domain interoperability characteristics of
   interest to wireless ISPs. The LMM framework MUST NOT introduce any
   additional restrictions in how wireless ISPs configure their network,
   nor how they interconnect with other networks beyond those introduced
   by standard IP routing.  In addition, the amount of regional
   signaling MUST NOT increase as the Local Domain expands in size.

3.4.6 Resilience to topological changes

   The LMM protocols MUST be topology-independent. The LMM protocols
   MUST be able to adapt to topological changes within the domain. The
   topological changes may include the addition or removal/failure of
   LMM agents or that of changes in the routing of the local domain over
   which the LMM scheme is applied.

3.4.7 Header or Tunneling overhead

   The LMM framework MUST not prevent header compression from being
   applied. It is recommended that andidate LMM designs that require
   additional header overhead for tunnel be reviewed by the ROHC working
   group to determine if the header compressor can be restarted from
   transferred compressor context when handover occurs without requiring
   any full header packet exchange on the new link.

3.4.8 Optimized signaling within the Local Coverage Area

   By its very nature, LMM reintroduces triangle routing into the base
   IP layer mobility protocol in that all traffic must go through the
   LMM agent. There is no way to avoid this. The LMM framework SHOULD be
   designed in such a way as to reduce the length of the unwanted
   triangle leg.  The LMM design SHOULD not prohibit optimal placement
   of LMM agents to reduce or eliminate additional triangle routing



Williams                  Expires June 3, 2004                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Localized Mobility Management Goals      December 2003


   introduced by LMM.
   NOTE: It is not required that a LMM scheme specify LMM agents as part
   of its solution.

3.5 Mobility Management Support

   The following LMM requirements pertain to both inter-domain and
   intra-domain hand-off.

3.5.1 No increase of latency or packet loss

   The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the amount of latency or amount
   of packet loss, compared to what exists with the core Mobile IP and
   Mobile IPv6 specification [1] [2]. Indeed, the LMM framework SHOULD
   decrease the amount of latency or amount of packet loss that exists
   with the core mobility protocols.

3.5.2 No increase of service disruption

   The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the amount of service disruption,
   compared to that already exists with the Mobile IP and Mobile IPv6
   core mobility specifications.  Again, the LMM framework SHOULD
   decrease the amount of service disruption that already exists with
   the IP layer mobility management protocols.

3.5.3 No new messages to peer entities

   The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the number of messages between
   the mobile host and the respective peer entities.  The LMM framework
   SHOULD decrease the number of messages between the mobile host and
   the respective peer entities.  With respect to Mobile IP and Mobile
   IPv6, the current number of messages is defined in the Mobile IP core
   mobility specifications [1] [2].

3.6 Auto-configuration capabilities for LMM constituents

   It is desirable that in order to allow for simple incremental
   deployment of an LMM scheme, the local mobility agents MUST require
   minimal (if any) manual configuration. This plug-and-play feature
   could make use of IPv6 auto-configuration mechanisms in the case of
   IPv6, even though most likely other automatic configurations will be
   needed (such as, for example, learning about adjacent LMM agents).
   Auto-configuration also facilitates the network to dynamically adapt
   to general topological changes (whether planned or due to link or
   node failures).

3.7 LMM inter-working with IP routing infrastructure




Williams                  Expires June 3, 2004                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Localized Mobility Management Goals      December 2003


   The LMM framework MUST NOT disrupt core IP routing outside the local
   domain.

3.8 Sparse routing element population

   Any LMM protocol MUST be designed to be geared towards incremental
   deployment capabilities; the latter implies that the LMM scheme
   itself imposes minimum requirements on the carrier's network.
   Incremental deployment capabilities for an LMM protocol signifies
   that an initial set of sparse LMM agents can populate the
   administration domain of a network provider and operate sufficiently.
   In addition, any LMM scheme MUST be compatible with any additional
   deployment of LMM agents in future infrastructure expansions; that is
   to say, allow progressive LMM deployment capabilities.

   It is for this reason that the LMM framework MUST NOT require that
   all routing elements be assumed to be LMM-aware in the signaling
   interactions of an LMM protocol. The LMM framework MUST BE supported,
   at the very minimum, by a sparse (proper subset) LMM agent population
   that is co-located within the routing topology of a single
   administration domain.

3.9 Support for Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 Handover

   Since one of the primary goals of LMM is to minimize signaling during
   handover, an LMM solution MUST be available for the standardized
   Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 handover algorithms. LMM and the Mobile IP
   or Mobile IPv6 handover algorithms MUST maintain compatibility in
   their signaling interactions for fulfilling complementary roles with
   respect to each other.

   This requirement SHOULD NOT be interpreted as ruling out useful
   optimizations of LMM and Mobile IP or Mobile IPv6 handoff schemes
   that simplify the implementation or deployment of LMM or Mobile IP or
   Mobile IPv6 handoff.

3.10 Simple Network design

   LMM SHOULD simplify the network design and provisioning for enabling
   LMM capability in a network and allow progressive LMM deployment
   capabilities.

3.11 Stability

   LMM MUST avoid any forwarding loops.

3.12 Quality of Service requirements




Williams                  Expires June 3, 2004                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    Localized Mobility Management Goals      December 2003


3.12.1 Co-exist with end-to-end QoS

   The LMM MUST have the ability to coexist with QoS schemes to hide the
   mobility of the MN to its peer by avoiding end-to-end QoS signaling.

3.12.2 Co-exist with link-local QoS

   The LMM MUST have the ability to coexist with the QoS schemes to
   facilitate the new provisioning of both uplink and downlink QoS after
   a handoff.

4. Security Considerations

   The usual threats against mobility mechanisms are [9]

      unauthorized redirection traffic, and

      flooding.

   An LMM scheme must cater for suitable authorization or other security
   mechanisms that prevent malicious flooding and other deflection of
   traffic.  When LMM mechanisms are applied only within a single
   administrative domain, solving these issues may be easier than in the
   case of generic end-to-end mobility.  It must be remembered, though,
   that the MNs are not necessarily trusted.  In the general setting, it
   is possible that there are authenticated but malicious MNs that
   attempt to disrupt the service.  The situation is complicated by the
   co-existence of multiple mobility mechanisms, such as Mobile IP and
   LMM.  Since security mechanisms are, in general, non-composable, each
   protocol combination should be analyzed separately.

   Due to administrative constraints, any LMM function should allow for
   any security provisioning to be negotiable or at least
   pre-configurable.  In certain administrative domains, reduced
   security requirements may be allowed, so as to minimise incurred
   overhead.

   Involvement with the LMM function into the security semantics of the
   end-to-end IP mobility signalling between the MN and its peers is
   beyond the functional scope of any LMM protocol.  It is important to
   implement the effect of mobility localisation without interfering
   with security mechanisms between visiting MNs and their peers.  Any
   possibly existing security associations between the MN and its peers
   must be considered transparent for the LMM function.

4.1 Trust model

   By necessity, the MN must trust the LMM agents to provide LMM



Williams                  Expires June 3, 2004                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    Localized Mobility Management Goals      December 2003


   services.  In most settings the MN must probably authenticate the LMM
   agents before it can trust them. Whenever several LMM agents are
   co-operating (as may be the case in fast mobility, for example), the
   agents must trust each other, at least to an extent.  Typically, this
   trust is manifested in the amount of space and resources that the LMM
   agent that is receiving packets from another LMM agent is ready do
   reserve and use.

   The LMM agents should not trust the MNs.  Basically, they must assume
   that the MNs may try to launch various kinds of attacks against them
   or other MNs.  On the other hand, the LMM agents are considered to be
   obliged to provide services to the MNs.  That is, even though the LMM
   agents do not trust the MNs, they must still be willing to provide
   the LMM services to the MNs.

   An LMM protocol may assume that the involved nodes do not trust any
   one else in the network but what has been defined above.  On the
   other hand, it is also possible to assume one or more trusted third
   parties.

4.2 Potential new vulnerabilities

   Beyond the possibility of failure, any LMM agents can also exhibit
   new security vulnerabilities, including the following.

   Denial of service. It is possible that an LMM agent may receive LMM
      messages that incur redundant processing or resource reservation
      at the LMM agent, and as a result, deprive other MNs from LMM
      services.  The LMM function should ensure that malicious nodes are
      excluded from further communications with the LMM agents, in the
      event that their mobility signals are discarded.  Thus, the LMM
      function must cater for denial of service attacks at the LMM agent
      nodes.

   Message replay. Signals that are sent by the MN to a LMM agent can
      also be captured and replayed by malicious nodes towards the LMM
      agents; the LMM agents must ensure that such signalling is either
      authenticated or have a restricted lifetime.  Hence, the LMM
      function must ensure protection from replay attacks at the LMM
      agents.

   Unauthorized creation of LMM state. If an attacker is able to create
      an unauthorized LMM state at an LMM agent, it can effectively
      forward packets to itself, to a black hole, or to a flood victim.
      The LMM agents should make sure that any LMM state is strongly
      linked to a known MN.

   Creation of LMM state before a MN arrives. If an attacker is able to
      anticipate the care-of-address a MN is likely to use on a link,
      and if it can attach to the link using that particular address, it
      can use the address for a while, move away, and request LMM
      services on that address.  Such a request would be authorized
      since the attacker was legally using the very address.  When the
      victim later comes to the link, it will not get any packets since
      its address is forwarded away.  If the care-of-address assignment
      is completed as part of the LMM services, then the LMM system
      should make sure that a new MN cannot acquire a care-of-address
      that has previously been assigned to another MN.  In the case
      where by care-of-address assignment is completed in a manner
      unrelated to the LMM services, then authentication must be
      completed prior to beginning LMM services.

   Unauthorized tearing down of LMM state. If an attacker is able to
      cause an LMM agent to discard its LMM state before requested by
      the MN, the MN may experience loss of service.  Since LMM is
      basically an optimization, this threat may not be so severe and
      may be ignored by an LMM mechanism.


5. Acknowledgments

   Thank you to all who participated in the LMM requirement discussion
   on the Mobile IP working group alias.  First, the editor wishes to
   recognize Theo Pagtzis's work on LMM requirement analysis. Theo has
   contributed significantly to the LMM discussion on the mailing list
   and at IETF working group meetings and has provided text for various
   requirements. Special thanks also to Gabriel Montenegro, John
   Loughney, Alper Yegin, Alberto Lopez Toledo, and Madjid Nakhjiri for
   providing input to the draft in its preliminary stage and many other
   comments they had.  Thanks to the LMM requirement analysis design
   team: Hesham Soliman, Erik Nordmark, Theo Pagtzis, James Kempf, and
   Jari Malinen.  Thanks to Pekka Nikander for changes to make the
   document non-Mobile IP specific and the security considerations. He
   also produced the final xml2rfc format that was used for submitting
   the draft to the RFC Editor.

   Additional comments on the LMM requirements were received from:
   Charlie Perkins, Muhammad Jaseemuddin, Tom Weckstr, Jim Bound, Gopal
   Dommety, Glenn Morrow, Arthur Ross, Samita Chakrabarti, Karim
   El-Malki, Phil Neumiller, Behcet Sarikaya, Karann Chew, Michael

Appendix A. LMM requirements and HMIPv6

   HMIPv6 was evaluated as a localized mobility management protocol, and
   that it was mostly found to satisfy the requirements put forth in
   this document. This section details one exception with some
   explanation.

   Exception:

   One LMM requirement that needs further clarification with respect to
   HMIPv6 is the requirement that states that LMM should not introduce
   additional single points of failure.  The HMIPv6 Mobility Anchor
   Point (MAP) is a new single point of failure. Proposals for HMIPv6
   MAP replication can be optionally incorporated in order to avoid this
   new single point of failure. Such proposals can also be applied to
   the base Mobile IPv6 specification to also allow for Home Agent
   failover as well.
