Internet-Draft       6in4 versus 6over4 terminology         October 2005


1.  Introduction

   A number of IETF documents have used in an "interchangeable" way
   several expressions such as:

   o  6in4

   o  6-in-4

   o  IPv6-in-IPv4

   o  IPv6 in IPv4

   o  6over4

   o  6-over-4

   o  IPv6-over-IPv4

   o  IPv6 over IPv4

   o  4in6

   o  4-in-6

   o  IPv4-in-IPv6

   o  IPv4 in IPv6

   o  4over6

   o  4-over-6

   o  IPv4-over-IPv6

   o  IPv4 over IPv6

   Note that this list is not exhaustive and many other similar
   expressions may be also in use.  For example, in some situations
   other encapsulating layers are used (i.e., 6/UDP/4), and similar
   expressions are being used.

   As a consequence, documents from vendors, product manuals,
   publications, papers, books, tutorials, training material and many
   others, use also those expressions.

   However not all those documents, including the IETF ones, are
   actually referring to the same IPv6/IPv4 encapsulations or IPv4/IPv6

   transition mechanisms.

   The result of this terminology confusion is a number of errors among
   vendors, operators, engineers and users when designing and
   documenting products, or when setting up transition mechanisms,
   creating at the end unnecessary operational costs, specially for
   beginners which try to setup IPv6 for their first occasions.


2.  Definition of 'in' and 'over'

   IP in IP Tunneling was defined by [1].  Afterwards [2], obsoleted by
   [3], defines the basic IPv4/IPv6 transition mechanisms, including the
   encapsulation of IPv6 packets in IPv4 ones (by means of protocol 41);
   this document is being updated as "ietf-v6ops-mech-v2".

   Similarly, [4], defines the encapsulation of IPv4 packets in IPv6
   ones.

   A first conclusion can be extracted from this documents (even if some
   of them actually use, some times, "over"): Those encapsulation
   mechanisms are the ones that should use the "in" terminology.  Note
   that they are just encapsulation mechanisms, which often are used by
   several transition mechanisms.

   Furthermore, [5] specify a transition mechanism, which uses 6in4
   (encapsulation of IPv6 packets in IPv4 ones), creating a virtual IPv6
   link over an IPv4 multicast infrastructure.  This transition
   mechanism is named as "6over4".

   Clearly, "6in4" and "6over4" are quite different things, actually
   6over4 is a transition mechanism which uses 6in4 as the procedure for
   encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 multicast infrastructures.

   The fact that they are different things and specially the requirement
   for a (IPv4) multicast infrastructure for 6over4, makes necessary to
   clarify the difference and avoid confusions among both.

   Engineers operating networks and their customers (for example when
   setting up tunnels), often do not read all the IETF documents, so
   they could easily misunderstand if a tunnel is "6over4" or "6in4"
   (specially when vendor documents use both terms to actually name
   "6in4", possibly because the misusage of those terms in [2], [3]),
   and this creates some extra troubleshooting time and confusion.


3.  Conclusions and Future Consistency

   In order to avoid this kind of confusion, it should be understood the
   difference between 6over4 and 6in4 (and any other equivalent
   terminologies), and future documents (including IETF ones) must take
   this in consideration when republished.

   Moreover, new documents which describe other encapsulations and
   protocols, such as IPv4 in IPv6, IPv6 in UDP/IPv4, IPv6 in IPv6, must
   also use, for consistency reasons, "in" instead of "over".

   It is recommended that any existing documents are amended ASAP to
   avoid the existing confusion.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have any protocol-related security
   considerations.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any specific IANA considerations.
