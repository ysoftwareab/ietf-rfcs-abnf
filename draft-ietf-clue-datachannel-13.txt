   negotiation mechanism [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].  This
   includes SCTP considerations specific to a CLUE data channel, the SDP
   Media Description (m- line) values, and usage of SDP attributes
   specific to a CLUE data channel.

   Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP
   Offer/Answer [RFC3264] procedures for negotiating usage of a CLUE
   data channel, are outside the scope of this document.

   NOTE: The usage of the data channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP)
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] for establishing a CLUE data channel
   is outside the scope of this document.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   SCTPoDTLS association refers to an SCTP association carried over an
   DTLS connection [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].

   WebRTC data channel refers to a pair of SCTP streams over a SCTPoDTLS
   association that is used to transport non-media data between two
   entities, as defined in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   CLUE data channel refers to a WebRTC data channel
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] realization, with a specific set of
   SCTP characteristics, with the purpose of transporting CLUE protocol
   [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol] messages between two CLUE entities.

   CLUE entity refers to a SIP User Agent (UA) [RFC3261] that supports
   the CLUE data channel and the CLUE protocol.

   CLUE session refers to a SIP session [RFC3261] between two SIP UAs,
   where a CLUE data channel, associated with the SIP session, has been
   established between the SIP UAs.

   SCTP stream is defined in [RFC4960] as a unidirectional logical
   channel established from one to another associated SCTP endpoint,
   within which all user messages are delivered in sequence except for
   those submitted to the unordered delivery service.

   SCTP identifier is defined in [RFC4960] as an unsigned integer, which
   identifies an SCTP stream.

3.  CLUE data channel

3.1.  General

   This section describes the realization of a CLUE data channel, using
   the WebRTC data channel mechanism.  This includes a set of SCTP
   characteristics specific to a CLUE data channel, the values of the m-
   line describing the SCTPoDTLS association associated with the WebRTC
   data channel, and the usage of the SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data
   channel negotiation mechanism for creating the CLUE data channel.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the SCTP streams
   realizing a WebRTC data channel must be associated with the same SCTP
   association.  In addition, both SCTP streams realizing the WebRTC
   data channel must use the same SCTP stream identifier value.  These
   rules also apply to a CLUE data channel.

   Within a given CLUE session, a CLUE entity MUST use a single CLUE
   data channel for transport of all CLUE messages towards its peer.

3.2.  SCTP Considerations

3.2.1.  General

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], different SCTP
   options (e.g. regarding ordered delivery ), can be used for a data
   channel.  This section describes the SCTP options used for a CLUE
   data channel.  Section 3.3 describes how SCTP options are signalled
   using SDP.

   NOTE: While SCTP allows SCTP options to be applied per SCTP message,
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] mandates that, for a given data
   channel, the same SCTP options are applied to each SCTP message
   associated with that data channel.

3.2.2.  SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID)

   A CLUE entity MUST use the PPID value 51 when sending a CLUE message
   on a CLUE data channel.

   NOTE: As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the PPID value
   51 indicates that the SCTP message contains data encoded in a UTF-8
   format.  The PPID value 51 does not indicate what application
   protocol the SCTP message is associated with, only the format in
   which the data is encoded.

Internet-Draft              CLUE data channel                  June 2016


3.2.3.  Reliability

   The usage of SCTP for the CLUE data channel ensures reliable
   transport of CLUE protocol [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol] messages.

   A CLUE entity MUST NOT use the partial reliability or limited
   retransmission SCTP extensions, described in [RFC3758], for the CLUE
   data channel.

   NOTE: [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] requires the support of the
   partial reliability extension defined in [RFC3758].  This is not
   needed for a CLUE data channel, as messages are required to always be
   sent reliably.  [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] also mandates support
   of the limited retransmission policy defined in [RFC7496].

3.2.4.  Order

   A CLUE entity MUST use the ordered delivery SCTP service, as
   described in [RFC4960], for the CLUE data channel.

3.2.5.  Stream Reset

   A CLUE entity MUST support the stream reset extension defined in
   [RFC6525].

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the dynamic address
   reconfiguration extension ('Supported Extensions Parameter'
   parameter) defined in [RFC5061] must be used to signal the support of
   the stream reset extension defined in [RFC6525].  Other features of
   [RFC5061] MUST NOT be used for CLUE data channels.

3.2.6.  SCTP Multihoming

   SCTP multi-homing is not supported for SCTPoDTLS associations, and
   can therefore not be used for a CLUE data channel.

3.2.7.  Close CLUE data channel

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol], in order to close a
   data channel, an entity sends an SCTP reset message [RFC6525] on its
   outgoing SCTP stream associated with the data channel.  When the
   remote peer receives the reset message, it also sends (unless already
   sent) a reset message on its outgoing SCTP stream associated with the
   data channel.  The SCTPoDTLS association, and other data channels
   established on the same association, are not affected by the SCTP
   reset messages.

3.3.  SDP Considerations

3.3.1.  General

   This section defines how to construct the SDP Media Description (m-
   line) for describing the SCTPoDTLS association used to realize a CLUE
   data channel.  The section also defines how to use the SDP-based
   "SCTP over DTLS" data channel negotiation mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] for establishing a CLUE data
   channel on the SCTPoDTLS association.

   NOTE: Other protocols than SDP for negotiating usage of an SCTPoDTLS
   association for realizing a CLUE data channel are outside the scope
   of this specification.

   [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling] describes the SDP Offer/Answer procedures
   for negotiating a CLUE session, including the CLUE controlled media
   streams and the CLUE data channel.

3.3.1.1.  SDP Media Description Fields

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp], the field values of an m-
   line describing an SCTPoDTLS association are set as following:

   +---------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+
   |     media     |     port     |      proto      |       fmt        |
   +---------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+
   | "application" |   UDP port   | "UDP/DTLS/SCTP" |   application    |
   |               |    value     |                 |      usage       |
   | "application" |   TCP port   | "TCP/DTLS/SCTP" |   application    |
   |               |    value     |                 |      usage       |
   +---------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+

                     Table 1: SDP "proto" field values

   CLUE entities SHOULD NOT transport the SCTPoDTLS association used to
   realize the CLUE data channel over TCP (using the "TCP/DTLS/SCTP"
   proto value), unless it is known that UDP/DTLS/SCTP will not work
   (for instance, when the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
   mechanism [RFC5245] is used and the ICE procedures determine that TCP
   transport is required).

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp], when the SCTPoDTLS
   association is used to realize a WebRTC data channel, the value of
   the application usage part is 'webrtc-datachannel'.

3.3.1.2.  SDP sctp-port Attribute

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp], the SDP sctp-port attribute
   value is set to the SCTP port of the SCTPoDTLS association.  A CLUE
   entity can choose any valid SCTP port value.

3.3.2.  SDP dcmap Attribute

   The values of the SDP dcmap attribute
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg], associated with the m- line
   describing the SCTPoDTLS association used to realize the WebRTC data
   channel, are set as following:

   +----------+------------+------------+--------+----------+----------+
   | stream-  | subprotoco |   label    | ordere | max-retr | max-time |
   |    id    |     l      |            |   d    |          |          |
   +----------+------------+------------+--------+----------+----------+
   | Value of |   "CLUE"   | Applicatio | "true" |   N/A    |   N/A    |
   | the SCTP |            | n specific |        |          |          |
   |  stream  |            |            |        |          |          |
   | used to  |            |            |        |          |          |
   | realize  |            |            |        |          |          |
   | the CLUE |            |            |        |          |          |
   |   data   |            |            |        |          |          |
   | channel  |            |            |        |          |          |
   +----------+------------+------------+--------+----------+----------+

                    Table 2: SDP dcmap attribute values

   NOTE: As CLUE entities are required to use ordered SCTP message
   delivery, with full reliability, according to the procedures in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] the max-retr and max-time
   attribute parameters are not used when negotiating CLUE data
   channels.

3.3.3.  SDP dcsa Attribute

   The SDP dcsa attribute [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] is not
   used when establishing a CLUE data channel.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification relies on the security properties of the WebRTC
   data channel described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], including
   reliance on DTLS.  Since CLUE sessions are established using SIP/SDP,
   protecting the data channel against message modification and recovery
   requires the use of SIP authentication and authorization mechanisms
   described in [RFC3261] for session establishment prior to
   establishing the data channel.

Internet-Draft              CLUE data channel                  June 2016


   Changes from draft-holmberg-clue-datachannel-04

   o  Draft submitted as draft-ietf-clue-data-channel-00.
   o  Editorial nits fixed.
   o  Changes based on comments from Paul Kyzivat (http://www.ietf.org/
      mail-archive/web/clue/current/msg03559.html).
   o  - Proto value fixed.
   o  - Explicit text that the partial reliability and limited
      retransmission policies MUST NOT be used.
   o  - Added open issue on whether the DCEP 'protocol' field value for
      CLUE should contain a version number.
   o  - Removed paragraph saying that an offerer must not insert more
      than one m- line describing an SCTPoDTLS association to be used to
      realize a CLUE data channel, as the draft already states that only
      one CLUE data channel per CLUE session shall be opened.
   o  - Added reference to draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol regarding
      details on reseting SCTP streams.
   o  - Added text saying that the value of the DCEP 'channel type' MUST
      be DATA_CHANNEL_RELIABLE.
   o  - Clarified that DCEP must be supported, and used in the absence
      of another mechanism for opening a CLUE data channel.

   Changes from draft-holmberg-clue-datachannel-03

   o  Procedures updated, based on WG agreement (IETF#89) to use DCEP
      for the CLUE data channel.
   o  Procedures updated, based on WG agreement (IETF#89) that offerer
      is responsible for sending DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_OPEN.
   o  Editorial changes, and alignments caused by changes in referenced
      specifications.

   Changes from draft-holmberg-clue-datachannel-02

   o  PPID value for CLUE messages added
   o  References updated

   Changes from draft-holmberg-clue-datachannel-01

   o  More text added

   Changes from draft-holmberg-clue-datachannel-00
