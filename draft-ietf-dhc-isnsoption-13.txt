DHCP Option Number for iSNS Revision 13                  November 2004 

Abstract 

   This document describes the DHCP option to allow Internet Storage 
   Name Service (iSNS) clients to automatically discover the location 
   of the iSNS server through the use of DHCP for IPv4. iSNS provides 
   discovery and management capabilities for Internet SCSI (iSCSI) and 
   Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) storage devices in an 
   enterprise-scale IP storage network.  iSNS provides intelligent 
   storage management services comparable to those found in Fibre 
   Channel networks, allowing a commodity IP network to function in a 
   similar capacity as a storage area network. 

Conventions used in this document 

   iSNS refers to the Internet Storage Name Service framework 
   consisting of the storage network model and associated services. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

   All frame formats are in big endian network byte order.  RESERVED 
   fields SHOULD be set to zero. 

   This document uses the following terms: 

   "iSNS Client" - iSNS clients are processes resident in iSCSI and 
   iFCP devices that initiate transactions with the iSNS server using 
   the iSNS Protocol. 

   "iSNS Server" - The iSNS server responds to iSNS protocol query and 
   registration messages, and initiates asynchronous notification 
   messages.  The iSNS server stores information registered by iSNS 
   clients. 

   "iSCSI (Internet SCSI)" - iSCSI is an encapsulation of SCSI for a 
   new generation of storage devices interconnected with TCP/IP. 

   "iFCP (Internet Fibre Channel Protocol)" - iFCP is a gateway-to-
   gateway protocol designed to interconnect existing Fibre Channel 
   devices using TCP/IP.  iFCP maps the Fibre Channel transport and 
   fabric services to TCP/IP. 

1.       Introduction 

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 provides a 
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts.  Its 
   usefulness extends to hosts and devices using the iSCSI and iFCP 
   protocols to connect to block level storage assets over a TCP/IP 
   network.

DHCP Option Number for iSNS Revision 13                  November 2004 

   The iSNS Protocol provides a framework for automated discovery, 
   management, and configuration of iSCSI and iFCP devices on a TCP/IP 
   network.  It provides functionality similar to that found on Fibre 
   Channel networks, except that iSNS works within the context of an IP 
   network.  iSNS thereby provides the requisite storage intelligence 
   to IP networks that are standard on existing Fibre Channel networks. 

   Existing DHCP options cannot be used to find iSNS servers for the 
   following reasons: 

    a) iSNS functionality is distinctly different from other protocols 
       using DHCP options.  Specifically, iSNS provides a significant 
       superset of capabilities compared to typical name resolution 
       protocols such as DNS.  It is designed to support client devices 
       that allow themselves to be configured and managed from a 
       central iSNS server 

    b) iSNS requires a DHCP option format that provides more than the 
       location of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option needs to specify 
       the subset of iSNS services that may be actively used by the 
       iSNS client. 

   The DHCP option number for iSNS is used by iSCSI and iFCP devices to 
   discover the location and role of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option 

   number assigned for iSNS by IANA is <<TBD>>.  

2.       iSNS Option for DHCP 

   This option specifies the location of the primary and backup iSNS 
   servers and the iSNS services available to an iSNS client.

   Length: the number of bytes that follow the Length field. 

   iSNS Functions: A bitmapped field defining the functions supported 
           by the iSNS servers.  The format of this field is described 
           in section 2.1. 

   Discovery Domain Access: A bit field indicating the types of iSNS 
           clients that are allowed to modify Discovery Domains. The 
           field contents are described in section 2.2. 

   Administrative Flags field: Contains the administrative settings for 
           the iSNS servers discovered through the DHCP query.  The 
           contents of this field are described in section 2.3. 

   iSNS Server Security Bitmap: Contains the iSNS server security 
           settings specified in section 2.4. 

   a1...a4: Depending on the setting of the Heartbeat bit in the 
           Administrative Flags field (see section 2.3), this field 
           contains either the IP address from which the iSNS heartbeat 
           originates (see [ISNS]) or the IP address of the primary 
           iSNS server. 

   b1...b4: Depending on the setting of Heartbeat bit in the 
           Administrative Flags field (see section 2.3), this field 
           contains either the IP address of the primary iSNS server or 
           a secondary iSNS server. 

   Additional Secondary iSNS Servers: Each set of four octets specifies 
           the IP address of a secondary iSNS server. 

   The Code field through IP address field a1...a4 MUST be present in 
   every response to the iSNS query, hence the Length field has a 
   minimum value of 14. 

   If the Heartbeat bit is set in the Administrative Flags field (see 
   section 2.3), then b1...b4 MUST also be present. In this case, the 
   minimum value of the Length field is 18. 

   The inclusion of Additional Secondary iSNS Servers in the response 
   MUST be indicated by increasing the Length field accordingly. 

2.1      iSNS Functions Field 

   The iSNS Functions Field defines the iSNS server's operational role 
   (i.e., how the iSNS server is to be used).  The iSNS server's role 
   can be as basic as providing simple discovery information, or as 
   significant as providing IKE/IPSec security policies and 
   certificates for the use of iSCSI and iFCP devices. The format of 
   the iSNS Functions field is shown in Figure 2:

                            Function fields are valid.  If set to zero,

                            Function fields MUST be ignored. 

           DD-based        Indicates whether or not devices in a 
           Authorization:  common Discovery Domain (DD) are implicitly 
                            authorized to access one another. Although 
                            Discovery Domains control the scope of 
                            device discovery, they do not necessarily 
                            indicate whether or not a domain member is 
                            authorized to access discovered devices.  
                            If this bit is set to one, then devices in 
                            a common Discovery Domain are automatically 
                            allowed access to each other (if 
                            successfully authenticated).  If this bit 
                            is set to zero, then access authorization 
                            is not implied by domain membership and 
                            must be explicitly performed by each 
                            device. In either case, devices not in a 
                            common discovery domain are not allowed to 
                            access each other. 

           Security Policy Indicates whether the iSNS client is to 
           Distribution:   download and use the security policy 
                            configuration stored in the iSNS server.  
                            If set to one, then the policy is stored in 
                            the iSNS server and must be used by the 
                            iSNS client for its own security policy.  
                            If set to zero, then the iSNS client must 
                            obtain its security policy configuration by 
                            other means.

                              iSNS heartbeat message is sent.  If set 
                              to one, then a1-a4 contains the 
                              heartbeat multicast address and b1-b4 
                              contains the IP address of the primary 
                              iSNS server, followed by the IP 
                              address(es) of any backup servers (see 
                              Figure 1).  If set to zero, then a1-a4 
                              contains the IP address of the primary 
                              iSNS server, followed by the IP 
                              address(es) of any backup servers. 

           Management SCNs:   Indicates whether control nodes are 
                              authorized to register to receive 
                              Management State Change Notifications

                              (SCN's).  Management SCN's are a special 
                              class of State Change Notification whose 
                              scope is the entire iSNS database.  If 
                              set to one, then control nodes are 
                              authorized to register to receive 
                              Management SCN's.  If set to zero, then 
                              control nodes are not authorized to 
                              receive Management SCN's (although they 
                              may receive normal SCN's). 

           Default Discovery  Indicates whether a newly registered 
           Domain:            device that is not explicitly placed 
                              into a Discovery Domain (DD) and 
                              Discovery Domain Set (DDS) should be 
                              automatically placed into a default DD 
                              and DDS.  If set to one, then a default 
                              DD shall contain all devices in the iSNS 
                              database that have not been explicitly 
                              placed into a DD by an iSNS client.  If 
                              set to zero, then devices not explicitly 
                              placed into a DD are not members of any 
                              DD.

           Enabled          This bit specifies the validity of the 
                             remainder of the iSNS server security 
                             bitmap.  If set to one, then the contents 
                             of the remainder of the field are valid.  
                             If set to zero, then the contents of the 
                             rest of the field are undefined and MUST 
                             be ignored. 

           IKE/IPSec        1 = IKE/IPSec enabled; 0 = IKE/IPSec 
                             disabled. 

           Main Mode        1 = Main Mode enabled; 0 = Main Mode 
                             disabled. 

           Aggressive Mode  1 = Aggressive mode enabled; 0 = 
                             Aggressive mode disabled. 

           PFS              1 = PFS enabled; 0 = PFS disabled. 

           Transport Mode   1 = Transport mode preferred; 0 = No 
                             preference. 


           Tunnel Mode      1 = Tunnel mode preferred; 0 = No 
                             preference. 

    

   If IKE/IPSec is disabled, this indicates that the Internet Key 
   Exchange (IKE) Protocol is not available to configure IPSec keys for 
   iSNS sessions to this iSNS server.  It does not necessarily preclude 
   other key exchange methods (e.g., manual keying) from establishing 
   an IPSec security association for the iSNS session. 

   If IKE/IPsec is enabled, then for each of the bit pairs
   <Main Mode, Aggressive Mode> and <Transport Mode, Tunnel Mode>,
   one of the two bits MUST be set to 1 and the other bit
   MUST be set to 0.
 

3.       Security Considerations 

   The DHCP Authentication security option as specified in [RFC3118] 
   to protect the iSNS option may present a problem due to the limited 
   implementation and deployment of the DHCP authentication option.  
   The IPsec security mechanisms for iSNS itself are specified in 
   [iSNS] to provide confidentiality when sensitive information is 
   distributed via iSNS. See the Security Considerations section of 
   [iSNS] for details and specific requirements for implementation of 
   IPsec. 

   In addition, [iSNS] describes an authentication block that provides 
   message integrity for multicast or broadcast iSNS messages (i.e. for 
 
Monia, et-al               Standards Track                  [Page 10]  

DHCP Option Number for iSNS Revision 13                      November 2004 

   heartbeat/discovery messages only). See [RFC 3723] for further 
   discussion of security for these protocols. 

   If no sensitive information, as described in [iSNS], is being 
   distributed via iSNS, and an Entity is discovered via iSNS, 
   authentication and authorization are handled by the IP Storage 
   protocols whose endpoints are discovered via iSNS, specifically iFCP 
   [iFCP] and iSCSI [RFC 3720]. It is the responsibility of the 
   providers  of  these  services  to  ensure  that an inappropriately 
   advertised or discovered service does not compromise their security. 

   When no DHCP security is used, there is a risk of distribution of
   false discovery information (e.g., via the iSNS DHCP option
   identifying a false iSNS server that distributes the false
   discovery information).  The primary countermeasure for this risk
   is authentication by the IP storage protocols discovered through
   iSNS. When this risk is a significant concern, IPsec SAs SHOULD be
   used (as specified in RFC 3723). For example, if an attacker uses
   DHCP and iSNS to distribute discovery information that falsely
   identifies an iSCSI endpoint, that endpoint will lack the
   credentials necessary to successfully complete IKE authentication,
   and hence will be prevented from falsely sending or receiving iSCSI
   traffic. When this risk of false discovery information is a
   significant concern and IPsec is implemented for iSNS, IPsec SAs
   SHOULD also be used for iSNS traffic to prevent use of a false iSNS
   server; this is more robust than relying only on the IP Storage
   protocols to detect false discovery information.

   When IPsec is implemented for iSNS, there is a risk of a denial of
   service attack based on repeated use of false discovery information
   that will cause initiation of IKE negotiation. The countermeasures
   for this are administrative configuration of each iSNS Entity to
   limit the peers that it is willing to communicate with (i.e., by IP
   address range and/or DNS domain), and maintenance of a negative
   authentication cache to avoid repeatedly contacting an iSNS Entity
   that fails to authenticate. These three measures (i.e., IP address
   range limits, DNS domain limits, negative authentication cache)
   MUST be implemented for iSNS entities when this DHCP option is
   used.  An analogous argument applies to the IP storage protocols
   that can be discovered via iSNS as discussed in RFC 3723.

    In addition, use of the techniques described in [RFC2827] and
    [RFC3833] may also be relevant to reduce denial of service attacks.



    

4.       IANA Considerations 

   In accordance with the policy defined in [DHCP], IANA has assigned a 
   value of TBD for this option.

DHCP Option Number for iSNS Revision 13                  November 2004 

   There are no other IANA-assigned values defined by this 
   specification.
