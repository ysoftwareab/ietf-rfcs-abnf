Abstract

   SEAL is related to problem spaces currently under investigation in
   the IRTF Routing Research Group, as well as the IETF INTAREA general
   area and IETF AUTOCONF and MANET working groups.  SEAL addresses
   packet size issues for IP-in-IP tunnels, with improved duplicate
   packet detection as an additional benefit.  This document is
   currently under construction as an individual submission, to be
   followed by determination of an appropriate working group (or remain
   as individual sub).
