Internet-Draft               DNS URL scheme                    June 2001


1. Introduction and Background

   DNS [1][2] is a widely deployed protocol used to, among other
   things, translate domain names into IP addresses.  More recent work
   has added support for storing cryptographic keys and certificates in
   DNS [6][7].  To be able to locate, for example, certificates via a
   network resource, URLs are often used.  This document describe a URL
   scheme to locate DNS information.  The DNS URL scheme described here
   can be used to reference any DNS data, not only certificates.  The
   format of data located is described in [8].

   This following sections are modelled after the URL Registration
   Template in [9].

2. URL Scheme

   The name of the URL scheme defined in this document is "dns".

   A DNS URL designates a DNS resource record; by domain name, type and
   class and optionally server.  The DNS URL follows the generic syntax
   from RFC 2396 [5], and is described using ABNF [4] in section 3.

   A DNS URL is of the following general form.  This is intended to
   illustrate, not define, the scheme.

   dns:[//server/]domain[?type=TYPE;class=CLASS]

3. URL Scheme Syntax

   Strings are not case sensitive and free insertion of
   linear-white-space is not permitted.

   dnsurl       = "dns:" [ "//" hostport "/" ] hostname ["?" query]
                                ; See RFC 2396 for "hostport" and
                                ; "hostname" definitions

   query        = queryelement [";" query]

   queryelement = ( "CLASS=" classval ) | ( "TYPE=" typeval ) |
                  ( 1*alphanum "=" 1*alphanum )

   classval     = 1*digit / "IN" / "CH" / ...
                                ; Any standard DNS class expressed as
                                ; mnemonic or as decimal integer

   typeval      = 1*digit / "A" / "NS" / "MD" / ...
                                ; Any standard DNS type expressed as
                                ; mnemonic or as decimal integer

   The digit representation of types and classes SHOULD NOT be used
   when a defined mnemonic for the corresponding value is known.

   Unless specified, the "server" is assumed to be locally
   (pre-)configured, and "class" to be the Internet class ("IN"), and
   "type" to be the Address (A) type.

4. Character Encoding Considerations

   Since 8-bit characters are not permitted in URLs, they must be
   encoded as per the "URI Generic Syntax" RFC.  DNS domains has been
   historically restricted to a subset of the US ASCII alphabet, but
   recent work within the IETF IDN working group is likely to change
   this restriction.  Since this specification re-uses the "hostport"
   definition from the URI specification [5], a possible future update
   of the "hostport" definition within the URL specifications might be
   sufficient to adapt DNS URLs to IDNs.

5. Intended Usage

   Broad usage.  The application/dns or text/dns MIME types are
   associated with this URL scheme [10].

6. Applications and/or Protocols Using This Scheme

   E.g. CNRP.

7. Interoperability Considerations

   The data referenced by this URL scheme might be transfered by
   protocols that aren't MIME aware (such as the DNS protocol). This is
   not anticipated to have any serious interoperability impact though.

8. Security Considerations

   A DNS URL does not embed confidential information.  If it references
   domains in the Internet DNS environment, even the information
   references by the URL is public information.  If a DNS URL is used
   within a "internal" DNS environment, the same security
   considerations of the DNS environment apply to the use and handling
   of DNS URLs themselves as well as the data returned by looking up
   these URLs.

   If security related information is referenced by DNS URLs (such as
   certificates stored in DNS), care must be taken to prevent for
   man-in-the-middle attacks that malicously replace the certificate. 
   Techniques such as Secure DNS may be used.

   This draft does not affect the security considerations related to

   DNS itself.

9. IANA Considerations

   The IANA is asked to register the DNS URL scheme using this document
   as the template in accordance with RFC 2717 [9].

10. Examples

   This illustrate a DNS query for "www.example.org" for the Internet
   (IN) class and the Address (A) type:

   dns:www.example.org;class=IN;type=A

   This illustrate a DNS query for "simon.example.org" for the CERT
   type in the Internet (IN) class:

   dns:simon.example.org;type=CERT

   This illustrate a DNS query for "ftp.example.org" from the DNS
   server "internal-dns.example.org" server, and the address type:

   dns://internal-dns.example.org/ftp.example.org;type=A
