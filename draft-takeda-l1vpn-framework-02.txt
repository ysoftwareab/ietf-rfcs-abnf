Abstract

   This document provides a framework for Layer 1 Virtual Private
   Networks (L1VPNs). This framework is intended to aid in developing
   and standardizing protocols and mechanisms to support interoperable
   L1VPNs.

   The document examines motivations for L1VPNs, high level (service
   level) requirements, and outlines some of the architectural models
   that might be used to build L1VPNs.

0.1. Summary

   This document describes a framework for Layer 1 VPNs (L1VPNs).

   L1VPNs provide services over layer 1 networks, such as WDM and TDM
   networks. This document provides a framework for L1VPNs and the
   realization of the framework by those networks being controlled by
   GMPLS protocols.

0.2. Where does it fit in the picture of the IETF Work

   Services may be provisioned across layer 1 networks using
   GMPLS protocols. L1VPNs may be managed and operated using these
   protocols as described in this document. GMPLS protocols were
   developed within the IETF using IP addressing and based on IP and
   other Internet protocols. The IETF continues to work with GMPLS
   protocols, enhancing them and applying them to new requirements.

   VPN related work areas might also have points of interaction with the
   content of this document.

0.3. Justification

   This document exists to demonstrate the service level requirements
   for L1VPNs and to create a framework for L1VPNs within the existing
   Internet architectures. As such, this document is the justification
   for better understanding of L1VPNs within the IETF.

   Study Group 13 of the ITU-T has been investigating the service level
   requirements for L1VPNs with input from major network service
   providers and equipment vendors. There is a strong feeling within
   SG13 that the desirability of L1VPN services is growing and that
   there is a need for a minimum set of common approaches that will
   lead to interoperable solutions.

0.4. Related Internet Documents

   Much of the background work for this document has been directly
   developed within the ITU-T and is presented as [Y.1312] and
   [Y.1313]. However, some Internet drafts are related to this topic
   and the following three ones are relevant ones.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in
   [RFC3031], [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [GMPLS-ROUTING] and
   [PPVPN-TERM].

   In addition, following new terms are used within this document.

   - Virtual link: A provider network TE link provided to customers in
     routing information for purposes which include path computation. A
     physical link may or may not exist between two end points of a
     virtual link.

   - Virtual node: A provider network logical node provided to customers
     in routing information. A virtual node may represent a single
     physical node or multiple physical nodes and links.

   - VPN end point: CE's data plane interface, connected to a PE device,
     which is part of the VPN membership. Note, a data plane interface
     is the transmission unit associated with a connection, and includes
     a channel in a channelized interface.

   - VPN connection (or connection in L1VPN context): A connection
     between a pair of VPN end points. In some scenarios, A VPN
     connection may be established between a pair of Cs (customer
     devices).

3. Introduction

   The document examines motivations for Layer 1 Virtual Private
   Networks (L1VPNs), provides high level (service level) requirements,
   and outlines some of the architectural models that might be used to
   build L1VPNs.

   The objective of the document is mainly to present the requirements
   and architecture work in this field that has been undertaken within
   the ITU-T.

   L1VPNs provide services over layer 1 networks. This document provides
   a framework for L1VPNs and the realization of the framework by those
   networks being controlled by GMPLS protocols.

3.1 Overview

3.1.1 Network Topology

   The layer 1 network, made of Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs) or Time
   Division Multiplex (TDM) capable switches, may be seen as consisting
   of provider edge (PE) devices that give access from outside of the
   network, and provider (P) devices that operate only within the core
   of the network. Similarly, outside the layer 1 network is the
   customer network consisting of customer (C) devices with access to
   the layer 1 network made through customer edge (CE) devices.

   A CE and PE are connected by one or more links. A CE may also be
   connected to more than one PE, and a PE may have more than one CE
   connected to it.

3.1.2 Introducing Layer 1 VPNs

   The concept of a provider provisioned VPN (PPVPN) has been
   established through many previous documents such as [L2VPN-FRAME] and


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires April 2005               [Page 5]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


   [L3VPN-FRAME]. Terminology for PPVPNs is set out in [PPVPN-TERM] with
   special reference to layer 2 and layer 3 VPNs.

   The realization of Layer 1 VPNs (L1VPNs) can be based on extensions
   of the concepts of the PPVPN to the layer 1 network. It must be
   understood that meeting the requirements set out in this document may
   necessitate modifications to the existing mechanisms both for the
   control plane within the layer 1 network and for service provisioning
   at the edge of the network (CE and PE devices). It is at the
   interface between CE and PE devices that the L1VPN service is
   provided.

3.1.3 Current Technologies for Dynamic Layer 1 Provisioning

   Pre-existing efforts at standardization have focused on the provision
   of dynamic connections within the layer 1 network (signaling and
   routing), and the interfaces for requesting services between the CE
   and PE or between PEs at network boundaries (UNI and E-NNI
   respectively).

   No change in principle would be required to the operation within the
   network, and the E-NNI is not in scope for current L1VPN
   considerations. But the UNI is very relevant since it is a means by
   which the CE can make service requests to the PE to establish
   services (that is, connections) across the layer 1 network to remote
   CEs.

   Current UNIs include features to facilitate requests for end-to-end
   (that is, CE to CE) service requests that include the specification
   of constraints such as explicit paths, bandwidth requirements,
   protection needs, and (of course) destinations.

   The UNIs, however, do not provide a sufficiently high level of
   service to support VPNs without some additions. For example, there is
   no way to distinguish between control messages received over a shared
   control link (i.e., a control link shared by multiple VPNs) at a UNI,
   and these messages must be disambiguated with respect to the L1VPN to
   which they apply.

   Further, there is currently no leakage of routing information across
   the PE to CE boundary. While this restriction may be considered
   desirable from the perspective of network separation, VPN operation
   may benefit from the dynamic exchange of routing information
   between CEs that provide access to the VPNs.

   In order that L1VPNs can be supported in a fully functional manner,
   these deficiencies and other requirements set out later in this
   document must be addressed.

3.2 Relationship with ITU-T

   This document is based on the work of the ITU-T Study Group 13
   Question 11. This group has been researching and specifying both the
   requirements and the architecture of L1VPNs for some time. In this
   context, this document is a representation of the findings of the
   ITU-T, and a presentation of those findings in terms and format that
   are familiar to the IETF.

   In particular, this document is limited to the areas of concern of
   the IETF. That is, it is limited to layer 1 networks that utilize
   IP as the underlying support for their control plane.

   The intention of this document is to present the requirements and
   architectures developed within the ITU-T to the IETF for better
   understanding and further cooperation between the two bodies.

   Some work related to L1VPN solution space has already been done
   within the IETF. This document intends to set a framework of
   requirements and architectures into which all possible solutions can
   fit.

4. Motivations

   In this discussion many merits and motivations may be taken for
   granted.

   The general benefits and desirability of VPNs has been described
   many times and in many places. This document does not dwell on the
   merits of VPNs as such, but focuses entirely on the applicability
   of the VPN concept to layer 1 networks.

   Similarly, the utility and value of a control plane for the
   configuration, management and operation of a layer 1 network is
   well-rehearsed.

4.1 Basic Layer 1 Services

   Basic layer 1 services may be characterized in terms that include:

   - Connectivity: Between a pair of CEs.
   - Capacity: For example, the bit rate for a TDM service or the
     capacity of a lambda.
   - Transparency: For example, for an SDH network, overhead
     transparency.
   - Availability: The percentage of time that the offered service
     meets the agreed criteria. To achieve the required level of
     availability for the customer connections the service provider's
     network may use restoration or protected resources.


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires April 2005               [Page 7]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


   - Performance: The quality of the service delivered to customers,
     e.g., the number of error-seconds per month.

   The layer 1 services may be categorized based on the combination of
   connectivity features (data plane) and service control capability
   features (control plane) available to the customer. A CE is
   associated with the service interface between a customer site and the
   network, and the categorization can be seen in the context of this
   service interface as follows.

   1. A single connection between a pair of CEs.

      - Static Service
        The classic private line service achieved through a permanent
        connection.

      - Dynamic Service
        Either a switched connection service, or a customer-controlled
        soft permanent connection service

   2. Multiple connections among a set of CEs.

      - Static Service
        A private network service consisting of a mesh of permanent
        connections.

      - Dynamic Service
        A dynamic private network service consisting of any combination
        of switched connection services and customer-controlled soft
        permanent connection services.

   For both service types, connections are point-to-point, and can be
   permanent, soft-permanent, or switched. For a static service, the
   network is responsible for the management of both the network
   infrastructure and the end user connections. For dynamic services,
   the network is only responsible for the configuration of the
   infrastructure; end user connections are established dynamically by
   the network.

   Note that the ITU-T allows the second categorization of service type
   to embrace a variety of C-plane types.

4.1.1 L1VPN for Dynamic Layer 1 Provisioning

   Private network services in the second category (above) can be
   enhanced so that multiple private networks are supported across the
   layer 1 network as virtual private networks. These are Layer 1
   Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs). Note the first category would
   include L1VPNs for VPNs with only two CEs as a special case.


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires April 2005               [Page 8]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004



   Compared to the first type of service, the L1VPN service has features
   such as a separate policy per VPN, and distribution of information
   about which CEs can participate in which VPNs.

4.2 Merits of L1VPN

4.2.1 Customer Merits

   From the customer's perspective, there are two main benefits to a
   L1VPN. These benefits apply over and above the advantages of access
   to a dynamically provisioned network.

   - The customer can outsource the direct management of an optical
     network by placing the VPN management in the control of a third
     party. This frees the customer from the need to configure and
     manage the connectivity information for the CEs that participate
     in the VPN.

   - The customer can make small-scale use of an optical network. So,
     for example, by sharing access to the optical network with many
     other users, the customer sites can be connected together across
     the optical network without bearing the full cost of deploying
     and managing the optical network.

   To some extent, the customer may also gain from the provider's
   benefits (see below). That is, if the provider is able to extract
   more value from the layer 1 network, and provide better
   differentiated services, the customer will benefit from lower
   priced services that are better tailored to the customer's needs.

4.2.2 Provider Merits

   The provider benefits from the customer's perception of benefits.

   In particular, the provider can build on dynamic, on-demand services
   by offering new VPN services and off-loading the CE-to-CE
   configuration requirements from the customers

   Additionally, a more flexible VPN structure applied to the optical
   network allows the provider to make more comprehensive use of the
   spare (that is, previously unused) resources within the network. In
   particular, since the PE could be responsible for routing the
   connection through the optical network, the optical network can
   reclaim control of how resources are used and adjust the paths so
   that optimal use is made of all available resources.

4.3 L1VPN Deployment Scenarios



T.Takeda, et al.            Expires April 2005               [Page 9]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


4.3.1 Multi-Service Backbone

   A multi-service backbone is characterized in terms such that one
   service department of a carrier receiving the carrier's L1VPN service
   provides different kinds of higher-layer service. The customer
   receiving the L1VPN service (i.e., each service department) can offer
   its own services whose payloads can be any layer (e.g., ATM, IP,
   TDM). From the L1VPN service provider point of view, these services
   are not visible and are not part of the L1VPN service. That is, the
   type of service being carried within the L1 payload is not known by
   the service provider.

   The benefit is that the same L1 core network resources are shared by
   multiple services. A large capacity backbone network (data plane) can
   be built economically by having the resources shared by multiple
   services usually with flexibility to modify topologies, while
   separating the control functions. Thus, each customer can select a
   specific set of features that are needed to provide their own
   service.

4.3.2 Carrier's Carrier

   A carrier's carrier is characterized in terms such that one carrier
   that receives another carrier's L1VPN service provides its own
   services. In this scenario, two carriers may be in different
   organizations (or may be separately managed within the same
   organization). It is, therefore, expected that the information
   provided at the service demarcation points is more limited than in
   the multi-service backbone case. Similarly, more less control of the
   L1VPN service is given at the service demarcation points. For
   example, customers of L1VPN service receive:

   - more limited view of L1VPN service provider network

   - more limited control over L1VPN service provider network.

   One of the merits is that each carrier can concentrate on a specific
   service. For example, the customer of the L1VPN service may focus on
   L3 services, e.g., providing secure access to the Internet, leaving
   the L1VPN provider to focus on the L1 service, e.g., providing a long
   haul bandwidth between cities. The L1VPN customer can construct its
   own network using L1 resources supplied by the L1VPN provider,
   usually with flexibility to modify topologies, and utilize dedicated
   C-Plane functionalities.

4.3.3 L1 Resource Trading

   In addition to the scenarios where the second tier service provider
   is using a single core service provider as mentioned above, it is


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires April 2005              [Page 10]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


   possible for the second tier provider to receive services from more
   than one core service provider. In this scenario, there are some
   benefits for the second tier service provider such as dynamic carrier
   selection based on the price and route redundancy.

   The second tier service provider can support a function that enables
   a L1 resource trading service. Using resource information published
   by its core service providers, a second tier service providers can
   decide how to best use those providers. For example, if one core
   service provider is no longer able to satisfy requests for service,
   an alternate service provider can be used. Or the second tier service
   provider could choose to respond to price changes over time.

   Another example of second tier service provider use is to reduce
   exposure to failures in each provider (improve availability).

4.3.4 Inter-SP L1 VPN

   In addition to the scenarios where a single connection between two
   CEs is routed over a single service provider, it is possible that a
   connection is routed over multiple service providers. This service
   scenario is called Inter-SP L1VPN.

   This scenario can be used to construct a single L1VPN from services
   provided by multiple regional providers. There could be a variety
   of business relationships among providers and customers.

5. Reference models

   Figure 5.1 describes the L1VPN reference model.

                    Figure 5.1: L1VPN reference model

   In L1VPN, L1 connections are provided between CEs' data plane
   interfaces within the same VPN. In Figure 5.1, a connection is
   provided between the left-hand CE of VPN A and the upper right-hand
   CE of VPN A, and another connection is provided between the left-hand
   CE of VPN B and lower right-hand CE of VPN B (shown as "=" mark).
   These L1 connections are called VPN connections.

5.1 CE/PE/P Terminology

   In the reference model, the following three types of network devices
   are described. Note that these terms are aligned with PPVPN
   terminology [PPVPN-TERM]. In this document, CE, PE and P terms have a
   meaning in the context of L1VPNs, unless specified.

   o CE (Customer Edge) device


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires April 2005              [Page 12]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004



     A CE device is a customer device that receives L1VPN service from
     the provider. A CE device is connected to at least one PE device. A
     CE device can be a variety of devices, for example, TDM cross
     connect, router and L2 switch. A CE device may also be attached to
     one or more C devices on the customer site.

   o PE (Provider Edge) device

     A PE device is a provider device that provides L1VPN service to the
     customer. A PE device is connected to at least one CE device. A
     layer 1 PE device is a TDM or optical cross connect. Or a PE device
     may be an EPL (Ethernet Private Line) type of device, that maps
     Ethernet frames on L1 connections.

   o P (Provider) device

     A P device is a provider device, which is connected only to other
     provider devices (P or PE devices). A layer 1 P is a TDM or optical
     cross connect.

5.2 Customer/Provider Terminology

   In this document, the following two types of administrative entities
   are described.

   o Customer

     A Customer has authority over a set of CE devices within the same
     VPN (e.g., the owner of CE devices). Note that a customer may
     outsource the management of CE devices to other organizations,
     including to the provider itself.

   o Provider

     A Provider has authority over the management of the provider
     network.

5.3 Management Systems

   As shown in the reference model, a provider network may contain a
   management system(s). A management system(s) may support functions
   including provisioning, monitoring, billing and recording. Provider
   management system(s) may also communicate with customer management
   system(s) in order to provide services.

6. Generic Service Description

   This section describes generic service descriptions. More detailed

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


   service description is described as specific service models in
   section 7.

6.1 CE Construct

   - The CE device may support more than one customer VPN.
   - CE-PE data plane links (between data plane interfaces) may be
     shared by multiple VPNs. (assuming that each CE-PE control plane
     link maps one-to-one to a VPN, and maps one-to-one or many-to-one
     to the data plane link)

6.2 Generic Service Features

   L1VPN has following two generic service features.

   - Connectivity restriction: Layer 1 connectivity is provided to a
     limited set of CE's data plane interfaces, called VPN end points.
     (This set forms the L1VPN membership.)
   - Per VPN control and management: Some level of control and
     management capability is provided to the customer. Details differ
     depending on service models described in section 7.

7. Service Models

   This section describes Layer 1 VPN service models, derived from the
   generic service description presented above, that can be supported by
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols enabled networks.

   Such layer 1 networks are managed and controlled using GMPLS as
   described in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]. It must be understood that
   meeting the requirements set out in this document may necessitate
   modifications to the existing GMPLS protocols both for the control
   plane within the layer 1 network and for service provisioning at the
   edge of the network (CE and PE devices). A CE and a PE are
   connected by one or more GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) links as
   defined in [GMPLS-ROUTING]. The ends of each link are usually
   represented as GMPLS-capable interfaces.

7.1 Management-based Service Model

   Figure 7.1 describes the management-based service model.

              Figure 7.1: Management-based service model

   In this service model, customer management system(s) and provider
   management system(s) communicate with each other. Customer
   management system(s) access provider management system(s) to request
   L1 connection setup/deletion between a pair of CEs. Customer
   management system(s) may obtain additional information, such as
   resource availability information and monitoring information, from
   provider management system(s). There is no control message exchange
   between a CE and PE.

   The provider network may be based on GMPLS. In this case, existing
   protocols to meet this service model may need to be extended (e.g.,
   to support soft permanent connections). However, interfaces between
   management systems are not within the scope of this document.
   Interfaces between management systems and network devices may need to
   be studied further.

7.2 Signaling-based Service Model (Overlay Service Model)

   Figure 7.2 describes the signaling-based service model.

               Figure 7.2: Signaling-based service model

   In this service model, the customer interface is based on GMPLS UNI
   overlay. The CE requests L1 connection setup/deletion to a remote CE.
   There is no routing between a CE and PE. The CE does not receive
   routing information of remote CE sites, nor routing information of
   the provider network. The CE's interface may be assigned a public or
   private address, that designates VPN end points.

   A CE may optionally receive a list of TE link addresses to which it
   can request a VPN connection (a list of addresses within the same
   VPN) (overlay extension). Furthermore, this document does not
   preclude the case that a CE receives additional information
   concerning these TE links (e.g., switching type). Note, in the
   overlay extension service model, information a CE can receive is
   limited to the CE-PE TE link.

   Note that in addition, there may be communication between customer
   management system(s) and provider management system(s) in order to
   provide detailed monitoring, fault information etc. to customers.

7.3 Signaling and Routing Service Model

   In this service model, the customer interface is based on GMPLS
   signaling and routing. The CE requests L1 connection setup/deletion
   to a remote CE. There is routing between a CE and PE, or more
   precisely between a CE and the VPN routing context instantiated on
   the PE. By using the received traffic engineering-based routing
   information, customers can use traffic engineering capabilities
   within his portion of the provider network.

   For example, a customer can setup two disjoint connections between a
   pair of CEs. Another example is that a customer can request a
   connection between a pair of devices within CE sites, and not
   necessarily between CEs.

   Link state routing information would be needed to implement the above
   two example scenarios.  Some scenarios may be satisfied with


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires April 2005              [Page 16]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


   reachability routing information only.

   Note that in addition, there may be communication between customer
   management system(s) and provider management system(s) in order to
   provide detailed monitoring, fault information etc. to customers.

   Three specific types of the signaling and routing service model are
   the virtual node service model, the virtual link service model and
   the per VPN peer service model.

7.3.1 Virtual Node Service Model

   Figure 7.3 describes the virtual node service model.

                        +--------------------+
                        |                    |

                  :     +--------------------+     :
                  :     |<-Provider network->|     :
              Customer                         Customer
              interface                        interface

                Figure 7.3: Virtual node service model

   In this type of service model, the whole provider network is
   represented by a virtual node (defined in section 2). The customer
   perceives the provider network as one single node, i.e., a
   Generalized Virtual Private Cross-Connect (GVPXC) [GVPN]. The CE
   receives routing information of CE-PE links and remote CE sites.

7.3.2 Virtual Link Service Model

   Figure 7.4 describes the virtual link service model.

                        +--------------------+
                        |       Virtual      |

                  :     +--------------------+     :
                  :     |<-Provider network->|     :
              Customer                         Customer
              interface                        interface

   In this service model, a virtual link is constructed between PEs.
   For the definition of a virtual link, please refer to terminology in
   section 2. The CE receives routing information of CE-PE links, remote
   CE sites, as well as virtual links. The provider network exclusively
   allocates data plane link resources for each virtual link. The TE
   attributes of a virtual link are determined according to data plane
   link resources allocated to this virtual link.

7.3.3 Per VPN Peer Service Model

   Figure 7.5 describes the per VPN peer service model.

                        +--------------------+
                        |                    |
     +----+       :   +----+    +----+    +----+   :       +----+
     | CE |-------:---| PE |----| P  |----| PE |---:-------| CE |
     +----+       :   +----+    +----+    +----+   :       +----+
                  :     |                    |     :
                  :     +--------------------+     :
                  :     |<-Provider network->|     :
              Customer                         Customer
              interface                        interface

                Figure 7.5: Per VPN peer service model

   In this service model, the provider partitions the TE links within
   the provider network per VPN, and discloses per VPN TE link
   information to corresponding CEs. As such, a CE receives routing
   information of CE-PE links, remote CE sites, as well as partitioned
   portions of the provider network.

   Note that PEs may advertise abstracted routing information of the
   provider network to CEs, for administrative purpose, as well as for
   excluding "unnecessary information". In other words, virtual links
   may be constructed between two nodes where direct physical links do
   not exist, or virtual nodes may be constructed to represent multiple
   physical nodes and links.

   In the per VPN peer service model, at least one virtual node
   corresponding to P devices (one single P or a set of Ps) must be
   visible to customers. In the virtual link service model, every end
   point of virtual links must be a PE device. In the virtual node
   service model, there must be one single virtual node, and this
   virtual node must be connected with every CE in the VPN.
   
8. Service Models and Service Requirements

   Service models mentioned in section 7 are related to which

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


   information is exchanged between CE and PE. In addition, service
   models differ in how data plane resources are allocated for each VPN.

   Note in original ITU-T documents, the term "U-Plane" is used instead
   of "data plane".

   o Data plane resource allocation
       
     - Shared or dedicated : 

       Shared means that provider network data plane links are shared by
       multiple (i.e., any or a specific set of) VPNs. (Data plane links
       are allocated to a VPN when a VPN connection is requested, and
       data plane links allocated to one VPN at one time can be
       allocated to another VPN at another time.)
 
       Dedicated means that provider network data plane links are
       partitioned per VPN. (Data plane links allocated to one VPN can
       not be used by other VPNs.)

   o Information exchanged between CE and PE
      
     - Signaling 
     - Membership information : A list of TE link addresses within the
       same VPN (associated with VPN end points)
     - Customer network routing information
     - Provider network routing information

   Table 1 shows combination of service requirements and service models.

       Table 1: Combination of service requirements and service models


   As described in section 7.3.3, the difference between the virtual
   link service model and the per VPN peer service model is whether
   customers have visibility of P devices. In the virtual link service
   model, every end point of virtual links must be a PE device, thus P
   devices are not visible to customers. In the per VPN peer service
   model, at least one virtual node corresponding to P devices (one
   single P or a set of Ps) is visible to customers.

   Note when provider network routing information is provided to
   customers, customers must be able to specify explicit links for a VPN
   connection over the provider network.

   Some additional and more detailed service requirements are provided
   below. They are generally common to the various service models.

   - Selection of layer 1 class of service: Customers may be optionally
     allowed to specify a layer 1 class of service (e.g., availability
     level) for a VPN connection.

   - Reception of performance information: Customers may be optionally
     allowed to receive performance information of their VPN
     connections. When data plane links are dedicated, customers
     may be optionally allowed to receive performance information of
     links dedicated to them.

   - Reception of fault information: Customers may be optionally allowed

     to receive fault information of their VPN connections. When data
     plane links are dedicated, customers may be optionally allowed
     to receive fault information of links dedicated to them.

   - Reception of connection information: Customers may be optionally
     allowed to receive information of current VPN connections.

   - Specification of policy: Customers may be allowed to specify
     policies (e.g., path computation policies, recovery policies
    including parameters) for each VPN.

   - Security: The communication between the customer and the provider
     must be secure. Further details are described in section 9.

   - Filtering: Unnecessary information (e.g., information concerning
     other VPNs) must not be provided to each customer. Further details
     are described in section 9.

9. Security Considerations

   Security is clearly one of essential requirements in L1VPNs. In this
   section, key security requirements are highlighted. Security
   considerations for L3VPNs and L2VPNs are described in existing
   documents, such as in [L3VPN-FRAME] and [L2VPN-FRAME] respectively.
   These security considerations should also be applied in L1VPNs, and
   these aspects are described in this section. In addition, there are
   some specific security considerations for L1VPNs, such as
   connectivity restriction and shared control links.

   This section first describes types of information to be secured.
   Then, security features or aspects are described. Finally, some
   considerations concerning scenarios where security mechanisms are
   applied is described.

9.1 Types of Information

   The information exchanged between the customer and the provider must
   be secured. This includes data plane information, control plane
   information and management plane information. At Layer 1, data plane
   information is normally assumed to be secured by default. In L1VPNs,
   VPN connections must be restricted within the same VPN, as described
   in section 6.2.

   In addition, information contained in the provider network must be
   secured. This includes VPN service contract information, current VPN
   connection information, VPN membership information, and system
   information. Note these types of information may be accessible to
   authorized entities.

9.2 Security Features

   Security features includes followings:

   o Data integrity

     The information exchanged between the customer and the provider
     must be identical.

   o Confidentiality

     The information exchanged between the customer and the provider
     must not be retrieved by the third party.

   o Authentication

     The entity requesting the service to the provider must be
     identified.

   o Access control

     Access to the information contained in the provider network must be
     restricted to the authorized entity.

9.3 Scenarios

   There are mainly two scenarios (or occasions) that security
   mechanisms are applied. One is service contract phase, where security
   mechanisms are applied once in service contract phase. The other is
   service access phase, where security mechanisms are applied every
   time service is requested.

   o Service contract scenario (static)

     This scenario includes addition of new physical devices, such as CE
     devices, data links and control links. It must be guaranteed that
     these physical devices are connected to the right entity. In
     addition, authority to access specific information is given to each
     customer as a part of service contract.

   o Service access scenario (dynamic)

     This scenario includes reception of connection request, routing
     information exchange request, and management information retrieval
     request. If communication channel between the customer and the
     provider (control channel, management interface) is physically
     separate per customer, and the entity connected over this
     communication channel is identified in the service contract phase,
     the provider can ensure who is requesting the service. Also, the

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-02.txt    October 2004


     communication channel could be considered as secure. However, when
     communication channel is physically shared among customers,
     security mechanisms should be enforced. Note even in the case of
     physically separate communication channel, customers may wish to
     apply security mechanisms, such as IPsec, for assuring higher
     security.

     When the entity requesting the service is identified, the provider
     must ensure that the request is authorized for that entity. This
     includes assuring that connection request is between VPN end points
     belonging to the same VPN.

     Also note that customers may wish to apply their own security
     mechanisms for data plane information (CE-CE security). This
     includes IPsec for IP traffic. Those security mechanisms must be
     transparent to customers as much as possible.
