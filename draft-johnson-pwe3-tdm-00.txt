Abstract 
 
This draft proposes a TDM emulation protocol for consideration by the 
PWE3 Working Group.  The protocol defines methods for transporting DS3, 
E3, DS1, E1, and NxDS0 circuits over packet switched networks.  It is 
based on ATM Circuit Emulation, but optimized for variable length 
packet networks.  The intent is to provide a relatively simple but 
flexible method for transporting TDM signals over packet switched 
networks that also provides a path for interworking with ATM Circuit 
Emulation.

2  Scope 
    
   This document describes a protocol that is intended to satisfy the 
   requirements defined for TDM circuit emulation in [TDM-REQ].   
    
   This document provides methods for emulating the following digital 
   signals across a packet-switched network. 
    
   1. unstructured DS1, E1, DS3, and E3 circuits 
    
   2. structured NxDS0 circuits without CAS 
 
   3. structured NxDS0 circuits with CAS 
    
   For the remainder of this document, these will be referred to as TDM 
   services.   
    
   Because NSPs are already defined to provide various TDM multiplexing 
   and mapping functions, the protocol is applicable to any TDM service 
   regardless of the multiplexing level at which the service is 
   connected to the PE.  For example, unstructured emulation format can 
   be used regardless of whether a T1 circuit is attached to the PE as 
   a discrete T1, as a T1 within a channelized DS3, as a T1 within a 
   channelized DS3 mapped onto an STS-1, etc.   
    
   This goal of this protocol is to provide a simple method to 
   transport TDM circuits across the PSN.  Any multiplexing, mapping, 
   or translation functions defined for the emulated service can be 
   applied at the PE using existing NSPs defined by the appropriate 
   standards bodies such as ANSI and ITU-T.

3  CEP-TDM Encapsulation Format 
    
   In order to transport TDM services through a packet-oriented 
   network, the TDM bit-stream is broken into fragments.  A CEP Header 
   is pre-pended to each fragment.  The resulting packet is 
   encapsulated in RTP for transmission over an arbitrary PSN.   
    
   (Note: under certain circumstances the RTP header may be suppressed 
   to conserve network bandwidth.  See section 3.4.3 for details). 
    
   The basic CEP packet appears in Figure 1.

3.1 TDM Fragment 
   There are three modes of operation for TDM Circuit Emulation: 
   Unstructured, NxDS0 w/o CAS, and NxDS0 w/ CAS. 
 
3.1.1   Unstructured (DS1, E1, DS3, E3) 
    
   All CEP-TDM implementations MUST support the basic unstructured mode 
   of operation as described below.   
    
   For example all DS1 end-points MUST support DS1 unstructured mode of 
   operation, all E1 end-points MUST support E1 unstructured mode of 
   operation, etc. 
    
   In unstructured mode, there is no implied bit or byte alignment 
   between the TDM service and the TDM fragments.   
    
   The first bit received from the bit-stream MUST be the Most 
   Significant Bit of each byte in the TDM fragment.   
    
   Bytes are placed into the bit-stream fragment in the same order in 
   which they are received. 
    
   Implementations MUST support a bit-stream fragment size that is 376 
   bytes, and MAY support other sizes.   
    
   Implementation MUST NOT assume any bit, byte, or frame alignment 
   within the fragments. 
    
3.1.2   NxDS0 with CAS 
    
   CEP-TDM implementations MAY implement NxDS0 mode with CAS.   
    
   In NxDS0 mode with CAS, the timeslots for the selected channels are 
   concatenated in a superframe format as illustrated below.  The 
   number of frames in the CEP-TDM superframe MUST be 16 frames for E1-
   NxDS0 and 24 frames for T1-NxDS0.  This implies that any 
   interworking between formats (such as T1 to E1, etc.) MUST take 
   place in NSPs at either end of the PSN.  The goal of the PW is 
   simply to carry the NxDS0 circuit with CAS through the PSN. 
    
   Immediately following the last timeslot of the NxDS0 superframe, a 
   signaling substructure is appended.  This substructure carries the 
   ABCD signaling bits associated with each timeslot in the order shown 
   below.  The A bit is the MSB of each nibble within the signaling 
   substructure.  If N is an odd number, a pad nybble MUST be appended 
   to the end of the signaling substructure. 
    
   The structure pointer in the CEP-TDM header MUST point to the first 
   timeslot of the NxDS0 superframe within the packet.

   Implementation MUST support a basic mode of operation where the 
   entire superframe structure is included in a single packet.  In this 
   basic mode of operation, the first timeslot MUST always be the first 
   byte of the packet and the structure pointer in the CEP-TDM header 
   MUST always be zero. 
    
   Implementations SHOULD support other packet sizes to trade-off 
   packetization latency for packet overhead.  In these cases, 
   implementations MUST NOT assume any relationship between the start 
   of the superframe and the packet boundaries.  The structure pointer 
   in the CEP-TDM header MUST be used to locate the start of the 
   superframe within the packet stream.

3.1.3   NxDS0 without CAS 
    
   CEP-TDM implementations MAY implement NxDS0 mode without CAS.   
    
   The superframe structure for NxDS0 without CAS is exactly the same 
   as the superframe structure for NxDS0 with CAS, except that the 
   signaling substructure is NOT appended to the end of the superframe. 
    
   This is illustrated below for an NxDS0 circuit without CAS for N=3.

   Implementation MUST support a basic mode of operation where the 
   entire superframe structure is included in a single packet.  A 
   superframe consists of 16 frames for E1-NxDS0 and 24 frames for T1-
   NxDS0.  In this basic mode of operation, the first timeslot MUST 
   always be the first byte of the packet and the structure pointer in 
   the CEP-TDM header MUST always be zero. 
    
   Implementations SHOULD support other packet sizes to trade-off 
   packetization latency for packet overhead.  In these cases, 
   implementations MUST NOT assume any relationship between the start 
   of the superframe and the packet boundaries.  The structure pointer 
   in the CEP-TDM Header MUST be used to locate the start of the 
   superframe within the packet stream.

3.2 CEP Header 
    
   The Basic CEP header has the following format: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
 
    
   The above fields are defined as follows: 
 
   R bit: CEP-RDI.  This bit is set to one to signal to the remote CEP 
   function that a loss of packet synchronization has occurred.   
    
   D, N, and P bits:  For CEP-TDM emulation, only a sub-set of the 
   code-points defined by CEP-SPE/VT are utilized.  See Table 1 for 
   more details.

         Table 1. Interpretation of D, N, and P bits 
    
   Sequence Number[0:13]:  This is a packet sequence number, which MUST 
   continuously cycle from 0 to 0x3FFF.  It is generated and processed 
   in accordance with the rules established in [RFC1889].  When the RTP 
   header is used, this sequence number MUST match the LSBs of the RTP 
   sequence Number. 
    
   Structure Pointer[0:12]: The Structure Pointer locates the TDM 
   structure within the TDM fragment.  In structured data transfer 
   mode, this MUST contain the offset to the first timeslot of the 
   structure.  The value is from 0 to 0x1FFE, where 0 means the first 
   byte after the CEP header. The Structure Pointer MUST be set to 
   0x1FFF for packets that do not contain the first timeslot of the 
   structure or for unstructured data transfer.

   o V (version) is always set to 2 
    
   o P (padding) is always set to 0 
    
   o X (header extension) is always set to 0 
    
   o CC (CSRC count) is always set to 0 
    
   o M (marker) is set to 0 for CEP packets. 
    
   o PT (payload type) is used to identify packets carrying the 
   packetized TDM data.  One PT value should be allocated from the 
   range of dynamic values (see [RTP-TYPES]) for every CEP PW. 
   Allocation is done during the PW setup and MUST be the same for both 
   PW directions. The PE at the PW ingress MUST set the PT value in the 
   RTP header to the allocated value.  
    
   o Sequence Number is used primarily to provide the common PW 
   sequencing function as well as detection of lost packets.  It is 
   generated and processed in accordance with the rules established in 
   [RFC1889].   
    
   o Timestamp is used primarily for carrying timing information over 
   the network.  Their values are used in accordance with the rules 
   established in [RFC1889].       
     
   O SSRC (synchronization source) value in the RTP header MAY be used 
   for detection of misconnections.

3.4 PSN Encapsulation 
    
   In principle, CEP packets can be carried over any packet-oriented 
   network.  The following sections describe specifically how CEP 
   packets MUST be encapsulated for carriage over MPLS or IP networks. 
 
    
3.4.1   IP Encapsulation 
    
   CEP uses the standard IP/UDP/RTP encapsulation scheme as shown 
   below. The UDP destination port MUST be used to Demultiplex 
   individual emulated TDM streams.

3.4.2   MPLS Encapsulation 
    
   RTP MAY be directly encapsulated in MPLS as shown below.  To 
   transport a CEP packet over an MPLS network, an MPLS label-stack 
   MUST be pushed on top of the CEP packet.  The bottom label in the 
   MPLS label stack MUST be used to demultiplex individual emulated TDM 
   streams.  In keeping with the conventions used in [MARTINI-TRANS], 
   this demultiplexing label is referred to as the PW Label and the 
   upper labels are referred to as Tunnel Labels.

3.4.3   RTP Header Suppression 
    
   In addition to normal RTP header compression mechanisms as described 
   in [RFC2508] and [RFC3095], an additional option may be used in CEP 
   which suppresses transmission of the RTP header altogether.   
    
   This mode may be used when both Circuit Emulation PEs are run 
   synchronously and have access to a common reference clock or 
   adaptive timing recovery techniques are being used, and both PEs 
   support RTP Header Suppression.  Under these conditions the 
   following encapsulation formats may be used. 
    
   The choice to utilize RTP Header Suppression may be statically 
   configured, or signaled using a PW maintenance protocol.

4  Bit Timing 
    
   There are three methods for addressing bit timing on the reassembled 
   TDM stream.  Synchronous, Adaptive, and Relative. 
    
   Synchronous mode assumes that a common reference is available at 
   both ends of the PSN that can be used to provide bit timing for the 
   reassembled signal.   
    
   Adaptive Timing may be used when a suitable reference is not 
   available at both ends of the PSN.  The details of adaptive timing 
   recovery techniques are beyond the scope of this draft.  However, 
   [AAL1] provides some useful discussion on the topic for reference. 
    
   Relative Timing may be used when a high quality common reference is 
   available at each end of the PSN that is asynchronous to the TDM 
   circuit being emulated.  This case is analogous to the SRTS method 
   described in [AAL1].  The RTP time-stamp may be used to capture the 
   relative timing differences between the emulated signal and the 
   reference clock.  Details are TBD. 

5  Misconfiguration Protection 
    
   A key component of TDM circuit emulation is insuring that a TDM 
   circuit is never delivered to the wrong end user.   
    
   To aid in this effort, PE implementations targeting MPLS networks 
   SHOULD utilize [MPLS OAM] or [MPLS PING]. 
    
   Implementations utilizing [MPLS OAM] SHOULD validate the 
   Connectivity Verification Packet contents to ensure that the Trail 
   Trace Source ID matches the expected Trail Trace Source ID.  If it 
   does not, the associated TDM circuit should NOT be presented to the 
   CE by the PE.   
    

6  Performance Monitoring 
    
   Another key component of TDM circuits is meeting defined service 
   level agreements (SLAs).  To verify the appropriate service level is 
   being met, CEP-TDM will define several performance monitors. 
    
   All performance monitoring will be based on the detection of lost 
   packets by the CE-bound PE.  Packets may be lost for several reasons 
   including discard within the PSN due to congestion, arrival after 
   its play-out time has passed, due to errors in the packet itself 
   (such as IP checksum failure or L2 Frame Check Sequence Failure).   
    
   Specific performance monitors that will be supported are:

   CEP-TDM Errored Seconds (ES) - Seconds during which one or more 
   dropped packets were detected. 
    
   CEP-TDM Severely Errored Seconds (SES)- Seconds during which 3 or 
   more dropped packets were detected.   
    
   CEP-TDM Unavailable Seconds (UAS) - Seconds during which packet 
   synchronization was lost.   

7  Security Considerations 
   A generic approach to security for L1 services must be developed 
   that is applicable to emulated SONET/SDH circuits as well as TDM 
   circuits.  When that solution is developed, it will be incorporated 
   into this document. 

8  Network Congestion Considerations 
    
   A generic approach to Network Congestion for CBR services must be 
   developed that is applicable to emulated ATM-CBR circuits, emulated 
   SONET/SDH circuits and TDM circuits.  When the generic approach has 
   been specified, it will be incorporated into this document.   

9  Applicability Statement 
    
   TDM Circuit Emulation over Packet (CEP) is an encapsulation layer 
   intended for emulating TDM circuits over a Packet Switched Network. 
    
   This protocol provides a method for emulating the key elements of 
   traditional TDM services across a packet-switched network.  Both 
   large fixed-facility network operators and smaller network operators 
   using ad hoc facilities may use this service. 
    
   The protocol makes no assumptions as to the contents of the TDM 
   circuit, and therefore is applicable to TDM circuits carrying any 
   type of payload.
