1. Introduction 
    
   The provision of Quality of Service (QoS) is an intrinsic part of 
   emerging services centered on provider-provisioned VPNs (PPVPNs). The 
   standardization of issues related to QoS has been the focus of 
   several working groups within IETF. However, the provision of QoS in 
   the context of PPVPNs introduces a number of specific issues that 
   have not been addressed by existing work on QoS. Furthermore, some of 
   the specific PPVPN solutions that have recently emerged have their 
   own QoS aspects that need to be defined. For these reasons, there is 
   a need for a standardization effort on QoS that builds on what 
   defined by other working groups, but is explicitly targeted at 
   PPVPNs. 
    
   The scope of this document is the provision of QoS within the PPVPN 
   cloud. In other words, we focus on the provision of QoS from one VPN 
   endpoint to another. Clearly, in order to provide end-to-end QoS, the 
   QoS issues specific to the portion of the network from the end user 
   to the edge of the PPVPN cloud also have to be addressed. Such issues 
   are outside of the scope of this document, since they have been 
   addressed by other working groups and are not specific of PPVPNs. 
   This document discussed QoS aspect pertaining to Layer 3 VPNs, Layer 
   2 VPNs, and CE-based VPNs (material on CE-based VPNÆs will be added 
   in future version of this document). MPLS-based VPNs, IPSec VPNs, GRE 
   VPNs, and L2TP VPNs are discussed.  
    
   A first, most obvious QoS issue that is specific of PPVPNs stems from 
   the structure of outer tunnel/inner tunnel that is characteristic of 
   most emerging VPN solutions. There is a need to allocate QoS 
   resources in the network for both outer and inner tunnels, possibly 
   incrementally. QoS provides compelling reasons for supporting 
   multiple outer tunnels between PEs, which introduces new requirements

   in the binding of inner and outer tunnels. Accordingly, a number of 
   signaling extensions to existing protocols are needed to support the 
   provision of QoS in the VPN context.  
    
   Similarly, in MPLS VPN solutions, the presence of two labels requires 
   the marking of QoS information (policing and/or class of service 
   information) at both levels. 
    
   In general, in the context of PPVPNs, two levels of QoS are relevant: 
   QoS of the VPN and QoS within the VPN. In fact, not only a given VPN 
   may be assigned a certain level of QoS, but also a certain VPN may 
   carry traffic of different characteristics, which requires different 
   QoS treatment within the VPN. The possible solutions to support such 
   a configuration may introduce a number of subtle issues, including 
   learning across the various levels of QoS. 
    
   The QoS models that are relevant in the context of PPVPNs need to be 
   specified, since they can be quite complex, especially when 
   hierarchical VPNÆs are considered 
    
   PPVPN services with QoS can become very elaborate, since a wide range 
   of variations is possible. Accordingly, the Service Level Agreements 
   can become complex, and need to be defined.  
    
   Finally, once QoS is considered, auto-discovery of the VPN endpoints 
   and automatic provisioning of the VPN service become challenging, and 
   need to be specified. 
    
   The multipoint nature of many VPN services introduces a level of 
   complexity in terms of QoS that has not yet been exhaustively 
   addressed in other contexts. Although PPVPNs are not the only 
   multipoint service requiring QoS, they are a prominent example that 
   can be used to drive the standardization effort for many aspects of 
   multipoint QoS.  
    
2. Background 
    
2.1.    PPVPN Architectures of Interest 
 
   The PPVPN framework documents [VPN-L3FW][VPN-L2FW] distinguish 
   different types of VPNs: Provider Provisioned PE-based L3 VPNs, 
   Provider Provisioned CE-based VPNs, and Provider Provisioned L2 
   VPNs. The PPVPN WG explicitly aims at defining mechanisms to provide 
   VPN services over an IP or MPLS network. This means that different 
   tunneling technologies can be used to tunnel the VPN traffic over 
   the shared SP backbone network. Examples of such tunneling 
   technologies are MPLS, IP-in-IP, IPsec, L2TP, and GRE. Both the type 
   of VPN (the type of service offered to the customer) and the 
   tunneling technology used in the SP backbone network can have 
   implications with regards to the offering of QoS.

   This section gives some background information on each of these 
   concepts. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the 
   terminology used in [VPN-term],[VPN-L3FW],[VPN-L2FW]. 
    
   The term "Virtual Private Network" (VPN) refers to the communication 
   between a set of sites, making use of a shared network 
   infrastructure.  Multiple sites of a private network may therefore 
   communicate via the public infrastructure, in order to facilitate 
   the operation of the private network. 
    
2.1.1.  Provider Provisioned PE-based L3 VPNs 
    
   A layer 3 PE-based VPN is one in which the SP takes part in IP level 
   forwarding based on the customer network's IP address space.  In 
   general, the customer network is likely to make use of private 
   and/or non-unique IP addresses.  This implies that at least some 
   devices in the provider network needs to understand the IP address 
   space as used in the customer network.  Typically this knowledge is 
   limited to the PE device that is directly attached to the customer. 
   These PE devices typically implement Virtual Routing and Forwarding 
   instances (VFI) for VPN context separation. 
    
   Currently, two approaches for providing PP PE-based L3 VPNs are 
   being considered within the PPVPN working group.  
    
   The "BGP/MPLS VPN" approach [rfc2547bis] uses MPLS for packet 
   forwarding in the SP's backbone network, and uses BGP between PEs 
   for VPN membership auto-discovery and for inter-site VPN 
   reachability information distribution. In this approach, the PE 
   routers implement Virtual Routing and Forwarding tables (VRF) for IP 
   context separation. Extensions to the base ôBGP/MPLS VPNö approach 
   are defined in [PE-GRE] and [PE-IPsec] for the use of other 
   tunneling mechanisms in the SP's backbone. 
    
   The ôVirtual Routerö-based approach [VR-VPN] allows for the use of 
   any tunneling mechanism for packet forwarding in the SPÆs backbone 
   network. In this approach, ôVirtual Routersö (VR) are implemented in 
   the PE devices for VPN context separation. Tunnels are established 
   between the VRs of the same VPN, in the different PEs. The VPN 
   reachability information is distributed between the different sites 
   of the same VPN by tunneling VPN-specific routing protocol messages 
   through the tunnels that interconnect the VRs. The BGP-based 
   mechanism described in [BGP-VPN] can be used for VPN membership 
   discovery. 
         
2.1.2.  Provider Provisioned CE-based VPNs 
    
   In CE-based VPNs, the customer network is supported by tunnels which 
   are set up between CE devices.  The tunnels may make use of various 
   encapsulations (such as MPLS, GRE, IPsec, IP-in-IP, or L2TP tunnels) 
   to send traffic over a shared IP/MPLS SPÆs backbone network. For

   provider provisioned CE-based VPNs, the provisioning and management 
   of the tunnels is performed by the SP. In this case the provider may 
   also configure routing protocols on the CE devices.  In this case, 
   routing in the private network is partially under the control of the 
   customer, and partially under the control of the SP. Note that, as 
   the VPN tunnels originate and terminate at the CE devices, the SP 
   network is not involved in any specific VPN task. This implies that 
   the SP network does not take part in IP level forwarding based on 
   the customer networkÆs IP address space. The tunneled customer 
   packets might even be encrypted and as such be unreadable by the 
   SPÆs network elements. The SPÆs involvement in the customerÆs VPN is 
   solely by means of itÆs management and provisioning system. In the 
   PPVPN WG, the efforts in the CE-based VPN space currently focus on 
   the use of IPsec to protect the inter-site customer traffic [IPsec-
   VPN]. 
    
2.1.3.  Provider Provisioned L2 VPNs 
    
   MPLS-based Layer 2 
    
   a) MPLS-based Layer 2: Point-to-Point 
    
   ATM and Frame Relay provider networks were commonly used to provide 
   point-to-point layer 2 services to end-customers. Recently there has 
   been renewed interest in providing such layer 2 services over IP or 
   MPLS-based networks. Typically, this would be achieved by 
   provisioning ôvirtual circuitsö that run over IP or MPLS tunnels in 
   the provider networks.  
    
   The most basic type of L2 VPN service is a point-to-point one where 
   Layer 2 traffic from one customer site is transported transparently 
   to a remote customer site. The L2 packets from the customer site are 
   encapsulated by the ingress PE device, mapped to a pre-defined LSP 
   for that virtual connection, transported to the egress PE device, 
   and delivered to the remote CE. The VC LSP may be further 
   encapsulated over a tunnel which may be MPLS or IP-based. [Martini-
   ENC] defines the way in which such Layer 2 packets are encapsulated 
   over the provider VC tunnel. Martini-transport [Martini-TRANS] 
   defines LDP protocol extensions to support this feature.  
    
   A different approach to Layer 2 VPNÆs is described in [Kompella], 
   where similar features are provided using BGP extensions, in a 
   manner fairly similar to the Layer 3 BGP-based approach. 
         
   2.1.2.2 MPLS-based Layer 2: VPLS & TLS 
    
   There has been particular effort to extend the L2 point-to-point 
   service for Ethernet services in order to build emulated or 
   transparent LAN services. The primary goal of such services is to 
   reduce the provisioning associated with point-to-point Ethernet 
   service connection and to make the service provider network appear as

   a single distributed Layer 2 Ethernet switch in relation to the 
   various CE devices of the customer.  
    
   There have been various proposals in this area. In most cases, unlike 
   the point-to-point service case, in TLS, each CE site will only 
   require a single connection to the provider. The PE device will be 
   responsible for learning and forwarding of customer packets to the 
   appropriate remote PE device. Encapsulation of customer packets 
   occurs in the same manner as the point-to-point case. The difference 
   between the various proposals is in where the MAC 
   learning/broadcasts/forwarding are to occur. In some cases, all 
   learning can be done on the ingress PE. In other cases, learning 
   occurs on both the ingress and egress PE. In yet other cases, the PE 
   is considered to be distributed in order to provide scalability.  
    
   Apart from learning and other such dataplane issues, there is also 
   the manner in which auto-discovery is performed. Typically, BGP would 
   be used as the protocol to aid in auto-discovery of PEs that are 
   connected to CE(s) for a particular customer.  
    
   Various proposals include [Lasserre], [Kompella-DTLS], and [Sajassi]. 
    
2.2.    VPN Tunneling Mechanisms of Interest 
    
   o MPLS [RFC3031] [RFC3035] 
    
        Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwarding 
        packets through a network. Routers at the edge of a network 
        apply simple labels to packets. A specific path (a tunnel in 
        the PPVPN context) is called a ælabel switched pathÆ (LSP). 
        MPLS allows for tunnel multiplexing (æinnerÆ and æouterÆ LSPs) 
        and for the transport of data packets other than IP. Tunnels 
        are established using RSVP-TE or (CR-)LDP. The MPLS QoS-related 
        characteristics will be detailed elsewhere in this document. 
    
   o IP-in-IP [RFC2003] [RFC2473] 
    
        IP-in-IP encapsulation allows an IP datagram to be encapsulated 
        within another IP datagram. Once the encapsulated datagram 
        arrives at the intermediate destination (as specified in the 
        outer IP header), it is decapsulated, yielding the original IP 
        datagram, which is then delivered to the destination indicated 
        by the original destination address field. IP-in-IP 
        encapsulation doesnÆt explicitly allow for multiplexing, though 
        this can be achieved by using different (outer) IP addresses 
        for different VPNs. IP-in-IP needs extensions to carry packets 
        other than IP. There are no standard mechanisms to establish 
        and maintain IP-in-IP tunnels.

        IP-in-IP tunneling itself does not have intrinsic QoS/SLA 
        capabilities. But, mechanisms such as RSVP extensions [RFC2764] 
        or DiffServ extensions [RFC2983] may be used with it.  
    
   o GRE [RFC2784] 
    
        Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) specifies a protocol for 
        encapsulating an arbitrary payload protocol over an arbitrary 
        delivery protocol. A GRE tunnel is a communication path between 
        two endpoints established by the use of GRE. A ækey fieldÆ 
        [RFC2890] extension to GRE is defined to support multiplexing. 
        GRE is assumed to support any type of payload protocol. There 
        are no standard ways for setting up and maintaining GRE 
        tunnels. 
         
        GRE itself does not have intrinsic QoS/SLA capabilities.  These 
        capabilities depend on the delivery protocol (IP/MPLS). Other 
        mechanisms such as Diffserv or RSVP extensions [RFC2746] may be 
        used with it. 
    
   o IPsec [RFC2401] [RFC2402] [RFC2406] [RFC2409] 
    
        IP Security (IPsec) provides security services at the IP layer 
        [RFC2401].  It comprises authentication header (AH) protocol 
        [RFC2402], encapsulating security payload (ESP) protocol 
        [RFC2406], and Internet key exchange (IKE) protocol [RFC2409].  
        AH protocol provides data integrity, data origin 
        authentication, and an anti-replay service.  ESP protocol 
        provides data confidentiality and limited traffic flow 
        confidentiality.  It may also provide data integrity, data 
        origin authentication, and an anti-replay service. AH and ESP 
        may be used in combination. 
         
        IPsec may be employed in either transport or tunnel mode. In 
        transport mode, either an AH or ESP header is inserted between 
        the IPv4 header and the transport protocol header. In tunnel 
        mode, an IP packet is encapsulated with an outer IP packet 
        header.  Either an AH or ESP header is inserted between them.  
        AH and ESP establish a unidirectional secure communication path 
        between two endpoints, which is called a security association. 
        In tunnel mode, two security associations compose a tunnel 
        between PE devices.  The IKE protocol is used to set up IPsec 
        tunnels. 
         
        The SPI field of AH and ESP is used to multiplex security 
        associations (or tunnels) between two peer devices. It is not 
        possible however, to multiplex traffic from different VPNs 
        within the same security association. IPsec needs extensions to 
        carry packets other than IP. Alternatively, GRE may be used 
        with it.

        IPsec itself does not have intrinsic QoS/SLA capabilities. 
        Other mechanisms such as æRSVP Extensions for IPsec Data FlowsÆ 
        [RFC2207] or DiffServ extensions [RFC2983] may be used with it. 
         
        CE-based VPNs may use tunnel-mode IPsec (or may perform 
        transport-mode IPsec on IP-in-IP encapsulated packets) with ESP 
        to encrypt the customerÆs packets before sending them to the PE 
        device. This means that the information in the customerÆs IP 
        packet (IP header and payload) is unusable by the PE device. An 
        important consequence is that the SPÆs network can not use this 
        information for QoS-related tasks. Some of the IP packetÆs IP 
        header information (such as the DSCP) might be copied or 
        translated though into equivalent information in the (visible) 
        outer IP header, at the CE device. 
    
   o L2TP [L2TPv3] 
    
        The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a dynamic 
        tunneling mechanism for multiple Layer 2 (L2) circuits across a 
        packet-oriented data network. The base L2TP protocol consists 
        of (1) the control protocol for dynamic creation, maintenance, 
        and teardown of L2TP sessions, and (2) the L2TP data 
        encapsulation to multiplex and demultiplex L2 data streams 
        between IP-connected L2TP nodes. 
         
        L2TP itself does not have intrinsic QoS/SLA capabilities. Other 
        mechanisms, such as æL2TP Differentiated Services ExtensionÆ 
        [DS-L2TP] may be used with it. 
         
2.3.    Service Models 
    
   Two main QoS models have been defined: 
    
   A. The ôPipe Model,ö where the QoS specifications are given on a per 
   pair of endpoints; and 
    
   B. The ôHose Model,ö where the QoS specifications are given for each 
   demarcation point between the user and the network. 
    
   The service model besides the traffic specification may also include 
   the QoS treatment to be applied to the packets. The QoS specification 
   depends upon the capabilities of the network that is carrying the 
   service. For example, if the network implements a Diffserv solution, 
   a PHB can be specified for the service. The SLS specification should 
   correspondingly make sure that the desired QoS treatment can be 
   supported in the network. 
 
2.4.    Existing QoS Frameworks for Hard and Soft Guarantees

                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
   In recent years, QoS has received enormous attention in the 
   technical community. Several QoS frameworks have been proposed, 
   studied in depth, and standardized by various working groups. 
    
   Despite the large body of work on QoS, however, considerable 
   confusion still exists on what can be achieved by the different 
   frameworks, and sometimes even accepted terminology bears different 
   meaning to different people. 
    
   For the purposes of this document, we distinguish two classes of QoS 
   guarantees: 
    
   A. QoS guarantees that are precisely provided to individual end 
   users, regardless of traffic conditions; we refer to this type of 
   guarantees as ôhard guarantees.ö 
    
   B. QoS guarantees that are provided to aggregates, or classes of 
   users; these guarantees translate to guarantees to the individual 
   users that are not as precise as the hard guarantee; we refer to 
   this type of guarantees as ôsoft guarantees.ö 
    
   A common source of confusion stems from the fact hard guarantees can 
   be achieved even when users are aggregated within the network, if 
   proper scheduling and queuing is used throughout the network. 
    
   Several frameworks have been proposed to provide various types of 
   guarantees. The Integrated Services (int-serv) framework is capable 
   of providing hard guarantees to individual users in terms of 
   bandwidth, delay, and jitter. 
    
   More recently, the simpler Differentiated Services (diff-serv) 
   framework has become popular. Diff-serv uses an aggregated vision of 
   the users into a relatively small number of Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs) 
   to provide various guarantees, using traffic conditioning at the 
   edges of the network. Diff-serv does not claim to offer hard 
   guarantees to individual users, but rather achieves guarantees to 
   the aggregates. 
    
   Need to precisely define what is achieved using the diff-serv 
   framework, for each class, otherwise it may generate confusion (to 
   be added in future versions of this document). 
 
   Other QoS frameworks with different properties are emerging, some of 
   them proprietary (yet often compatible with int-serv and diff-serv).  
    
   One relevant example is the 802.1p specification, which defines a 
   class-based framework that comprises 8 different classes of 
   services.  
    


     
                Informational - Expires December 2002              10

   The various QoS frameworks can be mapped into each other. For 
   example, 802.1p can be supported in a diff-serv cloud in a rather 
   straightforward manner. 
    
   More to be added in future versions of this document on diff-serv 
   support in MPLS (E-LSPs, L-LSPs). 
    
2.5.    Traffic Engineering 
    
   Internet traffic engineering is defined as that aspect of Internet 
   network engineering dealing with the issue of performance evaluation 
   and performance optimization of operational IP networks [TE]. 
    
   One of the most distinctive functions performed by Internet traffic 
   engineering is the control and optimization of the routing function, 
   to steer traffic through the network in the most effective way. For 
   intra-domain optimization, extensions for traffic engineering have 
   been defined for the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), e.g. OSPF 
   [OSPF-TE] or IS-IS [ISIS-TE]. The information disseminated by these 
   IGP extensions can be used to perform a constraint-based routing 
   computation on the network. When MPLS is used to set up explicit 
   routes in the network, the signaling can be done with RSVP-TE [RSVP-
   TE] or CR-LDP [CR-LDP]. 
    
   The IGP and signaling extensions and procedures that are needed for 
   supporting Diff-Serv traffic engineering requirements defined in 
   [DSTE-REQ] (beyond those already specified in [OSPF-TE][ISIS-
   TE][RSVP-TE][CR-LDP]) in environments relying on distributed 
   Constraint Based Routing are detailed in [DS-TE]. 
    
   Alternatively, traffic engineering can be performed in a centralized 
   way by means of a global optimization algorithm. In that case, the 
   availability of global network and traffic information and additional 
   computational resources may lead to better optimization, at the cost 
   of reduced responsiveness. 
    
2.6.    QoS Building Blocks 
    
   This section summarizes some of the relevant building blocks to 
   provide QoS. 
    
   To assure quality of service in a network for traffic flows, 
   resources need to be reserved, traffic appropriately queued  and 
   scheduled at the multiplexers, routers, and switches, and  
   congestion management need to be performed. The resource reservation 
   is generally performed based on signaled traffic parameters (e.g., 
   RSVP-TE or CR-LDP allows traffic parameters to be associated with 
   each LSP). Also to make sure that a traffic flow does not exceed its 
   resource usage by sending more than what it asked for, a traffic 
   policer may be used to "police" the traffic from a given flow. 
   Therefore, some of the basic building blocks that are needed in a 
     
                Informational - Expires December 2002              11 
                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
   node/network to assure QoS are: 1) Traffic parameter signaling and 
   associated resource reservation (also known as Call Admission 
   Control (CAC)), 2) Traffic queuing and appropriate scheduling, 3) 
   Buffer management and congestion control techniques, 4) Traffic 
   classification in order to associate the traffic flow to given 
   resources and 5) Traffic policing to ensure that a flow does not 
   exceed its traffic contract. 
         
2.6.1.  Policing 
         
   Traffic policing is the means by which a flow's traffic can be 
   checked against its traffic contract. Traffic policers can mark the 
   traffic with colors (green, yellow or red) based on the conformance 
   definition and take action either to pass or drop r remark (if the 
   packet is already colored) the traffic. For example, srTCM [RFC2697] 
   is a single rate  three color marker and trTCM [RFC2698] is a two 
   rate three color marker. The traffic that is passed and colored is 
   appropriately buffered in the node and scheduled for transmission 
   onto a link. The  scheduling should ensure that all the packets 
   (though colored differently) of a given flow belonging to a given 
   class are delivered in sequence.  
    
   A service provider may deploy traffic policers at the SAPs to limit 
   the traffic, at the network edge. There can be some scenarios where 
   traffic policers may need to be deployed within the network at some 
   traffic merge points and egress points depending upon the network 
   scenario. For example, in a multi-point service model with a "hose" 
   specification, the total traffic that may arrive to the egress SAP 
   from the network can exceed the hose specification and thus may need 
   to be policed or shaped. Similarly in a "hub and spoke" model, when 
   two are more spokes join, the total traffic specification may exceed 
   the egress tunnel and needs policing / shaping. 
         
2.6.2.  Classification 
    
   Traffic classification is the "set of rules" that the traffic must 
   possess in order to get a specific QoS treatment in the network. 
   Depending upon the service scenarios, the rules can be either very 
   simple (e.g., all the traffic from port #1) or a complex set (e.g., 
   multi-field classification such as IP addresses, VLAN tags, port 
   numbers, ToS bytes, MPLS labels). When an incoming packet matches to 
   a classification rule, the packet is treated as per its QoS 
   requirements at all the building blocks within the node (policing, 
   queueing, congestion control and scheduling) 
    
2.6.3.  Scheduling/shaping 
 
   Scheduling involves how the traffic in the buffer from various 
   classes is served and transmitted on the link. Some common examples 
   of the scheduling techniques are strict priority (where traffic 
   classes are assigned a priority internally and traffic from higher 
     
                Informational - Expires December 2002              12 
                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
   priority is always served first), Round Robin (where traffic is 
   equally served from all classes in a round robin fashion) or 
   Weighted Fair Queueing (where weights are allocated to the traffic 
   flows and served as per the weight allocation). The schedulers can 
   be classified as work conserving and non-work conserving. Traffic 
   "shaping" is a form of non-work conserving scheduler that sends the 
   traffic as per the parameters the traffic need to be shaped on (e.g. 
   peak rate <100Mbps). 
 
2.6.4.  Buffer management and Congestion Control 
         
   Buffer management, scheduling and congestion control techniques are 
   generally implementation specific. Buffer management involves how 
   the total available buffer is allocated to the traffic classes, e.g, 
   complete partitioning, complete sharing or partial sharing with 
   mimimum allocation. The buffer management schemes should be able to 
   handle multiple class types and colors. 
    
   Congestion control is the treatment of traffic when buffer 
   congestion occurs. Techniques generally employed are tail drop 
   (traffic is dropped if the buffer occupancy exceeds a threshold), 
   push out (high priority traffic can push the low priority traffic to 
   make room) etc. This type of congestion control is performed at the 
   onset of congestion. Other commonly employed techniques use 
   congestion avoidance for buffer control. Random Early Discard (RED) 
   is one such active queue management technique that may drop traffic 
   based on average queue depths (instead of instantaneous) and a drop 
   probability. 
    
    
3. Bandwidth Guarantees and Service Level Agreements 
    
3.1.    QoS Frameworks in PPVPNÆs  
    
3.1.1.  Scope 
    
   As mentioned in the Introduction the scope of this document is to 
   discuss QoS from from VPN Endpoint to VPN Endpoint. In other words, 
   we do not address QoS from CE to CE; QoS in the last leg has to be 
   defined separately, and is addressed by some other WG, since it is 
   not specific of PPVPNÆs.  
    
   We define the VPN Endpoint in the port at the very edge of the PPVPN 
   cloud. Specifically, we consider two cases: 
    
   Case A: Non-hierarchical VPNÆs: QoS is end-to-end in the ppvpn 
   cloud, from VPN Endpoint to VPN Endpoint in the PEÆs; 
    
   Case B: Hierarchical VPNÆs: QoS is from VPN Endpoint in the MTU to 
   VPN Endpoint in the MTU.

   In this document, the "service model" is defined as the service 
   specification and its QoS attributes together to carry traffic 
   between two end-points in a network. The end-point is also the 
   Service Access Point (SAP). \ The services are specified through a 
   Service Level Specification (SLS) that is described in Section 3.5. 
    
3.1.2.  Reference models 
    
   Case A: Non-hierarchical VPNÆs 
    
   Case A.1: Point-to-Point 
    
        This is straightforward. QoS is between the two endpoints, it 
        is a QoS pipe with specified characteristics. No other cases 
        are possible. This is illustrated in the following figure.

        Note that the following scenario is just a special case of the 
        previous one (i.e., as far as QoS is concerned, it is 
        multipoint even if there is only one VC in the network; in 
        fact, the customer does not care if his/her VPN endpoints are 
        in the same PE or not; he/she just wants QoS):

        In the multipoint scenario, several VPN topologies are 
        relevant. They include: 
        - Mesh of tunnels between nodes 
        - Hub-n-Spoke: shared tunnels in the VPN 
        - Other topologies (sink trees, etc.) 
                 
        With multipoint, we need to make the distinction between pipe 
        or hose models. Three cases are possible. 
    
        A. PIPE MODEL 
        The QoS specification is per pair of VPN endpoints. A special 
        case is one where the specifications between all pairs of 
        endpoints are homogeneous, in which case the QoS specifications 
        are given between any pair of endpoints. The provider will most 
        likely offer a small number of templates of QoS specifications, 
        otherwise it can become very complex to specify QoS.  
         
        The pipe model requires that for each new customer site on a PE, 
        a <traffic filter, profile> pair be configured between it and 
        every other remote site for that customer on every PE. Thus if 
        the number of sites for a customer is N, for every new site 
        provisioned at a PE, 2N pairs of filter,profile will need to be 
        configured. There need to be means and ways of reducing this 
        overhead. The hose model avoids these issues. Single-sided 
        signalling is another way of avoiding these issues.

        This is the only model that guarantees control of what can be 
        provided on a per pair basis. Fairness can be provided in this 
        model. 
    
        To guarantee QoS in this model, there is the need to identify 
        endpoints in this model, in order to distinguish traffic 
        destined to different endpoints residing in the same PE. See 
        Section 3.2 for a discussion of the issue of identification of 
        endpoints. 
      
        B. HOSE MODEL 
        Pure hose just specifies the QoS characteristics at the 
        demarcation point(s) between CE and PE. 
    
        The hose model does not need the identification of endpoints.  
         
        At Layer 2, what specified in [Lasserre] is adequate to support 
        QoS in this model.  
         
        An open issue in this model is the detailed allocation of 
        resources for the VPN inside the network. More to be added in 
        future versions of this document.  
    
        C. MIXED HOSE & PIPE MODEL 
        In this case, for a given VPN, there is a pipe between PEÆs, 
        but multiple endpoints residing in the same PE share the 
        pipe(s).  
         
        Identification of endpoints is not needed. At Layer 2, what 
        specified in [Lasserre] is adequate to support QoS in this 
        model. 
         
        The hose model is within the VPN. A given VPN has pipes 
        allocated between PEÆs and then members of the VPN share the 
        pipes. This model is quite meaningful, since it looks very much 
        like what would happen in a LAN. Indeed, in this model, if 
        somebody is not getting the desired QoS, it is because of 
        misbehavior of some other members in that VPN, not because of 
        misbehavior of somebody outside the VPN. 
    
        To the customer, pure hose model and mixed hose and pipe model 
        must look the same, since the customer is unaware of whether 
        endpoints share the same PE or not. The provider may use the 
        mixed hose and pipe model to provide QoS. In this case, the 
        provider needs to properly aggregate resources for the shared 
        pipes in order to provide QoS. Again, an open issue in case of 
        hose specifications, is the sizing of the pipes to meet those 
        specifications.

       Pipe and hose models have to be able to coexist in the same 
       network, since they appeal to different types of customers, and 
       can correspond to services with different price points.

                              --       -- 
        
       A primary motivation for this scenario is the desire of not 
       identifying the endpoints in the MTUÆs (for scalability). As a 
       consequence, it is naturally suited for the hose model. What 
       specified in [Lasserre] is adequate to support QoS in this case. 
    
       Load balancing is not possible in this scenario, since the fact 
       that the same CE is connected to two different MTUÆs is totally 
       hidden in the network.

       Again, hose and pipe model should coexist in this configuration. 
       In the case of pipe model, the endpoints have to be identified, 
       which would decrease scalability. Still, different customers 
       have different requirements and one model cannot not fit all. In 
       case of identification of endpoints, [Lasserre] needs to be tied 
       with an approach like the one in [Lau]. 
    
       There is an intermediate possibility of identifying the 
       endpoints in the PEÆs and not identifying those in the MTUÆs, 
       ending up with hose model from MTUÆs to PEÆs, and pipes 
       connecting endpoints in the PEÆs. This hybrid scenario does not 
       seem to make too much sense and is not further considered in 
       this document. 
    
3.2.    VPN Endpoints (Service Access Point) Identification  
    
   The identification of endpoints is most relevant in Layer 2 VPNÆs. 
   The identification of endpoints has implications on inner label 
   distribution (for example, unsolicited on demand does not work). 
   Identification of endpoints reduces scalability (larger number of VC 
   labels, more signaling). 
    
   The need of identification of endpoints constitutes a major 
   difference in performing resource allocation for Layer 2 vs. Layer 3 
   PPVPNs. In Layer 3 VPNs, the demarcation point between the customer 
   and the provider-network can be identified by a private or public IP 
   address. As such, existing IP resource reservation models/signaling 
   protocols, i.e. Diff-Serv, Int-Serv,  MP-BGP, RSVP RSVP-TE, LDP, CR-
   LDP  can be readily applied to perform resource reservation between 
   the customer/provider demarcation points. This is NOT the case for 
   Layer 2 VPNs, where the demarcation point between the customer and 
   the provider network is a Layer 2 endpoint which usually does not 
   have an associated private/public IP address.  
    
   As such, most existing resource reservation schemes for Layer 2 VPNs 
   have been focused on the resource reservation for the ingress-PE-to-
   egress-PE outer-tunnel(s) ,while the signaling of the resource 
   reservation for inner VCs, particularly inside and across the 
   ingress and egress PEs has not been addressed.  
    
   This is also due to the fact that most Layer 2 VPN proposals, e.g. 
   [Martini-TRANS], [Lasserre], have limited themselves to cover only 
   Best-Effort Layer 2 VPNs.  
    
   It is therefore necessary to (1) establish a  widely accepted   
   L2VPN endpoint identifiers and (2) provide extensions in existing L3 
   resource reservation model/ signaling protocols to incorporate such 
   L2VPN endpoint identifiers.

   For instance, in the case of MPLS-based L2VPNs,  Layer 2 VPN 
   endpoints are associated with new types of MPLS Forwarding 
   Equivalent Classes, e.g. the VC-FEC proposed by [Martini-TRANS] and 
   the MTU-FEC proposed by the recent [Lasserre] and [Shah] approaches. 
   While such new types of FECs have been defined by various drafts, 
   the extensions to incorporate them into the related signaling 
   protocols have been sporadic at best, e.g. extensions of RSVP-TE to 
   support VC-FEC or MTU-FEC have received very little, if any, 
   attention so far.   
   Such extensions are essential to allow us to unify the resource 
   reservation model/ mechanisms for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 PPVPNs. 
    
3.3.    QoS guarantees in PPVPNs 
    
   This section defines the various QoS service parameters and their 
   guarantees. 
    
   * Bandwidth guarantees 
        The services can be specified with and without (best-effort) 
        bandwidth guarantees. When a service model has a associated 
        bandwidth parameters, the service provider makes sure that 
        enough bandwidth is provisioned within the network (using any 
        model, point-to-point or hub-and-spoke). Generally the 
        guarantees are specified and policed against certain traffic 
        models. For example, Diff-Serv allows the traffic specification 
        as a Single rate or Two rate traffic parameters, that have 
        associated parameters. 
         
        o Based on Diff-Serv models (srTCM, trTCM) 
                * Single Rate: CIR, CBS, EBS 
                This model guarantees an average rate of CIR to the 
                service with certain burst tolerances specified by CBS 
                and EBS. The traffic policer/marker based on single rate 
                (srTCM) can mark the traffic as green, yellow or red 
                depending on the traffic conformance to the 
                specification.  
                * Two Rate: CIR, CBS, PIR, PBS 
                This model allows a burst tolerance to both average 
                (CIR) and peak (PIR) of the traffic. The two rate 
                marker/policer (trTCM) can mark the traffic as green, 
                yellow and red depending on the traffic conformance to 
                the specification. 
                 
        o Examples of ranges and granularities 
                     o 1Mb/s min service granularity 
    
   * Delay guarantees 
        Delay is a measure of maximum packet transfer delay between the 
        ingress and egress SAPs. Delay can be specified as worst case 
        bound or as a quantile.

                * Based on Diff-serv EF model for High-priority traffic 
                * Based on Average RED thresholds 
                * Based on number of hops  
         
        o Examples of ranges and granularities 
    
   * Jitter guarantees 
        Jitter is a measure of packet delay variation encountered for 
        packets when they are transferred between ingress and egress 
        SAPs. Jitter can be specified as a worst-case bound or as a 
        quantile. 
         
        o Examples 
    
   * Other guarantees 
    
   * Packet Loss 
        Packet loss is specified as a probability. It is defined as the 
        ratio of lost packets between ingress and egress SAP to the 
        total packets received at the ingress SAP. 
         
        o Packet Loss per-class, per-VPN 
    
        o Aggregate Packet Loss measure for Multipoint 
    
   * Fairness 
    
   * Administrative  
    
   * Availability, Reporting, and Restoration 
        o 100% (1+1), Restoration < t 
    
   * Best effort traffic in PPVPN 
        o Multiple priorities 
    
3.4.    VPN Service Level Specification (SLS)  
    
3.4.1.  SLS structure 
 
   A generic Service Level Specification template (SLS) is proposed in 
   [SLS]. This SLS template is assumed to be the elementary building 
   block of the SLS that is offered by the Service Provider to his 
   customer. 
    
   A VPN SLS is assumed to be a combination of several instances of the 
   SLS template. 
    
3.4.2.  Layer 3 SLS template

                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
   We briefly summarize the different parts of the SLS template that 
   were defined in [SLS]. 
    
   Scope 
    
   The scope of an SLS uniquely identifies the geographical/topological 
   region over which the QoS is to be enforced by indicating the 
   boundaries of that region. Although an SLS is associated with uni-
   directional traffic flows, this does not exclude the provisioning by 
   providers of bi-directional transport service contracts, by 
   combining one or more SLSs. Valid combinations in the context of VPN 
   contracts are Pipe (1,1), Hose (1,N) and Funnel (N,1). 
    
   Flow Description 
    
   The flow description of an SLS indicates for which IP packets the 
   QoS guarantees for that specific service offering is to be enforced.  
   An SLS contains one (and only one) flow description, which may be 
   specified by providing one or more of the following attributes: 
   - Differentiated Services information 
   - Source information 
   - Destination information 
   - Application information 
   In case of MF-classification all attributes may be specified, 
   including the DSCP field. 
    
   Traffic Envelope and Traffic Conformance 
    
   The traffic envelope describes the traffic (conformance) 
   characteristics of the IP packet stream identified by the flow 
   description. The traffic envelope is a set of Traffic Conformance 
   Parameters, describing what the packet stream should look like to 
   get the guarantees indicated by the performance parameters (defined 
   in section 3.3). 
    
   Excess Treatment 
    
   Excess traffic may be dropped, shaped and/or remarked. The SLS must 
   specify the appropriate action by the Excess Treatment attribute. If 
   Excess Treatment is not indicated, then excess traffic is dropped. 
    
   Performance Guarantees 
    
   The performance parameters describe the service guarantees the 
   network offers to the customer for the packet stream described by 
   the flow description and over the geographical/topological extent 
   given by the scope. There are four performance parameters: 
   o    delay, time interval, optional quantile 
   o    jitter, time interval, optional quantile 
   o    packet loss, time interval 
   o    throughput, time interval

                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
    
   Delay, jitter and packet loss guarantees are for the in-profile 
   traffic in case of binary conformance testing.  
   If none of the SLS performance parameters are quantified, then the 
   performance parameters "delay" and "packet loss" may be "qualified". 
   Possible qualitative values (for delay and/or loss): high, medium, 
   low. 
    
   Measurement and reporting 
    
   The monitoring and reporting section of the SLS specifies when and 
   how QoS performance needs to be monitored and reported. This section 
   may include: 
    
   - Reporting address: Address of the entity to which performance 
   reports need to be sent 
    
   - For each performance parameter, the following may be specified: 
        o measurement interval 
        o reporting type 
        o notification threshold 
    
   - For the availability parameters, the SLS may contain: 
        o total number of outages 
        o total outage time 
        o maximum allowed mean downtime per year (MDT) 
        o maximum allowed time to repair (TTR) 
    
   Availability 
    
   The availability of the offered network service needs to be related 
   to the protection and restoration options that are available in the 
   network. We propose the following availability categories: 
   - unprotected: no protection guaranteed 
   - restored: service interruption <10s 
   - protected: service interruption <1s 
   - fast protected: service interruption <100ms 
    
   The availability of the VPN also depends on the specific VPN model 
   that is used. It needs to be clearly indicated if the availability 
   guarantees apply to the complete VPN, or only to the hub or spoke in 
   a hub-and-spoke VPN. 
    
   Service schedule 
    
   The service schedule indicates the start time and end time of the 
   service, i.e. when is the service available. This might be expressed 
   as collection of the following parameters: 
   - Time of the day range 
   - Day of the week range 
   - Month of the year range

3.4.3.  Layer 2 SLS template 
 
   The Layer 2 SLS template is TBC. 
 
3.4.4.  SLS example  
    
   The picture below gives an example of a VPN with three attached 
   sites A, B and C, each of which can send or receive a certain amount 
   of traffic into the VPN. 
    
   +---+  50 Mb/s +-------------------+  20 Mb/s +---+

                  |                   | 
                  +-------------------+

                           |  30 Mb/s 
                           v 
                         +---+ 
                         + C + 
                         +---+ 
    
   In the case of a full mesh VPN model, the SLS contract would consist 
   of three hose SLS instances: 
   - a hose with root A and capacity 50 Mb/s, with restrictions on the 
   egress points B (20 Mb/s) and C (30 Mb/s) 
   - a hose with root B and capacity 20 Mb/s 
   - a hose with root C and capacity 30 Mb/s, with a restriction on the 
   egress point B (20 Mb/s) 
    
   In the case of a hub-and-spoke model, the latter two hose SLSs would 
   be replaced by pipe SLSs with capacity 20 Mb/s and 30 Mb/s 
   respectively.

   Different Legs in the resource reservation path of a PPVPN

   also the starting point(s) of the per VPN inner VC(s) 
    
   o Inside the ingress PE, resource are reserved at the per inner VC 
   level of granularity. The inner VC level resource requirements can 
   either be provided to the ingress PE via configuration or they may 
   be extracted from an UNI-signaling protocol, if any, which is  
   initiated from the customer and terminated at the ingress PE.  Once

   resource requirements should preferably be signaled to the  egress 
   PE. 
      
   o Network facing port of the ingress PE û this is also the starting 
   point of the ôingress PE to egress PEö outer-tunnel ; 
   Multiple per VPN inner VCs having the same pair of ingress/egress 
   PEs are aggregated / multiplexed into the same outer-tunnel. [Also 
   need to consider the case where multiple parallel outer-tunnels are 
   used to connect between the same ingress/egress PE pair for fault-
   tolerant, traffic-engineering and load-balancing purpose.]    
    
   o Path through the core network --- resource requirements of per-VPN 
   VCs are aggregated and reserved at the outer-tunnel level such that 
   the inner VCs are not visible in the core network.  The step-size of 
   resource allocation/deallocation for an outer tunnel should be 
   bigger than the requirement of  an individual VC to introduce 
   hysteresis effect and reduce the frequency of adjusting outer-tunnel 
   resource allocation level as inner VCs are setup and tear-down. This 
   is essential for reducing signaling load and thus increasing 
   signaling scalability in the core network.  
    
   Schemes such as those defined in RFC3075 and the Hierarchical LSP-
   draft can be used for signaling/ maintaining aggregation of inner 
   VCs into outer tunnels. In particular, if RSVP-TE is used for 
   signaling the changes of outer-tunnel resource-reservation, RSVP-
   TEÆs requirement of make-before-break would almost mean the setup of 
   a replacement outer-tunnel upon changes in resource reservation 
   level. Moreover, the make-before-break mechanism in most cases also 
   implies changes of outer-tunnel label values for a large number of 
   inner VCs at the ingress PE û some form of indirection is desirable 
   to speedup/reduce the overhead required to update a large number of 
   outer-tunnel /inner-VC label-pair at the PE.  
       
   o Network facing port of the egress PE û this is the termination 
   point of the outer tunnel (although the actual outer-tunnel label 
   may have been removed by the penultimate hop already). The inner VCs 
   carried by the outer tunnel are demultiplexed from the outer tunnel 
   and become visible again. In the case where penultimate-hop-popping 
   is performed for the outer tunnel label, additional mechanism is 
   needed to create/maintain/signal the binding between an inner VC and 
   its outer tunnel in the egress PE.  
    
   The creation of this binding is missing in a lot existing cases, as 
   different mechanisms/ signaling protocols are used to setup the 
   outer-tunnel and inner VCs separately, e.g. in MPLS-based L2VPN, 
   outer-tunnels are setup using RSVP-TE while the inner VCs are setup 
   using an extended version of LDP based on the Martini draft. The 
   binding are particularly useful during outer-tunnel re-routing/ re-
   establishment where the ingress port/ line-card of the egress PE for 
   the outer-tunnel may have changed as a result of re-routing and the 
   resource allocation for the inner VCs carried by the re-routed outer

   tunnel would need to be moved from the original ingress port to the 
   new one. Unless the binding between the outer-tunnel and its inner 
   VCs are kept by the egress PE, such movement would require operator 
   intervention and thus ruin the chance of end-to-end fast re-
   routing/restoration of PPVPN service.  
    
   o Inside the egress PE, resource are reserved at the per inner VC 
   level of granularity. 
    
   o Each inner VC is then terminated at its customer-facing port of 
   the egress PE. 
    
4.2.    Aggregated models and non-aggregated models 
    
   Guarantees to individual users vs. guarantees to aggregates 
    
   Specify what is needed in both approaches. Describe different 
   scheduling frameworks: 
    
   1. Per flow scheduling and conditioning at the edges, limited 
   scheduling in the cloud (diff-serv) to achieve guarantees to 
   aggregates 
    
   2. Per flow scheduling everywhere (int-serv) to achieve guarantees 
   to individual users. (Is anybody really doing this?) 
    
   3. Per flow scheduling and conditioning at the edges, elaborate 
   scheduling on aggregates in the cloud to achieve guarantees to 
   individual users (how do we call this?) 
    
   How are priority schemes (802.1p) supported. Specify scheduling 
   framework needed. 
 
   Guarantees per aggregate need to coexist with guarantees to 
   individual customers. 
    
   Individual connections have to coexist with tunneled connections. 
   This is not so difficult, since individual connections are a special 
   case of tunneled connections. 
    
4.3.    QoS OF the VPN, QoS WITHIN the VPN 
    
   A given VPN may correspond to a single level of QoS. Alternatively, 
   a customer may want to send different type of traffic within the 
   same VPN, and the network needs to support each type, while 
   maintaining the notion of VPN 
    
   Even if the customer sees the VPN with multiple levels of QoS as a 
   single VPN, the provider may accomplish it by establishing a single 
   VPN, or by having multiple VPNÆs and grouping them.

   Three solutions are possible. 
    
   1. Provider establishes one VPN, there is a single tunnel between 
   endpoints, but there is scheduling and conditioning of the traffic 
   components at the edges. This is adequate in many, but not all 
   cases. 
    
   2. Provider establishes one VPN, but there are multiple tunnels 
   between endpoints, one per desired level of QoS. 
    
   3. Provider establishes one VPN per desired level of QoS, and then 
   somehow groups the VPNÆs so they look like a single one to the 
   customer. 
    
   The issue with grouping is the broadcast domain, it needs to 
   broadcast on only one of the levels. Also learning is an issue, it 
   needs to learn across the VPNÆs in the same group. 
    
4.4.    TE, QoS Routing and PPVPNÆs 
    
   This section will be completed in future versions of this document. 
    
   What is specific of PPVPNÆs in terms of TE? 
   TE can happen at different levels: 
   1. per VPN, per endpoint pair 
   2. per VPN, per aggregate 
   3. per class 
   Advertising of resource availability over the network is per class. 
   Identification of endpoints allows for better TE.

   Couple/decouple learning and QoS treatment 
         
4.5.2.  Marking issues 
                         
   Currently this section focuses only on MPLS tunnels. If both VPN 
   tunnels and end-point tunnels use either RSVP-TE or CR-LDP and use 
   E-LSPs for tunnel setup, the EXP bits must be appropriately marked 
   in both labels. If the end-point tunnels are setup using Martini 
   type encapsulation, then the inner label doesn't carry any EXP bits 
   but the outer label must be appropriately marked using any L2 
   classification rules, priority bits in 802.1p/q. Generally most L2 
   connectivity requires sequenced packet delivery (no out of order 
   packets) and preserved QoS marking. While QoS marking can be easily 
   preserved, L2 packet sequence cannot be guaranteed when transported 
   using MPLS tunnels due to different QoS treatment needs. For now, it

   is assumed that there are mechanisms (outside the scope of this 
   document) in the network to preserve L2 packet order. Various such 
   tunneling models can co-exist in the context of PPVPN and it is 
   assumed that the labels are appropriately marked at the edges to get 
   the QoS treatment needed in the network.

   (To be added in future versions of this document.) 
 
4.6. Specific QoS issues 
    
   This section lists QoS issues that only pertain to a specific VPN 
   solution. 
 
4.6.1.  QoS in RFC 2547 VPNÆs 
         
   (To be added in future versions of this document.) 
    
   RFC2547 provides VPNs using the piggy-backing model where the VPN 
   Network Layer terminates at the backbone edge and BGP is used to 
   exchange VPN membership and reachability information amongst PEs.  
 
4.6.2.  QoS in VR VPNÆs 
                 
   Virtual Router (VR) is a popular model used to provide VPN services. 
   VPN data and routing information between VRs is tunnelled using 
   either IP-based or MPLS-based tunnels. The tunnels appear to the VRs 
   as a point-to-point link. QoS mechanisms such as traffic filters, 
   policers and markers can be applied against traffic entering the VR 
   from the customer site. If an MPLS RSVP-based tunnel is used between 
   VRs, the service quality on the LSP can be assured via admission 
   control. In all such cases, it is necessary for the administrator to 
   configure the traffic profile and filter on a per connection basis 
   between VRs.  
    
   The issues are essentially the same as for L2 based VPNs. Should 
   there be a desire to automate the transfer of traffic profiles and 
   filters, protocol extensions to BGP would be required.

5. QoS Provisioning of the VPN Endpoints in the PEÆs 
    
   (This section will be expanded in future versions of this document to 
   cover IPSec, L2TP, and GRE VPNÆs) 
 
   This section covers the provisioning required at the VPN endpoints on 
   the PEs in order to provide QoS across the provider network. It does 
   not cover the provisioning of the underlying tunneling topology. 
    
5.1.   Provisioning models 
    
   Prior to defining the provisioning parameters, it is useful to 
   identify the provisioning parameters. We initially consider a service 
   that is based on an MPLS-based provider network. We will consider IP-
   based tunnels subsequently. We will initially consider both the pipe 
   and the hose models. 
    
5.1.1.  Pipe Model 
    
   In the pipe model, as mentioned above, it is assumed that there is 
   some kind QoS assurance from the customer-facing port on the ingress 
   PE to the customer-facing port on the egress PE. For simplicity, if 
   there are multiple sites for a given customer connecting to the same 
   PE, each of these would be considered to have a separate pipe for the 
   purposes of QoS. Initially also, we consider that there is only a 
   single customer site per customer-facing port on a PE. The case where 
   multiple customer traffic is aggregated on a single such port will be 
   considered in subsequent versions of this document. 
    
   In the Layer 2 VC for the pipe model, there are 2 key QoS attributes 
   that should be provisioned at each VPN end-point. These attributes 
   will apply against a VC LSP or ôpipeö between 2 VPN sites: 
    
     * Traffic Filter 
     * Traffic Profile 
 
   In order to understand the provisioning model and subsequently define 
   required signaling extensions, it is useful to capture a rough high-
   level view of the data model. One such model could resemble the 
   following:

   |------------||-------------------------------||--------------------| 
    
   Traffic coming from particular interfaces are recognized as belonging 
   to a particular customer VPN. Based on L2 MAC learning, the 
   destination VPNSiteID is identified. If the service in question is a 
   simple point-to-point service then mapping from VPN_ID to VPNSiteID 
   is easily achieved. Otherwise, after identification of the VPN that a 
   packet belongs to, a lookup of the MAC table is required in order to 
   determine which particular VPN site this packet is destined for. If a 
   model is utilized where learning and forwarding decisions for a 
   packet are performed both on ingress and egress PEs then the QoS 
   assurance will of necessity not be between 2 customer sites but 
   between a single customer site and all the sites for its VPN that 
   connect to a remote PE. For simplicity, we assume that there exists a 
   VC LSP that represents a ôpipeö between a particular customer site on 
   an ingress PE and a counterpart unique customer site off a remote PE. 
    
   Once the VPNSite has been identified, then a traffic filter will be 
   applied against the incoming packet and the traffic characteristics 
   for that traffic profile updated. In keeping with the Diff-serv 
   architecture, the output of the meter will be compared against a pre-
   configured traffic profile for that pipe. The output is a DSCP value 
   to be applied against the packet. 
    
   -- Issues for the Pipe Model 
    
        The data model in the previous section identifies that for a 
        specific customer on a particular PE, the operator when 
        configuring the VPN attributes for that customer site will also 
        configure QoS attributes for every pipe from that customer to 
        its remote customer sites.  
    
        There are a number of issues to be considered in this regard: 
    
        * The first issue QoS issue relates to symmetry. The first 
        question for an MPLS-based cloud in L2 PPVPN is whether the VC 
        LSP will have symmetrical filters and traffic profiles on either 
        end of the ôpipeö. If it is symmetrical, then when a new site is 
        added to the VPN, and the mesh of LSPs are established, the 
        remote points can be provisioned using an automated signaling 
        mechanism. Thus, the operator would download a set of filter and 
        traffic profile between this new VPN site and all its peers û 
        this downloading is only done once at the new site. Signaling 
        then propagates this information to the remote site. The remote 
     
                Informational - Expires December 2002              29 
                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
        ends then install the filter and traffic profile to be applied 
        against traffic originating from the remote end to the PE that 
        sent it the profiles. If the filter and profiles are the same 
        for traffic in both directions then this is symmetrical and 
        easily achieved. However, in some cases, the filter and traffic 
        profile for the remote end may be different from the local vpn 
        site. Thus, automated signaling becomes more of an question 
        mark. Either the operator has to download a filter and traffic 
        profile at both ends of the VC LSP or it downloads the 2 
        different filter/traffic profile at a single end and it is 
        automatically signaled to the remote VPN site. This is like the 
        single-ended model of provisioning. This case is referred to as 
        the asymmetrical case. 
    
        The second issue relates to the complexity. In order to assure 
        QoS in the pipe model, when a new CE site is provisioned on the 
        PE, it is necessary to download a traffic filter and traffic 
        profile for the VC connection to every remote customer site in 
        that customerÆs VPN. To simplify this, the operator may wish to 
        initially provision the same size ôpipesö between all customer 
        sites and later modify the traffic profile for customer ôpipesö 
        depending on observed traffic patterns between specific customer 
        sites. 
    
        The third issue relates to the ability to uniquely identify both 
        ends of a ôpipeö. This is discussed in Section 3.2 above. 
    
5.1.2.  Hose Model 
    
   The Hose Model can benefit from the same mechanisms and extensions as 
   the Pipe model. However, there are a number of key differences and 
   simplifications: 
    
   * When adding a new customer site, it is not necessary to download 
   traffic filters and profiles for traffic destined to every single 
   other customer site. Instead, if this is the first site for this 
   customer on the PE, a filter and traffic profile can be downloaded. 
   Later, as new sites are added for the same customer on this PE, the 
   traffic profile may be adjusted to account for the changed traffic 
   that will enter the network for this customer. In the hose model, 
   there is no need to transmit any information to customer sites on 
   remote PE for QoS purposes. 
    
    
5.2.   Provisioning parameters 
    
5.2.1.  Traffic Filter 
    
   The following are some of the Traffic Filter fields to be considered 
   for transmission to the remote PE: source IP, destination IP, DSCP, 
   802.1Q bits, destination port, source port, destination port mask,

   source port mask, protocol. These fields should be based on the 
   capabilities of classification mechanisms that will be present on 
   PEs. 
    
5.2.2.  Traffic Profile 
    
   The Traffic Profile fields should interoperate with various pre-
   defined Diffserv policers such as srTCM, trTCM and tswTCM. Thus, this 
   would include: cir, pir etc û the complete list would be taken from 
   the Diffserv MIB which has recently been standardized. 
    
5.2.3.  Unique Identification of Pipe End-Point 
    
   Either there is a need to ensure that the VCid as in [Lasserre] is 
   redefined as in [Lau] or a replacement field is required. 
    
5.3.Management of QoS VPN 
    
   In order to facilitate network management of VPNs from a QoS 
   perspective consideration needs to be given to protocol extensions 
   required. MIB extensions are needed. At this point it is unclear 
   whether to develop an entirely new MIB or try to reuse parts of the 
   Diffserv MIB and other PPVPN MIBs that may emerge.  
 
6. QoS Signaling in PPVPNÆs 
 
   In general, PPVPN can be established using various PE-to-PE 
   tunneling technologies including MPLS, L2TP, IP-in-IP, IPsec as well 
   as GRE. Given our objective of supporting PPVPN services with QoS 
   guarantees, we will focus our discussions on MPLS tunneling alone 
   due to the existence of scalable MPLS-based solutions in resource 
   reservation, QoS signaling and traffic engineering. We only mention 
   in passing that the subject of QoS support has not been treated in 
   any detail in the recent Internet drafts [PPVPN-L2TP, PE-IPSEC, PE-
   GRE] regarding the other PE-to-PE tunneling technologies.  
    
6.1.    Resource Reservation tasks for PPVPNs 
    
   Recall from Section 4 that, in order to provide QoS guarantees in a 
   PPVPN, resource reservation has to be performed  (a) within the 
   ingress and egress PEs hosting endpoints and (b) for the PE-to-PE 
   outer tunnels as they traverse the provider network. While resource 
   reservation for the outer tunnels are usually done at an aggregated 
   level where individual VC (aka pseudo-wire or emulated virtual 
   circuit) requirements become invisible, resource allocation within 
   the ingress/egress PE is usually done at a finer granularity. For 
   instance, for point-to-point L2 pseudo-wire service, this is done at 
   a per VC level granularity; for RFC2547 L3VPNs, bandwidth 
   reservation can be performed  at  a per L3VPN endpoint basis ; for 
   VPLS, this can be done  at a per L2VPN endpoint basis. [This 
   actually corresponds to allocate bandwidth to each logical port of a

   Virtual Forwarding Switch (VFS) within a PE hosting one or more 
   endpoints of the corresponding L2VPN.]  
    
    
6.2.    "Partial" QoS signaling approach taken by Existing proposals 
    
   Most of the existing PPVPN architectures, including RFC2547 L3VPNs, 
   Martini-based L2VPNs [Martini-ENC, Martini-TRANS, Lasserre], as well 
   as BGP/MPLS-based L2VPN proposals [Rosen, Kompella], have limited 
   their use of QoS/ resource-reservation signaling protocol, typically 
   RSVP-TE or CR-LDP, to the setup of PE-to-PE tunnels only. While 
   signaling protocols such as LDP and BGP (with appropriate PPVPN 
   extensions) are used for setting up basic connectivity within the 
   VPN (by distributing the corresponding VC labels together with VPN 
   endpoint reachability information), resource allocations/ 
   reservations within the ingress/egress PEs are left for manual 
   provisioning instead.  In fact, the current PPVPN extensions for LDP 
   as specified in [Martini-TRANS, Single-sided] and those for BGP as 
   specified in [MP-BGP] cannot even associate any QoS attribute with 
   the MPLS-labels or VPN reachability/ endpoint information that they 
   distribute. By restricting the use of resource reservation signaling 
   to the setting up of PE-to-PE outer tunnels, additional PPVPN-
   specific extensions of the resource reservation protocols, i.e. 
   RSVP-TE or CR-LDP, can be avoided. This is because the inner VCs as 
   well as their corresponding VPN endpoints are invisible to the 
   resource reservation protocol during the setup of the outer tunnel.  
   As far as RSVP-TE or CR-LDP is concerned, its task is to setup an 
   LSP with QoS requirement between the loopback IP addresses of the 
   ingress/ egress PEs without involving any PPVPN specifics. This 
   results in the dependence on manual provisioning for VC-level 
   resource reservations within the PEs, which eventually prevents the 
   support of truly single-sided provisioning. The situation is 
   particularly true under the pipe-QoS-model: Consider the case where 
   a change of VC-level resource allocation is needed at a remote PE 
   due to the addition/removal of a VPN endpoint in a local PE. Without 
   resource reservation/ QoS signaling support at the VC-level between 
   the PEs, manual provisioning/ human intervention will be required 
   for both the local and remote PEs.  Arguably, the hose-QoS model may 
   be less affected if one accepts the assumption that, under the hose 
   model, resource allocation for each VPN endpoint should remain 
   unchanged as additional endpoints are added to/ removed from the 
   same VPN.    
    
   Another drawback of the current "partial" QoS signaling approach is 
   that outer tunnel labels and inner VC labels are usually 
   distributed/ signaled by different protocols, e.g. using  
   RSVP-TE for distributing outer labels while LDP or BGP is used for 
   distributing the inner ones. The use of multiple signaling protocols 
   for label distribution not only increases operational complexity but 
   may also lead to difficulties in fault detection/ management. For 
   example, the LDP connection and outer-tunnel of a VC may traverse

   through different paths in the provider network.  The failure in 
   one, but not both, of these paths may put the VC to an inconsistent 
   failure state.  
    
   The use of different signaling protocols for outer and inner label 
   distribution has also make it difficult to signal an egress PE the 
   binding information between an outer-tunnel and its component VCs.  
   In fact, all of the existing PPVPN QoS signaling schemes described 
   above does not provide such binding. In particular, if penultimate 
   hop popping is used, it is impossible for the destination PE to 
   determine the outer tunnel of a given VC. Notice that such binding 
   information can be very useful when an outer-tunnel is automatically 
   re-routed to a different ingress interface of the destination PE, 
   e.g., to circumvent a failure inside the provider network, and the 
   corresponding VC-level resource within the egress PE have to be 
   relocated accordingly. As a beginning step in this direction, [Cai] 
   has proposed extensions to use RSVP-TE for both VC and outer tunnel 
   setup in L2VPNs. However, this work has gathered little attention so 
   far. Moreover, the mandate in [Martini2] of using LDP for VC-label 
   distribution may need to be revisited in order to allow for the use 
   of other VC-label distribution protocols to realize better 
   coordination between inner and outer label distribution and binding.   
    
6.3.    Towards Full QoS signaling support for PPVPNs 
    
   It should be obvious by now that, in order to support truly single-
   sided provisioning for PPVPN with QoS guarantees, QoS/ resource 
   reservation signaling should support not only PE-to-PE outer tunnel 
   setup but also VC-level resource reservation within the PEs. Towards 
   this end, existing MPLS-based resource reservation protocols, e.g., 
   RSVP-TE and CR-LDP, would require PPVPN-specific extensions in the 
   following areas:  
     
   6.3.1.  Signaling of VPN endpoint identifiers   
    
   For L2VPNs, candidate VPN endpoint identifiers/ structures to be 
   considered include (1) the attachment endpoint identifiers (AEI) / 
   group index proposed in [Single-sided], and (2) the VC-FEC TLV in 
   [Martini-TRANS] with the generalized semantics of the VCID field as 
   specified in [Lau]. Notice that, in order to support MAC address 
   learning in MPLS-based L2VPNs (such as that required by VPLS), it is 
   desirable for VC-setup signaling messages, i.e. Label 
   Request/Mapping ones, to carry both the source as well as the 
   destination VPN endpoint identifiers associated with a VC. (This is 
   because, in MPLS-based L2VPNs, MAC address learning is performed by 
   first establishing the binding between the source MAC address and 
   the VC-label carried by a packet. The ingress VPN endpoint of the 
   packet can then be derived based on the VC-label carried by the 
   packet using the mapping between an VC-label and its source 
   (ingress) VPN endpoint which is created during the setup of VC.) 
   Towards this end, it is noteworthy that the RSVP-TE extensions

                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
   proposed by [Cai] as well as the LDP extensions proposed by 
   [Martini-TRANS] and [Lasserre] do not include the ingress VPN 
   endpoint identifier of a VC in the label distribution messages. As 
   such, remote MAC address learning can only resolve the source PE, as 
   well as the VPN i.d. of a packet. In the case where a PE hosts 
   multiple endpoints of the same L2VPN, additional local bridging 
   based on local learning information has to be performed to resolve 
   the destination VPN endpoint of a packet. By hiding multiple 
   endpoints of the same VPN hosted by a PE from other remote PEs, 
   these schemes achieve better signaling scalability at the expense of 
   disallowing signaling support for the true pipe-QoS-model in which 
   end-to-end QoS signaling between any pair of endpoints within a VPN 
   would be required.     
 
    
   For L3VPNs, a VPN-endpoint can be identified by concatenating a 
   route-distinguisher with the private IP address associated with the 
   endpoint, following the approach taken by RFC2547.  Once the 
   representation/construct for VPN endpoint identifiers is decided, 
   resource reservation protocols such as RSVP-TE and/or CR-LDP should 
   be extended to carry both the source and destination VPN endpoint 
   identifiers associated with the VC to be setup. For instance, the 
   LDP FEC element specified in Section 4.2 of [Single-sided] can 
   readily be carried over to a CR-LDP extension to support the source/ 
   destination VPN attachment endpoint identifiers in [Single-sided]. 
   Similarly, new RSVP objects can be introduced along the line of 
   [Cai] to extend RSVP-TE to carry both source and destination VPN 
   endpoint identifiers of a VC.  
    
    
   6.3.2. Coordinating VC and Outer Tunnel QoS Signaling 
    
   To increase network manageability, as well as for reasons explained 
   above, it is desirable to use the same signaling protocol for 
   setting up an VC and its outer tunnel.  When explicit VC-level 
   resource-reservation/allocation is required at a PE, it is also 
   useful to signal the binding of an outer tunnel and the VCs it 
   carries between the ingress/egress PE. Signaling scalability can 
   also be further enhanced by using the resource aggregation 
   mechanisms similar to those specified in [RSVP-AGG] and Section 7 of 
   [LSP-HIE], i.e. to tunnel VC-level reservation/refreshes between the 
   ingress and egress PE via the outer tunnel provided that PPVPN-
   specific extensions are incorporated in the corresponding 
   reservation protocols. For instance, extension of signaling messages 
   to carry the necessary VPN endpoint identifiers etc. Another area of 
   potential interest is to extend the outer-tunnel E-LSP signaling 
   mechanisms, e.g. those proposed by [Ganti1, Ganti2], to the VC level 
   so that one can provide multiple class-of-service within a PPVPN by 
   setting up VC-level E-LSPs.

7. QoS and Protection/Restoration in PPVPNÆs 
    
7.1.    Review of protection schemes of interest 
    
7.1.1.  MPLS protection 
    
   Path protection 
    
   It calculates (possibly in a centralized way) for each LSP a primary 
   and a protection path. As such, when a failure is detected, the 
   signaling has to go to the ingress router of the LSP which in its 
   turn re-directs traffic to the backup LSP. This signaling can take a 
   while, especially in large networks. But on the other hand, the 
   protection path is optimal. This protection mechanism offers 1:1 
   protection. 
    
   Load balancing 
    
   For each LSP, as many disjoint paths (n) as possible are determined 
   in advance and the traffic is equally split over (n-1) paths. The 
   nth path serves as a backup path in case of network failure. Again, 
   the signaling has to go all the way to the ingress router and the 
   routing of the paths is optimal. This mechanism offers 1:n 
   protection. 
    
   Fast local protection 
   - Detour: provides local protection. The way it protects LSPs is by 
   providing a detour from each node to the destination of the LSP, 
   excluding the next node. This technique offers a fast rerouting of 
   the LSPs, but it is clear that it needs a lot of LSPs to be 
   provided. As such it may be desirable to apply merging on the detour 
   LSPs. Note, however, that the alternative (sender-template specific 
   setup) is more widely applicable. 
   - Bypass: for each link-node-link set (or link) in the network a 
   bypass LSP is pre-provisioned. At the moment one of these sets 
   (links) fails, the traffic of all LSPs traversing this segment is 
   switched to the bypass tunnel. This protection mechanism offers a 
   fast rerouting of the LSPs in case of a network failure, but on the 
   other hand a lot of LSPs are needed to offer this protection. 
    
7.1.2.  Other protection mechanisms 
 
   (To be added in future versions of this document.) 
 
7.2.    Network-specific aspects 
    
7.2.1.  Topological density 
    
   Network density has an important impact on the efficiency and speed 
   with which protection techniques can be applied. With increasing 
   network density, the amount of alternative paths with (nearly) equal 
     
                Informational - Expires December 2002              35 
                         PPVPN QoS framework                June 2002 
    
   length increases. This is favorable for all protection approaches, 
   but especially for fast local protection techniques relying on the 
   availability of alternative paths close to the point of failure and 
   for low-granularity protection techniques which allows these to 
   achieve maximum load-balancing of protection capacity. 
    
7.2.2.  Traffic load 
    
   With increased load, resource sharing on backup paths becomes more 
   important. This is facilitated with a centralized approach. In case 
   of the single node/link failure model, it can also be done 
   efficiently with Bypass protection. 
    
7.3.    VPN-specific aspects 
    
7.3.1.  Efficiency and computational complexity 
    
   Protection paths can be calculated in a distributed way in the 
   network elements or in a centralized entity. Centralized computation 
   allows taking into account all traffic simultaneously as well as 
   allowing the use of sophisticated optimization algorithm for maximum 
   resource sharing. This resource efficiency comes at the price of 
   increased computational efficiency. 
    
   We can expect this trade-off to be related to the specific VPN model 
   that is chosen. If a mesh of LSPs is shared among all VPNs we can 
   expect this mesh to be fairly stable and pre-provisioned, thus 
   mandating the extra computational effort in order to get the 
   resource benefit. For VPN-specific LSPs, we might assume faster 
   response times and shorter lifetimes, hence leaning perhaps more 
   towards a distributed, less optimized approach. 
    
7.3.2.  LSP size 
    
   Large size LSPs are more difficult to protect efficiently unless 
   load balancing over several protection paths is available. This is 
   the case for end-to-end path protection and BYPASS fast local 
   protection techniques. It is less obvious for DETOUR fast local 
   protection which relies more on the per-LSP granularity to achieve 
   load-balancing. 
   If a mesh of LSPs is shared among all VPNs, these LSPs can be 
   expected to be fairly large-size, thus suggesting the use of a 
   protection method that allows efficient load balancing over multiple 
   protection paths.
