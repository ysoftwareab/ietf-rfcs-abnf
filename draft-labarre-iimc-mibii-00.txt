            Abstract

            This memo is intended to facilitate the multi-protocol
            management coexistance and interworking for networks that
            are managed using the OSI Common Management Information
            Protocol (CMIP) and networks that are managed using the
            Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  This RFC
            contains the OSI definition and registration of the OSI
            Proxy MIB-II as derived from the Internet MIB-II [RFC1213]
            according to the procedures defined in "Translation of
            Internet MIBs to OSI GDMO MIBs" [IIMCIMIBTRANS].  In
            addition, it includes the IP Forwarding Table defined in
            [RFC1354].

            Draft          Translation of Internet MIB-II      10/9/1992


            1. Introduction

            The past decade has witnessed the development of enterprise
            wide networks composed of a multi-vendor environment
            containing heterogeneous protocol and hardware suites.
            Organizations have become increasingly dependent on these
            enterprise networks for their daily operations.  This
            dependence has focussed attention on the need for operation,
            administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) of the
            multi-vendor enterprise network on an end-to-end basis.

            1.1 Background

            This memo is part of a package of ISO/CCITT and Internet
            Management Coexistence (IIMC) drafts.  Other memos included
            in this package are:

            - Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs
            (LaBarre) [IIMCIMIBTRANS]

            - Translation of ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs to Internet MIBs
            (Newnan) [IIMCOMIBTRANS]

            - Translation of Internet Party MIB (RFC1353) to ISO/CCITT
            GDMO MIB (LaBarre) [IIMCPARTY]

            - ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Proxy (Chang) [IIMCPROXY]

            These memos together comprise a package aimed at integrating
            ISO/CCITT-based and Internet-based management systems.
            These memos are offered as input to coexistence and
            interworking efforts underway throughout the
            industry,including organizations such as:

            - IETF OSI Internet Management (OIM),
            - Network Management Forum Technology Convergence Team,
            - X/Open Systems Management (SysMan),
            - OIW Network Management Special Interest Group (NMSIG), and
            - OSF Management Special Interest Group (MANSIG).

            This work was initiated, in part, by NM Forum efforts to
            translate RFC 1214 for use with OMNIPoint 1 implementations.
            Through this effort, it became obvious that end-to-end
            management requires an integrated, unified view of the
            managed network, despite differences in management protocol
            and information structure.  Integrated management can be
            facilitated by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent service, protocol,
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.  MIB
            translation procedures can be used to support proxy
            management, as well as to take advantage of existing MIB
            definition and avoid duplication of effort.  In this way,
            commercial investment in both ISO/CCITT and Internet-based
            management technologies can be preserved through deployment

            Draft          Translation of Internet MIB-II      10/9/1992


            of common methods and tools which support integration.

            This overall strategy was outlined in a joint publication
            developed by the NM Forum and X/Open entitled "ISO/CCITT and
            Internet Management: Coexistence and Interworking Strategy"
            [NMFMC92].  The memos included in the IIMC package are
            intended as detailed specifications which implement several
            of the methodologies identified in this strategy.

            1.2 Overview

            The response to the need for OAM&P of enterprise networks
            has been the development of network management standards
            within various networking communities - most notably the
            ISO/CCITT and Internet community.  However, coordination of
            standards activities between these two communities has not
            occurred.  As a result, although they share a nearly common
            management model, differences in their management protocols
            and structure of management Information (SMI) have developed
            due to differing management philosophies.

            The ISO/CCITT community has developed the Common Management
            Information Protocol (CMIP) [ISO9596], and related SMI
            documents [ISO10165-1,3,4].  The Internet community has
            developed the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
            [RFC1157], and is developing its successor, SNMP-2, based on
            [SMPPROT]. The Internet SMI is defined in [RFC1155] and
            [SMPSMI]. Although functionally similar, the Internet and
            ISO/CCITT protocols and SMIs differ in terms of their
            complexity and specific operations.

            The focus on the need for end-to-end enterprise management
            has indicated the need to integrate the management of
            components managed by ISO/CCITT management, Internet
            management and proprietary management mechanisms in a manner
            which presents a unified view of the network despite
            protocol and SMI differences.  One way to integrate
            management is by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent services, protocol
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.

            A body of telecommunications and computer vendors,
            represented by organizations such as the Network Management
            Forum (NMF), and the U.S. government, as specified in the
            Government Network Management Profile (GNMP) have based
            their integrated management model on the ISO/CCITT
            management model using CMIP and the ISO/CCITT SMI.  These
            organizations are particularly interested in the development
            of proxies for devices that use the Internet management
            protocols and SMI.  Their interest is primarily due to the
            widespread commercial implementation and use of such devices
            within their enterprises, especially devices that use the
            Internet TCP/IP protocol suite.

            The proxy architecture provides emulation of CMIS services
            by mapping to the corresponding SNMP message(s) necessary to
            carry out the service request.  The service emulation allows
            management of Internet objects by an ISO/CCITT manager.  The
            left hand side of the proxy behaves like an ISO/CCITT agent,
            communicating with the ISO/CCITT manager using CMIP
            protocols.  The right hand side  of the proxy behaves like
            an Internet manager, communicating with the Internet agent
            using SNMP protocols.

            The proxy relies on the existence of a pair of directly-
            related MIB definitions, where the Internet MIB has been
            translated into ISO/CCITT GDMO using the procedures
            specified in [IIMCMIBTRANS]. The proxy defined in
            [IIMCPROXY] uses these MIB definitions and rules to provide
            run-time translation of management information carried in
            service requests and responses.

            The proxy architecture is designed with a specified
            interface between the proxy and the underlying protocol
            stacks, and so deals primarily in terms of CMIS services and


            LaBarre                                               Page 3


            Draft          Translation of Internet MIB-II      10/9/1992


            SNMP "services".  The proxy emulates services such as CMIS
            scoping and filtering, processing of CMIS operations, and
            forwarding/logging of CMIS notifications by performing a
            mapping process which must be tailored for each protocol
            (for example, SNMP, Secure SNMP, and SNMP-2 are all variants
            of the same protocol mapping process).

            Finally, [IIMCOMIBTRANS] specifies translation procedures
            for converting ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs into Internet MIBs.  MIBs
            generated by this translation process cannot be utilized by
            the Proxy defined in [IIMCPROXY], although another kind of
            Proxy could be defined for this purpose in the future.

            1.3 Purpose and Scope

            A major reason for the rapid commercialization of devices
            manageable via the Internet management protocol is due to
            the speed with which the vendors in the Internet community
            have been able to develop MIBs based on the Internet SMI.
            To capitalize on this continuing Internet MIB development
            and their deployment in commercial devices, communities
            interested in integrated management via CMIP/SNMP proxies
            require the translation of Internet MIBs defined according
            to the Internet Structure of Management Information (SMI)
            [RFC 1155] [SMPSMI] into MIBs defined according to the ISO
            SMI [ISO 10164-1] and Guidelines for the Definition of
            Managed Objects (GDMO) [ISO 10165-4].  Procedures for such
            translations are described in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            This memo applies the procedures described in
            [IIMCIMIBTRANS] to the translation and registration of the
            Internet MIB-II as defined in [RFC1213], and to the IP
            Forwarding Table defined in [RFC1354].

            This memo assumes that the reader is familiar with the
            ISO/CCITT SMI and  terminology as well as the Internet to
            SMI translation defined in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            1.4 Terms and Conventions

                 TBD


            2. Object Class Definitions

            The Internet MIB-II objects [RFC1213] are recast into
            ISO/CCITT GDMO templates as defined in ISO10165-4], and
            registered, using the procedures defined in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            According to [IIMCIMIBTRANS], OIDs registered under the
            internet arc are of the form:

                 OID = <internet> <internetEntityId>



            LaBarre                                               Page 4


            Draft          Translation of Internet MIB-II      10/9/1992


            where <internet> is the full registration path to the
            "internet" arc; and <internetEntityId> is the portion of the
            OID that uniquely identifies entities under that arc, i.e.,
            the remainder of the OID.

            Re-registration of objects is accomplished by replacing the
            <internet>  portion of the OID with a new registration arc
            allocated for proxy registration such that the OID is of the
            form:

                 OID = <cmipsnmpProxyXX> <internetEntityId>

            Accordingly, object class OIDs assigned in this document to
            [RFC1213] groups are:

            cmipsnmpProxyIMIB
                |
                +--- mgmt (2) --- mib-2 (1) - system (1)
                                          - interfaces (2)
                                          - at (3)
                                          - ip (4)
                                          - icmp (5)
                                          - tcp (6)
                                          - udp (7)
                                          - egp (8)
                                          - transmission (10)
                                          - snmp (11)

            OIDs for additional object classes and attributes are extended
            from the above OIDs as is done in the corresponding Internet
            definitions.  The object identifier {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB} is

            5. The Containment Hierarchy

            A Naming Tree diagram for OIM MIB-II managed object classes is
            illustrated below.  Although the ISO/CCITT "system" object
            class is shown to be the root of the tree, other object
            classes may be used.

            Name Binding templates that define the containment hierarchy
            for the ISO/CCITT MIB-II managed object classes are listed
            here in alphabetical order.   The object identifier
            {cmipsnmpProxyNB} is defined in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].  Also defined
            in that document is the convention for creating OIDs for name
            bindings:

                 o  Replace the {cmipsnmpProxyIMIB} portion of the
                    ISO/CCITT defined OID for the object class, ...,
                    with {cmipsnmpProxyNB <sub-dentifier>}. The integer
                    <sub-identifier> is used to distinguish possible
                    multiple name bindings for the same object class.
                    Sub-identifier values shall be greater than or
