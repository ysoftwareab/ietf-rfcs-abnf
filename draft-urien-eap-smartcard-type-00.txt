                 EAP Smart Card Protocol (EAP-SC)        September 2004 
 
1 Abstract 
    
   Smart Cards are hardware security devices that are widely used in 
   data and voice networks to authenticate users and devices, and to 
   enforce security policies on the client platform. 
    
   The EAP Smart Card Protocol (EAP-SC) defines an EAP Method and 
   Multiplexing model for the support of Smart Card based 
   authentication methods. EAP-SC provides a uniform framework for 
   interfacing with Smart Cards within the EAP [RFC3748] context. EAP-
   SC provides for encapsulation of other EAP methods (such as [EAP-
   TLS], [EAP-SIM] and [EAP-AKA]). 
    
   EAP-SC enhances the security of authentication methods by enabling 
   the use of Smart Cards for the secure provisioning and storage of 
   keys and credentials, and the secure execution of security sensitive 
   functions. In addition, EAP-SC provides security requirements for 
   the support of Smart Card based Authentication Methods that ensure a 
   uniform level of security complementary to the underlying 
   authentication method.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
         
   EAP Smart Card 
   A Smart Card that supports an EAP authentication method on the smart 
   card, such as a smart card conforming to [SC-EAP] or [UICC-EAP]. 
    
   Smart Card EAP packet [SC EAP packet] 
   An RFC3748 compliant EAP method packet to be managed by an EAP Smart 
   Card. 
    
   EAP-SC Authentication Method 
   An Authentication Method implemented on a Smart Card within the 
   framework of EAP-SC, typically an EAP Authentication Method such as 
   EAP-TLS. 
    
3 Architecture 
    
3.1 EAP Methods and Smart Cards 
    
   According to [RFC3748], EAP methods implement the authentication 
   algorithms, handle fragmentation and receive and transmit EAP 
   messages via the EAP Peer and Authentication Server layers. 
    
   When an EAP Method uses a Smart Card, a Smart Card Handler is 
   required to manage communication between the EAP Peer Layer and the 
   Smart Card, and to handle any required user interface and card 
   management functions.

   Within the EAP multiplexing model, the overall EAP Method 
   functionality is split between the Smart Card Handler and the Smart 
   Card functions or applications.

3.2 The EAP-SC Multiplexing Model 
    
   The EAP-SC Multiplexing model addresses the fact that Smart Cards 
   can be removed and multiple Smart Cards can be used with a peer. In 
   addition, many types of Smart Card types may be supported, and each 
   Smart Card type may support one or multiple authentication methods 
   and credentials. For this reason, EAP-SC must query the Smart Card 
   and determine the type of card and application before initiating the 
   EAP transaction.

   The EAP-SC handling layer receives and sends EAP packets, selects a 
   Smart Card handler, and passes packets to the Smart Card handler.  
    
   The EAP Smart Card Handler layer handles the interface to the smart 
   card, as well as any EAP Method specific functions that are not 
   handled in the smart card.  
    
   The Smart Card executes security sensitive Authentication Method 
   functions in conjunction with the EAP Smart Card Handler. 
    
3.3 Smart Card Support 
    
   The EAP-SC method MUST be compatible with [SC-EAP] and [UICC-EAP] 
   type Smart Cards that implement [EAP-TLS]. The EAP-SC method MAY 
   support smart cards supporting [EAP-SIM], [WLAN-SIM], [EAP-AKA], 
   [EAP-PEAP], [EAP-TTLS]. 
   EAP-SC MUST NOT support any Smart Card based EAP Method that does 
   not meet the security requirements in section 6.

   A packet is sent to the EAP-SC Handler when its Type [RFC3748] is 
   equal to the EAP-SC value. 
    
   The EAP-SC payload is the same format as the Expanded Type described 
   in section 5.7 of [RFC 3748].

   - Vendor-Id, three bytes set to zero, Reserved for Future Use 
    
   - Vendor-Type, four bytes. The first three significant bytes are 
   null, the least significant byte (Vendor-Type[7,0]) represents the 
   EAP-Type to be processed by the Smart Card. 
    
   - Vendor-Data, represents the EAP method packet (without the Code, 
   Identifier and Length fields) to be processed by the EAP Smart Card 
   [SC-EAP] or [UICC-EAP]. 
    
   The complete EAP-SC packet structure with its transported EAP method 
   packet or Smart Card EAP packet is as follow.

   - The Identifier MUST be identical to the transported Smart Card EAP 
   packed Identifier. 
    
   - The Length field MUST be equal to the transported Smart Card EAP 
   packet Length plus 8. 
    
   - The Type field MUST be set to EAP-SC Type. 
    
   - The Vendor-Id field MUST be set to zero. 
    
   - The Vendor-Type field MUST be set to zero for the 3 most 
   significant bytes and set to the transported Smart Card EAP packet 
   Type for the last significant byte. 
    
   - The Vendor-Data field MUST contains the transported Smart Card EAP 
   packed Type and Payload. 
    
4.2 EAP Packet Handling at the Peer Side 
    
4.2.1   Incoming EAP Packet Handling at the Peer Side 
    
   The EAP-SC layer rebuilds the transported EAP method packets to be 
   processed by the Smart Card. 
    
   The EAP-SC layer modifies the incoming EAP-SC packets by removing 
   the EAP-SC Type, the Vendor-Id and the Vendor-Type fields and by 
   subtracting the Length field by 8. Then the EAP message is forwarded 
   to the appropriate Smart Card Handler, such as [WLAN-SC]. 
    
4.2.2   Outgoing EAP Packet Handling at the Peer Side 
    
   The EAP-SC layer builds the EAP-SC EAP packet from the Smart Card 
   EAP packet to transport. 
    
   The EAP-SC layer modifies the Smart Card EAP packets by inserting 
   the EAP-SC Type, the Vendor-Id, the Vendor-Type fields and by 
   setting Vendor-Type field with the transported Smart Card EAP Type 
   and adding the Length value with 8. Then, packets are sent to the 
   Authentication Server. 
    
4.3 EAP Packet Handling at the Authentication Server Side 
    
4.3.1   Incoming EAP Packet Handling at the Authentication Server Side 
    
   The EAP-SC layer modifies the Incoming EAP-SC packets by removing 
   the EAP-SC Type, the Vendor-Id and the Vendor-Type fields and by 
   subtracting the Length field by 8. Then, the EAP packets MUST be 
   processed by the Authentication Server. 
    
4.3.2   Outgoing EAP Packet Handling at the Authentication Server Side

   The EAP-SC layer modifies the Outgoing EAP-SC packets by inserting 
   the EAP-SC Type, the Vendor-Id, the Vendor-Type fields and by 
   setting Vendor-Type field with the transported EAP Type and adding 
   the Length value with 8. Then the authentication server MUST send 
   the packets to the Peer. 
    
5 IANA considerations 
    
   EAP-SC type is set to xx 
    
6 Security Considerations 
    
6.1 Threat Model 
    
   An attacker may attack a typical EAP transaction by compromising the 
   peer. For example, an attacker may gain access to genuine keys and 
   credentials and share these with an unauthorized user. Or an 
   attacker may gain access and modify cryptographic processes as they 
   are executed on the peer platform. 
 
   Security policies must be established to secure against such peer 
   attacks. The EAP-SC type makes it possible to enforce security 
   policies by using smartcards. 
    
   This includes scenarios which require strong authentication of the 
   end user, where the end user platform is vulnerable to direct 
   attack, where the end user may be considered an enabling agent in 
   the attack, or where the enforcement of end user policies is subject 
   to legal requirements. Examples of such scenarios are: 
   - A service provider wanting to grant subscribers access to network 
   based value added services  
   - A hospital subject to medical privacy regulations that needs to 
   assure that only authorized personnel can access patient 
   information. 
   - A government organization which needs to secure classified 
   information 
    
6.2 Smart Card Security Capabilities and Requirements 
    
   Smart cards are a highly effective means of enforcing security 
   policies. Smart cards are typically carried by one party (the end 
   user, such as an employee or customer) but are controlled by another 
   party (the issuer, such as an enterprise or service provider). 
   Applications running on the Smart Card are controlled by the issuer, 
   and serve to protect the interests of the issuer.  
    
   The following sub sections describe Smart Card security capabilities 
   and requirements for EAP-SC Authentication Methods relating to those 
   capabilities:

6.2.1   Smart Card Technology 
   The Smart Card consists of a microprocessor and non-volatile memory 
   chipset enclosed in a physically tamper resistant module. This 
   module is then embedded in a plastic card, or the module may be 
   integrated into an alternative form factor, such as a USB device. 
    
6.2.2   Tamper Resistant Storage and Execution 
   Smart cards provide protective measures against physical and logical 
   attacks against the processor and non-volatile memory. This enables 
   the secure storage of end user cryptographic keys and user 
   credentials, and secures execution of security sensitive operations 
   such as encryption and digital signatures. 
    
   The EAP-SC Authentication Method MUST store all secret cryptographic 
   keys on the smart card in non-volatile memory. The EAP-SC 
   Authentication Method MUST execute in the smart card all 
   cryptographic functions that use stored secret cryptographic keys. 
   The EAP-SC Authentication Method MUST NOT export any secret 
   cryptographic keys from the smart card. 
    
6.2.3   Multi Factor Authentication 
   Smart cards generally require a Smart Card handler to authenticate 
   to the Smart Card in order to access data or application 
   functionality. This makes it possible to enforce multi factor user 
   authentication by combining something the user has (the smart card) 
   with something the user knows (such as PIN) or is (Biometric 
   authentication). 
    
   The EAP Authentication Method MUST enforce the use of the user PIN 
   or Biometric before user credentials may be accessed or used.  
    
6.2.4   Random Number Generation 
   Smart Cards generally contain a hardware based true random number 
   generator independent of external or internal clocks and immune to 
   outside interferences. The quality of the hardware generator is 
   further enhanced by logical processing to ensure excellent 
   statistical properties; and these properties are checked regularly 
   on-board. 
    
   The EAP Authentication Method MUST use the Smart Card Random Number 
   Generator anywhere Random Numbers are required. 
    
6.2.5   Cryptographic Capabilities 
   Smart cards provide certified, built-in implementation and optimised 
   execution of common cryptographic algorithms such as AES, DES, RSA, 
   and ECC... 
    
   The EAP Authentication Method MUST use the built-in Smart Card 
   cryptographic capabilities for the execution of any cryptographic 
   functionality.

6.2.6   Secure Provisioning 
   Smart cards provide a secure method of provisioning credentials, 
   applications and trusted network information from the issuer or 
   service provider to the end user, and managing this information 
   after the card has been issued. Smart cards support automated 
   personalization (including card initialization, loading of card data 
   and printing) enabling issuance in very large numbers. 
    
   The EAP-SC Authentication method MUST implement support for pre-
   issuance personalization, as for example by supporting [GLOBAL 
   PLATFORM] or similar functionality. The EAP-SC Authentication method 
   SHOULD implement support for post-issuance card and application 
   management. 
    
6.2.7   Certification 
   The processes for designing and manufacturing smart cards are 
   subject to rigorous security controls. This makes possible the 
   certification of Smart Card functionality and applications by 
   standardization organizations. 
    
   The EAP-SC Authentication method MUST be implemented on a Smart Card 
   platform that has been evaluated for security by a standards 
   organization program such as [FIPS] or [COMMON CRITERIA]. 
    
6.3 Smart Cards and EAP Security Claims 
    
   EAP-SC enhances the security of Authentication Methods by enabling 
   the enforcement of security policies on the End User platform. The 
   overall security of EAP-SC is dependent on the security of the 
   Authentication Method implemented on the Smart Card.  
    
   The following section discusses certain EAP Security Claims and how 
   they are enhanced by Smart Card security features.  
    
6.3.1   Mutual Authentication 
    
   Mutual authentication processes are generally based upon the use of 
   random numbers. Smart Cards enhance the security of these processes 
   by providing true random number generation. 
    
6.3.2   Confidentiality 
    
   Smart Cards improve the robustness of EAP messages encryption, by 
   providing tamper resistant storage for the encryption keys and 
   secure execution of the encryption algorithms.

6.3.3   Key Derivation 
    
   Smart Cards improve the confidentiality of the key derivation 
   process by providing tamper resistant storage for the master keys 
   and secure execution of the key derivation algorithms. 
    
6.3.4   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks 
    
   Smart Cards improve security against Trojan Horse attacks by 
   providing a logically tamper resistant environment for the full 
   implementation of EAP methods and secure execution of the encryption 
   algorithms. 
    
6.3.5   Dictionary Attacks 
    
   Smart Cards access is commonly protected via pin codes with a 
   limited number of retries; permanent blocking of the device is 
   enforced when the number of retries is exceeded. This mechanism 
   provides enhanced protection against dictionary attacks aiming at 
   discovering passwords. 
    
6.3.6   Cryptographic Binding 
    
   Smart Cards provides tamper resistant storage for cryptographic keys 
   and secure execution of the tunnel creation algorithms thus 
   enhancing the cryptographic binding process. 
    
6.3.7   Channel Binding 
    
   Smart Cards can be used as a secure out of band distribution method 
   for channel parameters and therefore enhance the channel binding 
   process. 
    
6.3.8   Protection Against Rogue Networks 
    
   Smart Cards facilitate the provisioning and secure storage of 
   information about trusted parties, such as the root certificates of 
   trusted networks. This protects the end user against rogue networks 
   and enables the enforcement of network roaming policies. 
    
6.3.9   Authentication Method Security  
    
   The overall security of EAP-SC is dependent on the encapsulated EAP-
   SC Authentication Method. Weaknesses in the underlying method, such 
   as weaknesses in integrity protection, replay protection or key 
   strength, are detrimental to the overall security.
