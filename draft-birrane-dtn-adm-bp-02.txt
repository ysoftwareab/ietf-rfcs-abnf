1.  Introduction

   An Application Data Model (ADM) provides a guaranteed interface for
   the management of an application or protocol in accordance with the
   Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA) defined in
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-ama].  The ADM described in this document complies
   with the ADM Template provided in [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm] as encoded
   using the JSON syntax.

   Bundle Protocol Agents (BPAs) are software instances that implement
   functionality required by the Bundle Protocol ([I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis]).
   The BPA ADM provides the set of information necessary to remotely
   manage such agents.

1.1.  Technical Notes

   o  This document describes Version 0.1 of the BP ADM.

   o  The AMM Resource Identifier (ARI) for this ADM is NOT correctly
      set.  A sample ARI is used in this version of the specification
      and MAY change in future versions of this ADM until an ARI
      registry is established.  This notice will be removed at that
      time.

   o  Agent applications MAY choose to ignore the name, description, or
      other annotative information associated with the component
      definitions within this ADM where such items are only used to
      provide human-readable information or are otherwise not necessary
      to manage a device.

1.2.  Scope

   This ADM specifies those components of the Asynchronous Management
   Model (AMM) common to the management of any instance of a BPA.

   Any Manager software implementing this ADM MUST perform the
   responsibilities of an AMA Manager as outlined in
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm] as they relate to the objects included in this
   document.

   Any Agent software implementing this ADM MUST perform the
   responsibilities of an AMA Agent as outlined in [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm]
   as they relate to the objects included in this document.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Structure and Design of this ADM

   The BP Agent ADM's structure is in accordance to
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm].  This ADM contains metadata, edd, report
   templates, and controls.  Externally Defined Data (EDD) are values
   that are calculated external to the ADM system.  Report Templates are
   ordered sets of data descriptions that show how values will be
   represented in a corresponding report.  Controls are predefined and
   sometimes parameterized opcodes that can be run on an Agent.
   Controls are preconfigured in Agents and Managers as part of ADM
   support.  There are no variables, table templates, macros, constants,
   or operators in this ADM at this time.  The contents of this ADM are
   derived from the main functions and data that are needed to configure
   and manage bundle protocol operations on an ION node.

   All ADMs have metadata that includes the name, namespace, and version
   of the ADM as well as the name of the organization that is issuing
   that particular ADM.  This is important for identification purposes
   of the ADMs and to ensure version control.  The main elements of BP
   that are discussed in this ADM are endpoints, the priority of
   bundles/bytes, and whether or not the bundles/bytes were transferred
   successfully.

3.  Naming and Identification

   This section outlines the namespaces used to uniquely identify ADM
   objects in this specification.

3.1.  Namespace and Nicknames

   In accordance with [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm], every ADM is assigned a
   moderated Namespace.  In accordance with [I-D.birrane-dtn-amp], these
   namespaces may be enumerated for compactness.  The namespace and ADM
   identification for these objects is defined as follows.

                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    |    Identifier   |    Value     |
                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    |    Namespace    | DTN/bp_agent |
                    |                 |              |
                    | ADM Enumeration |      2       |
                    +-----------------+--------------+

                      Table 1: Namespace Information

   Given the above ADM enumeration, in accordance with
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-amp], the following AMP nicknames are defined.

                +----------+------------------------------+
                | Nickname |          Collection          |
