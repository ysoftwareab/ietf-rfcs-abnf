                    OSPF Flooding Reduction in MSDC
              draft-xu-ospf-flooding-reduction-in-msdc-02

Abstract

   OSPF is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for MSDC
   (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  For a given OSPF router
   within the CLOS topology, it would receive multiple copies of exactly
   the same LSA from multiple OSPF neighbors.  In addition, two OSPF
   neighbors may send each other the same LSA simultaneously.  The
   unneccessary link-state information flooding wastes the precious
   process resource of OSPF routers greatly due to the fact that there
   are too many OSPF neighbors for each OSPF router within the CLOS
   topology.  This document proposes some extensions to OSPF so as to
   reduce the OSPF flooding within MSDC networks greatly.  The reduction
   of the OSPF flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of
   MSDC networks.  These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3.

1.  Introduction

   OSPF is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for Massively
   Scalable Data Center (MSDC) networks where CLOS is the most popular
   toplogy.  For a given OSPF router within the CLOS topology, it would
   receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSA from multiple OSPF
   neighbors.  In addition, two OSPF neighbors may send each other the
   same LSA simultaneously.  The unnecessary link-state information
   flooding wastes the precious process resource of OSPF routers greatly
   and therefore OSPF could not scale very well in MSDC networks.

   To simplify the network management task, centralized controllers are
   becoming fundamental network elements in most MSDCs.  One or more
   controllers are usually connected to all routers within the MSDC
   network via a Local Area Network (LAN) which is dedicated for network
   management purpose (called management LAN), as shown in Figure 1.

   With the assistance of controllers acting as OSPF Designated Router
   (DR)/Backup Designated Router (BDR) for the management LAN, OSPF
   routers within the MSDC network don't need to exchange any other
   types of OSPF packet than the OSPF Hello packet among them.  As
   specified in [RFC2328], these Hello packets are used for the purpose
   of establishing and maintaining neighbor relationships and ensuring
   bidirectional communication between OSPF neighbors, and even the DR/
   BDR election purpose in the case where those OSPF routers are
   connected to a broadcast network.  In order to obtain the full
   topology information (i.e., the fully synchronized link-state
   database) of the MSDC's network, these OSPF routers just need to
   exchange the link-state information with the controllers being
   elected as OSPF DR/BDR for the management LAN instead.

   To further suppress the flooding of multicast OSPF packets originated
   from OSPF routers over the management LAN, OSPF routers would not

   send multicast OSPF Hello packets over the management LAN.  Insteads,
   they just wait for OSPF Hello packets originated from the controllers
   being elected as OSPF DR/BDR initially.  Once OSPF DR/BDR for the
   management LAN have been discovered, they start to send OSPF Hello
   packets directly (as unicasts) to OSPF DR/BDR periodically.  In
   addition, OSPF routers would send other types of OSPF packets (e.g.,
   Database Descriptor packet, Link State Request packet, Link State
   Update packet, Link State Acknowledgment packet) to OSPF DR/BDR for
   the management LAN as unicasts as well.  In contrast, the controllers
   being elected as OSPF DR/BDR would send OSPF packets as specified in
   [RFC2328].  As a result, OSPF routers would not receive OSPF packets
   from one another unless these OSPF packets are forwarded as unknown
   unicasts over the management LAN.  Through the above modifications to
   the current OSPF router behaviors, the OSPF flooding is greatly
   reduced, which is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC
   networks.  These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2
   [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340].

   Furthermore, the mechanism for OSPF refresh and flooding reduction in
   stable topologies as described in [RFC4136] could be considered as
   well.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC2328].

3.  Modifications to Current OSPF Behaviors

3.1.  OSPF Routers as Non-DRs

   After the exchange of OSPF Hello packets among OSPF routers, the OSPF
   neighbor relationship among them would transition to and remain in
   the TWO-WAY state.  OSPF routers would originate Router-LSAs and/or
   Network-LSAs accordingly depending upon the link-types.  Note that
   the neighbors in the TWO-WAY state would be advertised in the Router-
   LSAs and/or Network-LSA.  This is a little bit different from the
   OSPF router behavior as specified in [RFC2328] where the neighbors in
   the TWO-WAY state would not be advertised.  However, these self-
   originated LSAs need not to be exchanged directly among them anymore.
   Instead, these LSAs just need to be sent solely to the controllers
   being elected as OSPF DR/BDR for the management LAN.

   To further reduce the flood of multicast OSPF packets over the
   management LAN, OSPF routers SHOULD send OSPF packets as unicasts.
   More specifically, OSPF routers SHOULD send unicast OSPF Hello
   packets periodically to the controllers being elected as OSPF DR/BDR.
   In other words, OSPF routers would not send any OSPF Hello packet
   over the management LAN until they have found OSPF DR/BDR for the
   management LAN.  Note that OSPF routers SHOULD NOT be elected as OSPF
   DR/BDR for the management LAN (This is done by setting the Router
   Priority of those OSPF routers to zero).  As a result, OSPF routers
   would not see each other over the management LAN.  Furthermore, OSPF
   routers SHOULD send all other types of OSPF packets than OSPF Hello
   packets (i.e., Database Descriptor packet, Link State Request packet,
   Link State Update packet, Link State Acknowledgment packet) to the
   controllers being elected as OSPF DR/BDR as unicasts as well.

   To avoid the data traffic from being forwarded across the management
   LAN, the cost of all OSPF routers' interfaces to the management LAN
   SHOULD be set to the maximum value.

   When a given OSPF router lost its connection to the management LAN,
   it SHOULD actively establish FULL adjacency with all of its OSPF
   neighbors within the CLOS network.  As such, it could obtain the full
   LSDB of the CLOS network while flooding its self-originated LSAs to
   the remaining part of the whole network.  That's to say, for a given
   OSPF router within the CLOS network, it would not actively establish
   FULL adjacency with its OSPF neighbor in the TWO-WAY state by
   default.  However, it SHOULD NOT refuse to establish FULL adjacency
   with a given OSPF neighbors when receiving Database Description
   Packets from that OSPF neighbor.

3.2.  Controllers as DR/BDR

   The controllers being elected as OSPF DR/BDR would send OSPF packets
   as multicasts or unicasts as per [RFC2328].  In addition, Link State
   Acknowledgment packets are RECOMMENDED to be sent as unicasts rather
   than multicasts if possible.
