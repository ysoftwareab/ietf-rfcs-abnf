1. Abstract

   This document specifies a packetization scheme for encapsulating
   12-bit nonlinear, 20-bit linear and 24-bit linear audio data streams
   using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  This draft also
   specifies the format of the SDP announcement when audio data is
   preemphasized before sampling.  The treatment of preemphasized audio
   data specified in this document could be used with other audio
   formats such as L16.

2. Introduction

   This document describes the sampling of audio data in 12-bit
   nonlinear, 20-bit linear and 24-bit linear encodings, and specifies
   the encapsulation of the audio data into the Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP), version 2 [1,2].  DAT audio and DV video devices
   [3,4] use these audio encodings in addition to 16-bit linear
   encoding.  The packetization scheme for 16-bit linear audio (L16) is
   already specified [2,5,6].  This document specifies the packetization
   scheme for the other encodings following that for L16; in particular,
   when used with the RTP profile [2], these payload formats follow the
   encoding-independent rules for sample ordering and channel
   interleaving specified in [2] plus extensions specified here.  This
   document also specifies out-of-band negotiation methods for the
   extended channel interleaving rules and for use when an analog
   preemphasis technique is applied to the audio data.


2.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [7]


3. The need for RTP encapsulation of 12-, 20- and 24-bit audio

   Many high-quality digital audio and visual systems, such as DAT and
   DV, adopt sample-based audio encodings.  Different audio formats are
   used in various situations.  To transport the audio data using RTP,
   an encapsulation needs to be defined for each specific format.  Only
   16-bit linear audio encapsulation (L16) has thus far been defined.
   Other encoding formats have already appeared, such as the 12-bit
   nonlinear, 20-bit linear and 24-bit linear encodings used in the DAT
   and DV video world.  This specification defines the RTP payload
   encapsulation format in order to use the new encodings in the RTP
   environment.


4. 12-bit nonlinear audio encapsulation

   IEC 61119 [3] specifies the 12-bit nonlinear audio format in DAT and
   DV, called LP (Long Play) audio.  It would be easy to convert 12-bit
   nonlinear audio into 16-bit linear form at the RTP sender and
   transmit it using the L16 audio format already defined.  However,
   this would consume 33% more network bandwidth than necessary.  This
   payload format is specified as a more efficient alternative.

    Table 1. Conversion from 16-bit linear values (X) to 12-bit
             nonlinear values (Y) [3]

Internet Draft       draft-ietf-avt-dv-audio-03.txt        March 2, 2001


   The 12-bit nonlinear encoding is the same as for 16-bit linear audio
   except for the packing of each sampled data element.  Each sample of
   12-bit nonlinear audio is derived from a single sample of 16-bit
   linear audio by a nonlinear compression.  Table 1 shows the details
   of the conversion from 16 to 12 bits.  The result is a 12-bit signed
   value ranging from -2048 to 2047 and represented in two's complement
   notation.  The 12-bit samples are packed contiguously into payload
   octets starting with the most significant bit.  When the payload
   contains an odd number of samples, the four LSBs of the last octet
   are unused.  Parameters other than quantization, e.g., sampling
   frequency and audio channel assignment, are the same as in the L16
   payload format.  In particular, samples are packed into the packet in
   time sequence beginning with the oldest sample.

   When conveying encoding information in an SDP [8] session
   description, the 12-bit nonlinear audio payload format specified here
   is given the encoding name "DAT12".  Thus, the media format
   representation might be:

      m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 97 98
      a=rtpmap:97 DAT12/32000/2
      a=rtpmap:98 L16/48000/2


5. 20- and 24-bit linear audio encapsulation

   The 20- and 24-bit linear audio encodings are simply an extension of
   the L16 linear audio encoding [2].  The 20- or 24-bit uncompressed
   audio data samples are represented as signed values in two's
   complement notation.  The samples are packed contiguously into
   payload octets starting with the most significant bit.  For the
   20-bit encoding, when the payload contains an odd number of samples,
   the four LSBs of the last octet are unused.  Samples are packed into
   the packet in time sequence beginning with the oldest sample.

   When conveying encoding information in an SDP session description,
   the 20- and 24-bit linear audio payload formats specified here are
   given the encoding names "L20" and "L24", respectively.  An example
   SDP audio media description would be:

      m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 99 100
      a=rtpmap:99 L20/48000/2
      a=rtpmap:100 L24/48000


6. Preemphasized audio data

   In order to improve the higher frequency characteristics of audio

Internet Draft       draft-ietf-avt-dv-audio-03.txt        March 2, 2001


   signals, analog preemphasis is often applied to the signal before
   quantization.  If analog preemphasis was applied before the payload
   data was sampled, the type of the preemphasis SHOULD be conveyed with
   out-of-band signaling.  An "emphasis" parameter is defined for this
   purpose and may be conveyed either as a MIME optional parameter or
   using the SDP format-specific attribute (a=fmtp line) as below:

      a=fmtp:<payload type> emphasis=<emphasis type>

   Only one <emphasis type> value is defined for the parameter at this
   point:

      50/15           <50/15 microsecond CD-type emphasis>

   This preemphasis attribute can also be used in other audio formats
   such as L16 [6].  For backward compatibility with these payload
   formats that were defined without consideration of a preemphasis
   attribute, if preemphasis is not applied the emphasis attribute MUST
   NOT be included in the SDP record.

   A sample SDP record showing preemphasis applied only to payload type
   99 might be as follows:

      m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 99 100
      a=rtpmap:99 L20/48000/2
      a=fmtp:99 emphasis=50/15
      a=rtpmap:100 L24/48000


7. Channel interleaving and non-AIFF-C audio channel convention

   When multiple channels of audio, such as in a stereo program, are
   multiplexed into a single RTP stream, the audio samples from each
   channel are interleaved according to the rules specified in [2] to be
   consistent with the L16 payload format.  That is, samples from
   different channels taken at the same sampling instant are packed into
   consecutive octets.  For example, for a two-channel encoding, the
   sample sequence is (left channel, first sample), (right channel,
   first sample), (left channel, second sample), (right channel, second
   sample).  Samples for all channels belonging to a single sampling
   instant MUST be contained in the same packet.

   This sample order differs from the packing of samples into blocks in
   a native DV audio stream.  Therefore, applications transmitting DV
   audio using the payload formats defined in this document MUST
   reshuffle the samples into the order specified here.  This
   requirement is intended to enable interworking between DV systems and
   other digital audio systems.  Applications choosing to send bundled

Internet Draft       draft-ietf-avt-dv-audio-03.txt        March 2, 2001


   DV audio/video streams using the native DV block structure may use
   the payload format defined in [9] instead.

   Most of the existing RTP audio payload formats follow the AIFF-C
   convention for channel ordering as specified in [2] when sending more
   than two audio channels within a single RTP stream.  However, this
   convention does not cover some applications.  For example, some DV
   audio formats define a "woofer" channel, but AIFF-C does not include
   this frequency-dependent channel.  Thus, it is necessary to specify
   the audio channel allocation information explicitly when the contents
   of the audio stream are beyond the scope of AIFF-C.

   For DV audio streams of 4 or more channels, the channel order MUST be
   specified out-of-band.  This applies both to the payload formats
   defined in this document and to the L16 payload format.  A "channel-
   order" parameter is defined for this purpose and may be conveyed
   either as a MIME optional parameter or with the SDP a=fmtp attribute
   using the following syntax:

      a=fmtp:<payload type> channel-order=<convention>:<order>

   The first component of the value, <convention>, specifies the type of
   channel assignment convention used.  This allows for conventions
   other than AIFF-C and DV to be defined in the future.  This document
   defines only one convention for use in the channel-order parameter:

      DV

   The second component of the value, <order>, indicates the arrangement
   of channels within the stream.  The DV video specification IEC61834-4
   [4] defines the types of audio channels that may be present and in
   what order.  The symbols used to denote the channel types are
   reproduced in the Appendix at the end of this document.  For the DV
   convention, the following values, which were formed from the
   concatenation of the individual channel symbols in the allowed
   channel orders, are defined for the <order> component:

      4 channels: LRLsRs, LRCS, LRCWo
      5 channels: LRLsRsC
      6 channels: LRLsRsCS, LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2
      8 channels: LRCWoLsRsLmixRmix, LRCWoLs1Rs1Ls2Rs2, LRCWoLsRsLcRc

   The <convention> and <order> symbols are case-insensitive, but are
   shown here in mixed case to make the individual channel symbols
   unambiguous. These concatenated symbols were deliberately constructed
   without separators to make clear the fact that the channels MUST NOT
   be assembled in other, arbitrary orders.

Internet Draft       draft-ietf-avt-dv-audio-03.txt        March 2, 2001


   The channel-order parameter MUST be consistent with the number of
   channels specified in the MIME optional parameter "channels" or in
   the a=rtpmap attribute of SDP.  For RTP audio streams of 1, 2 or 3
   channels, the AIFF-C channel order is used and is implicit in the
   number of audio channels specified.  To allow backward compatibility,
   the channel-order parameter MUST NOT be included in this case.

   Note that for the DV convention with 5 channels only one channel
   order is allowed, but for consistency the channel-order parameter
   MUST be included nonetheless.

   An example of an SDP session description using the channel-order
   parameter is:

      v=0
      o=ikob 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 126.16.64.4
      s=POI (Audio only)
      i=A Seminar on making Presentations on the Internet
      u=http://www.koganei.wide.ad.jp/~ikob/POI/index.html
      e=ikob@koganei.wide.ad.jp (Katsushi Kobayashi)
      c=IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
      t=2873397496 2873404696
      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 112 113
      a=rtpmap:112 L16/48000/2
      a=rtpmap:113 DAT12/32000/4
      a=fmtp:113 emphasis=50/15; channel-order=DV:LRCWO

   This session description shows the audio medium being transmitted in
   two formats, L16 and DAT12, using payload type numbers 112 and 113,
   respectively.  For the L16 format, the audio data contains 2-channel
   stereo following the implicit, default AIFF-C convention for left
   channel first and right channel second.  For the DAT12 format, the
   audio data contains 4 channels following the DV audio convention for
   the channels left, right, center, and woofer.

   This example also shows how multiple MIME optional parameters
   ("emphasis" and "channel-order") are mapped to a single a=fmtp
   attribute as specified in [6].

   The channel-order parameter described here provides a generic out-of-
   band mechanism to define alternatives to the AIFF-C channel order.
   However, if multi-channel audio data could be sent following the
   AIFF-C channel convention after simple processing such as a data
   shuffling on the sender side, the alternative channel order SHOULD
   NOT be defined and instead the AIFF-C order SHOULD be employed to
   maximize interoperability.

   Moreover, multiple channels of audio data should only be multiplexed



Kobayashi, et al.          Expires August 2001                [Page 7]

Internet Draft       draft-ietf-avt-dv-audio-03.txt        March 2, 2001


   within a single RTP stream when all of the audio channels are
   intended to be reproduced together, such as the left and right
   channels in a stereo program.  Independent audio channels, such as
   multiple language translations, SHOULD be sent in separate RTP
   sessions.  This reduces bandwidth requirements by allowing receivers
   to tune in to only those channels which are desired.


8. MIME registration

   This document defines some new RTP payload format names which are
   also registered as MIME subtypes: DAT12, L20 and L24.  The
   registration forms for these MIME subtypes are provided in the next
   sections.

8.1 MIME registration form for audio/DAT12

     MIME media type name: audio

     MIME subtype name: DAT12

     Required parameters:
        rate: number of samples per second -- RECOMMENDED values for
          rate are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100 and
          48000 samples per second.  Other values are permissible.

     Optional parameters:
        channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults
          to 1; stereo would be 2, etc.  Interleaving takes place
          between individual 12-bit samples.

        emphasis: analog preemphasis applied to the data before
          quantization.  The only emphasis value defined here is
          emphasis=50/15 to indicate 50/15 microsecond preemphasis.
          This parameter MUST be omitted if no analog preemphasis was
          applied.

        channel-order: specifies the sample interleaving order for
          multiple-channel audio streams (see Section 7).  Permissible
          values are DV:LRLsRs, DV:LRCS, DV:LRCWo, DV:LRLsRsC,
          DV:LRLsRsCS, DV:LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2, DV:LRCWoLsRsLmixRmix,
          DV:LRCWoLs1Rs1Ls2Rs2, DV:LRCWoLsRsLcRc.  This parameter MUST
          be omitted when the AIFF-C channel order convention is in use.

     Encoding considerations:
       DAT12 audio can be transmitted with RTP as specified in this
       document.

9. Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [1], and any appropriate RTP profile [2].  This implies
   that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.
   Because the data compression used along with this payload format is
   applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed after compression so
   there is no conflict between the two operations.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
   be overloaded.  However, this encoding does not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity.

   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may
   be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either
   desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to
   discard packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of
   the authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast
   environment, pruning of specific sources may be implemented in future
   versions of IGMP [10] and in multicast routing protocols to allow a
   receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach it.


10. IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new MIME subtype-specific optional
   parameters and the sets of permissible values for those parameters.
   It is expected that the number of additional values that will need to
   be defined for those parameters is small.  Therefore, anyone wishing
   to define new values is required to produce a revision of this
   document to be vetted through the normal Internet Standards process.
