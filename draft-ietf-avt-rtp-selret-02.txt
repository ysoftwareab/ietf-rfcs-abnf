2  Abstract 
    
   This document describes new RTP payload formats to enable multiple 
   and optional selective retransmissions in RTP. They are especially 
   applicable to environments where low delay RTCP feedback is 
   available, such as described in [4]. These payload formats can be 
   used to separate the media stream according to prioritization of 
   packets or according to the status of the transmission (i.e. 
   transmission or retransmission). This serves as a retransmission 
   framework, where we give examples how this can be used for different 
   retransmission schemes.

4  Introduction to the problem 
    
   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)[3] was designed as an 
   Internet protocol to transmit real-time (or near real-time) data 
   over multicast or unicast. Even though the multicast capability is a 
   strong feature of RTP, a common use of it is non-interactive unicast 
   transmission of media streams. This application, further referred to  
   as media streaming, has lower delay requirements. A constant offset 
   delay, in which already received packets are stored at the client, 
   is tolerable.   
    
   Typically RTP is run over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). While 
   the unreliable UDP performs good for reliable channels, the quality 
   of the received media stream is bad, when transmitted over error-
   prone links. Especially compressed streams, such as MPEG video-data, 
   are highly susceptible to packet loss, which will lead to a bad 
   video quality at the client. E.g. in a wireless environment with a 
   unstable transmission quality (bit error rate (BER) about 10E-3 .. 
   10E-6) a sufficient quality of video and voice transmitted by RTP 
   cannot be achieved.  
    
   The scenario for such a media streaming over an error-prone link 
   might be the one in Figure 1.  Media files are stored on a media 
   server which is connected via an internet link to a mobile network. 
    
    
     RTP Retransmission Payload Format                         July 2001     
    
    
   The wireless link between the mobile network and the mobile 
   terminal, which works as the client in this scenario, is generally 
   unreliable and subject to bit errors.

              Figure 1 : Scenario for media streaming 
    
    
   To achieve a better quality of the received media stream, especially 
   when transmitted over error-prone links, retransmissions of lost 
   packets of the stream seems to be a possible solution. However the 
   quite low delay requirements of media streaming applications and the 
   bandwidth limitations of the wireless link have to be considered. In 
   wireless systems bandwidth is a scarce resource and efficient use of 
   this resource is of vital importance. Hence reliability for the 
   complete media stream might not be achievable. 
     
   Furthermore in compressed media streams, e.g. MPEG video stream, not 
   every frame is equally important. In this example some frames 
   contain data that other data depends upon, which makes these frames 
   more important. Current protocols applying retransmission for 
   reliable transmission (e.g. TCP)  make no use of this characteristic 
   of compressed media streams. 
    
   Therefore a retransmission scheme that retransmits selected packets, 
   but if necessary these packets several times seems to be the best 
   solution and can substantially enhance the quality of the received 
   media stream. 
    
   In the next section a framework is outlined which is based on the 
   payload formats defined in sections 6 and 7. This framework enables 
   us to do multiple selective retransmissions as we describe in 
   sections 10 and 11.

5  Outline of the solution 
    
   Much work has been done recently to make RTP more reliable. As one 
   result a new feedback timing behavior for unicast sessions or small 
   multicast groups is proposed [4], which includes a framework of how 
   to use this feedback. This document include the ability to indicate 
   the detection of packet loss from the receiver to the sender. With 
   this functionality it is possible for the server to do 
   retransmissions for lost packets. However this scheme would be very 
   general and simple and lacks the possibility to do selective or 
   multiple retransmissions effectively.  
    
   The payload formats presented in this document are meant as a 
   general solution to enable retransmissions in RTP. Based on this 
   scheme we present two examples how the payload formats could be used 
   to realize first a retransmissions scheme which concentrates on 
   bandwidth efficiency within the media stream and second a somehow 
   more complex retransmission scheme for special applications that 
   indicates the priority of the transmitted media in-band. It is 
   described in detail in section 11. 
    
   The payload formats are not meant to replace a media RTP payload 
   format, but are used additionally. This means that e.g. an RTP  
   retransmission packet could be composed as follows: 
    
       +-----------------------------------------------------+

       :                                                     : 
       :          Media Payload Type specific header         :   
       :                                                     : 
       +-----------------------------------------------------+ 
       |                                                     | 
       |                     Media Payload                   | 
       :                                                     : 
    
   The sender of RTP packets which wants to use the retransmission 
   capabilities has different possibilities at transmitting RTP 
   packets. For packets that are transmitted for the first time, the 
   sender MAY use the Selective (SEL) payload format. If so, it has the 
   possibility to signal the packet's priority and the sequence number 
   of the last high priority packet in band. This can be used at the 
   receiver of the packets to detect if the lost packet was high or low 
   priority. Low priority packets are usually not subject to 
    
    
     RTP Retransmission Payload Format                         July 2001     
    
    
   retransmissions and thus no retransmission request has to be sent 
   for low priority packets. 
    
   Retransmissions SHOULD be transmitted with the Retransmission (RTX) 
   payload format, because the RTX payload format specific header in 
   combination with the usual RTP header contains all information that 
   is needed at the receiver to detect lost retransmissions and 
   reconstruct the original packet (e.g. original sequence number or 
   timestamp). 
    
    
6  Retransmission Payload Format  
    
   Retransmissions in RTP SHOULD be sent with the RTX payload format. 
   This enables multiple retransmissions. The syntax of the header is 
   as follows: 
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    | X |   PT of original packet   | 
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    |(LSB) Delta RTP Sequence Number| 
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    :                               : 
    + MSB Delta RTP Sequence Number +  if X=1 
    :                               : 
    +...............................+ 
    
   Extended Delta Sequence Number (X): 1 bit 
     This bit indicates the used length of the Delta RTP Sequence  
     Number. For X=0 the least significant 8 bits of the Delta RTP  
     Sequence Number are transmitted, for X=1 24 bits are transmitted. 
    
   Payload Type of original packet: 7 bit 
     This field contains the original payload type information, i.e.  
     the payload type of the payload that is transported in this  
     packet. 
    
   (LSB) Delta RTP Sequence Number: 8 bit 
     This field contains the difference of this packet's RTP sequence  
     number to the RTP sequence number of the original transmission of  
     this packet's payload, calculated modulo 2^32,  
     i.e. Delta SN = (SN(this) _ SN(original)) mod 2^32.  
     If the number of bits that are needed to encode the difference  
     exceeds 8, X=1 MUST be set and the 16 most significant bits of the  
     24 bit Delta RTP Sequence Number are transmitted in the next  
     field. 
    
   MSB Delta RTP Sequence Number: 16 bit 
     For X=1 this field carries the 16 most significant bits of the  
     Delta RTP Sequence Number (see also "(LSB) Delta RTP Sequence  
     Number").

7  Selective Payload Format 
    
   In certain scenarios, e.g. environments with a very low bit rate 
   feedback channel, it is necessary to limit the feedback that is 
   sent. This can be done by the means of this selective (SEL) payload 
   type. If packets of a low priority are lost, the receiver does not 
   need to send feedback.  
    
   Still these packets are needed to detect the loss of high priority 
   packets, and therefore they contain the sequence number of the last 
   important packet that was sent. If the receiver gets a low priority 
   packet, it has only to verify if it has received the indicated last 
   important packet. Only for these packets retransmission requests 
   should be sent. The syntax of the packet is as follows: 
    
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    |DTI|   PT of original packet   | 
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    |PRI|       Delta SN            | 
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
    :                               : 
    +          Delta Time           + 
    :                               : 
    +...............................+ 
    
   DTI (Delta Time Indicator): 1 bit 
     DTI=1 indicates that the delta time field is present (i.e. the  
     payload format header has a size of 4 bytes. DTI=0 means that the  
     Delta Time field is not used and thus the header has a size of  
     2 bytes.  
    
   Payload Type of original packet: 7 bit 
     This field contains the original payload type information, i.e.  
     the payload type of the payload that is transported in this  
     packet. 
    
   PRI (Priority): 1 bit 
     This field indicates the priority of the packet. PRI=1 means a  
     high priority packet, where PRI=0 is sent for low priority  
     packets. 
    
   Delta SN (Delta Sequence Number): 7 bit 
     The offset in sequence number space to the previous important 
     packet. It is calculated as follows: DSN = SN_this - SN_important. 
    
   Delta Time: 15 bit 
     This field indicates the difference between the time stamp of the  
     last important RTP packet (that should be retransmitted if lost)  
     and that of the current RTP packet. It can be used by the receiver  
     to compute the timestamp of a lost important packet.

     The default unit of this field is [ms] and by default the  
     following table is used to encode the Delta Time values. 
    
    
          Delta Time [ms]  |    bits

                   -32766  | 1000 0000 0000 0010 
                   -32767  | 1000 0000 0000 0001 
         less than -32767  | 1000 0000 0000 0000 
    
     It is possible to define other units or coding tables, however, 
     how to specify and negotiate this is outside the scope of this 
     document. 
    
    
8  Feedback 
    
   Feedback is an important part of any retransmission scheme. To be 
   efficient, also under near real-time conditions, it might be needed 
   to receive this feedback with the lowest delay that is possible. The 
   basic RTP set constraints about feedback timing rules, which might 
   not be suitable for a retransmission scheme under real-time or near 
   real-time conditions. 
    
   To enable low delay feedback a new extended RTP profile was defined, 
   which redefines these timing rules according to the group size of 
   the multicast session. In unicast sessions it is possible to send 
   feedback virtually immediately. Hence this profile provides the 
   means to do enable low delay feedback which is needed for the 
   retransmission schemes. 
    
   In the Low Delay Feedback profile RTCP feedback messages are 
   defined, which are suited for retransmission requests or 
   acknowledgements. Generally a simple feedback message, called 
   general NACK is suitable to be used as a retransmission request. It 
   is defined in [4] as follows:

   The PID is used to indicate a lost packet for which the 
   retransmission is requested and the BLP might be used to indicate 
   several lost packets in one NACK message. A detailed description of 
   this and other low delay feedback messages can be found in [4]. 
    
    
9  Congestion Control 
    
   In general retransmission schemes contradict congestion control. If 
   packets are lost, which is generally accepted to be an indication of 
   congestion, the sender increases the network load by sending 
   additional retransmissions. While this behavior cannot be accepted 
   in best effort environments such as the Internet, it is reasonable 
   in quality of service (QoS) controlled networks, e.g by reserving a 
   certain bit rate for the RTP session. However the used bit rate MUST 
   be monitored to control that the maximum rate is by no means 
   exceeded. 
    
   Even though retransmission algorithms normally contradict congestion 
   control they could enhance the quality of service, in environments 
   where losses occur not only due to congestion but also (or mainly) 
   due to bit errors on the link. 
    
   Taking this information into account the following rule MUST be 
   followed, if the retransmissions are used in an best effort 
   environment (e.g. the Internet). 
    
   At reception of a retransmission request or detecting packet loss by 
   other means, the sender MUST NOT increase the sending bit rate on 
   mid term timescales. Retransmissions MAY be sent within the current 
   bit rate, e.g. by skipping or delaying the transmission of other 
   scheduled packets. 
 
   The rules for congestion control of [3] and [4] MUST be followed. 
    
10 A Multiple Retransmission Algorithm 
    
   This section gives an examples how the RTX payload format is used to 
   enable multiple retransmissions in RTP.

   The sender transmits the media data in normal RTP packets using an 
   RTP payload format for that media. If packets get lost the receiver 
   will detect that by the gap in the sequence number. To signal lost 
   packets the NACK message, described in section 8 is used. The PID 
   field is used to specify a lost packet. The default method, which is 
   to use the RTP sequence number to indicate the lost packet, is used. 
   The BLP field can be used to indicate several lost packets in one 
   NACK message. The detailed semantic is described in [4]. 
    
   At receiving a retransmission request the sender decides, according 
   to the priority of the packet, the network conditions (see 
   section 9) and maybe other factors, if the packet is to be 
   retransmitted. In case of a positive decision, it uses the RTX 
   payload format (see section 6) to retransmit the packet. The 
   sequence number of the RTP packet is increased by one over the 
   previous packet sent. This enables the receiver to detect also a 
   lost retransmission. 
    
   Example of a retransmission packet: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   :                         Media Payload                         : 
   :                                                               : 
    
    
11 A Selective Retransmission Algorithm  
    
   A special scenario, where the previously described multiple 
   retransmission algorithm does not work well, is if the feedback 
   channel has a very limited capacity. Possible scenarios are small 
   multicast groups, where it is according to the defined timing rules 
   for RTCP feedback seldom possible to send immediate feedback, or the 
   feedback channel is mainly used for other purposes (e.g. wireless 
   control channel) and has a very low bit rate available for RTCP 
   feedback. In this scenarios it is very important to limit the 
   feedback to the very minimum, which would mean that feedback is only 
   sent in form of retransmission requests for really important data. 
    
    
    
     RTP Retransmission Payload Format                         July 2001     
    
    
   To solve the above described requirements on the retransmission 
   scheme, it is necessary that the receiver knows the priority of the 
   lost packets, to decide if a retransmission request should be sent 
   or not. To do so at least two solutions apply: First the important 
   and non-important packets are sent in different streams, using a 
   different sequence number space. Second the selective packet format 
   is used.  
    
   There are scenarios where the first solution is applicable and thus 
   should be used, because it uses less overhead. However there are 
   drawbacks with this solution. Given that only very few high priority 
   packets are sent, e.g. once every 2 seconds, the time between 
   loosing a packet and detection of this packet loss is at least this 
   inter-packet time.  
    
   Hence in scenarios as described above, where feedback can be sent 
   only very infrequently, and thus only really important packets are 
   retransmitted, a solution which uses the selective payload format 
   might be the only possible solution at all. The mechanism works as 
   described in the following. 
    
   The sender sends all media data in RTP packets using the SEL payload 
   type plus additional the media payload type. The priority field is 
   set according to the packet's priority. In all packets the Delta SN 
   field is used to signal the delta to the sequence number of the 
   previous high priority packet. The receiver can use this information 
   to check if the last high priority packet was received correctly or 
   not. If this packet was not received or he cannot reliable detect 
   the priority of lost packets (if many packets were lost in a row), a 
   retransmission request is sent.  
    
   The receiver can also reconstruct the timestamp of the lost packet 
   if the sender used the Delta Time field. From this time information 
   it is possible to calculate the time after which the packet cannot 
   be used any more (display time). In this case the client should 
   maintain a round trip time (RTT) measurement and compare the 
   calculated display time with the estimated time when the 
   retransmission could arrive. If the retransmission would arrive 
   already outdated, a retransmission request should not be sent. 
   At receiving a retransmission request from the receiver, the server 
   has to make the same decision as described in the previous section, 
   i.e. it has to judge according to the packets priority (which is 
   most probably quite high, because a retransmission request for it 
   was sent), network status etc. if the packet should be 
   retransmitted. If so it uses the retransmission packet type, to 
   enable multiple retransmissions as described in the previous 
   section. However the SEL payload type is additionally used to enbale 
   the priority detection at the client.

   For the work on this retransmission framework, we received a lot of 
   help and advice from Colin Perkins. Especially the mechanism of 
   sending retransmissions with a new sequence number in the same 
   sequence number space, using a different payload type was his idea.
