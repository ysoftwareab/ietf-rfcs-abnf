Abstract

   This memo proposes a scheme that utilizes only pre-established bi-
   directional tunnels between LMA and MAGs to support a fast handover
   effectively in Proxy Mobile IPv6.  To expedite the handover
   procedure, we define new signaling messages, Fast PBU/PBA and Reverse
   PBU/PBA, exchanged by LMA and MAGs.  Because any signaling messages
   exchanged by two MAGs are neither created nor utilized and thus bi-
   directional tunnel between MAGs is not created, the proposed scheme
   puts less overload upon network than the existing fast handover
   scheme for PMIPv6.  It can also tackle effectively with the so-called
   ping-pong movement of mobile nodes.

Internet-Draft         Reverse Binding for PMIPv6              July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The PMIPv6 (Proxy Mobile IPv6) [RFC5213] protocol provides local
   mobility management to a mobile node without requiring any
   modification of the mobile node.  But, PMIPv6's handover could cause
   undesirable delay to the mobile nodes running real time applications
   like VoIP.  This memo proposes a scheme that supports a fast handover
   effectively in PMIPv6 by optimizing the associated data and signaling
   flows during the handover.

   FMIPv6 (Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6) [RFC5268] is a well-known fast
   handover scheme for the host-based Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], and its
   strategy has been also harnessed to enhance PMIPv6's handover
   performance.  Actually, a scheme has been proposed based on the
   FMIPv6's strategy (see [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6]).  Although
   the data transport of PMIPv6 utilizes the tunnelings from the LMA to
   the MAGs, not between MAGs, the FMIPv6 and the existing scheme
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6] still use the bi-directional tunnel
   between the previous MAG and new MAG to forward the data in transit
   during handover.  However, it includes unnecessary processing
   overhead to establish bi-directional tunnels between the MAGs.  Such
   a tunnel setup can also cause inefficient usage of network bandwidth
   if there are no direct secure links between them.

   In addition to that, the FMIPv6 and the existing scheme
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6] compell a mobile node's uplink
   traffic to be tunnelled to the previous MAG, and then again to the
   LMA in the cource of handover.  This zigzag path of data traffic can
   produce poor throughput.  Besides, as
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-transient-bce-pmipv6] mentioned, currently
   and as per PMIPv6 base protocol [RFC5268], the LMA forwards a mobile
   node's uplink traffic received from a tunnel only as long as the
   source IP address of the node's uplink traffic matches the IP address
   of the node's registered Proxy-CoA in the associated binding cache
   entry.  As a result, packets received at the LMA from the node's
   previous MAG after the LMA has already switched the tunnel to point
   to the new MAG will be dropped.

   We propose a new PMIPv6's fast handover scheme to overcome such
   ineffectiveness by defining new signaling messages, Fast PBU/PBA and
   Reverse PBU/PBA, exchanged between LAM and MAGs.  The proposed scheme
   utilizes only pre-established bi-directional tunnels between LMA and
   MAGs.  Because any signaling messages exchanged by two MAGs are
   neither created nor utilized and thus bi-directional tunnel between
   MAGs is not created, the proposed scheme puts less overload upon
   network than the existing fast handover scheme for PMIPv6.  It can
   also tackle effectively with the so-called ping-pong movement of
   mobile nodes.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213], in addition to the ones specified in this section:

   o  Previous Mobile Access Gateway (PMAG): The MAG that manages
      mobility related signaling for the MN before handover.

   o  New Mobile Access Gateway (NMAG): The MAG that manages mobility
      related signaling for the MN after handover.

   o  Previous Point of Attachment (P-PoA): The access network device to
      which the MN is attached before handover.

   o  New Point of Attachment (N-PoA): The access network device to
      which the MN is attached after handover.

   o  Fast Proxy Binding Update (Fast PBU): A request message sent by an
      MAG to a mobile node's LMA for expediting the handover procedure.

   o  Fast Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (Fast PBA): A reply message sent
      by the LMA in response to a Fast PBU message that it received from
      a MAG.

   o  Reverse Proxy Binding Update (Reverse PBU): A request message sent
      by the LMA to a mobile node's new MAG after establishing a binding
      between the home network prefix assigned to the mobile node and
      its new care-of address (Proxy-CoA).

   o  Reverse Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (Reverse PBA): A reply
      message sent by an MAG in response to a Reverse PBU message that
      it received from the LMA.


3.  Protocol Operation

   Because a mobile node is not directly involved with IPv6 mobility
   management, it is also unaware of fast handover procedure defined in
   this memo.  All new signaling messages defined in this memo are
   exchanged by MAGs and the LMA.

   To reduce the handover latency due to signaling between the MAGs and
   the LMA, this memo only utilizes the bi-directional tunnels between
   the LMA and the PMAG/NMAG.  That is, no tunnel creation between MAGs



Han, et al.              Expires January 9, 2010                [Page 4]

   is required.  The bi-directional tunnel between the LMA and the PMAG
   has been already established to provide a visited mobile node with
   the packet delivery service.  The bi-directional tunnel between the
   LMA and the NMAG may be also already established because the tunnels
   are shared for multiple mobile nodes in PMIPv6.  If there is no
   tunnel between the LMA and the NMAG, a new one should be created
   during the proposed procedure.  It is also recommended that the bi-
   directional tunnels between the LMA and all MAGs should be statically
   pre-established to make the proposed scheme operate efficiently.

   Figure 1 shows the procedure of the proposed scheme.

                     The proposed handover procedure.

                                 Figure 1

Internet-Draft         Reverse Binding for PMIPv6              July 2009


   The procedure is as follows (see Figure 1):

   (a)     A handover is imminent and a link-specific pre-handover
           procedure is performed.  The pre-handover procedure can be
           host-initiated or network-initiated.  The exact procedure is
           out of scope.

   (b)     P-PoA, to which the MN is currently attached, indicates the
           handover of the mobile node to the PMAG.  The exact procedure
           of this indication is also out of scope.

   (c)     The PMAG sends the Fast PBU to the LMA.  The Fast PBU message
           MUST include the MN ID and the new PCoA, the address of NMAG,
           which is resolved by the New AP ID.

   (d)     The LMA sends back the Fast PBA to the PMAG.

   (e)     The LMA establishes a binding between the home network prefix
           (HNP) assigned to the mobile node and its new PCoA.  The LMA
           sends the Reverse PBU to the NMAG.  The Reverse PBU message
           MUST include the MN ID and the HNP of the mobile node.

   (f)     The NMAG sends back the Reverse PBA to the LMA.

   (g)     If the bi-directional tunnel is not established between the
           NMAG and the LMA, a new tunnel is established.  The LMA
           starts to transfer packets destined for the mobile node via
           the NMAG.  If the mobile node has not established a
           connection with NMAG at this time, the NMAG starts to buffer
           the packets.

   (h)     The mobile node hands over to the New Access Network.

   (i)     The mobile node establishes a connection (e.g. radio channel)
           with the N-PoA, which in turn triggers the establishment of
           connection between the N-PoA and NMAG.  The exact procedure
           of this procedure is also out of scope.  When the NMAG does
           know that the MN makes the establishment of connection, it
           flushes out the buffered data.

   (j)     The NMAG sends the PBU message to the LMA.  This PBU message
           is sent by the procedure defined in PMIPv6.  However, since
           the PBU message is used by the LMA to check if the MN
           actually connects to the NMAG, the LMA does not have to send
           a response to the PBU message.

Internet-Draft         Reverse Binding for PMIPv6              July 2009


   (k)     The NMAG starts to transfer packets destined for the mobile
           node via the N-PoA.

   (l)     The uplink packets from the mobile node are sent to the NMAG
           via the N-PoA and the NMAG forwards them to the LMA.

   As the name implies, the reverse PBU message is sent by the LMA and
   the recipient of it is the NMAG.  Just before the LMA sends the
   reverse PBU message, it creates a new binding update list entry.
   Upon receiving it, the NMAG creates a new binding cache entry and
   establishes a new bi-directional tunnel if it does not exist.  After
   doing them, the NMAG replies to the LMA by sending the reverse PBA
   message.

   It is also noted that the Reverse PBU and PBA are the alternates of
   the original PBU and PBU of PMIPv6.  That is, the proposed scheme
   incorporates the main part of PMIPv6 procedure in the fast handover
   procedure, and thus any subsequent PMIPv6 procedure may be not
   necessary.  However, the NMAG sends the PBU message to the LMA in
   order for the LMA to check if the MN actually connects to the NMAG.
   However, any response to the PBU message is not required.


4.  Binding Cache Entry Management

   The use of Fast PBU/PBA and Reverse PBU/PBA during an MN's handover
   enables a great control on the fast update of the MN's binding cache
   entry at LMA and the fast forwarding to the NMAG for the traffic
   destined for the MN.  When the LMA sends the Reverse PBU to an MN's
   NMAG and receives the Reverse PBA from the NMAG, it creates a
   transient binding cache entry for the MN.  A transient binding cache
   entry is identical to a normal PMIPv6 binding cache entry except that
   it could be deleted if the LMA does not receive a normal PMIPv6 PBU
   from the NMAG within a predefined time.  That is, a transient binding
   cache entry has a lifetime associated and its deletion does not need
   any signaling.

   The LMA should maintain the status of an MN's binding and the
   lifetime associated with a transient binding cache entry in their
   binding cache.  TIMEOUT is set according to the Lifetime value in a
   Reverse PBU.  If the LMA receives a normal PMIPv6 PBU from the NMAG
   within the lifetime, the transient binding cache entry changes to the
   normal binding cache entry.
