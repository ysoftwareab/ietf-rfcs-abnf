INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


1. Introduction

   XML, the Extensible Markup Language, is a syntactical standard
   elaborated by the W3C XML Activity, which produced the first
   recommendation on February 10, 1998. XML is a subset of an existing
   and widely used international text processing standard known as SGML
   (Standard Generalized Markup Language). XML is intended primarily for
   structuring data exchanged and served over the World Wide Web.

   As it is anticipated that XML will be widely used in the exchange of
   business and commercial data, and it has been already established
   that digital signatures will play an important role in enabling
   electronic commerce, the necessity to promote a digital signature
   standard for general XML documents becomes evident.

   Drafted with IOTP (Internet Open Trading Protocol) requirements in
   mind, this document has been further enhanced as comments were
   received and alternative proposals disclosed. It is now expected that
   it provides a more general solution to signing XML documents.



2. Objective and Requirements

   The objective of this document is to propose syntax and procedures
   for the computation and verification of digital signatures applicable
   to general XML documents.

   This proposal has been established in light of the requirements that
   have been gathered while reviewing diverse projects and alternative
   approaches such as IOTP [draft-ietf-trade-iotp-v1.0-protocol-*.txt],
   eCheck [x], BIPS [x], SDML [x], and XMLDSIG [x]. The following
   requirements have been identified:

   1. The solution shall provide a means for building authentication
      into XML applications, but shall also propose an XML alternative
      to binary signature syntax for signing arbitrary contents.

   2. The solution shall provide indifferently for digital signature and
      message authentication codes, considering symmetric and asymmetric
      authentication schemes as well as dynamic negotiation of keying
      material.

   3. The solution shall provide a mechanism that eases the production
      of composite documents that consist of the combination by addition
      or deletion of authenticated blocks of information, while
      preserving verifiability of the origin and authenticity of these
      blocks of information.

   4. The solution shall enable authentication of part or totality of an


Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


      XML document.

   5. The solution shall enable authentication of internal and external
      resources.

   6. The solution shall provide for extended signature functionality
      such as co-signature, endorsement, plurality of recipients, etc.



3. Signature Basics

   This specification consists primarily of the definition of an XML
   element known as the Signature element. This element is comprised of
   two sub-elements. The first one is a set of authenticated attributes,
   known as the signature Manifest, which comprises such things as a
   unique reference to the resource being authenticated and an
   indication of the keying material and algorithms being used. The
   second sub-element consists of the digital signature value.

      <Signature>
          <Manifest>
              (resource information block)
              (originator information block)
              (recipient information block)
              (other attributes)
              (signature algorithms information block)
          </Manifest>
          <Value encoding= "encoding scheme">
              (encoded signature value)
          <Value>
      </Signature>

   The digital signature is not computed directly from the pieces of
   information to be authenticated. Instead, the digital signature is
   computed from a set of authenticated attributes (the Manifest), which
   include a reference to, and a digest of, these pieces of information.
   The authentication is therefore "indirect".



3.1 Resource Element

   The Resource element consists of a unique and unambiguous reference
   to the resource being authenticated. It is constructed of a locator,
   a fingerprint, and optionally a content-type qualifier.

INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   <Resource>
       <Locator href= "resource locator"/>
       <ContentType type= "type qualifier"/>
       <Digest>
           <DigestAlgorithms>
               <Canonicalizer>
                   (algorithm information block)
               </Canonicalizer>
               <DigestAlgorithm>
                   (algorithm information block)
               </DigestAlgorithm>
           </DigestAlgorithms>
           <Value encoding= "encoding scheme">
               (encoded digest value)
           </Value>
       </Digest>
   </Resource>

   The resource locator is implemented as a simple XML Link[x]. This not
   only provides a unique addressing scheme for internal and external
   resources, but also facilitates authentication of composite documents
   (see section 4.4).  Besides the digest algorithm, the Digest element
   provides for a canonicalizer.  This algorithm ensures consistency of
   the information being digested by extracting its core semantic.
   Changes in the external representation of a piece of information
   shall not affect its canonical representation.



3.2 Originator and Recipient Information Elements

   The purpose of the Originator and Recipient information elements
   consists of providing identification and keying material for these
   respective parties.

      <OriginatorInfo>
          (identification information block)
          (keying material information block)
      </OriginatorInfo>

      <RecipientInfo>
          (identification information block)
          (keying material information block)
      </RecipientInfo>

   The actual content of these two elements depends on the
   authentication scheme being used and the existence or non-existence
   of a prior relationship between the parties. In some circumstances,
   it may be quite difficult to distinguish between identification and
   keying material information. A unique reference to a digital


Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 6]


INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   certificate provides for both. This may also stand true for an
   account number when a prior relationship exists between the parties.

   The Originator information element is mandatory. Depending on the
   existence or non-existence of a prior relationship with the
   recipient, this block either refers to a public credential such as a
   digital certificate or displays a unique identifier known by the
   recipient.

   The Recipient information element may be used when a document
   contains multiple signature information blocks, each being intended
   for a particular recipient.  A unique reference in the Recipient
   information block helps the recipients identify their respective
   Signature information block.

   The Recipient information element may also be used when determination
   of the authentication key consists of a combination of keying
   material provided by both parties. This would be the case, for
   example, when establishing a key by means of Diffie Hellman[x] Key
   Exchange algorithm.



3.3 Other Attributes

   The Attributes element consists of a collection of Attribute elements
   that could be used for inserting specific pieces of information
   directly into the Signature element. An Attribute element is
   constructed of a type, a criticality, and a value.

      <Attributes>
          <Attribute type= "signing-time" critical= "true">
              <Date value="1998-10-28T08:15-0500">
          </Attribute>
          <Attribute type= "private-type" critical= "false">
              (ANY attribute value)
          </Attribute>
      </Attributes>

   The attribute value consists of ANY content that is defined in the
   application DTD. Nevertheless, to facilitate the adoption of
   "standard" attributes, the Signature DTD provides for common types
   such as "signing-time".



3.4 Signature Algorithms Element

   The Signature Algorithms element indicates the algorithms to be used
   for computation of the signature value. This element indicates not


Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 7]


INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   only the signature algorithm but also a canonicalizer and an optional
   key-agreement algorithm.

      <SignatureAlgorithms>
          <Canonicalizer>
              (algorithm information block)
          </Canonicalizer>
          <KeyAgreementAlgorithm>
              (algorithm information block)
          </KeyAgreementAlgorithm>
          <SignatureAlgorithm>
              (algorithm information block)
          </SignatureAlgorithm>
      </SignatureAlgorithms>

   In consideration of the requirements stated previously, this document
   uses the terminology of "signature" for qualifying indifferently
   signature and authentication schemes. Therefore, the signature
   algorithm mentioned above might refer to a signature algorithm such
   as DSS or to a message authentication code (MAC) such as HMAC.

   The key-agreement algorithm may be used for deriving a one-time
   session key from an established master key. Usage of one-time session
   key prevents some kinds of attack that require a large volume of
   cipher-text to be produced by a given key.



4. Signature Principles



4.1 Enabling Signature in XML Applications

   As mentioned previously, this proposal shall provide a means for
   building authentication into general XML applications. The mechanism
   adopted herein considers the "XML Namespaces" specifications[x],
   which define the requirements for combining multiple DTDs or parts of
   individual DTD into a single document.

   According to these specifications, an XML application can build
   digital signature support by referring explicitly to the elements
   defined in the Signature DTD. This is accomplished by associating a
   namespace prefix to the Signature DTD and qualifying Signature
   element names by means of this prefix.  Association of a namespace
   prefix to a DTD shall be done by means of a xmlns attribute, which
   could appear in any element that either refers to or contains sub-
   elements that refer to elements of the DTD considered. A qualified
   name consists of a namespace prefix, a colon, and a name.



Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   <Document xmlns:dsig=" Signature-DTD-URI">

       <Element id=" Element" ...>
           <SubElement ...>
               ...
           </SubElement>
               ...
       </Element>
       <dsig:Signature>
           <Manifest>
               <Resource>
                   <Locator href=" #Element"/>
                   ...
               </Resource>
               ...
           </Manifest>
           <Value>
               ...
           </Value>
       </dsig:Signature>
   </Document>

   [The XML Namespaces specifications are still work in progress at W3C.
   A final draft should be available soon, as the specifications entered
   "last call" September 16, 1998.

   There are still a few unknowns regarding combination of DTD and use
   of qualified names in an application DTD that inherits definitions
   from another DTD. The current paragraph will be developed, as
   clarifications will be obtained.]



4.2 Encapsulating Arbitrary Contents

   To facilitate encapsulation of arbitrary contents into an XML
   document, the Signature DTD defines a Package element. Quite similar
   to a MIME wrapper, this element provides for such things as content
   type and content encoding.

      <Package>
           <ContentType type= "type qualifier"/>
           <Value encoding= "encoding scheme">
                (safe content)
           </Value>
      </Package>

   Though it addresses a similar purpose, the Package element specified
   by this draft proposal is radically different from the one given in
   the " XML Pack- age" proposal[x]. Such decision has been driven by


Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 9]


INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   the possibility to leverage other element definitions of this DTD.
   However, the current definition might be amended in time if the
   Package proposal were to be adopted.



4.3 Implementing Endorsement

   Endorsement consists of signing another signature. To facilitate
   endorsement, the definition of the Signature element provides for an
   element identifier attribute, which can be used to target a Signature
   element from a Resource element.

   <Signature id=" Signature">
       <Manifest>
           <Resource>
               <Locator href=" resource locator"/>
               ...
           </Resource>
           ...
       </Manifest>
       ...
   </Signature>

   <Signature id=" CounterSignature">
       <Manifest>
           <Resource
               <Locator href="# Signature"/>
               ...
           </Resource>
           ...
       </Manifest>
       ...
   </Signature>



4.4 Supporting Composite Documents

   Some protocols consist of the exchange of documents that result from
   the combination by addition or deletion of common information blocks.
   This proposal preserves verifiability of the origin and authenticity
   of these blocks of information as they are exchanged between parties.

   To facilitate creation and verifiability of composite documents, the
   current draft proposal has adopted an element, known as the Resources
   element, which consist of a collection of Resource elements. The
   authentication of the Resources element is sufficient for ensuring
   proper authentication of the blocks of information that it
   references, and verifiability is preserved when individual blocks of


Richard D. Brown                                               [Page 10]


INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   information are missing.

      <Block id=" Block01">
          ...
      </Block>

      <Block id=" Block02">
          ...
      </Block>

      <Resources id=" Resources">
          <Resource>
              <Locator href="# Block01"/>
              ...
          </Resource>
          <Resource>
              <Locator href="# Block02">
              ...
          </Resource>
      </Resources>

      <Signature>
          <Manifest>
              <Resource>
                  <Locator href="# Resources">
                  ...
              </Resource>
              ...
          </Manifest
          ...
      </Signature>

   The adoption of simple XML links as resource locators makes possible
   the authentication of composite documents. If IDREFs were used
   instead, it would have been impossible to ensure validity of partial
   documents - some IDREFs could have been left referencing non-embedded
   IDs.



4.5 Facilitating One-pass Processing

   Without further definitions, it would be impossible to determine
   which blocks of information require authentication and which
   algorithms need to be employed before interpretation of the Resource
   elements. These elements being generally located at the end of the
   document, this restriction would prevent computation of the digests
   during acquisition of the blocks of information.

   To facilitate one-pass processing, this specification uses another


Richard D. Brown                                               [Page 11]


INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   functionality offered by the namespaces proposal. This functionality
   provides for the definition of global attributes that may be used and
   recognized across multiple elements. This document specifies the
   dsig:hash global attribute, which could be used for identifying the
   blocks of information to be authenticated. This attribute shall
   reference a Digest Algorithms element, which should be declared
   before making use of the attribute.

   <Document xmlns:dsig=" Signature-DTD-URI">

       <dsig:DigestAlgorithms id=" Algorithms">
       ...
       </dsig:DigestAlgorithms>

       <AuthenticatedBlock id=" AuthBlock"
           dsig:hash="Algorithms">
           ...
       </AuthenticatedBlock>

       <dsig:Signature>
           <Manifest>
               <Resource>
                   <Locator href="# AuthBlock">
                   ...
               </Resource>
               ...
           </Manifest>
           ...
       </dsig:Signature>

   </Document>

   When encountering the dsig:hash global attribute on the Authenticated
   Block element, the XML parser is immediately aware of the requirement
   of computing the digest of this element. All the pieces of
   information necessary for such computation are provided by the Digest
   Algorithms element referenced by the attribute.



5. Detailed Signature Syntax

   Though it is expected that Signature support will be primarily built
   into general XML applications by incorporating definitions of the
   Signature DTD into other XML applications, the Signature DTD defines
   the elements necessary to providing an XML alternative to binary
   signature syntaxes.

INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


5.1 Namespace Attributes

   All the elements defined by the Signature DTD are explicitly bound to
   the XMLDSIG namespace by means of a dsig prefix. In order to make
   sure that every element could be individually imported by other XML
   applications, the element definitions given hereinafter
   systematically declare a fixed xmlns:dsig attribute.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:element definition...>

      <!ATTLIST dsig:element
          xmlns:dsig CDATA #FIXED %xmldsig.dtd;
          ...
      >

   Recall that many XML applications, presumably including namespaces-
   sensitive ones, fail to require validating processors. For correct
   operation with such applications, namespaces declarations must be
   also provided either directly or via default attributes declared in
   the internal subset of the DTD.



5.2 dsig:hash Global Attribute

   As mentioned previously, this draft proposal specifies a dsig:hash
   global attribute that could be used for identifying a block of
   information to be authenticated.  This attribute shall refer to a
   Digest Algorithms element, which should be declared before making use
   of the attribute.

   The XML Namespaces specifications do not explicitly provide for
   declaration of global attributes. Distinguishing between global
   attributes and element attributes exists only in the prose
   description of such attributes. An essential property of global
   attributes consists nonetheless of the uniqueness of their name that
   is independent of the elements where they are defined.

   The definition of elements that could be subject to authentication
   may define the dsig:hash attribute as follows:

      <!ELEMENT element definition...>

      <!ATTLIST element
          dsig:hash IDREF #IMPLIED
      >

   Recall that the namespace prefix that is bound to the XMLDSIG
   namespace shall be defined before being employed. However, such
   definition may occur in the element that defines the dsig:hash

   attribute.

   The reader shall notice that the terminology "dsig:hash" is
   inappropriate and used solely for illustrative purposes. This simply
   means that the name of this attribute is hash and it belongs to the
   XMLDSIG namespace (whatever prefix is used).



5.3 Document

   The Document element constitutes the outermost envelope of an XML
   document that conforms to the Signature DTD. The definition of this
   element has been intentionally kept simple and is only intended to
   provide an XML alternative to the ASN1 data types Authenticated Data
   and Signed Data defined by CMS[x] and PKCS7[x] binary syntax
   standards.

   It is expected that this simple, though complete, definition will
   help the adoption of this proposal and facilitate the production of
   conformant implementations by a plurality of providers. This
   definition does not preclude however the definition of more
   sophisticated constructions to be adopted by particular XML
   applications. Such applications may either redefine the Document
   element or promote their own DTD, which shall be partially
   constructed of elements defined by the Signature DTD.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:Document (
          ( dsig:DigestAlgorithms, dsig:Package )?,
          dsig:Signatures, dsig:Certificates?
      )>

      <!ATTLIST dsig:Document
          xmlns:dsig CDATA   #FIXED   %xmldsig.dtd;
      >

   The definition given above has been deemed sufficient for
   implementing the following functionality provided by CMS or PKCS7:
   -- Authentication of arbitrary contents: This may be done by adequate
      en-capsulation and encoding of the arbitrary contents into the
      Package ele-ment, which shall be further authenticated by means of
      a Signature ele-ment.
   -- Detached signature: This may be done by means of a Signature
      element that refers to a resource external to the document.
   -- Authentication versus signature: The distinction between
      authentication and signature only depends upon the algorithms
      being employed for computation of the "signature" value.
   -- Plurality of recipients: This consists of the insertion of a
      plurality of Sig-nature elements, each making use of recipient-
      dependent keying mate-rial.

   -- Plurality of signers: This consists of the insertion of a
      plurality of Signature elements, each making use of originator-
      dependent keying material.

   Content Description

      DigestAlgorithms: This element has been made mandatory whenever
           the document embeds the contents to be authenticated. This
           element specifies the algorithms to be used for computation
           of the digest of the Package element, thus enabling one-pass
           processing.

      Package:  This element is used for enveloping and encoding of the
           contents to be authenticated.  Whenever employed, this
           element shall make use of the dsig:hash global attribute to
           refer to the Digest Algorithms element described above.

      Signatures:  This element consists of a collection of Signature
           elements.

      Certificates:  This element consists of a collection of
           Certificate elements, which may be required by a given key
           management infrastructure.

   The definition of collection elements (i.e. Certificates and
   Signatures) for the sole purpose of grouping similar sub-elements has
   been adopted for facilitat- ing DOM manipulations.



5.4 DigestAlgorithms

   The purpose of the DigestAlgorithms element consists of specifying
   the algorithms to be employed in the computation of a message digest.
   This element is used either as a standalone element for enabling
   one-pass processing or as a sub-element of the Digest element.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:DigestAlgorithms (
          dsig:Canonicalizer?, dsig:DigestAlgorithm

           the digest value is computed on the surface string of the
           content value.

      DigestAlgorithm:  Algorithm to be used for computation of the
           Digest value (cf. Supported Algorithms)

   Attributes Description

      id:  Element identifier that is used on standalone element for
           enabling reference by the dsig:hash global attribute.



5.5 Package

   The Package element enables encapsulation of an arbitrary content
   into an XML document. Behaving like a MIME wrapper, the Package
   element provides for such things as content type identification and
   content encoding.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:Package (
          dsig:ContentType?, dsig:Value
      )>

      <!ATTLIST dsig:Package

          id            ID       #IMPLIED
      >

   Content Description

      ContentType:  Type qualifier for the content.

           Value:  Content value.

   Attributes Description

      id: Element identifier that could be used for referencing this
           element from a Resource element.



5.6 ContentType

   The purpose of the ContentType element is to describe a given content
   such that a receiving user agent can deal with the data in an
   appropriate manner.

   Attributes Description

      type:  Type of the content. In order to prevent potential conflict
           in the definition of content types, this draft proposal makes
           use of Universal Resource Names[x] (cf. Supported Content
           Types).

   Content Description

      PCDATA:  Content value after adequate encoding.

   Attributes Description

      encoding:  This attribute specifies the decoding scheme to be
           employed for recovering the original byte stream from the
           content of the element. The current draft proposal recognizes
           the following two schemes:

           none: the content has not been subject to any particular
           encoding. This does not preclude however the use of native
           XML encoding such as CDATA section or XML escaping.

           base64: The content has been encoded by means of the base64
           encoding scheme (cf.  Supported Algorithms)



5.8 Signatures

   The Signatures element consists of a collection of Signature
   elements. As mentioned in a previous paragraph, this element has been
   defined for the sole purpose of facilitating DOM manipulations.

   specify such things as a unique reference to the resource being
   authenticated and an indication of the keying material and algorithms
   to be used. The Manifest actually constitutes the authenticated part
   of the document.

5.21 Attribute

   The Attribute element consists of a complementary piece of
   information, which shall be included in the authenticated part of the
   document. Though the current draft proposal defines well-known
   attributes, this element has been defined primarily for enabling some
   level of customization in the signature element. An Attribute element
   consists of a value, a type, and a criticality.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:Attribute ANY>

          critical ( true | false ) #REQUIRED    'false'
      >

   Content Description

      ANY: The actual value of an attribute depends solely upon its
           type.

   Attributes Description

      type:  Type of the attribute. In order to prevent potential
           conflict in the definition of the attribute types, this draft
           proposal makes use of Universal Resource Names[x].

      critical: Boolean value that indicates if the attribute is
           critical (true) or not (false). A recipient shall reject a
           signature that contains a critical attribute that he does not
           recognize. However, an unrecognized non-critical attribute
           may be ignored.

   Signing-time Attribute

      Standard attribute that could be used for specifying the time at
      which the originator purportedly performed the signature process.
      This attribute content shall be given as a Date element (cf.
      element description). The type identifier of this attribute is
      given in the URN appendix.



5.22 Date

   The Date element consists of a constrained ISO 8601:1998 date and
   time value.

   Attributes Description

      value:  Identification data value.

   Date Format

      The current draft proposal requires date values to be expressed
           according to the following pattern: YYYY '-' MM '-' DD 'T' hh
           ':' mm [':' ss ['.' f+]]('+' | '-') hhmm

      YYYY:  four-digit year
      MM:    two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
      DD:    two-digit day of the month (01-31)
      hh:    two digits of hour (00-23)
      mm:    two digits of minute (00-59)
      ss:    two digits of second (00-59) optional
      f:     digit(s) of fractions of second - optional
      zzzz:  four digits of amount of offset from UTC expressed in hour
           (00-11) and minute (00-59)

      For example "1994-11-05T16:15:02.031-0500" denotes November 5,
           1994, 4:15:02 pm and 31 milliseconds, US Eastern Standard
           Time.



5.23 SignatureAlgorithms

   The SignatureAlgorithms element is used for specifying the algorithms
   to be used for computation of the signature value.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:SignatureAlgorithms (
          dsig:Canonicalizer,
          dsig:KeyAgreementAlgorithm?,
          dsig:SignatureAlgorithm
      )>

      <!ATTLIST dsig:SignatureAlgorithms
          xmlns:dsig    PCDATA    #FIXED    %xmldsig.dtd;

INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


      Canonicalizer:  Algorithm to be used for normalizing the content
           to be authenticated (cf. Supported Algorithms).

      KeyAgreementAlgorithm:  Optional algorithm that could be used for
           deriving a one-time session key from an established master
           key (cf. Supported Algorithms).

      SignatureAlgorithm:  Algorithm to be used for computation of the
           signature value (cf. Supported Algorithms).



5.24 Certificates

   The Certificates element consists of a collection of Certificate
   elements. The Certificate elements contained in this element are
   intended to be sufficient to make chains from the originator
   credential(s) to a recognized "certification authority" for all the
   recipients. However, this element may contain more Certificate
   elements than necessary or, alternatively, less than necessary if it
   is known that recipients have an alternate means of obtaining
   necessary certificates.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:Certificates ( dsig:Certificate+ )>

      <!ATTLIST dsig:Certificates
          xmlns:dsig    CDATA    #FIXED    %xmldsig.dtd;
      >

   Content Description

      Certificate:  A collection of Certificate elements.



5.25 Certificate

   The Certificate element may be used for either providing the value of
   a digital certificate or specifying a location from where it may be
   retrieved.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:Certificate (
          dsig:IssuerAndSerialNumber,
          ( dsig:Value | dsig:Locator )
      )>

      <!ATTLIST dsig:Certificate
          xmlns:disg    CDATA      #FIXED    %xmldsig.dtd;
          type          NMTOKEN    #REQUIRED
      >

INTERNET-DRAFT               November 1998    Digital Signatures for XML


   Content Description

      IssuerAndSerialNumber:  Unique identifier of this certificate. This element
           has been made mandatory is order to prevent
           unnecessary decoding during validation of a
           certificate chain. This feature also helps
           certificates caching, especially when the value
           is not directly provided.

      Value:  Encoding of the certificate value. The actual
           value to be encoded depends upon the type of
           the certificate (cf. Certificate Supplement).

      Locator: XML link element that could be used for
           retrieving a copy of the digital certificate. The
           actual value being returned by means of this
           locator depends upon the protocol being used
           (i.e. http versus ldap) (cf. Certificate
           Supplement).

   Attributes Description

      type:  Type of the digital certificate. This attribute is
           specified as a Universal Resource Name (cf.
           Certificate Supplement).



5.26 Resources

   The Resources element consists of a collection of Resource elements.
   Though inaccessible from the Document element of the Signature DTD, this
   element is available to more sophisticated constructs that make use of com-posite
   documents.

      <!ELEMENT dsig:Resources ( dsig:Resource+ )>

      <!ATTLIST Resources
          xmlns:disg    CDATA    #FIXED    %xmldsig.dtd;
          dsig:hash     IDREF    #IMPLIED
          id            ID       #IMPLIED
      >

   Content Description

      Resource:  A collection of Resource elements.  Attributes
           Description

      id: Element identifier that could be used for referencing this
           element from a Resource element.
