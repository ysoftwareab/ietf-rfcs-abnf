Abstract

   This document proposes a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference
   Platform which can support a lot of meetings simultaneously. It
   designs a new distributed conference architecture. In this
   architecture the component called MCS is responsible for the process
   of media data including audio and video. Some conference UEs which
   have enough bandwidth or other conditions could also undertake parts
   of media data process. All the MCSs form the reload overlay. The
   capacity and state information of conference UEs is stored in the
   RELOAD overlay. One or several MCSs will be selected to provide media
   process for a meeting  and these MCSs process all the  transcoding
   and transmission of audio and video data, and decide which media
   process task could be assigned to Conference UEs.

1. Introduction

   In traditional video conference architecture, performance and
   capacity of single server is limited. It can only support a certain
   number of online users simultaneously. Large scale conference systems
   need to deploy a lot of servers to process audio and video data, this
   point would be the bottleneck. As the network environment and
   hardware ability of UEs become better and better, so making full use
   of the ability of UEs to help processing parts of media data is very
   useful.

   In this draft, the video conference platform is suitable for the
   following scenario. This platform could be run by operator and
   support many meetings simultaneously; for a single meeting the number
   of participants is relatively small.

   Considering the above scenario, the scheme of traditional video
   conference system need deploy many servers to process media data, a
   very high cost.

   Therefore, we introduced the Distributed Conference Media Processing.
   On the basis of traditional software video conferencing, our project
   makes full use of UEs to undertake parts of the task of audio and
   video processing to reduce the server bandwidth and hardware
   resources cost.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   The terminology and definitions from the RELOAD base[I-D.ietf-p2psip-
   base], the peer-to-peer SIP concepts draft[I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts].

   MCS: Media Control Server is responsible for the process of media
   data including transmission or transcoding  all the MCS constitute a
   Reload overlay. The capacity and state information of conference UEs
   is stored in the RELOAD overlay.

   UE: User Equipment can execute the conference operation as a client.

   CCS: Conference Control Server mainly handle UE online state and
   other conference functions such as instant message  and it will
   assigns suitable MCS to UE when they join a conference.

   CDB: Conference Database mainly maintains static User and conference
   information.

   Owner MCS: Owner MCS stores conference information in the RELOAD
   overlay.

   Service MCS: CCS assigns one Service MCS to every UE, which is
   responsible for handling the UE's media request.

3. System overview

3.1. Architecture

   This section defines the overall architecture and the main functions
   of each entity. Figure 1 depicts the network architecture based on
   Reload overlay which consists of a set of cooperating peers. The main
   functions of the core network are provided by the overlay in which
   the peers can efficiently route messages to other peers and
   efficiently store and retrieve conference information.

   CCS and CDB is the system manager, and CDB is a centralized user
   database.

   MCS is a media processing server. Each MCS is a peer in the Reload
   overlay, and the capacity and state information of conference UEs is
   the resources. Each UE is a client in the reload overlay.

   In addition, UE in different network may be assigned to different MCS
   to access. The MCSs will be deployed in different networks too, So
   that the system will choose a proximal MCS for the UEs to process
   their media data.

3.2. Entities

   The following part includes a description of each major functional
   entity in distributed video conference system, and a brief
   introduction of each entity's behaviors and interactions with other
   entities.

3.2.1. CCS (Conference Control Server)

   According to the scale of UE, there may be several CCS servers in the
   conference system. The main functions include:

   o Responsibility for authorization and maintaining online
      information of UE;

   o UE Management of participating in a conference.

3.2.2. CDB (Conference Database)

   There is only one CDB in system. The main functions may include:

   o Store and maintain conference and UE static information;

   o IP address and location information of MCS in the system

   o Accept request from CCS and return the relative data to MCS;

3.2.3. MCS (Media Control Server)

   According to the scale of UEs, there may be many MCS in system. The
   main functions may include:

   o Receive audio and video data from UEs, and transmit it to other UE
      who send a request.

   o Based on requirement mix the audio and video streaming or convert
      BitRate;

   o Maintain and manage capability and state information of UEs in a
      conference, and execute distributed algorithm;

   o Every MCS have only one identity and adopt Reload protocol to look
      up each other.

3.2.4. UE (User Equipment)

   UE include the types of PC, mobile telephone, Set-Top Box, MID, etc.
   The main functions may include:

   o Initialization, join, exit and other operation about a conference;

   o Receive and send audio and video data.

   o Some UEs may be selected by MCSs to undertake the tasks of
      transmit media data.

3.3. Kind data structure

   Each DcmpRegistration data structure stores each UE the related
   performance parameter and which MCS is service for this UE. The data
   structure uses the RELOAD dictionary type whereas the Dictionary Key-
   value is the Node-ID behind the dictionary entry. The data structure
   of type DcmpRegistration is shown as follows:

         struct {

            DictionaryKey   UE_ID;

            DataValue       delay;

           } DictionaryEntry;



         struct {

            opaque          UE_CPU <0..2^16-1>;

            opaque          UE_Memory <0..2^16-1>;

            opaque          UE_UpBW <0..2^16-1>;

            opaque          UE_DownBW <0..2^16-1>;

            opaque          UE_BitRate <0..2^16-1>;

            DictionaryEntry UE_delay;

          } Performance;



          struct {

            uint16          length;

            uint128         MCS_ID;

            bool            flag;

            Performance     performance_data;

          } DcmpRegistration;

   The content of the DcmpRegistration structure are as follows:

          length

             the length of the registration PDU

          MCS_ID

             MCS serviced for this UE

          flag

             mark of whether UE assume the task of media processing

          performance_data

             performance parameter about this UE.

   Performance_data define as follows:

   o Assume that a conference has n UEs, each UE is numbered from 1 to
      n; the CPU capacity of each UE is defined as UE_CPU, memory
      capacity is defined as UE_Memory, upload bandwidth is defined as
      UE_UpBW, download bandwidth is defined as UE_DownBW, video bit
      rate is defined as UE_BitRate;

   o Delay between itself and other UE in the same conference is
      defined as UE_delay;

   Data stored in this structure is used for optimizing media
   transmission.

                      Figure 2 Creation a conference

   UE1 set the conference name, type, the number of participant and
   other information, then sent conference creation request to the CCS;

   In this procedure, CDB just store the attribute of the conference.
   When new entrant comes CCS stores the additional information in CDB.
   See more in 4.2.

4.2. Participate in a conference

   In this scenario, UE1 will participate in an existing conference.

   UE1 sent the join request to CCS. The request should contain the
   conference ID. CCS takes the conference ID as keyword to request the
   relative data from CDB.

   According to the information returned by the CDB, CCS will choose a
   proper MCS as UE's service MCS based on geographical information.
   Then CCS update the relative information, including the MCS that
   service for the same conference and the number of UE serviced by each
   MCS, also including UEs that has joined in the same conference.

   UE1 receive the assignment result, and then establishes a connection

   In this scene assuming that UE1 and UE3 have already joined in the
   meeting UE2 is a new entrant and its service MCS is MCS2.

   UE2 get the UE list of the same conference and need to detect its own
   status and measure the delay between other UE and itself, and then
   stored them in the overlay in DcmpRegistration.

   UE2 will detect its own state parameters including: CPU capacity is
   defined as UECPU, the memory capacity is defined as UEMemory, uplaod
   bandwidth is defined as UEUpBW, the download bandwidth is defined as
   UEDownBW, video bit rate is defined as the UE_BitRate(bit)  delay
   between itself and other UEs: UEDelay (UE2, UE1), UEDelay (UE2, UE3).

   UEs which have joined in a meeting need to detect some parameters
   When new UE join or detect periodically.

5. Media Process Mechanism

   This section describes the handling mechanism of audio and video
   stream data in the distributed conference platform.

5.1. Audio Stream Process

5.1.1. Audio Mixer Selection

   In the distributed conference platform, audio streams of UEs could be
   mixed together and then transmitted to each UE This is called audio
   mixing mode which is optional. For the mode in which the audio
   streams are not mixed will not be considered in current version. The
   following part of this section will focus on the mechanism of audio
   mixing mode. If capable UEs exist, one of them will be selected to
   mix the audio streams. The solution of Choosing Several UEs could be
   considered, but it is beyond the scope of current version.

   The MCS server assigned to UE who is the first to join the conference
   will be responsible for the decision of UE selection. The
   determination should incorporate with bandwidth, chip ability and
   other conditions. If there is no suitable UE to be selected The MCS
   server will be responsible for audio mixing itself. When the mixing
   node failed for some reasons, the MCS server will take over the task
   or choose new UE to do the job.

   As an example, Figure 6 showed the audio-mixing node selection
   procedure.

      Figure 6 Selection of audio-mix peer in a Distributed Conference

   In this case, UE3 joined in the conference which UE1 and UE2 have
   already join. MSC1 is responsible to decide the proper UE to
   undertake the audio mixing task. In the first phrase there is no UE
   selected as mixing node, so MSC1 will be responsible for audio mixing.

   1. UE3 registers in the conference and stores its information to the
   overlay through MCS2;

   2. MCS2 informs MCS1 that a new node UE3 joined in the conference;

   3. MCS1 fetches current UE list from overlay which include the
   ability information of all UEs;

   4. After check of node capacity MCS1 find UE3 could be selected as
   mixing node.

   5. MCS1 will notices UE3 the selection result. UE3 gives acknowledge
   response;

   6. MCS1 informs UE1 and UE2 the new audio mixing node is UE3;

   7. UE1 and UE2 will send their audio stream data to UE3.

5.1.2. Audio Mixer Transmission

   After selecting the audio mixer, all the UEs firstly sends their own
   audio stream data to the mixer, the mixer node completes the mixing
   of different audio streams and then sends the final mixed audio
   stream to all the other UEs.

5.2. Video Stream Process

   Video stream processing is different from the audio stream processing.
   The video stream handling requires much more resources than the audio
   transmission, such as CPU ability and bandwidth. This section will
   introduce the procedures of video stream processing.

5.2.1. Video Stream Transmission

   For this section, When UE1 wants to watch the video of UE0, UE0's MCS
   is responsible to choose the transmission path according the UE
   capacity information stored in the overlay. Then UE0's MCS informs
   UE1 and UE0 the transmission path and UE0 starts transmit video
   stream. Figure 7 gives an example of the procedure.

   In this example, MCS1 serves UE1, MCS2 serves UE2 and UE3. The owner
   MCS stores the conference information.

   1. UE1 wants to watch UE3's video and sends request to its service
   MCS1;

   2. MCS1 asks Owner MCS through certain route policy for UE3's Service
   MCS information. Owner gives a response that MCS2 is the service MCS
   of UE3, MCS sends request to MCS2;

   3. MCS1 checks suitable video transmission path and find UE2 could be
   the relay node to transfer video stream;

   4. MCS1 informs the result to UE1, UE2 and UE3;

   5. UE3 starts sending its video stream to UE2 and UE2 transfer it to
   UE1.



   The video stream transmission mode from one node to another can be
   classified 3 kinds. Figure 8 shows the different cases of video
   transmission.

             Figure 8 Different Video Stream Transmission modes

   In this scenario, UE1 wants to watch UE2's video. The video steam can
   be transmitted in 3 ways:

   o Mode 1: When two UEs are in the same LAN or their network
      conditions can satisfy the requirement of the delay and bandwidth.
      The clients can be connected directly. UE2 can send its own video
      stream directly to UE1 without the help of other node.

   o Mode 2: When two UEs can't send video stream directly, MCS will
      try to find another UE to transfer the video stream. If MCS find
      the node UE3, then UE2'll send the stream to UE3 and UE3 transfers
      the stream to UE1.

   o Mode 3: If no UE can be found, MCS will undertake the process task.
      UE2 transfers its video stream to MCS2  MCS2 forwards the video
      stream to UE1's server MCS1. Finally, MCS1 sends video stream to
      UE1.

   In order to spare the server resource as much as possible, method 1
   and method 2 have a higher priority to be used.

5.2.2. Video Stream Delivery

   In a meeting, UE may need to send its video stream to several other
   UEs for watching. In order to make full use of the media transmission
   ability of UE node, an appropriate transmission model should be
   constructed, such as Tree-based model and Mesh-based model. The
   construction of the model should incorporate bandwidth, chip power,
   delay and other conditions, but the details still need to be further
   studied. Figure 9 gives an example of Tree-based transmission model.

                          +--------------+
                          | Video Source |
                          +--------------+

                             /        \
                            /          \
                           v            v
                   #---------#       #---------#
                   # Capable #       # Capable #
                   #  Peer1  #       #  Peer2  #
                   #---------#       #---------#
                     /     \            /    \
                    /       \          /      \
                   v         v        v        v
              ********    ********   ********    ********
              * Peer3*    * Peer4*   * Peer5*    * Peer6*
              ********    ********   ********    ********

                  Figure 9 Tree-based transmission model

   In the Tree-based model, the video source node, as the root of the
   tree, is responsible to construct and maintain the video multicast
   tree. Three aspects should be considered: First, the more capable the
   peer is, the lower the level it is. This ensures the powerful peers

   take the most jobs. Second, the level of the tree may be kept as low
   as possible to ensure the reality of the conference. Third, the tree
   should be stable enough to ensure the continuity of the conference.
   How to construct the multicast tree need to be further studied.

5.2.3. Video Stream Mixture

   In some cases, UE would like to watch several peers' video stream
   while its bandwidth is not enough for the video transmission.
   Therefore, different video stream need to be mixed together firstly,
   then forward to the destination. To find a proper mixer peer, lots of
   conditions should be considered, especially chip ability. The details
   still need to be further studied.

5.2.4. Video Stream Transmission Switch

   If selected node failed, the service MCS server will take it over or
   select new UE to undertake the task.

6. Kind Definition

   This section formally defines the DCMP-REGISTRATION kind.

      Name

         DCMP-REGISTRATION

      Kind IDs

         The Resource name DCMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is the Conference-
         URI. The data stored is the DcmpRegistration that contains a
         symbol of processing media and "performance_data" describing a
         UE node's capability and network condition in the conference.

      Data Model

         The data model for the DCMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is dictionary.
         The dictionary key is the Node-ID.

      Access Control

         USER-NODE-MATCH

7. Security Considerations

   This document does not currently consider the security considerations
   of this approach.  TODO.
