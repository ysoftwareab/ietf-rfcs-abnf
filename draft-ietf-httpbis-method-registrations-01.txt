Internet-Draft          HTTP Method Registrations          November 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document registers those Hypertext Transfer ProtocolHypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods which have been defined in
   standards-track RFCs before the IANA HTTP Method Registry was
   established.


2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations related to the registration
   itself.


3.  IANA Considerations

   Appendix A provides initial registrations of HTTP method names for
   the IANA HTTP Method registry at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods> (see Section 3.1 of
   [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics]).
