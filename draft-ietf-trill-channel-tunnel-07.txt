                 TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel Protocol
                <draft-ietf-trill-channel-tunnel-07.txt>


Abstract

   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol includes an optional mechanism, called RBridge Channel, that
   is specified in RFC 7178, for the transmission of typed messages
   between TRILL switches in the same campus and between TRILL switches
   and end stations on the same link. This document specifies two
   optional extensions to the RBridge Channel protocol: (1) A standard
   method to tunnel a variety of payload types by encapsulating them in
   an RBridge Channel message; and (2) A method to support security
   facilities for RBridge Channel messages. This document updates RFC
   7178.

INTERNET-DRAFT                             TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel


1. Introduction

   The IETF TRILL base protocol [RFC6325] has been extended with an
   optional RBridge Channel [RFC7178] facility to support transmission
   of typed messages (for example BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection) [RFC7175]) between two TRILL switches (RBridges) in the
   same campus and between RBridges and end stations on the same link.
   When sent between RBridges in the same campus, a TRILL Data packet
   with a TRILL header is used and the destination RBridge is indicated
   by nickname. When sent between a RBridge and an end station on the
   same link in either direction a native RBridge Channel messages
   [RFC7178] is used with no TRILL header and with the destination port
   or ports indicated by a MAC address. (There is no mechanism to stop
   end stations on the same link, from sending native RBridge Channel
   messages to each other; however, such use is outside the scope of
   this document.)

   This document updates [RFC7178] and specifies extensions to RBridge
   Channel that provide two additional facilities as listed below.  Use
   of each of these facilities is optional, except that if Channel
   Tunnel is implemented there are two payload types that MUST be
   implemented.

      (1) A standard method to tunnel a variety of payload types by
          encapsulating them in an RBridge Channel message.

      (2) A method to provide security facilities for RBridge Channel
          messages.

   Both of the above facilities can be used in the same packet. In case
   of conflict between this document and [RFC7178], this document takes
   precedence.



1.1  Terminology and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Channel Tunnel Packet Format

   The general structure of an RBridge Channel message between two TRILL
   switches (RBridges) in the same campus is shown in Figure 2.1 below.
   The structure of a native RBridge Channel message sent between an
   RBridge and an end station on the same link, in either direction, is
   shown in Figure 2.2 and, compared with the first case, omits the
   TRILL Header, inner Ethernet addresses, and Data Label. A Protocol
   field in the RBridge Channel Header gives the type of RBridge Channel
   message and indicates how to interpret the Channel Protocol Specific
   Payload [RFC7178].

   The RBridge Channel Header field specific to the RBridge Channel
   Tunnel Protocol is the Protocol field. Its contents MUST be the value
   allocated for this purpose (see Section 6).

   The RBridge Channel Tunnel Protocol Specific Data fields are as
   follows:

      SubERR: This field provides further details when a Channel Tunnel
         error is indicated in the RBridge Channel ERR field. If ERR is
         zero, then SubERR MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.
         See Section 5.

INTERNET-DRAFT                             TRILL: RBridge Channel Tunnel


      RESV4: This field MUST be sent as zero. If non-zero when received,
         this is an error condition (see Section 5).

      SType: This field describes the type of security information and
         features, including keying material, being used or provided by
         the Channel Tunnel packet. See Section 4.

      PType: Payload type. This describes the tunneled data. See Section
         3 below.

      Security Information: Variable length information. Length is zero
         if SType is zero. See Section 4.

   The Channel Tunnel protocol is integrated with the RBridge Channel
   facility.  Channel Tunnel errors are reported as if they were RBridge
   Channel errors, using newly allocated code points in the ERR field of
   the RBridge Channel Header supplemented by the SubERR field.

3. Channel Tunnel Payload Types

   The Channel Tunnel Protocol can carry a variety of payloads as
   indicated by the PType field. Values are shown in the table below
   with further explanation after the table.

         PType  Section  Description
         -----  -------  -----------
            0             Reserved
            1     3.1     Null
            2     3.2     Ethertype Without Addresses
            3     3.3     Ethertype With Addresses
         4-14             (Available for assignment by IETF Review)
           15             Reserved

                       Table 1. Payload Type Values

   While implementation of the Channel Tunnel protocol is optional, if
   it is implemented PType 1 (Null) and PType 2 (Ethertype without
   addresses) with the RBridge Channel Ethertype MUST be implemented.
   PType 2 for any Ethertypes other than the RBridge Channel Ethertype
   MAY be implemented. PType 3 MAY be implemented.

   The processing of any particular Channel Protocol message and its
   payload depends on meeting local security and other policy at the
   destination TRILL switch or end station.



3.1 Null Payload

   The Null payload type (PType = 1) is intended to be used for testing
   or for messages such as key negotiation or the like. It indicates
   that there is no payload. Any data after the Security Information
   field is ignored. If the Channel Tunnel feature is implemented, Null
   Payload MUST be supported. Any particular use of the Null Payload
   should specify what VLAN or priority should be used when relevant.



3.2 Ethertype Without Addresses

   A PType of 2 indicates that the payload of the Channel Tunnel message
   begins with an Ethertype. A TRILL switch supporting the Channel
   Tunnel RBridge Channel protocol MUST support a PType of 2 with a
   payload beginning with the RBridge Channel Ethertype as describe in
   Section 3.2.1. Other Ethertypes, including the TRILL and L2-IS-IS
   Ethertype as described in Section 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, MAY be supported.

3.2.1 Tunneled RBridge Channel Message

   A PType of 2 with an initial RBridge Channel Ethertype indicates an
   encapsulated RBridge Channel message payload. A typical reason for
   sending an RBridge Channel message inside a Channel Tunnel message is
   to provide security services, such as authentication or encryption.

   This payload type looks like the following:

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

           Figure 3.1 Tunneled RBridge Channel Message Structure



3.2.2 Tunneled TRILL Data Packet

   A PType of 2 and an initial TRILL Ethertype indicates that the
   payload of the Tunnel protocol message is an encapsulated TRILL Data
   packet as shown in the figure below.  If this Ethertype is supported
   for PType = 2 and the message meets local policy for acceptance, the
   tunneled TRILL Data packet is handled as if it had been received by
   the destination TRILL switch on the port where the Channel Tunnel
   message was received.

3.2.3 Tunneled TRILL IS-IS Packet

   A PType of 2 and an initial L2-IS-IS Ethertype indicates that the
   payload of the Tunnel protocol message is an encapsulated TRILL IS-IS
   PDU packet as shown in figure 3.3. If this Ethertype is supported,
   the tunneled TRILL IS-IS packet is processed by the destination
   RBridge if it meets local policy. One possible use is to expedite the
   receipt of a link state PDU (LSP) by some TRILL switch or switches
   with an immediate requirement for the link state information.  Since
   they can be transmitted directly on the link, a link local IS-IS PDU
   (Hello, CSNP, or PSNP [IS-IS]; MTU-probe or MTU-ack [RFC7176]; or
   circuit scoped FS-LSP, FS-CSNP or FS-PSNP [RFC7356]) would not
   normally be sent via this Channel Tunnel method except possibly to
   encrypt it.

3.3 Ethertype With Addresses

   If PType is 3, the Tunnel Protocol payload is an Ethernet frame as
   might be received from or sent to an end station except that the
   tunneled Ethernet frame's FCS is omitted, as shown in Figure 3.4.
   (There is still an overall FCS if the RBridge Channel message is
   being sent on an Ethernet link.) If this PType is implemented and the
   message meets local policy, the tunneled frame is handled as if it
   had been received on the port on which the Channel Tunnel message was
   received.

   The priority of the RBridge Channel message can be copied from the
   Ethernet frame VLAN tag, if one is present, except that priority 7
   SHOULD only be used for messages critical to adjacency and priority 6
   SHOULD only be used for other important control messages.

            Figure 3.4 Ethernet Frame Channel Tunnel Structure

   In the case of a non-Ethernet link, such as a PPP (Point-to-Point
   Protocol) link [RFC6361], the ports on the link are considered to
   have link local synthetic 48-bit MAC addresses constructed as
   described below.  These constructed addresses MAY be used as a MacSA.
   If the RBridge Channel message is link local, the source TRILL switch
   will have the information to construct such a MAC address for the
   destination TRILL switch port and that MAC address MAY be used as the
   MacDA. By the use of such a MacSA and either such a unicast MacDA or
   a group addressed MacDA, an Ethernet frame can be sent between two
   TRILL switch ports connected by a non-Ethernet link.

   These synthetic TRILL switch port MAC addresses for non-Ethernet
   ports are constructed as follows: 0xFEFF, the nickname of the TRILL
   switch used in TRILL Hellos sent on that port, and the Port ID that
   the TRILL switch has assigned to that port, as shown in Figure 3.5.
   (Both the nickname and Port ID of the port on which a TRILL Hello is
   sent appear in the Special VLANs and Flags sub-TLV [RFC7176] in that
   Hello.)  The resulting MAC address has the Local bit on and the Group
   bit off [RFC7042]. Since end stations are connected to TRILL switches
   over Ethernet, there will be no end stations on a non-Ethernet link
   in a TRILL campus. Thus such synthetic MAC addresses cannot conflict
   on the link with a real Ethernet port address.

   The following table gives the initial assigned values of the SType
   field and their meaning.

         SType  Section  Meaning
         -----  -------  -------
           0     4.4     None

          15             Reserved

                           Table 3. SType Values



4.1 Basic Security Format

   When SType is zero, there is no Security Information after the
   Channel Tunnel header and before the payload.  For all SType values
   except zero, the Security Information starts with a byte of flag bits
   and a byte of remaining length as follows:

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...
         |A|E|    RESV   |     Size      |   More Info
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...

                  Figure 4.1 Security Information Format

   The fields are as follows:

   A: Zero if authentication is not being provided. One if it is.

   E: Zero if encryption is not being provided. One if it is.

   RESV: Six reserved bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on
      receipt. In the future, meanings may be assigned to these bits and
      those meanings may differ for different STypes.

   Size: The number of bytes, as an unsigned integer, of More Info in
      the Security Information after the Size byte itself. Thus the
      maximum possible length of Security Information is 257 bytes for a
      Size of 255 plus the flags and Size bytes.

   More Info: Additional Security Information of length Size. Contents
      depends on the SType.

   The A and E bits are intended as hints and to assist in debugging.

   They are not guaranteed to be correct. They can be interpreted as
   follows:

       A E     Comments
      -----   ----------

       0 0    Neither authentication nor encryption is being provided.

       1 0    Authentication only. The payload should be parsable by a
              security ignorant receiver if it understands the payload
              format. The Size field permits skipping the More Info
              field.

       0 1    Encryption only, perhaps some form of opportunistic
              security [RFC7435].

       1 1    Authentication and Encryption.



4.2 Authentication and Encryption Coverage

   Authentication in the RBridge Channel case (see Figure 2.1) is
   computed across the inner Ethernet Addresses, Data Label, relevant
   Channel Tunnel header information, and the payload.

   To be more precise, the covered area starts with the byte immediately
   after the TRILL Header ingress nickname unless the optional flag word
   [rfc7180bis] is present.  If the optional flag word is present, then
   the covered area starts after that flag word. In either case, it
   extends to just before the TRILL Data packet link trailer.  For
   example, for an Ethernet packet it would extend to just before the
   FCS. If an authentication value is included in the More Info field
   shown in Section 4.1, it is treated as zero when authentication is
   calculated. If an authentication value is included in a payload after
   the security information, it is calculated as provided by the SType
   and security algorithms in use.

   Authentication in the native RBridge Channel case (see Figure 2.2),
   is as specified in the above paragraph except that it starts with the
   RBridge Channel Ethertype, since there are no TRILL Header, inner
   Ethernet address, or inner Data Label.

   If encryption is provided, it covers the payload from right after the
   Channel Tunnel header Security Information through to just before the
   TRILL Data packet link trailer.

4.3 Derived Keying Material

   In some cases, it is possible to use keying material derived from
   [RFC5310] IS-IS keying material. In such cases, the More Info field
   shown in Figure 4.1 includes a two byte Key ID to identify the IS-IS
   keying material. The keying material actually used in Channel Tunnel
   security is derived from the IS-IS keying material as follows:

      HKDF-Expand-SHA256 ( IS-IS-key, "Channel Tunnel" | 0x0S, L )

   where "|" indicates concatenation, HKDF is as in [RFC5869], SHA256 is
   as in [RFC6234], IS-IS-key is the input keying material, "Channel
   Tunnel" is the 14-character [RFC20] string indicated, 0x0S is a
   single byte where S is the SType for which this key derivation is
   being used, and L is the length of output keying material needed.



4.4 SType None

   No security services are being invoked. The length of the Security
   Information field (see Figure 2.4) is zero.



4.5 RFC 5310 Based Authentication

   The Security Information (see Figure 2.4) is the flags and Size bytes
   specified in Section 4.1 with the value of the [RFC5310] Key ID and
   Authentication Data as shown in Figure 4.2.

   o  Key ID: specifies the same keying value and authentication
      algorithm that the Key ID specifies for TRILL IS-IS LSP [RFC5310]
      Authentication TLVs. The keying material actually used is derived
      as shown in Section 4.3.

   o  Authentication Data: The authentication data produced by the key
      and algorithm associated with the Key ID acting on the packet as
      specified in Section 4.2. Length of the authentication data
      depends on the algorithm.



4.6 DTLS Based Security

   DTLS supports key negotiation and provides both encryption and
   authentication. This optional SType in Channel Tunnel uses DTLS 1.2
   [RFC6347]. It is intended for pairwise use. The presumption is that
   in the RBridge Channel case (Figure 2.1) the M bit in the TRILL
   Header would be zero and in the native RBridge Channel case (Figure
   2.2), the Outer.MacDA would be individually addressed.

   TRILL switches that implement the Channel Tunnel DTLS SType SHOULD
   support the use of certificates for DTLS. In this case the Size field
   shown in Section 4.1 MUST be zero and the Security Information is as
   shown in Figure 4.3.

   Also, if they support certificates, they MUST support the following
   algorithm:

   o  TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 [RFC5246]


                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                      |1|1|   RESV    |       0       |
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Figure 4.3 DTLS Cert or Special Pre-shared Key Security Information


   TRILL switches that support the Channel Tunnel DTLS SType MUST
   support the use of pre-shared keys for DTLS. The Size field as shown
   in Section 4.1 MUST be either zero or 2. If Size is zero as shown in
   Figure 4.3, a pre-shared key specifically associated with Channel
   Tunnel DTLS is used. If Size is 2 as shown in Figure 4.4, a two byte
   [RFC5310] Key ID is present and the pre-shared key is derived from
   the secret key associated with that Key ID as shown in Section 4.3.

   The following cryptographic algorithms MUST be supported for use with
   pre-shared keys:

        Figure 4.4 DTLS Derived Pre-shared Key Security Information


   When DTLS security is used, the entire payload of the Channel Tunnel
   packet, starting just after the Security Information and ending just
   before the link trailer, is a DTLS record [RFC6347].



4.7 RFC 5310 Based Encryption and Authentication

   This SType is based on pre-existing [RFC5310] keying material but
   does not use any algorithm that may be associated with a Key ID under
   [RFC5310].  Instead it uses the derived key as specified in Section
   4.3 with the algorithm specified by a Crypto Suite ID as shown in
   Figure 4.5. Key negotiation is not provided and this SType is
   intended for use in securing multi-destination packets. The
   presumption is that in the RBridge Channel case (Figure 2.1) the M
   bit in the TRILL Header would be one and in the native RBridge
   Channel case (Figure 2.2), the Outer.MacDA would be group addressed.

   The initially specified Crypto Suites is called CT-CCM-128 (Channel
   Tunnel Counter with CBC-MAC using AES-128), and is designed by Crypto
   Suite ID 0x0001.

   function. The minimum authentication field size permitted is 8
   octets.  There is additional authenticated data which is the

   authenticated data indicated in Section 4.2 up to but not including
   any of the Tunneled Data (Figure 2.4). The message size is limited to
   2**16 - 2**8 bytes so 2 bytes are used for the length of message
   field. There are thus 13 bytes available for nonce [RFC3610]. Since
   it is possible that the same Key ID could be used by different TRILL
   switches, the nonce MUST include an identifier for the originating
   TRILL switch. It is RECOMMENDED that this be the first 6 bytes of its
   IS-IS System ID as these will be unique across the campus.  The
   remaining 7 bytes (56 bits) need to be such that the nonce is always
   unique for a particular key, for example a counter for which care is
   taken that it is always incremented after each use and its value is
   preserved over TRILL switch crashes, re-starts, and the like. Should
   there be a danger of exhausting such a counter, the TRILL switch MUST
   take steps such as causing re-keying of the [RFC5310] key ID it is
   using and/or changing to use a different Key ID.

      there is an error in the processing of that nested message that
      results in a return RBridge Channel message with a non-zero ERR
      field,
   then that returned message SHOULD also be nested in an Channel Tunnel
   message using the same type of security. In this case, the ERR field
   in the Channel Tunnel envelope is set to 8 indicating that there is a
   nested error in the message being tunneled back.

6. IANA Considerations

   This section list IANA Considerations.



6.1 RBridge Channel Protocol Number

   IANA is requested to assign TBD as the RBridge Channel protocol
   number for the "Channel Tunnel" protocol from the range assigned by
   Standards Action.

   The added RBridge Channel protocols registry entry on the TRILL
   Parameters web page is as follows:

         Protocol  Description     Reference
         --------  --------------  ------------------

           TBD     Channel Tunnel   [this document]



6.2 Channel Tunnel Crypto Suites

   IANA is requested to create a subregistry in the TRILL Parameters
   registry as follows:

   Name: RBridge Channel Tunnel Crypto Suites
   Registration Procedures: Expert Review
   Reference: [this document]

    Value    Description      Reference
   -------  -------------    -----------
        0    Reserved
        1    CT-CCM          [this document]
   2-65534   available for assignment
     65535   Reserved

7. Security Considerations

   The RBridge Channel tunnel facility has potentially positive and
   negative effects on security.

   On the positive side, it provides optional security that can be used
   to authenticate and/or encrypt RBridge Channel messages. Some RBridge
   Channel message payloads, such as BFD [RFC7175], provide their own
   security but where this is not true, consideration should be given,
   when specifying an RBridge Channel protocol, to recommending or
   requiring use of the security features of the Tunnel Protocol.

   On the negative side, the optional ability to tunnel various payload
   types and to tunnel them between TRILL switches and to and from end
   stations can increase risk unless precautions are taken.  The
   processing of decapsulating Tunnel Protocol payloads is not a good
   place to be liberal in what you accept. This is because the tunneling
   facility makes it easier for unexpected messages to pop up in
   unexpected places in a TRILL campus due to accidents or the actions
   of an adversary. Local policies should generally be strict and only
   process payload types required and then only with adequate
   authentication for the particular circumstances.

   While simple [RFC5310] based authentication as specified in Section
   4.5 is better than nothing, in general it is RECOMMENDED that DTLS
   based security, as specified in Section 4.6, be used for all point-
   to-point Channel Tunnel messages and [RFC5310] based encryption and
   authentication, as specified in Section 4.7, be used for all multi-
   destination Channel Tunnel messages. If IS-IS authentication is not
   being used, then [RFC5310] keying information would not normally be
   available but that presumably represents a judgment by the TRILL
   campus operator that security is not needed.

   In connection with the use of DTLS for security as specified in
   Section 4.5, see [RFC7457].

   See [RFC7178] for general RBridge Channel Security Considerations and
   [RFC6325] for general TRILL Security Considerations.
