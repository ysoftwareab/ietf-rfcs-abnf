S = (AOR || " " || instance_ID || Call-ID || W || T1 || T2 || .. || Tn)

   Where || indicates concatenation, and T1, T2, and so on represent the
   current expiration times (measured in absolute time) of each contact
   with that instance ID.  Call-ID represents the Call-ID of the most
   recently registered contact for that AOR and instance ID.  Usage of
   the current expiration times allows a new value for S to be produced
   whenever a contact for that particular instance ID is refreshed,
   since a refresh always changes the expiration time.

   The stateless tokens in [25] include an expiration time and sequence
   number.  Expiration of temporary GRUU is determined through data
   within the state string S, and consequently, these fields can be set
   to zero.

   The GRUU is then constructed as:


user-part = "GRUU" || BASE64(T)
